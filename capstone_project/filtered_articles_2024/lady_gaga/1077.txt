Living up to the early-week projection, Charli XCX’s “360” officially enters the Top 10 on this week’s Mediabase pop radio airplay chart.
The “brat” single rises two places to #9 on this week’s chart, courtesy of the 8,479 spins it received during the September 15-21 tracking period. This week’s spin count tops last week’s mark by 729.
— As “360” enters the Top 10, Chappell Roan’s “HOT TO GO!” and Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars’ “Die With A Smile” secure Top 15 positions.
