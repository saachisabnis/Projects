There is nothing more 2010 than Katy Perry – which would be a compliment if it were 2010. 
But in 2024, the 39-year-old pop star’s attempted comeback represents everything that we left in the age of shutter shades and teal chevron for good reason. 
Perry’s first new single since 2021, Woman’s World, is a flop, with many critics deeming it not only musically uninspired but downright offensive.
The version of feminism the song espouses is dated, with its message easily summed up in slogans – like ‘Girl power!’ and ‘Girls can be bosses too!’ – that used to be emblazoned on tween girls’ T-shirts back when Perry was first popular.
The Guardian’s reviewer gave it one star and said: ‘I felt stupider every sorry time I listened to it.’ Dazed said, ‘Woman’s World feels about as empowering as an advert for Vagisil.’
A legion of fans agreed with the critics. Reddit user @mattysmwift wrote: ‘Genuinely mean this without any snark but I’m sorry but this is giving money laundering. 2 bland verses, extremely boring repetitive chorus played twice and NO BRIDGE?!’

@satomatic agreed: ‘She seems extremely out of touch (still doing quirky cringe millennial humor from 2010) but I agree it’s still baffling.’
To make matters worse, the accompanying music video is a series of shots of scantily clad women doing traditionally masculine jobs – something Perry later claimed on social media was meant as satire after critics got too loud to ignore. 
While Perry’s claim isn’t convincing anyone in this case, it is worth noting that caricature and satire are exactly what made Katy Perry a star in the first place. It’s just not working for her anymore. 
Take one of the catchiest pop songs of the 2010s, Perry’s California Gurls, for example. The cotton candy pop tune doesn’t have a whole lot more substance than Woman’s World, but in the landscape of the 2010s when Perry’s critically acclaimed Teenage Dream album came out, it not only made sense, it was empowering. 
In the chorus, Perry sings: ‘Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top / Sun-kissed skin, so hot / We’ll melt your popsicle / oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.’
It’s not exactly cutting cultural criticism, but when you consider the indie sleaze of the 2000s – a time that condemned anything overtly feminine while still demanding women aim to be desirable above all else and then shamed them for that aim –  there was something politically poignant about Perry’s unapologetically bubbly music. 
The entirety of Teenage Dream is a little girl’s cartoon bedtime story mixed with a party girl’s MySpace page – and it was proud of that in a way that caught people’s attention.
Lady Gaga, who rose to fame around the same time as Perry, made pop music in the 2010s that seemed to acknowledge an encroaching, almost biblical darkness that contrasted starkly to the clear blue skies of Teenage Dream.
While Gaga found her niche among the troubled club kids, Perry exploded up the charts because she offered escapism that was a different kind of commentary on the state of the world. 
One of the biggest differences between the two pop singers – who both wore outrageous outfits throughout the 2010s – was that while Lady Gaga never seemed to be wearing a costume, Katy Perry always did. Gaga appeared on red carpets wholly transformed by whatever bizarre look she had on while Perry always read more like a little girl playing dress up. 
This was precisely her appeal. Perry’s entire brand was the fantasy of unblemished femininity without any of the difficult realities of actual womanhood. 
But unlike Lady Gaga’s air of genuine otherworldliness, we never really thought that’s who Perry was: we saw the normal girl behind the aesthetic and assumed she was intentionally defying a more difficult reality.
When she wore a blue wig with a poodle skirt or blasted whipped cream out of her bra in the California Gurls music video, she caricatured her own femininity in a way that allowed fans to embrace the absurdity of modern life for a short time. 
So, now, in the midst of a pop renaissance in which Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, and Chapell Roan are all making waves, why isn’t Perry’s brand working?
Teenage Dream is an album that sounds as if Perry took every cultural critique that said pop was vapid, childish, and only about earworms, and used them as a recipe to create music.
There was something almost revolutionary (or at least kinda punk) about that defiance in the context of the time period, and it resulted in a masterpiece album of pop music: Teenage Dream created five No. 1 singles in the United States (previously only achieved by Michael Jackson’s Bad) and went platinum eight times. 
But it would never be a hit today. Perry’s best work was a kind of bubble gum pop that doesn’t make sense among newer, younger artists who are writing introspective, culturally critical songs to dancey beats. 
Additionally, the escapism that her music offers only connects if the realities and complexities of the feminine experience are hidden behind glossy fantasy. 
Her decision to collaborate with Dr. Luke on her new music, a producer who was accused of sexually abusing popstar Kesha for years, has soured that image possibly irreparably.
After all, a Woman’s World ought to include believing other women when they speak out against alleged abusers, right? Given that Perry also became a mother to a daughter in 2020, the contradiction is particularly upsetting.
It is worth noting that some believe that Perry is contractually obligated to work with Dr. Luke, but the star has yet to confirm or deny either way.
for the people asking why Katy Perry is working with Dr. Luke again is because sheâs still legally in contract with him for 3 more albums since PRISM and that means she can get sued by him if she doesnât work with him as much as she ignores him pic.twitter.com/uINaFu6ieb
Regardless, Perry’s association with the producer makes it impossible for listeners to disappear into her cartoon world without guilt. 
Even if it weren’t for this controversy and even if her new music was catchy, in a post-Roe v. Wade era in which women’s rights and autonomy are under threat across the globe, Perry’s brand of hyper-femme play-acting is no longer appealing. 
Instead, it reads as disconnected from reality and more than a little privileged. 
In fact,Woman’s World might be bad enough to retrospectively damage the rest of her discography.
Like when someone gets you a gift so fundamentally wrong for you you’re forced to wonder if they know you at all – or if every other meaningful gesture up to that point was just a fluke – Perry’s new single forces one to wonder if she was ever in on the joke. 
When she shot whipped cream out of her bra or emerged from a giant cupcake while batting anime-style eyelashes, was she actually doing so completely earnestly? Does she really live in a cartoon world where the solution to women’s problems is doing construction work in sequins? 
More than that, by refusing to reinvent herself and offering fans an almost condescendingly lazy version of her former brand, she’s forcing them to wonder: Are some things just better left in the 2010s?
