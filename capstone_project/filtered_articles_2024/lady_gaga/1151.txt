Whilst in Paris to perform at the opening ceremony of the Olympics, Lady Gaga decided to treat her fans to a preview of new music.
Following the ceremony, she posted on Instagram that she was going to treat her Parisian fans for their support whilst she was in the city: “I’m so deeply touched by my French fans this week outside the hotel. I’m gonna come out and say goodbye tonight with a few seconds of #LG7," she wrote, before teasing snippets of new music whilst in the back of a limousine.
