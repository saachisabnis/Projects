For the second consecutive week, Chase & Status' collaboration with Stormzy, ‘BACKBONE’, is your number one on the Official Big Top 40.
Some tracks (like our Number 1) aren't budging from the Top 10, but Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' new duet, 'Die With A Smile', went straight to Number 3 despite only being released in the UK on Friday!

On last week's show, Will Manning chatted to Saul from Chase & Status about teaming up with Stormzy on 'BACKBONE', which went straight to the top of the chart last Sunday.
After Stormzy originally sang against a drill beat, the duo switched to a drum and bass background before teasing the track in the biggest way possible - playing it to the crowds at American music festival, Coachella.

In addition to Lady Gaga and Bruno going straight to Number 3, we've had 2 other new entries on the Big Top 40 this week from the queens of dance and pop... of course we're talking about The Blessed Madonna and Kylie Minogue's new floor filler, ‘Edge of Saturday Night’, plus ‘Playing for Time’ from Axxima feat. C.E.Q is in at Number 30.
Amongst our newcomers are some huge re-entries from The Goo Goo Dolls thanks to 'Deadpool & Wolverine' fever, and with Taylor back in town, Swifties have 'Fortnight' back on repeat.
Can Chase & Status and Stormzy make it a hattrick at Number 1 next week? Could we see the return of Shaboozey for a fourth week, or could a full week from Gaga and Bruno see them go up 2 spots on the Official Big Top 40?
Listen next Sunday from 4pm on Global Player to find out!
