Some of the most iconic roles in film and TV could have looked very different had they gone to the original casting choices.
Before Billy Crudup brought Stillwater singer Russell Hammond to life in the 2000 music drama, director Cameron Crowe had his eye on Brad Pitt, who was “just starting out” in his now-legendary career. “He just really had something,” Crowe gushed during the premiere episode of the “Origins: Almost Famous Turns Twenty” podcast in July 2020.
While Pitt nailed his audition — and had Crowe “rolling on the floor” in laughter — it just wasn’t the perfect fit for that moment. Crowe even admitted that he “wept” when the Fight Club star pulled out of the project.

“But I think in the back of my brain, I knew that he had never fully fallen in love with the character,” Crowe said. “He had fallen in love with the idea of the character. But, maybe there just wasn’t enough on the page.”

During a February 2025 radio interview with Capital FM, Hudson said it was a “bad call” turning down the lead role in The Devil Wears Prada. “It was a timing thing,” she explained, adding, “I couldn’t do it, and I should’ve, like, made it happen, and I didn’t. … Everything happens for a reason. There’s a reason for that.”

Judy Greer shared she was asked to audition for Claire Dunphy in the iconic sitcom Modern Family.
"This was a time in my career when I was starting to [play characters with kids]," Greer said on a November 2024 episode of the “Dinner’s on Me With Jesse Tyler Ferguson” podcast. "It sounds so silly to say it out loud now, but I'll be honest. In a movie, I would have a kid. And then there was this opportunity to audition where I would have three kids, one of them in high school, and on a TV show … and you do have to think of these things in success, and obviously Modern Family was a huge success. In a movie, people kind of see it and then they forget. In a TV show, it's just like, you're a mom."
Greer noted that she “didn’t even want kids.” She added, "That was not even on the table for me. And so I was like, 'I think I'm not going to audition for it.' I was really torn about it, but I ended up obviously not. So who knows if I would have even gotten it anyway, but I was sort of just like, 'I don't know if I want to be America's mom yet.'"
Greer admitted that she felt the role was “so limiting compared to what I was doing already.” She added, “And in addition to just the perception of who you are as an actor. It's lifestyle too. I was like, well, I like traveling a lot, and I like doing all these movies, and I like going to all these places, and I like meeting all these people. … I wasn’t ready for it in and out of my career.”

The “Burnin' Up” singer revealed that he almost portrayed the iconic superhero in the 2012 movie. 
"In the moment, you're destroyed or you're defeated. But you realize this person was brilliant. I remember years ago I was up for Spider-Man and I was so, so excited and it was the year Andrew Garfield got it," Jonas recalled during a November 2022 “Just for Variety” podcast episode. "Obviously, he was the right one."
The Devotion actor added that it was a “big thing” getting called back — and thought he might have a leg up in the audition process due to director Mar Webb initially making his name in music videos before switching to feature films. 
"I was like, 'I got an in here,'" the DNCE musician said. "But you know what? I love the process of auditioning and putting yourself out there and having to prove yourself."

The directors of Scream 4 wanted to kick off the film with an homage to the iconic cold-open murder sequence in the first Scream movie, and asked Stewart to play Ghostface's first victim.
"It’s the Drew [Barrymore] character that gets killed in the beginning," the Oscar nominee told Slant in March 2022 about the part she was offered in the horror franchise. "And they created a whole sequence where a lot of people got killed to emulate the Drew thing. But it was just going to be one person, and I was like, 'I can’t do a Drew. I can’t touch that.'"
The screenwriters ultimately decided on a "larger sequence" with more than one victim. Despite turning Scream down the first time, Stewart is open to potentially appearing in another sequel down the line. "I would read the script. I love Neve Campbell so much," she said. "I love that movie. I’ve watched it recently, as an adult though. It’s so gnarly. ... It’s not just a slasher flick. It’s a beautiful movie."

Director P.J. Hogan's first choice for the leading man wasn't Dermot Mulroney.
“My first choice was actually Russell Crowe,” Hogan told Vulture in February 2022. “Russell was, I thought, probably the most amazing actor I had ever encountered. I kind of knew Russell was going to be a really big star.”
He got as far as a table read with Julia Roberts — and that's where it all went wrong. “It was one of the worst table reads I’ve ever experienced," Hogan revealed. "Russell was seated opposite Julia. He gripped that script, and he stared at that script, and he didn’t look at her once. He read every line in a monotone. At one point, Julia was literally leaning over the table, staring, like, inches from Russell’s face, trying to make eye contact. And he wouldn’t look at her. At the end of the reading, Russell came up to me and said, ‘I thought that went pretty well.’ And then I knew: Russell was not going to be in My Best Friend’s Wedding.”

Kidman revealed that she was originally cast as the lead in 2002's Panic Room before an injury changed her plans. The role eventually went to Jodie Foster.
"We were meant to work together," Kidman told Kristen Stewart during Variety's Actors on Actors series in January 2022. "I remember [director] David Fincher saying, 'Oh, my God, we have discovered the most incredible actress.' And then I got injured and ended up not playing your mama."
Stewart, for her part, recalled Kidman's brief time on set fondly, adding, "We spent a couple weeks rehearsing. I have a vivid memory of it, because the way you treat kids is so telling. I felt like I was buds with you. It was two or three weeks, but I was always like, 'She’s one of my friends.' You gave me walkie talkies for Christmas."

Nicole Kidman played the I Love Lucy star in Amazon's Being the Ricardos, but before she took on the role, Blanchett was announced as the star. Eventually, the Thor: Ragnarok actress backed out of the biopic, citing scheduling conflicts. She has no regrets, though.
“It became the movie it needed to be,” Blanchett said during an appearance on Variety's "Awards Circuit" podcast in January 2022, days after Kidman won a Golden Globe for her performance.
She continued, “Those things happen in the right way, at the right time. In the best possible way, you don’t always envisage the same thing; and then it goes on to become a different entity.”

"I think I was one of, like, 8,000 young ladies who read for Monica and Courteney Cox got her," Davis recalled during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in December 2021. "Courteney and I were in the same yoga class at the time and we used to hang out. The rest of us were, like, unemployed actor waitresses types and we would hang out after class."
She continued: "One day, Courteney was like, 'Hey, guys. Do you want to come car shopping with me? We were like, 'Wow, car shopping!' [Courteney] said, 'I did this pilot, I'm feeling really good about it. I think I'm going to buy a Porsche.' We were like, 'Wow, is she for real?' It was Friends, and it did go very well."

The Pearl Harbor star revealed in December 2021 that he was set to play Heath Ledger’s character, Ennis Del Mar, in 2005’s Brokeback Mountain before having a scheduling conflict.

The former Colbert Report host revealed during a December 2021 episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that he once auditioned to play a guy who goes on a date with Miranda, played by Cynthia Nixon. Unfortunately, the fictional suitor was struggling with gastrointestinal issues after eating spicy biryani — but even worse, Colbert’s acting stunk up the joint so badly that he lost the role. “Evidently I did not have the acting chops to act like I have diarrhea,” he confessed.

“James [Gunn] and I knew each other, we were friends, we would have game nights at each other’s homes, had a lot of mutual friends,” the Chuck alum recalled on “The Fourth Wall” podcast in November 2021. “And so he had asked me to come in and read for Star-Lord, and I did, and then that led to the next step, and then all of a sudden I was camera testing. Oh man, I wanted that role so bad, like, so, so, so, so bad.”
Levi added at the time: “But eventually, and I think smartly, [Chris Pratt] decided to take the job and so it didn’t go my way, but I hoped I left enough of a good impression with James that when I was auditioning for Shazam, [after] his very dear friend and manager, Peter Safran, calls up James because this is how our industry works. Fortunately, I was in good standing with James … and I think between that and how well James thought I did in the Star-Lord test, he said, ‘Yeah man, you really should give Zach an opportunity at this. I really think he could be great.’”

Screenwriter James Ivory revealed that the Honey Boy actor almost starred alongside Timothée Chalamet in the 2017 film. After LaBeouf’s audition with the Dune star, director "Luca [Guadagnino] and I had been blown away," he wrote in his 2021 memoir, Solid Ivory, according to GQ. "The reading by the two young actors had been sensational; they made a very convincing hot couple." However, LaBeouf’s “bad publicity” at the time ultimately led the movie’s director to go in a different direction. "Luca cast Armie Hammer and never spoke to, or of, Shia again,” Ivory noted.

The Halloween Kills actor turned down the starring role in the 1986 teen comedy written and directed by his longtime collaborator John Hughes — and he still regrets it. In an October 2021 interview, the Brat Pack alum revealed that the writer-director, who he worked with on Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, wrote the role of Ferris Bueller for him, but "because of the work [Hughes] gave me, he gave me a career as a kid, I was busy with other work. So I wasn't able to do Ferris,” he told Insider. It was a running theme for Hall in those days. The Weird Science actor also said he passed up playing Ducky in Pretty in Pink, another Hughes-written film, because of his hectic schedule. However, he wishes he would have found the time to make Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. “I thought there was a real uniqueness to Ferris," the Edward Scissorhands actor explained. "I thought that would have been a lot of fun.”

During an October 2021 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the “Material Girl” singer revealed she turned down a role in the 1999 science fiction film. "Can you believe that? That's, like, one of the best movies ever made,” she told host Jimmy Fallon, adding, “A teeny-tiny part of me regrets just that one moment in my life."
However, it’s not the only big movie the Dick Tracy actress declined. She also said no to playing Catwoman in 1992’s Batman Returns and to starring in 1995’s Showgirls. "I saw them both and I regret that I turned down Catwoman, that was pretty fierce," she said of the part that eventually went to Michelle Pfeiffer. “Showgirls? No.”

The Bring It On star auditioned for a role in the 1999 film alongside “everyone and their mother” so she knew she had to stand out. “To me, I needed to feel like the most powerful, beautiful, and amazing woman in the world,” she said on The Late Late Show With James Corden in October 2021. “So of course, I wanted to channel Janet Jackson.”
To become the “Rhythm Nation” singer, Union spared no expense. “I wanted to get the good hair, the Janet hair, from the weave emporium,” she said. “I literally [found] the exact outfit from her album cover. I [drew] in the damn mole. I [was] fully committed.”
When she went to the tryout, she felt confident. “Then in walks Janet,” the You Got Anything Stronger? author said. The R&B icon was also auditioning for a role in the Keanu Reeves movie “and I’m cosplaying as Janet, with a weird drawn-on mole,” Union joked.
Both women lost out on the role and the Being Mary Jane alum believes she knows why. “I think we canceled each other out,” she said. “I’m pretty sure there was a restraining order of sorts.”

Director Peter Chelsom says that Aniston met with him about Kate Beckinsale’s role in the 2001 romance, but the Morning Show star wanted to try different genres since Friends already gave her so much rom-com material.
"I remember when she came in, she said, 'I do a romantic comedy once a week,' her being on Friends at the time, so she clearly had other things on her plate and it was her decision not to do it," Chelsom recalled to Insider in October 2021 for the film's 20th anniversary. "She had come to meet with me in good faith without an offer, but we definitely would have made her an offer if she wanted to make it."

Owen Wilson was always the first choice for Hansel, but Ben Stiller recalled nearly having to recast him when scheduling conflicts came up. They even started the audition process, and Stiller says the only audition for the 2001 film that he can recall was the Velvet Buzzsaw actor.
“The only one that I remember clearly was a young Jake Gyllenhaal doing this wide-eyed version of Hansel that was really funny,” the actor told Esquire in September 2021.

The Goodfellas star said rumors he was up for James Gandolfini's role of Tony Soprano on the HBO drama are false. However, he'd been approached to play another character on the hit. 
“David [Chase, creator of ‘The Sopranos’] once talked to me about playing Ralphie [eventually played by Joe Pantoliano]. But never Tony," Liotta told The Guardian in September 2021.
While promoting his film The Many Saints of Newark, a prequel to The Sopranos, Liotta explained that he turned down the role in the original series. “I didn’t want to do another mafia thing, and I was shooting 'Hannibal.' It just didn’t feel right at the time," he said.

The Zero Dark Thirty actress revealed that she turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts. "I love [director] David O. Russell … love, love, love, and I've always wanted to work with him. And I got offered American Hustle, the Jennifer Lawrence part," Chastain revealed on the “Happy, Sad, Confused” podcast in September 2021. “I wanted to do it. It conflicted with [director] Liv Ullmann and Miss Julie. I had been attached to that for a long time and I worship Liv Ullmann, so I had to say, like, 'Sorry, there's conflict'. And it didn't work out.”
Chastain has no regrets, despite Lawrence’s Oscar nomination. “Everything happens for a reason because Jennifer was also way better than I ever would've been in that part," she added.

Before Charles Michael Davis joined TVD as Originals vampire Marcel, he had some competition for the part. Show creator Julie Plec told Entertainment Weekly in August 2021 that they also considered the Mandalorian star for the part.
"One of the other people who read opposite Charles for that part was Pedro Pascal, who I loved," she recalled to the outlet at the time. "I was obsessed with him, but he was just on the older side." 
It was the Younger alum who ultimately won the part, which the Legacies creator credited to Davis' "swagger.” Plec explained that Marcel needed swag to “operate and breathe in the same place as Klaus.”

Barbra Streisand revealed that she would have preferred to see Beyoncé and Will Smith appear as the main couple of 2018's A Star Is Born."At first, when I heard it was going to be done again, it was supposed to be Will Smith and Beyoncé, and I thought, that's interesting," Streisand told The Sunday Project in August 2021. "Really make it different again, different kind of music, integrated actors, I thought that was a great idea. So, I was surprised when I saw how alike it was to the version that I did in 1976." Although the rumored casting wasn't meant to be, the singer admitted that her view of the remake was affected by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga taking over those roles. "I don’t know. I thought it was the wrong idea," she added at the time. "But hey, look, it was a big success, and I can’t argue with success but I don't care about so much success as I do originality."

The actress was cast as Dottie, the character ultimately played by Geena Davis, and she even spent three months training with the Chicago Cubs. However, she quit after Madonna was cast as Mae Mordabito, claiming the movie would be “an Elvis film.” She told The Telegraph she still got paid for the role.
“The studio agreed with me … because it was the only time I ever collected a pay-or-play on my contract. In other words, I collected my pay even though I did not play, and that’s very hard to get in a court,” she revealed.
Winger watched the final film, but she thought the cast was not convincing as “As entertaining as [the final film] was, you don’t walk away going ‘Wow, those women did that,’” she added. “You kind of go ‘Is that true?’”

The Broadway alum almost played the Hogwarts professor in the 2002 sequel, but salary disputes took him out of the running. 
“They wanted me and Rupert Everett to do a screen test, and they said they couldn’t pay me more than a certain sum, they just didn’t have any more money in the budget,” the Scottish actor told The Telegraph in August 2021. “And I had the same agent as Rupert, who of course, they were going to pay more. … I said, 'Tell them to f—k right off.' … And then they f—king gave it to Kenneth Branagh, came out of the shadows."

Reese Witherspoon’s love interest in 2001’s Legally Blonde could’ve been completely different. Paul Bettany, who is now best known as Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, auditioned for the role. However, he lost the part once producers decided they needed an actor who was born in the states. “I loved Paul Bettany for the Luke role, but he was British, and they felt like it needed to be a real American,” casting director Joseph Middleton told the New York Times in July 2021. Eventually, producers realized the part they called “the Luke Wilson role” needed to be played by the Texas native.

The Hunger Games star was in talks for Dakota Fanning’s role of Squeaky Fromme in the Oscar-winning drama, according to creator Quentin Tarantino. “Early on, in the pre-production of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, I flirted around with the idea of — and [by the way], I couldn’t be happier with what Dakota Fanning did, it’s one of the best performances in the movie. She’s amazing as Squeaky Fromme,” Tarantino said on a June 2021 episode of Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast. “She becomes [her]. But early on, I investigated the idea of Jennifer Lawrence playing Squeaky. She came down to the house to read the script cause I wasn’t letting it out. So, she came down to the house and I gave her the script and said, ‘Go in my living room or go outside by the pool and read it.’”The Pulp Fiction director recalled Lawrence being “interested” in the role after she read the script but noted that “something didn’t work out” when it came to final casting decisions. “She’s a very nice person, and I respect her as an actress,” he added.

“We offered it to Rachel McAdams three times. The studio was determined to have her, and she was determined not to do it,” director David Frankel explained to Entertainment Weekly in June 2021. After back-to-back hits with The Notebook and Mean Girls, the actress wanted to focus on less mainstream films, clearing the way for Anne Hathaway to play the part in the 2006 film.

Harrison Ford took the lead role in the franchise as the archeologist, but it could've been Tom Selleck. Karen Allen, who played Marion Ravenwood opposite Ford as Indiana Jones, revealed the Friends alum's TV career forced him to turn down the gig. "Tom Selleck had been cast, and then it turned out Magnum P.I. got picked up," she told Variety in June 2021. "They wouldn’t let him out of his contract, and so he was heartbroken. I only know that way after the fact because I sat with him many years later and he told me how heartbroken he was."
Allen also revealed that Sam Elliot, Jeff Bridges, Tim Matheson and John Shea auditioned for Steven Spielberg's 1981 hit.

During a conversation on the "Happy Sad Confused" podcast in February 2021, Mortensen recalled how his son, Henry, had a hand in his decision to give up the role of superhero Wolverine before Hugh Jackman ultimately secured the gig. "The thing that bothered me at the time was just the commitment of endless movies of that same character over and over. I was nervous about that," Mortensen recalled of early meetings with director Bryan Singer. "And also there were some things — I mean, they straightened most of them out, but I did take Henry to the meeting I had with the director as my sort of good luck charm and guide. In the back of my mind, I was thinking he could learn something, too, because I did let Henry read the script and he goes, 'This is wrong. That's not how it is.'"
Henry had strong feelings about the way Wolverine would be portrayed on the big screen. "All of a sudden, the director is falling all over himself and then the rest of the meeting was him explaining in detail to Henry why he was taking certain liberties," the actor said. "We walked out of there and Henry asks if he will change the things he told him about, and I say, 'I don't think so. I'm not going to do it anyway, because I'm not sure I want to be doing this for years. And then, a couple of years later, I'm doing three Lord of the Rings [movies]."

It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Patrick Dempsey portraying McDreamy on the ABC medical drama, but the part nearly went to the Parks and Recreation alum. “This is what longevity, experience and recovery give you. There are no accidents,” Lowe said to Variety in February 2021 of passing on Grey’s Anatomy for the short-lived series Dr. Vegas. “Whatever decision you come to, if you come to it from the right place, it's never wrong.”
The 9-1-1: Lone Star actor added, “Me in that part isn't as interesting as Patrick in that part. If it’d been me, [the fans] wouldn’t have called me ‘McDreamy,’ they would have called me Rob Lowe.”

The Maleficent: Mistress of Evil actress was initially offered to play FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs before Jodie Foster signed on for the 1991 film, which went on to win five Oscars. “With The Silence of the Lambs, I was trepidatious,” Pfeiffer told The New Yorker in January 2021. “There was such evil in that film. The thing I most regret is missing the opportunity to do another film with [director Jonathan Demme]. It was that evil won in the end, that at the end of that film evil ruled out. I was uncomfortable with that ending. I didn't want to put that out into the world.”

"We just wanted to do it because we wanted to work together, [but] it ended up being not the right thing for us to do."

“I had that role. I didn’t even have to audition for it, but at the time I felt like I was not a good enough actor and I wanted to cement my career in music,” she continued. “I thought, one day I will do acting, but I’m not going to throw myself into this and not be good at it.”

He could have been a "golden God!" Director Cameron Crowe revealed that the Oklahoma native was at the top of his mind while "in the early stages" of casting the beloved 2000 film. "I had a really good meeting with him around the time of Say Anything," Crowe explained during a July 2020 episode of the "Origins: Almost Famous Turns Twenty" podcast. "And he was just starting out, and he just really had something." Pitt read for the role of Russell Hammond, which later went to Billy Crudup, with early Penny Lane favorite Natalie Portman (the role eventually went to Kate Hudson). Ultimately, both Crowe and Pitt realized it wasn't the right fit. "I think in the back of my brain, I knew that he had never fully fallen in love with the character," the director said. "He had fallen in love with the idea of the character. But, maybe there just wasn't enough on the page."

It’s no secret that Cameron Diaz made her star turn as Jim Carrey love interest Tina Carlyle in The Mask, but the part was nearly played by a very different blonde actress. Ahead of the film’s 25th anniversary, director Chuck Russell revealed to Variety on July 28 that he initially wanted Smith for the role. “Anna was charming and bubbling, but did not have other qualities needed for the role,” he told the publication of the late actress. “I never took the next step to run scenes with her.” Although Diaz had no prior acting credits, Russell wound up asking her to come read for the part after coming across her 8x10 photo on the casting deck. Now, the rest is history!

Audiences have seen Fraser dabble within the superhero genre before, starring as Cliff Steele/Robotman in Doom Patrol. His resume is also stacked with action movie credits, largely due to his involvement in the Mummy franchise. However, he revealed to Yahoo! Entertainment in June 2019 that he nearly donned a cape to play the Kryptonian hero, which he, literally, tried on for size. “You feel kind of invincible, [like] ‘I can fly,’” he said, describing his experience wearing the iconic Superman suit. “The cape actually makes you think you have the power of flight even though you know you don’t.”

The Oscar winner was offered the role of Neo before Keanu Reeves landed the gig. “We went out to so many people I don’t remember. We were getting desperate,” producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura told The Wrap in March 2019 ahead of the film’s 20th anniversary. “We went to Sandy Bullock and said, ‘We’ll change Neo to a girl.’ [Producer] Joel Silver and I worked with Sandy on Demolition Man and she was and continues to be a very good friend of mine. It was pretty simple. We sent her the script to see if she was interested in it. And if she was interested in it, we would try to make the change.” 
However, Bullock wasn’t interested. “It just wasn’t something for her at the time,” di Bonaventura explained. “So really, it didn’t go anywhere.”

We were getting desperate,” producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura told The Wrap in March 2019 ahead of the film’s 20th anniversary. “We went to Sandy Bullock and said, ‘We’ll change Neo to a girl.’ [Producer] Joel Silver and I worked with Sandy on Demolition Man and she was and continues to be a very good friend of mine. It was pretty simple. We sent her the script to see if she was interested in it. And if she was interested in it, we would try to make the change.”

The Parks & Rec actor initially discussed how he turned down the major TV role in his 2011 memoir, Stories I Only Tell My Friends. Lowe divulged that he was already in contract negotiations to star on an upcoming CBS show called Dr. Vegas when he got a call from the ABC producers. "I agreed to meet with the people making Grey's Anatomy. I had read it and loved it — the writing was crisp, real and very entertaining — and it's always been a good idea to hear out talented people," he recalled. "'We would be thrilled if you would play Dr. Derek Shepherd,' they said right off the bat. I was torn. Grey's was a much better script; in fact, there was no comparison."
 
During a March 2019 podcast episode of "WTF With Marc Maron," the Californication actor brought it up again. “Dude, I turned down Grey's Anatomy ... to play McDreamy." He added, "That probably cost me $70 million dollars!” The About Last Night star explained, “But at the end of the day, I watched it when it came out, and when they started calling the handsome doctor 'McDreamy,' I said, 'Yeah, that’s not for me.'” The role eventually went to Patrick Dempsey, who played the heartthrob from 2005 to 2015.

"That's the comic we read when we were kids," Damon told the New York Daily News in September 2015. "But when that one came along (in 2003), I chickened out, because I couldn't tell.

While appearing on the Howard Stern Show in February 2023, the Whale actor shared he was up for the role of Superman in the 2006 film that starred Brandon Routh.
"Everyone in town was reading for Superman. They were testing six or seven guys in 2002 or 2003," Fraser recalled to Stern. "Of course, it's a life-changing, amazing opportunity, but I had to reconcile with, 'Okay, say you do get the job to be the Man of Steel. It's going to be chipped on your gravestone. Are you okay with that? You will forevermore be known as the Man of Steel.' There was a sort of Faustian bargain that went into [the] feeling, and I think inherently I didn't want to be known for only one thing, because I prided myself on diversity my whole professional life. I'm not a one-trick pony."
As the Mummy star shared his disappointment over missing out on the role, he hypothesized the reason might have been due to "shenanigans and studio politics" and his screen test.
