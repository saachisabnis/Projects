With their seemingly endless appearances on award ceremony red carpets – from the Golden Globes to the Emmys, Baftas and Oscars – the faces of the film and TV world’s finest stars are well-known.
The 76th British Academy Film Awards will be held on February 18 and the nominations have been revealed.
Some of the biggest movies of 2023 are expected to receive trophies such as Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon.
Christopher Nolan's epic biopic about atomic bomb creator J Robert Oppenheimer dominated the main categories, with nominations for the actors, in Best Film and for Nolan in Best Director.
In comparison, Oppenheimer's box office rival Barbie received just five nominations.
People can expect to see the likes of Martin Scorsese, Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie walking down the red carpet next month at the ceremony.
But what about their often unsung partners? Can you match the actor or actress to their real-life other halves?
1) STARK CONTRAST: Susan surely shares laundry chores with her husband... she fills the washing machine, and he’s the Iron Man
2) MEET THE PARENTS: Producer Tiffany Chen gave birth to her partner’s seventh child last year. He must be a good fella
3) OFFICE ROMANCE: John Krasinski starred in the US version of Ricky Gervais’s sitcom – and directed his wife to go to A Quiet Place... twice

7) TOY BOY: Tom Ackerley produces films with his wife, a real doll whose on-screen partners have included a real Joker and a Wolf Of Wall Street
8) IN THE PINK: Screenwriter Noah Baumbach is Ken to this actress-turned-director’s Barbie – they even write together in their dream house
9) PROMISING YOUNG MAN: Producer Chris Vernon must feel like a King... since his wife was Camilla on The Crown before directing Saltburn
10) KEEPING SCORES: Marcus Mumford may be a musician, but he’s no Maestro in the same league as his wife’s latest on-screen husband
11) THE RIGHT DIRECTION: Helen Morris and her husband could get a Taxi Driver to take them to a Casino to discover The Colour Of Money
12) KINKY: Clara Wong played her partner’s dominatrix on TV... all we can say is that she must have a pretty good Holdover him
1)  HIS STRONG SUIT: Robert Downey Jr
