Taking to TikTok, Lady Gaga has shared her thoughts on the infamous Facebook group created by her old classmates.
Over 20 years ago, Lady Gaga's classmates at NYU decided to rally against her and bully her into thinking that her dreams weren't achievable. They started the Facebook group, “Stefani Germanotta, You Will Never Be Famous”, which of course had the internet in stitches once they got their hands on it as Lady Gaga had the last laugh.

Taking to TikTok, Lady Gaga has acknowledged the Facebook group, and shared words of advise for anybody in similar situations where they're surrounded by people who do not have faith in them. "Some people I went to college w made this way back when," she wrote. "This is why you can’t give up when people doubt you or put you down — gotta keep going."
Lady Gaga is currently gearing up for the release of her seventh studio album.
