While her upcoming album may not be a rock album, it does not mean that Gaga does not have experience with the rock genre. She previously did a tribute to rock singer David Bowie at the 2016 Grammy Awards.
The following year, she performed at the 2017 Grammy Awards with heavy metal pioneers Metallica, where she kept up with lead singer James Hetfield.
Last year, Gaga collaborated with rock legends The Rolling Stones on their song "Sweet Sounds of Heaven" from their latest album, Hackney Diamonds.
What is known about Gaga's year ahead is that she will be in the sequel to the movie Joker from 2019. Titled Joker: Folie à Deux, she play the role of Harley Quinn.
