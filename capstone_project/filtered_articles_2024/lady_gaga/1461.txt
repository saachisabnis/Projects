Lady Gaga is happy to embrace the challenge
The chart-topping singer has already enjoyed a huge amount of success in the music industry, but Gaga acknowledged that she's now entering a new phase of her career.
The New York-born star told Buzzfeed Canada: "I’m 38 years old, and it’s kind of fun to embrace the challenge of being a 38-year-old pop star and figuring out who I want to be now and what I want to say because I really love women.
"I really want to be a voice that deserves to be part of our community."
Gaga also revealed that she's excited to "have a family" with her fiance, Michael Polansky.

The 'Poker Face' hitmaker - who got engaged earlier this year - shared: "I am so happy to be in love, and I’m so excited to have a family, so that’s definitely number one. But also, I really believe in the ability to grow as a person."

In August, a source revealed that Gaga and Michael are "already thinking about wedding plans".

The loved-up couple are actually weighing up the idea of tying the knot in Europe.

The insider told 'Entertainment Tonight': "Gaga and Michael are the happiest they've ever been. 

"Michael has always known Gaga was the one. They had an engagement party at her home in Malibu with their loved ones and everyone is thrilled for them." 

Gaga - whose real name is Stefani Germanotta - and Michael hope to get married "sooner than later".

The source shared: "They are already thinking about wedding plans and talking about possibly having a destination wedding in Europe. They'd love to get married sooner than later and both want to start a family."
