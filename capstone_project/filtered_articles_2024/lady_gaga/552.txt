Warner Bros. Pictures has premiered the official teaser trailer for filmmaker Todd Phillips’ highly anticipated “Joker: Folie a Deux” starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.
The R-rated 2019 “Joker” grossed $1 billion and landed Joaquin Phoenix the best actor Oscar. Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck here in a story that will reportedly unfold almost entirely within Gotham City’s Arkham Asylum and will have musical elements.
Lady Gaga, Zazie Beetz, Catherine Keener, Brendan Gleeson, and Jacob Lofland co-star in the movie which Phillips once again directs from a script he wrote with Scott Silver.
The trailer release follows Phillips himself touting the movie at CinemaCon in Las Vegas where he downplayed the musical elements – saying that though it is an essential element, the film doesn’t veer too far from the first.
Previously it has been said the new film will take its visual inspiration from Francis Ford Coppola’s lavish musical “One from the Heart”.   It’s also said to sport several times larger than its predecessor.
The project is considered a DC Elseworlds project, thus is not part of the Peter Safran and James Gunn DC Universe.  “Joker: Folie a Deux” is slated to premiere in cinemas on October 4th.
