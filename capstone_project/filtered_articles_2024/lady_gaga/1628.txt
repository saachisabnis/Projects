Warner Bros. has released two new posters for Joker: Folie √Ä Deux, as the early reviews and reactions continue to circulate online.
Joker: Folie √Ä Deux¬†had its Venice Film Festival debut, and it's about what you would expect from a film festival debut, which is very extreme one way or another. The reality of how good or how bad this film really is will likely become a bit more cohesive when people have some time to really think about it, but for now, this is what we've got, and it's looking pretty damn mixed. That's not entirely surprising considering what a big creative swing this is, and when you take big creative swings, you have a chance of alienating members of your audience. The problem comes when you have a massive budget north of $100 million to make back, but director Todd Phillips doesn't want anyone to talk about that. So, until then, we have some new posters along with a clip that made its way onto social media for all to see.
