A new Joker 2 clip is out, previewing the unconventional romance between Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker and Lady Gaga’s Harley Quinn in the upcoming DC sequel. 
The new clip sees Quinn visiting Arthur Fleck as he’s being held in jail. The two kiss while Quinn reveals that the crowd outside is “going crazy” for him. He then makes a joke as a cop yells at the pair for kissing.

Joker: Folie á Deux is directed by Todd Phillips, who also directed 2019’s Joker movie. Before that, Phillips primarily directed comedy movies, including 2003’s Old School, 2004’s Starsky & Hutch, 2009’s The Hangover, 2010’s Due Date, 2011’s The Hangover Part II, 2013’s The Hangover Part III, and 2016’s War Dogs.
The first Joker movie was released in October 2019. It was a massive hit for Warner Bros. Pictures, bringing in approximately $1.079 billion at the global box office off an estimated $55 million budget. It was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, with Phoenix winning Best Actor and Hildur Guðnadóttir winning Best Original Score.
Joker was originally intended to be a stand-alone film; however, Phillips announced in June 2022 that a sequel was officially happening. Joker: Folie á Deux is set in a different continuity than James Gunn and Peter Safran’s forthcoming DC Universe, which officially kicks off this coming December with an animated Creature Commandos series.
The screenplay for Joker 2 was co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, both of whom also wrote the first film.
