A clip of Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix having an awkward conversation at the premiere of Joker: Folie A Deux during the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in Italy, has gone viral with more than 5 million views on X, after its upload this Monday (October 7).
The video, which claims to be an accurate lip-reading of an exchange between the actors after the film‚Äôs showing on September 4, 2024, left fans feeling pity for Phoenix. According to the subtitles, the lead actor was disappointed and angry at the production.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs horrible!‚Äù Phoenix supposedly said to Gaga, who tries to reassure him that it‚Äôs not before he reiterates. ‚ÄúI do think so.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat? What are you talking about?‚Äù she asked and while Joaquin‚Äôs lips are not easily visible, the singer‚Äôs are and appear to coincide with the video‚Äôs interpretation.

The two then seemingly get into a short argument as Phoenix supposedly states that the ending ‚Äúcould‚Äôve been different,‚Äù an idea that Gaga rejects, stating that she loved it.¬†
‚ÄúOh you did? Yikes,‚Äù the actor said, finishing the exchange with an annoyed look on his face, while turning to receive the congratulations of other members of the audience.

‚ÄúIf in fact this was the real conversation then I do feel really bad for Joaquin and Gaga. She tried to cheer him up but both know what Todd did,‚Äù the post‚Äôs author stated, who also went on to speculate about Warner Brothers and director Todd Phillips blindsiding the actor with a different final cut of the film.
The clip‚Äôs reception was mixed with some viewers doubting the veracity of Joaquin‚Äôs words, and others pointing out how Lady Gaga‚Äôs lips and the overall body language of Phoenix seem to indicate a disagreement between the two.

Todd Phillips‚Äô Joker: Folie √† Deux stumbled at the box office after its release last Friday (October 4), opening with just $37.8 million domestically, far below pre-release expectations of $50 million.

The estimates were already conservative considering the massive success of the first Joker, which shattered box office records in 2019, with a $96.2 million opening domestically.
Critical reception has also been harsh, scoring an aggregate score of 33% among reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 31% among the audience. This is in stark contrast to the first movie, which, while scoring 68% among critics, was able to garner a very positive 89% with audiences.

While professional reviewers praised the film for its originality, most deemed it an ‚Äúunnecessary and pointless‚Äù sequel. Audiences, on the other hand, felt the movie was an attempt at undoing the praise the first one got, and acts as a character regression for Arthur Fleck, Joaquin‚Äôs character in both films.

What, there is a Joker 2? üòÆ
I was overwhelmed with the number of musicals, almost like a Lady Gaga movie than a Joker sequel and the lack of violence was disappointing. The ending was also mediocre.
Sorry, it‚Äôs terrible. Gaga is a fabulous singer, she isn‚Äôt a good actor.
Upvoting you to get you back to zero and also because I absolutely share your opinion
