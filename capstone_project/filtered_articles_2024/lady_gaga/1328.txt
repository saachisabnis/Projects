Warner Bros. released the trailer for the upcoming superhero musical thriller Joker: Folie à Deux. As a sequel to 2019’s Joker, the film continues the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to survive in an asylum as he falls in love with fellow inmate Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga).
Returning director Todd Phillips unveiled the trailer at this year’s CinemaCon and further discussed his vision for the film. During a Q&A session, Phillips was asked about the fact that the film would be a musical, taking a sharp turn from the first film’s grittiness. Phillips explained that he believed that the tones aren’t entirely different since both movies used music to explore Arthur Fleck’s character. “I like to say it’s a movie where music is an essential element,” Phillips explained. “Arthur has music in him. He has a grace to him.”
Though the first film suffered from controversy thanks to its themes regarding male insecurity and fears of sparking violent reprisal, the first film was still a financial success. It also helped Joaquin Phoenix earn an Oscar for Best Lead Actor for portraying this version of the Joker. In the trailer presentation, Phillips thanked theater owners for running the film despite these controversies. Whether or not this film will generate the same amount of controversy remains to be seen.
Joker: Folie À Deux will dance down to theaters on October 4th, 2024.
