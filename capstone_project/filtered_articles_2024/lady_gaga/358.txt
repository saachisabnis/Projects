‘It’s invasive and irresponsible to to comment on a woman’s body’
Honestly, it’s bizarre how every time Lady Gaga seems to be building up to a new album release rumours that she’s pregnant come with it. Gaga famously tweeted “Rumours I’m pregnant? Yeah, I’m pregnant with LG6” before Chromatica, and now she is facing a whole new batch of rumours as the internet bizarrely scrutinises her body. I was looking through Reddit this week and din’t have to scroll for long before I saw pictures of Lady Gaga taken without her consent, discussing her torso, speculating on her pregnancy. Taylor Swift has now weighed in trying to shut up the weirder corners of the internet after the speculation on whether Lady Gaga is pregnant showed no signs of stopping, and Lady Gaga herself had to make a video addressing it.

Lady Gaga posted on her official TikTok that she’s not pregnant, instead encouraging people instead to go and register to vote and do something useful with their lives rather than debate her personal life and weight. She also said she’s “down bad crying at the gym”, referencing a popular Taylor Swift song from Taylor’s latest album The Tortured Poets Department.
Taylor Swift then commented on Lady Gaga’s TikTok, saying “Can we all agree that it’s invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body. Gaga doesn’t owe anyone an explanation and neither does any woman.”
