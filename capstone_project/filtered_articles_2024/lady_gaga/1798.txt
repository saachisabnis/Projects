Feel free to add a Lady Gaga song to your TikTok Video! Universal Music Group has come to a new licensing agreement with TikTok. The two companies have been feuding for months over royalties paid to UMG artists on the video platform. The dispute led UMG to pull the music of Drake, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and other artists from TikTok. Yesterday, the companies announced a new licensing agreement that would bring an end to the dispute. Under the new agreement, UMG says its global family of artists, songwriters and labels will return to TikTok.
