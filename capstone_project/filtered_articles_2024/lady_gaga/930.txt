The colossal mess of “Joker Folie a Deux” has crystallized this morning.
The total weekend take for the $200 million spectacle is $40 million. 
This means that no one went to see Joaquin Phoenix reprise his title role from the 2019 original. Lady Gaga fans didn’t materialize either.
This will be the last time we see Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker. The first film was supposed to be a one off anyway, and not part of the DCU. 
“Joker 2” joins Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” as the second gigantic disaster of this fall season. We are experiencing the opposite of “Barbenheimer” now. What do we call it? “MegaDeux”?
The use of Lady Gaga in one musical fantasy number might have been sufficient. But a whole movie? Who ever thought fan boys would want that? Or anyone? 
Well, live and learn. Warner Bros. now has left on the schedule an animated “Lord of the Rings” movie and Robert De Niro in Barry Levinson’s “Alto Knights,” a much anticipated mob film.
Showbiz411 is now in its 13th year of providing breaking and exclusive entertainment news. This is an independent site, unlike the many Hollywood trades that are owned by one company. To continue providing news that takes a fresh look at what's going on in movies, music, theater, etc, advertising is our basis. Reader donations would be greatly appreciated, too. They are just another facet of keeping fact based journalism alive.Thank you
