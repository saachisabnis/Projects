Grace Randolph Beyond The Trailer said that this underperformance at The Box Office could kill Lady Gaga’s Hollywood career. I’m NOT So Over The Top like Grace Randolph Beyond The Trailer but I think she has point. This underperformance at The Box Office could kill a part of her power in Hollywood. This underperformance at The Box Office could kill a part of Joaquin Phoenix’s career too
Am I the only one who thinks this movie isn’t going to flop at the box office?
There are very good reviews from critics; unfortunately, people have only focused on the worst ones because the film hasn’t been “acclaimed” with a 90 on Metacritic! Personally, I remain convinced that this film will succeed and that it won’t be bad, despite some flaws and the musical aspect. Moreover, Gaga is a mega star who brings people to the cinema. Personally, I already have tickets for two showings: a premiere with friends on October 1st and another ticket with other friends on October 2nd. If it’s good, I’ll probably go see it multiple times, and the Little Monsters will do the same. This will help boost the box office. I’m also looking forward to seeing audience reviews. I’m sure it won’t be as heavily criticized. I have a good feeling about it. Really, I remain confident. After all, Joker 1 was supposed to flop, and it turned out to be a real success. We can’t really know until the film is in theaters. wait And see guys 😉

I’m with you. It appears the hive feels the film is going to collapse.
We have such short memories. This is a repeat of what was said prior to #1. Subtle little differences but the same intent.
Bring it on! And kudos to the global community who doesn’t read domestic msm

Gaga having her Selmasongs/I’m Breathless this is beautiful
Madonna collected panned bombs and Razzies her whole career, that never stopped her to be booked.
Tbh apart from Evita her movie career pretty much sucks.

I liked her in Dick Tracy, Desperately Seeking Susan and A League of Their Own along with Evita.
She’s a better actor than singer. Lmao

 Warner Bros betta campaign the hell out for her given they don’t have other acting contenders. 
 And I feel like she’s even in a better position to get a nomination than Phoenix. They really need to push her

People love Dracool too. There’s something about that blood sucking eternal lover of Lucy.

 Et j’ai l’impression qu’elle est même mieux placée que Phoenix pour obtenir une nomination. Ils ont vraiment besoin de la pousser
I have the same feeling 
Have a drink and settle in by the fire. It’ll pass
