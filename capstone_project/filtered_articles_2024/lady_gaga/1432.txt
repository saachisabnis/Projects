YouTuber Nickster used sounds from Lady Gaga, Radiohead and more to recreate the classic
Someone has reproduced Daft Punk's track, 'Face to Face', using modern samples. Watch the video from YouTuber Nickster below.
Daft Punk’s iconic album ‘Discovery’ is a treasure trove of samples, some more obvious than others. One of the tracks – 'Face to Face’ – featuring the vocals of garage legend Todd Edwards, includes more obscure, micro-samples that make up the cut-up and catchy chorus.
YouTuber Nickster decided to re-create the track, but instead of using samples from the '70s and '80s, as Daft Punk likely did back in the late '90s, he enlisted the help of more modern albums and artists including Radiohead, Carly Rae Jepsen, LCD Soundsystem, Kelly Clarkson and Lady Gaga. 
The result is a masterclass is sample chopping that also highlights the lengths to which Daft Punk went in the original track to create a new melody from old snippets. Nickstar also provided the Ableton session with all of the samples inside for other producers and music makers to see how he stitched it together and to play around with their own versions of ‘Face to Face’.

Earlier this week, it was revealed that Daft Punk's 'Random Access Memories' is the most collected album on Dicsogs, appearing in more than 68,000 collections. An unreleased 2018 Daft Punk album may soon see the light of day, according to a former session drummer.
