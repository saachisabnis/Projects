Ariana Grande coming for Album Of The Year. We did not expect that! The album has hits, there is a story behind this, this is a self-written tracklist, there is VERY short credits list and she’ll be on spotlight for a long time because of Wicked. She’s coming. 
That’s definitely NOT happening. The first single barely did well after the first week, and the first week sales of the album is looking like a chop. Ariana is not a real contender. We have to be a bit realistic here.
~200k (projection increasing day by day, mind you) is “a chop” now? come on…
Ok, AVERAGE. Might barely outdo Pink Friday 2.
There will be even bigger bows this year, so yeah. Ariana won’t be a threat for AOTY. Sorry.
I think the only path Ariana would have for an AOTY victory is a dead year for PVA contenders. We know that winning that category can easily serve as a winning path for AOTY when the competition is weak for the pop vote (see Harry and Taylor). That said, I suspect Taylor and Billie (assuming the latter releases) will be strong enough. So I don’t really buy Ariana.
Her best shot at a Grammy is a PVA win, which I do think is possible, or wins for Pop Dance/Pop Solo. 
Yeah, Happier Than Ever didn’t happen, but “Everything I Wanted” happened the year before that, and that’s apart of that album. 
And What Was I Made For happened too. Not only at the Grammys, she just won her second Oscar. This girl has a bad timing releasing albums after successes with a side project. The voters can feel she’s overawarded, just like in 2022. If the album is a big cultural moment then she’s probably winning, but she won’t win only because “voters like her”. This doesn’t work anymore. We saw this with Adele and we saw this with Billie herself.
I don’t think an Ariana nomination is as unlikely as I previously said because as someone earlier pointed out, this has a lot more passion than Positions. A win on the other hand is NOT happening. Pop albums that win are the by far the biggest accessible album there and there’s going to a bigger album that’s just as accessible nominated.

I’m still not calling a Beyoncé win until I see how well Billie does this era, and I’m most definitely not even acknowledging Ariana’s chances in AOTY – she is just always someone that will be a bridesmaid (mainly in the general field) because there is someone with bigger passion than her. Be realistic. Let’s stick to her Pop chances instead. As for Beyoncé, we always call her THE frontrunner, but she still loses. 
I don’t think The Tortured Poets Department will be much of a factor to win awards, to be honest. It’s extremely rare for artists to win back-to-back, especially with pop voters. The sound is also supposed to be closer to Folklore than her poppy stuff, and we know they didn’t particularly care that much for that.

yeah, me too! And I’m hoping for a folklore/evermore and RED (the deepcuts) type of vibe to it.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
Dolly Parton reveals she cleared the sample of her 1974 classic ‘Jolene’ and hints it may be on Beyonce’s upcoming album in a new interview:
“Well, I think she has! I think she’s recorded ‘Jolene’ and I think it’s probably gonna be on her country album, which I’m very excited about that.”
 It’s 50/50. I think voters will have it top of mind though. 
I think they do not and if they do they also have that she is the most awarded artist too.
jay z has been shut out many times I’m not sure why people think he has this power with the voting pool.
Beyonce is going to have a gift and a curse. She will have votes across genres but will also have splits across genres and will have to rely on others splits to help her out.

If people actually like this album, it can win. It’s not winning if it’s a Midnights situation where no one actually thinks it’s her best album though.

I’m getting reputation/evermore vibes from this one. Speak Now is the only post-AOTY era in Taylor’s catalogue that managed to win any Grammys, albeit only for Mean.
BPVA will definitely have a repeated winner again, but only Adele has managed to pull two consecutive wins. Three wins would be unprecedented. Next year’s winner is likely going to be Ariana or Billie. Hoping it’s Ariana because this is going to be her 6th nomination and Billie can easily win anytime.
Kelly and Ariana deserve to sit in the two-time table with Adele & Taylor for a few years.
I don’t see Gaga and Timberlake as threats yet and it’s too soon for Dua.

Taylor should focus on ROTY with her collab with Posty especially we didn’t have a collab or duo winning ROTY since Silk Sonic two years ago.
There were 5 collab or duo winners that won ROTY a decade ago: Kings of Leon, Lady Antebellum, Gotye ft Kimbra, Daft Punk ft Pharrell Williams, and Mark Ronson ft Bruno Mars.

TTPD will be an album with extremely deep lyrics, stories poetically created by Taylor Swift.#TS11 will be part of an alternative trinity started by folklore/evermore (indie rock, folk rock, indie folk, country, soft rock style) but a greater tendency towards Pop than those. https://t.co/xEUboO4ofN
