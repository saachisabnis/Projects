The first-ever holiday edition of Carpool Karaoke, A Carpool Karaoke Christmas, is now streaming on AppleTV+ and on Apple Music — but the show looks a little different this time. 
First of all, instead of James Corden behind the wheel, it’s Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. And he “picks up” his guests in three cities: Lady Gaga in LA, Dua Lipa in Tokyo and Chappell Roan in her Missouri hometown.
During the show, the guest sings holiday favorites like “Last Christmas,” “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” “Sleigh Ride” and, in Gaga’s case, her own 2008 holiday song, “Christmas Tree.” In addition, Gaga is seen recording a rocking new version of “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,” which you can stream now on all platforms. Dua also serenades Zane with Whitney Houston‘s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.”
You’ll also see all three women sing their hits: Gaga sings “Disease” and “Die With a Smile,” Dua sings “New Rules” and “Houdini,” and Chappell sings “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club.”
According to People, you’ll also get to meet Chappell’s parents, Kara and Dwight Amstutz, as well as their family’s chicken, who’s named Lady Gaga. You can’t make this stuff up.
This is the first episode of Carpool Karaoke to debut in 18 months.
