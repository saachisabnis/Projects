Lady Gaga seems to be taking her roh-mah-roh-mah-mahnce to the next level. The pop star appeared to call longtime boyfriend Michael Polansky her “fiancé” while introducing him to French prime minister Gabriel Attal at the Olympics, in a TikTok posted by Attal himself. If she’s out telling government officials in the City of Love, it’s probably official. Gaga confirmed her relationship with Polansky, a tech entrepreneur and philanthropist, in early 2020 — a revelation that prompted Polansky’s normie ex to write a full New York Times op-ed about the situation. We’ll be awaiting her comment on the happy couple’s engagement.
Thank you Lady Gaga for your stunning performance at the opening ceremony.  It was breathtaking. 🤩🫶
Their engagement only adds to Gaga’s busy year — which includes not only helping open the Olympics, but also starring in Joker: Folie à Deux and releasing her seventh album. She confirmed that new music’s existence in Paris, when she played a few impromptu snippets for fans. Maybe LG7 will hold more clues about their stupid love?
