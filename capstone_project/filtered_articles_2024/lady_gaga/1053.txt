Ever since the release of Fortnite’s Guitar Hero-esque Festival mode, we have seen an increasing number of musical artists added into the game. Following the likes of Eminem and Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish is set to drop onto the battlefield.
As shared by Eilish herself on Twitter, the international superstar announced that she will be headlining Fortnite’s Festival mode from today, the 23rd of April.
What this means is that Billie Eilish is getting the full Fortnite treatment, with available skins, songs and even a dedicated battle pass. Of course, many of the artist’s songs will be added to the game, including:

Therefore I Am
All The Good Girls Go To Hell
Happier Than Ever
Oxytocin


While it may have been somewhat odd initially to see the likes of Spider-Man, Kratos, Lady Gaga and more take up arms, by now it has become just a normal part of Fortnite’s MO. The skin does admittedly look quite cool at least.
