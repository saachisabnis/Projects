Home    Forums    Movies    Lady Gaga Movies Thread
In what World? The memes and general conversation online by DC and movie fans is that they hate it because it’s a musical. It’s a musical because of Lady Gaga. I’ve seen countless memes making fun of her in the movie by large Facebook and X movie accounts. Moviegoers don’t like her at this moment and consider her a franchise killer. Only in gagadaily She’s “praised”
.this will hurt her severely
You must really hate Gaga… it’s cute!
Stating facts isn’t hate

It’s not a fact! I  have seen reviews hating the musical numbers. I have seen them hating the script, and plot. But a good majority of them say that despite the problem in the writing and plots Phoenix and Gaga still give great performances and that is a fact… Hate all you want. Do I think They are getting Oscar nods, I dont! But they aren’t the reason this movie is bad!
Get off gagadaily, sweetie . Moviegoers HATE her character and her.

I dont care about movie goers… they aren’t Oscar, globe, critics choice, bafta, or Sag Voters. The critics don’t feel the same way about Gaga and that’s a fact. 
You should care as a Gaga stan. No audience=no more movies.

99% of Gaga fans want her to focus on music. We will be so fine. She has the biggest song in the world right now.

Did I say she was, but I tend to listen to their opinions and critiques when it comes to talking about awards. I’m also a SAG voter not saying I’m voting for Gaga but I loved her performance and know many others in SAG that loved it too. That was simply my point.

Correct, her music is iconic. But when people try to say mother can’t act it’s baffling.
She can’t really sing either…..

so if She’s not nominated that means She’s shit in that movie. Right?
 He’s annoying and a complete incel, but he might not be as bad as wattsgold, both of them are for sure top 2 though. 
 Don’t forget Vicki Leekx. Wattsgold and Ridley Scott are even better because they don’t hide their hatred towards Gaga. They’re very vocal about it. Vicki Leekx on the other hand doesn’t like posting, but she goes about liking any post that’s hating on Gaga. But they just make me laugh 😂
