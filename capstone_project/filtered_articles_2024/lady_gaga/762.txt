Rob Madge's solo show will play a 16-week run on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre.
Broadway's upcoming solo extravaganza My Son’s A Queer (But What Can You Do?), written by Rob Madge, has partnered with Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation. The partnership will feature activations within the Lyceum Theatre and throughout the online sphere. 
A special focus of the partnership will be supporting the Be There Certificate, a free, self-paced, interactive online mental health course that teaches young people how to support someone struggling with their mental health. 
The partnership will also support Channel Kindness, Born This Way Foundation’s digital platform that invites young people and youth advocates to put compassion into action through community engagement and storytelling. There will also be multiple fundraising initiatives throughout the production's run to support the Born This Way Foundation.
Born This Way Foundation is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2012 by Lady Gaga and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta, to support youth mental health and work with young people to build a kinder and braver world. From its inception, Born This Way Foundation has been youth-led and youth-focused with the goal of meeting and supporting young people where they are.

With previews beginning February 27 and opening night set for March 12, My Son’s A Queer (But What Can You Do?) centers on Rob Madge (Oliver!, Les Misérables) at age 12 as they attempt to create a full scale Disney parade in their house for their grandmother.
Directed by Luke Sheppard (& Juliet), the work premiered at London's Turbine Theatre in 2021 before becoming a sell-out at the 2022 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. West End bows followed in 2022 and 2023, earning a 2023 Olivier nomination. A cast recording was released in 2022. The play is one of several Edinburgh Fringe favorites to have crossed the pond in recent years, including the Tony-winning SIX, The Shark is Broken, and Alex Edelman's one-man show Just For Us.
My Son's a Queer features songs by Pippa Cleary (The Great British Bake Off Musical), scenic and costume design by Ryan Dawson Laight, lighting design by Jai Morjaria, sound design by Tingying Dong, video design by George Reeve, and orchestrations by Simon Nathan. The Broadway production will be produced by arrangement with Bill Kenwright and Paul Taylor Mills.
