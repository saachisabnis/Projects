Mother is back!
Lady Gaga posted a photo on Instagram of what seems to be a schedule of important dates for the next two months. At the bottom of the page there are two important dates listed - one is for the release date of "Joker: Folie a Deux," which she will be playing Harley Quinn. The second is for her first single off her upcoming album "LG7" but there are 2 "x's" in place of the date.ðŸ¤”
The release date for the film is on October 4th so we can assume her new single will be out after the release of the film. All we know is we cannot wait for some new Gaga! What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?!
