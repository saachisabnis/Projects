Lady Gaga finally released the concert film of her Chromatica Ball tour on May 25, and while the biggest takeaway was the promise of new music on the way, there was something else of note: the number of times she told the audience to put their hands up. The trend quickly emerged when she made the request three times during her first song. Had viewers made a drinking game out of it, tragedy would have struck. In fact, she told the audience to put their hands and/or paws in the air so many times that you might have begun to wonder if they weren’t listening…as if they couldn’t hear her. But shots of the audience confirmed that Mother Monster’s mic was working, and they were following her instruction…all of them. But just how many times did Lady Gaga tell the crowd to put their hands up during her HBO concert film? Exactly 45 times over the course of the 1 hour and 52 minute film. Here’s a thorough breakdown of each command and which songs they were delivered during.
