Kamala Harris paid Oprah Winfrey $1million to help her failed presidential bid that cost a whopping $1.2billion.
Winfrey‚Äôs Harpo Productions received $1million from the Harris campaign on October 15 after Winfrey hosted a star-studded town hall event for the Vice President in September, the Washington Examiner reports.
Winfrey also participated in the Democrat‚Äôs last campaign rally in Philadelphia on the night before Election Day, alongside celebrities like Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and Katy Perry, who publicly endorsed Harris.

Well, someone got $1million. Either that or they are lying on their campaign expense forms. We know that would be a very, very bad thing.

What about ‚Äúin kind‚Äù or secret numbered accounts used by other Dem money launderers like Hunter and Joe?
