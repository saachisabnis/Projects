Warner Bros. Pictures has released a new trailer, this one set to a new rendition of “That’s Life” by the film’s stars Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, for filmmaker Todd Phillips’ highly anticipated “Joker: Folie a Deux”.
The R-rated 2019 “Joker” grossed $1 billion and scored Joaquin Phoenix the best actor Oscar. Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck in a story that will reportedly unfold almost entirely within Gotham City’s Arkham Asylum and will have musical elements.
In the film, Arthur is incarcerated in Arkham where he meets Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga). The two fall madly in love and experience musical madness through their shared delusions.
Meanwhile Fleck’s followers start a movement to free him from Arkham, ultimately giving rise to the Clown Prince of Crime’s criminal empire.
Zazie Beetz, Catherine Keener, Brendan Gleeson, and Jacob Lofland co-star in the movie which Phillips once again directs from a script he wrote with Scott Silver.
The project is considered a DC Elseworlds project, thus is not part of the Peter Safran and James Gunn DC Universe. “Joker: Folie a Deux” is slated to premiere in cinemas everywhere on October 4th.
