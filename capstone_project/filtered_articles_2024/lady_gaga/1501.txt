Many celebrities have shared some spooky supernatural stories based on their encounters with the paranormal.
Succession star Sarah Snook said she spotted a ghost in London’s Theatre Royal Haymarket while performing Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray in 2024.
“I do feel like I saw one. I saw somebody get up, and I was, like, ‘Oh, cool. They’re getting up and leaving. They must need to go to the toilet.’ But I look back and they were not there,” she told The New Yorker in an interview published in March 2025. “They were in a very white, kind of Victorian play-dress, a big floofy white dress and a bow. I did ask the people who run the theatre, and they said that it’s haunted, but they’ve never seen that ghost.”
And breakout country star Dasha, whose song “Austin” went viral on TikTok earlier this year, claims she not only had a brush with a ghostly apparition – she actually grew up with a spirit in her house.
Speaking to “Taste of Country Mornings with Wood and Nicole” in July 2024, the singer explained that her family once rented a “super haunted house,” which bore a tragic history.
“This family had died like 200 years ago when it was built of, like, some crazy fever, and this little girl had died in my room and I had no idea,” she related.

Although Dasha herself never saw the child’s ghost, her stepsister reportedly did, describing her as wearing “a white nightgown” and sitting on Dasha’s bed. She even claimed the little girl turned and looked at her.
Luckily for Dasha, her stepsister did not reveal this spooky information until the family moved out. “Thank God,” noted Dasha. “Or else I never would have stepped foot in that room!”

Snook said she not only saw a ghost in the audience at the theater she was performing Dorian Gray in, she sensed the spirit of author Wilde all around her in London. 
“I will say this: when we moved into our apartment in London it was very f---ing cold, so we went out quickly to get beanies and gloves, a scarf. When we came back, the lights were going [makes flashing gesture] and the heaters were going up to twenty-nine and down to three and up and down, up and down. And then everything went out. We went downstairs, and there’s a gunpowder smell — and my stepson was, like, ‘Gunpowder! That means there’s a ghost!’ The fuse box had blown in the basement,” she told The New Yorker.
“We had to go to Brown’s Hotel, and our room was directly opposite the Albemarle Club, where Oscar Wilde had been, which was the beginning of the end of him, where he was accused of being a sodomite by the Marquess of Queensbury. The argument happened on the steps which we could see from our window.”
When asked if she had a stage-management ghost, Snook said, “I call it the benevolent haunting.”

The Phantom of the Opera composer recalled a time when he had to enlist the help of the church to remove a spirit from his home. 
“I did have a house in Eaton Square which had a poltergeist,” Webber said in a January 2024 interview with the Telegraph. “It would do things like take theater scripts and put them in a neat pile in some obscure room. In the end, we had to get a priest to come and bless it, and it left.”

The Star Trek star told USA Today in October 2023 that he’s been “witnessing stuff since I was 12 years old,” including living in a haunted house in Los Angeles.
Per the outlet, he detailed the encounter in his Making It So memoir. “I moved out like a shot and immediately felt much safer in my new home,” he wrote, noting his son Daniel was the first to witness paranormal activity in the residence. Stewart’s home buyers then asked why he abruptly moved out, so he confessed the ghost appearance.
“To my relief, I never heard anything from my buyers afterward," he added before explaining that he did see the individuals who sold him the property again. “When I went over to greet them, they were clearly uncomfortable and beat a retreat from me almost immediately. I got the distinct impression that they had something to hide."

"I don't know what it is about me or my brothers but we attract ghosts," the DNCE frontman said during a November 2022 appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden. "I lived in a haunted house with a few roommates back in the day here in Los Angeles." He said that during his tenure, police would show up at the door claiming they'd gotten calls from the house asking for help. When he and his roommates checked the landline, the phone was unplugged. "Just creepy things like that," he recalled. "After we moved out, Olivia Wilde moved in. She bought the house ... they moved out pretty quick too."

“I’ve accepted the fact that I see things and I hear things,” the Tick, Tick… Boom! actress claimed during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in April 2022, noting that she’s had “a lot” of paranormal encounters over the years. “I kind of shut it down for a while [because] the unknown is scary. But I recently was like, ‘No, this is a gift and something that I have the ability to do, so I’m going to lean into it.’”
Hudgens even completed her “first real paranormal investigation” ahead of the interview, where she met a playful ghost while visiting a cemetery.
“We found this one tombstone of a spirit that we were told is very playful,” she said. “So, I turn on [the spirit box] and I said, ‘Hi Sam, I’m Vanessa [and] this is Gigi’ … And then Gigi goes, ‘Sam, can you tell us our names?’ Then we just hear ‘Vanessa’ [she makes static sounds] ‘Gigi.’ I was like, ‘Cool, do you have anything else that you want to tell me?’

The Friends alum recalled in March 2022 a scary experience with a ghost that led her to selling her house.“I didn’t believe at first. But I lived in this house in Laurel Canyon, which is in L.A., obviously, and it was Gypsy Rose Lee’s house and Carole King,” Cox said during an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “So, Carole King came over to my house, and she said that there had been a divorce that was really ugly, and there was a ghost in the house. And I was, like, ‘Yeah, whatever.’ But other people who would stay there with me, like friends of mine, said they felt an encounter with a woman who was sitting on the edge of the bed.”The Shining Vale star noted that after doing a seance with King she still didn’t really believe in the supernatural, but that changed when a random UPS worker came to her home.“I was at the house one day not being a believer. The doorbell rang. It was a UPS guy, or something, and I opened the door and he said, ‘Do you know this house is haunted?’” Cox continued. “And I go, ‘Yeah, why? Why do you think that?’ And he goes, ‘Because there is someone standing behind you.’ And I was like, ‘Let’s sell.’”The Scream actress listed the home soon thereafter, adding, “I couldn’t sleep there alone ever again.”

During a December 2021 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Oscar winner claimed that her house is haunted by the ghost of a late movie star. “I grew up watching Westerns and I bought this house, and it was owned by a guy who did Westerns, so I must have been a fan of his,” she told the comedian. “I think he is my protector. I love him because he kind of sorts out the bad people that shouldn’t be there. He runs them out."
The Ma actress said that visitors sometimes don't want to come back after staying with her, but she sees it as a test. “That’s how I know that they don’t belong there, because if you’re a person that belongs there, everybody is like, ‘Oh, your place is so welcoming, it’s so great,'" she explained.
Spencer joked that the spectral presence gets upset when she's away from the home. “When I leave for a long time, he’s a little shady. The doors close, the lights go off when I turn them on," she continued. “I love my ghost. I just don’t want you bringing your ghost to my house. I don’t want anybody’s ghost thinking they can be friends with my ghost. Because my ghost can haunt me, but he doesn’t haunt me. We have boundaries.”

The Eternals actress revealed in November 2021 that she had a lot of unexplained things happening in her London home — including the piano playing by itself and lights going on and off — which led her to calling in a professional to rid the house of ghosts.
“I get it the worst … I’ve seen the actual things,” Hayek’s daughter, Valentina, said during an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show while her mom was chatting with Ellen DeGeneres on stage. Hayek explained that although she didn’t see any ghosts, she did call in help. 
“[They] found like 20 [ghosts],” the House of Gucci actress said, recalling the man seeing an “old lady and a child” spirit. There was also a nun ghost, according to Hayek, who claimed there are only two supernatural entities remaining in the home.

That night, he heard some strange noises including "a sound like a dime dropping from 10 feet off the ground onto a glass table." The actor ran "buck naked" but couldn't find the culprit.

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum told the San Francisco Gate in 2003: "I have a ghost in my house… I don't think he died there because there's a law in L.A. that when you buy a house, if somebody's died there, they have to disclose that."
Still, reasoned the actress, "He's very friendly. My friend saw him first one night. She said, 'I don't mean to alarm you but I just saw a man follow us out of the house.' And I said, 'Well, at least he's gentlemanly.'"
