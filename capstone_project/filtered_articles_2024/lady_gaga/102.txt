In a world dominated by bloodlines, I got to know two brother combat athletes very well. Dare I say, I was the "wise-man?". One remains in the business, one got out early. Their homeland ties they wear on their sleeve, and they chose very different athletic paths when they got to America. Each had a very understandable reason why. 
I needed to move to a quieter area from where I was, one that wouldn't burn through the little money I had saved. I couldn't afford an apartment, but I was an easy roommate for people. I paid my bills. I was reasonably neat and respectful. An ad through a website showed a place that was in a good location and had enough room for all I had, and then some. It's got trees and rabbits, with public transport. All I have to do is have cash on hand, present like a respectable human being and decide if I like the place or not.
The younger brother answered the phone number listed after some phone-tag, and we agreed on 5:30 that afternoon when I'd check it out. The third house from a relatively busy road, the neighborhood looked quiet and unassuming,much like an old postcard. I knocked on the door three different times without hearing an answer or a peep, but seeing multiple cars in the driveway, someone had to be there. The house was a little weather-beaten from the outside, and the front door was a little flimsy. The home was most definitely lived in.
"If I need to lock my front door, I'm in the wrong business" said the man at the door, a little smaller in size than me. I introduced myself, and he invited me in. A surprisingly vast living room/dining room was unveiled, natural light shining on the titles resting on the couch to my right, The house was old, but it had its charm. Through the many windows, I noticed the surprising size of the backyard. Not knowing him from Adam and trying to feel out where I'm going to live next, I asked him if he did the landscaping himself.
"Women landscape for ME!"
That's all I needed to know. I'm moving in on Thursday.
Turns out I had never really talked to either brother before that moment. Their agent was the one renting out the room in the house, because the transition to America in certain disciplines can be hard and they needed to pay the mortgage. The college kid renting there was flunking out of school, and Mom wasn't floating the note anymore. I had eyes on it, and it was mine. No more hotels. 
Turns out he had been a soldier in his home country, as had his brother. He stood about 5'4", 150, and was told his brother weighed in naturally at 240, and 6'3". Both studied different styles for combat and grew a great acumen for it. These skills were used for defense and competition. I asked questions about the titles just sitting on the top ridge of the couch, and he told stories of each of the five. He seemed happy to talk about combat, anxious for his brother to handle the finances. I asked about the army he was a part of and he intensely described the training over anything else. I knew enough from the industry not to feed a bear. I didn't need any demonstrations.
"Are YOU the guy?" said the larger guy entering through the unlocked front door. No keys. Got it. Smiles from ear to ear on the man, purely the spirit child for the creation of GUNTHER. He was as friendly as he was intimidating. Turns out, we were both musicians. (If ever intimidated, commonality helps you immensely!) Before we started playing "Hotel California"  musically, I learned what that song looked like in their own lives. You can check out any time you want...
There was a dissonance between the brothers, but a friendly one. They were related in blood, but were very different people. "I studied Greco-Roman. I was always bigger," the elder brother said. "I became so good the army noticed. I had to get better. My family depended on it." Over the course of a few weeks, I became his hype man before work. Myself, knowing how to dress and talk, would cut promos for the "Supreme." The guy had natural charisma and good looks, but his English was only good enough in short bursts as a bouncer/"head of security", or for his lady prey that evening. He had more than a passing interest in pursuing pro wrestling, now that his main MMA days were behind him. "I make better money scaring drunk people than I did sober ones," he recalled. "If I was five years younger, it would be the other way around." For a guy who claimed he wasn't very bright, he was pretty perceptive.
The younger brother only stopped training when he slept, ate, or got in my way in the bathroom. I usually had early shifts that paid me and them, and I eat protein, too, so they would defer to me. An old Levitt house could only handle so much, and he had different training and hygiene methods than I did. Myself, a retail service manager who played a damned good guitar, trained differently. Needless to say, the old house couldn't keep all of us together for too long.
" I can't afford to gain weight." said the younger brother. "My only chance is my speed." Early on in his combat tenure, he understood the impression he needed to make. "i've done good. Good enough to be known, but not enough to be noticed." I understood what that felt like, too.
"Amateur wrestling? I can handle 230." said his older, bigger brother. "Fight  combat heavyweight? Brock Lesnar." When we met initially seven years ago, as opposed to now? I can't imagine it would hurt less. "I can't stay that big and be that fast, so I get out." At the time, his thick Eastern European accent was clear as day. He saw his ceiling, realized he had reached it and got out with only mild issues. His younger brother? He didn't accept limits, and fewer would accept his challenges.
"I'm the best they have. All through the COVID nobody wanted to fight me, because they KNEW they couldn't beat me!" No difference in confidence at all. Just the direction. Two brothers. Different directions, with the same goal. Live a comfortable life.
Both brothers fought for their country when they were of age to, according to them . The more gregarious older brother spoke more of what the battles looked like to him as a child. "I don't really know. He went, then I did." It bothered him briefly, and once he took a moment, said, "it was our duty, and it was bull***t." For a guy who didn't speak clear English, I understood completely.
After a half-dozen times hyping him up for being "head of security" at some of the best clubs in town, I asked him what I was missing. "I miss my wife. I have every woman I want, but it's not that." He had retired from active MMA. " I see my brother and his discipline, and I can't afford that."  He chose bouncing over being in the industry, despite looking like a million bucks. "You sound very good, but my body don't." The 32-year old was happier singing whatever that Bradley Cooper and Lagy Gaga song was than fighting. I remember playing a guitar chord progressions and he entered the room with an instrument I had never seen before. "It's from my country. You've never seen?" Three strings, fretted like a guitar in concept, but played very differently. Twelve-bar blues has never sounded the same to me since that day. I was memorized by the surprising musical talent he possessed. "The Supreme Mechanical-Musical Super Athlete" was born.
Training is a lifestyle, just like any other. The younger brother used anything he saw as a device. "I like trees." he told me. "They were here first. I respect that." Every morning, just contemplating his road work was beyond me. " I have a lot of people to please, and I haven't met the next one." As a guitar player, I understood. As an athlete?
"They don't pay a lot, but they pay." It took months to get the silent brother to talk, but he said a lot. "I had three contenders matches, all cancelled." I now understood how I ended up here. This was before the pandemic. There  wasn't a lot of money there. He was a personal trainer on the side to pay his fees, but other things were out of his range,
"He don't talk to me so much." the older brother told me. "He sees money. He's good. I don't see what he sees."
The older brother understood the younger brother, but disagreed. About twenty professional fights into his career, his autograph is worth way more than his bookings. They have a family, and fight as best they can professionally and personally. The natural star walked away, before he was forced.The younger isn't forced, it's just what he does well. He is finally nearing contention for a championship, and his stuff on E-Bay is surprisingly expensive. The elder had no problems walking away, content with his accomplishments. " I fight international competitions," he told me recently. "it pays better, and I win." He was heading to Ohio soon for trials for a Greco-Roman tournament, one he had emerged victorious from three years before. "I break my f**king forearm in final," as he shows me the clip from YouTube. "I wasn't mad. I would do the same thing."
All good things must come to an end, and our time together ended after almost three years. I fell Ill coming out of the pandemic and was no longer able to afford my end of the rent. The landlord was tired of paying high property taxes and saw my health issues at the time as a liability, so we all went our separate ways. The younger brother remains a top combat star for a very well-known organization. The elder still loves The Eagles, a young ladies company, and now has his wife and two children to put him over. They no longer needed a "wise-man," I would think to myself when I see them on social media daily. They were smart enough to do what was right for them. They were brothers in real life, and I was their adopted cousin.
True story, and I have everything that is in my life today to prove it.
