Lady Gaga has released a video for her new single, Disease.
The eerie clip finds the superstar multi-hyphenate playing numerous roles that are battling against eachother. She explained:
"I think a lot about the relationship I have with my own inner demons. It’s never been easy for me to face how I get seduced by chaos and turmoil. It makes me feel claustrophobic.

"Disease is about facing that fear, facing myself and my inner darkness, and realizing that sometimes I can’t win or escape the parts of myself that scare me. That I can try and run from them but they are still part of me and I can run and run but eventually I’ll meet that part of myself again, even if only for a moment.

"Dancing, morphing, running, purging. Again and again, back with myself. This integration is ultimately beautiful to me because it’s mine and I’ve learned to handle it. I am the conductor of my own symphony. I am every actor in the plays that are my art and my life. No matter how scary the question, the answers are inside of me. Essential, inextricable parts of what makes me me. I save myself by keeping going. I am the whole me, I am strong, and I am up for the challenge. Happy Halloween."
The track, which she co-wrote with Andrew Watt, Cirkut and her fiancé Michael Polansky, was released just a few days ago and is the first to be shared from her new album, which is expected in spring 2025. She's been referring to the follow-up to 2020's 'Chromatica' as 'LG7', though it's unclear if that's just a temporary placeholder.
Gaga has also shared a live video for her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, which features them performing at the Dolby Live at Park MGM in Las Vegas. She released the single back in August, and in September put out 'Harlequin', an accompanying album to Joker: Folie à Deux, the musical sequel to 2019's Joker in which she portrays Harleen "Lee" Quinzel alongside Joaquin Phoenix.
