Here are some things to consider:
There haven’t been reports of public displays of affection (PDA) during the dinner. While their behavior suggests they might be more than friends, it’s not definitive proof of a romantic relationship.
Overall, the evidence points towards them having a private dinner together, but the exact nature of their relationship remains unconfirmed.
