NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - The Smoothie King Center was filled to near-capacity on Tuesday night as Bad Bunny, one of the world’s biggest music stars, brought his “Most Wanted Tour” to New Orleans. The Puerto Rican rapper, known for his energetic performances and catchy songs in Spanish, thrilled the crowd with a mix of hits and a special jazz-inspired number, paying homage to the city’s rich musical heritage.
With 17,000 attendees, the arena was buzzing.
“New Orleans looked like Puerto Rico last night!” Fox 8 reporter Andres Fuentes said. “17,000 Latinos all dancing to Bad Bunny”
Bad Bunny’s stage setup was designed to look like a bridge, which was not unique to the New Orleans date, but a coincidental nod to the Crescent City Connection.
Sitting beneath it, Bad Bunny spoke about New Orleans’ rich musical history and how honored he was to perform in the city. He then took a seat at a piano and played a jazz-inspired piece.
