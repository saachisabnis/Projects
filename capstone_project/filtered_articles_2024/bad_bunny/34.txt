This past weekend, Kamala Harris' campaign released a video featuring the well-known musician Marc Anthony. "While some may have forgotten, I remember what it was like when Donald Trump was president," said the New York-born singer of Puerto Rican descent before listing several of Trump's policies against immigrants.
With this statement, Marc Anthony joined a growing list of artists who have decided to break their silence and pick a side in what many see as one of the most crucial U.S. elections.
While big global names like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé have voiced their support, the Latino representation behind Harris, who could become the first female president of the United States, has also been making waves with stars like Cardi B, John Leguizamo, and Eva Longoria.
Trump, on the other hand, hasn't seen the same overwhelming support from the Latino community or artists. However, the former president has managed to attract a handful of Latino celebrities who have publicly endorsed him, despite the potential backlash.
Let's take a closer look at how Latino stars have aligned themselves politically as we approach the 2024 presidential elections.
With his video this weekend, the salsa icon became one of the most prominent figures to publicly back the Democratic candidate. In his one-minute message, the "Vivir Mi Vida" singer stressed Trump's actions and words about Puerto Rico following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria:
"Trump blocked billions in aid while thousands died. I remember when we needed clean water and electricity, Trump threw paper towels and called Puerto Rico 'dirty and poor.'"
His heartfelt message resonated with many celebrities, including former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and actress Eva Longoria, who praised his bravery.
The Mexican-American actress, famous for her role as Gabrielle Solis on Desperate Housewives, has become a political and philanthropic force in recent years, playing a visible role during Barack Obama's presidency.
On Friday, Longoria shared a clip she directed featuring former President Obama, where he passionately made the case for why Kamala Harris should become the next president of the United States.

Best known for his roles in 'Hamilton' and 'In the Heights,' Anthony Ramos has long used his platform to advocate for social justice and minority rights. Recently, he endorsed Harris at a large event in Pennsylvania, where the Democrat faces a fierce battle with Trump that could hinge on the Latino vote.
"We know what we gonna get, if we go the other way." Ramos said to applause. "It's not like it's a surprise... I ate that meal. It was terrible."
At the same event in Pennsylvania, Liza Colón-Zayas, who recently became the first Latina to win an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy for her role in 'The Bear,' spoke out. "Now that I know a bit about making history, I'm here to tell you we can do it again," she said to cheers from the crowd.
Colón-Zayas also took to social media on October 9th, posting a video critiquing Trump with a caption that read, "A quick look at the draft dodging, bankrupting, sexual assaulting, race baiting, defrauding, felony committing, and insurrection inciting creep."
The Dominican-American rapper, known for her global hits and no-filter personality, has been an outspoken figure in U.S. politics. She was among the first celebrities to endorse Kamala Harris, even before Joe Biden stepped aside.
AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate…..STOP FCKIN PLAYIN WITH ME !!!!!!! https://t.co/IAJO5yo79r
Cardi B has defended Harris against what she considers misogynistic attacks. "I always knew how people act toward women, but the disrespect?" she said in a live session on her X account. "Look, if you don't like her politics, fine. But disrespecting her just because she's a woman? That's disgusting."
A cumbia titled 'No Se Equivoque, Compa' has been circulating, thanks to a band called Los Trabajadores del Norte. The catchy song, which aims to spark reflection among Latino voters, warns about the dangers of supporting Trump and positions Harris as the best candidate to defend immigrant and minority rights.
With its direct lyrics addressing racism and Trump's immigration policies, the song is gaining traction on social media, quickly becoming an anthem for those seeking change, particularly among undecided voters and migrants.
Linda Ronstadt, the iconic American singer of Mexican descent, is known for her prolific musical career and activism. In a statement issued on September 11 of this year through her Instagram account, Ronstadt expressed her categorical rejection of Donald Trump and his policies. Specifically, she condemned the separation of migrant families at the border during his administration, calling these actions a "humanitarian catastrophe." Additionally, she voiced her support for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 elections, stating that she will proudly vote for them in November.

Jessica Alba
Jessica Alba, the actress and entrepreneur of Latino descent thanks to her Mexican father, is an active advocate for voting and political participation in the United States. She was one of the first celebrities to join the "Voto con Ganas" campaign, aimed at encouraging Latino voter turnout. Throughout her activism, she has used her social media platforms to motivate her followers to register and vote, emphasizing that voting is the most powerful tool for creating significant societal change. Additionally, Alba has openly expressed her support for Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. In a recent message, she highlighted, "When we don't vote, those in power assume not only that we don't care, but that we are willing to hand over our power to them."

Demi Lovato
Demi Lovato has shown her support for Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. As part of her activism for the LGBTQ+ community and trans rights, Lovato has used her influence to motivate her followers to vote and support progressive causes. While she remains active on social issues, her endorsement of Harris is clear, highlighting her commitment to human rights and equity. This stance is not new for Lovato, who has been vocal in previous elections and continues to promote voting among young people.
Jennifer Lopez, the Puerto Rican-American superstar, is using her platform to inspire her followers to vote in the 2024 elections. As co-chair of 'When We All Vote,' she has worked tirelessly to increase voter turnout, especially within Latino communities. On her social media, JLo shared: "Let's make our voices heard and ensure that every voice is counted in this election." She also participated in the digital town hall organized by Oprah, titled 'United for America,' where she openly endorsed Kamala Harris, emphasizing the importance of having leaders who fight for the rights of women and minorities. Additionally, Lopez has collaborated with Stashrun to raise funds for 'When We All Vote,' encouraging her followers to register and actively participate in the voting process.

America Ferrera
The American actress of Honduran descent, best known for playing Betty in 'Ugly Betty' and empowering women of all ages with her speech in 'Barbie,' has dedicated herself to activism for several years through her foundation, Harness. However, this election season, Ferrera has focused her efforts on supporting Kamala Harris, leading events like the one she headlined on October 8 in Philadelphia. During the event, she reminded a group of Latinas that they hold the power to decide who will win the presidency in November.
While they have not openly endorsed Kamala Harris, more than 20 Mexican artists involved in the 'Ya Estuvo' campaign are encouraging people to vote against Donald Trump, and in a bipartisan system, this is almost equivalent. The campaign is supported by a long list of Mexican artists, including Maná (who also "punished" Nicky Jam for supporting Trump), Los Tigres del Norte, Paquita la del Barrio, Chiquis Rivera, Kate del Castillo, and Alejandro Fernández, who recently had to clarify that his father did not support Trump.
The campaign is accompanied by a video mixing Trump's anti-Mexican migrant statements with real footage of racist attacks on Latinos in the U.S. by citizens echoing the former president's rhetoric.
"Immigrants are our family," reads one point in the video. "Our silence allows them to be attacked." The one-and-a-half-minute clip ends with the phrase "Everyone vote."
Nicky Jam's endorsement of Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Las Vegas caused a seismic shift in the Latino entertainment world, sparking reactions from artists as varied as Maná and Residente of Calle 13, who attributed the reggaeton artist's support to a "lack of information."
However, Nicky Jam remained firm in his stance. "Where I come from, people don't even know the president, so I'm fortunate," he said in a brief statement, adding, "We need you back! We need you to be president again."
Puerto Rican reggaeton artists supported Trump's candidacy during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on August 30. "Since Trump left, we've been through many things as a country," Anuel AA began in his speech, adding that Trump has been "the best president the world has ever seen, the best the country has ever seen." The singer also praised the former president in a recent Instagram post, encouraging his followers to vote.

"Everyone vote for Donald Trump. My Latino and Hispanic brothers, let's stay united like the family we are and vote for the good and safety of our country, which is our home."
For his part, Quiles expressed in Pennsylvania that he likes Trump because "he's not a puppet" and that he is "the most honest president we've ever had," ideas he reiterated in a post dedicated to the president with a caption that read: "I prefer a president who is hated for telling it like it is over one who is loved for lying to our faces."

In recent years, actress and singer Paty Navidad has made headlines not only for her talent on screen but also for the controversies surrounding her off-screen opinions. The Mexican star has made a habit of expressing controversial views on topics such as COVID-19, which she claimed was nothing more than a simple mutation of the flu that could only be addressed with a strong immune system, and the infamous January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, an event in which she supported the attackers.
Given her history, it comes as no surprise that Navidad is a staunch supporter of President Trump, despite not voting in the United States. "He is the best option for the world, for Latin America, for Mexico, and obviously for the United States," Navidad has said in the past.
The actor, producer, and musician who rose to fame in the 90s as a member of the pop group 'Kairo' has shown his admiration for the Republican candidate for several years. However, in September of this year, his support reached a new level when he released a rap composed of just three phrases: "Latinos with Trump," "Trump again," and "Make America Great Again."
Along with the single, which he shared on his social media, Verástegui also released a video showing him in a recording studio, wearing a cap with the inscription "Freedom Fighters '24." The video ends with the actor looking into the camera and saying, "I'm Eduardo Verástegui, and Latinos are with Trump," despite the fact that he doesn't vote in the United States.

On Tuesday, an event sponsored by 'Latino Americans for Trump' and led by Florida Governor Rick Scott took place at the Trump National Hotel in Doral, Florida. The event, which featured Donald Trump himself and began with the song 'God Bless America', made waves on social media early on, thanks to the presence of a guest who surprised many: Venezuelan singer, Nacho.
A post shared by instagram
Widely known for his role in the successful duo Chyno y Nacho, the musician has not shied away from expressing his political views in the past, advocating for political change in his home country of Venezuela for years. However, this marks the first time he has publicly shared his stance on U.S. elections. It's important to note that 'La Criatura', as he is affectionately known in the industry, does not vote in the United States.
There is little doubt that an endorsement from the Puerto Rican artist would be crucial for any candidate running for the U.S. presidency. However, Bad Bunny has chosen to stay neutral when it comes to offering an official endorsement. "I know politics is a mess, nobody believes in the country's politicians," the Puerto Rican musician said on El Tony's podcast on September 2.
Nevertheless, Bad Bunny has made efforts to encourage his fellow citizens to vote, focusing on a cause close to his heart. At the end of September, he rented several billboards to criticize the ruling New Progressive Party, which advocates for Puerto Rico to become a state of the United States. "I'm not getting involved in politics, politics gets involved in my life because it affects my country, because it affects Puerto Rico," he said during the El Tony interview.
The Venezuelan-American actor, who rose to fame for his memorable role as Fez in 'That 70s Show,' was responsible for producing and directing the 'Vota con Ganas' campaign for the Voto Latino Foundation in early October. This initiative aims to encourage more than 36 million eligible Latinos to vote in the elections. The Miami-born actor emphasized the importance of motivating Latino voters to "take a seat at the table where important decisions about our country and its future are made."
Although the campaign features several celebrities who have openly supported Harris, such as Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, and America Ferrera, Valderrama has so far chosen not to endorse any candidate.
