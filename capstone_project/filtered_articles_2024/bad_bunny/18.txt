	The latest person to join the cast of Adam Sandler’s upcoming Happy Gilmore sequel is Mr. Rager himself: Kid Cudi.

	As announced Friday (Oct. 25) by Deadline, the rapper is officially set to appear in the Netflix follow-up to the 1996 cult-classic film, which stars Sandler in the title role as an amateur golfer. Details of Cudi’s character — and the film’s plot — are still unknown.

	Sharing the news on Instagram, the musician wrote, “Ive been wanting to talk about this for a minute!!!”

	“This is so f—in HUGE,” he continued. “Its been a long time dream of mine to work w Adam, hes my favorite, and his movies and comedy made up my childhood. Another dream come true. BLESSED!! Get ready, this ones gonna be EPIC.”

	Born Scott Mescudi, the “Day ‘N’ Nite” artist has previously acted in Silent Night, X, Don’t Look Up and more. In 2024, he appeared in M. Night Shyamalan’s Trap and Paramount+’s Knuckles.

	Cudi is already in good company with the Happy Gilmore 2 cast, which will see Sandler reprise his role alongside original stars Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald. As previously confirmed, Travis Kelce and Bad Bunny will also make cameos in the project.

	The news comes about 10 months after the release of Cudi’s most recent album, Insano, which bowed at No. 13 on the Billboard 200. Earlier this week, he dropped “The Moon Man Survives,” the latest installment of his The Soundtrack of Moon Man project, which coincides with his Moon Man comic series.
