From Olivia Rodrigo to the Rolling Stones, here are the most anticipated shows and festivals of the year.
Lester Fabian Brathwaite is a staff writer at Entertainment Weekly, where he covers breaking news, all things Real Housewives, and a rich cornucopia of popular culture. Formerly a senior editor at Out magazine, his work has appeared on NewNowNext, Queerty, Rolling Stone, and The New Yorker. He was also the first author signed to Phoebe Robinson's Tiny Reparations imprint. He met Oprah once.
 2023 was a banner year for music, with Taylor Swift and Beyoncé leading the charge and shattering box office records with their respective world tours (one of which is still chugging along).

 This year promises its own crop of superstar treks. In addition to Swift's Eras Tour, Nicki Minaj, Bad Bunny, Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, and the Rolling Stones are all hitting the road. Plus, the Eagles have their farewell tour and Madonna continues to stir up controversy with her Celebration Tour.

 Here, we present our roundup of the concerts and music festivals hitting North America in 2024 that you won't want to miss. Keep checking back as we update the lineup throughout the year.
