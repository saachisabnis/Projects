Bling, bling! Starting May 9, the American Museum of Natural History is hosting Ice Cold: An Exhibition of Hip-Hop Jewelry.
This special exhibition will celebrate hip-hop’s cultural influence through custom jewelry from stars such as Slick Rick, A$AP Rocky, Nicki Minaj, The Notorious B.I.G., Bad Bunny, Erykah Badu, and many more.
“Throughout the Museum, you’ll see objects that open a window onto our shared past or our current world, whether that’s nature, science, or culture. In Ice Cold, the objects are magnificent jewelry pieces and the window opens into one of the most powerful social and cultural forces of the past 50 years, Hip Hop,” said Sean M. Decatur, President of the American Museum of Natural History. “We’re pleased to showcase these iconic pieces and the cultural phenomenon of Hip Hop, thereby reminding our visitors that culture is not just long ago or far away, but a part of all of our lives that we can reflect on and celebrate.”

Ice Cold: An Exhibition of Hip-Hop Jewelry opens at the American Museum of Natural History on May 9, in the Melissa and Keith Meister Gallery, part of the Allison and Roberto Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals.
“Bringing the Ice Cold exhibit to the American Museum of Natural History is a testament to the cultural significance of this art form and culture,” said Ice Cold guest curator Vikki Tobak. “It’s time to celebrate the artists, jewelers, craftsmen, and everyday people who contributed to the storied history of hip-hop jewelry. This exhibit not only pays homage to hip-hop’s roots with pieces from Biz Markie and Jam Master Jay for example but also highlights its enduring impact on style and society with pieces from contemporary artists like Tyler, the Creator, A$AP Rocky, and FERG.”






This new exhibit chronicles the evolution of jewelry in hip-hop over the past five decades, ranging from oversized gold chains from the 1970s to the 1990s to today. These pieces showcased in the exhibit, which builds upon New York City’s 50th anniversary of hip-hop, demonstrate how the decorative art form has served as a canvas for stories of resilience, rebellion, and creative self-expression.
Among the pieces highlighted in the exhibit include glittering crown, eye-patch, and a 5-foot-long chain from Slick Rick; Nas’ diamond-encrusted ‘QB’ pendant; a diamond-studded Roc-A-Fella medallion made in honor of the record label co-founded by Jay-Z; a multi-colored, fully-articulated LEGO minifigure pendant commissioned by A$AP Rocky; T-Pain’s “Big Ass Chain” and one of Nicki Minaj’s “Barbie” pendants.
Nicki Minaj’s iconic Barbie pendant—which boasts 54.47 carats of diamonds on 18-karat gold and bright Barbie-pink enamel—was made by Ashna Mehta in 2022 and is the most recent commissioned by Minaj, whose first Barbie pendant dates to 2009.Alvaro Keding/© AMNH
“This moment celebrates the creativity and innovation of hip-hop,” said Ice Cold guest co-curator Karam Gill, creative director and filmmaker behind the 2021 documentary series ICE COLD. “From the docuseries to the book, the Ice Cold project has shed light on larger conversations around societal perception and the American Dream. This exhibition pushes that further in a powerful way.”
“Ice Cold will truly spark a sense of excitement and curiosity into our world of jewelry and baubles as an extended form of hip-hop culture, which has inspired the global stage as an extension of our art,” said hip-hop icon and Ice Cold senior advisor Ricky “Slick Rick” Waters. “This collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History is a harmonious blend of creativity and cultural significance. I’m very honored to be a part of creating a unique and immersive experience for the Museum’s visitors in such a renowned space in the mecca of New York City.”
Ice Cold: An Exhibition of Hip-Hop Jewelry will be on display in the Melissa and Keith Meister Gallery through Jan. 5, 2025.
