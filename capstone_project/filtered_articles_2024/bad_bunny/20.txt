By Kevin Slane 
With the Fourth of July falling on a Thursday this year, there are folks who have given themselves long weekends or entire weeks off to enjoy a summer break. That mostly means beaches, barbecues, and July 4 fireworks, but it also means there’s plenty of time to catch up on the newest movies and TV shows on streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
The first Shark Week aired on the Discovery Channel back in 1988, and the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned Max is adding even more shark content to its library this month. Disney and Hulu each have eight shark shows or specials of their own, while Peacock is adding all four “Jaws” movies to its library.
Netflix has a pair of ’80s nostalgia plays coming in July, with Eddie Murphy’s long-awaited sequel “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3) and the first part of the sixth and final season of “Karate Kid” spinoff “Cobra Kai” (July 18).
Other streaming highlights in July include the new Anthony Hopkins gladiator show “Those About to Die” (Peacock, July 18), the Natalie Portman murder mystery miniseries “Lady in the Lake” (Apple TV+, July 19), and the 12th season of Matt Groening’s animated space comedy “Futurama” (Hulu, July 29).
Below you’ll find a full list of what’s new in July 2024 on eight of the most popular streaming services in America: Netflix, Max (formerly HBO Max), Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, Apple TV+, Peacock, and Paramount+.
Note: Movies and TV shows recommended by Boston.com entertainment writer Kevin Slane are denoted by the 🍿 emoji. Notable new releases are denoted by the 🆕 emoji.
