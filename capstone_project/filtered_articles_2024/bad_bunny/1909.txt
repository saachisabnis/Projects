Drew McIntyre did some tweeting during his World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 40, and he drew a response from Bad Bunny.  As noted, McIntyre won the World Heavyweight Championship during the opening match of tonight’s show, but quickly lost it to a cashing-in Damian Priest after an altercation with CM Punk at the commentary booth.
McIntyre had tweeted during the match, writing:
“Bored at work. LOL!”
Bunny responded after McIntyre’s loss, snarking:
“hope you had a good shift”
