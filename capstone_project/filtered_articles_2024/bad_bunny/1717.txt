Khloe Kardashian has revealed what she would do if she were able to switch lives with her supermodel half-sister Kendall Jenner.
While Khloe, 39, has her hands full as a mother of two, Kendall, 28, is the only one of her siblings not to have any children yet.
If she were in Kendall's shoes, Khloe would indulge in the freedom of having 'no kids' and not having 'to wake up for carpool' in the morning.
She would throw herself into a party girl lifestyle, enjoying 'a f***ing tequila bottle for breakfast' and 'hooking up with every f***ing person,' she declared.
Kendall on the other hand 'definitely doesn't do any of those things, that's why she's wasting her life,' Khloe joked on the latest episode of The Kardashians. 'You're wasting it, Kendall. Let me be you for a second.'

The subject arose during a confessional when Khloe was asked: 'If you had to Freaky Friday one of your family members, who would you?'
Freaky Friday is a novel that has been adapted into multiple movies in which a mother and daughter realize, to their horror, that they have swapped bodies.
'I would have to say Kendall Jenner, because, why the f**k not? I want to be a supermodel, going around town I could hook up with this person,' said Khloe.
'Not that Kendall does that, but I would be doing that, hooking up with every f***ing person, drunk as a skunk, no kids, no f***ing responsibilities…' she added wistfully.
'She has responsibilities but like you know what I mean,' Khloe clarified. 'Like I don't have to wake up for carpool, I don't have to make someone's f***ing lunch, I am a f***ing supermodel with my Doberman and a f***ing tequila bottle for breakfast.'
Khloe proudly announced: 'I would do it every day. Leave that man, wherever I just f***ed him last, like yeah. Like she definitely doesn't do any of those things, that's why she's wasting her life. You're wasting it, Kendall. Let me be you for a second.' 
Kendall has just rekindled her romance with Bad Bunny, and the pair recently embarked on a romantic getaway to his native Puerto Rico.
They first went public as a couple in February 2023, but by the end of that year it emerged that they had brought the curtain down on their romance.

However by the first Monday of this May, Kendall and Bad Bunny were spotted together at a Met Gala afterparty, igniting a feverish round of reunion rumors.
Meanwhile Khloe shares her daughter True, six, and her son Tatum, one, with her NBA player ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson.
Khloe and Tristan had a tempestuous on-off relationship that was repeatedly buffeted by Tristan's infidelity before finally falling apart in 2021.
She left him for the last time when she learned that he had conceived his son Theo with fitness trainer Maralee Nichols while still dating Khloe.
By the time it emerged that Maralee had given birth to Tristan's baby, he and Khloe already had a surrogate pregnant with Tatum.

True was born less than 48 hours after DailyMail.com exclusively broke news of Tristan's alleged fling with New York City strip club bartender Lani Blair.
He and Khloe remained together then, but broke up in 2019 after Tristan shared a kiss at a party with Kylie Jenner's then best friend Jordyn Woods.
When the coronavirus lockdowns struck, Tristan and Khloe moved in together so they could both be with True - and wound up rekindling their romance as well.
Reports of their latest split began circulating in June 2021 as Tristan found himself denying a swirl of rumors about his fidelity.
Then DailyMail.com exclusively obtained court documents in late 2021 claiming Tristan was having a baby by Maralee, kicking off the scandal that ultimately prompted Khloe to end her romance with him for good.
