Allison Janney joins this hit thriller's explosive second series
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on Netflix
If you've seen series one of this hit thriller about the US ambassador in the UK, you'll know it ends on an enormous cliffhanger - that's resolved in the trailer for series two, but we won't spoil it either way here. 
One mystery that was revealed at the end of series one was the guilty party behind the attack on the British warship: the British Prime Minister (a wonderfully oily Rory Kinnear). So, what does headstrong US Ambassador Kate Wyler (The Americans' Keri Russell) do with that information? How can an American ambassador investigate the British PM? On top of that, Kate also got to deal with the arrival of US Vice President Grace Penn, who is convinced Kate is after her job. 
Seeing the way Kate deals with all that is the fun of this show, because she's the kind of no-nonsense character who does and says things we might all think, but would never actually do or say. She feels pretty realistic for this kind of show, and the big boon for series two is who's playing the VP she's pitched against - Allison Janney of The West Wing, an Oscar winner for I, Tonya and plenty more besides. The Diplomat has already been renewed for a third series and, on the evidence of how fun this is to watch, it's easy to see why. (Six episodes)
Follow the Prince Of Wales as he puts into action an ambitious programme to end homelessness
Year: 2024
Certificate: pg
Watch now on ITVX
'I don't believe we should be living with homelessness in the 21st century.' 
It's clear that Prince William cares passionately about this particular cause. It brings to mind images of him selling copies of the Big Issue two years ago, and sleeping rough on the streets for a night back in 2009, for charity Centrepoint. 
This two-part series, filmed over 12 months, follows the Prince of Wales as he sets out to show that it is possible to put an end homelessness. Inspired by his mother, Prince William continues Diana's campaigning on the issue and has, through his Royal Foundation, established Homewards, an ambitious five-year programme, starting with six locations across the UK. 
Cameras follow the prince as he visits the projects and recruits a team to bring the programme to life. He also spends time with the people the programme is designed to help, those individuals and families who have experienced life without a home, including TV presenter Gail Porter. 
We think his mother would be proud. (Two episodes)
Action series spin-off from the Gerard Butler movie franchise
Year: 2024
Watch now on Prime Video
When a former French Foreign Legion soldier goes rogue and organises a terrorist strike on Paris during a high-profile gathering of foreign dignitaries, it's up to protection officer Vincent Taleb (Tewfik Jallab) to halt his plans. He soon realises, though, that part of the French authorities may also be involved in the terror scheme, forcing him into a reluctant alliance with savvy MI6 agent Zara Taylor (Ritu Arya) in the battle to save the French capital. 
The first in a planned number of international TV spin-offs from the Olympus/London/Angel Has Fallen action series starring Gerard Butler, this is a rollicking eight-part action thriller. Butler himself may be absent, but Jallab and especially Arya (of The Umbrella Academy fame) are more than capable as stand-ins. The presence of Mission: Impossible baddie Sean Harris as the main villain adds no end of leering menace, too. Intriguingly, the series is the creation of Howard Overman - also the man behind such varied series as Misfits, Vexed and Atlantis. (Eight episodes) 
The black ops drama starring Zoe Saldana returns
Year: 2023
Certificate: 18
Watch now on Paramount+
Female operatives tasked with infiltrating the lives of terrorist suspects by any means necessary, the agents of the US government's Lioness program are always operating in something of a moral grey area. But that territory becomes even more murky as conflicted program boss Joe (Zoe Saldana) recruits a new operative - The Umbrella Academy's Genesis Rodriguez - to penetrate a threat much closer to American soil. 
With strong echoes of fellow espionage shows such as Jack Ryan - not least in the very welcome presence of that series' Michael Kelly in the cast - this is a taut and grown-up spy thriller packed with action and amoral wheeling and dealing in equal measure. The cast is astoundingly starry too, with Saldana joined again by Nicole Kidman and Morgan Freeman as the higher-ups who pull the strings of the Lioness program. (Eight episodes) 
Introducing DCI Ellis, the detective called in when cases go cold
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on My5
In the Peak District, a teenager is found dead in a car submerged in a lake; flashing back to the day before, we see the victim, Rowan, at a pool party with his drunk girlfriend, Maggie. So opens this new police drama, starring Sharon D Clarke as DCI Ellis who's called in when the investigation into Rowan's death and Maggie's disappearance stalls. 
At the local nick, things get off to a rocky start with DS Harper, who is sent to welcome her, and get more awkward when he introduces her to his DCI - 'I'm in charge,' says the old-school copper. 'Not any more,' she counters. Harper is assigned to report back on Ellis, but he is increasingly impressed by her insight and empathy, as well as her dedication- which means she finds clues the original investigators missed.
While the premise of this three-parter is great, the execution could be tighter - a fair few scenes feel superfluous - but Ellis and Harper have the makings of a great TV tec team. It's a slow-burner, heavy on atmosphere and tension, but stick with it, as it does - eventually - pick up pace. (Three episodes)
Documentary about a woman's claim she was abducted by aliens
Year: 2024
Certificate: 12
Watch now on Netflix
In November 1989, Linda Napolitano was pulled up into the sky above her Manhattan home and taken into a spacecraft by aliens. More than 20 witnesses claim they saw her hanging in the air in a beam of light. Is it the greatest alien-abduction case on record? Or just an insanely complicated and believable hoax? 
This strange and compelling documentary attempts to prise out the answer to that question, and follows a filmmaker who was on the scene at the time as she tries to pin down what is and isn't real about Linda's story. It's much less an attempt to decide if alien abductions are real, and more a film about just what kind of a person might fool the world into believing that this particular one happened - and how, and, crucially, why, she might have gone about the whole complex and compelling charade. (Three episodes) 
Documentary charting the up-and-down life of US style icon Martha Stewart
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on Netflix
The US queen of catering, cookbooks and TV shows who championed a certain cosy style of domestic bliss, Martha Stewart was one of the biggest names in the American media at the start of the 21st century. But then everything went wrong, as allegations of insider stock trading saw her serving five months in federal prison. 
Oscar-nominated filmmaker RJ Cutler's bright and probing documentary marries hours of one-to-one chats with Stewart herself with archive footage and access to her friends and colleagues to paint a picture of the fierce and powerful woman behind the glossy media image. This fascinating and revealing film charts not only her rise to fame and fall from grace, but also her successful post-prison battle to regain control of her businesses and return to the top of the media pile. (113 minutes) 
Long-lost twins discover their story in 1980s divided Germany 
Year: 2021-2022
Certificate: 12
Watch now on Channel 4
This German series is set in 1988 as East Germany, the GDR, gears up to celebrates 40 glorious years - yet we know two years later it was reunited with West Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It's against this political and historical backdrop that the drama plays out.
Christine is a dancer at the famous Friedrichstadt-Palast music hall in East Berlin, who is spotted on stage by Marlene, a visitor from West Germany. Chris and Marlene look exactly alike and they are indeed 27-year-old twins who were separated at birth, both played by actress Svenja Jung.
As the sisters piece together their family history we also get flashbacks to their parents' story - both physicists, their mum stayed in the east, their dad joined the capitalist family firm in the west -and an entertaining and insightful look at the contrasts of lives and ideals either side of the Iron Curtain. 
The women have much to learn from each other and it's a nice touch that Chris is the more free-spirited of the two, despite being the one living in the more restrictive GDR. (Six episodes)
Off-kilter German comedy about a lawyer who uses mindfulness to murder
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on Netflix
Mindfulness is a modern term for being in and appreciating the moment, and it tends to have peaceful associations. Not so in this offbeat German thriller, which decides to link it to something altogether more violent. 
'I'm not a violent person, quite the opposite. I didn't kill anyone until I was 42,' says the show's main character Björn, a high-flying lawyer and family man who attends a mindfulness retreat and is suddenly struck by how he can rid his life of all its irritations: murder.   
Based on the book by Karsten Dusse, this pleasingly off-kilter comedic thriller follows Björn (Tom Schilling) as he sets about clear-headedly solving the problems, starting with his brutal mobster client.
It's a bold way to begin that attracts a lot of attention - from both sides of the law - but it's all just sensory information to the newly serene Björn, who will stop at nothing to have more time to stop and smell the roses with his family. 
The deadpan Schilling is a lot of fun to watch in this nicely shot show, one that is all the better for being a limited series. (Eight episodes) 
Documentary looking at the life and work of the legendary film music composer
Year: 2024
Watch now on Disney+
How can a handful of notes summon up the menace of a killer shark? Bring dinosaurs to life? Or help whisk thousands off on adventures with Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter? 
That's what this documentary film attempts to answer as it investigates the amazingly creative life of John Williams, arguably the greatest composer of movie soundtracks of all time. 
Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard are just two of the talking heads on hand here to help tell the story of how Williams went from an early career as a jazz pianist to become a composer of iconic scores with no less than 54 Oscar nominations to his name, not to mention five actual wins. 
It's a marvellous documentary shot through with spine-tingling snippets of some of the most instantly recognisable film themes ever composed. (96 minutes) 
The perils of a younger, better you - starring Demi Moore
Year: 2024
Certificate: 18
Watch now on Mubi
All the attention has been on Demi Moore and her comeback here is incredible - bold, cheeky and easily a career-best performance, but don't come into this expecting anything like the films she's done before. This is about as far from Ghost as you can get.
Moore stars as Elisabeth Sparkle, a faded Hollywood star turned Jane Fonda-like TV aerobics bunny. When misogynist studio executives (led by a cartoonishly toady Dennis Quaid) seek to replace her with a younger model, she subscribes to the Substance, less weight-loss injection, more mad-science procedure. Margaret Qualley takes over as Sue, Elisabeth's body-swap-horror alter ego, and this is where the satire of sexism and ageism really takes off.
Shocking as it may be, the story is so clever and well-executed that even though it scales nausea-inducing heights of gross and gruesome, you go along with it. The mad, blood-drenched escalation and denouement also feel entirely logical. And funny. The wicked, twisted sense of humour is consistent throughout, taking some of the pain away, though still keeping the jab of the point well aimed and sharp. (141 minutes)
Jacob Fortune-Lloyd plays Beatles manager Brian Epstein in this biopic
Year: 2024
Certificate: 12
Watch now on Prime Video
Brian Epstein died of an accidental overdose in 1967, aged just 32. You can feel that fact waiting in the wings of this biopic, and it's tragic enough all by itself. As such, they don't feel the need to overplay the rest of the darkness in his life during the film's near two-hour length. 
No, this is very much a celebration of what one man achieved in a short space of time, and Epstein - played here with a lovely mix of charm, confidence and vulnerability by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd - certainly did that with the Beatles.
When we first meet Brian he's selling furniture in his dad's shop and suggesting that perhaps they should start selling pop records, as he has an uncanny ear for knowing what people want. When we leave him he's on top of the world, with the Beatles broadcasting to a global audience. 
Fortune-Lloyd talks to us throughout, turning to camera to relate facts about touring with the Fab Four and the ups and downs of realising his dream. Eddie Marsan and Emily Watson play his stoic dad and supportive mum, while the cast of those playing the Beatles and a certain young miss Cilla Black bring real joy to the movie. 
Expect to feel drawn in by Fortune-Lloyd and the film's artistic way with a camera, and occasionally put off by its wanderings towards cheese - but this is a lovely movie overall, and one simply teeming with talent both in front of and behind the camera. It deserves to find a good audience. (112 minutes) 
Glamorous 1960s-set airline drama starring Christina Ricci and Margot Robbie
Year: 2011-2012
Watch now on ITVX
Set in the early 1960s, this American drama series is a light-hearted, glossily constructed, nostalgic homage to the glory days of air travel, when Pan Am was one of the most glamorous places to work, not only in the US, but in the world. Christina Ricci stars as Maggie, one of several lucky stewardesses given the chance to work aboard the sleek new Clipper plane - the height of sophistication. 
The show looks great throughout, although the modern sensibilities of the characters sit a little awkwardly with the realities of the 1960s at times. It's all good fun though, and should be taken as such - the wider cast is terrific, and also includes a then relatively unknown Margot Robbie - the future box-office megastar of Barbie. (14 episodes) 
Ralph Fiennes and Indira Varma star in a powerhouse stage production 
Year: 2023
Certificate: 12
Watch now on National Theatre At Home
'Powerhouse' is the best word for the two performances that drive this production: Ralph Fiennes as Macbeth, and Indira Varma as his clever wife. Simon Godwin's clearly delivered production shifts the conflict that forms the backdrop of Shakespeare's story into a very modern warzone, with Fiennes moving in military fatigues around a ruined urban set that's full of clever, atmospheric touches - especially for those who saw it live.
The horror of war is a strong theme in this staging, but it's not without its lighter moments - Varma's comic timing as Lady Macbeth provides some of them, as part of a fully rounded performance that also gives us vulnerability and delirium to balance out her ambition. Varma is always an electric stage presence and that's especially true here, while Fiennes's Macbeth feels slower and heavier, very much the older partner in their marriage. As a whole this is a production for Shakespeare fans who like the Bard's work to look and feel a little different, but to remain fundamentally untouched. (150 minutes) 
Spooky short film anthology for the digital age
Year: 2020
Certificate: 15
Watch now on ITVX
A collection of six spooky short films that explore familiar horror themes and offer moral punchlines, but with a modern twist - smart phones, surveillance cameras, online dating, the stories unleashed all feature these commonplace tools of the digital age.
The first film, for example, is a highly effective mystery filmed entirely on a car's dash-cam. There's another one that's about an old gent getting ready for an online date that cleverly upends your expectations of that kind of set-up. These are the standouts in a six-part series that, as with so many anthologies, offers stories that are good, bad and downright ugly. (Six episodes)
Colin Morgan stars in an Irish drama about a lost boy
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on NOW
Watch now on Sky
There's a long list of dramas about missing children, and that includes this four-parter from Ireland - but it comes with a twist that draws you in from the start. Colin Morgan and Toni O'Rourke star as Harry and Robin, a couple who lose their son in an earthquake in North Africa and then, three years later - just when they are starting to heal from the grief, and just as Robin is pregnant again - Harry thinks he sees their son on the streets of Dublin, and becomes understandably obsessed with finding him.
Filmed in Ireland and Morocco and peppered with flashbacks that illuminate rather than frustrate our progress through the story, this haunting, naturalistically acted story digs into the cracks in Harry and Robin's relationship and comes with an intriguing supporting role for Simon Callow as Cozimo, a man with a very heavy accent - and possibly some secrets. It's based on the novel by Karen Perry, which is actually a pen name for two writers - Paul Perry and Karen Gillece. (Four episodes)
Unearthing buried skeletons feared to be the living dead 
Year: 2024
Watch now on NOW
In a field in Poland, archaeologists uncovered the skeleton of a woman with a padlock on her toe and a sickle across her neck. Why would someone be buried that way? Did the people at the time fear her to be a vampire? 
That restricted pile of bones is an intriguing mystery all by itself, but the case becomes even more fascinating when you learn that she is surrounded by up to 30 further 'deviant burials'. Why were these people singled out and so feared as the 'living dead'?
This UK-produced documentary digs deep into the case of the first skeleton, with contributions from the historian Dan Jones as the mystery of that burial and others like it are unfurled across two parts that take us from Europe to the US. There's plenty of cutting-edge science deployed in the case, too, including some pioneering facial reconstruction technology. (Two episodes) 
Horror comedy about a girl who time travels to save her sister
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on Netflix
In 2003, a trio of high school girls are brutally murdered by a mysterious slasher. In the present, the younger sister of one of the dead girls finds a way to time travel back to the year of their deaths. Can she manage to save their lives? Will she shatter the space-time continuum if she does? And if everything goes badly, is she just adding her own name to the killer's to-do list? 
A vibrant blend of Back To The Future and Scream, this is a smart and knowing comedy horror. Outer Banks' Madison Bailey is relatable and very likeable as the time-travelling lead in a Friday-night movie that manages to have its fish-out-of-water time-travel cake and gulp it all down with lashings of jumpy, scary, slasher shocks. (90 minutes)
Flesh-eating baby boomers get a taste for teenagers in Ben Wheatley's darkly comic, outlandishly gory, zombie-horror satire
Year: 2024
Certificate: 15
Watch now on Channel 4
You might be thinking we don't need another zombie show. Even if you're a fan, there's an awful lot of them. But this is a bit special. Firstly, it's the first original TV series from Ben Wheatley, a British film director who has always been inventive (Kill List, Sightseers, Free Fire). And secondly, as the title suggests, this isn't just a war between the living and the walking dead, but between the generations - the 60+ boomers (Sue Johnston, Anita Dobson, Robert Lindsay) and the teenage Gen Zers (Somewhere Boy's Lewis Gribben and The Nevers' Viola Prettejohn).
When a chemical spill near a residential home unleashes a zombie-like infection, it's dog eat dog (literally) as the OAPs go on a flesh-eating rampage, while also dealing with a few of the chips they've been carrying on their shoulders.
Crucially, these older zombies are also wiser, they can still talk and, rather than being reduced to shuffling automatons driven only by the urge to chew brains, they are conscious, able to communicate, and if anything, stronger. As one of them puts it: 'I don't know what's going on, but I like it.'
When the gore comes it's full on (it is a zombie show after all) but Wheatley knows his genre and that horror isn't just about gore, but can also be astute and satirical, as well as entertaining and fun. The humour and wit comes as thick and fast as the violence and there's a wide range of characters, of different ages and backgrounds, who each have their own crosses to bear and views about the state of things. It's an exhilarating, provocative ride. (Six episodes)
Child-friendly sequel to classic Disney show Wizards Of Waverly Place
Year: 2024
Certificate: pg
Watch now on Disney+
Piggybacking on the teen magician craze sparked by Harry Potter, Wizards Of Waverly Place ran for four very successful primary-coloured series up to 2012 - helping to make a star of Selena Gomez along the way - and told the story of a trio of teens learning how to use their magical powers secretly in the modern world. 
This spin-off series picks up the story of former wizard Justin Russo (original Waverly Place cast member David Henrie) a dozen years later as he lives a quiet non-magical life with his wife and two sons. Or at least his life is quiet until a rebellious young female wizard (Janice LeAnn Brown) turns up needing training. 
Cue heartwarming sitcom adventures with a moral message or two scattered about for good measure. Not to mention the occasional guest appearance from Gomez, when she has a free moment away from Only Murders In The Building. (Ten episodes)
