	Legendary hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. paved the way as the original music-artist sneaker collaborators, revolutionizing the sneaker game in the mid 1980s. Interestingly, this fusion of music and footwear wasn’t planned. The group’s iconic track “My Adidas” was simply a tribute to its love for the Adidas Superstar, famously known as Shell Toes.

	










Billboard caught up with Rev. Run and D.M.C., and they shared the surprising backstory behind their legendary partnership with Adidas. Remarkably, the song “My Adidas” came first, and their deal with the iconic three stripes followed. “We were doing it because we loved the sneaker — it was in our mind, so we wrote the rhyme, just bottom line,” Run explains to Billboard. D.M.C. adds, “I remember getting my first pair of Adidas and putting it on my dresser. When I went to sleep that night, I waved goodnight to it because I couldn’t wait to see it in the morning.”

	For them, the song wasn’t about chasing a deal — it was about honoring something meaningful. “It wasn’t about getting anything — it was about representing something that was powerful, durable, strong, and cool as hell,” D.M.C. concludes.

	The track became a cultural movement, and the Adidas Shell Toes could be seen everywhere hip-hop was played. Adidas took notice and offered the group a groundbreaking endorsement. The deal marked the first time a major sports brand partnered with hip-hop artists, becoming a pivotal moment in sneaker culture. This groundbreaking collaboration not only bridged the worlds of sports and music, but also revolutionized how sneakers were marketed, cementing their role as cultural symbols beyond the athletic arena.

	This year brought a unique shift in the sneaker landscape, marking a departure from trends fans have grown accustomed to. The dunk hype continued its decline, Yeezys hit clearance racks at $50 and Adidas demonstrated its resilience without Ye (formerly Kanye West), fueled by the rise of the Adidas AE1. Meanwhile, brands such as Asics and New Balance capitalized on the evolving sneaker market, experiencing notable growth in sales.

	










	So now, Billboard is debuting its first-ever list of best sneakers from musicians. Check out the full breakdown below.

Wale, an unwavering Nike advocate and one of the DMV’s (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) most prominent sneakerheads, has consistently elevated sneaker culture through his music and influence. From his 2008 hit “Nike Boots” to countless shout-outs in his lyrics, Wale has championed Nike without any formal partnership, a fact he has publicly addressed on multiple occasions.

	The Nike Foamposite “DMV” earns an honorable mention on this list, not as Wale’s official sneaker, but as a long-overdue acknowledgment of his impact. Featuring prominently in the campaign, Wale lent his artistry to the release with heartfelt track “Ghetto Speak,” dedicated to the greater Washington, D.C., area.

	Wale’s involvement extended beyond the campaign. The rapper hosted a special Foamposite collector giveaway, inviting fans to submit photos wearing their favorite pairs for a chance to win. This initiative showcased Wale’s deep commitment to the sneaker community and highlighted his connection to Foamposites — a staple in DMV fashion.

	The Nike Foamposite “DMV” is a love letter to the region that has long embraced Foamposites. The sneaker’s vibrant pink upper, inspired by the area’s cherry blossoms, is complemented by black nubuck and mesh overlays. Cherry blossom graphics are on the blue insoles, while a pink mini Swoosh and subtle pink outsole accents complete the look. “DMV” branding on the heel pull tabs proudly nod to the region’s identity, making the design both stylish and meaningful.

	










	Exclusively released on Aug. 23 at select DMV retailers for $240, the Foamposite “DMV” was more than just a sneaker — it became a cultural event. Wale’s involvement elevated the drop into a celebration of hometown pride, uniting music, fashion and community. For DMV sneaker enthusiasts, this release solidified Wale’s enduring influence and celebrated the region’s iconic sneaker culture.

NLE Choppa teamed up with FCTRY Lab to make a statement in footwear again this year, introducing the Black Duck Boot, a sleek follow-up to its viral Yellow Duck Boot from last spring. With this release, NLE Choppa infuses his distinctive style and the dynamic energy of his live performances into a more fashion-forward iteration of the bold design.

	The Black Duck Boot is a versatile creation that balances functionality and flair, suitable for both urban adventures and everyday wear. The sleek matte black colorway maintains the disruptive contours of the original while offering a more understated, wearable option. Built with durable EVA foam and a vegan leather collar, the boot reflects a commitment to sustainability without compromising on style.

	The release, which dropped on Oct. 5, was celebrated with a first-come, first-serve event at Concepts NYC, where fans had the opportunity to meet NLE Choppa. He added a unique personal touch to the launch by signing boxes for lucky buyers, creating a memorable experience for fans.

	While the Black Duck Boot’s classification as a boot rather than a sneaker places it in the honorable mentions category, its bold design, commitment to eco-conscious craftsmanship and connection to NLE Choppa’s artistry make it a standout release of 2024.

	










	After seven years of manifesting his dream partnership with Nike, Grammy-nominated rapper and sneaker enthusiast Lil Yachty debuted the Nike Air Force 1 “Concrete Boys” — a sneaker that blends classic Air Force 1 elements with his unique personal touch. Released on Dec. 2, this highly anticipated collaboration transitioned from a Friends & Family exclusive to a public release, solidifying its place as a must-have for fans and collectors.

	The “Concrete Boys” stays true to the Air Force 1’s iconic legacy, showcasing a crisp white leather upper accented by deep navy detailing on the sockliner and outsole. Yachty’s design draws inspiration from early 2000s AF1 classics such as the Roc-a-Fella, Terror Squad and West Indies editions, creating a silhouette that feels both nostalgic and contemporary.

	Personalization is key to this release, with Yachty’s signature “It’s Us” ad-lib featured on the tongue, insoles and plastic hangtag. The sneaker also incorporates the Concrete Boys’ stick-figure graphic and a bold “C” logo on the heel tab, adding subtle yet impactful branding that pays homage to Yachty’s crew and creative vision.

	Though minimalist in design, the “Concrete Boys” Air Force 1 exemplifies the timeless appeal of a clean AF1 while honoring its rich history. With this thoughtful and stylish collaboration, Lil Yachty has cemented his place in sneaker culture, proving that some things never go out of style.

	Adidas Originals and Bad Bunny have once again teamed up, this time releasing the Gazelle San Juan, a modern reimagining of the iconic Gazelle silhouette. The sneaker pays homage to Benito’s Puerto Rican roots, celebrating the island’s culture, streets and heritage. Over the course of three years, the collaboration between Adidas Originals and Bad Bunny has produced 18 sneakers, with even more teased releases, including the highly anticipated Taekwondo Ballerina shoe.

	










	Released on June 23 at select retailers, the Gazelle San Juan launched in conjunction with Noche and Día de San Juan, retailing for $140. This remix of the classic Gazelle featured a suede toe cap and a warped T-bar, adding a unique twist to the design. The collaboration has explored five different silhouettes, each featuring signature design elements such as double-tongues, a warped T-bar and a third-eye emblem, among others. These details often hold deeper significance for dedicated Bad Bunny fans, with the double-tongue, for example, symbolizing Benito’s bilingual abilities. These thoughtful touches go beyond mere aesthetics, offering fans a personal connection to the designs.

	The Gazelle San Juan honors Puerto Rican pride and reflects Benito’s deep connection to the island and its people. Inspired by the vibrant colors of San Juan’s historic cobblestone streets, the sea, the beach and the Noche de San Juan, the sneaker encapsulates the essence of Puerto Rico, bringing it to a global audience.

	While the sneaker may not have been the most eye-catching release, the sneaker community embraced it with enthusiasm. Its success led to the release of another colorway in a more classic white, black and gum combination. This version also featured “Benito” branding in place of “San Juan,” further personalizing the collaboration.

	This year has been monumental for women’s basketball, and the Hommewrk x Saucony Spot-Bilt Sonic Hi celebrates its enduring legacy and impact on the sport. The year 1976 is prominently featured on the shoe’s heel, commemorating the historic debut of women’s basketball at the Summer Olympics, where Lusia Harris, considered the “Godmother of Basketball,” made history by scoring the first-ever basket in Olympic women’s basketball. Among her numerous achievements, she holds the distinction of being the only woman ever drafted by an NBA team, selected by the New Orleans Jazz in 1977. Additional standout details include functional hair clip-inspired deubrés on the laces, blending practicality with a nod to personal style.

	










Trinidad James and his brand Hommewrk have dedicated years to crafting meaningful projects. Focused on bridging the past and future, the clothing line educates through its designs while partnering with schools to provide students with exclusive uniforms. Each release carries a deeper purpose, often honoring underrepresented figures. This particular drop stands out for continuing that mission — using his platform to inspire while reviving a vintage Saucony classic.

Jack Harlow joined New Balance as an ambassador in February 2022, sparking excitement among fans and sneaker enthusiasts eagerly anticipating a collaboration. Two years later, the much-awaited partnership came to fruition with the release of the Jack Harlow x New Balance 1906R “Rose Runner.” This updated iteration of the popular 2010 running shoe launched on Oct. 4, retailing for $180.  

	The 1906R “Rose Runner” showcases a striking blend of pink and magenta floral patterns across its upper, delivering a vibrant and artistic vibe. A velour tongue and lace detailing add a luxurious touch, enhancing the premium feel of the design. Inside, watercolor-style paintings of a man and woman adorn the insoles, offering a unique artistic element. The look is completed with an earthy green rubber outsole that complements the bold upper while grounding the aesthetic in nature-inspired tones.  

	For the sneaker’s debut, Harlow hosted a first-come, first-serve (FCFS) release at Oneness Boutique in Louisville’s Cherokee Triangle neighborhood. Fans lined up for blocks to secure a pair, and Harlow made a personal appearance, signing sneakers and engaging with his supporters.  

	










	The “Rose Runner” was a hit, selling out instantly both in-store and online, solidifying its status as a standout release in 2024.

J Balvin has built a strong presence in the world of sneaker collaborations, beginning with his partnership with Jordan Brand in December 2020 for the release of the “Colores Y Vibras” Air Jordan 1. This was followed by the Air Jordan 2 “Celestine Blue” in 2022 and the Air Jordan 3 “Medellín Sunset” in 2023.  

	His fourth collaboration with Jordan Brand, the “Rio” Air Jordan 3, launched on May 22 for $250. This new design follows the success of last year’s “Medellín Sunset” and pays tribute to Balvin’s son. The sneaker reimagines the purple-to-yellow gradient of its predecessor, opting instead for a black leather exterior. Unique features include mismatched Nike Swoosh logos, smiley face details on the heel and a lightning bolt that serves as the “i” in “Air.” The shoe also boasts an orange interior on the tongue and a translucent outsole in the same color. 

	The “Rio” Air Jordan 3 had been highly anticipated since the fall of the previous year, when Balvin was spotted wearing them during a basketball game with Jimmy Butler in New York City. The sighting sparked widespread excitement across social media. Leading up to the release in May 2024, Balvin surprised fans by dropping the sneakers early on his website. In an effort to combat bot purchases, Balvin introduced a creative pricing tactic: The sneakers were initially listed for $25,000, 100 times the actual retail price of $250. This move was meant to discourage bots and help ensure the release was accessible to his loyal fans. To purchase the sneakers, customers needed a password to access the site, and then a discount code “Lego24@” to bring the price to the actual retail. Balvin addressed the reactions to his bot protection method, commenting, “Yep, people first.”

Travis Scott’s collaboration with Nike and Jordan Brand has redefined the sneaker game since its inception in 2017, and one of the latest additions to this iconic partnership, the Jordan Jumpman Jack TR, kept the momentum alive.

	The sneaker had a surprise limited release on Feb. 4 — Grammy night — via Travis Scott’s website. This drop coincided with his nomination for best rap album, adding to the buzz even though he didn’t take home the award. Set at $200, the Jordan Jumpman Jack TR officially released on April 30.

	Rumors of the Jumpman Jack began swirling in July 2023, with fans eagerly awaiting its official reveal. The Jordan campaign did not disappoint, showcasing Travis Scott in a striking Vitruvian Man-inspired pose, holding the sneakers — a nod to the cultural and artistic weight of this release.

	The Jordan Jumpman Jack TR combines trainer functionality with high-end aesthetics. Key features include a Travis Scott’s signature Reverse Swoosh, Cactus Jack smiley logo on the heel and 3D embroidery on the strap for added texture and grip. The Jordan Jumpman Jack TR earned its spot on the list for a simple reason: It sold out every single time it dropped, regardless of the website. This brand-new silhouette sparked endless conversations on Twitter, proving its cultural impact.  

	Backed by Travis Scott’s creative vision, the Jumpman Jack stands out with its unique design and undeniable hype, solidifying its place as one of the most talked-about sneaker releases of the year.

	The world has been eagerly awaiting a Nike and Nigo collaboration for years, and on Oct. 4, that dream finally came true with the release of the Nigo Nike Air Force 3 Low.

	During his time at A Bathing Ape, Nigo introduced sneakers heavily influenced by Nike models, creating iconic designs such as the BAPE STA, which drew inspiration from the Air Force 1. Many sneaker collectors came to love the BAPE STA as much as, if not more than, the AF1, thanks to its bold colorways and frequent use of patent leather.

	










	The Nike x Nigo Air Force 3 features a premium upper crafted from embossed leathers and textiles, paired with a midsole foam and rubber outsole that pays homage to the original AF3 design. The tongue and heel graphics celebrate both the classic sneaker and Nigo’s cultural influence.

	The custom packaging adds an extra layer of appeal, showcasing the story behind the launch colorway while hinting at future footwear and apparel releases. Inside, it includes an exclusive patch and pin designed specifically for this debut edition.

	This collaboration had a remarkable rollout. An anime-style trailer introduced a new universe for the sneaker, reminiscent of Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers and Kamen Rider. Additionally, Nigo and Nike brought back the excitement of sneaker campouts. The Nike x Nigo Air Force 3 and its accompanying apparel collection dropped exclusively on Sept. 28 at Otsumo Plaza in Tokyo, Human Made’s website and the I Know Nigo 2 pop-up in New York, with a global launch on Oct. 4 via SNKRS.

	The I Know Nigo 2 pop-up in New York generated immense buzz, with fans camping out in line the night before the release. The scene was vibrant, with sneaker enthusiasts sharing stories — and even pizza — while awaiting the drop.

	With its nostalgic campouts, premium packaging and an authentic storytelling rollout that resonated with fans, this collaboration was a must-have on our list.

A$AP Rocky and PUMA have redefined innovation with the Mostro 3.D Slip-On, an avant-garde sneaker crafted through a cutting-edge resin-based 3D printing process. This shoe marks PUMA’s first foray into fully 3D-printed footwear, constructed entirely from a single material without traditional techniques such as stitching or gluing.

	










	The original Mostro silhouette was already unconventional, but Rocky’s reinterpretation takes it to a futuristic level. Debuting at the Welcome to the Amazing Mostro Show during New York Fashion Week, the Mostro 3.D is a bold reimagining of PUMA’s archival model, known for its spiky sole and low-profile design. A$AP Rocky has pushed the boundaries of footwear design, transforming the iconic spiky sole into an all-over textured feature, giving the sneaker a dragon-scale-like appearance.

	The Mostro 3.D is immediately striking with its synthetic upper drenched in a vibrant red, accented by a black gradient effect along the midsole. Hexagonal honeycomb patterns and circular perforations further emphasize its futuristic aesthetic. This daring design merges art with functionality, creating a statement piece unlike anything else in the sneaker world.

	Released on Sept. 26 for $250, the PUMA x A$AP Rocky Mostro 3.D was one of the most experimental and sought-after sneakers of the year. Despite its unconventional appearance, it resonated with fans and sold out quickly. The collaboration stands as a bold testament to Rocky’s vision and PUMA’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of sneaker innovation.

Action Bronson has added another title to his multifaceted career — sneaker designer — releasing not just one of the best New Balances this year, but one of the top sneakers overall. The Action Bronson x New Balance 1906R “Rosewater” is a vibrant, attention-grabbing design. Featuring a pink base, the sneaker is enhanced with a bright pink TPU heel overlay, a silver-and-blue “N” logo for a touch of sophistication and bold volt green laces that create striking contrast. 

	The upper consists of semi-translucent ripstop TPU layered over a creamy mesh and leather base, accented with pink details on the tongue, midfoot and heel. Gray suede appears on the toe and the vamp’s “N” branding, while orange mesh on the heel ties into the matching foam midsole. Inside, the insole features co-branded Action Bronson Baklava and New Balance logos. Inspired by women’s aerobics, the “Rosewater” release merges retro influence with modern flair.

	










	Debuting on May 31 via Action Bronson’s website and later releasing through New Balance on July 12, the sneakers sold out in fewer than five minutes — a testament to the demand. Bronson continues to reshape New Balance’s image, pushing the brand beyond its “dad shoe” reputation and into the spotlight of modern sneaker culture. 

	The rollout was equally compelling. In a heartwarming video filmed on the Manhattan Bridge, Action Bronson and his wife are seen dancing, hugging and enjoying each other’s company. While his wife sported the “Rosewater” pair, Bronson wore his “Medusa Azul” 1906R design. The wholesome visuals offered a fresh perspective on sneaker storytelling, making the shoes not just a fashion statement, but a celebration of connection and love.

	The Jae Tips x Saucony collaboration introduced The To Do List pack, featuring the third partnership between the two brands with a focus on the ProGrid Omni 9, a retro-runner originally released in the mid-2000s. The updated design bursts with vibrant hues, showcasing a honeycomb mesh upper with textile overlays, along with custom embroidered details on the tongue, heel and sockliner.

	The To Do List collection is not just a sneaker release — it’s a tribute to the Bronx and New York City lifestyle, goal setting and the importance of comfortable, reliable sneakers that help navigate tasks with ease. The collection also includes two colorways of the Saucony ProGrid Omni 9 and, for the first time, two kids’ Shadow 6000s, further emphasizing Jae Tips’ connection to family and his belief in inspiring the next generation. The sneakers are housed in custom packaging that mirrors the vibrant designs of the shoes, with branding details such as “Made by Jae Tips” and “Savior” prominently featured.

	










	The first colorway feature a peachy-cream honeycomb mesh on the toe, with a hot pink panel overlaid on the toe and tan with red detailing on the side. Light blue accents appear on the side overlays, while light pink leather eyelets are detailed with red and blue. A semi-translucent overlay in black diamonds runs along the side, and a reflective Saucony logo adds a pop of red and blue on the midfoot. The heel retains the same cream color, with a pink translucent TPU layer and red detailing at the back. The outsole mixes tan, blue, pink and red for a bold finish. On the medial side of the right sneaker, you’ll find Jae Tips’ signature Globe, while the left sneaker features the Jae Tips flower on its medial side. The sneakers are paired with peach laces and showcase a green mesh interior, complete with “Made by Jae Tips” branding.

	The second colorway shifts to neon pink on the toe, with a purple overlay and black details across the toe and side. A gray overlay with light pink details appears on the side, and the eyelets showcase purple and pink accents. The 3D TPU layer in purple on the side is complemented by a blue Saucony logo. The heel is accented by a pink see-through layer and a purple Savior logo. The purple laces, navy tongue mesh and cream overlays complete the vibrant look. The interior features the same green mesh with “Made by Jae Tips,” while the midsole blends navy, light blue and hot pink. The outsole is finished in light blue and pink.

	Jae Tips delivered an incredible rollout for this sneaker. He hosted a pop-up at Billionaire Boys Club, reviving the nostalgic campout culture cherished by sneaker enthusiasts. The event featured a limited release of Billionaire Boys Club x Jae Tips shirts designed to complement the sneakers. This unique experience wasn’t limited to New York; Jae Tips collaborated with sneaker stores in cities including Seattle and Boston, where he personally signed sneakers and boxes and posed for photos with every buyer.

	










	With each release, Jae Tips continues to prioritize the community aspect of sneaker culture. His projects tell authentic stories that resonate with almost everyone, making them both relatable and memorable. Additionally, Jae Tips has brought significant attention to the Saucony brand. While Saucony has always been respected, Tips has drawn in new fans — people who hadn’t purchased Saucony sneakers before and might never have considered them otherwise.

	It’s safe to say Jae Tips is emerging as the people’s favorite sneaker collaborator.

	After 25 years, the legendary Nike Wu-Tang Dunk High finally made its triumphant return, cementing itself as one of the most highly anticipated sneaker releases in history.

	Originally released in 1999 in collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan, this sneaker’s striking yellow and black “Goldenrod” colorway — accentuated by the iconic Wu-Tang logo on the heel — has become the stuff of legends. With only 100 pairs originally produced and a mere 36 made available to the public as a nod to the group’s debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), it quickly became a grail among collectors and a milestone in sneaker culture.

	At a time when artist-sneaker collaborations were nearly unheard of, the Wu-Tang Dunk trailblazed the path for today’s numerous music-brand partnerships, merging streetwear with the cultural clout of hip-hop. This groundbreaking collaboration not only elevated the sneaker’s mystique, but also solidified its place in history.

	










	The 2024 retro release lived up to its hype. Nike Sportswear teased the sneaker’s comeback with a social media campaign that pulled in more than 96,000 likes.

	In true Wu-Tang style, the launch was accompanied by a memorable experience. A Wu-Tang-branded ice cream truck parked outside Madison Square Garden handed out free Wu-branded ice cream and T-shirts, culminating in a surprise concert by the Wu-Tang Clan. The launch became a celebration of the group’s legacy, uniting music and sneaker culture in unforgettable fashion.

	Nike also had an innovated early access strategy, offering fans with extensive Wu-Tang listening history on Spotify an exclusive chance to purchase the sneakers. This creative campaign rewarded loyalty, while also engaging a younger audience on streaming.

	To top it all off, the Clan created hexagonal collector’s boxes, inspired by Wu-Tang’s signature style. The box included not only the coveted Dunks, but also a Staten Island Honey-scented candle and a co-branded T-shirt.

	There was also a photoshoot that featured RZA alongside New York Knicks stars Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges, blending the worlds of music, sports and fashion in a way that celebrated Wu-Tang’s impact across generations.

	When the Nike Wu-Tang Dunk High officially dropped on Nov. 9, it satisfied the decades-long anticipation of both OG collectors and new fans alike. From the early NikeTalk forums to today’s TikTok feeds, this release underscored Wu-Tang’s timeless influence and reaffirmed that the sneaker culture is as alive and impactful as ever.
