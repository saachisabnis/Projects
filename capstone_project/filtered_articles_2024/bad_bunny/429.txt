Bunny’s story: Bunny was found as a stray in pretty bad shape, but she has fully recovered. She has a short tail and the best ears ever. Because her teeth were in terrible shape, they were all pulled. But that doesn’t matter to her; she eats all types of foods, and she’ll never need another dental. She is gets along with people and other animals and loves attention. Bunny has a condition called dry eye – her eyes don’t produce enough tears – and will require medication for life. But she’s worth the effort and does really well on the medicine.
Adoption cost: $250
Adoption procedure: Visit Pups and Pals’ website for complete adoption procedures and an application, which must be received before meeting Bunny. If you have questions about Bunny not answered on the website, call 562-713-5103. Pups and Pals has other dogs if she is not your perfect match.
