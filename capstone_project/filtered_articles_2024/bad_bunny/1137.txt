Bad Bunny is taking some time out of his busy schedule to share his wisdom and experience with students.
The celebrated musician and recent Saturday Night Live host made a surprise appearance at the Florida International University's Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism, as part of The David Grutman Experience -- a class led by famed restaurateur, David Grutman.
Surprising over 400 students, Bad Bunny "talked of being a dreamer and always giving it his all to achieve his goals, be it in music, fashion, or with Gekko," a source told ET. "He shared that he only does things that are authentic to him."
The 29-year-old singer, who was born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, was met with delight and excitement from the FIU students, who listened to Bad Bunny and Grutman discuss their experiences in entertainment and their paths to success.
Needless to say, the artist's unexpected sit-down was a big hit with those in the class.
Grutman has frequently had special guests throughout his time leading the lecture.
Recently, he welcomed Jason Momoa on stage, as well as rapper and producer Rick Ross earlier this session, alongside various industry professionals from all facets of entertainment and hospitality.
