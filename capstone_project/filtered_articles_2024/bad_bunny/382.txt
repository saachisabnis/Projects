An investigation. 🧐
Unclear if it’s just us, but we’re starting to miss Bad Bunny just a liiiil too much. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Like, yes, he legit just put out his fifth studio album Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana in October 2023. And yes, he did just wrap up his *chef’s kiss* international Most Wanted Tour in July. 
How-ev-er (!!!!!) we still can’t help but miss his presence—from his red carpet appearances to his on-stage performances. Enter: us legit screaming, crying, throwing up, etc. when he didn’t show up at the 2024 VMAs.
Honestly? Unclear why he didn’t make his way to the ceremony—especially on the heels of him being in New York on September 8 to watch the Men’s Singles Final match between Taylor Fritz and Jannik Sinner—but he’s probs just booked and busy in New Jersey, tbh! 
Now, if you’re all ?!?!?!? at the mention of the Garden State, dw! We’ve got all the deets. On September 10, it was officially announced that the musician joined Adam Sandler’s Happy Gilmore sequel, which is officially in production!
In a September 2023 Vanity Fair cover story, Bad Bunny opened up about his newfound professional pivot and revealed, “You could say that I have been investing a little bit more of myself in acting.” 
He also discussed the projects that intrigued him: “As a movie consumer myself, I’m not one to watch a lot of action movies. I’d even say it’s my least favorite genre. I would really like to play other kinds of things, like a little bit more drama, romance too, or comedy, or [...] a history movie with a little action in it.”
Oh, and BTW, Bad Bunny is in *great* company for the Happy Gilmore sequel since it was revealed on The Tonight Show last month that Travis Kelce will also appear in the film. “Travis has…he mentioned it, so we have a nice something for Travis,” Adam dished before adding, “He’s gonna come by. He’s a very nice guy. You guys would love him in real life. What a big, handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He’s a stud and he’s so funny.”
Literally obsessed with this crossover, tbh.
