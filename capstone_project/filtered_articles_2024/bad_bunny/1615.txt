Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny enjoyed an idyllic night out together in the City of Love amid the hustle and bustle of Paris Fashion Week. 
The 28-year-old model shared a few snaps from the magical night to her Instagram page, romanticizing an evening at the iconic Louvre Museum. The whimsical photo series features Kendall posing by paintings barefoot in a long, black dress as she and her (alleged ex) beau explore the enchanting site that is the world-renowned museum. 
Her caption hinted that the pair were taking in the grandeur of the Louvre at midnight. Does it get more romantic? Other snaps included in the carousel feature various statues, paintings on the ceiling, and even the Mona Lisa! 
While Bad Bunny is not pictured, followers sounded off in the comment section in suspicion of Jenner's photographer with one person stating, "we know who took these picssss." While this is just an assumption, People mentioned that the "MONACO" star was seen walking into the museum with Jenner that evening.
The on-again, off-again duo, who sparked relationship rumors in February 2023 and "split" in December that same year, both made their stamp on this year's Paris Fashion Week; Jenner to walk the runway, and Bad Bunny to perform a few hits. Despite demanding schedules, the icons made time to grab dinner at La Girafe restaurant to rekindle their romance amid precious moments together.
