Netflix is removing more than 200 films and TV shows in January, including its most underrated original title.
The streaming service, as well as adding a bunch of new releases, takes down a large number of titles each month due to the expiration of licencing deals – but it’s now the norm for things that that were released as “Netflix Originals” to be removed, also.
One such casualty in January 2025 is cult British romantic comedy series Lovesick, which was picked up by Netflix in 2018 after being dropped by Channel 4, where it started life as Scrotal Recall.
The high-concept sitcom, created by Tom Edge, centres on a group of English pals living in Scotland, and follows sees Dylan (Johnny Fynn) as he contacts all of his previous sexual partners after being diagnosed with chlamydia 
Each episode focuses on a past love interest of Dylan’s and viewers learn of their encounter via flashbacks.
Below is a full list of everything being removed from Netflix in both the UK and US, compiled with assistance from What’s on Netflix.
