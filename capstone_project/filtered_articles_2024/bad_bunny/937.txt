Your TV GPS, a look at the week ahead in television, appears every Monday morning on BostonGlobe.com. Today’s column covers Nov. 4-Nov. 10.
Goodbye, “Yellowstone” road. The fifth and final season of Taylor Sheridan’s breakout contemporary neo-western is circling its wagons starting Sunday at 10 p.m. on Paramount. Dutton family patriarch Kevin Costner has already ridden off into the sunset to make his multi-part western “Horizon: An American Saga.” Oops, the premiere flopped. Costner, though talented, has an epic penchant for self-sabotage.
The charismatic movie star, brought into this Emmy-snubbed but popular series as a marquee name, abandons a hit show responsible for his career rebirth. The next generations of Duttons (played by terrific ensemble Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, and Wes Bentley), orphans though they may now be, hope to keep the family traditions alive. There are still rumors, though no studio commitments, that a season six may happen without Costner.
What else is coming this week?

2. Discovery launches “Game Changers” Tuesday at 9 p.m. The limited series goes back to the dark ages of gaming — Pong — at the dawn of Atari and the gaming industry. According to the International Gaming Commission, that modest game of back-and-forth spawned what was to become a $184 billion global video game industry in 2023. The eight-part docu-series charts the pastime’s short history, employing archival footage and talking to creators, investors, experts, and players about the intellectual challenges, backstage dramas, and discovery of new frontiers in gaming. Episode 1 charts the rise of Nintendo, a one-time Japanese family business that began over a century ago making playing cards and evolved into a global entertainment giant.

3. While Alan Cumming may never star as a gladiator in a Ridley Scott sword-and-sandal epic, he has conquered pretty much everything else he’s tried. One-man “Macbeth” on Broadway? Done it. Now, with the five-part “Alan Cumming’s Paradise Homes” airing on BritBox Wednesday, the effusive Scottish star with a love for all things tartan enters the shelter show market. Over five episodes, presenter Cumming pokes through houses that fascinate him. Inspired by his love for architecture and design, and in search of the magical and unique, Cumming prowls dream homes, from a private retreat in Mull with 360-degree views and circling golden eagles, to a renovated barn in Northern Ireland, to a home with a naturalistic style that harmonizes with its Swedish island site.

4. On Thursday, Amazon Prime continues to expand its international programming, including spinoffs for the “Citadel” spy franchise spearheaded by the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe. The ambitious project known as The Citadel Cinematic Universe heads to India for the action prequel “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” dubbed and in subtitles. Samantha Ruth Prabhu stars as actress Honey, opposite Varun Dhawan’s stuntman Bunny. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith types get swept up in a spy ring where pulling the trigger isn’t just play-acting. Years later, the estranged pair come together again when their past comes calling — and they must ensure the safety of their daughter Nadia.
5. UFO reporter George Knapp throws down the gauntlet: “We need to get beyond that obvious question ‘Are UFO’s real?’ to what really matters. Why are they here, and what do they want from us?” In “Investigation Alien,” the Netflix series dropping Friday, Knapp goes in search of hard evidence to back up his claims, undeterred by the Pentagon, which only last year declared there was “no evidence” of alien intelligence on earth. Are we alone in the universe or not? Knapp travels the world, highlighting suspicious incidents and interviewing witnesses. The truth is out there, but proof remains Knapp’s holy grail.
