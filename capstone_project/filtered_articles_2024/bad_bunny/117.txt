Bad Bunny took the Oscars 2024 stage to presesnt the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film with Dwayne Johnson. He got the black suit memo like every other man on the red carpet, and he paired it with a pair of rimless librarian glasses and two hands full of rings. The man loves accessories!
The Puerto Rican rapper is regularly showing up and showing out, and Bad Bunny’s Oscars 2024 fashion is about to be no different—especially because it’s his first time attending the Academy Awards. The Oscars is a fashion event as much as it’s a celebration of excellence in cinema, the same way Bad Bunny’s style is part of his overall artistry as much as his music. He’s known for causing a stir with his provocative, gender-bending psychedelic style of dress as much as for Bad Bunny’s thirst traps.
In the past, Benito has made waves for wearing skirts, dressing in drag in his own music videos, and having acrylic nails. He even wore a Louis Vuitton couture skirt on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar. He’s not the first rapper or male musician to play with the hard lines of gender in fashion—it is a tradition amongst cool men in music that spans many decades—but he continues an important legacy in style. Curious to see how Bad Bunny reps that expectation (or subverts it) for the Oscars.
It’s an interesting choice for Bad Bunny to be invited to present at the Oscars, especially because he co-starred in an action comedy in 2022, Bullet Train, with Academy favorite Brad Pitt.
