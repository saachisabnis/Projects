As 2024 draws to a close, we’re taking a moment to look back at the year through the lens of some of Brooklyn Paper’s most thought-provoking, engaging, and downright stunning photos. From historic moments to breathtaking sights, our photographers captured the pulse of Brooklyn in all its beauty.
This year saw Brooklynites celebrating victories and facing challenges together. The New York Liberty’s WNBA Championship win at Barclays Center brought fans to their feet, while the 2024 Mermaid Parade dazzled with its vibrant costumes and wild creativity. And let’s not forget the awe-inspiring solar eclipse, as Brooklyn’s skyline became the backdrop for a celestial phenomenon.
Here are just a few of the unforgettable moments our reporters and photographers have immortalized in 2024:
