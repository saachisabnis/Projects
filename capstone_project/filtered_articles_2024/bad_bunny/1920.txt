Katy Perry, Selena Gomez and more stars have shined a light on what it’s really like to deal with mental health issues in the spotlight.
Being in the public eye is part of the job when becoming a star, but it can make it more difficult to navigate one’s problems. Many stars, however, have used their platform to normalize mental health problems.
From sharing stories of postpartum depression to opening up about anxiety and suicidal thoughts, many of Hollywood’s biggest names have become more vocal over the years about real-life struggles.
Ahead of welcoming her first child with Orlando Bloom, Perry got real about facing bouts of depression and self-doubt in the past during an August 2020 interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. Following her 2017 breakup and Witness album releases, Perry revealed she became “clinically depressed and had to get on medication for the first time in my life.”
The “Roar” singer said she was “so ashamed of it” when she started taking medication. “I was like, ‘I’m Katy Perry. I wrote ‘Firework.’ I’m on medication. This is f—ed up,’” she recalled. The musician later learned how to “quiet it the f—k down” when it came to public criticism and went on a two year “psychological, spiritual, emotional journey.”
In April 2020, Gomez revealed that she has bipolar disorder and explained that by knowing that truth about herself she was able to feel more at ease.
“When I have more information, it actually helps me, it doesn’t scare me once I know it,” the “Rare” singer said on an episode of Bright Minded: Live With Miley. “When I finally said what I was going to say, I wanted to know everything about it and it took the fear away.”
Kristen Bell shared her own mental health journey during an interview on Sunday Today With Willie Geist in November 2019, noting that she felt “incredibly irresponsible” for not speaking out sooner.

“Everyone thinks there’s some shame in it,” the Frozen star said at the time. “I am someone who takes a medication for her anxiety and depression. I am someone who has to check myself and sometimes — if I’m feeling really low — make a checklist of good and bad things in my life to see if it’s my mental state or if we really have a problem. And me talking about that actually came from [my husband, Dax Shepard].”
Demi Lovato, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Jon Hamm have also opted not to hide their issues, instead speaking out about their past demons.

In a January 2024 appearance on Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace, Carey opened up on his years-long battle with depression, which led him to attempt suicide when he was 18 and in his early 20s.
“I think the suicide attempts were calls for help,” Carey explained, adding that the first attempt occurred during a fraternity party. “I was so mad that everybody was having a good time. I remember that. I remember walking down the stairs and everybody’s drinking and I was like, ‘What the hell are they so happy about?’”
 The Price is Right host went on to say he was “angry” the partygoers “were so happy.”
“I was just tired of my life and [thought], who’s gonna miss me?” Carey admitted. “I have a lot of that still. Like, the who’s-gonna-miss-me type of thing. A lot of times I think to myself. Like, if I die, I’m just gonna have my body cremated. No funeral and anything associated with, like, all my mementos and stuff. You can just burn them and give them away. Like, who cares?”
Carey shared he is in a much better place now after spending time in boot camp and through stand-up comedy, however, he still gets depressed “often.”
“But it’s not as bad,” he said at the time. “I mean, just because you’re a celebrity and you have money doesn’t mean bad things don’t happen to you or you don’t have bad days. Everybody’s a person.”

Three years before his death in November 2022 at age 34, Carter opened up on The Doctors about his psychological diagnoses and the medications he was prescribed at the time. The "Aaron's Party" rapper also shared that he had a huffing addiction.
In 2017, the '00s pop star shared with Us that he didn't think he'd live to see his 30th birthday. “I thought I would die by 30,” he said. “Even when I was 13, 14, I thought, ‘Oh, my God. I’m going to die.’”. However, he was looking toward the future with optimism. “My goal is to be the phoenix that rises from the ashes,” he stated.

=The Harry Potter star released his memoir, Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard, in October 2022 and with it divulged his substance abuse struggles. “It came to the point where I would think nothing of having a drink while I was working,” the actor wrote about the difficult time in his life after the franchise had finished filming. Felton ultimately entered rehab three times.
“It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” he penned about the choice to go to a treatment program for the third time. (He left the first one and was kicked out of the second one after being found in a female patient's room.) Felton shared that he hopes his story will help others struggling with the same or similar situations.

When he was 19, the Lord of the Rings star broke his back in a "near-death experience" that saw him fall out of a window. “The months after the fall were quite a dark time," Bloom shared in a video with UNICEF in October 2022, adding, “As somebody who's sort of always been very active in my life, it felt restrictive all of a sudden and I was in a lot of pain.” 
Fortunately, not only did the actor recover physically but he also allowed himself “time and space [during the recovery] for me to look at my life, recognize what was good and great in my life and build that into the way that I lived my life.”

In July 2022, the “Nervous” singer postponed his upcoming live shows in order to focus on his mental health. 
“This breaks my heart to have to say this, but unfortunately I’m going to have to postpone the next three weeks of shows through Uncasville, CT until further notice. I’ve been touring since I was 15 and to be honest it’s always been difficult to be on the road away from friends and family,” Mendes wrote via Instagram at the time. “After a few years off the road, I felt like I was ready to dive back in, but that decision was premature and unfortunately the toll of the road and the pressure has caught up to me and I've hit a breaking point.”

In August 2022, Hill revealed he would no longer be promoting any of his upcoming projects, including his documentary Sputz — which deals with mental health issues — due to press tours and public-facing events “exacerbating” his anxiety. 
“You won’t see me out there promoting this film, or any of my upcoming films, while I take this important step to protect myself,” the Superbad actor explained in an open letter that was published by Deadline. “If I made myself sicker by going out there and promoting it, I wouldn’t be acting true to myself or to the film.”

After revealing that he was “sexually abused as a child” to GQ in an August 2022 cover story, the Mumford & Sons musician went on to detail how he hit “rock bottom” in adulthood after not dealing with the subsequent trauma.
Following an intervention from family and friends, the “Little Lion Man” singer sought psychological help. While discussing what happened to him with a therapist, he began to throw up.
“Apparently, it’s very common,” he told the outlet. “Once you basically unhook the denial and start the process of removing some suppression, then it’s very natural for that stuff to come out. I’d had problems breathing all my life. Not asthma but just, like, catching my breath.”

While filming Thirteen Lives’ underwater scenes in Thailand, Farrell suffered “terrifying” panic attacks.
“I mean, there's a lot to be said for being able to look up in water and see the surface, so when you can't and there's actually a ceiling over your head, and there's no air at all, it just wreaks havoc on my mind,” he told Entertainment Tonight in July 2022.

The America's Got Talent judge, who has Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depression — has long been open about his mental health issues, in part to help erase the stigma.
“We take care of our dental health. We don’t take care of our mental health," the former Deal or No Deal host told Jay Leno in 2014, adding that he believes "the solution to making this world better is if we would just be healthy, mentally.”

“I’ve struggled with this stuff most of my life. I didn’t realize that I was struggling with these things until I was 37, about five years ago and I had a complete mental breakdown,” the Chuck alum admitted during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June 2022. “I was running to lots of other things, whether it was sex or drugs or booze or things to distract me from, to numb myself from the pain that I was running away from most of my life … You’re running back to get more and it just becomes this vicious cycle.”
After Levi suffered a panic attack, which he said was brought on by suicidal thoughts, he decided to enter treatment.
“I was having very active thoughts of ending my life,” he explained. “It wasn’t the first time I had had them. I had been in dark places in my life before, but I guess in those moments I had people around me. I had foolishly, I mean, I think I made the right choice in moving to Austin. I don’t think I did it exactly the right way. I didn’t realize I was running away from so much, but I moved out here and I didn’t have anybody. I didn’t have a support structure.”
Prayer and meditation have since helped the Shazam star cope with his struggles.

“I start my day with Headspace, the app, and that can be like sitting in silence or brushing my teeth,” the DNCE frontman shared during an April 2022 appearance on the “Spout” podcast. “It’s just a way for me to check in with myself before I’m checking on social media or I’m texting people. .... It’s so easy to look at your phone first thing in the morning and be like, 'Oh, I have to do this work thing or I missed this call,’ or like, something’s going on in the world that it’s easy to [get distracted and] make sure to like, just check in with yourself before you check in with anything else.”

The former Fifth Harmony member opened up in April 2022 about her struggle with anxiety, revealing that she was able to deal with it by seeking therapy. "There was a time where my anxiety felt so bad, I was like, ‘I don't feel like I can go in the studio. I don't feel like I can work,’” Cabello told E! News. "And so, the only way for me to go to work every day was to be honest and be myself. And if I didn't go to work and was just waiting for myself to feel better before I did that ... it's just a paralyzing feeling."
The musician, whose third studio album, Familia, dropped the same month, credited therapy as her key to getting her life back. "My life was so bad and so painful that I was like, ‘If you tell me that eating s--t off the ground will make me feel better, I will do it,'" she shared. "I was like, ‘Yes, of course, therapy. All of it.'"
Cabello, who split from Shawn Mendes in November 2021, previously discussed her battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in an essay for WSJ magazine. "My anxiety manifested in the form of obsessive-compulsive disorder," she wrote in May 2020. "OCD can take many different forms, and for me it was obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. To put it simply, it made me feel like my mind was playing a cruel trick on me."
The “Havana” songstress recalled have chronic headaches and a constant inner battle with herself before getting help. "Today I am no longer in that internal war. I feel the healthiest and most connected to myself I’ve ever been, and nowadays I rarely suffer from OCD symptoms,” Cabello concluded. “Anxiety comes and goes, but now it feels like just another difficult emotion, as opposed to something that’s consuming my life."

The model has been open about suffering from anxiety and depression. “It’s important to have a space that’s just for you where you can let out your happiness,” she told i-D in February 2022. “Your anger, frustrations, and stress, the things that are freaking you out, the things that are making you happy and even just ideas.”
She tries to put her thoughts in a journal once or twice a week. She called reading a “great form of therapy and form of distraction,” so she gets engrossed in novels to take her mind off whatever triggered her panic attacks. It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover was a recent read that stopped her mind from spiraling.
Physical activity, whether working out or going for a walk with her dog, helps too. "I think I feel really good mentally when I feel really good physically,” she added. She even meditates and is researching sound healing.

In February 2022, the actor shared a video from June 2021 detailing his decision to stop taking Lexapro after five and a half years. “It’s been crushing, debilitating, just scary honestly,” he said in the clip. “But in this moment, right now, I feel good. I feel f—ing great and it may be fleeting. In an hour, I might be back to where I was but I'm going to bath in normalcy for a moment."
In the caption, Hudson explained, “So this was June 30th of last year. I was in throes of intense anxiety. There were moments, very few, where I felt normal. I was gonna post this then but got nervous that it was too self indulgent and it very well may be but f— k it … I just came upon it and thought I’d share.. #seriousoliver.”

“I think the need to understand what self-care means matters more and more now," the “Juice” rapper told Yahoo! Life in February 2022. “It's not just like, 'Oh, I get pedicures every Sunday.’ ... That's great, that's a start. Real self-care is, like, hard work, you know what I mean? Real self-care isn't just treating 'yo self' or pampering myself.”
Lizzo noted that she often turns to a high-impact workout when she wants to work off her stresses and anxieties, telling the outlet: “Sometimes, the stress that you're feeling, you've got to match that stress with something that's good for you to get it out of your body. Because I know that's what I deal with way more than anything these days, is stress and anxiety.”

“I started taking antidepressants for the first time before my season aired. I thought I knew what to expect,” the former Bachelorette admitted in a January 2022 Instagram message. “I didn’t. I thought I was strong enough to handle the negativity. I wasn’t. But they say time heals everything. If anything, the sparks I once felt for life were doused with the judgement and criticism of not only strangers, but even ones I worked closely with. I was drowning in my tears, unable to even recognize the girl in the mirror. Was the old me really gone?”
She explained how she learned to set better boundaries for herself by unfollowing certain social media accounts and limiting her screen time. With these new developments, she is in a much healthier place.

In January 2022, the "Brave" singer shared photos from a trip to see the Northern Lights via Instagram, and the caption revealed she struggled with depression and anxiety throughout 2021. "It has been a very low year for me with regard to my mental health, and I am also grateful that part of the reason I can touch my joy again is I finally got the help of some medication," she shared in the New Year's post. The Grammy winner continued, "It's been a journey to try and pull up, and I found this year I needed more help. It is helping. I am relieved and feel more like myself- and I will find my way again and now it feels possible. If you're struggling- I see you, and I hope you remember you're not stuck as long as you're willing to change the view. Begin Again."

The “Papercuts” singer got candid with Drew Barrymore during a December 2021 episode of her talk show, in which he admitted he struggled with being vulnerable outside of his music.
“I see a lot of pictures of me and there's, like, smiles on them," he said. "It's just weird, though, because I didn't feel good at all that day and I kind of am sick of smiling on days when I don't feel like smiling. And I feel like this odd pressure because I don't want, like, my fans to think that I'm taking something for granted."
The Dirt actor continued, "So if, like, I accept an award and I'm like, super smiley but behind the scenes … there was, like, stuff going on, or I didn't feel, I don't know, like, a lot of what I do is for other people and I haven't given myself the time to just accept that it's OK to not be OK."

The model took to Instagram in November 2021 to share a clip of Willow Smith discussing feeling "lost" and "confused" alongside several photos of herself crying. She urged followers to take care of their mental health.
"Social media is not real. For anyone struggling, please remember that," she wrote in a lengthy caption at the time. "Sometimes all you’ve gotta hear is that you’re not alone. So from me to you, you’re not alone. I love you, I see you, and I hear you. Self help and mental illness/chemical imbalance is not linear and it is almost like a flowing rollercoaster of obstacles … there is always light at the end of the tunnel."
She hinted at her own struggles with depression and anxiety, adding, "It took me a long time to get that in my mind, but I’ve had enough breakdowns and burnouts to know this: if you work hard enough on yourself, spending time alone to understand your traumas, triggers, joys, and routine, you will always be able to understand or learn more about your own pain and how to handle it. Which is all that you can ask of yourself. Anyways. Not sure why but it feels harder and harder to not share my truth on here. Thank you for seeing me and thank you for listening."

The Fargo star recalled hitting a wall with her depression during her 20s. The “anger” led to Dunst entering a rehab facility and ultimately starting medication. 
“I feel like most people around 27, the s--t hits the fan. Whatever is working in your brain, you can't live like that anymore mentally. I feel like I was angry,” she told The Sunday Times in November 2021. “All I'll say is that medication is a great thing and can really help you come out of something. I was afraid to take something and so I sat in it for too long.”

The rapper reflected on losing her mother in March 2019 after a battle with brain cancer. “I’ve lost both of my parents,” she said on Peace of Mind With Taraji in October 2021, also referring to her father’s death when she was a teenager. “Now I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, who do I talk to? What do I do?’ I just started learning that it’s OK to ask for help. It’s OK to want to go get therapy.”
She continued: “As a Black person, and when you think of therapy, you think of, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m weak,’ you think of medication, and you just think the worst. That’s kind of what you see on TV too; like, therapy wasn’t even presented in the media as something that was good. Now it’s becoming safe to say, ‘All right now, there’s a little too much going on. Somebody help me.’”

Although the singer works hard to stay on top of her mental health, she admitted that returning to antidepressants initially wasn't her first choice.
"I've just been trying to deal day by day. To be honest with you, one of the things that I did — I judged myself a little bit for this, but I got back on antidepressants," JoJo detailed in an interview with Very Well Mind in September 2021. "I wanted to believe that I could clean up my diet, and get out in the sun, and write in my journal, and meditate and do yoga and just be okay. But I needed a little lift."
Looking back on it now, the performer doesn't feel bad about needing "a little help."
"I'm not ashamed that I did that. It was an important turning point for me," she added.

The “Driver’s License” crooner opened up about prioritizing her mental health amid fame during an interview with Vogue Singapore, published in September 2021.
“I’m taking [fame] one step at a time,” the High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star told the magazine. “It can be really tough on your mental health, though. I’m grateful for the people who like me for me, and keep me separated from all the noise and tabloids or what people are saying about me on social media. That’s always been a top priority. It’s funny how recognition changes everything and also changes nothing in your life. The problems I was having a year ago are still the problems I’m having now, and things that brought me joy a year ago are still the things that bring me joy now. It’s just another aspect of life that you need to learn how to deal with, but it doesn’t change who you are as a person."

The Full House alum opened up about how she handles her depression in September 2021. She said in addition to the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, being a working mom and traveling actress can mess with her emotions.
“Really another big part why fitness is important for me is it’s so beneficial to my mental health,” Cameron Bure explained in an interview with The Salvation Army. “I not only juggle my family but also work in a lot of different capacities. It can get really difficult. The travel can get strenuous as well. I need to keep my mental health clear. Just sweating that out and all those endorphins really help me a lot. I notice a huge difference when I don’t exercise, how much it can affect me mentally and kind of deal with depression.”

In a rare interview, Wilson opened up about how struggles from his childhood went unaddressed.
“As a kid, there’s a lot of things that you think about. Death — that kind of landed with me when I was about 11,” the actor explained to Esquire in August 2021. “And I don’t remember ever talking with my parents about it.”
Wilson, who attempted suicide in August 2007, said that he tried to speak with his parents at the time.
“Although I do remember one time saying to my dad — and I remember exactly where in the house — saying, ‘I worry about dying,’ and seeing my dad turn away and catch himself," he recalled. "And I was surprised to see that reaction. But who knows, maybe that was part of why I said it.”
Since then, Wilson shared that he’s in a “lucky place” when it comes to his mental health, "feeling pretty appreciative" now.
"I know everything’s kind of up and down, but when you get on one of these waves, you’ve gotta ride it as long as you can,” he noted at the time. “I’ve just felt — yeah. Feeling pretty grateful. Well, grateful’s one of those words that get used all the time. Appreciative. Of, you know, stuff.”

"When I was told that I couldn't have what I wanted, what I dream of, what I desired, and that was to rap. I was willing to die for it," the Grammy winner recalled during an episode of "Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man" in August 2021, going into detail about attempting suicide when he was 12. "[I] aimed for my heart. How I knew I had mental health problems was I pulled the trigger." Police arrived at the scene, and although the musician was badly injured, he survived. "There is no bar to measure how real. [Mental health is] real," he said. "It's so real that if someone even has the guts, the heart, the bravery, whatever to at least admit that they have something going on up there that they're not sure about, it's so real that we should only react in the realest way possible."

In August 2021, the British actor opened up about how his 2019 stay in rehab was beneficial for his mental health as well as his physical health. “I went through some mental health difficulties after [Game of] Thrones — and during the end of Thrones, to be honest — and I think it was directly to do with the nature of the show and what I’ve been doing for years,” he said during an interview on SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show. “I think I took a sort of break after Thrones where I said, ‘I don’t want to work for a year. I want to really kind of concentrate on myself.' I’m really happy I did that.”
Later that month, he detailed his "traumatic" struggles in an interview with the Sunday Times, sharing that some of his troubles included alcohol. “You get to a place where you feel like you are a bad person, you feel like you are a shameful person. And you feel that there’s no way out, that’s just who you are. And getting sober is the process of going, ‘No, I can change,'" he said of his state of mind before going to rehab in 2019, admitting that he experienced suicidal thoughts. "I will give you an answer to that question: the answer is yes. Yes of course. I went through periods of real depression where I wanted to do all sorts of things. ... I definitely don’t want to be seen as a martyr or special. I’ve been through something, it’s my stuff. If it helps someone, that’s good."

Smith’s May 2021 performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon triggered memories of an anxiety attack she had before a live performance of “Whip My Hair” when she was younger.
"I was doing the Jimmy Fallon performance and I had a flashback of being, like, 10 or 9 and, like, having an anxiety attack on set,” Smith explained on a July 2021 episode of “The Yungblud Podcast” for BBC Sounds. “And basically feeling like everyone around me was just, 'You're just a brat… Why aren't you grateful? You're having an anxiety attack,' but they didn't see it as an anxiety attack. They saw it like a tantrum.”
The “Transparent Soul” singer explained that she needed to “take time” to process those feelings after reliving the attack.
"I need to go into a little meditation," the “Transparent Soul” singer said. "I need to separate myself from the situation a little bit and kind of tell myself, 'You're not 9. You're a grown ass woman.' … And so I have to retrain my mind. So, my mental health is in a very fragile state, but I think it's a state where it's about to grow in a really awesome way.”

The Newsroom alum had a powerful conversation about depression and overcoming suicidal thoughts during a July 2021 appearance on The Demi Lovato Show. "For people who deal with depression, like you and me, and who can have suicidal thoughts, anytime you get to that place and it seems like things are too tough and you just can't take it anymore, just ask yourself if you can hold on another day," Munn told Lovato.
The Oklahoma native noted that if someone takes their own life then it’s “game over” and you’ll never see what could happen in the future. "The pain is really tough. I know, you know. We've been there,” she continued. “But if I had ended my life when I wanted to, there is so much I would have missed. And that's what's worth staying for.”

The gymnastics champion withdrew from both the team and all-around finals during the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
“After further medical evaluation, Simone Biles has withdrawn from the final individual all-around competition at the Tokyo Olympic Games, in order to focus on her mental health,” USA Gymnastics said in a statement at the time. “Simone will continue to be evaluated daily to determine whether or not to participate in next week’s individual event finals.”
After her exit, Team USA went on to earn the silver medal during the team finals, which Biles claimed they might not have earned had she not withdrawn from the competition.
“After that vault, I was like: ‘I’m not in the right headspace, I’m not going to lose a medal for this country and for these girls’ because they worked way too hard for me to go out there and have them lose a medal,” the Dancing With the Stars alum said in a press conference at the time.

The model opened up about her body dysmorphia struggles while she lived at the Playboy Mansion in a candid July 2021 TikTok video.
"So for a recent post, I was looking for pictures of myself in a bunny costume and I came across one. It reminded me of a moment in my life where I was watching a playback of myself in a fashion show and I thought, 'Oh, my God, I need to lose weight,'" Madison explained in the video, alongside a photo of her from 2005. "[I] thought I had gained weight, and thought I hadn't stuck to my diet, and I thought my thighs were huge and I thought, 'I need to lose five pounds at least,’ and that's ridiculous. I look like a stick."
In the video, Madison hoped by sharing her story that others can realize the “off the charts” effects of body dysmorphia.
“It's not worth it,” she continued. “It’s not worth feeling bad about yourself. Like, there are things we all want to improve about ourselves, but it's not even worth taking the time to be miserable.”

The tennis star opened up for the first time in July 2021 after mental health issues caused her to drop out of the French Open two months prior. In an essay published by Time, she wrote that she “felt pressure” to disclose her symptoms at the time and worried that people “did not believe [her].”
Osaka also mentioned that she thinks every athlete deserves "the right to take a mental break from media scrutiny on a rare occasion without being subject to strict sanctions." After saying she wouldn’t do press for the French Open in May 2021, she received a $15,000 fine.
"In any other line of work, you would be forgiven for taking a personal day here and there, so long as it's not habitual. You wouldn't have to divulge your most personal symptoms to your employer; there would likely be HR measures protecting at least some level of privacy," she wrote. "I feel uncomfortable being the spokesperson or face of athlete mental health as it’s still so new to me and I don’t have all the answers. I do hope that people can relate and understand it’s OK to not be OK, and it’s OK to talk about it. There are people who can help, and there is usually light at the end of any tunnel."
The tennis star opened up for the first time in July 2021 after mental health issues caused her to drop out of the French Open two months prior. In an essay published by Time, she wrote that she “felt pressure” to disclose her symptoms at the time and worried that people “did not believe [her].”
Osaka also mentioned that she thinks every athlete deserves "the right to take a mental break from media scrutiny on a rare occasion without being subject to strict sanctions." After saying she wouldn’t do press for the French Open in May 2021, she received a $15,000 fine.
"In any other line of work, you would be forgiven for taking a personal day here and there, so long as it's not habitual. You wouldn't have to divulge your most personal symptoms to your employer; there would likely be HR measures protecting at least some level of privacy," she wrote.

"I am back in Indiana right now because of a breakdown, again, in my life where I don't know what's happening," the season 20 Bachelor admitted to Trista Sutter during a July 2021 episode of her "Better Etc." podcast. "I don't know what this next season of life looks like for me. I'm farther and farther removed from the show, and at the same time, I need to figure out what my life is going to look like and what my legacy is going to be."
The reality star explained that fame altered his mental health over time, but that he was looking forward to a new chapter in his life even if it came with fear.
"It's also really hard," he said. "I'm at a low place, I don't see myself as this thriving figure right now. I'm kind of lamenting and separating myself from a lot of things that I held close."

The Kevin Can F--k Himself star opened up to The Zoe Report in June 2021 about her struggle with depression. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Annie Murphy flew home to Canada right as lockdown orders were set in place. She revealed, “My mom was like, ‘You're crying 12 times a day hysterically, to the point where your teeth are chattering. That's not normal.’” From there, she met with a therapist who diagnosed her with depression. “I was like, ‘Damn it, I'm depressed.”
With the help of regular therapy and antidepressants, the Emmy Award winner revealed she doesn’t cry every day and can focus on other things in her life. She added, “You don't have to be on drugs for the whole time, but they truly, truly saved my life in the sense that I was not a functional human being and I was able to be a functional human being.”

The "Buy U a Drank" rapper revealed in June 2021 that some harsh criticism from Usher caused his mental health to take a negative turn. "Usher was my friend," the Florida native recalled of the 2013 conversation during Netflix's This Is Pop. "I really respect Usher. And he said, 'I'm gonna tell you something, man. You kinda f--ked up music.' ... I chuckled a little bit, it was a nervous chuckle. I didn't understand, you know?"
The comment left a big impression on T-Pain. "That is the very moment, and I don't even think I realized this for a long time," he shared. "But that's the very moment that started a four-year depression for me."

The Deadpool star opened up about his ongoing battle with anxiety as a part of Mental Health Awareness month in May 2021. “One of the reasons I’m posting this so late is I over schedule myself and important things slip. And one of the reasons I over schedule myself is my lifelong pal, anxiety,” Reynolds wrote via Instagram just days before the month ended. “I know I’m not alone and more important, to all those like me who over schedule, overthink, overwork, over-worry and over-everything, please know you’re not alone.”
The Proposal actor concluded: “We don’t talk enough about mental health and don’t do enough to destigmatize talking about it. But, as with this post, better late than never, I hope …”

In a May 2021 interview with Good Morning Britain, the Oscar winner spoke about struggling with depression when she was in her early 20s. "I was 21 and I was rising to success," she recalled. "I know it sounds terrible, but it's a very, very difficult thing — I didn't necessarily want that. Now in doing so, I was very depressed. And I had a lot of these issues where I couldn't even go outside in public. This is something I worked through. I went to a doctor. I went to a psychologist." The Private Benjamin star added that she hadn't really planned to become famous — she originally moved to Hollywood to become a dancer — and was surprised when she became a household name. "Unfortunately, I didn't want to be a big deal," she shared. "I wanted to go home."

The Schitt's Creek cocreator and star opened up about his lifelong battle with anxiety during a December 2020 interview with Bustle, revealing that his mental health struggles came with a few physical side effects. "I think that came from a deep-rooted fear of knowing that I was gay and not being able to be free," Levy said at the time. "By the time I got to high school, when your brain is starting to catch up to your physical impulses, it led to a very confusing time. Because on the one hand, you are now being introduced to things like self-awareness and anxiety. At the same time, you’re becoming more and more savvy when it comes to hiding it."
 
While social situations caused a serious amount of stress, Levy found an escape in school plays. "I was starting to develop a sense of confidence by way of being able to entertain people," he explained. "It was like a decoy version of myself that I was putting out there to not have to live with the reality that when the bullying was happening ... they were speaking the truth."

The Bachelorette alum posted three photos showing her dancing as she marked World Mental Health Day in October 2020. The former beauty queen recalled the time she went to see a doctor before going into her junior year of college, when the physician asked her a simple question: "Are you happy, Hannah?"
"I will never forget that seemingly simple question that came with a heavy answer," she wrote. "I'm the girl that is always wearing a smile! How dare he ask?! But oh, thank God he did."
"'No…. I'm not. I don't even remember the last time I felt happy. And I don't know why. I have reason to be happy, but I just can't really feel it,' I said through broken words passing through the lumps of emotions that had felt indefinitely lodged in my throat," the Dancing With the Stars champ admitted. "I couldn't keep up the act anymore. For years, I silently struggled internally as I was externally championed as the one who always seemed happy. I honestly think that day in the doctor's office was the first time someone asked me if I was indeed, happy."
"Admitting I wasn't okay, and acknowledging my silent, hostage struggle with anxiety and depression through my crocodile tears was a pivotal day for me," she continued. "I have made big leaps of progress in healing and understanding 'its okay not to be okay', with important tools and support to help manage the thoughts and feelings that take over and store within me. But several times in my progress, I have had setbacks; many being the overflow of not observing, in private, the gradual buildup of the hurtful, impactful emotions which consequently spewed into some, more public, relapses of destructive behavior. "
Brown added that it's important to remember that "progress in mental health is a journey with hills and valleys. Our whole world has been through a valley of fear and hurt this year. Be gentle with yourself. Be humble during the process. You aren't going to always get it right and you will make mistakes, but you—just as you are, are enough. You matter. Ask for help. You are worthy of being able to answer the 'are you happy?' question and to say yes, regardless of the circumstances that would usually take your mind and soul captive. You got this. We've got this. You aren't alone."

The Olympic gold medalist spoke out publicly for the first time in October 2020 about her struggles with OCD during an episode of the “Armchair Expert” podcast. "I always thought OCD was I have to touch this x amount of times or I have to do this x amount of times before I leave the room, but I've also learned that OCD is classified with ruminating thoughts or obsessive thoughts or catastrophic thinking," she explained to host Dax Shepard. "I have that and I'm really trying to work on that right now because sometimes our minds go to our worst-case scenario. "
The gymnast revealed that it’s not as easy as simply telling yourself to have a positive mindset. "I feel like for people who don't understand it, they're like, ‘Just don't think about it.' It does not work like that!" she said. "It's so hard because I've been trying to really educate myself on how our minds work just so I can help myself but also just so I can better talk about it and better understand it on a personal level with my family or my friends but also on a public level as well."
The Fierce author has continually tried to educate herself on OCD and chose to discuss her personal struggles in hopes of helping others who suffer from the same thing. "So much of the time, our minds don't really realize what's made up and what's real and that's what I struggle with so much is that fight or flight response where it can be something so small and my body is reacting as if a tiger is trying to eat me," she explained. "In my opinion, it relates to trauma and PTSD. Unless you're getting to the root of the problem of why you are not feeling safe or out of control, you're going to keep having OCD and it's going to manifest into other ways of your life."

Cyrus celebrated the two-year anniversary of her first EP, “Good Cry” in September 2020, and revealed all of the ups and downs she’s experienced since its release. “I’ve been through so much since then. Putting this ep out and going on tour during one of the most depressive times in my life was so hard,” the musician explained via Instagram. “Every day felt like lifting 100lb weights just to get out of bed. The ache in my chest from the pain felt unbearable. At 18 I didn’t think I was going to be here for a 20th birthday soon to be 21. They felt 1000 years away.”
The “Again” singer revealed that she was “so sad, so hurt and so scared” during that time before thanking those who were by her side “during all of my progression and the times where I felt like I was regressing.” Cyrus continued: “Every day is work when it comes to your mental health and personal battles. Not every day is going to be hell and not every day is going to be perfect. I’m still figuring that out. Thank you Cyrens for being patient.” 
The “July” artist thanked her fans for “understanding” how “hard” it was for Cyrus to grow up in the public eye, before going into more detail about how important the EP is to her. “I always have written nothing but the truth and this ep was exactly that. I still stand with needing a good f--kin cry every once in awhile. I know that pain is something we HAVE to feel and experience,” she continued. “I owe this album so much. It tought [sic] me so much about myself... and looking back at myself then to show I am now I just want to run back in time and give that Noah a huge ass hug.. as she was breaking ever so slowly. I’m so happy that I was able to create something that everyone relates to... I turned the pain into something beautiful that others can sing, cry, or smile to and nothing makes me feel more purposeful than that. I love you all thank you so much for everything.”

The Emmy nominee opened up about her struggle with anxiety during a candid interview with Glamour UK in August 2020, noting that staying creative helps change her mood. "When I'm having a bad day or I’m feeling very anxious, some things like when people say, 'Oh, you looked bad at this award show because you looked like this or you looked like that,' those things make me a little bit more anxious and that hinders me a little bit more," she said. "I have learned to manage it in ways that a lot of people learn to manage things like breathing exercises or distracting your mind and my hobbies help distract me from being anxious. ... I have to give myself love because that’s important. Everyone has to empower themselves."

The “Roar” singer revealed during an August 2020 interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe that during her 30s she hit a wall when she was no longer able to fix her bouts of depression by writing songs about her pain. "I broke up with my boyfriend. My expectations weren't met and the world didn't want to hear from me anymore at that moment," she said looking back at the years in her life that “everything changed” for her. "They were like, 'That's enough. Thank you very much. You've given us something and we're good.' And I just couldn't get out of bed for weeks and became clinically depressed and had to get on medication for the first time in my life."
Perry explained that once she was on medication she was “so ashamed of it. I was like, 'I'm Katy Perry. I wrote 'Firework.' I'm on medication. This is f---ed up.'" The singer’s upcoming Smile album gave her the professional and personal comeback she needed.
"The last two-and-a-half years have been a psychological, spiritual, emotional journey of just pulling the petrified poison out of my body and rewiring my neural pathways and that negative thought ticker that keeps coming says, 'You're just lucky. You're just cute. You're not really good. You're not very talented. You're lucky. You're just lucky,' or, 'You're not worth it. You're not good enough. You're getting old. You're fat,' all that s--t," she recalled. "I figured out how to quiet it the f---k down.”

In July 2020, the daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis shared her battle with depression and suicidal thoughts. “A lethal combination of untreated severe chemical imbalance/depression, harmful coping mechanisms and certain debilitating traumas has me questioning if I wanted to continue this life,” she wrote via Instagram. “To have suicidal ideation to me, is to feel there is an unpredictable and unstoppable threat living within your body. In far too often moments, I felt the pain was too overwhelming to keep going. I begged to be saved from my own mind. I am unfathomably lucky that by some unseen force I did not take action on these thoughts.”
Tallulah urged those who are “hurting or questioning harming themselves” to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

I’m introverted, I’m scared, I have social anxiety,” she explained in a YouTube video on her channel. “And through, in particular, playing Captain Marvel, that like kind of wiped clean those titles I had for myself and made me go, ‘Whoa, I’m not really that anymore.’”

“I suffer from depression,” the American Idol alum told Demi Lovato on The Kelly Clarkson Show in June 2020 in the midst of her divorce from Brandon Blackstock. “I think a lot of people, especially in the creative world, or just from childhood, you’ve been kind of trained to, like, just keep going and you can handle it. Especially as a woman, it’s like, ‘Don’t let ‘em see you sweat.’ ... I think that’s a daily thing that you work at and a daily thing that I work at.”

The “Rare” singer has been vocal about her struggles with depression and her mental health in the past, but she revealed in April 2020 that she has bipolar disorder. “Recently, I went to one of the best mental hospitals in the world … And I discussed that after years of going through a lot of different things I realized that I was bipolar,” Gomez admitted on Bright Minded: Live With Miley. “When I have more information, it actually helps me, it doesn’t scare me once I know it … When I finally said what I was going to say, I wanted to know everything about it and it took the fear away.” 
The Disney Channel alum added, “When I was younger, I was scared of thunderstorms and my mom bought me all these books on thunderstorms and she was like, ‘The more you educate yourself on this, the more that you’re not going to be afraid.’ It completely worked. That’s something that helps me big time.”

“I suffer from depression,” the Empire star said in an April 2019 interview with Variety. “My anxiety is kicking up even more every day, and I’ve never really dealt with anxiety like that. It’s something new.” Henson also revealed that she talks to a therapist regularly: “Their job is to make sure you’re mentally sound, whatever that is, and telling you the truth, which might hurt. Sometimes your friends don’t want to hurt your feelings. If I’m going to change for the better, I need honesty, and sometimes your friends and family don’t have it in them to be brutally honest.”
In a December 2019 interview with SELF, Henson elaborated on the telltale signs that she needed help: “I noticed the mood swings — like, one day I’d be up, and the next day I’d be down, feeling like I don’t want to go out in public. Almost agoraphobic, like, ‘Ugh, too much to deal with.’ Feeling really awkward in my skin, feeling out of sorts, and just down, like Debbie Downer, like a dark cloud. And then there would be days where my brain wouldn’t stop racing. I would think of the worst scenarios in the world, which would heighten my anxiety.”

During a revealing interview on Sunday Today With Willie Geist in November 2019, the Frozen 2 star opened up about feeling "incredibly irresponsible" for not being more honest about her mental health struggles in the past. “Everyone thinks there’s some shame in it ... I am someone who takes a medication for her anxiety and depression. I am someone who has to check myself and sometimes — if I’m feeling really low — make a checklist of good and bad things in my life to see if it’s my mental state or if we really have a problem. And me talking about that actually came from [my husband, Dax Shepard] — ugh, I hate to give him credit for everything, it’s so annoying that he’s so right about everything.”

“Sadly, I separated from my lovely first husband [Tony Walton]. And separations were always inevitable and the marriage was over and my head was so full of clutter and garbage. Believe it or not, it was [director] Mike Nichols who really tipped me into wanting to go to therapy,” the Sound of Music star recalled on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in October 2019. “He had been, and he was, so sane and funny and clear. He had a clarity that I admired so much. I wanted that for myself. And I didn’t feel I had it, so I went and got into it, and it saved my life, in a way.”

“I deleted this post earlier, because honestly I’m personally struggling with my mental health right now, and the words I wrote fell flat when I read them,” the Bachelor alum captioned an October 2019 Instagram post. “How could I say these things to others when I didn’t/don’t believe them about myself? I deleted the post, walked to the room down the hall, opened the door, and told Tanner, ‘I’m not OK.’ Lean on those you love, ask for help. You are not a burden.”
Roper went on to tell Us exclusively, “As much as there is so much joy [in motherhood], there’s so much extra that’s sometimes overwhelming. Talk to your loved ones. Let them know what you’re going through because there is help and there is hope.”

The grooming guru said: “I think learning to like your own company and making time to be quiet and spend time with yourself, even if that’s like a morning here or a night there, just having that time to be quiet with yourself, I think is really important.”

Two months after her son Winter’s August 2019 birth, the Grammy winner opened up about her third experience with postpartum depression. “PPD is still a sneaky monkey with a machete working its way through my psyche and body and days and thoughts and bloodwork levels,” Morissette wrote in a blog post. "[I've] been here before. ... The other side is greater than my PPD-riddled-temporarily-adjusted-brain could have ever imagined: as a mom, as an artist, as a wife, as a friend, as a collaborator, as a leader, as a boss, as an activist. I saw how things got richer after I came through it the last two times. I have my eye on that prize again even as I drag my ass through the molasses.”

Duchess Kate and Pippa Middleton’s younger brother, James, opened up about his depression to Tatler magazine in June 2019, explaining that his struggles were in part due to pressures to live up to his famous siblings. "Suddenly, and very publicly, I was being judged about whether I was a success or a failure,” he said. The entrepreneur, who had previously discussed his struggles with the Daily Mail in January, added of his depression, “It’s what keeps you in bed, while anxiety makes you feel guilty for being there. I thought, ‘What do I have to be depressed about?’ I’ve been so lucky with my upbringing, I had all the things I wanted. It’s not that I wanted more, but there was something that wasn’t always there ... And the more I ignored it, the more it was taking over.’”
James said that after undergoing therapy and stepping back from his position at his company Boomf to spend time on brother-in-law James Matthews’ Scottish estate in Glen Affric, he is doing better: “I am happy – I feel like James Middleton again. I feel like I was when I was 13, excited about life. I feel like myself again and I couldn’t ask for more."

The Game of Thrones star opened about her struggle with mental illness on the “Happy Place” podcast in May 2019. “Last year, in my own personal life, I think I just went through a lot of real revelations where I was like I'm not very happy doing this and pretending everything was fine,” Williams explained. “And so, that wasn't a public thing, but after going through that, now I've sort of tried to be a lot more genuine and it just becomes a lot more relaxing after that, I think. You just drop it all and that's when you can really have fun."
Although the British actress has made strides in her mental health journey, she sometimes struggles. ”I still lay in bed at like eleven o'clock at night telling myself all the things I hate about myself,” she noted. “There's still a journey, I think. But at least dropping the act and just being who you truly are, I think that's definitely a first step; not trying to be who you want me to be right now in this moment.”

The “Bounce Back” rapper spoke candidly about his struggles in March 2019 ahead of his 31st birthday. “Around this time last year, around my birthday, it was good for me, but it was wild for me too because I felt like something wasn’t all the way connecting with my energy. I wasn’t feeling like myself and I couldn’t figure out why,” Sean said in a series of Instagram posts at the time. “I stepped back from everything I was doing, from everything I had going on because somewhere in the middle of it, I just felt lost. I started therapy. I got a good therapist. I was blessed enough to talk to some super spiritual people and they made me realize one thing that I was missing in my life. And one thing I was missing was clarity. Clarity about who was around me, what I was doing—even in music, which is my happiness, my joy, that was always an escape for me, was starting to feel like a burden.”

Later that month, a source told Us Weekly Bieber was “going to several doctors” for his personal struggles, clarifying that the “Sorry” crooner was “not in rehab.” The insider added: “He sees a therapist, but he’s not in a special center or anything. He doesn’t want to be dependent on medication. He struggles with ups and downs, anxiety, depression and uncertainty about the future.” The following month, Bieber reached out to fans via Instagram to ask for “prayers” as he’s “been struggling a lot.”

The Modern Family actress revealed in December 2018 that she had suicidal thoughts after she underwent two kidney transplants amid her battle with kidney dysplasia.
“I would write letters in my head to loved ones of why I did it and my reasoning behind it, how it was nobody’s fault. I didn’t want to write it down on paper because I didn’t want anybody to find it. That’s how serious I was,” Hyland told Ellen DeGeneres in January 2019 about contemplating suicide. “I was very, very, very close.”
