Bad Bunnyâ€™s Puerto Rico performance nearly faced an unexpected wardrobe malfunction when his crotch got stuck to another performer onstage.
New footage from the Latin singer-songwriterâ€™s show last night captures the moment he was preparing for an energetic ride when a dancer turned around and began dancing closely with him. 
As she moved, the fabric of her tights became entangled with Bad Bunnyâ€™s pantsâ€”potentially his zipper, although itâ€™s unclear what caused the snag. Some online speculators suggest an arousal, but the footage indicates the fabric being tugged, creating an optical illusion.
In the video (watch below), the stretchy material appears to pull them closer togetherâ€”her lower back to his frontâ€”before she successfully disentangles her tights from his pants. It doesnâ€™t seem like she made accidental physical contact with Bad Bunny, but they certainly got closer than planned.

Bad Bunny handled the situation with humor, laughing it off and moving away from the dancer while gesturing towards his lower body and shaking his head.
Undeterred, Bad Bunny continued his performance, demonstrating professionalism and delivering a great show despite the brief, raunchy interruption.
Bad Bunny has been on tour for several months and has two more shows in Puerto Rico, one tonight (Jun. 9, 2024) and another Sunday (Jun. 10, 2024).
