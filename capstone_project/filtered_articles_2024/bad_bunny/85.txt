MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (WCAX) - This week’s Pets with Potential come from Homeward Bound of Addison County.
Remi and Demi are sisters who staff say hope to get adopted together, but they would be okay in separate homes too. They’re three-year-old hound-retriever mixes who love outdoor time and giving kisses. They’ll do best in a home with a fenced-in yard but also do well on leashed walks. They both love the company of other dogs.
Fig is a petite, affectionate kitty who loves to sit in your lap. She can get overstimulated so she will need a patient family ready to respect her space. She is working on growing out her coat after a bad case of fleas but is ready to move into her new home. She should be the only cat in the home -- and has no experience with dogs
Endi may be only two pounds but by three months old he’s already packing in quite the personality. He hasn’t let an eye injury stop him from being the most charming bunny on the block and shelter staff say he’s always ready to zoom, bounce, and make you laugh.
