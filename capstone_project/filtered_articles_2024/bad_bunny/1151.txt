Bad Bunny was almost caught in a compromising position with one of his dancers. 
During his recent Puerto Rico show, the “Monaco” hitmaker, 30, accidentally wound up with his crotch area caught on one of his dancer’s tights in the middle of his performance. 
According to a video shared online, the dancer walked up to the rapper onstage and turned around to dance on him. 
When she began to shake it on Bad Bunny — born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — the fabric of her tights got caught on his shorts. The snag propelled them back together when she first attempted to get off of the star. 
Shortly after the wardrobe malfunction, the rest of the backup crew covered them from view as they detached from each other. 
Bad Bunny then popped up on the other side of the group, seemingly laughing off the interaction. 
It’s unclear if his rumored lady, Kendall Jenner, was in attendance at this show — though it wouldn’t be surprising considering the couple reportedly rekindled their romance last month after they got cozy together at this year’s Met Gala. 
The “Kardashians” star, 28, was present to support Bad Bunny at several of his shows last month, including his concert in Orlando, Fla.  
They were also seen sneakily exiting their hotel in Miami later that month. 
Jenner and Bad Bunny dated for less than a year before they reportedly split in December 2023.
At the time, a person close to the former couple told Entertainment Tonight that the relationship was never serious.
“They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn’t be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,” the insider claimed.
