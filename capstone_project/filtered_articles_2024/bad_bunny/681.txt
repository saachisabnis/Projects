For fashion and celebrity watchers, there’s nothing like the excitement of the Met Gala guest list and seeing how our favorite A-listers interpret the theme. For 2024, it’s Garden of Time; inspired by the Met Museum’s Sleeping Beauty: Reawakening Fashion exhibition. It will showcase 250 historically significant pieces which are fashion’s ‘sleeping beauties’; garments far too fragile ever to be worn again.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s annual fundraiser for the Costume Institute takes the world by storm with celebs gracing the steps that lead down to Fifth Avenue. However, not everyone can attain an invite just like that. Since 1995, the Met Gala guest list and table seating chart have been curated by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, with only around 600 people making the list each year and a hefty $50,000 donation required to attend.  
The now-iconic event was started in 1948 by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert as a fundraiser for the Costume Institute. In 1973, the Met Gala introduced its first theme, “The World of Balenciaga.” Since then, the event has had dozens of themes that attendees, including actors, singers, models, and social media stars, have had to follow as part of the Met Gala’s dress code, and it’s often pegged to The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Spring Costume Institute Exhibition.
Of course, before all the incredible outfits, the Met Gala guest list is all anyone who cares cares about. Here it is, without further ado, including confirmed and speculated Met Gala guests. 
Status: Confirmed. 
Zendaya is one of four hosts for the Met Gala 2024, so of course, she’ll be there. Whether she’s accompanied by her boyfriend Tom Holland is another question. Unfortunately, his run as Romeo in Romeo & Juliet at the Duke of York’s Theatre in London opens on May 11. 
The Met Gala is on May 6, meaning Tom likely won’t be able to make it. There are usually press previews ahead of productions opening to the public. Sorry to disappoint, stans. 
Status: Confirmed
Chris Hemsworth is the fourth and final (but certainly not the least) host of the Met Gala 2024. The 6’3″ tall drink of Australian water has never been to the event before, but his brother Liam has with his then-girlfriend (or were they married at that point? idk) Miley Cyrus. Will his stunning wife Elsa Pataky join him? It’s pretty likely, as they often walk the red carpet together. 
“This year’s co-chairs reflect a variety of career achievements, and all have distinct style histories with the Met Gala,” Vogue wrote at the time of the announcement. “Rapper Bad Bunny will ring in his third year attending the affair (having delivered an unforgettable backless Jacquemus suit just last year), while actor Chris Hemsworth will mark his very first time at the gala.”
Status: Confirmed. 
Bad Bunny is also hosting the 2024 Met Gala, so yeah obviously he’ll be there. What will be interesting is if his ex, Kendall Jenner, will be there (likely) and if there’ll be any run-ins. The Met Gala guest list is big, but as far as parties go, it takes place in quite an intimate setting. 
In December 2023, it was confirmed Kendall and Bad Bunny had broken up after about a year of dating. “Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,” an insider told Entertainment Tonight. “They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn’t be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go.”
It also comes down to timing. The source explained, “They have crazy-busy schedules and know they’re still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.”

Jennifer Lopez is another host, so she’ll definitely make a dramatic entrance. Whether her husband Ben Affleck will be there is another question. They’ve only attended the event together once before—that was in 2021. That’s not to say he hasn’t expressed his thoughts on her outfits. 
Speaking on Live! With Kelly and Mark in 2023 after the event, she revealed that “He’ll joke with me sometimes, he’ll say things like, ‘Where’s the rest of the shirt?’ or things like that. I’m like, ‘Oh, this one doesn’t have anything else.'” Lol. We’re now officially petitioning for Sad Ben to be among the big names on the Met Gala guest list. 
Status: Rumored but highly likely. 
Rihanna has attended the Met Gala 10 times over the years and has basically stolen the show every time—even in 2023 when she arrived at 10 pm, four hours after the red carpet began and camera crews had begun to pack up. But it was kinda understandable, she was pregnant with her second child with A$AP Rocky. 
Status: Rumored but likely. 
Supermodel Gisele Bündchen has been to the Met Gala 11 times so it’s likely she’ll go again this year. The big difference is that now, she’ll be going without Tom Brady. There’s some speculation as to whether she’ll bring her boyfriend, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. Page Six revealed they were “deeply in love,” in February 2024. 
Status: Rumored but likely. 
After his role in Saltburn, Barry Keoghan emerged as someone with serious fashion bona fides. Page Six reported that the Irish heartthrob has received an invite. Will he and rumored GF Sabrina Carpenter go together? We can only hope. 
Status: Rumored but likely. 
Page Six reported that Kendall Jenner is the only Kardashian-Jenner family member who’s confirmed to have received an invitation. There’s no word on the others but we assume Kim and Kourtney will go. In 2023, Page Six reported that “no Kardashians” were going to be invited but that proved to be wrong. 
Status: Unconfirmed. 
Can you believe Ryan Gosling has NEVER been invited to the Met Gala? We can’t either but something tells us 2024 is the year. He’s become a red carpet darling after his role as Ken in the Barbie movie so we can see this as the perfect opportunity to make his debut on the Met Gala guest list. 
Status: Rumored but likely. 
It’s also been a stellar couple of years for The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, who swept the awards season for her role as Sydney in the hit FX show. According to Page Six, the beloved Edebiri has received an invite to the event but we haven’t had a confirmation that she’ll attend.  
Status: Rumored but likely. 
Golden Globe winner and Oscars nominee Lily Gladstone has had an incredible past 12 months, with her breakout role in Killers of the Flower Moon elevating her to A-lister status. Page Six reports Gladstone has made it to the Met Gala guest list 2024, but whether she’ll actually go is still up for debate. 
Despite heavy speculation, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift won’t be attending, despite landing a place on the Met Gala 2024 guest list. According to TMZ, the couple were invited but declined. “We know Taylor has a pretty good reason for skipping the event, which takes place on May 6—that’s the same week she gets back on the road for her ‘Eras’ tour with a stop in Paris,” the tabloid reported, adding that it was unlikely Travis would go on his own. It’s a shame because they haven’t walked the red carpet at any event yet despite the public nature of their relationship. 
Country star Kelsea Ballerini is confirmed to be in attendance at her first Met Gala, having shared to Instagram stories on the morning of May 6 that she was getting ready. Whether her boyfriend, Outer Banks star Chase Stokes will be there too remains to be seen. 
In the week leading up to the event, Bella Hadid was dropping all sorts of clues that she’d be on the Met Gala guest list. Her stylist Molly Dickson shared several outfits that were botanical in nature, seemingly nodding to the 2024 theme Garden of Time. 
Emma Chamberlain seemingly confirmed she’d be on the Met Gala guest list during an interview at Paris Fashion Week. When asked: “Will we see you at the Met next?” she replied, “YES, hopefully yes.”
All eight members of the world-class K-pop sensation group Stray Kids were announced to be on the Met Gala guest list on the morning of the event—and that they’d be styled by Tommy Hilfiger. The group created a cohesive Classic American Cool look in keeping with this year’s theme while staying true to the brand’s signature red, white, and blue color palette with rich gold accents.
