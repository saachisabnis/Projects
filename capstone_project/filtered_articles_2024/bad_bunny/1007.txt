Already one of the most successful and prolific Latin music artists in Boxscore history, Luis Miguel has re-entered the record books with his ongoing world tour. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, the Luis Miguel Tour 2023-24 has grossed $318.2 million and sold 2.2 million tickets in its first 146 shows. That makes it the highest grossing tour ever among Latin acts.

	At an Aug. 28 show in Caracas, Venezuela, Miguel slid past Bad Bunny’s World’s Hottest Tour ($314.1 million) and Karol G’s Manana Sera Bonito Tour ($313.3 million) for the Latin Boxscore record and extended it a few days later with a concert in Juarez, Mexico.

	Miguel’s current tour kicked off with a bang last summer, with 10 shows at Buenos Aires’ Movistar Arena, and then another 10 at the venue of the same name in Santiago, Chile. Those 20 kick-off dates brought in a combined $28.1 million and sold 227,000 tickets, already establishing it as the third highest grosser of his storied career. After that, he toured through the U.S., Mexico and Latin America, back to the U.S., over to Spain, and most recently, back to LatAm.

	Miguel’s run in the U.S. was fruitful ($49.8 million), but the turn to his native Mexico was even bigger, bringing in $57.5 million in 20 shows. By the end of 2023, he had earned $141 million – still a way’s away from the all-time high, but enough to handily pass his own Mexico Por Siempre Tour from 2018-19 ($101.4 million) as his biggest tour yet.

	Across stadiums in Latin America, Miguel added another $73 million in the early months of 2024, and another $65.6 million in North American arenas through mid-June. Twelve shows in Spain packed in $27.6 million, and his return to Central America padded the tour with another $10.7 million in five shows in August.

	Not only is this Miguel’s highest-grossing tour, it’s his best-seller. At 2.194 million tickets so far, he has doubled (and then some) his previous run, where he moved 965,000 tickets. On the all-time leaderboard, he still trails Karol G’s 2.326 million, though he will easily pass that mark by the end of the month.

	While Bad Bunny and Karol G had earned their all-time highs exclusively in stadiums around the world, Luis Miguel has mixed arenas and stadiums, with more than double the show count. 

	Already in unprecedented waters, Miguel has played another seven as-yet-unreported shows in Mexico and Las Vegas, with another 30 scheduled in Mexico through Nov. 25. The centerpiece of his remaining shows is a 10-show run at Mexico City’s Arena Ciudad de Mexico between Oct. 8-24. Seven shows at the same venue grossed $14.6 million last November, so his extended stint is expected to surpass that and be the entire tour’s biggest engagement.

	Miguel’s 20 shows in Mexico last year averaged $2.873 million per date. Applying the same logic, the remaining dates (including September shows that he has played but not yet reported) could add another $100 million and make him the first Latin artist to stage a $400 million tour.

	Dating back to a November 1991 concert at New York’s The Paramount, Miguel has grossed $633.1 million and sold 6.3 million tickets over 701 reported shows.
