The June 3 episode of WWE RAW will feature three big matchups. 
This week’s episode of RAW featured plenty of movement in multiple storylines. As a result, three singles matches were announced for next week’s show. 
The Priest versus Mysterio match was booked as a result of Judgement Day’s interference during Mysterio’s May 27 win over Carlito on RAW. Check out full WWE RAW results here. 
WrestleZone spoke with Damian Priest and Finn Balor about their respective work as singles and tag team competitors. Finn Balor said his NXT Championship loss to Samoa Joe at an NXT live event was his favorite match because it made him feel so alive in the ring.
Finn Balor: “Great question. I’m just gonna go with my favorite match of my career. I don’t know if it necessarily represents my work the best, but the emotion I felt in the match in Lowell, Massachusetts on a house show against Samoa Joe where I lost the NXT Championship was one of the most alive feelings I have felt in a ring. That for me certainly sticks out about one of my favorite moments from my career.”
Damian Priest followed, and he chose his street fight against Bad Bunny at WWE Backlash 2023.
Damian Priest: “For me, it was Puerto Rico versus Bad Bunny. A match that exceeded just the idea of what we do as a profession. That was more of a cultural representation, a moment for me which is way more important. And that for sure, is something I get to represent what I love to do as my job, as a WWE Superstar, and also get to do something that I love as a representative of humanity and my culture. So that was definitely by far my favorite.”
