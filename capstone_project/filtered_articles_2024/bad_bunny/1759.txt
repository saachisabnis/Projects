The 1996 Adam Sandler comedy "Happy Gilmore" is returning for another round, and though its sequel may be in early development, the film is already racking up an all-star cast.
The golf comedy, slated to release on Netflix, will be a reunion for Sandler and his co-stars Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald, who are slated to reprise their roles. Bowen played Virginia Venit, a PGA Tour publicist-turned romantic interest for Happy, and McDonald portrayed the cocky pro golfer Shooter McGavin who attempts to thwart Happy's meteoric rise out of jealousy.
Carl Weathers, who died in February, rounded out the cast of the cult favorite film, which also featured appearances from the likes of "The Price Is Right" host, the late Bob Barker; the late comedian Joe Flaherty and golf legend Lee Trevino.
Kyle Newacheck will direct, and the 1996 version's director, Dennis Dugan, will be one of the executive producers.
