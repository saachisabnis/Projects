Bad Bunny has dominated the charts for the last six years, delivering albums like Un Verano Sin Ti and releasing hits like “Mia” with Drake. Through this period, he’s experimented with a variety of flows and styles, which has allowed him to create everything from “Where She Goes” to “Dakiti” with Jhay Cortez. Now, as he embarks on his latest tour, it appears the Puerto Rican star is ready to try out something else.
“Now I want to do other things. And now more [because] there’s [other] movements in each country. Back in the day, it was only Puerto Rico in a corner— not anymore,” he told Complex.
“Now there’s a lot of people from different countries where a bunch of different talents are emerging.”
While some would be afraid to break away from what’s worked in the past, Bad Bunny is leaning into change and appears to be having fun as he tries out new sounds.
“I think what’s happening is really cool, but I generally don’t know where I see myself right now, but it’s not here,” he continued, according to Complex.
“There’s a lot I want to do, a lot of music left to explore. A lot of heart.”
Bad Bunny will have more time to explore what’s out there for him musically once he wraps up the Most Wanted Tour. The final show is set to take place on Sunday, June 9 at Coliseo de Puerto Rico.
