If you want to bag a bargain on your next order at McDonald’s, you’ll have to be quick.
That’s because today (Monday, March 11) only, the fast food chain is giving customers up to 50% off two popular menu items.
For just one day, you can get the Breakfast Roll and six-piece Chicken McNuggets box at a reduced price when you buy through the MyMcDonald’s App.
The roll, which normally costs £3.39, will be available for £1.99 – that’s a 30% discount. Not bad given it contains a filling combination of a pork patty, egg, bacon and cheese, along with your choice of ketchup or brown sauce.
Meanwhile, the McNuggets are half price, down from the standard £4.69 to just £1.39 in the deal.
To add to the offer, you’ll earn points on the app, which can be redeemed for free items and money off. 
Every penny spent with MyMcDonald’s equals one Rewards point, meaning your Breakfast Roll order will rack up 199 points and your six McNuggets nets you 139.
You’ll need 1,500 points before you can redeem them, with rewards in this tier including a free small fries, medium salad, regular drink (including McCafe), or mini McFlurry.
This promotion is part of the Daily Offers on the McDonald’s app, where you’ll spot the cut-price Breakfast Roll from 5am to 11am and the McNuggets from 11am onwards.
Unfortunately you won’t be able to order the beloved McCrispy, as this comes back to the menu as of Wednesday, March 13 alongside the brand’s Easter offering.
Also making a comeback are halloumi fries with a tomato dip (£2.79), plus the iconic Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry (£2.19), which sees soft dairy ice cream swirled with pieces of Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate and topped with a Creme Egg sauce.
