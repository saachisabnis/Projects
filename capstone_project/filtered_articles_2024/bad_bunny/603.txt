If you’re obsessed with Bad Bunny, hello and welcome! We’re *also* here to stan. Bad Bunny (aka Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) has become a household name in every part of the world thanks to his super-catchy songs and completely epic shows—and he does it all on his terms. 
As he told Trevor Noah, “People can feel me. I’m Latino; I’m Puerto Rican. Yo soy de Puerto Rico. People can feel that, you know? No matter…no importa de tu sea, lo vas sentirlo, como que, why do I have to change? Nadie le pide a una artista gringo que cambien. No one has told a gringo artist that you have to change. People love your music. This is who I am. This is my music. This is my culture. If you don’t like it, don’t listen to me. If you like it, you know.”
 And since Benito starred in 2022's Bullet Train alongside Brad Pitt, he can go ahead and add “blockbuster movie actor” to his list of achievements…along with “millionaire” because he’s been making some serious money as of late.
That would be $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth (side note: this figure is a whopping $32 million more than what it was in 2022). And, I mean, it def helps that in 2020, he was Spotify’s most streamed artist globally (with 8.3 billion streams) and has collected tons of Grammys and broken countless records since. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Like, Bad Bunny’s album YHLQMDLG was also the most streamed album of 2020, *and* his album Un Verano Sin Ti was named the number one album of the year by Time. Not! To! Mention! His latest album Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana became last year's most-streamed album in a single day on Spotify. Casual.
Also, keep in mind that $50 million is what Bad Bunny has in the bank after taxes and expenses, meaning he’s actually made wayyyyyYYYyyYYyYYyy more than this.
According to Forbes, most of this came from his tours (which we’ll get to in a moment after we collectively 😱 at his annual income) as well as endorsements from Corona, Cheetos, and Adidas. 
Tragically, a reliable outlet hasn’t confirmed this information (rude), but there *are* unverified claims that Bad Bunny took home about $150,000 for his part. And this obviously wasn’t his first time acting. Bad Bunny was also in Narcos: Mexico, although his salary for that role is unknown as well. 
His World’s Hottest Tour pretty much consistently sold out and pulled in massive (!!) amounts of money. Forbes, which called Bad Bunny the “biggest concert draw in music in 2022” reported that tickets in LA were selling for ~$600 through resellers. And according to Pollstar’s data, Bad Bunny also made $120.1 million in box-office revenue for his El Último Tour del Mundo. 
“It had such unprecedented success in terms of being one of the fastest- and highest-selling tours of all time, breaking records left and right,” Bad Bunny’s music agent at UTA, Jbeau Lewis, told Pollstar at the time. “There were situations where we would sell out one of the arenas and we would know that there were 200,000 or 300,000 people still waiting in the online queue to try and buy tickets. We were able to extrapolate that data to know how many more tickets we could have sold had they simply been available.” 
Aaaand, the man still continued to tour throughout much of 2024. Back in February, Benito embarked on his Most Wanted Tour, which pretty much sold out as soon as it was announced. If his past tours are any indication, Bad Bunny totally raked in a ton of $$$$$$ for this one, too.  
Yep, you read that correctly. Adam Silvera’s They Both Die at the End made history as the first YA novel with queer Latine characters to hit No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, and now, Netflix won a *highly* competitive bid to bring it to life onscreen. 
According to a January 2023 report by Deadline, Bridgerton creator Chris Van Dusen and Yellowjackets executive producer Drew Comins are working on the series alongside Bad Bunny, who’s set to produce. Translation: He will also make hella bank from the screen adaptation of the super successful book. 
 The man is multifaceted—he appeared as the host and musical guest on SNL in October 2023 in support of his most recent album, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana. There are no official reports on how much hosts make on the series, but according to The Things, SNL’s hosting rate ranges from $25,000 per episode to $525,000 per year. 
Justin Timberlake—who’s hosted the show a few times—dished that he only made $5,000 per appearance. “This was my third time to host and obviously I’ve done some appearances here and there when I’m in town...I really do adore the cast and the writers and everyone there,” he said, per The Things. “And it’s…you know…it’s a great opportunity for an entertainer like myself to...it’s the best minimum…It’s the best five grand you can make on television. It’s awesome.” Good! To! Know!!!
And he makes an estimated $100,000 per appearance in the ring. Plus, there’s his merch sales. According to Fightful Select, Bad Bunny drove more than $500,000 in merch sales to WWE during their first run.
And speaking of merch, let’s end our time together contributing to Bad Bunny’s net worth by buying this T-shirt, ‘kay? ‘Kay!
This isn’t even shocking considering the singer was quite literally the first Latino artist to headline Coachella in April 2023! Just how much, you ask? Reports estimate that Bad Bunny earned a whopping $5 million for the gig, which is definitely up there with other artists who have headlined the music festival in years past.
