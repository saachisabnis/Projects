People can get creative with their lawn ornaments when it comes to Christmas, but JP Michalik may have taken that to the extreme.
Nothing says Christmas more than the classic film "A Christmas Story", the film famously remembered for the danger of shooting one;s eye out when they get a BB rifle, is also well known for the classic scene where the leg lamp was revealed. The lamp that depicts a women's leg in 6inch heels and garters was for a long time the symbol of male bad taste in decorating, well now Michalik has stepped it up a notch.
JP has erected a giant replica of the leg lamp from "A Christmas Story." and placed it in front of his house. The lamp is 20 feet tall, with a replica of Ralphie hugging the lamp, wearing his pink bunny suit.
"Everyone's decorating their, their houses and I, I thought it'd be fun to have, like, a, like a neighborhood, like, competition who could have like, the best, uh, Christmas decorations," Michalik said.
Like it or not, garters and stripper heels are now a part of Christmas in America.
