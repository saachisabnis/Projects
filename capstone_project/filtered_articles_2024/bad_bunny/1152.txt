There’s nothing in the Bible that says pranking children is bad, so a holiday involving eggs and a mythical bunny is the perfect time to test the waters of what a kid can handle. Redditors suggest simple pranks — for instance, supergluing the eggs in their hiding spots — that you can use as a starter. After that, maybe work your way up to more diabolical plots, like filling Cadbury eggs with mayo. 
Either way, these are the funniest ways Redditors have tricked children on Easter, and hopefully these kids will carry on the tradition when they reach adulthood.
