* Rich is taking the morning off, but he asked me to give out the awards today…
* The 2024 Golden Horseshoe Award for Best State Agency Director goes to  Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Director Kristin Richards…

Krisitin Richards is a force who understands government in and out. You need someone like her running an agency where complicated deals with the private sector rely on someone who can bridge the gap between the antiquated and complicated state government systems and large corporations. Kristin is the best at what she does, and it shows in all the successes the state has racked up.

* The 2024 Golden Horseshoe Award for Best Statewide Staffer goes to Anne Caprara…
Anne’s ability to bring together the best people in State Government is unmatched. Look at her lineup of talent in the Gov’s Office. Anne’s strategic advice around policy, communications, legislation and yes politics has been the guiding light for the Governor’s Office for the past six years. Speech Writing - Check (See Pritzker’s Northwestern Commencement Address), Public Speaking - Check (Her panel discussion post election at the City Club was heartfelt and inspiring) and Tenacity - Check (Pritzker has publicly given Caprara credit for organizing and going after the DNC in Chicago). If you dont know - Anne - you should - she is one of the most inspiring people you will ever meet.

Congratulations!
* On to today’s categories…
Best Statewide Officer

Please explain your nominations or they won’t count. Also please nominate in both categories. Thanks! 
* A reminder! We’re shutting down for winter break on Friday, but there’s still time to help LSSI bring joy to children in foster care. While we won’t be here to nudge you, your support can make a world of difference.
These kids have faced so much chaos in their lives. A simple gift can bring them comfort and remind them they’re cared for.
Let’s spread some love and light this holiday season. Thank you for being part of this effort! Please click here and donate if you are able…

-  TJ - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 9:11 am:  US Rep - Eric Sorensen.  Reelected in an actually competitive district, rather than being gifted cakewalk, and absolutely knee-capped his opponent in a brutally effective takedown of an ad to such a degree that I hope he eventually gets a position with the DCCC leadership directing ads for others.
Statewide - Pritzker really by default.  Everyone else seems like background noise, and I won’t consider Alexi given how bad the ILSOS site has gotten since he’s taken over (and yes, that’s the basis for my dislike of him,).  His ability, or lack thereof, to block the worst excesses of Trumpism in Illinois is going to be the story of the state for the next two-four years.

-  The Real Bruce Rauner - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 9:39 am:  Eric Sorensen- He has done a great job in trying to represent the values of his district in one of the few competitive districts in Illinois. 
Statewide- Treasurer Micheal Frerichs, he is doing a yieldman’s job in trying to return Illinoisans back their unclaimed property and helping local units of government through IL Funds and E-Pay.



-  SEIU (Retired) - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 10:17 am:  Raja for US Rep.  Good constituent services.  Good fundraiser and waiting for his opportunity to move up.
For Statewide, I agree 100% with TJ on Alexi.  Wish he never came back into the picture.  The complaints I hear about his people at SOS are unbelievable but apparently true.  I’ll go with Mendoza.  She is all over the state and shows a real caring in every region of the state.



-  Joe Bloe - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:10 am:  Robin Kelly gets my vote. She works extremely hard to represent ALL of her constituents –urban, suburban and rural, from Chicago to Danville- which isn’t easy. She is bipartisan, empathic to people’s real needs, and passionate about improving public safety, healthcare and economic opportunities. Don’t underestimate her tenacity just because she’s nice. And her casework team rocks.



-  Joe Bloe - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:11 am:  Statewide: It has to be the Governor.



-  Rich Miller - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:14 am:  Don’t bother posting without an explanation because they will not count.



-  SBA_618 - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:26 am:  Best U.S. Representative- Nikki Budzinski because of her constant drive to bring people together and get things done.  When the rubber hits the road, Nikki is likely either behind the wheel or in the car! She has been dedicated to being a hands-on legislator while also establishing herself as a leader within DC. 
Statewide Officer- Governor JB
JB Pritzker has proven he stands up for what is right in tough times.  He is not one to take advantage of a headline for personal gain. He is a hard worker and appreciates when others work hard to advocate for progress.  I know he truly cares about doing his job well and surrounding himself with others who share that goal.



-  redbird - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:31 pm:  I wholeheartedly agree with SBA_618 regarding Congresswoman Budzinski. She is adept at getting things done in DC for her district and for the state of Illinois. She probably should be mentioned in articles about possible successors to Senator Durbin. 
And ditto regarding Governor Pritzker. Dude is the Energizer Bunny.



-  Mike Murphy - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:42 pm:  My top pick for the best U.S. Representative is Nikki Budzinski. Her dedication and ability to collaborate with people from all walks of life are truly refreshing. She’s a hard worker who has built a highly responsive team in both her D.C. and District offices.
Statewide, my choice is the Governor. While I believe there’s still room for improvement, he has done commendable work in attracting businesses to Illinois.



-  47th Ward - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:44 pm:  I’ll nominate Mike Bost for best US Representative. He sent Darren Bailey back to Xenia as a private citizen, hopefully for good. He groveled enough to earn the endorsement of the only Republican that matters, and now is poised to serve in the Majority (hopefully not for long). Bost was shooting dogs before Kristi Noem made it fashionable. There really is nothing despicable and cruel that they can’t turn into a political selling point. Who knows? Maybe Bost can be Speaker of the House in 2025? His arrow is pointed up in Congress. 
For best Statewide office holder, I’m going with LG Juliana Stratton, who seems to be everywhere all of the time. At least judging by my FB feed. The Governor has been very supportive of her, including her in things previous LGs could only dream of. Yes, she doesn’t have statutory duties or responsibilities, but she works hard and turning nothing into something on a regular basis.



-  Chicago area advocate - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:13 pm:  Best US Representative: Lauren Underwood. She is active in her community and Washington alike. She connects with and supports constituents across the ideological spectrum, deservedly outperforming other Democrats by significant margins electorally. In Washington, she is focused on major initiatives, including on Black maternal healthcare, and has a proven track record of working across the aisle to pass meaningful legislation, something that will be critical in the coming years. Not only that, but Congresswoman Underwood is a strong supporter of growing our party and engaging the next generation — she uplifts local candidates through her Farm Team PAC, and is even a big part of why I became politically involved. We need more Democrats like Underwood who focus on uplifting others and true public service.
Best Statewide Officer: I have to go with JB Pritzker. He has seamlessly brought progressive leadership to Illinois, explaining policies in a way that is clear, palatable, and persuasive.



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:20 pm:  Chuy. This man is a living legend. Brings home the bacon and his mayor’s love him, even the Republicans. Electorally, one one of the strongest electeds in the country. He outran Harris by 12 pts!



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:23 pm:  Statewide, let’s go with Kwame. His leadership has made a tangible impact in protecting Illinois families. Kwame is nationally respected by his peers. Quietly doing the work



-  Pot calling kettle - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 2:39 pm:  I second the Underwood nomination.  For better or worse, Rep. Underwood gained the upper portion of the Illinois Valley during redistricting.  This was to the benefit of that area because her constituent services and personal outreach have been well above recent experience.  She visits the region frequently to highlight her work and solicit input and requests for support.  It is clear that she truly wants to know about the issues facing communities large and small and she and her staff work with whoever comes forward to help them.  She has numerous town halls in every county, recruits local leaders as moderators, answers all questions (and, there have been some out there ones), and then returns during the next recess.  The area has not seen that level of interaction for decades.  On top of that, Underwood provides leadership and support for the Dems - her Farm Team PAC, which supports local candidates is just one example.
For state-wide officer, I nominate the Auditor General Mautino.  Most of what he and his team do is behind the scenes, but it is vital.  Throughout the year, they report on the good, the bad, and the ugly, which allows the agencies, the General Assembly, and the other state-wides to identify and address areas in need of improvement.  Mautino’s depth of understanding about state government allows him to assist anyone who asks “what,” “why,” “which,” and other questions about the various machinations of state government.  Mautino’s demeanor suits the position well.



-  Birds Aren’t Real - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 3:17 pm:  I have to nominate Rep. Lauren Underwood! She’s an effective policymaker and always working to reach her constituents. With the change in DC, she’ll be an EFFECTIVE advocate for Illinois.
For statewide: JB Pritzker for standing up for Illinois and protecting us from attacks we should expect from the federal government.



-  femininomenon - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:33 pm:  Lauren Underwood - She’s approachable, a hard worker and reliable- all things you want in a Congressperson.  
JB Pritzker - “You come for my people, you come through me”.  No truer words have been spoken.  The Governor has stood up for Illinois residents since day one on the job.  He has brought new jobs; economic growth opportunities and more credit upgrades than any other Governor in the history of the state.  He has been proactive on  reproductive and human rights. My personal favorite thing about the guy is he truly enjoys his job and it shows.



-  Justin - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:49 pm:  US House: I nominate Nikki Budzinski (D) from IL-13. She has an excellent pulse on the district that sprawls from Cahokia to Alton to Springfield to Champaign.
Statewide: I nominate Gov. JB Pritzker (D). He has improved Illinois by leaps and bounds ever since he came into office and dealt with challenges along the way.



-  Shytown - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 5:08 pm:  Member of Congress – Nikki Budzinski all the way. She is a nose to the grindstone, get things done, collaborator who knows how to bring people together. I appreciate her work give a voice to rural America and through the lens of a Democrat (and there are fewer and fewer Dems representing rural spaces today).
Statewide officer – Governor Pritzker for the win. Look at this state today. You can’t even recognize it from nearly six years ago when he was sworn in. The state got its groove back and then some thanks to his leadership - business, economy, human rights, health care. Excited to see what else he and his team have up their sleeves.



-  The Real Bruce Rauner - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 9:39 am:  Eric Sorensen- He has done a great job in trying to represent the values of his district in one of the few competitive districts in Illinois.

He is a hard worker and appreciates when others work hard to advocate for progress.  I know he truly cares about doing his job well and surrounding himself with others who share that goal.



-  redbird - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:31 pm:  I wholeheartedly agree with SBA_618 regarding Congresswoman Budzinski. She is adept at getting things done in DC for her district and for the state of Illinois. She probably should be mentioned in articles about possible successors to Senator Durbin. 
And ditto regarding Governor Pritzker. Dude is the Energizer Bunny.



-  Mike Murphy - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:42 pm:  My top pick for the best U.S. Representative is Nikki Budzinski. Her dedication and ability to collaborate with people from all walks of life are truly refreshing. She’s a hard worker who has built a highly responsive team in both her D.C. and District offices.
Statewide, my choice is the Governor. While I believe there’s still room for improvement, he has done commendable work in attracting businesses to Illinois.



-  47th Ward - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:44 pm:  I’ll nominate Mike Bost for best US Representative. He sent Darren Bailey back to Xenia as a private citizen, hopefully for good. He groveled enough to earn the endorsement of the only Republican that matters, and now is poised to serve in the Majority (hopefully not for long). Bost was shooting dogs before Kristi Noem made it fashionable. There really is nothing despicable and cruel that they can’t turn into a political selling point. Who knows? Maybe Bost can be Speaker of the House in 2025? His arrow is pointed up in Congress. 
For best Statewide office holder, I’m going with LG Juliana Stratton, who seems to be everywhere all of the time. At least judging by my FB feed. The Governor has been very supportive of her, including her in things previous LGs could only dream of. Yes, she doesn’t have statutory duties or responsibilities, but she works hard and turning nothing into something on a regular basis.



-  Chicago area advocate - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:13 pm:  Best US Representative: Lauren Underwood. She is active in her community and Washington alike. She connects with and supports constituents across the ideological spectrum, deservedly outperforming other Democrats by significant margins electorally. In Washington, she is focused on major initiatives, including on Black maternal healthcare, and has a proven track record of working across the aisle to pass meaningful legislation, something that will be critical in the coming years. Not only that, but Congresswoman Underwood is a strong supporter of growing our party and engaging the next generation — she uplifts local candidates through her Farm Team PAC, and is even a big part of why I became politically involved. We need more Democrats like Underwood who focus on uplifting others and true public service.
Best Statewide Officer: I have to go with JB Pritzker. He has seamlessly brought progressive leadership to Illinois, explaining policies in a way that is clear, palatable, and persuasive.



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:20 pm:  Chuy. This man is a living legend. Brings home the bacon and his mayor’s love him, even the Republicans. Electorally, one one of the strongest electeds in the country. He outran Harris by 12 pts!



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:23 pm:  Statewide, let’s go with Kwame. His leadership has made a tangible impact in protecting Illinois families. Kwame is nationally respected by his peers. Quietly doing the work



-  Pot calling kettle - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 2:39 pm:  I second the Underwood nomination.  For better or worse, Rep. Underwood gained the upper portion of the Illinois Valley during redistricting.  This was to the benefit of that area because her constituent services and personal outreach have been well above recent experience.  She visits the region frequently to highlight her work and solicit input and requests for support.  It is clear that she truly wants to know about the issues facing communities large and small and she and her staff work with whoever comes forward to help them.  She has numerous town halls in every county, recruits local leaders as moderators, answers all questions (and, there have been some out there ones), and then returns during the next recess.  The area has not seen that level of interaction for decades.  On top of that, Underwood provides leadership and support for the Dems - her Farm Team PAC, which supports local candidates is just one example.
For state-wide officer, I nominate the Auditor General Mautino.  Most of what he and his team do is behind the scenes, but it is vital.  Throughout the year, they report on the good, the bad, and the ugly, which allows the agencies, the General Assembly, and the other state-wides to identify and address areas in need of improvement.  Mautino’s depth of understanding about state government allows him to assist anyone who asks “what,” “why,” “which,” and other questions about the various machinations of state government.  Mautino’s demeanor suits the position well.



-  Birds Aren’t Real - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 3:17 pm:  I have to nominate Rep. Lauren Underwood! She’s an effective policymaker and always working to reach her constituents. With the change in DC, she’ll be an EFFECTIVE advocate for Illinois.
For statewide: JB Pritzker for standing up for Illinois and protecting us from attacks we should expect from the federal government.



-  femininomenon - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:33 pm:  Lauren Underwood - She’s approachable, a hard worker and reliable- all things you want in a Congressperson.  
JB Pritzker - “You come for my people, you come through me”.  No truer words have been spoken.  The Governor has stood up for Illinois residents since day one on the job.  He has brought new jobs; economic growth opportunities and more credit upgrades than any other Governor in the history of the state.  He has been proactive on  reproductive and human rights. My personal favorite thing about the guy is he truly enjoys his job and it shows.



-  Justin - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:49 pm:  US House: I nominate Nikki Budzinski (D) from IL-13. She has an excellent pulse on the district that sprawls from Cahokia to Alton to Springfield to Champaign.
Statewide: I nominate Gov. JB Pritzker (D). He has improved Illinois by leaps and bounds ever since he came into office and dealt with challenges along the way.



-  Shytown - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 5:08 pm:  Member of Congress – Nikki Budzinski all the way. She is a nose to the grindstone, get things done, collaborator who knows how to bring people together. I appreciate her work give a voice to rural America and through the lens of a Democrat (and there are fewer and fewer Dems representing rural spaces today).
Statewide officer – Governor Pritzker for the win. Look at this state today. You can’t even recognize it from nearly six years ago when he was sworn in. The state got its groove back and then some thanks to his leadership - business, economy, human rights, health care. Excited to see what else he and his team have up their sleeves.



-  Joe Bloe - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:11 am:  Statewide: It has to be the Governor.

-  SBA_618 - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 11:26 am:  Best U.S. Representative- Nikki Budzinski because of her constant drive to bring people together and get things done.  When the rubber hits the road, Nikki is likely either behind the wheel or in the car! She has been dedicated to being a hands-on legislator while also establishing herself as a leader within DC.

-  Chicago area advocate - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:13 pm:  Best US Representative: Lauren Underwood. She is active in her community and Washington alike. She connects with and supports constituents across the ideological spectrum, deservedly outperforming other Democrats by significant margins electorally. In Washington, she is focused on major initiatives, including on Black maternal healthcare, and has a proven track record of working across the aisle to pass meaningful legislation, something that will be critical in the coming years. Not only that, but Congresswoman Underwood is a strong supporter of growing our party and engaging the next generation — she uplifts local candidates through her Farm Team PAC, and is even a big part of why I became politically involved. We need more Democrats like Underwood who focus on uplifting others and true public service.
Best Statewide Officer: I have to go with JB Pritzker. He has seamlessly brought progressive leadership to Illinois, explaining policies in a way that is clear, palatable, and persuasive.



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:20 pm:  Chuy. This man is a living legend. Brings home the bacon and his mayor’s love him, even the Republicans. Electorally, one one of the strongest electeds in the country. He outran Harris by 12 pts!



-  Tim - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 1:23 pm:  Statewide, let’s go with Kwame. His leadership has made a tangible impact in protecting Illinois families. Kwame is nationally respected by his peers. Quietly doing the work



-  Pot calling kettle - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 2:39 pm:  I second the Underwood nomination.  For better or worse, Rep. Underwood gained the upper portion of the Illinois Valley during redistricting.  This was to the benefit of that area because her constituent services and personal outreach have been well above recent experience.  She visits the region frequently to highlight her work and solicit input and requests for support.  It is clear that she truly wants to know about the issues facing communities large and small and she and her staff work with whoever comes forward to help them.  She has numerous town halls in every county, recruits local leaders as moderators, answers all questions (and, there have been some out there ones), and then returns during the next recess.  The area has not seen that level of interaction for decades.  On top of that, Underwood provides leadership and support for the Dems - her Farm Team PAC, which supports local candidates is just one example.
For state-wide officer, I nominate the Auditor General Mautino.  Most of what he and his team do is behind the scenes, but it is vital.  Throughout the year, they report on the good, the bad, and the ugly, which allows the agencies, the General Assembly, and the other state-wides to identify and address areas in need of improvement.  Mautino’s depth of understanding about state government allows him to assist anyone who asks “what,” “why,” “which,” and other questions about the various machinations of state government.  Mautino’s demeanor suits the position well.



-  Birds Aren’t Real - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 3:17 pm:  I have to nominate Rep. Lauren Underwood! She’s an effective policymaker and always working to reach her constituents. With the change in DC, she’ll be an EFFECTIVE advocate for Illinois.
For statewide: JB Pritzker for standing up for Illinois and protecting us from attacks we should expect from the federal government.



-  femininomenon - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:33 pm:  Lauren Underwood - She’s approachable, a hard worker and reliable- all things you want in a Congressperson.  
JB Pritzker - “You come for my people, you come through me”.  No truer words have been spoken.  The Governor has stood up for Illinois residents since day one on the job.  He has brought new jobs; economic growth opportunities and more credit upgrades than any other Governor in the history of the state.  He has been proactive on  reproductive and human rights. My personal favorite thing about the guy is he truly enjoys his job and it shows.



-  Justin - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:49 pm:  US House: I nominate Nikki Budzinski (D) from IL-13. She has an excellent pulse on the district that sprawls from Cahokia to Alton to Springfield to Champaign.
Statewide: I nominate Gov. JB Pritzker (D). He has improved Illinois by leaps and bounds ever since he came into office and dealt with challenges along the way.



-  Shytown - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 5:08 pm:  Member of Congress – Nikki Budzinski all the way. She is a nose to the grindstone, get things done, collaborator who knows how to bring people together. I appreciate her work give a voice to rural America and through the lens of a Democrat (and there are fewer and fewer Dems representing rural spaces today).
Statewide officer – Governor Pritzker for the win. Look at this state today. You can’t even recognize it from nearly six years ago when he was sworn in. The state got its groove back and then some thanks to his leadership - business, economy, human rights, health care. Excited to see what else he and his team have up their sleeves.



-  Mike Murphy - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:42 pm:  My top pick for the best U.S. Representative is Nikki Budzinski. Her dedication and ability to collaborate with people from all walks of life are truly refreshing. She’s a hard worker who has built a highly responsive team in both her D.C. and District offices.
Statewide, my choice is the Governor. While I believe there’s still room for improvement, he has done commendable work in attracting businesses to Illinois.

-  47th Ward - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 12:44 pm:  I’ll nominate Mike Bost for best US Representative. He sent Darren Bailey back to Xenia as a private citizen, hopefully for good. He groveled enough to earn the endorsement of the only Republican that matters, and now is poised to serve in the Majority (hopefully not for long). Bost was shooting dogs before Kristi Noem made it fashionable. There really is nothing despicable and cruel that they can’t turn into a political selling point. Who knows? Maybe Bost can be Speaker of the House in 2025? His arrow is pointed up in Congress. 
For best Statewide office holder, I’m going with LG Juliana Stratton, who seems to be everywhere all of the time. At least judging by my FB feed. The Governor has been very supportive of her, including her in things previous LGs could only dream of. Yes, she doesn’t have statutory duties or responsibilities, but she works hard and turning nothing into something on a regular basis.

This was to the benefit of that area because her constituent services and personal outreach have been well above recent experience.  She visits the region frequently to highlight her work and solicit input and requests for support.  It is clear that she truly wants to know about the issues facing communities large and small and she and her staff work with whoever comes forward to help them.  She has numerous town halls in every county, recruits local leaders as moderators, answers all questions (and, there have been some out there ones), and then returns during the next recess.  The area has not seen that level of interaction for decades.  On top of that, Underwood provides leadership and support for the Dems - her Farm Team PAC, which supports local candidates is just one example.
For state-wide officer, I nominate the Auditor General Mautino.  Most of what he and his team do is behind the scenes, but it is vital.  Throughout the year, they report on the good, the bad, and the ugly, which allows the agencies, the General Assembly, and the other state-wides to identify and address areas in need of improvement.  Mautino’s depth of understanding about state government allows him to assist anyone who asks “what,” “why,” “which,” and other questions about the various machinations of state government.  Mautino’s demeanor suits the position well.

-  Birds Aren’t Real - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 3:17 pm:  I have to nominate Rep. Lauren Underwood! She’s an effective policymaker and always working to reach her constituents. With the change in DC, she’ll be an EFFECTIVE advocate for Illinois.
For statewide: JB Pritzker for standing up for Illinois and protecting us from attacks we should expect from the federal government.



-  femininomenon - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:33 pm:  Lauren Underwood - She’s approachable, a hard worker and reliable- all things you want in a Congressperson.  
JB Pritzker - “You come for my people, you come through me”.  No truer words have been spoken.  The Governor has stood up for Illinois residents since day one on the job.  He has brought new jobs; economic growth opportunities and more credit upgrades than any other Governor in the history of the state.  He has been proactive on  reproductive and human rights. My personal favorite thing about the guy is he truly enjoys his job and it shows.



-  Justin - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 4:49 pm:  US House: I nominate Nikki Budzinski (D) from IL-13. She has an excellent pulse on the district that sprawls from Cahokia to Alton to Springfield to Champaign.
Statewide: I nominate Gov. JB Pritzker (D). He has improved Illinois by leaps and bounds ever since he came into office and dealt with challenges along the way.



-  Shytown - Thursday, Dec 19, 24 @ 5:08 pm:  Member of Congress – Nikki Budzinski all the way. She is a nose to the grindstone, get things done, collaborator who knows how to bring people together. I appreciate her work give a voice to rural America and through the lens of a Democrat (and there are fewer and fewer Dems representing rural spaces today).
Statewide officer – Governor Pritzker for the win. Look at this state today. You can’t even recognize it from nearly six years ago when he was sworn in. The state got its groove back and then some thanks to his leadership - business, economy, human rights, health care. Excited to see what else he and his team have up their sleeves.
