The last week of summer is upon us and as we all ready our wardrobes for the cold weather to come, the sneaker industry is back with another week of anticipated drops to keep your rotation ready for action. This time around, Nike, New Balance, adidas, Timberland and Jordan Brand have all assembled notable drops to consider copping. However, before we kick things off with the latest Nike Air Max Sunder release, let’s take a look back at the key headlines from the past seven days.
On the feature front, we connected with sneaker aficionado Bimma Williams to chat about his history in the game, what it’s like to work at various footwear brands and the state of collaborations in an hourlong conversation. We also took time to chat with Odell Beckham Jr. and The Surgeon to discuss the self-described brotherhood that they’ve built via the custom cleats they make together for each NFL game that OBJ plays in.
As for our traditional news, Fat Joe took to Instagram to reveal an Off-White™ x Nike Air Force 1 Low “Arabic” pair while L’Art de L’Automobile clarified that its two-design Nike Air Force 1 Low project is for F&F-only. With Ja Morant’s second signature shoe, the Nike Ja 2, set to release this month, the Swoosh unveiled its complete set of imagery for the debut “Induction” colorway. We also spotted a first look at next year’s “Year of the Mamba” colorway of the Nike Kobe 5 Protro.
Discussions surrounding Jordan Brand saw highs and lows emerge as the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG “Pale Vanilla,” Air Jordan 5 “Black Cat” and more rumored pairs were reportedly cancelled. On the bright side, first looks at “Rare Air” colorways of the Air Jordan 3 and Air Jordan 4 popped up and caught plenty of attention.
Elsewhere in the industry, A$AP Rocky’s partnership with PUMA continues to blossom as the duo unveiled their new Inhale OG collaboration. Meanwhile, we caught a complete visual breakdown of the Doublet x ASICS GEL-KAYANO 20 ahead of its November launch date. Rounding things out, Aimé Leon Dore and New Balance returned with two colorways of the 475.
With all of the past week’s key footwear headlines recapped, let’s go ahead and get started with the ten best sneaker drops of the week to come. Afterwards, be sure to hit up HBX to shop styles that are available to purchase now.

Why You Should Cop: It’s been four years since the Air Jordan 1 High “Mocha” hit the market, offering a combination of white, black and brown across the beloved silhouette. Revisiting the look, Jordan Brand has applied the colorway to its low-top counterpart. White leather kicks things off while black leather covers the overlays, save for the heel, which favors brown. An off-white midsole and black rubber outsole serve as the final touches to this new-yet-familiar look.

Why You Should Cop: We’re about to see LeBron James enter his 22nd year in the NBA and he’s still a force to be reckoned with. Beyond his perennial stardom on the court, his sneaker work with Nike continues to shine bright and is now expanding into the training category with the introduction of the Nike LeBron TR1. The new silhouette sports a lightweight build that lacks a strobel unit, favoring feet being closer to the foam cushioning system. This “Dunk Man” take pairs “Smoke Grey” with “Volt” accents and marks a new chapter for James and the Swoosh.
