Injury updates are available for multiple AEW wrestlers. 
Aussie Open’s Mark Davis has been out of action since suffering a broken wrist at AEW WrestleDream last October. Kyle Fletcher recently told WGN Radio that there is still no timetable for his tag team partner’s return. 
 “I can’t speak exactly on what’s going on right now with him. I think that’s his story to tell, I don’t want to be that person but he’s doing good. He will definitely be back at some stage, we don’t have an exact timeline but yeah, I can’t wait to get back in the ring with him,” Fletcher said. 
The Blade and The Bunny updated fans on their status during a virtual signing with K&S Wrestlefest recently as well. The Blade has been out of action since February with a back injury but says he hopes to return by AEW All In. 
“Just on the injured reserve right now but yes, still with the company,” Blade said. 
Later during the signing, he was asked if he’ll be back in time for AEW All In. 
“I’m hoping so,” Blade responded. “My back’s bad, it’s slowly but surely getting better but I’m hoping to be back in a couple of months.”
Blade also said he’ll be at AEW’s show in his hometown of Buffalo next week. 
In April, Blade wrote on Instagram, “I’m currently off the road nursing a lower back injury. 2 bulging discs, L2 L3 and L4 L5. Plus two ruptured discs, L3 L4 and L5 S1. I’d like to thank @aew and @tonyrkhan for giving me this time off to heal.”
The Bunny hasn’t wrestled since September. She was removed from the AEW roster page in November and says she’s currently taking a hiatus from wrestling.
“I’m figure skating right now and I’m loving it. I’m acting and I’m taking a little hiatus from breaking my body weekly,” Bunny said. “19 years, I think I deserve a little break. Never say never but as of right now, I’m really enjoying my figure skating and acting. It’s very fun.”
“I have a project coming up but I can’t talk about it yet but I do have a project coming up that’s very exciting. It’s horror-related,” she added.
