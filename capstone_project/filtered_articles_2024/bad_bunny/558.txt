Bad Bunny is suing a fan named Eric Guillermo Madronal Garrone for posting unauthorized concert footage on YouTube. The lawsuit alleges that Garrone uploaded full song performances from Bad Bunny’s Most Wanted Tour without consent, using the artist’s name and music for ad revenue. Bad Bunny seeks an injunction to prevent further uploads and requests $150,000 per video or compensation for damages.
This case is reminiscent of an incident involving Frank Ocean and Coachella, where unauthorized footage was shared online. The legal action highlights the importance of respecting artists’ rights to their live performances and the consequences of unauthorized sharing of concert footage.
