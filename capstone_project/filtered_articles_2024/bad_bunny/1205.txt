Hello everyone, and welcome to the week! It’s time once again for our look back at the noteworthy updates of the last seven days. I had the idle thought of just filling today’s list with fake updates, in spirit of today’s calendar event. But I don’t like that event very much, so we’re just going to do a normal edition today. It’s a pretty normal crew today, with fewer Easter-themed updates than I personally expected. Of course, you can keep an eye out for updates yourself by participating in the TouchArcade forums. This weekly summary is just here to fill you in on the things you might have missed. Let’s go for it!










Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Free
	
	It’s been a long while since we had Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp in this feature, so let’s pop in and give it its due. The latest update is of course Easter-themed, or at least as Easter-themed as Animal Crossing is willing to get. Bunny Day, in other words. Yes, that creepy creature is back. Unzip the zipper, dethrone the false god. Aside from that, there are some new gifts, new normal classes in Happy Homeroom, and some UI improvements. Probably some bug fixes too, but they don’t say anything about that in the notes so we can’t be certain.

Jetpack Joyride, Free
	
	Phew, that was close. Jetpack Joyride almost missed a major holiday! That wouldn’t have been good. Anyway, Easter Eggstravaganza. You know, it’s the usual Jetpack Joyride event. The game’s strength and weakness. Collect the themed tokens, exchange for themed prizes. These ones are eggs, bunnies, and so on. Next time will probably be Abraham Lincolns or something. It’s Jetpack Joyride.

stitch., 
	
	It’s the usual sort of update for stitch, and by that I mean there are some new Hoops for us to enjoy. There’s no real theme to them this time, as they are scattered across various categories and come in different sizes. The update notes promise us such treats as Panda the Doctor and Doggy the Detective, which seem like perfectly enjoyable things to be stitching. Also in this update: bug fixes. CONFIRMED.

Mortal Kombat, Free
	
	Wow, this app is celebrating its ninth anniversary. That’s a pretty good chunk of time. I spent most of it laying around thinking about cows. Anyway, this update. Some new fighters including MK1 Shang Tsung and Onslaught Fujin, both of whom seem very cool. Some updated Tower Events to play, with one offering a chance to win that aforementioned MK1 Shang Tsung. A couple of new Friendships, allowing Jade and Sub-Zero to show their kindness. There are also some new Kombat Passes, a store overhaul, and a bunch of bug fixes and other little improvements. I think I’ll give this the coveted UMMSotW award, as an anniversary present.

DC Heroes & Villains: Match 3, Free
	
	Here’s our obligatory free-to-play matching puzzle game update for the week, offering up DC Heroes & Villains for the first time in this feature. Fans of the Green Lantern Cops will be happy to hear that they have made their way into the game, along with a new group bonus feature to beef up your squad. Maybe one group might be Green Lanterns? There’s also an Easter Egg Hunt event if you are like me and find the idea of Batman hunting small chocolate eggs hilarious. Finally, bug fixes and improvements. You know they’re here, they know they’re here, and they are indeed here.

The King of Fighters ALLSTAR, Free
	
	Been a hot minute since I looked in on this one, so let’s do that little thing. There’s a new UE fighter here, XV’s Isla. Adults beware! Some balance improvements have arrived for 2003 Maki Kagura, XIII Ash Crimson, XV Iori Yagami, and XV Omega Rugal. The Tower of Illusion has been expanded, and Plug-In Plant Tier 7 has been unlocked, so get at those when you have a chance. No Easter event here, but there is a Cherry Blossom Viewing Gift event, which… yes, I suppose it is just about that time. You can also enjoy some Relay Bingo with Isla if that’s your preference. Not a bad update, all told.

Diablo Immortal, Free
	
	The Precipice of Horror! Not quite horror! But very very near it! One more step and boom, you’re in horror! This is a big update with a lot of new stuff to do and events to join in on. There’s also some new Eternal Equipment, and that’s a guarantee you don’t see often these days. Some returning events help pad things out a bit, a new limited event called Hellrise is live as you read this, and some new gems and bundles are available for the people chucking actual human money at this game.

Honkai: Star Rail, Free
	
	Version two-point-one! It’s like two-point-oh but less exciting somehow. Just a single tenth of a point, but here we are. The update is called Into the Yawning Chasm, which nicely describes me at meal time. Some new characters, three in total. Returning characters, Luocha and Jingliu. A few new Light Cones, a new story in the form of a Trailblaze Mission called Penacony – The Devil in Velvet (!), an assortment of other events, and a couple of new maps. Top it off with some new enemies to fight, new Planar Ornaments, and a bunch of other goodies and you’ve got a point-one update that feels like a point-five at least.

Star Traders: Frontiers, $6.99
	
	Sure, let’s pop in on our old friends, the Trese Brothers. What have they been up to this week, the little rascals? A new ship component, the Esteemed Guest Cabins. A few new ship weapons, too: the Chimera Missile Battery, the Daystar Railgun (Size Small), and the Seraphim Railgun Array (Size Medium). I love those names. I bet coming up with the names of things is at least half the fun of game development. The last piece of this new version adds some new components to the enemy ship builder. Considering the near-weekly rate of updates to this game, I think this one is fairly substantial.

Hungry Shark World, Free
	
	Okay, I think I need to sit down the Hungry Shark World developers for a little talk. There seems to be a serious misunderstanding happening here, and I’m surprised no one has said anything until now. People. People. Dragons are not sharks. I don’t know why baby dragons are arriving via portals from a place called Dragonheim, but they should probably just head home. This is Hungry SHARK World, not Hungry Dragon World. Sorry, but someone had to say it. Carry on with your day. Your shark-filled, dragon-less day.

That about wraps it up for last week’s significant updates. I’m sure I’ve missed some, though, so please feel free to comment below and let everyone know if you think something should be mentioned. As usual, major updates will likely get their own news stories throughout this week, and I’ll be back next Monday to summarize and fill in the blanks. Have a great week!
