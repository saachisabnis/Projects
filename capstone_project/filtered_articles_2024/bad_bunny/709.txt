Kendall Jenner rekindled romance rumors with her ex Bad Bunny at a 2024 Met Gala afterparty on Monday, May 6.
Jenner, 28, and Bad Bunny, 30, were spotted laughing and drinking cocktails at the Après in New York City following the ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The afterparty was hosted by Emily Ratajkowski, Paloma Elsesser, Renell Medra, Carlos Nazario, Francesco Risso and Raúl Lopez.
“They looked like they were back together,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly about how the couple were “hanging out and talking very close.”
The reunion didn’t appear to be a “chance meeting,” with the insider adding, “Bad Bunny arrived first and went to a VIP table by the DJ booth. Kendall showed up about 15 minutes later. It definitely seemed like she was meeting him there.”
Jenner and Bad Bunny acted “very cutesy” throughout the night. “They seemed like they were the only two in the room. They weren’t engaging with other people for a while,” the insider continued. “They were sitting side by side and they had permanent smiles on their faces the whole time. It was cute.”
According to the source, the pair didn’t mind being noticed. “They were touching and sitting close,” the insider concluded. “They didn’t seem to care who saw. The whole party was raising eyebrows and trying to see what they were up to. It was very open.”
For the after hours bash, the reality TV star wore a custom white corset and lace-adorned mini dress by Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood and was spotted in a second look, an archival white leather corset by Givenchy with a silk skirt. The rapper wore a black leather jacket with a white undershirt and brown slacks at the Clase Azul sponsored party.
Their night out comes less than six months after the former couple split in December 2023. An insider exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that “friends aren’t surprised” by the separation, adding, “They never really saw their relationship going the distance anyway.”
According to the source, Jenner’s friends doubted the depth of their relationship to begin with. “Of course, they want the best for their friend, but they really didn’t feel like Kendall was as compatible with Bad Bunny as she was in past relationships with other people,” the insider added. “At the same time, Kendall has had a few on-off relationships in the past, so they wouldn’t be totally surprised if she got back together with him at some point.”
The Grammy winner and Jenner were initially linked in February 2023 when they were seen on a date in Beverly Hills. They attended the 2023 Met Gala separately that spring before being spotted together at an afterparty.
Bad Bunny addressed speculation about the duo’s romance during a June 2023 interview with Rolling Stone. “I know something is going to come out,” he said at the time. “I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what’s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.”
When asked specifically about Jenner, he replied, “That’s the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.”
In her own interview with WSJ. Magazine, Jenner said, “I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. Does that make sense?”

She added: “I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.”
Serving as a co-chair alongside Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez on Monday, Bad Bunny arrived in a custom navy blue suit from Maison Margiela to mark the debut of the Met Costume Institute’s “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibit. He accessorized with an oversized beret, quirky sunglasses, leather gloves and a bouquet of flowers. Jenner, for her part, made her entrance in a shimmering floor-length Givenchy gown.
