MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Today, the Supreme Court gets into vaping. Vaping, for the uninitiated, is like smoking. You use a device to inhale. It helps some smokers kick tobacco, but it's also become popular with kids as young as middle school-aged. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has this report.NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Bill Schultz, the FDA's deputy commissioner for policy in the 1990s, summarizes the smoking landscape this way.BILL SCHULTZ: When FDA started regulating cigarettes in the 1990s, a third of kids smoked cigarettes. It's now 2%.TOTENBERG: That's the good news, he says. The bad news is...SCHULTZ: In the meantime, e-cigarettes have filled the vacuum to some extent.TOTENBERG: Indeed, according to national surveys conducted by the FDA and the CDC, the percentage of high school kids who reported daily vaping of e cigarettes jumped from 9.7% in 2014 to 30% in 2023. That jump's important because under a federal law enacted by Congress in 2009, the FDA is charged with curbing the use of tobacco products from minors in order to prevent them from becoming addicted to nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, which entered the U.S. market in 2006. Today's case is about how the FDA went about doing that. Jonathan Adler is a professor at Case Western Reserve Law School and has written extensively about this subject.JONATHAN ADLER: There's a concern that the FDA has kind of been operating in an ad hoc unfair manner in the way it's been evaluating all of these applications for what are literally millions of vaping products.TOTENBERG: Basically, the FDA has made it all but impossible for vaping companies to sell their products using flavors that appeal to kids, flavors like pink lemonade, rainbow road, jimmy the juice-man, peachy strawberry, and suicide bunny mother's milk and cookies. To date, only 27 companies, most of them small, have been approved to sell their vaping products, and the vaping industry has gone to court to challenge the FDA veto of millions of products the agency deems to be aimed at minors.Seven appeals courts have, for the most part, approved the FDA's decisions. Two at least partially rejected those decisions. But one Federal Court, the ultraconservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected the FDA's decision-making, eviscerating the agency's conduct as a switcheroo in which the companies were told that the agency was looking at marketing studies but then changed its mind. Professor Adler says the Fifth Circuit decision was far broader than any other appellate ruling.ADLER: This was the case that threatened to allow all vaping product manufacturers to put their products on the market and keep their products on the market.TOTENBERG: What's more, he says, there was an additional feature.ADLER: The Fifth Circuit's aggressive approach to allowing folks to sue within that circuit threatened to make this decision the de facto rule for the country as a whole and one that would require the FDA to completely remake its regulatory regime.TOTENBERG: So while the Biden administration had not appealed other adverse lower court rulings, it challenged this one full bore. Still, as Adler observes, the FDA has not been clear about what the vaping companies must show to get the go-ahead for flavored e-cigarettes.ADLER: The FDA wanted to know what the companies would do to prevent the marketing of their products to children. The FDA then decided that it didn't think any restrictions on marketing would do enough, and so it stopped looking at that part of the application.TOTENBERG: Basically, the companies claim that because the specific demands of the agency have been a moving target, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law. Former FDA Deputy Commissioner Schultz has a different take. He notes that just as the agency had to gain experience with earlier products and devices it was charged with regulating since 2009, it has had to gain experience with these in order to provide regulatory guidance with vaping products.Indeed, the agency stopped looking at the marketing of vaping products to children because it concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes without harming large numbers of kids. To date, the only flavored cigarettes the agency has approved for sale are those that are tobacco- or menthol-flavored. The FDA concluded that those flavors are more likely to get adults off regular and far more dangerous cigarettes and less likely to attract underage users.Keep in mind, though, that the conservative Supreme Court supermajority has not hesitated to redraw the regulatory map. And if it does so in this case, it could well open the floodgates to flavored e-cigarettes that greatly increase the number of kids vaping their way through middle and high school.

Jonathan Adler is a professor at Case Western Reserve Law School and has written extensively about this subject.JONATHAN ADLER: There's a concern that the FDA has kind of been operating in an ad hoc unfair manner in the way it's been evaluating all of these applications for what are literally millions of vaping products.TOTENBERG: Basically, the FDA has made it all but impossible for vaping companies to sell their products using flavors that appeal to kids, flavors like pink lemonade, rainbow road, jimmy the juice-man, peachy strawberry, and suicide bunny mother's milk and cookies. To date, only 27 companies, most of them small, have been approved to sell their vaping products, and the vaping industry has gone to court to challenge the FDA veto of millions of products the agency deems to be aimed at minors.Seven appeals courts have, for the most part, approved the FDA's decisions. Two at least partially rejected those decisions. But one Federal Court, the ultraconservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected the FDA's decision-making, eviscerating the agency's conduct as a switcheroo in which the companies were told that the agency was looking at marketing studies but then changed its mind. Professor Adler says the Fifth Circuit decision was far broader than any other appellate ruling.ADLER: This was the case that threatened to allow all vaping product manufacturers to put their products on the market and keep their products on the market.TOTENBERG: What's more, he says, there was an additional feature.ADLER: The Fifth Circuit's aggressive approach to allowing folks to sue within that circuit threatened to make this decision the de facto rule for the country as a whole and one that would require the FDA to completely remake its regulatory regime.TOTENBERG: So while the Biden administration had not appealed other adverse lower court rulings, it challenged this one full bore. Still, as Adler observes, the FDA has not been clear about what the vaping companies must show to get the go-ahead for flavored e-cigarettes.ADLER: The FDA wanted to know what the companies would do to prevent the marketing of their products to children. The FDA then decided that it didn't think any restrictions on marketing would do enough, and so it stopped looking at that part of the application.TOTENBERG: Basically, the companies claim that because the specific demands of the agency have been a moving target, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law. Former FDA Deputy Commissioner Schultz has a different take. He notes that just as the agency had to gain experience with earlier products and devices it was charged with regulating since 2009, it has had to gain experience with these in order to provide regulatory guidance with vaping products.Indeed, the agency stopped looking at the marketing of vaping products to children because it concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes without harming large numbers of kids. To date, the only flavored cigarettes the agency has approved for sale are those that are tobacco- or menthol-flavored. The FDA concluded that those flavors are more likely to get adults off regular and far more dangerous cigarettes and less likely to attract underage users.Keep in mind, though, that the conservative Supreme Court supermajority has not hesitated to redraw the regulatory map. And if it does so in this case, it could well open the floodgates to flavored e-cigarettes that greatly increase the number of kids vaping their way through middle and high school.

Still, as Adler observes, the FDA has not been clear about what the vaping companies must show to get the go-ahead for flavored e-cigarettes.ADLER: The FDA wanted to know what the companies would do to prevent the marketing of their products to children. The FDA then decided that it didn't think any restrictions on marketing would do enough, and so it stopped looking at that part of the application.TOTENBERG: Basically, the companies claim that because the specific demands of the agency have been a moving target, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law. Former FDA Deputy Commissioner Schultz has a different take. He notes that just as the agency had to gain experience with earlier products and devices it was charged with regulating since 2009, it has had to gain experience with these in order to provide regulatory guidance with vaping products.Indeed, the agency stopped looking at the marketing of vaping products to children because it concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes without harming large numbers of kids. To date, the only flavored cigarettes the agency has approved for sale are those that are tobacco- or menthol-flavored. The FDA concluded that those flavors are more likely to get adults off regular and far more dangerous cigarettes and less likely to attract underage users.Keep in mind, though, that the conservative Supreme Court supermajority has not hesitated to redraw the regulatory map. And if it does so in this case, it could well open the floodgates to flavored e-cigarettes that greatly increase the number of kids vaping their way through middle and high school.

TOTENBERG: Basically, the FDA has made it all but impossible for vaping companies to sell their products using flavors that appeal to kids, flavors like pink lemonade, rainbow road, jimmy the juice-man, peachy strawberry, and suicide bunny mother's milk and cookies. To date, only 27 companies, most of them small, have been approved to sell their vaping products, and the vaping industry has gone to court to challenge the FDA veto of millions of products the agency deems to be aimed at minors.Seven appeals courts have, for the most part, approved the FDA's decisions. Two at least partially rejected those decisions. But one Federal Court, the ultraconservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected the FDA's decision-making, eviscerating the agency's conduct as a switcheroo in which the companies were told that the agency was looking at marketing studies but then changed its mind.

ADLER: The FDA wanted to know what the companies would do to prevent the marketing of their products to children. The FDA then decided that it didn't think any restrictions on marketing would do enough, and so it stopped looking at that part of the application.TOTENBERG: Basically, the companies claim that because the specific demands of the agency have been a moving target, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law. Former FDA Deputy Commissioner Schultz has a different take. He notes that just as the agency had to gain experience with earlier products and devices it was charged with regulating since 2009, it has had to gain experience with these in order to provide regulatory guidance with vaping products.Indeed, the agency stopped looking at the marketing of vaping products to children because it concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes without harming large numbers of kids. To date, the only flavored cigarettes the agency has approved for sale are those that are tobacco- or menthol-flavored. The FDA concluded that those flavors are more likely to get adults off regular and far more dangerous cigarettes and less likely to attract underage users.Keep in mind, though, that the conservative Supreme Court supermajority has not hesitated to redraw the regulatory map. And if it does so in this case, it could well open the floodgates to flavored e-cigarettes that greatly increase the number of kids vaping their way through middle and high school.
