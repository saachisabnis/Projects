Bad Bunny is a bonafide hitmaker who has the numbers to prove it. 

	The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio turns 30 years old tomorrow (March 10) and in celebration, Billboard has compiled all of his 14 songs to have topped the Hot Latin Songs chart. The chart ranks the most popular Latin songs of the week, blending airplay, streaming and digital sales data.

	Since his breakthrough year in 2016, the Puerto Rican superstar has only doubled down on his global domination. Bad Bunny scored his first leader on the tally in May 2018 thanks to the star-studded “Te Boté” featuring Casper Mágico, Nio García, Darell, Nicky Jam and Ozuna. Subsequently, his Drake-assisted “Mía,” from his debut album X100PRE, also topped the chart for 16 weeks that same year. 

	Bad Bunny, who’s currently on his Most Wanted Tour, has since landed at No. 1 on 12 more occasions, including six solo hits. His longest-running title is the edgy reggaetón jam “Dákiti” with Jhay Cortez, which debuted and peaked at No. 1 in November 2020, and ruled for 27 weeks.

	Meanwhile, Un Verano Sin Ti — which became Bunny’s second No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 and stayed atop the tally for 13 weeks — is the set that has produced more No. 1 hits for the singer, including “Moscow Mule,” “Titi Me Preguntó” and the Chencho Corleone-assisted banger “Me Porto Bonito.” 

	In honor of Bad Bunny’s 30th birthday on March 10, check out all of his No. 1 hits (ranked chronologically by peak date).
