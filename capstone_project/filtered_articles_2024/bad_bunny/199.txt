Want to spend your Friday night with Bad Bunny? In Miami, anything is possible, kind of.
The reggaetonero is the star of the Frost Planetarium’s new laser shows at the Phillip & Patricia Frost Museum of Science downtown.
OK, so Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, won’t actually be there.
The King of Latin Trap, who recently split with Kendall Jenner, is busy promoting a risque new video for his song “No Me Quiero Casar” (I Don’t Want to Get Married).
Back to the show, which starts at 11 p.m.: Expect a bunch of Bad Bunny’s greatest hits such as “Tití Me Preguntó,” “Ojitos Lindos” and “Callaíta” paired with psychedelic visuals that you watch with special glasses under the planetarium’s 67-foot-high dome.
Book early, like right after you’ve read this. We are told the event is a popular one, and that the 9 p.m. show already sold out.
After all the holiday action, does 11 p.m. seem late? To pass the time before your visit, you may want to pop by Gekko, the Brickell hotspot the Puerto Rican rapper co-owns, for a drink.
As for when fans can really watch Bad Bunny in action? The 29-year-old King of Latin Trap’s Most Wanted Tour kicks off on Feb. 21 in Salt Lake City, wrapping at the Kaseya Center with three shows May 24-26.
Info: 11 p.m. Friday. Phillip & Patricia Frost Museum of Science, 1101 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; 305-434-9600; frostscience.org.
Tickets: $10, include glasses. Onsite parking is available in the museum garage for an $8 flat rate.
