Harry Styles capped the 65th annual Grammy Awards with a somewhat surprising Album of the Year win for Harry House, wrapping a night that was most memorable for seeing a cherished record fall.

	Beyoncé came into the Trevor Noah-hosted ceremony in Los Angeles with a leading nine nominations, tying her spouse Jay-Z as the most-nominated act of all time with 88 — and tonight she set the big record. The Queen of Pop became the all-time leader in career Grammys, winning won twice tonight and twice during the preshow. After breaking her tie with Quincy Jones for second place at 28, she got a 32nd career Grammy, topping the conductor Georg Solti, who scored his 31st statuette posthumously in 1999.

	










	Beyoncé had followed with her two preshow wins with primetime nods for Best R&B Song (“Cuff It”) and Best Dance/Electronic Music Album (Renaissance). She was, however, shut out in the three marquee categories despite being nominated for each.

	Lizzo’s “About Damn Time” took Record of the Year, which goes to the artist and producer. First Lady Jill Biden presented Song of the Year to Bonnie Raitt for “Just Like That,” a surprising win for her fourth Grammy on the day. Sarama Joy won Best New Artist.
