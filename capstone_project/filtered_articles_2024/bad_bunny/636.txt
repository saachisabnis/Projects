Bad Bunny‘s Most Wanted Tour concluded in the U.S. in spectacular fashion, shattering multiple records and bringing his latest album, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana, to life in dozens of cities. Throughout the journey, the artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio delighted fans by introducing numerous surprise guests along the way.

	The Puerto Rican superstar kicked off the Live Nation-promoted tour in Salt Lake City, Utah on February 21, and concluded the U.S. leg at Miami’s Kaseya Center (where he played three consecutive dates) on May 26. According to Billboard Boxscore, the tour grossed $207.8 million and sold 703,000 tickets in 30 concerts, selling out all the venues it played. He still has three shows left at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico, in San Juan, from June 7 to 9.

	A statement from Acoustyle Communication indicates that Bad Bunny is now the”highest-grossing artist in the history of Barclays Center, surpassing even the 12-show record held by Jay Z.” (To read a recap of Bad Bunny in New York, click here.) 

	With a 37-song setlist, The Most Wanted Tour spanned Bunny’s diverse discography, with a special focus on Nadie Sabe, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Top Latin Albums and Latin Rhythm Albums charts when it was released in October 2023. In addition, the week of release 24 Benito songs — including all 22 on the set — entered the Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. tally.

	The Most Wanted Tour followed the World’s Hottest Tour stadium tour and before that El Último Tour del Mundo, which together closed in 2022 with a staggering $435 million. 

	In some cities, Bad Bunny surprised his fans with guest artists that also included Grupo Frontera, Eladio Carrión, Young Miko, Feid, Yovngchimi and more. 

	Here are all of Bad Bunny’s surprise guests in the U.S. during his Most Wanted Tour, in alphabetical order:

	On March 13, during the first of his three shows at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, Bad Bunny was joined by Bryant Myers, a frequent collaborator. Together, they performed “Seda,” a track from Bunny’s latest album. Myers also accompanied Bunny on the first night (April 11) of three in New York at the Barclays Center. 

	The longtime Puerto Rican friends have previously joined forces on early Bunny hits such as 2017 singles “Pa Ti” and “Un Ratito Más,” as well as “Triste” from Myers’ 2018 debut album La Oscuridad. Check them out shouting out Puerto Rico on their latest trap effort “Seda.”

	Amidst the electric atmosphere at Barclays Center, the last of Bad Bunny’s three performances in New York City on Saturday (April 13) left the audience on the edge of their seats. Carrión emerged from the opposite side of the stage from Bunny, on a structure that resembled a bridge. He rocked a flowy trenchcoat and baggy pants, and Bunny, with his trademark cowboy attire, performed the menacing drill number “Thunder y Lightning” off of Nadie Sabe. 

	Their collaboration was no mere coincidence; these Puerto Rican friends have a history of hits together. From Carrion’s previous anthems “Coco Chanel” off of 3MEN2 KBRN  to the pair’s trap single “Kemba Walker” (2019), their union always promises to be unforgettable.

	On March 5 in Sacramento, Bad Bunny surprised fans by welcoming Colombian sensation Feid to the stage. Under the glow of green lighting — a nod to El Ferxxo’s signature aesthetic — the duo delivered a powerful rendition of the reggaeton hit “Perro Negro” off Bunny’s latest album. The audience was ecstatic over Feid’s unexpected appearance, as can be seen in the performance video below:

	On April 30, Texas superstars Grupo Frontera teamed up with El Conejo Malo at Houston’s Toyota Center to perform their groundbreaking collaboration, “un X100to.” Donning their signature cowboy hats and exuding Tex-Mex charm, the six-member ensemble did not miss a note. Meanwhile, Bad Bunny captivated the audience, delivering his verses while perched atop a grand piano.

	As Bad Bunny served himself a glass of licor while wearing a black head scarf with studs, he also prepared the crowd to the next moment — Mora’s unexpected arrival. 

	The star from Bayamón, Puerto Rico, emerged from behind Bunny, adding more energy to the captivated crowd at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on the third night, March 15. Together, they delivered a lively performance of “Hibiki,” a fast-paced, house-infused trap song and the fourth track from Bunny’s latest album. You can view their dynamic performance in the video below:

	On March 30, Bad Bunny surprised audiences with a special appearance by Young Miko for the closing night of his Chicago dates. Benito welcomed her with a gigantic hug, and together, they performed “Fina,” off of Nadie Sabe, live for the first time. Bunny had previously showed his support for the emerging star in July of 2022 when she made a surprise appearance on his Coliseo de Puerto Rico show, before kicking off World’s Hottest Tour that year. 

	Amid a sample of Tego Calderón’s “Pa’ Que Retozen,” “Fina” sees the artists shining with lyrical brilliance. Check out their live showcase below:

	“I was screaming!” commented a concert-goer on Yovngchimi’s TikTok post, reacting to the moment when the rising Puerto Rican rapper took the stage alongside the superstar to perform the trap hit “Mercedes Carota” from Bunny’s latest album. Yovngchimi made a striking entrance in a grey jumpsuit and bleached cornrows, while Bunny electrified the audience at Orlando’s Kia Center on May 18, rallying them with a shout of “¡Que se sienta la energía!“
