Bad Bunny has shared his second single of the year, El Clúb. 
The clubby track fuses house beats with synths and traditional guitars, though maintains the Puerto Rican artist's reggaeton roots. Head below to view the accompanying head-spinning, kaleidoscopic video, directed by Stillz.
It follows Bad Bunny's recent Latin Grammy Award win for Best Reggaeton Performance with Perro Negro featuring Feid. The track features on Bad Bunny's 2023 album, 'Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana', which is also nominated for a Grammy in the Best Música Urbana Album category.
In September, Bad Bunny dropped Una Velita, a song that addresses the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria on his native Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean.
