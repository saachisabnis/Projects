Vogue World 2024 is about the century-spanning fashion, obviously. But can you blame us for appreciating some of the handsome gentlemen who graced the Place Vendôme with their presence—both on and off the runway?
Given that Vogue World 2024 honors the history of fashion and sport, it’s no surprise that plenty of these attendees represented both disciplines. A host of athletes took to the runway in a mix of the last century’s finest fashions and in various uniforms. American football star Joe Burrow was a highlight during the equestrian section, while Victor Wembanyama represented France in the star-studded finale. But the runway was packed with plenty of professional models, too, like Alton Mason.
It wasn't just the rich Venn diagram of athletics and fashion; plenty of easy-on-the-eyes artists were part of the proceedings too. Colman Domingo strutted his stuff during the 1980s martial arts chapter, while John Mulaney and Evan Mock watched from the audience. Meanwhile, musicians Maluma and Bad Bunny had us struggling to keep our eyes glued to the runway.
Enjoy below, as we appreciate all of our Internet Boyfriends who turned out for Vogue World 2024.
