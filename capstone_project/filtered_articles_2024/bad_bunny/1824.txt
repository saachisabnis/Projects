Throughout 2024, Jenner was seen spending time with both men, leading to ongoing speculation about her love life.
Jenner and Booker were also spotted separately at the Paris Olympics, both wearing Team USA gear. This came after rumors of tension between Booker and Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart√≠nez Ocasio, sparked by a line in the rapper's song "Coco Chanel," where he seemed to take a jab at Booker.
The Puerto Rican rapper referenced Jenner's zodiac sign, Scorpio, and described the pair as dangerous in the 2023 released track.
Booker seemingly hinted at his frustration with Bunny's song, writing in an Instagram comment section, "He worried about another MAN again," according to 'The Blast.'
Bad Bunny and Jenner dated for nearly a year until December 2023 when their romance started to "fizzle out," according to 'Entertainment Tonight' sources.
The 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' alumna posted a reflective quote about peace and self-love on Instagram, suggesting she has chosen to prioritize her own well-being amid any drama.
