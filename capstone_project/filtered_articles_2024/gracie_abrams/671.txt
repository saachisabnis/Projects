	Yes, it’s so true that Gracie Abrams has an alternate version of her recent single, “That’s So True,” in her files… but you’ll never hear it.

	During a wide-ranging conversation with her co-writer and friend Audrey Hobert for Spotify’s “You’re Invited, I’m Sorry: An Evening with Gracie Abrams” on Tuesday night (Nov. 12), the duo opened up about writing the song after getting a little tipsy at New York City’s Electric Lady Studios, as seen in videos circulating social media from the event.

	“We were drunk when we wrote the lyrics,” Hobert noted, before Abrams added, “Yeah, there’s a very vulgar version of ‘That’s So True’ that will never see the light of day.”

	Abrams then recalled a hilariously awkward moment when they were writing said “vulgar” version of the track on the rooftop at the NYC studio. “We didn’t know that there was a roof above the roof until I got a text from Lee [Foster], who runs the studio, at one point,” she explained. “We were a little drunk — in a great way, like, a light, fresh way — we actually doubled over in tears laughing so hard saying the most horrific s— to song. Then, I get a text and he’s like, ‘Mumford and Sons are doing an interview right above you.’ It was bad! I was like, ‘Oh God!'”

	Since its release in October, “That’s So True” has gained serious momentum, thanks in part to a boost from TikTok virality. The track currently sits at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	Elsewhere in the interview, Abrams discussed her first-ever Grammy nominations for best new artist and best pop/duo group performance for her Taylor Swift collaboration, “Us,” saying she spoke with the superstar on the phone after the news. “We were like, ‘That’s just silly full circle,'” she shared, adding that she did not expect the nomination but she’s “very grateful.”
