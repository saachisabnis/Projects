The folk-pop star will be joined by Gracie Abrams on July 4 next year
Headliners for next yearâ€™s British Summer Time at Hyde Park have been coming in thick and fast in recent weeks. Kicking things off was Jeff Lynneâ€™s Electric Light OrchestraÂ (whose headline show will be their very last), BST followed-upÂ withÂ country music star Zach Bryan, who announced a second headline day after his first swiftly sold out. Hugh Jackman was the third to be revealed last week.Â 
Now, itâ€™s been revealed that folk-popÂ sensationÂ Noah Kahan is joining them! Noah has soared to stardom over the last couple of years and on his previous trips toÂ London has playedÂ four sold out shows at Wembley Arena and the O2. 
If you missed your chance on those occasions, hereâ€™s how to get you hands on tickets to Noahâ€™s headline BST performance.Â
