If you need a reason to write daily, take it from Taylor Swift, do it. Gracie Abrams recently was doing an interview and praised Taylor as an artist, friend and mentor. Gracie credits Taylor with inspiring her to write daily, which has become a crucial part of her routine. Gracie has this to say:

Now I start to feel like sh*t when I don’t do it. It’s like eating well, getting enough sleep, and drinking enough

Gracie is set to release her second album, The Secret of Us, on the 21st. It has a duet with Taylor.
