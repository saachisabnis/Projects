Her sophomore album includes a collaboration with Taylor Swift, and Abrams will join the 34-year-old pop icon for the final portion of her Eras tour, which kicks off Friday evening.

"She's as extraordinary a friend and mentor as she is an artist and a writer. She's really just the best," Abrams said of Swift in June.
She continues her The Secret of Us Tour Feb. 8 in Madrid, Spain.
In "Packing it Up," she sings, "I swear that I wasn't looking for much but that's just when you happened. That's right when you happened."
