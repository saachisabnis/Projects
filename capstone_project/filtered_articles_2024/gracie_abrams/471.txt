New England singer-songwriter Noah Kahan promised some special guests for his two sold-out Fenway Park shows in Boston. On the first night, he delivered.
Gracie Abrams — a rising pop singer-songwriter who was among Kahan’s fellow Grammy nominees for Best New Artist this year — joined the Vermont native on stage for their collaboration of “Everywhere, Everything.”
“Give it up for Gracie Abrams,” Kahan said, as fans screamed in delight. After all, many fans had speculated on social media recently that Abrams might make an appearance at Fenway.
Abrams, who recently released her latest album “The Secret of Us” featuring a song with Taylor Swift, will bring her own tour to MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston on Oct. 9.
