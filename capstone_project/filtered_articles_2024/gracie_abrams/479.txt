During every ‚ÄúEras Tour‚Äù concert, there comes a time that audiences are always waiting for: surprise-song o‚Äôclock.
This is when Taylor Swift sits down with just a guitar and a piano to play acoustic versions of two songs ‚Äî sometimes mashups, sometimes not ‚Äî that change between each show. And fans don‚Äôt know what songs she‚Äôs chosen that night until the surprise-song set starts.
Swift kicked off the European leg of her ‚ÄúEras Tour‚Äù May 9 in Paris, fresh on the heels of releasing her 11th album, ‚ÄúThe Tortured Poets Department,‚Äù on April 29. While the setlist saw some significant changes ‚Äî including the addition of a new era ‚Äî Swift upheld her tradition of performing surprise songs.
After returning to the U.S. Oct. 18 for a run of shows in three more cities, Swift closed out the "Eras Tour" in Canada on Dec. 8.
Intrepid Swifties keeping record of all the songs Swift has performed noted that, while there are several songs that were played multiple times, there are some tracks from across her 11 albums that the singer did not sing at all during the "Eras Tour." Those include:
"That's When"
"Bye Bye Baby"
"Girl At Home"
"Ronan"
"Forever Winter"
"Soon You'll Get Better"
