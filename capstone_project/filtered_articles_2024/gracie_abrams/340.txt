Here's when and how to get presale tickets to Gracie Abrams' The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour dates.
Gracie Abrams fans assemble! She's just announced The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour dates, so how do you get tickets?
Yesterday (9 Dec), Gracie Abrams surprised fans by announcing a brand new "Deluxe" leg of The Secret of Us Tour. Taking to Instagram, she said: "!!!!!!!!!!!! Iâ€™m so excited to announce that weâ€™re coming back to North America next summer with our dear friend @rolemodelðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™!!!!!!!!" Not only that but Gracie is performing at arenas.
Following the huge success of her songs 'I Love You, I'm Sorry' and 'That's So True', it comes as no shock that the demand to see Gracie is higher than ever. So to help you get your hands on tickets, here's all the information you need to know including presale codes, ticket prices, dates, cities, setlist and support acts.

Alongside her Deluxe Tour announcement, Gracie confirmed that fans can signup for presale codes via her website. She wrote: "Sign up for presale access now on gracieabrams.com/tour for your city." Her site reads: "Sign up for presale access in your city's listing below. Presale sign-up closes on Tuesday, December 10 at 10 PM PT."
You can then click sign up next to the date you wish to attend or visit this link directly. All you need to do then is to login to your Ticketmaster account and there you can choose two dates to sign up to get presale access for. 
Tickets to Gracie Abrams's The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour are set to go on general sale on Friday, 13th December at 10:00AM local time. However, you can also get tickets via presale using the information above. When you try for tickets, login to Ticketmaster, Live Nation or your venue's page 10 minutes before tickets go on sale.

Tickets are more expensive than Gracie's original The Secret of Us Tour run. This is likely down to the fact that Gracie's rise in fame over the past year.

For now, Gracie Abrams has announced six new The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour dates in North America and South America. Whether or not she announces any extra dates due to demand is yet to be seen. However, Gracie still has European, Asian and Australian dates left on the original The Secret of Us Tour. 
As it stands, Gracie is only taking The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour to cities in South America and North America. Based on the fact that she still has original tour dates left elsewhere in the world, it seems unlikely that she will add any additional locations. However, sign up to her mailing list via her website just in case.
