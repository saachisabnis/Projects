It’s the beginning of the end for the Eras Tour, as Taylor Swift performed the first two of her final concerts in Vancouver, Canada.
The pop star, 34, took the stage at BC Place on Friday, December 6, and again on Saturday, December 7, before her last-ever Eras Tour show on Sunday, December 8. While most of Saturday’s shows (including outfits) were repeated from the night before, Swift did have one new surprise up her sleeve.
“Tonight is the last opportunity Gracie [Abrams] and I have to perform together on this tour,” Swift said during her acoustic section on Saturday.
The two singers then performed Swift’s “Last Kiss” and Abrams’ “I Love You, I’m Sorry.” (They previously duetted during previous Eras shows in Cincinnati, London and Toronto, performing a mashup of their song “Us” off Abrams’ The Secret of Us album and Swift’s 1989 hit “Out of the Woods.”)
Swift has been on the Eras Tour since March 2023, when she kicked off the venture in Glendale, Arizona. When the tour concludes, she will have performed a total of 149 shows across 50 cities and five continents.
During her previous stop in Toronto, Swift became emotional on stage while receiving a standing ovation after “Champagne Problems.” She expressed her gratitude for her fans and the team that has supported her throughout the Eras Tour.
“We’re at the very end of this tour, so you doing that, you have no idea how much it means to me and to my band and to my crew and everybody who’s put so much of this into this tour,” she told the audience while wiping away tears and getting choked up. “I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore. I’m just having a bit of a moment. I’m sorry. It’s not even the last show!”
She continued: “My band, my crew [and] all my fellow performers, we have put so much of our lives into this, and you put so much of your lives into being with us tonight and to [be] giving us that moment that we will never forget. We have loved our time in Toronto; it’s been so amazing. I love you, guys, thank you so much for that.”
With the nearly two-year tour winding down, Swift has reportedly already made plans for her next era. According to a source who spoke exclusively to Us Weekly earlier this week, she hopes to hit the road again in 2026 for a scaled-back tour.
“She had such a great experience on Eras. She really wants to do it again,” the source revealed. “She loves being with all her fans; it inspires her.”
However, Swift’s schedule could change depending on her personal life. (She has been dating Travis Kelce since the summer of 2023, and fans have been eagerly awaiting news of their next steps.)
“Taylor does feel like Travis is The One, but jumping in is not her style,” the source said of a potential engagement for the couple. “That’s just not how she does [things]. Marriage is a big deal, and she wants [it to be] forever.”

A second insider told Us that while Swift and Kelce, 35, would both “love to be engaged,” they “aren’t rushing it.”
In the immediate aftermath of the tour’s conclusion, Swift “plans to stay in and hibernate [with Travis] for a while,” the insider shared, noting that they “want to do ‘normal things’ as a couple.”
“Taylor’s exhausted,” the insider added. “She’s excited for some relaxation and downtime.”
