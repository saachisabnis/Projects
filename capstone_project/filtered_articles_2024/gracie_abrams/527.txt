It’s reliably exciting to see celebrity couples show up at award shows, but back in January, the Emmy Awards exemplified an arguably even more heartwarming trend: the “family date.” Instead of your parents forcing you to go camping, say, the famous-person version is a little less crunchy and a little more glam—and it’s been my favorite theme of awards season.
The Emmys were a big night for family, from host Anthony Anderson tapping his IRL mom for bits (and to serve as the ceremony’s play-off music), to Succession stars Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin using their wins to talk about their love for their young children (and, in Culkin’s case, straight-up asking his wife if they could have more). More family fun would follow at the Grammy Awards (where the likes of Billy Joel, Gracie Abrams, Victoria Monét, and Dua Lipa all made next of kin their plus-ones); the SAG Awards (where Ali Wong called out her octogenarian mom from the stage); and at Sunday’s Academy Awards, where Ryan Gosling showed up with his sister and parents.
