TRNSMT has delighted fans by announcing 50 Cent, Biffy Clyro and Snow Patrol as a part of their 2025 line up for next year's festival.
Scotland's largest music festival is back for another year at Glasgow Green and is set to take place over three days from Friday July 11 to Sunday July 13, 2025.
TRNSMT took to X to tease fans about their big announcement today ahead of confirming the 2025 line up, live on @BBCR1 at 6:15PM.
50 Cent, Biffy Clyro, Snow Patrol, The Script, Fontaines D.C. and Gracie Abrams are among the first acts announced for the 2025 festival.
American rap icon 50 Cent will headline on the festival’s opening day, on Friday July 11.
Legendary Scottish band Biffy Clyro will headline Saturday bringing their festival-ready anthems to Glasgow Green.
Adopted homegrown heroes Snow Patrol will close the festival on Sunday, returning to Scotland following their The Forest Is The Path 2025 world tour.
With four stages across the park, including the Main stage, King Tut's Stage, River Stage and the Boogie Bar there are plenty of more big names to still be announced.
The Glasgow music festival, which first opened its doors in 2017, welcomed crowds of 120,000 in July 2024 and has only gotten bigger and better every year since.
This year's line up saw huge headliner acts take to the stage over the course of the weekend including Liam Gallagher, Gerry Cinnamon and Calvin Harris and One Direction star Niall Horan.
