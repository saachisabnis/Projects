What are Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift's 'Us' lyrics about? Here's what they've said about the song.
Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift's first ever collaboration 'Us' is finally here. What are their 'Us' lyrics actually about though?
As soon as Gracie Abrams announced the tracklist for her second studio album 'The Secret of Us', fans started losing it over Track 5: 'Us (featuring Taylor Swift)'. Taylor is notoriously selective when it comes to choosing her features but Gracie built up a friendship with Taylor supporting her on The Eras Tour and they secretly ended up in the studio together.
Taking to X/Twitter when the tracklist was announced, Gracie tweeted: "All I can tell you for now is that some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my whole entire life was writing this song together. Hands down. I am currently smiling and sweating thinking about it and I’ll never get over the shock of seeing this one on the tracklist. You know how I feel."
Unsurprisingly, 'Us' has immediately become a fan favourite. Here's what Gracie has said about the meaning behind it.
Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift write 'Us' together
In 'Us', Gracie and Taylor sing about a past relationship that burned bright and fast. Reflecting, Gracie sings: And if history's clear, someone always ends up in ruins / And what seemed like fate becomes 'What the hell was I doin'?. Taylor later adds: And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes / It must seem like fate, give it ten months and you'll be past it.
In the chorus, they both sing: I felt it, you held it / Do you miss us? Us? / Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us / Us, us, us, us, us, us. There's also a rousing Swiftian middle eight that goes: The curse of a miracle, curse of an oracle / You're incomparable, f--- you / What's happened to you? (You?) / Us, us, me, me, us.
Gracie told Billboard that she wrote 'Us' with Taylor after they played each other new music and listened to Aaron Dessner instrumentals together. She said: "Something caught our ear at the same time very hard and fast. So we ran to the piano and started writing this song...I used to fantasize about that kind of a thing as a kid."
Speaking to Billboard as well, Aaron added: "Taylor’s brilliant at synthesising a whole story. [That song] just brought everything [about Gracie’s album] into focus in a beautiful way."

Writing and releasing a song about an epic failed romance with the queen of writing songs about epic failed romances? Pretty legendary if you ask me.
