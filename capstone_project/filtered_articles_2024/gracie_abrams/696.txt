On September 13th, Dayglow gave the world Dayglow; the fourth, self-titled album by indie pop singer-songwriter and producer Sloan Struble (aka Dayglow). Less than a month after the release, on October 8th, Dayglow will be hitting Boston’s House of Blues as a stop on “Dayglow The Tour.” If you are looking for a night of joyful energy and maybe even a little “Crying on the Dancefloor,” that is the place you’ll want to be. Hardly anyone who has come across Dayglow’s music hasn’t become enraptured by the fun synths, bouncy instrumentals, and super sticky-silly-sentimental lyrics that make up his discography from “Can I Call You Tonight,” to “Every Little Thing I Say I Do.” If you have the chance, don’t miss out. Dayglow could very well be “Close To You.”

Excited for indie-pop princess Gracie Abrams to be "Close to You"? Soon, she’ll be in Boston! "I Knew It, I Know You" probably want to go see her! On October 9th, Gracie Abrams is going to be taking over MGM Music Hall at Fenway for The Secret of Us tour. Though she’s been on the scene since her release in 2020, Gracie has blown up in the past few years for her indie hits. The Los Angeles-born artist is touring for her new album of the exact same title that was released this past summer. If you love hit songs from the album including "I Love You, I’m Sorry" and "us.", you’ll be sure to have a rockin’ good time seeing her perform. Abrams won’t be hitting MGM alone, though. She’ll be supported by opener ROLE MODEL, who just released a new full-length album called Kansas Anymore this past July. While it might be impossible to get tickets to see Gracie at this moment, keep an eye out for prices dropping on ticket sites. If you get to see her, I wish you the "Best", though I pose one question: "Will you cry?"
