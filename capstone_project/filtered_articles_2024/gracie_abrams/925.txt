BUSH: Sixteen Turns 30
Bush's debut album, Sixteen Stone, marks its 30th anniversary today (Friday). Since its U.S. release on December 6th, 1994, it's sold over six-million copies. That figure was likely a surprise to Hollywood Records, as the label declined to release it earlier in 1994 because they didn't hear any hit singles. Sixteen Stone ended up spinning off five singles, all of which went Top 5 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock and Alternative charts. Two tracks, "Comedown" and "Glycerine," went to number one on the Alternative chart.
The first single from Sixteen Stone was "Everything's Zen" and includes lyrical references to songs by David Bowie, Tom Waits and Alice in Chains -- along with a very not nice brother. Frontman Gavin Rossdale says he'd gone back to his day job when the song was released as a single, and he didn't anticipate it being their breakthrough hit. “With ‘Everything’s Zen’ that’s the song that kicked it all off for us. For me I was back at work at my day job after recording that record, completing it and before it came out. So I’d gone back to work thinking that my legacy was there on the record and that was great. And then it all blew up, and that was the end of that.”
The last single from Sixteen Stone was "Machinehead," and Rossdale is still puzzled some of the lyrics he wrote. “I don’t know. I just think it’s just to do with the physicality of the riff. It just felt like it had that sense about it.”

Queens Of The Stone Age, Vampire Weekend And Kings Of Leon To Headline Victorious Festival 2025
The lineup for the 2025 Victorious Festival is out. Queens of The Stone Age, Vampire Weekend and Kings of Leon have been announced as the headliners.

LED ZEPPELIN: Doc Be Coming in February
The wait is over, at least for Led Zeppelin fans who live in a town that has an IMAX theater. That's because their documentary, Becoming Led Zeppelin, will open on IMAX screens in close to 200 theaters on February 7th. The film tells the story of how the band came together, but, according to Allison McGourty, the film's writer and producer, it wasn't easy to make due to the lack of footage from those early days.
“We spent five years flying back and forth across the Atlantic scouring attics and basements in pursuit of rare and unseen film footage, photographs and music recordings. Then we transferred each piece of media with custom techniques, so that in IMAX, these 55-year-old clips and music would look and sound like they came out of the lab yesterday.”
Becoming Led Zeppelin, which premiered in 2021 in Italy at the Venice Film Festival and in Colorado at the Telluride Film Festival, before producers added more material, takes us up to their second album, Led Zeppelin 2. Included in the film is:
· Unreleased footage of them performing at the Atlanta Pop Festival on July 5th, 1969
· Home footage from 1968 of John Bonham and his family
· "A never-before-heard interview with John Bonham,” which according to LedZepNews.com is "misleading," as "the interview heard throughout the film and included in the trailer is a 1972 Australian radio interview with Robert Plant and Bonham that has been widely available for years, including online and through vinyl bootlegs." And, in one section he's actually talking about The Beatles at Shea Stadium, but producers will make you think he's referring to Zeppelin.
Ahead of its premiere on February 7th, IMAX Theatres in 18 markets will be holding one night only early access screenings on February 5th. Tickets are on sale for both dates now at Imax.com/LedZeppelin.
SAMMY HAGAR: Auctioning Another Car 
Sammy Hagar is parting with another car from his collection. This time it's a 1962 Ford Thunderbird that belonged to his former bandleader, the late Ronnie Montrose. Hagar says Ronnie used to drive them to Montrose shows in it. It will be sold at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona on January 17th, where Sammy, Michael Anthony, guitarist Vic Johnson and drummer Kenny Aronoff will perform. Hagar restored the black car with red interior back to its original condition, and it has its original engine and drive train. Proceeds from the auction will go to suicide prevention in memory of Montrose, who took his life in 2012. He was 64.
Hagar was at the Scottsdale auction in October, where he sold his 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari for $4.7 million, which set a world auction record.
