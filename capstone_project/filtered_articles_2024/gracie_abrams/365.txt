	Gracie Abrams and Heidi Gardner are big fans of Chris Rock in an unexpected way.

	Rock is set to host Saturday Night Live this weekend, with Abrams as the musical guest. In a new promo for the episode released on Thursday (Dec. 12), Gardner tells the comedian that he stars in both her and Abrams’ “absolute favorite movie in the world.”

	Rock listed Madagascar and the Grown Ups franchise as the films he assumed they were talking about, but Abrams surprised him when she revealed that the movie in question was actually 2001’s Pootie Tang, with Gardner quoting his “Wa-Da-Tah” line.

	The “I Miss You, I’m Sorry” singer-songwriter is making her first-ever appearance on SNL, while Rock will be hosting the show for a fourth time. The performance will cap off an explosive year for Abrams, who closed out her time opening for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour earlier this month. Since its release in October, her song “That’s So True” has gained serious momentum, thanks in part to a boost from TikTok virality. The track peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.
