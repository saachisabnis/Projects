From Netflix’s “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” and “Grotesquerie” on FX to “NCIS: Origins” on CBS and NBC’s “St. Denis Medical”
Fall marks the start of the traditional TV season. And while streaming has made television a year-round spectacle, an avalanche of new and returning series make this autumn feel more special than recent years.
Hollywood’s content contraction, along with the post-pandemic and strike landscape results in less shows overall. But upcoming streaming, cable and broadcast offerings come with such promise that we had to double our traditional preview to fit a fraction of the noteworthy titles set to premiere in the coming months. Ryan Murphy is set to take over the conversation with four new shows across three networks — including FX’s “American Sports Story: Aaron Hernandez” and “Grotesquerie,” Netflix’s “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” and ABC’s “Doctor Odyssey” — while returning favorites like “Abbott Elementary,” “The Diplomat” and “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon” will keep fans entertained as the air starts to cool. Then there’s other new highlights like FX’s “English Teacher,” Fox’s “Rescue: HI-Surf” and HBO’s “Dune: Prophecy” hoping to conquer our hearts and attention.
Check out TheWrap’s staff picks for the 60 most anticipated shows set for release this fall.
Prepare for one of the sharpest and most refreshing comedies of the season with Brian Jordan Alvarez and Stephanie Koenig’s “English Teacher.” The FX original follows Evan Marquez (Alvarez), a high school teacher in Austin, Texas, as he juggles the personal and political struggles that come with working in education these days. On the surface, “English Teacher” isn’t too dissimilar from school-based comedies that have come before like “Abbott Elementary” and “A.P. Bio.” But where “English Teacher” shines is through its confident comedic voice, which always dodges the expected punchline and political stance. Also from “What We Do in the Shadows” EP Paul Simms and “Portlandia” EP Jonathan Krisel, “English Teacher” is somehow consistently able to make even the thorniest issue laugh-out-loud funny. — Kayla Cobb
Hulu’s soapy drama series “Tell Me Lies” is back just in time for the back-to-school season. After the Season 1 finale saw Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen DeMarco (Jackson White) implode their already toxic relationship, Season 2 will pick up with the couple broken up, with Lucy resolving over the summer to shake off the drama as she returns to college. As expected, it won’t be that simple, and the exes enter a new type of toxic entanglement as they refuse to let their history go. Season 2 will also dive back into the friend group’s drama as well as introduce a new love interest for Lucy played by “The Descendants” and “Gossip Girl” reboot alum Thomas Doherty. — Loree Seitz
Kevin Hart, Samuel L. Jackson and Taraji P. Henson star in the new Peacock series “Fight Night: Million Dollar Heist.” The limited series is based on the acclaimed true crime podcast “Fight Night” by iHeartPodcasts, Doghouse Pictures and Will Packer Media. Set in Atlanta, the show chonicles how an armed robbery during the night of Muhammad Ali’s historic 1970 comeback fight led to an underground heist that changed his life for good. The series is created and written by Shaye Ogbonna, who also wrote for “Penguin,” “The Chi” and “God’s Country.” — Tess Patton
If you missed your fix of murder and betrayal in the backdrop of an uber rich family with a laundry lists of scandalous secrets this summer, Netflix’s “The Perfect Couple” is sure to scratch that “Big Little Lies” or “The White Lotus” itch — especially as it stars the queen of the genre, Nicole Kidman. Based on Elin Hilderbrand’s bestselling novel of the same name, the Netflix series features an all-star cast that also includes Liev Schreiber, Eve Hewson, Meghann Fahy, Dakota Fanning and Jack Reynor, among others. Hewson stars as Amelia Sacks, who is about to marry into a buttoned up Nantucket family, that is, until a member of the wedding party washes up dead the morning of the wedding. As a murder investigation takes over the town, Amelia finds herself at odds with the family’s matriarch (Kidman) and the rest of the family, including her fiancé, as she seeks justice. — LS
Fox is expanding its Animation Domination lineup with a new show from Adam and Craig Malamut. “Universal Basic Guys” revolves around two brothers, Mark and Hank Hoagies (Adam Malamut), who both lose their jobs to automation. When they’re given $3,000 a month thanks to a new basic income program, they start to devote their free time to finding purpose in a world where they’re no longer needed. The upcoming animated series also stars Fred Armisen, Ally Maki and Talia Genevieve. — KC
If your fall is full of spooky movies and dramatic shows, Natasha Rothwell’s “How to Die Alone” will be the perfect, heartwarming chaser. Rothwell, who created and executive produced the series, stars as Mel, a down-on-her-luck 30-something airport worker who never gave herself a real shot at living. After coming face-to-face with her own mortality, she embraces the life she was given and changes it how she sees fit. The feel-good series also stars Conrad Ricamora, Jocko Sims and KeiLyn Durrel Jones. — LS
The path “Three Women” took to its premiere is almost as emotionally stressful as its central premise. After being filmed for Showtime, which decided not to air the completed series, the drama was picked up by Starz. Based on the book of the same name by Lisa Taddeo, “Three Women” centers around Gia (Shailene Woodley), a writer who’s actively searching for her book. While examining sex and sexuality, she finds compelling stories in three different women: Sloane (DeWanda Wise), a sexually adventurous wife in an open relationship; Lina (Betty Gilpin), a woman desperate for affection who’s trapped in a loveless marriage; and Maggie (Gabrielle Creevy), a young woman whose first experience with romance or sex happens with her high school English teacher. Equal parts vulnerable and daring, “Three Women” stands as a rarely-explored deep dive into the complexities of female sexuality and desire. — KC
Dwight “The General” Manfredi (played effortlessly by Sylvester Stallone), the New York hood who, upon being released from prison is sent to start a new racket in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is back. And we couldn’t be happier. At the end of the first season, Dwight was arrested, but promotional materials have already shown that he is out pretty quickly and back to his old ways. It’s a little bit like Terence Winter, the “Sopranos” veteran who seemingly left the series before season 2 started production, only to be pulled back into the ”Tulsa King” orbit. (He wrote or co-wrote 7 of the 10 episodes this season.) What’s especially exciting is that Stallone has co-written the first and final episode this year. You know, the man who wrote “Rocky”! “Tulsa King” has survived a writers’ strike, actors’ strike, reports from the set about Stallone’s questionable behavior, and the galactic expansion of Taylor Sheridan’s television empire. Get ready for it. — Drew Taylor
If you missed Dee in “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” or can’t get enough of Kaitlin Olson in “Hacks,” the actress will soon lead her own TV show with ABC’s “High Potential.” Based on French series “Haut Potentiel Intellectuel (HPI),” the hourlong comedy-drama stars Olson as Morgan, a single mom with an exceptional mind whose intellectual need to solve problems has led to instability in her personal and professional life. When a janitor gig gives Morgan the chance to solve a crime, the local police force pursues a partnership that puts her perceptive intuition to good use. The series also stars Daniel Sunjata, Javicia Leslie, Deniz Akdeniz, Amirah J, Matthew Lamb and Judy Reyes. — LS
Ryan Murphy’s TV empire expands with another FX anthology series, this time set within the dramatic world of American sports. The first installment stars Josh Andrés Rivera (“West Side Story”) as the titular NFL player Aaron Hernandez, chronicling his meteoric rise in the sport to become a New England Patriots superstar, and his scandalous downfall following his arrest and conviction for the murder of Odin Lloyd. The 10-episode limited series explores how Aaron’s upbringing, identity and internal turmoil led to his tragic fall from grace. The show also stars, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Lindsay Mendez, Tony Yazbeck, Jake Cannavale, Catfish Jean, Jaylen Barron, Tammy Blanchard, Ean Castellanos, Thomas Sadoski, Norbert Leo Butz, Kwadarrius Smith and Casey Sullivan. — Jose Alejandro Bastidas
Fans first met Kathryn Hahn’s Agatha back in “WandaVision,” as a powerful witch determined to steal Wanda Maximoff’s (Elizabeth Olsen) powers for herself. But in the end, Wanda turned the tables on her, trapping Agatha in her Westview persona of nosy neighbor Agnes and without powers. But, now that Wanda is seemingly gone, Agatha is free of her spell and determined to get her power back. That means forming a coven apparently, with Sasheer Zamata, Aubrey Plaza, Patti Lupone, Ali Ahn, Joe Locke and Debra Jo Rupp. As Lupone’s character notes in the trailer, no witch “in her right mind” would join Agatha’s coven — then again, Agatha’s not looking for people in their right mind. What could go wrong? — Andi Ortiz
ABC introduced the first ever “Golden Bachelor” last fall, and it quickly became an immediate sensation and ratings hit with “Bachelor” nation and beyond. What captivated audiences even more than Gerry Turner’s journey for love was the compassion displayed by the 22 senior women, who could be seen helping each other prepare for dates or playing “Never Have I Ever” over pints of ice cream. Now, one of those beloved women — Joan Vassos — is embarking on her own love story. The 61-year-old will date 24 men in their late 50s and 60s, including Mark Anderson, the father of “Bachelor” royalty Kelsey Anderson, who got engaged to Joey Graziadei during his season of “The Bachelor.” — LS
Spinning out of Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” and taking place shortly after the film’s conclusion, “The Penguin” puts Colin Farrel back into his unrecognizable makeup to expand the world of Gotham City’s seedy underbelly. He’s joined by Cristin Milioti as his character Oswald Cobblepot – aka The Penguin – tries to take control of Gotham’s underworld in the wake of The Riddler’s attack on the city. For fans waiting for the next Batman film, the HBO series also bridges the gap between the two, making it even more required viewing. — Jacob Bryant
On the evening of Aug. 20, 1989, Lyle Menendez called 9-1-1 as his brother screamed in the background and told authorities that his parents had been murdered. Thus began one of the most discussed cases of the ‘90s, which has come to set the tone for how true crime is discussed and consumed even now. As the prosecution argued the brothers killed their parents to inherit their vast fortune, the defense countered that the already-rich siblings actually did so in self-defense, after suffering through a lifetime of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The second season after 2022’s “Monster — Dahmer: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” “The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” stars Nicholas Chavez and Cooper Koch as Lyle and Erik, respectively, as well as Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny as parents José and Kitty Menendez. As is the case with “Dahmer,” this Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan drama will ask viewers to question who the real monsters are in this real-life horror story. — KC
Gird your loins, Zack Snyder’s first adult animated series for Netflix is upon us. “Twilight of the Gods,” co-created by Snyder, Jay Oliva and Eric Carrasco, is inspired by Norse mythology, with dueling gods, giants and humans spilling blood and sharing beds. (The first episode features, among other things, a graphic cunnilingus scene and an action set piece that sees Thor killing a bunch of children — we’re a long way from goofy Chris Hemsworth territory.) The series follows a group of humans who go on a quest to kill one of the gods and the voice cast includes Sylvia Hoeks, Pilou Asbæk, John Noble, Peter Stormare, Jamie Chung and Corey Stoll. The beautiful, stylized animation was provided by French studio Xilam, who bring all manner of perversity to eye-popping life. (This project feels particularly indebted to Snyder’s north star, John Boorman’s “Excalibur.”) There was originally an animated spinoff of Snyder’s “Army of the Dead” planned for Netflix. That project was unfortunately canceled after much planning. But “Twilight of the Gods” should scratch that itch. It’s everything you could possibly want from a Zack Snyder animated series and much more. It will also hold you over until the next iteration of “Primal” appears. Or at least quench your thirst for blood. — DT
Tucked away on MGM+ with “Challengers” is one of the best horror shows you’re probably not watching. Entering its third season this fall, “From” is a completely addicting, spooky little mystery box that balances its endless questions with satisfying answers and a town full of fascinating characters stuck in rustic hell. Harrold Perrineau stars as Boyd Stevens, the de-facto Sheriff and leadership figure of a little side-road town that traps anyone who enters — and has an infestation of monsters that come out at night, ripping the townspeople apart whenever they get a chance. And that’s just the start of the weird stuff. It’s got a great concept, a Stephen King-like small-town Americana horror vibe and a compelling set of mysteries befitting the “Lost” pedigree of the behind-the-scenes team, all punctuated by moments of shocking gore that never lose their power to send a sharp shock down your spine. — Haleigh Foutch
Can’t get enough action-packed rescue shows? This one follows lifeguards in Hawaii who monitor the North Shore of O’ahu, the most famous and dangerous stretch of coastline in the world. We’re expecting a Hawaiian twist on (former) Fox series “9-1-1,” and you’ll recognize cast regular Arielle Kebbel for playing firefighter Lucy Donato on “9-1-1.” The show is from “ER” creator John Wells and executive producer/writer Matt Kester of TNT’s “Animal Kingdom.” It will premiere in a special post-football timeslot on Sunday, Sept. 22, before going to its regular time Mondays starting Sept. 23. — Sharon Knolle
The beloved legal drama is returning to TV — this time led by the incomparable Kathy Bates. While there’s not too much of a link between the original “Matlock” series and CBS’ reboot, the new drama series follows Matlock (Bates), who uses her unassuming demeanor to snag a job at a prestigious law firm, where she enters a strange dynamic with the firm’s top lawyers (Skye P. Marshall, Jason Ritter and Beau Bridges) — who are also entangled through familial and romantic ties. Matlock navigates the sensitive relationships and works to get into the good graces of her boss, Olympia (Marshall) as works to expose corruption from the inside. “Jane the Virgin” creator Jennie Snyder Urman EPs the series. After its post-football debut on Sept. 22, the show will settle into its regular timeslot Oct. 17. — LS
Inspired by the life and work of author and physician Oliver Sacks, “Brilliant Minds” centers on neurologist Dr. Oliver Wolf (Zachary Quinto) and his interns as they solve the mystery of the human mind, while navigating their own relationships and mental health. Dr. Wolf struggles with face blindness, a rare condition that enables him to understand his patient’s in a unique way, and opens up the minds of his colleagues. Also starring Tamberla Perry, Ashleigh LaThrop, Alex MacNicoll, Aury Krebs, Spence Moore II, Teddy Sears and Donna Murphy, “Brilliant Minds” is created, written and executive produced by Michael Grassi (“Riverdale,” “Katy Keene”), with Greg Berlanti also serving as an EP. — LS
Have you ever felt the urge to leave it all behind? Mark Duplass and Mel Eslyn’s fascinating new indie series explores that idea through the eyes of a teenage girl. After seemingly hearing the call from the wild, Penelope (Megan Stott) decides to say goodbye to her parents and regular life to build a new one while hiking in a National Park. The young adult series was produced independently and later sold to Netflix for U.S. distribution. It also stars Austin Abrams, Krisha Fairchild and Rhenzy Feliz. — JAB
Tis the season for new Ryan Murphy shows. Created by Murphy, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, this FX horror drama stars Niecy Nash as Detective Lois Tryon. As more and more disturbing crimes begin to unfold in her small community, Lois begins to suspect the horror may actually be more personal than she thinks. To try and balance her complicated home life with this upsetting case, she partners with Sister Megan (Micaela Diamond), a local nun and journalist for the Catholic Guardian. As the two work together, they find themselves spun tighter into a sinister web that provides more questions than answers. In addition to Nash and Diamond, “Grotesquerie” stars Courtney B. Vance, Lesley Manville, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Raven Goodwin and Travis Kelce in one of his first acting roles. — KC
If you’re needing a fun story about unlikely love then Netflix’s “Nobody Wants This” has you covered. The series stars Kristen Bell as a “Call Her Daddy”-esque podcast host who’s unlucky in love, and Adam Brody as a rabbi who’s looking for something more than the relationships he’s been given. Despite all the odds, and many urgings from the friends and family on both sides, the two make for an excellent pair and their chemistry onscreen is a perfect way to enter the Fall TV season in style. — JB
We expect “Love Boat”-esque romances and a “9-1-1” level of disasters on this new ABC series from Ryan Murphy Productions. Joshua Jackson stars as Dr. Max Bankman, who’s hired to keep the wealthy passengers of a luxury cruise ship happy and healthy. Of course, that’s easier said than done on the open seas, which opens up so many possibilities for things to go wrong. The drama anchors Thursday nights on ABC along with another Murphy production, “9-1-1” and medical staple “Grey’s Anatomy,” now in its 21st season. The captain of the ship is none other than “Miami Vice” and “Knives Out” star Don Johnson, while the supporting cast includes Phillipa Soo of “Hamilton” fame and Sean Teale of Netflix’s “Who Killed Erin Carter?” All aboard! — SK
On Oct. 11, 1975, NBC made history by airing the first episode of a late night sketch show called “Saturday Night Live.” Fifty years later, NBC is about to do it again with the 50th season of its comedy staple. Little is known about this upcoming season other than Maya Rudolph will be returning to play Kamala Harris and that Punkie Johnson and Molly Kearney are no longer part of the cast. But if it’s anything like the series’ 40th anniversary, fans can expect surprise appearances from beloved alumni, celebrity cameos and big musical guests. This upcoming historic season will then culminate with a three-hour celebratory special retrospective, which is set to air Feb. 16, 2025. — KC
Setting aside the unseemly punctuation gymnastics of a title intent on impossible-to-miss franchise branding, the second season of “The Walking Dead’s” Daryl Dixon spinoff promises an emotional punch with the return of Melissa McBride as OG character Carol. The series was originally envisioned to feature the fan-favorite pair before McBride temporarily opted out, and now, we finally get to see one of the most tender relationships in the long-running series take the spotlight. That approach worked out very well for the Rick and Michonne-centric “The Ones Who Live,” and the first season of “Daryl Dixon” brought its own quieter spin on the zombie apocalypse. If “Book of Carol” can hold onto that signature wavelength while digging into the dynamic between these two beloved characters, it has the potential to be one of the franchise’s most rewarding efforts to date. — HF
For CBS to sacrifice part of its reality TV trifecta in favor of a new entry, “The Summit” has very big hiking boots to fill. Replacing “The Amazing Race” this fall, the newest adventure competition set in New Zealand throws 16 (mostly) ordinary Americans — and viewers — straight into a 100-plus-mile, 14-day trek up a mountain with their share of $1 million hanging in the balance. The twist: The climbers can only win if they meet their 2-week deadline as a team, meaning they’ll have to cut the weaker links — or perhaps, make more devious decisions along the way. While the concept is not especially novel, this American iteration of the Australian series does prove to be decidedly carnal, meaning the audience can expect emotionally driven storytelling and some epic blindsides à la “Survivor” and “Big Brother.” Plus, it stars the ever-charming Manu Bennett from “Arrow” as host, which is just another reason to watch. Although, there’s also an omnipotent being known as The Mountain’s Keeper who overlooks the environment and enacts the many twists, only the show chooses to depict her character in the form of a pilotless helicopter, so peaks and valleys. The show will land into its regular timeslot on Oct. 16, following its special premiere on Sept. 29. — JD Knapp
Prepare for a more serious and prestigious side of The CW. Created by Anna Symon for ITVX and the American broadcaster, this series stars Sophie Turner (“Game of Thrones”) as Joan Hannington, a woman who became Britain’s most notorious diamond thief. The six-part crime drama will follow Joan’s transformation from housewife and mother, to petty offender, to diamond thief and finally to one of the preeminent criminal masterminds of the 1980s. The upcoming series also stars Frank Dillane, Laura Aikman, Alex Blake, Kirsty J. Curtis and Gershwyn Eustache Jr. and is an adaptation of Hannington’s 2004 memoir “I Am What I Am: The True Story of Britain’s Most Notorious Jewel Thief.” — KC
The beloved Netflix series will resume the love story between Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) as they continue to solidify their feelings for one another, with Season 2 leaving off just before the pair could muster up the courage to say “I love you.” As the friends grow up, “Heartstopper” Season 3 will dive into some more mature themes as well, including Charlie’s mental health struggles, sex and the group’s hopes for university. Season 3 also adds Jonathan Bailey (“Fellow Travelers,” “Bridgerton,” “Wicked”), Hayley Atwell (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” “Captain America: The First Avenger”) and Eddie Marsan (“Happy-Go-Lucky,” “Franklin”). — LS
The CW is jumping into the world of game shows this fall with two new series: “Trivial Pursuit” and “Scrabble.” Hosted by LeVar Burton, “Trivial Pursuit” reimagines the question-filled classic as a giant board game. At 9 p.m. ET/PT on Mondays, contestants battle it out over a range of categories in order to win wedges to beat each other to the center. The victor then has to race against the clock for the jackpot. This new game show will be preceded by the Raven-Symoné-hosted “Scrabble.” Each episode follows contestants as they battle it out over a giant game board to prove who’s the master wordsmith. — KC
The final season of “Superman & Lois” hits The CW in October and brings the era of DC Comics television to an official end on the channel. The final season is putting its own spin on the famous “Death of Superman” comic book arc, with Clark presumed dead after his battle with Doomsday. Jordan’s inherited Kryptonian powers come into bloom just in time for him to take the battle to Michael Cudlitz’s Lex Luthor, while the world remains split on whether Superman is really dead or not. — JB
Ever get nostalgic for your middle school civics bee? Well, this PBS four-part docuseries follows teenagers as they compete in the nation’s largest civics competition, “We the People.” High school students from across the country with diverse upbringings and political backgrounds grapple with questions of democracy and what it means to be civil. In an election year, this docuseries highlights the definition of democracy for a new generation. – TP
Broadcast TV’s most lauded show will return for its fourth season this fall — and will be diving into uncharted territory. After hitting the breaks on Janine (Quinta Brunson) and Gregory (Tyler James Williams) ahead of last season, the Season 3 finale re-opened the door for their romance as the pair shared a kiss that Brunson told TheWrap marked a “cognitive decision” for both characters. If our guess is correct, Season 4 will see Janine and Gregory navigate their budding relationship in and out of school alongside their teacher pals, played by the beloved Sheryl Lee Ralph, Lisa Ann Walter, Chris Perfetti and Janelle James, who we’re sure will be up to antics of their own. — LS
Horror maestro James Wan brings us this intriguing looking series about neighbors in rural Georgia who must work together to survive a mysterious threat… something that requires them to wear gas masks, as we see in the first trailer. It’s based on the New York Times bestselling novel Stinger by Robert McCammon. It stars Scott Speedman of “Animal Kingdom,” “Handmaid’s Tale” actress Yvonne Strahovski  and “Blindspot” actor Chaske Spencer. — SK
Netflix is taking a shot at the “Tomb Raider” franchise as part of its continuing expansion into video game adaptations. “The Legend of Lara Croft” takes place after the events of the 2018 video game “Shadow of the Tomb Raider.” Focusing on Lara Croft’s past as well as her interpersonal relationships, it bridges the gap between the reboot trilogy and the original series of games. The upcoming animated series comes from Tasha Huo, known for her work on “The Witcher: Blood Origin,” and stars Hayley Atwell as the iconic action heroine. — KC
The mystery at the center of Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón’s TV debut plays like a prestigious telenovela, peeling away the truth while also ridding viewers of their own biases. Cate Blanchett stars as a world-renowned documentary filmmaker, known for unmasking her high-profile subjects’ darkest secrets, whose life starts to unravel after learning a terrible moment from her own past is at risk of going public in a new novel. The show keeps you guessing up to the last minute, making for a must-watch binge for the fall. Along with Blanchett, the star-studded cast includes Kevin Kline, Lesley Manville, Sacha Baron Cohen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Louis Partridge and HoYeon Jung. — JAB
The “NCIS” universe is going retro with its latest spinoff! The 90s-set “Origins” takes viewers to the early days of the NIS, following as Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Austin Stowell) joins the organization as a special agent following the death of his wife.

The show, executive produced by Sean and Mark Harmon, also stars Mariel Molino, Tyla Abercrumbie, Caleb Martin Foote and Diany Rodriguez. Mark Harmon serves as narrator. It is set to air right after its flagship series “NCIS,” which has a tense cliffhanger to solve in the Season 22 premiere involving Katrina Law’s Jessica Knight. — JAB

The first three episodes will premiere on Oct, 16 on Prime Video with weekly releases to follow. — TP
“Scrubs” creator Bill Lawrence has brought back his dark therapy comedy “Shrinking” for a second season on Apple TV+. At the center of the series is Jimmy Laird (Jason Segel), a therapist who is getting over the death of his wife Tia (Lilan Bowden). As he sorts through his own grief, he becomes more dedicated to helping shape out his whacky clients’ lives while he sorts through his own personal drama. In the midst of it, he relies on his village: His next door neighbor Liz (Christa Miller), his coworker Gaby (Jessica Williams) and his bestie Michael Urie. Last season, the show ended with a cliffhanger — pun intended — as his client Grace (Heidi Gardner) pushed her abusive boyfriend off a cliff. — Raquel “Rocky” Harris
“Big Bang Theory” and “Young Sheldon” fans, it’s your time to shine — again. The Chuck Lorre-created franchise will debut a new spinoff series when “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” comes to CBS this fall.

Starring Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, Mark Proksch and Kristen Schaal, this FX comedy started with a group of vampire roommates who were supposed to take over the new world but sort of forgot once they hit Staten Island. It’s been a wild five seasons filled with cursed hats, vampiric nightclubs, spooky houses, werewolves and grotesque experiments, and it’s all set to come to an end with this sixth and final season. Don’t be sad the vampire mockumentary is ending. Be happy Jackie Daytona happened in the first place. — KC

The Keri Russell-led political thriller will return for its second season this fall, with its new installment promising to amp up the drama. The first season introduced Russell as diplomat Kate Wyler, who was unexpectedly appointed as US ambassador to the UK, prompting her to move to London alongside her husband and fellow career diplomat, Hal (Rufus Sewell). After Kate was called up to defuse a terrorist situation as a British aircraft carrier was blown up, Season 1 concludes with the shocking revelation that the call was coming from inside the house, with British PM Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) instigating the order. Just as dramatic was the car explosion at the end of Season 1, which left Hal and MP Merritt Grove (Simon Chandler) in peril. Not only will Season 2 explore the aftermath of the explosion — and Kate’s discovery — but it will also add Allison Janney into the mix as she joins the show as Vice President Grace Penn. — LS

It’s positively insane that one of the most popular series on television last aired a new episode on January 1, 2023. But “Yellowstone,” Taylor Sheridan’s thrilling modern western that chronicles a family fighting to protect their hugely coveted parcel of Montana land, has been embroiled in high stakes behind-the-scenes drama. When the series comes back for six new episodes this fall (technically the back half of season 5), it will do so without Kevin Costner, as patriarch John Dutton III, who left the show over scheduling concerns and a very public falling out with Sheridan over the star’s commitment to his own western saga “Horizon.” What this season will look and, more importantly, feel like, remains shrouded in mystery. But the next iteration of the franchise, “The Madison,” has begun casting with, so far, no performers from the flagship series. It’s just a thrill to have “Yellowstone” back, with or without Costner. We will be cherishing these six episodes, as the fate of the main show remains uncertain with reports of a potential Season 6. Hey, “Yellowstone” is known for its shocking deaths and abrupt twists after all. — DT
Mockumentary-style comedies are nothing new on TV, but NBC’s “St. Denis Medical” managed to make the concept feel fresh, with an added dose of endless laughter.

Though medical dramas have been more prevalent in recent years, “St. Denis” proves there’s plenty of hilarity to be found in the world of doctors, nurses and their supervisors. Let’s not let this masterpiece get lost in the broadcast TV wasteland. — JAB

The Apple TV+ dystopian sci-fi adaptation “Silo” is so good, and fans who tuned into the finale last fall have been waiting with bated breath to see how that cliffhanger unfurls. What’s outside the silo? Who’s outside the silo? While Season 1 unpacked many of the mysteries within this story, there’s far more to answer in Season 2 as the scope of the show expands. Based on a series of novels, the story takes place in a world in which humanity lives underground in a giant silo. The landscape above is desolate. Society functions like a machine, everyone serving their purpose. Rebecca Ferguson is the ultimate reluctant hero, an engineer on the lowest level who, by a twist of fate, is named sheriff and summoned to the upper levels where she discovers conspiracy after conspiracy. Now she’s… well if you haven’t watched, we won’t spoil it. Suffice it to say we’re excited. — Adam Chitwood

Based on “Boomtown,” a Texas Monthly podcast from 2019, “Landman” stars Billy Bob Thornton as a crisis executive at an oil company.

Also cause for excitement? The ridiculously starry supporting cast includes Ali Larter, Demi Moore, Jon Hamm, Andy Garcia, Michael Peña and James Jordan. Stop drilling. You’ve struck oil. — DT
