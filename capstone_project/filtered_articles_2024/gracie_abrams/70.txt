In what Swift called "the last opportunity that Gracie and I have to perform together on this tour"
Taylor Swift has performed with Gracie Abrams during her final leg of her blockbuster ‘The Eras Tour’. Watch footage of that moment below.
Swift, who is wrapping up her lengthy ‘Eras’ trek with three dates at Vancouver, British Columbia’s BC Place Stadium, brought out the young singer-songwriter, whom she collaborated with on ‘Us’, taken from Abrams’ latest album ‘The Story Of Us’.
In November, the song was nominated at the Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, where it will be up against the likes of Beyoncé & Post Malone’s ‘Levii’s Jeans’ and Charli XCX & Billie Eilish’s ‘Guess’.
The duo previously performed the song live at an ‘Eras’ date in Toronto last month (November 16), mashed up with Swift’s ‘Out Of The Woods’.
This time, they performed a mash-up of Abrams’ ‘I Love You, I’m Sorry’ and Swift’s ‘Last Kiss’, taken from her 2010 album ‘Speak Now’. Swift celebrated their reunion, telling fans that this was “the last opportunity that Gracie and I have to perform together on this tour.”
Footage of the performance has since been shared by fans, which you can find below.

Earlier this week, it was revealed that a book about the ‘Eras’ tour sold more than 800,000 copies in its first weekend of release.
Meanwhile, Swift recently shared her reaction to ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ achieving the most streamed album of 2024 on Apple Music earlier this week (December 3).
The streaming platform shared its year-end charts for 2024, which reveal the biggest songs of the year by Apple Music streams, Shazam tags, radio spins, read lyrics and more.
The results reveal that the expanded edition of Swift’s eleventh studio album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology’ – which NME gave three stars – was the most streamed album this year on the platform. Additionally, Swift was also awarded the most streamed artist.

In July, it was revealed that ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ was the biggest album of the year so far in the US, earning 4.66 million equivalent album units in the first half of this year. It also became the first album by a woman to spend its first 12 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 chart.
Album cut ‘But Daddy I Love Him’ was also listed as one of NME‘s 50 best songs of 2024. Puah Ziwei wrote: “The world’s biggest pop star returns to country storytelling for a grown-up ‘Love Story’ that hilariously rebuffs hand-wringing from fans and press alike over her personal life choices.”
“Dramatic and satirical, self-aware but not self-serious, this ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ centrepiece is a classic showcase of Taylor Swift’s flair for confessional, poetic lyricism.”
Last Friday (November 29), the vinyl edition of ‘The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology’ was made available to purchase for international fans. Swift revealed its release in a social media post reflecting on the “incredible” shows of her ‘Eras’ tour.
“The emotions have gotten pretty heightened for me and the rest of the team because it’s gotten extremely real for us: Our next city will be the last one of The Eras Tour, and the closing of the most extraordinary chapter of my life so far,” she said of its last three dates in Vancouver that begin this Friday (December 6).
