During Gracie Abrams’ conversation with frequent collaborator Audrey Hobert for Spotify’s “You’re Invited, I’m Sorry: An Evening with Gracie Abrams” event, the pop superstar revealed that the pair wrote a crass version of the Billboard Top 15 hit single, “That’s So True,” that the public will never hear. While discussing the song’s origins, Hobert discloses, “We were drunk when we wrote the lyrics,” with Abrams adding, “Yeah, there’s a whole, very vulgar version… that will never see the light of day!” Even if fans won’t ever get the chance to listen to the filthy version, apparently Mumford & Sons have heard it. Abrams said they were writing “That’s So True” on the roof of Electric Lady Studios, “just doubled over in tears, laughing so hard, saying the most horrific sh*t to song,” Abrams shared. Lee Foster, who runs Electric Lady, sent a text to Abrams saying “Mumford & Sons are doing an interview right above you.” “It was bad,” Abrams recalled. (Rolling Stone)
