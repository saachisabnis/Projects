Gladiators heartthrob Paul Mescal is ‘officially’ coupled up with singer Gracie Abrams after a smooch-filled date in London.
Rumours have been swirling that the two were getting close, but a daytime stroll around the capital appears to have confirmed things.
Sources said the duo put on a ‘loved up display’ as they browsed high-end stores in Mayfair before heading to a nearby park.
Paul, 28, was dressed in his signature short shorts and a t-shirt while Gracie, 24, wore a white vest top and black trousers.
They held hands as they were spotted walking together, with the Normal People star attempting to keep low-key in a cap and sunglasses.
Onlookers told the MailOnline the new couple weren’t ‘shy’ about their feelings as they kissed in the sunshine after months of secretive dates.
Reports of their romance first bloomed in October before the pair were spotted dining together at the Michelin-starred London pop-up restaurant Brat in June.
Then came another London shopping date, with a source telling The Sun at the time: ‘Paul and Gracie looked like any other young couple hitting the shops, and they went almost unnoticed. 
‘They seemed very relaxed in each other’s company and were busy checking out the posh shops on Bond Street. 
‘Paul is a very low-key person, as is Gracie, so there was no fanfare and they kept their distance from each other when they were out on the street’.
The couple popped up again together at Mitksi’s All Points East set on Sunday, standing next to each other in the crowd — again staying very low-key.

Gracie rose to prominence through TikTok before reaching wider popularity as an opening act for Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour tour.
She has recently been on tour with Taylor Swift, playing their collaboration song Us live for the first time at the Eras Tour in London in June.
The daughter of Star Wars icon JJ Abrams also received a Grammy newcomer nod for her 2023 debut album Good Riddance.
Paul was previously in a relationship with singer Phoebe Bridgers, who is now dating comedian Bo Burnham.
Paul and Phoebe are thought to have split in December 2022 after two years of dating, although neither publicly addressed the end of their romance.
He was jokingly linked to Natalie Portman after the duo were recently seen sharing a cigarette outside of a popular London bar.
Photos of the Star Wars actress, 43, and the All of Us Strangers star hit social media and fans were overwhelmed with excitement as the pair were seen giggling and chatting together outside The Bar With No Name.
Natalie put rumours to rest as she reassured everyone that they are ‘friends’ and nothing more but added: ‘I’m very in awe of his talent.’
In February 2023, Paul spoke to Vanity Fair about his love life being in the spotlight is often incredibly frustrating.
‘Sometimes I can drown it out and then other times it makes me really mad and upset,’ he shared. 
‘People are going to write and say things because there’s a certain interest with any person who’s in the public eye in how that person lives their life, and who they’re living up with, and what they’re doing and how they’re going about doing it.’
Paul added, ‘And look, a lot of the time people are really kind about their support for me. That’s my predominant experience.’
Metro.co.uk has reached out to Paul and Gracie’s reps for comment.
