Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour might be ending later this year, but it’s already become the most successful tour in history, grossing over $1 billion in ticket sales — and, of course, selling out immediately.

	“A lot of you are like, ‘How are you going to celebrate the 100th show?’” Swift recently said at her Liverpool show, later referencing the official end of the Eras Tour later this year. “And for me, the celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December, like that’s it. And that feels like so far away from now, but then again, it feels like we just played our first show on this tour, because you have made this so much fun for us.”

	So far in 2024, the Eras Tour has seen appearances from everyone from Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce during The Tortured Poets Department section of show, to the debut of Swift’s duet with Gracie Abrams of “Us,” from the singer-songwriter’s new album. 



	Swift previously delighted fans when she released her Grammy-winning album Midnights and announced a new tour in 2022. But Swifties weren’t feeling happy right after tickets initially went on sale, as overwhelming demand for Swift tickets caused Ticketmaster to cancel its public on-sale and prices to soar. 

	While Ticketmaster was initially the official selling partner for Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets, thousands of fans were previously left out of luck before the verified presale by Ticketmaster even ended. Fans had to sign up for the presale and be “invited” for a chance to buy tickets. And while the intention was good — no competing with bots for the best seats — few people actually got the chance to place an order.

	And while Swift’s run of U.S. dates initially were scheduled to wrap up in Los Angeles — just as August 2023 started to already slip away — the star announced that the Eras Tour would make a comeback in 2024, with a slew of North American dates scheduled in Miami, New Orleans, and Indianapolis, before heading to Toronto for six dates at the Rogers Centre with Gracie Abrams. 



	“Turns out it’s NOT the end of an era 😝 Miami, New Orleans, Indy and Toronto: The Eras Tour is coming to you in 2024 with @gracieabrams!” Swift shared in a post on social media August 3, 2023. 



	If you didn’t get lucky enough to buy Taylor Swift tickets the first time around, here’s where else you might find sold-out Eras Tour stubs online.

	Your best bet to find Swift tickets online now is likely to go through a reseller if you don’t get them through Ticketmaster‘s Verified Fan registration and Verified Fan Onsale, with many of them offering discounts or promo codes that you can use for Taylor tickets. 

	Our suggestion: Do a little price comparison between the sites to find the cheapest Taylor Swift tickets online, and check back closer to the concert date in case ticket holders are trying to unload their seats — that’s when you’ll likely get the cheapest tickets online.

	Taylor Swift tickets on StubHub currently are on sale for as low as $311 for her Fourth of July show in Amsterdam, and as much as $2,440 for the Miami show on October 18. While there isn’t an active StubHub promo online right now, the site does have one of the best policies in case Swift has to cancel one of her shows. If an event is canceled, the site will give you a StubHub credit for 120% of the amount you paid. 

	Tickets on Vivid Seats currently start around the $2,100 mark for 300-level seats for Swift’s Miami dates, with cheaper tickets available for dates outside of the U.S. (like, $275 USD for Amsterdam dates). Use our exclusive Rolling Stone promo code RS2024 at checkout to save $20 off your $200+ order through the mobile app. Vivid Seats also has a rewards program that lets you buy 10 tickets and get the 11th ticket free.



	You might not be able to find Taylor Swift tickets on Ticketmaster, but we spotted great seats available on TicketNetwork.com. The resale site has seats from $1,129 online for her upcoming Dublin show, which is not cheap but still one of the lowest prices we’re seeing for the Ireland dates. TicketNetwork also works with Affirm, so you can buy your tickets now and pay over time. Want a Taylor Swift discount code? You can use TicketNetwork‘s promo code RS150 saves you $150 off your order of $500, or RS300 for a $300 discount on a $1,000 order.

	We spotted many Taylor Swift tickets on SeatGeek as of this writing, and the site is usually a solid bet for resale tickets to popular concerts and events. Use the SeatGeek promo code ROLLINGSTONE10 to get $10 off your $250+ ticket purchase. It’s not a huge discount but still a chance to get save on Taylor tix. SeatGeek will also often offer other promo codes, if you’re looking for discounted Taylor Swift tickets, so we recommend keeping an eye out on their site.



	Another trustworthy resale site you can look for Eras Tour tickets is Gametime. Of course, Taylor Swift ticket prices can change at any time, but right now, the cheapest tickets for the Miami opener this October Swifties will find on the site start around $2,153 per ticket. Sometimes Gametime will offer a deal or promotion on tickets, so keep an eye out for discounted tickets on the site’s sidebar for flash deals.

	The most affordable tickets we spotted for Swift’s Miami dates on resale site Viagogo start around $2,267 per ticket, which gets you a seat in the 300-level area of the Hard Rock Stadium. We like shopping for tickets on Viagogo because you can see what your view will be before buying the tickets on its site. But as most Swifties have discovered, there’s really no bad seat for the Eras Tour.

	Resale site TicketLiquidator has several available tickets to the upcoming Eras Tour dates. We spotted tickets for the opening night in Miami this October starting at $3,500+ for the 300-level section, and going up to as much as $7,500 for floor seats. 

(Note: All of these promo codes were live and verified at time of this article’s publishing.)

	If you’re stumped on which tickets to get, checking out the stage layout is pretty helpful, and super easy to find while you’re purchasing tickets. While each stage layout may differ slightly depending on the stadium, it looks like all will have a main stage, a walkway leading to a diamond-shaped smaller stage, and finally, a ramp leading to a rectangular mini-stage (see below for an example). Obviously, Eras Tour tickets surrounding the main stage will be the priciest but you might find some decent prices next to the secondary stages.
