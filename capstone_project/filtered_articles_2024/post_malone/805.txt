Post Malone shared a snippet of an unreleased, heartfelt ballad in honor of Father’s Day. The 35-second audio clip shared on TikTok is the latest sneak peek Post Malone has shared as he teases his forthcoming country album.
Posty didn’t confirm the song title or a release date when he shared it on TikTok on Sunday (June 16); however, the sweet song captured the special relationship between fathers and daughters. Post Malone, whose daughter was born in 2022, sings about walking his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day. He includes sentimental lyrics like “she’s my everything,” among others.
Post Malone’s next country collaboration is “Somebody Pour Me a Drink,” with Blake Shelton. The duo performed the soon-to-release anthem during a surprise performance at CMA Fest earlier this month in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee. They’ve since confirmed that it will make its highly-anticipated debut on Friday (June 21). “Somebody Pour Me a Drink” will follow Post Malone’s collaboration with Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help.” CMA Fest, the longest-running country festival in the world, will air in a televised concert special hosted by Jelly Roll and Ashley McBryde on Tuesday, June 25 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT on ABC and streaming the next day on Hulu.
