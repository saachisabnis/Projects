Eight new ACM Awards performers have just been announced, including Post Malone, Blake Shelton and a country-pop collaboration nobody saw coming.
Country music's last two Entertainers of the Year lead the lineup of 2024 ACM Awards performers.
Five of the seven nominees for 2024 ACM Entertainer of the Year are set to take the stage on May 16. Additionally, Jason Aldean, Thomas Rhett, Miranda Lambert and host Reba McEntire will perform.

A full list of performers for the 2024 ACM Awards can be found below. The new additions include Shelton with Gwen Stefani, Kelsea Ballerini, Parker McCollum and "World on Fire" hitmaker Nate Smith with pop-rocker Avril Lavigne.
Of the seven Entertainer of the Year nominees, only Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen are absent from this first list of performers. Both could be added later, as both show an opening on their tour calendars.
Only one of five (Lainey Wilson) Female Artist of the Year nominees is set to perform, and so far, none of the Group or Duo artists are locked in. Typically, the three-hour awards show includes about 20 performers. Often an out-of-genre artist is included, but that wasn't the case in 2023.
Combs has the most nominations for the 2024 ACMs (eight), followed by Megan Moroney and Wallen with six. This post will be updated as more performers are announced.
