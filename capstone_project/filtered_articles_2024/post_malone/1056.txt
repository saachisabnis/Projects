Morgan Wallen didn’t bother releasing the song we all want him to in April (yet), but he is releasing another track Monday from his 2023 album.
We’re all waiting extremely patiently for Post Malone and Morgan Wallen to officially release their song “I Had Some Help.” Wallen teased the track earlier in the year. But after Post shared a longer, produced version on his Instagram in March, the entire country went into a tailspin, waiting with bated breath for the song of the year to actually be released.
Instead of doing what we all want him to, Wallen is instead sending his wonderful track “Cowgirls ft. ERNEST” to country radio, according to Whiskey Riff.
“Cowgirls” is a great track, don’t get me wrong. But all of us know it isn’t as good as whatever Wallen cooked up with Posty in the studio over the winter.
Don’t believe me? Listen to the sample shared by Post Malone below.

See, I told you it is better than “Cowgirls.”
It isn’t really fair to compare the two tracks. “Cowgirls” is a slower, more masculine anthem that’ll get us all slow dancing with our redneck boyfriends (fiancé in my case) throughout summer 2024.

America needs a new anthem right now. Beyonce’s country album just didn’t cut it for macro-audience appeal (sorry, Rob). While her songs are fine, we’re all crying out for a vibe that will get us dancing, singing along, making strangers our best friends as we realize the one thing we all have in common is an addiction to the beat. It’s a song for road trips, late nights with a beer at the beachside bonfire. It’s everything.
I truly believe “I Had Some Help” could be the track of the decade, so Posty needs to hurry the heck up and give us the whole thing!
THE END!#MorganWallen’s “One Night At A Time World Tour” ended yesterday in London and will come back with a new leg in April 2024.

Check out Kay Symthe’s review of Wallen’s recent performance in London:
Hmmm. Call me crazy, but perhaps Wallen has finally broken down the country door to Britain because he’s actually really, really, really good? He’s an incredible songwriter, the likes of which I’ve not heard since the early days of Robbie Williams. And his vocal range is just as superb.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
