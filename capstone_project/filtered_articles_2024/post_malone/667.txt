Bud Light and Post Malone fans could win a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to see him perform his new country album before its release.
Bud Light has launched a sweepstakes for “A Night in Nashville,” which is a
one-night-only event where longtime partner Post Malone will debut songs from the country album, among other classics, for a small audience in Nashville. On July 16, the winning fans will hear the
album before its official release later this summer.
“Bud Light has been so lucky to have a front row seat to (Malone’s) remarkable career over the years and we couldn’t be
more excited to embark on this new era with him,” said Todd Allen, senior vice president of marketing for Bud Light in a release.
The event is being promoted via Bud Light’s social
channels. To enter, fans 21 and over can direct message “A Night In Nashville” to the brand’s Instagram or Facebook pages for information.

The ongoing collaboration between Bud Light and the, Grammy-award-nominated Malone is just one of many music
integrations with the beer. With an emphasis on live performances, Bud Light has produced the Bud Light Backyard Tour and the Bud Light Dive Bar Series, which featured artists such as Lady Gaga, John
Mayer and One Republic. The brand has said it will have a significant presence at 2024’s Stagecoach Festival later this summer and the Country Music Awards Fest, collaborating with additional
music stars.
