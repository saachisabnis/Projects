Today is June 19, also known as Juneteenth, which marks the date when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, in 1865 to emancipate the last enslaved Americans following the Civil War, more than five months after the 13th Amendment was ratified.
Earlier this week, the Rome City Commission presented a proclamation, read by Commissioner Elaina Beeman, recognizing the federal holiday in the City of Rome.
“Juneteenth commutates the freeing of formerly enslaved individuals and their decedents,” the proclamation read. “It has historically been a time of prayer, reflection, and family reunion. Juneteenth also highlights artistic and intellectual achievements collectively preserved by the pre and post-middle passages—the slave trade, the emancipation era, and, the Civil Rights movement as well as more recent accomplishments of African-American cultural expressions. Although Juneteenth is specific to the emancipation of African decedents, its mission promotes the continued freedom and economic prosperity of individuals of all races, colors, creeds, and cultures.”
Sara Malone, president of the Rome-Floyd County NAACP, and other community leaders were on hand at the commission meeting to accept the proclamation.
