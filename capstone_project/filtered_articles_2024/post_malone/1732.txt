Post Malone‘s highly-anticipated upcoming country album, F-1 Trillion, drops on August 16, and the music superstar has just announced the release date for his next collaborative single from that project. Posty’s new song with Luke Combs, “Guy For That,” is finally set for release on Friday, July 26, after weeks of teasing on social media and images being shared of the country stars filming a music video for the track this past week in Nashville. Post Malone shared an Instagram video featuring him and Combs, the two-time CMA entertainer of the year, filming the music video for “Guy For That” in downtown Nashville‘s historic Broadway district, with Posty sporting an awesome “Dolly Parton Fan Club” trucker hat. The caption to the clip simply says, “Guy For That out 7.26 @lukecombs.” (Billboard)
