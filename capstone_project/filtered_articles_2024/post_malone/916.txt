Post Malone paid tribute to legendary country artist George Strait with a rendition of “Carrying Your Love with Me” during a recent show. 
Strait released the classic ballad on his 1997 studio album of the same title. The Texas-born artist launched his career with his debut record in the early 1980s, and has since become known for “Check Yes Or No,” “Write This Down,” “Amarillo By Morning,” “All My Ex’s Live in Texas,” and many other beloved hits over the years. most recently, Strait released his 13-track album, Cowboys And Dreamers, in September.
Post Malone recently performed on his headlining “F-1 Trillion Tour,” following the release of his highly-anticipated country album. The 18-track project — with nine additional tracks on the surprise deluxe edition — features collaborations with some of the genre’s biggest trailblazers and legends. Artists featured on F-1 Trillion include Tim McGraw, Hank Williams Jr., Morgan Wallen, Blake Shelton, Dolly Parton, Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs and many others. Post Malone's cover of Strait's “Carrying Your Love with Me” is one of his latest tribute to one of the genre's most beloved legends, including recent covers of Toby Keith songs. Post Malone honored Keith at the recent Country Music Hall of Fame induction in Nashville, Tennessee. Watch him cover “Carrying Your Love with Me” here:
