Post Malone, the music star with 10 Billboard Music Awards and a whopping nine Grammy Award nods to his name, remains an enigma to some when it comes to the origins of his stage name.
The American artist, whose real name is Austin Richard Post, has left fans scratching their heads over the genesis of 'Post Malone', sparking discussions on platforms such as Reddit, where one user curiously inquired: "Where did it come from?"
Contrary to the prevalent myth that he took inspiration from basketball legend Karl Malone, the rapper clarified the air around his name choice.
Apparently, he embraced 'Post' from his last name and then turned to an online 'rap name generator', striking gold with 'Malone'.
This revelation was shared during his stint on the VH1 show hosted by Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, 'Martha and Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party,' where he divulged that he adopted the pseudonym in his early teens, well before fame's spotlight found him.

Indigo Music encapsulates his journey, stating: "The ambitious rapper adopted his stage moniker at a young age, long before achieving multi-platinum hits and Grammy nominations. During an appearance on Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg's VH1 show, 'Martha and Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party,' he shared that he began calling himself Post Malone around the age of 14.
"In a 2011 interview with Jimmy Fallon, Malone revealed that he used an online rap name generator, inspired by Donald Glover, who also found his stage name using the Wu-Tang generator. He recounted how entering his name into the generator was amusing until he saw "Post Malone" and immediately loved it.

"The pseudonym combines his last name, Post, with the rest generated by the online tool. He's not alone in this method-fellow musician Childish Gambino also derived his name from an online Wu-Tang Clan generator."
As Post is considered to be "kind" and "down-to-earth", many fans believe it's fitting that he'd use an online name generator for such a task. Commenting on this revelation, one Reddit user said: "Post Malone said that he got it from a rapper name generator, so maybe he's trying to cover his WoW [World of Warcraft] addiction up. Another user added: "Is this real?!
A third user said: "Of course he did." One more user added: "I honestly would have thought he just liked Malorne from the Lore. ".
