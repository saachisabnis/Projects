Thanks to the power of the internet, it is almost impossible to keep a secret. Even before the 2024 Paris Olympics kicked off, the internet revealed Celine Dion would perform at the opening ceremony. And now, Post Malone watched as the tracklist for his debut country album, F-1 Trillion, was released. But it had nothing to do with the internet as it appears the leak happened due to Target. While thrilled to sell Malone’s upcoming album, the company unexpectedly released the tracklist that showed just how many country stars would appear on the album. 
For months now, Malone teased fans with his step into country music. With Beyonce dominating the airwaves with her Cowboy Carter album, it seemed like the perfect time to also branch out into a new genre. While Malone promised an album full of country, the lineup revealed the singer will share the mic with stars like Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Brad Paisley, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Hardy, and even Dolly Parton. What is even more shocking is the fact that that is just a few of the names.

With Malone collaborating with Chris Stapleton, the singer’s entrance into country music is sure to be memorable. Fans loved the tracklist revealed, with one person writing, “To quote the man of the hour:  WOW! seriously that’s crazy.   Can’t release fast enough. Also slow clap for country. That’s an amazing welcome. Also DOLLY PARTON!”

A few months ago, the executive producers of the Academy of Country Music Awards sat down to discuss music, awards, and even Malone. Raj Kapoor didn’t share any specifics surrounding the album at the time, but promised, “Get ready for Post. Everybody saw how brilliant he was at Stagecoach, and now we get him for his first television appearance with his country album. He’s been so invested in the community working with so many people there, so many different artists, so many different musicians.”
Thrilled to watch country music expand, Kapoor concluded his praise of Malone, admitting, “The authenticity and the love that Post has for the genre is really unique.” Don’t miss the release of F-1 Trillion. The album is expected to hit shelves on August 16, 2024.
