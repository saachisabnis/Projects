Post Malone has announced the official title of his upcoming country album, which he has been working on for several months.
Posty announced the album's title on his Instagram to his over 25 million followers. He captioned a photo of a billboard containing the album title, "F-1 Trillion August 16th."
Many of Malone's fans reacted to the post, including one who wrote, "Posty is having the best year." Another fan commented, "Trillion-dollar babies!" One more fan said, "Should've been grapevine cowboy."
Details are still out on the official track list of the new album or how many songs it will include, but so far, we know these songs and country superstar collaborations are on the project.
Malone's duet with Morgan Wallen, "I Had Some Help," is in the top five charts this week at number two on the Mediabase Country chart. A month ago, Posty and Morgan released a video of the song together, which takes place in a bar and on the back of a pickup truck.
