Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight (featuring Post Malone)” makes another big gain on the Mediabase pop radio airplay chart, formally securing a Top 10 position.
Played ~9,004 times during the April 28-May 4 tracking period, “Fortnight” rises three places to #10 on this week’s chart. The spin count reflects a week-over-week increase of 2,308, which ranks as the pop format’s greatest airplay gain.
Not simply new to pop radio’s Top 10, “Fortnight” also joins that region of this week’s Mediabase hot adult contemporary radio chart. The “Tortured Poets Department” single ascends four places to #9 on that format’s listing.
Ariana Grande’s “we can’t be friends” also makes Hot AC radio’s Top 10, climbing two spots to #10.
