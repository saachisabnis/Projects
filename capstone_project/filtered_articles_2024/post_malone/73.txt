As you can see, the album is stacked with top-tier talent. We've already heard a few of the songs from the album including "I Had Some Help" w/ Morgan Wallen, "Pour Me a Drink" w/ Blake Shelton, and "Guy For That" w/ Luke Combs. The new album doesn't come out until until Friday, but there has been a ton of hype leading up to the official release date. Some music critics have already said the album can potentially win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
