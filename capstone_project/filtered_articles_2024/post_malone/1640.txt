"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"
 


JULY 18, 2024 - Paramount+ today revealed the full lineup of celebrity voice actors featured in the all-new original 2D animated series TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. All 12 episodes of the premiere season will debut on Friday, August 9, exclusively on Paramount+ in the U.S. and Canada, and on Saturday, August 10, in the U.K. and Australia. Rollout in additional international markets will be announced at a later date.
 
New voice actors featured in TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES include the following guest stars reprising their roles from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem:
 
·	Rose Byrne as Leatherhead: Leatherhead is part of the Mutanimals, a group of allies who join forces with the Turtles. Leatherhead is trying to adjust to her new life away from Superfly, but the giant Australian crocodile is having a tough time. Always ready to throw a shrimp on the barbie and go on a walkabout, Leatherhead loves the Turtles and her fellow Mutanimals but is struggling to truly fit in as both a mutant and an Australian in New York.
 
 
 
·	Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut: The mechanical genius Mutanimal bat, known as Wingnut, finds a kindred spirit in Donatello, and the two talk all day about anime, comics, and their favorite sci-fi reptiles. But she does not love life in the sewers - she's terrified of the dark, claustrophobic and a little paranoid from too much doomscrolling. However, Wingnut will do whatever it takes to help her friends, no matter how much it freaks her out.
 
 
 
·	Post Malone as Ray Fillet: Ray Fillet is a Mutanimal manta ray who loves being a mutant just as much as he loves singing his name. And while the latter may make it hard for anyone to understand what he's trying to say, he always comes in clutch (and in perfect pitch!) when it matters most.

 
 
Additionally, the following guest stars are new to the TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES series:
·	Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Pigeon Pete: Pigeon Pete is a New York City pigeon that got splashed by some bleach, chemicals, a bit of dirt and Mikey's blood! As a brand new Mutanimal, Pete's still getting the hang of things. He's erratic and excitedly flails about, but beneath the coos and poos, there's more than meets the eye. With a little time (and a bit of electricity), Pete will spread his wings and find his voice.
 
 
·	Timothy Olyphant as Goldfin: Goldfin is the leader of the East River Three, a group of evil inhabitants of New York's East River who were minding their own business when a massive sci-fi machine transformed them into mutants. However, unlike the Turtles and the Mutanimals, these aquatic individuals have not had the best interactions with humans and choose to go the more villainous route. Goldfin is a two-foot-tall mutant goldfish who very weirdly dresses like a fisherman. He loves all things shiny, especially gold and money! Don't let his small stature fool you. What he lacks in size, he makes up for in speed, razor- sharp fins and absolute ruthlessness.
 
 
 
·	Jillian Bell as Lee the Eel: Lee the Eel is a member of the East River Three with a mouth full of fangs and is absolutely terrifying to behold. A giant snake-like creature that shocks everything she touches, Lee is also a loyal friend to the other East River Three members and plays her part in electrifying fashion. Despite her monstrous appearance, she's really positive but not very fluent in sarcasm, and she doesn't like being the butt of the joke, especially if the punchline is her name.
 
 
 
·	Danny Trejo as Mustang Sally: Super strong with thick armor, the monstrous Mustang Sally is more than a seahorse with legs. Like the other East River Three members, he really wants to go back home. Sally is more motivated than ever as a soon-to-be parent simply trying to give his hundreds of babies a better life. And nothing - or no one - is going to get in the way of that.
 
 
 
TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES series regulars reprising their roles from the major motion picture Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem that were previously announced include Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael and Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil.

What he lacks in size, he makes up for in speed, razor- sharp fins and absolute ruthlessness.
 
 
 
·	Jillian Bell as Lee the Eel: Lee the Eel is a member of the East River Three with a mouth full of fangs and is absolutely terrifying to behold. A giant snake-like creature that shocks everything she touches, Lee is also a loyal friend to the other East River Three members and plays her part in electrifying fashion. Despite her monstrous appearance, she's really positive but not very fluent in sarcasm, and she doesn't like being the butt of the joke, especially if the punchline is her name.
 
 
 
·	Danny Trejo as Mustang Sally: Super strong with thick armor, the monstrous Mustang Sally is more than a seahorse with legs. Like the other East River Three members, he really wants to go back home. Sally is more motivated than ever as a soon-to-be parent simply trying to give his hundreds of babies a better life. And nothing - or no one - is going to get in the way of that.

JULY 18, 2024 - Paramount+ today revealed the full lineup of celebrity voice actors featured in the all-new original 2D animated series TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. All 12 episodes of the premiere season will debut on Friday, August 9, exclusively on Paramount+ in the U.S. and Canada, and on Saturday, August 10, in the U.K. and Australia. Rollout in additional international markets will be announced at a later date.
 
New voice actors featured in TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES include the following guest stars reprising their roles from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem:
 
·	Rose Byrne as Leatherhead: Leatherhead is part of the Mutanimals, a group of allies who join forces with the Turtles. Leatherhead is trying to adjust to her new life away from Superfly, but the giant Australian crocodile is having a tough time. Always ready to throw a shrimp on the barbie and go on a walkabout, Leatherhead loves the Turtles and her fellow Mutanimals but is struggling to truly fit in as both a mutant and an Australian in New York.
 
 
 
·	Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut: The mechanical genius Mutanimal bat, known as Wingnut, finds a kindred spirit in Donatello, and the two talk all day about anime, comics, and their favorite sci-fi reptiles. But she does not love life in the sewers - she's terrified of the dark, claustrophobic and a little paranoid from too much doomscrolling. However, Wingnut will do whatever it takes to help her friends, no matter how much it freaks her out.
 
 
 
·	Post Malone as Ray Fillet: Ray Fillet is a Mutanimal manta ray who loves being a mutant just as much as he loves singing his name. And while the latter may make it hard for anyone to understand what he's trying to say, he always comes in clutch (and in perfect pitch!) when it matters most.

 
 
Additionally, the following guest stars are new to the TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES series:
·	Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Pigeon Pete: Pigeon Pete is a New York City pigeon that got splashed by some bleach, chemicals, a bit of dirt and Mikey's blood! As a brand new Mutanimal, Pete's still getting the hang of things. He's erratic and excitedly flails about, but beneath the coos and poos, there's more than meets the eye. With a little time (and a bit of electricity), Pete will spread his wings and find his voice.
 
 
·	Timothy Olyphant as Goldfin: Goldfin is the leader of the East River Three, a group of evil inhabitants of New York's East River who were minding their own business when a massive sci-fi machine transformed them into mutants. However, unlike the Turtles and the Mutanimals, these aquatic individuals have not had the best interactions with humans and choose to go the more villainous route. Goldfin is a two-foot-tall mutant goldfish who very weirdly dresses like a fisherman. He loves all things shiny, especially gold and money! Don't let his small stature fool you. What he lacks in size, he makes up for in speed, razor- sharp fins and absolute ruthlessness.

Additionally, the following guest stars are new to the TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES series:
·	Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Pigeon Pete: Pigeon Pete is a New York City pigeon that got splashed by some bleach, chemicals, a bit of dirt and Mikey's blood! As a brand new Mutanimal, Pete's still getting the hang of things. He's erratic and excitedly flails about, but beneath the coos and poos, there's more than meets the eye. With a little time (and a bit of electricity), Pete will spread his wings and find his voice.
 
 
·	Timothy Olyphant as Goldfin: Goldfin is the leader of the East River Three, a group of evil inhabitants of New York's East River who were minding their own business when a massive sci-fi machine transformed them into mutants. However, unlike the Turtles and the Mutanimals, these aquatic individuals have not had the best interactions with humans and choose to go the more villainous route. Goldfin is a two-foot-tall mutant goldfish who very weirdly dresses like a fisherman. He loves all things shiny, especially gold and money! Don't let his small stature fool you. What he lacks in size, he makes up for in speed, razor- sharp fins and absolute ruthlessness.
 
 
 
·	Jillian Bell as Lee the Eel: Lee the Eel is a member of the East River Three with a mouth full of fangs and is absolutely terrifying to behold. A giant snake-like creature that shocks everything she touches, Lee is also a loyal friend to the other East River Three members and plays her part in electrifying fashion. Despite her monstrous appearance, she's really positive but not very fluent in sarcasm, and she doesn't like being the butt of the joke, especially if the punchline is her name.
 
 
 
·	Danny Trejo as Mustang Sally: Super strong with thick armor, the monstrous Mustang Sally is more than a seahorse with legs. Like the other East River Three members, he really wants to go back home. Sally is more motivated than ever as a soon-to-be parent simply trying to give his hundreds of babies a better life. And nothing - or no one - is going to get in the way of that.
 
 
 
TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES series regulars reprising their roles from the major motion picture Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem that were previously announced include Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael and Ayo Edebiri as April O'Neil. New to the series are previously announced guest stars Pete Davidson as the voice of Rod and Alanna Ubach as Bishop.
 
          
 
       
 
From the studios of the Mutant Mayhem film, the all-new Paramount+ original series TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES explores the adventures of everyone's favorite pizza-loving heroes as they emerge from the sewers onto the streets of NYC. Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey are faced with new threats and team up with old allies to survive both teenage life and villains lurking in the shadows of the Big Apple. The series is produced by Nickelodeon Animation and Point Grey Pictures.
