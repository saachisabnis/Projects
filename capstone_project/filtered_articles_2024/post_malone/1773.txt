Post Malone is creating a new IP universe with Vault Comics and Michael Bay and Brad Fuller’s Platinum Dunes.
According to reports, the universe will be based on an original story from Posty himself. Set in medieval Europe, fans can expect aspects inspired by the likes of Mad Max: Fury Road and Evil Dead. “…the only thing standing in the way of the horde of demons infesting the continent is a mysterious armored 18-wheeler seemingly sent back from the heavens,” Variety wrote. The IP will first be launched as a graphic novel in 2025 and will be followed by a feature film.
“I’m so pumped to share this badass story with the world, and I couldn’t ask for better partners than Michael Bay and Vault to help bring this story to life,” Malone said in a statement. “This is the kind of project you dream about,” added Vault CEO Damian Wassel. “We get to work with an exceptional artist at the top of his game to build a completely original story from the ground up. We have an iconic director helping to guide the creative development. We’re going to bring the world a mind-blowing graphic novel, and that’s just the beginning.”
“I love working with talented people, and Post Malone is incredibly gifted,” Bay shared. “I am excited to work with him on such an intriguing idea, and when you add Vault to the mix, it raises the bar to another level. This new IP is just what the graphic world needs right now.”
