Gogglebox favourites Dave and Shirley Griffiths have been wished well as they ditched the UK after filming the show's final episode.
The Caerphilly couple, who joined the Channel 4 show in 2015, have jetted off to Dubai as this series winds to a close. As the two prepared to begin their international journey, Dave filmed a video for their many fans.
As he faced the camera, Dave said: "Hi everybody, we're live at Birmingham Airport waiting to go to Dubai, so happy days huh? Don't you all forget tonight, Channel 4, Gogglebox best special show tonight.

"And at the same time do a little voting for us on the NTAs, come on if you would people, thanks a lot. Have a great time and have a great summer, thanks a lot all."
The video comes after Dave and Shirley confirmed in a previous update, last week, that they wouldn't be filming again until September - when the new Gogglebox series will begin.
Fans have rushed to the comments section of the latest post to wish the couple well, as Bea said: "Have a wonderful holiday and summer". Susan said: "You 2 are my favourites. I'm really going to miss you both as I hear that you will not be returning in September [crying emoji".
Nicola said: "Have a great holiday in Dubai Dave n Shirley, enjoy the rest" [sic]
