Pharrell is making a movie about his life — with LEGOs.
The omnipresent visionary took to social media on Friday morning to reveal the official poster for Piece by Piece, a nontraditional biopic that will chronicle his evolution in LEGO form. “Who would’ve thought that playing with LEGOs as a kid would evolve into a movie about my life,” he captioned the image, in which his fully-formed LEGO character wears the Minecraft-like suit that appeared on his debut Louis Vuitton runway. “It’s proof that anyone else can do it too.”

Focus Features, the production company behind the film, offered a little more insight on what exactly can be expected from the project: “Uninterested in making a traditional film about his life, Pharrell set out to tell his story in a way that would set audience’s imaginations free. Developed from his singular vision, Piece by Piece defies genres and expectations to transport audiences into a LEGO world where anything is possible. ”
Director Morgan Neville added, “Five years ago, Pharrell Williams approached me with the idea of helping him tell his story through LEGO animation. It was one of those rare moments where I knew in a second that this was a journey I wanted to go on.”
Neville is also producing the film, alongside Caitrin Rogers, Mimi Valdés, Sani Saxon, Jill Wilfert, Keith Malone and Pharrell. “When I had this crazy vision to tell this story through LEGO bricks, I couldn’t have imagined a better partner than Morgan,” said Pharrell. “He is a legend.”
Piece by Piece will release in theaters on October 11, 2024. Further details on the movie’s plot and cast are not yet available. Stay tuned to Hypebeast for more information on the title as it becomes available.
