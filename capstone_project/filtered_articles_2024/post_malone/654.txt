The revelation that DNA contamination can lead to birth defects or cancer surfaced when Dr. Robert Malone, the biochemist who helped invent the mRNA vaccine, made an appearance at House of Representatives hearing led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna has a patent that acknowledges RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines due to risks of insertional mutagenesis, which might activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes. "Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines," Malone stated. "And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes because problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes." "FDA [Food and Drug Administration] says they're not aware of any concerns, but Moderna, in its patent, lays out the same concerns about DNA in insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity," Malone continued. He added that Moderna knew DNA was a contaminant but was left in because of how they make it. "They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA and then they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA and the process they are using is not that good," he said. Another Big Pharma company also eventually acknowledged that its jabs, which were meant to "cure" COVID-19, are also contaminated with cancer-causing DNA fragments. In the documentation to regulatory bodies, Pfizer omitted information about the presence of Simian Virus 40 sequences in its vaccine. The documentation suggests that there are certain DNA sequences present in the vials that are normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans, "not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene," Malone explained. “They include these sequences from SV 40 – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences – which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis.” He added that the FDA did not take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps and look at them themselves. Instead, they took for granted what Pfizer had given them. “And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found,” he further said. Malone warned that the potential consequences for jab recipients are "anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones."

In the documentation to regulatory bodies, Pfizer omitted information about the presence of Simian Virus 40 sequences in its vaccine. The documentation suggests that there are certain DNA sequences present in the vials that are normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans, "not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene," Malone explained. “They include these sequences from SV 40 – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences – which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis.” He added that the FDA did not take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps and look at them themselves.
