Michael Cole announced a handful of names that will be available as downloadable content for WWE 2K24 during the Feb. 26 episode of Raw. But after a little confusion about who will be on the main game roster when WWE and 2K’s latest collaboration is released next week (Mar. 5 for the deluxe edition, Mar. 8 for the standard one), we waited until getting an official press release to share who you’ll be able to purchase in individual packs or as part of a Season Pass — and when you’ll be able to get your hands on them.
Here’s that press release:
WWE® 2K24 DLC to Include CM Punk, Pat McAfee, Post Malone, Jade Cargill, Iron Sheik and More
