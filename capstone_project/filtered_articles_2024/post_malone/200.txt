Mike D is a HUGE Post Malone fan, and he finally got to meet him at Bobby Bones & The Raging Idiots  7th Million Dollar Show benefiting St. Jude that happened last night (April 3rd).  
He was anticipating meeting him the whole night. When he first saw Post Malone walk in, he said it felt like his whole body left him. He immediately went backstage to rehearse so Mike knew it wasn’t the right time to introduce himself. When Post Malone went on stage, his security came out and cleared the area so he was worried they were going to have him move and he wouldn’t get to meet him, but he stood his ground and stayed side stage. After the show when he came backstage, he got to meet him, shake his hand, take a picture together and tell him he is a huge fan! Mike also got to keep the Bud Light can Post Malone was drinking out of and now has it at his house!
