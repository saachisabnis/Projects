 It's pretty common knowledge that Post Malone is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. But maybe the feeling is mutual?
Because recently star quarterback Dak Prescott decided to sneak in Post Malone song titles from "F-1 Trillion" into his press conference. So, it seems like the Cowboys are big Posty fans, too. Or at least Dak is.
After he was done and walking off stage, Dak turned and asked how many song titles he got in, and they said, "Eight". Dak was proud of himself, and gave a little fist pump.
