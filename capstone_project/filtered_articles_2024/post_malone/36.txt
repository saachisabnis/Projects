The Chicago Bulls will hire Wes Unseld Jr. to become the top assistant on Billy Donovan's staff, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Unseld, who began the season as the head coach of the Washington Wizards, was fired in January and moved into a front office role with the franchise. The Wizards didn't want to burn bridges with Unseld, considering his father's prominent history with the organization as a player and front office executive.
But Unseld's post-playing career has been in coaching, where he served as an assistant on several coaching staffs, including on Michael Malone's bench in Denver prior to becoming head coach of the Wizards.
Now, after three years in Washington, which included 2.5 seasons as a head coach, Unseld now returns to the bench as an assistant in Chicago to help bolster Donovan's coaching staff.
