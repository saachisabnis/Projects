A handful of familiar faces help make the Top 5 of October's Top 40 Country Songs, but one famous face is missing.
Post Malone has two songs inside this month's Top 10, but neither could best Ella Langley and Riley Green, who hold down the No. 5 spot with "You Look Like You Love Me."
Morgan Wallen is also absent from the top of this list, but both men are well-represented overall. Jelly Roll, Shaboozey and Luke Combs are a few more stars with hot songs right now, but by Oct. 31, another artist may soar to No. 1.
MGK (with Jelly Roll) has been taking "Lonely Road" to every big stage he can find. Could it become a country radio single soon?

As always, the October 2024 list of the Top 40 country songs is equal parts airplay, sales and streaming charts, plus fan ratings. Staff opinion breaks any ties.
1. Shaboozey, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — Could this be the greatest debut country song ever? — LAST MONTH'S NO. 1! NO. 1 SALES AND STREAMING! 
2. Jelly Roll, “I Am Not Okay” (+6) — With his new Beautifully Broken album coming Oct. 11, expect to see a lot of Jelly Roll this month.
3. Luke Combs, “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma” (-1) — Luke Combs' most rocking hit to date had no trouble getting to No. 1 on airplay charts.
4. Marshmallow & Kane Brown, “Miles on It” (+2) — It took awhile, but fans are starting to recognize "Miles on It" as a real earworm.
5. Ella Langley (Feat. Riley Green), “You Look Like You Love Me” (+2) — This might be the best duet of 2024, save one or two from Post Malone.
