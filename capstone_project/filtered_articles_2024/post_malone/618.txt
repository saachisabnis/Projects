During a recent episode of Nova 96.9’s Fitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie in Sydney, Australia, Keith Urban was busy praising Miley Cyrus when he paid the Grammy-winning singer a strange compliment. Urban had just performed a cover of Cyrus’ hit song, “Flowers,” on the show, and the 56-year-old country superstar then gushed about how he has “always loved Miley,” before going on to say this about her. “I love that voice, man, that voice. She sounds like an ashtray. And I mean that as a compliment. She sounds like the carpet at the RSL!” Later in the interview, Urban discussed the authenticity of some new country artists currently flourishing in Nashville. “It’s a funny thing because you still need the support of the system in Nashville,” Urban said. “And if you go about it the right way, like Post [Malone] did, you’ll see the love.” (People)
