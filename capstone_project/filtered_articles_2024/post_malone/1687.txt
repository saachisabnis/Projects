Post Malone is taking a bold step into the world of country music with the release of his latest album, F-1 Trillion. The 29-year-old artist, known for his eclectic style and genre-blending sound, dropped his sixth studio album on Friday (August 16), surprising fans and critics alike with a collection of tracks that showcase his versatility and deep appreciation for country music.
The album features an impressive lineup of collaborations with some of country music’s biggest names, including Tim McGraw, Morgan Wallen, Dolly Parton, Jelly Roll, and many others. This star-studded roster not only highlights Post Malone’s connections in the music industry but also his respect for the genre and its traditions.
In a recent interview with Apple Music, Post Malone opened up about his long-standing desire to create a country album and the challenges he faced in making it a reality. “I gotta keep writing in Nashville. I’ve always wanted to make a record like this, but for the longest time, it [seemed] so inaccessible because I [didn’t] know how the hell it [worked],” Post shared candidly.
He went on to explain the initial hurdles he encountered while navigating the country music scene. “I didn’t know how band day worked. I didn’t know how session dudes worked, and I was just like,’Well, is it like these particular artists’ band that they go with all the time?’” Post Malone admitted, reflecting on the steep learning curve he faced.
However, his journey into country music became more tangible once he started collaborating with some of Nashville’s finest musicians. “But going in there and meeting Derek [Wells] and Larry Franklin and Paul Franklin and Craig [Young] and Dave Cohen and Aaron [Sterling], and it was just so cool. And I’m just mind blown,” he said, expressing his amazement at the talent and professionalism he encountered in the studio.
The release of F-1 Trillion marks a significant moment in Post Malone’s career as he explores a new musical landscape. His willingness to experiment with different sounds and genres has always been a hallmark of his artistry, and this album is no exception. By blending his unique style with the storytelling and instrumental elements of country music, Post Malone has created a fresh and compelling body of work that is likely to resonate with both his existing fan base and new listeners.
The album is now available for download on iTunes and can be streamed on Spotify, giving fans the opportunity to experience Post Malone’s country music debut in full. With its blend of heartfelt lyrics, catchy melodies, and impressive collaborations, F-1 Trillion is set to make waves in the music industry and further cement Post Malone’s status as one of today’s most innovative and versatile artists.
