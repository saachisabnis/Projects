	“This is my 13th Grammy,” Swift said when accepting the award, acknowledging her proclaimed lucky number. “I want to say thank you to the members of the Recording Academy for voting this way, but I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say ‘thank you’ to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years — which is that my brand new album comes out April 19.”

	










Midnights went on to also win best album later that evening, making Swift the first ever person to win the award four times.
