	Post Malone adds his second Country Airplay top 10, after “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, led for four weeks beginning in June. Both singles are from his first country LP, F-1 Trillion, which soared in at No. 1 on the Aug. 31-dated Top Country Albums chart and the all-genre Billboard 200 with 250,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States. It scored the second-biggest week for a country title this year, after Beyoncé’s maiden release in the genre, Cowboy Carter, arrived with 407,000 in April.

	Post Malone boasts two concurrent Country Airplay top 10s, as “I Had Some Help” holds at No. 2 (28.1 million in audience). Plus, newest F-1 Trillion single “Guy for That,” featuring Luke Combs, ranks at No. 41 (2.6 million).

Shaboozey rules Country Airplay for a sixth total and consecutive week with “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” The track, which drew 28.8 in reach among chart reporters (down 3%), is only the second country career-establishing No. 1 to reign for as many as six weeks (counting acts’ first Country Airplay entries as a lead artist or their initial songs promoted to country radio); Carrie Underwood’s “Jesus, Take the Wheel” logged six weeks on top in early 2006.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” added a seventh week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 31, claiming outright 2024’s longest reign, surpassing the six nonconsecutive weeks on top for Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help.” Shaboozey’s hit has likewise logged the sole longest command this year on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart, its 11 weeks at No. 1 having bested Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em,” which ruled for 10 weeks in February-April.
