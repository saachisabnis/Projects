	In Jennifer Lopez’s new documentary The Greatest Love Story Never Told, producers revealed that Lizzo and a litany of other celebrities turned down cameos in the “I’m Real” singer’s This Is Me … Now: A Love Story film, but according to the Yitty founder, she never received an invite. 

	A very confused Lizzo reacted to a clip from the behind-the-scenes project – in which Lopez’s team says the singer is “unavailable” to participate in the film – in a Wednesday (Feb. 28) TikTok, telling followers, “Ain’t nobody told me nothing.” 

	










	“Nobody asked me,” the “Truth Hurts” artist adds, laughing. “J. Lo, I love you.” 

Billboard has reached out to Lopez’s rep for comment. 

	Lizzo’s reaction comes about two weeks after the 54-year-old singer-actress unveiled This Is Me … Now: A Love Story alongside her new album This Is Me … Now Feb. 16. The accompanying documentary of the album and film’s making, The Greatest Love Story Never Told, arrived Tuesday (Feb. 27) on Prime Video. 

	In addition to Lizzo, producers noted in the doc that Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge and Snoop Dogg were also all unavailable to appear in This Is Me … Now: A Love Story. The film did, however, nab cameos from Fat Joe, Post Malone, Keke Palmer, Trevor Noah, Kim Petras, Jane Fonda, Post Malone, Sofia Vergara, Jenifer Lewis, Jay Shetty, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Derek Hough, Paul Raci, Trevor Jackson and, of course, Lopez’s husband and the muse behind her new record, Ben Affleck. 

This Is Me … Now debuted at No. 38 on the Billboard 200. It serves as a follow-up to the Marry Me star’s 2002 LP This Is Me … Then and captures Lopez’s journey to rekindling her romance with Affleck nearly two decades after they called off their original engagement in 2004. 

	“This Is Me…Then was something that I wrote at that point in time that wound up capturing a moment where I fell deeply in love for the first time in that way, and I didn’t know that I would look back and I think,” she told Billboard earlier this month. “Then to have this kind of crazy, strange, magical, surrealistic plot twist where I wound up back with that person, it was insane and it was also very inspiring.”
