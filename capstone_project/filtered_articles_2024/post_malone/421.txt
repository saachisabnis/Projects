Post Malone and director Michael Bay are collaborating on an unconventional project set in medieval Europe “where the only thing standing in the way of the horde of demons infesting the continent is a mysterious armored 18-wheeler seemingly sent back from the heavens.” Influenced by Mad Max and Evil Dead, the idea will initially be released as a graphic novel in 2025 through Vault Comics, with plans for a movie adaptation later. Post Malone expressed his enthusiasm for the endeavor, stating, “I’m so pumped to share this badass story with the world, and I couldn’t ask for better partners than Michael Bay and Vault to help bring this story to life.”
