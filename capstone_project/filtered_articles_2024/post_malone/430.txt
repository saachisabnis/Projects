Nashville has embraced Post Malone with open arms. After struggling to find his place in the pop and hip-hop spheres, it seems the “Rockstar” singer has finally found his people. His country music debut, F-1 Trillion, achieved certified gold status even before it officially dropped last Friday (Aug. 16.) Before the official album announcement, the GRAMMY-nominated singer-songwriter greased the wheels by sharing his covers of songs by Brad Paisley, Hank Williams, Jr., and George Strait. This past weekend, Malone added another country legend named “George” to his repertoire.
Unsurprisingly, Post Malone spent the past weekend partying in Nashville in celebration of his country music debut. What was surprising, however, was his appearance Sunday (Aug. 18) at Robert’s Western World on Broadway Street.

If Malone’s place in Nashville wasn’t previously solidified, it certainly is now. The shape-shifting hitmaker (born Austin Richard Post) belted out George Jones’ “One Woman Man.”

George Jones is one of the patron saints of 20th-century Nashville, and Malone put some respect on his name. Rockabilly legend Johnny Horton first released “(I’m a) One Woman Man” in 1956. Although Jones recorded his own version four years later, he didn’t release it as a single until 1988. “One Woman Man” was Possum’s final Top 10 hit of his career.
“OhmyGosh… George would be so proud of you @Post Malone!” exclaimed one TikTok user.
“My got he hit that!!!” added another.
Seems like the Broadway crowd should get used to more impromptu Post Malone performances.
Much like Post Malone, Taylor Swift is a master of musical disguise. Before she was arguably the biggest pop star in the world, Swift was releasing twangy hits named after ’90s country stars.
Earlier this year, the pair joined forces on “Fortnight,” the lead single from Swift’s latest album The Tortured Poets Department. And the “Anti-Hero” singer took to social media Saturday (Aug. 17) to give her friend and collaborator his flowers.
“Was lucky enough to hear this amazing music on the set of the ‘Fortnight’ video when Austin played it for me,” Swift wrote on her Instagram stories. ““It’s incredible how versatile his artistry is. And [he’s] just the most down to earth guy alive.”
