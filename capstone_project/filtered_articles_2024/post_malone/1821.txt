Post Malone’s latest collaboration on his highly-anticipated country album is set to officially release on Friday (July 26), but iHeartCountry listeners might be able to catch the Luke Combs duet one day early.
Post Malone’s “Guy For That,” featuring Combs, is playing exclusively on radio for 24 hours before its official debut on Friday. It’s the latest collaboration Posty has released from his 18-track country album, F-1 Trillion, due next month. The genre-blending duo recently took over Lower Broadway, home of the famous stretch of honky tonks in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to film a music video for “Guy For That.”
Earlier this month, Post Malone and Combs hinted that they actually recorded two collaborations together for F-1 Trillion. Combs shared a sneak peek of “Guy For That” on Instagram, and wrote in his caption, “We doin’ this or what, [Post Malone]?” Mason wrote back in the comments: “Okay, FINE 😤 but you like this more than the other one?!?! 😈”
“Guy For That” is the latest track to release as fans eagerly await Post Malone’s F-1 Trillion project. The song follows “I Had Some Help” with Morgan Wallen and “Pour Me A Drink” with Blake Shelton. Malone has shared other teasers over the course of recent months, including including a heartfelt father-daughter ballad and hinting that he also teamed up with award-winning singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton. F-1 Trillion is set to drop on August 16, and Post Malone kicks off his tour the following month.
