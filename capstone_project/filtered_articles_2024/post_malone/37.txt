The BTSC series identifying the all-time Steelers great team has been fun.  Good discussions and the polls brought back some good memories of the black and gold.  Still, there were a number of players that weren’t mentioned that I thought should have been given some love.  These are not my picks to win.  Just guys I thought could/should have been on the ballot.
We quite naturally remember the glory years, but even bad Steelers teams had a few good players.  You’ll see a number of them here.  There are also a few names from a long time ago and some guys I gave extra love because of things they did off the field.  Feel free to agree or disagree with any of the selections.
Warning, this post is long, even after being split into offense and defense.  I like digging into the history of the team.  I picked one player for each position, but included "honorable mentions" in several places.
This post covers the offense.  My picks for defense and kicker are here:  https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2024/7/24/24205351/snubs-left-outs-and-almost-good-enoughs-players-that-could-have-been
QB:  He who must not be named
Oy.  Tough one to start with.  This one was physically painful.
He is most remembered for two horrific interceptions against the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX.  But fact is, the nameless one gave the Steelers five years of quality QB play after the post-Bradshaw ugliness of guys like Mark Malone and David Woodley.  Ironically, he was known for superior ball control and lack of interceptions, throwing the fewest per attempt in the NFL twice in his career.  Until his two in the Super Bowl, Steelers Nation was behind him.
The Steelers made the playoffs all four years the man without a name was the starting QB, including two trips to the AFCCG and one to the SB.  He was rewarded by the Jets with one of the largest free-agent deals in the NFL at that time.
Luckily, the only real argument here was between Ben and Bradshaw.  So it doesn't really matter.  Maybe if we had drafted Dan Marino like we should have....
Honorable Mention:  Bobby Layne
He had lost a step or two, but he played the last four years of a Hall of Fame career in Pittsburgh and is recognized in the team’s Hall of Honor.
RB:  Frank Pollard
Those of us with a little more grey hair remember the 1980’s teams.  They were….uninspiring.  And while the team used first round picks on guys like Greg Hawthorne and Walter "out of bounds" Abercrombie, Frank Pollard was solid as a rock.  He was Merrill Hoge before Merril Hoge, and just as deserving of a spot on this list.  He watched supposedly more talented players disappoint while quietly doing his job and making it work.  Although he never quite made it to 1,000 yards in a season (his best was 991), he is still 6th in team history in rushing yards.  Quite an accomplishment for a guy who was never seen as a star.
Honorable mention: Barry Foster
In 1992 Foster gave us arguably the best single season of any RB in Steelers history, leading the AFC with 1,690 yards and earning a slew of post-season awards and recognition.
FB:  Rocky Bleier
There was some discussion about what was a running back and what was a fullback.  In the 1970’s, Franco Harris was listed as a Fullback and Rocky as a Halfback or running back.  Back then, position names were a different than today because they were based on where the player lined up, not what they did.  Bleier was included on the RB list where he was overshadowed by Franco and the Bus.  That’s a shame.
In today’s game, Rocky would be a fullback and a good one.  Severely wounded in Vietnam, Bleier fought back to have a great NFL career, including a 1000-yard season, a memorable TD catch in Super Bowl XIII, and four championship rings.  IMHO, the conversation for this spot starts and ends with Rocky Bleier.
WR:  Yancey Thigpen
The drop off after the big names is pretty big, but I’ll give Yancey a mention.  He became a favorite target of the nameless one, and had 1307 yards and 85 catches on the way to a Super Bowl berth in 1995.  Injuries hampered his 1996 season, but he came back with 79 catches for 1398 yards in 1997, leading to his second pro-bowl nod.  Only two players in Steelers history have had more receiving yards in a single season than Thigpen’s 1398 (AB and Juju).  That gets him a spot on my ballot.
TE:  Elbie Nickel
Having played in the late 40’s and 50’s, Nickel is a name many fans may not recognize.  But they should.
He got a late start in the NFL due to his service in WWII, but still played for Pittsburgh for 11 years, with three pro-bowl nods.  He piled up over 5,000 receiving yards at a time when teams didn’t throw much.  That’s good for 7th on the all-time Steelers list, 2nd to Heath among TE’s, and a place in the team’s Hall of Honor.
Center:  Ray Mansfield
This one is easy.
Before there was Mike Webster, there was Ray "Ranger" Mansfield.  A converted DL acquired from Philly, he became a mainstay on the offensive line.  He was the starting center for 11 years, including the first two 1970’s Super Bowl teams.  One of a handful of players to survive Chuck Noll’s famous locker room purge, he still holds the team record for most consecutive games played with 182.  Mansfield was as solid as they come and deserves a mention on the all-time Steelers list.
Honorable mention:  Jeff Hartings
He wasn’t here long, but he made two pro-bowls, was named a first team all-pro, and brought home a Super Bowl ring.
OG: Terry Long
Another player from those blah 1980’s teams.  Like two others on this list, his NFL tenure was delayed by military service.  He enlisted and joined the 82nd airborne right after high school, so he didn’t get to the NFL until he was 25.  But he held down the RG spot for eight seasons, sticking around through all of the lousy years.
Honorable Mention: John Nisby
Another player more known for what he did off the field, Nisby was a trailblazer for racial equality in and out of the NFL.
OT:  Alejandro Villanueva
Teams need guys like AV (I’ll resist the urge to call him "Big Al").  A converted WR/TE/DL, he struggled to find his place in the NFL.  I remember watching his first training camp with the Steelers.  His footwork and technique were pretty lousy.  But Mike Munchak took him under his wing and personally coached him up.  He put in the work and gave the Steeler six strong years at left tackle, including 2 Pro-Bowl campaigns.
Amazingly, he did all of that in his late 20’s and 30’s.  His NFL career was delayed because he fulfilled his commitment to the Army after being educated at West Point.  He also earned an MBA from Carnegie Mellon, which is no small task.
He understands adversity.  He understands work ethic.  He understands brotherhood.  And he was a solid player for some fun Steelers teams.  For all those reasons, he makes my list.
