 Coming off a Summer for the City season that welcomed hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts revealed upcoming presentations throughout the Fall and Winter.
Artists from around the world offer performances in contemporary and classical traditions that speak to the cultural diversity of New York City. The sweep of Free or Choose-What-You-Pay events begin September 7. 
Each season, Lincoln Center honors one extraordinary artist whose impact, vision, and values embrace the transformative power of the arts across many of the disciplines represented on campus. Beginning October 2024, we celebrate the living legend, Rubén Blades, one of the most distinguished musicians of our time. 
A prolific composer, recording artist, actor, and former Minister of Tourism and presidential candidate in his native Panama, the 23-time GRAMMY and Latin GRAMMY Award winner and Latin GRAMMY Hall Of Fame inductee revolutionized Latin music by making it a vehicle for stories that center social justice and the lived experiences of people across Latin America. His musical innovations are celebrated worldwide, expanding the definitions of what Afro-Cuban music can be. Recognized for his work across genres, Blades has appeared in over 50 films and garnered three Emmy nominations and an ACE AWARD as best actor in a movie or mini-series.
Lincoln Center’s season-long celebration features an exploration of Blades’ Brazilian music influences in a performance with Brazil’s Boca Livre and the Editus Ensemble with Jazz at Lincoln Center; the U.S. premiere of his large-scale musical work Maestra Vida, a soaring, genre-defying urban drama centered on the Latin American lived experience, performed with the New York Philharmonic; a display at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts tracing his artistic journey entitled From Panama to New York: The Musical Journey of Rubén Blades; and screenings of his 1985 breakout film performance Crossover Dreams with Film at Lincoln Center and his 2018 documentary My Name Is Not Rubén Blades. 
This fall, LCPA welcomes six artists working at the vanguard of their fields to the Collider at Lincoln Center. Each season, fellows will take part in an eight-month residency exploring how the arts intersect with different elements in our society that affect daily lives and well-being. This season’s explorations are centered on the arts and technology. 
Each artist receives studio space, both at Lincoln Center and at Collider collaborator Onassis ONX, a global Onassis Culture platform dedicated to the development of new media art and immersive experiences; financial stipends; artistic and administrative support; and regular opportunities to collaborate with one another and engage with the public. Experimentations, innovations, and learnings from the Collider will be shared throughout the arts industry, helping drive the field forward worldwide. This season’s fellows are director and transdisciplinary artist Celine Daemen; improvisor and composer Kengchakaj Kengkarnka; performer, composer and multi-instrumentalist Angélica Negrón; creative director and choreographer Brandon Powers; multidisciplinary creator and director Annie Saunders; and theater, dance, and installation artist Andrew Schneider.
“We believe artists can help guide us to deeper understanding and appreciation for the multitudes of experiences around us, and that they are uniquely positioned to help us imagine and realize a more humane and equitable future for all,” said Shanta Thake, Ehrenkranz Chief Artistic Officer of LCPA. “We are honored to offer stages for artists from all walks of life this season, alongside continued collaborations with our Artists-in-Residence and welcoming this season’s Collider fellows.”
Across the Fall/Winter, audiences can enjoy returning series and favorites — including Voices of a People’s History; ¡VAYA!; Seen, Sound, Scribe led by Poet-in-Residence Mahogany L. Browne; Festival of Firsts in its third edition; Futuros x New Latin Wave; Under the Radar; globalFEST; a Hip Hop series curated by Xavier “X” Jernigan; and new essays and events as part of the Legacies of San Juan Hill project; alongside family programming for all ages; Lincoln Center Moments and Passport offerings; relaxed performances across campus; ASL-interpreted and captioned events across genres; and a number of exciting premieres. 
Details are below and at lincolncenter.org/presents. Additional commissions and programs will be announced in the coming months. 
Tickets for Choose-What-You-Pay performances go on sale Sept 10; member pre-sale begins Sept 5.

Frente Cumbiero
David Rubenstein Atrium
The ongoing evolution of cumbia, the borderless and tremendously popular Afro-Latin, Indigenous, and European-influenced dance music, finds its contemporary culmination in the modern Nueva Cumbia movement. Nueva Cumbia draws equal inspiration from Jamaican reggae, experimental rock, Latin Hip-Hop, Brazilian tropicália, fusion jazz and the century-long history of cumbia's wildly fertile recorded past. One of the foremost innovators of this movement is the Colombian composer and musician Mario Galeano Toro, leader of the internationally acclaimed Frente Cumbiero quartet. The collective's collaborations with artists as diverse as the dub DJ Mad Professor, the classical combo Kronos Quartet, Japanese folk band Minyo Crusaders and electronic producer Quantic give a sense of Frente Cumbiero's varied creative tactics. Get a taste of the group's retro-psychedelic and highly danceable tropical style at a Lincoln Center debut driven by crazy keys, uplifting horns, and energetic percussion.
Juan Fernando Velasco
David Rubenstein AtriumHaving significantly shaped the political and musical landscape of his native country, Juan Fernando Velasco stands as a preeminent figure in Ecuadorian pop music. A two-time Latin GRAMMY Award nominee and holder of dozens of gold and platinum records, the Miami-based Velasco has established himself both domestically and internationally as the foremost exponent of his craft. Over the past quarter-century, Velasco's hits such as "Déjame," "Chao Lola," and “En Alma en los Labios" with Fonseca, have soundtracked the experience of multiple generations. Juan Fernando Velasco recently released “Esta Vez No Fallaré,” the latest single from his soon-to-be-named 2024 album. As part of his tour commemorating his 25-year solo career, Velasco's intimate Atrium performance promises to be an unforgettable evening, blending traditional pop with the rich melodies of Ecuadorian pasillos, classical guitars and requinto, all infused with the heartfelt essence of Andean folk.

Our History, Our Future: Celebrating 10 Years of Voices at Lincoln Center
Voices of a People’s History
David Rubenstein Atrium
The works of Brooklyn-born author and historian Howard Zinn (1922–2010), particularly the classic bestsellers A People's History of the United States and Voices of a People’s History of the United States, continue to shine a light on the extraordinary history of those engaged in struggles for freedom and justice in America. Since 2014, Lincoln Center has collaborated with Voices of a People's History, a non-profit organization of artists and educators who seek to keep Zinn's message of grassroots egalitarianism alive. This special tenth anniversary event at the David Rubenstein Atrium presents a vital reimagining of Zinn's subjects through a musical and spoken word celebration of dissent, change, and civic growth.

Truth Future Bachman’s SECOND SIGHT, World Premiere
David Rubenstein Atrium
Brooklyn-based composer, playwright, and vocalist Truth Future Bachman deftly interweaves three of the most compelling cultural threads of our moment: musical theater, gender fluidity, and superhero/sci-fi parables. The third act in a series of queer and trans superhero musicals called Shapeshifters (following Luna & the Starbodies and Skyward: An Endling Elegy), SECOND SIGHT is a prophecy of love that persists, resists, and survives the end of the world. Xander is a doctor facing an impossible choice. To escape the iron fist of the 'Dissociate or Die' policy, he flees to the outskirts of society, where musicians, poets, and baristas create an unlikely coalition. Here, bodies intertwine and erotic acts of rebellion erupt in defiance. At the heart of it all is Sike, an oracle whose visions conjure unseen futures. But when Sike's dreams awaken Xander's dormant healing powers, the two find their revolution—and their desires—at the center of a war zone.

Rare Form: Live at Lincoln Center
David Rubenstein Atrium
Prince Terrence first made his name touring and recording in the Midwest hardcore scene, then came up as a drummer for electronic artists like Santigold, Heartsrevolution, Steve Aoki and Major Lazer, all the while cultivating an underground nightlife movement around his DJ and music events in NYC. His embrace of the current revival of the post-punk emo genre of darkwave led to another rebirth, this time as the artist Rare Form. Musically, Rare Form offers the listener an unlikely fusion of darkwave and R&B, what Alternative Press calls "goth slow jams." Prince Terrence’s richly layered vocals drive these hallucinatory lullabies, taking the audience on a darkly evocative journey into sensual narcosis. Hallmarked by diffused synth beats, orchestral ballads, and purple party vibes, Rare Form's music is a plaintive pop daydream that nods to ’90s trip-hop but stays firmly focused on the future. For his Lincoln Center debut, Rare Form presents new work and classic songs from his Softcore EP.

Run Amok: Asian Americans in Hardcore Punk Ft. Dog Breath, Material Support, & No Model
David Rubenstein Atrium
Three Asian American-led East Coast hardcore punk bands—No Model, Material Support, and Dog Breath—join forces for an epic showcase.The name of the evening, "Run Amok," intentionally refers to "Amok Syndrome," a behavioral pattern formerly once recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a "culture-bound syndrome"—born out of the European misdiagnosis of Asian and Indigenous peoples' spirit of defiance in the face of colonization. Lyrically, these groups create music that addresses generational trauma, racism, war, social justice, and liberation in service of opening a conversation about the state of the punk scene and the use of the genre to assert fully empowered Asian American narratives rooted in anti-colonial resistance. Their work embraces the struggle of every person raging against oppression and inequality, both at home and abroad.

The Flat Earth Society Orchestra
David Rubenstein Atrium
The Flat Earth Society Orchestra (FES) mixes the rich Northwest European brass band tradition with oddball topsy-turvy creativity. Taking Belgian whimsy to a logical, irresistible extreme, FES straddles the border between multi-color surrealism and savvy skill. Composer, reed player, producer, and bandleader Peter Vermeersch, co-piloted by pianist and composer Peter Vandenberghe, have shaped their 15-piece orchestra into one of the most productive and thrilling bands of its kind. While Flat Earth Society’s compositions and arrangements betray 20th century traditions—from jazz to rock, exotica and contemporary music—they embody a decidedly forward-looking 21st century spirit. Quick-witted, effortlessly eccentric and always on the lookout for new challenges, Flat Earth Society is that rare beast: a constantly evolving orchestra that is most in its natural environment at a live show. This performance of the Flat Earth Society celebrates the Atrium’s 15-year anniversary in tandem with the band’s 25th—a happy reunion after FES’s previous performance in the Atrium in 2011.

Douglas Lora and Irene Atienza
David Rubenstein AtriumThe enchanting Spanish vocalist Irene Atienza and the versatile Brazilian guitarist Douglas Lora each perform with the great musical inheritances of their respective countries kept closely in mind. As a duo they excel at skillful interpretations of the classic Latin catalog of boleros, fados, tangos, sambas, and bossa nova, all delivered in the manner of reverent tradition, but their repertoire also includes new and thoroughly modern compositions. Atienza and Lora’s delicate artistry compels a performance experience that is intimate, sophisticated, and powerful. The duo's latest project is an album of music drawn from the formidable catalog of the late ranchera icon, Chavela Vargas. The immortal grande dame of Mexican song, Vargas was a unique cultural figure and queer trailblazer whose 50-year career forever changed the canción ranchera canon. Lora and Atienza will present several works by Vargas along with folk ballads from Cuba and Brazil.

Treya Lam and Kaki King
David Rubenstein Atrium
Over the past 15 years, the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center has presented literally thousands of free concerts. In celebration of our crystal anniversary, the Atrium is hosting a series of return engagements throughout our 2024/2025 season to welcome back a few of our favorite performers. Rolling Stone Magazine has called Kaki King "a genre unto herself." With a musical career that has already spanned two decades, Kaki King continues to lead the charge at the forefront of guitarists and art-makers. Treya Lam is a classically trained, nonbinary, Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter whose joyously complex identity informs but does not define their work. Their strident voice, socially charged lyricism and fluent instrumental prowess on guitar, piano and strings inspired King to sign Treya to her Short Stuff Record label in 2018. Together, Lam and King will co-host a very special evening of conversation and live music featuring these creative powerhouses.
+ERBA: A Forest in the City
Clark Studio Theater
+ERBA is an interactive family show with two dancers who create—together with children—an imaginary city. The 'architect' dancer observes the landscape and draws the city with houses and streets. The other dancer loves the earth, the insects, and draws grass and trees. The two characters move in an empty scene where projections on two large, aligned screens evoke a room of wonder. Here their ideas, imagination, and projects are drawn from movement and come to life. The architect creates houses full of color and light, the other dancer redesigns them by adding grass and trees. Slowly an imaginary city grows by combining their different sensitivities. The newborn city becomes a living environment and new characters and new events are added. The children come to color and populate the city. Insects appear, the seasons change; and the city gets bigger, busier, and more complex. Their dream of a green city is coming true. But there is also a factory that grows and grows, scaring away insects, birds, people and making greenery disappear. Together with the children, the dancers will design a new space where nature will grow and where a 'tree concert' can be expected.
Piotr Kurek
Unsound New York
David Rubenstein Atrium
The Polish-based Unsound Festival has made a vital New York home at Lincoln Center for over 12 years. Unsound challenges traditional presumptions of contemporary composition with unique staging, unlikely instrumentation and passionate presentation from artists who draw liberally and without prejudice from the wells of folk, experimental, and chamber music. Warsaw composer and musician Piotr Kurek’s acclaimed LP Smartwoods is a sprawling root system of tiny melodic phrases that loop around subtly evolving instrumental thickets. Kurek takes his cues from early music, baroque and experimental jazz, entangling his influences with filigree traces of contemporary computer audio. Structured in seven distinct segments, the album blurs its acoustic and electronic elements into an illusory hedge of abstract sound. Kurek will perform his set with an ensemble of three local musicians on synths, guitar, bass, wind instruments and harp, with each player delicately intertwined into the Smartwoods. Another act will be added to the lineup soon, forming a double bill.
Curated by Mat Schulz, Unsound Artistic Director 
Unsound is co-organized by Fundacja Tone and co-presented by the Polish Cultural Institute New York. This project is co-financed by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland from the Culture Promotion Fund in partnership with the Adam Mickiewicz Institute.
Kali Malone’s All Life Long / Raphael Rogiński
Unsound New York
Alice Tully Hall
Stockholm-based American composer and organist Kali Malone returns to New York City to present the organ, choir, and brass pieces from her highly acclaimed album All Life Long. In her hands, experimental minimalist reinterpretations of centuries-old polyphonic compositional methods become portals to new ways of perceiving harmony, structure, and introspection. She will perform on Alice Tully Hall’s iconic pipe organ with additional 4-handed organ accompaniment by Stephen O'Malley, together with Anima brass quintet and members of the Choral Chameleon choir. The virtuosic Polish guitarist Raphael Rogiński presents a live performance of his landmark 2015 album, Rogiński Plays Coltrane & Langston Hughes, soon to be reissued by the Unsound imprint. He will present distinct and nuanced interpretations of John Coltrane’s compositions, removing them almost entirely from the jazz context, as well as pieces that he has built around the writing of American poet and social activist Langston Hughes. Joining him on stage is drummer Jim White—of the Dirty Three and a myriad of other projects—as well as vocalist Amirtha Kidambi.{C}
Alba Carmona
David Rubenstein Atrium
A devoted student of roots traditions, the Spanish singer and songwriter Alba Carmona is a musical chameleon, moving effortlessly between Spanish, Mediterranean and Latin American traditional and folk genres. Over the course of a 20-year career, Carmona has performed on countless stages around the world, took part in flamenco and jazz projects with artists such as saxophonist Perico Sambeat, flamenco pianist Chano Domínguez and served as the lead singer of bold female flamenco band Las Migas. Carmona's second solo album, Cantora, is a tribute to the history of recorded sound and the richness and personality of music gleaned from the oral tradition. Her concert will render through her flamenco roots a broad range of folk songs of her own and those carefully arranged, journeying across the globe to uncover where these songs have further evolved. Prepare for a raw and thrilling experience, where voices, guitar, violin, and percussion become the vehicles that transport us from the foundation of our shared past to the present day.{C}
SUNN O))) and Mabe Fratti
Unsound New York
David Geffen Hall
SUNN O))) returns to the live aspect in its core, original raw form. Founders and guitarists Stephen O’Malley and Greg Anderson perform at David Geffen Hall as a duo immersed in profound valve amplification, spectral harmonics, distortion, and volume. Their excursions into pure and primeval riffs of temporality and massively heavy structures of sound pressure have been challenging how we think about music for twenty years. Witness a live experience of physical sound, fog, and glacial maximalism like no other. The evening begins with a notably less thunderous set from the Guatemalan cellist and vocalist Mabe Fratti. Fratti's music blurs the borders between folk, jazz, and avant rock, in service of rich, multi-layered works that center around her striking voice. She performs in the wake of her most recent album Sentir Que No Sabes, which brings her sound even closer to pop, though always driven by an experimental urge.

David Rubenstein Atrium

Colombian soprano, TOND founder, and Bedford-Stuyvesant resident Sasha Gutiérrez, stage director Rebecca Miller Kratzer, and Latin GRAMMY Award-winning bassist and composer Pedro Giraudo have recontextualized Carmen through a modern, Latin American lens. In a reduced, tango adaptation set in a Buenos Aires café, passion, jealousy, fate, and hope unfold as Carmen takes control over her destiny. La Carmencita features a tango adaptation of the score by Giraudo, who plays alongside his acclaimed quartet as the opera's intimate orchestra. The opera will be performed in a new Spanish translation with English subtitles.

David Lang’s poor hymnal
Alice Tully Hall
A winner of the Pulitzer, GRAMMY, Bessie, and Obie Awards, NYC-based artist David Lang is one of America's most highly esteemed and in-demand composers. A co-founder of the tremendously influential Bang on a Can ensemble, Lang's work has been performed at concert halls and theaters around the world, including numerous times at Lincoln Center. In the New York premiere of poor hymnal, a concert-length work written for the multiple GRAMMY Award-winning chamber choir The Crossing, Lang considers the lyrical content of hymnals, which are woven into the fabric of almost all religions as a musical catalog of ideals that worshipers and clergy collectively agree upon. The songs in these bodies of work generally consider how we treat other people, particularly those who are less fortunate. With poor hymnal, Lang plays devil's advocate with a deceptively simple question: do the hymns we sing and hear today in a nonsecular setting reflect a society that feels a responsibility to care for and support each other?  
Wonderful Joe: By Ronnie Burkett
Under the Radar at Lincoln Center
Clark Studio Theater
Presented in collaboration with Under the Radar
Recommended for ages 16+“Paint gold in the part of me that is broken. Let my faultline shine, these golden precious scars are fine, divine, and mine.”
Joe and his dog Mister lose their home, and facing separation, head into the world for one last grand adventure together. The world seems broken, but Joe sees magic in the mundane, beauty amidst brutality, and life in the lost and lonely. He and Mister encounter Mother Nature, Santa Claus, Jesus and the Tooth Fairy, witness a troupe of homeless players in a cardboard theater, and show a disenfranchised teen how to jump over the moon in a playground rocket ship. A seemingly simple tale of a simple man, Wonderful Joe is a love letter to imagination, hope, and the art of filling broken hearts with gold. Ronnie Burkett brings this story to life with his signature style of beautiful puppetry and solo performance, with a glorious score and soundscape by John Alcorn.

De La Soul
Wu Tsai Theater, David Geffen Hall
Forever representing New York City, Long Island, and the mighty Native Tongues clique, De La Soul's sui generis combination of outrageously skilled wordplay, mischievous flights of poetic fancy, and eclectically omnivorous musical sampling put them at the forefront of Hip-Hop's golden age. Over the group's 35 year career, De La Soul has collaborated with virtually every major rap artist and produced nine classic albums, including their groundbreaking platinum LP 3 Feet High and Rising. Two recent seismic events have served to redefine the group for 2025 and beyond: the overdue addition of their stellar catalogue to audio streaming services and the untimely passing of founding member David "Trugoy the Dove" Jolicoeur. Following in the footsteps of an already legendary 2023 memorial celebration, De La Soul's headlining debut at David Geffen Hall represents their first major show in NYC in 16 months and a landmark moment for the future of Hip-Hop.
