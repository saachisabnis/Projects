Fresh off of headlining Bonnaroo on Friday night, Post Malone kept the warm Tennessee vibes going by making his debut at Nashville’s iconic Bluebird Café on Monday night. In the true fashion of Bluebird’s standard in-the-round style performances, Posty was joined by country stars Lainey Wilson and Ashley Gorley on this special night in the intimate 90-seat venue. The writers’ round sets were filled with each singer’s big hits and choice covers, with Post Malone offering up a solo rendition of the No. 1 song in the country, “I Had Some Help,” along with his double-Diamond smash hit, “Sunflower.” 
Wilson played her hit single, “Wildflowers and Wild Horses,” and a duet with Ernest on their collaboration, “I Would If I Could.” “I dreamed about playing the Bluebird, and there’s such an energy in this room,” Wilson said during her set, before affectionately telling Post Malone, “I’m so glad you are getting to play this place.” (Billboard)
