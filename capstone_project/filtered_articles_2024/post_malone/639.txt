The star closed out his show at Boston’s Fenway Park on Wednesday night (Sept. 18) with guest appearances from Ernest and Hardy. The tour will come to a close near the end of October with another big stop at Nashville’s Nissan Stadium.
“Pour Me A Drink” currently sits at No. 6 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart and No. 3 on the Mediabase chart.
