Post Malone delivered a heartfelt tribute to late country legend Toby Keith when he took the stage for his first-ever stadium show over the weekend in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee.
In a video shared on Keith’s social media accounts on Sunday (October 20), Post performs “Wish I Didn’t Know Now” for thousands of fans at Nissan Stadium during his “F-1 Trillion Tour” stop on Saturday night (October 19). Keith released “Wish I Didn’t Know Now” on his self-titled debut album in 1993, along with “Should’ve Been A Cowboy” and other highlights.
Post Malone also attended the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum Medallion Ceremony on Sunday evening, where Keith was inducted into the Hall of Fame, along with John Anderson and James Burton. Post Malone performed “I’m Just Talking’ About Tonight” during the induction ceremony in Keith’s honor. Eric Church performed “Don’t Let the Old Man In,” and Post’s “Pour Me A Drink” duet partner, Blake Shelton, played a medley of “I Love This Bar” and “Red Solo Cup.”
Keith “passed peacefully last night on Feb. 5 surrounded by his family. He fought his fight [with stomach cancer] with grace and courage,” according to a statement shared the morning of February 6. The Oklahoma-born singer-songwriter was 62. Watch Post Malone pay tribute to the late legend here:
