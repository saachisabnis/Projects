Did Blake Shelton write "Austin" about Post Malone? No, but that's what Posty always believed, thanks to his mother.
"Austin" — actually written by David Kent and Kirsti Manna — was Shelton's debut single, from his self-titled 2001 debut album. But Post Malone — birth name Austin Richard Post — says that his mother, who loved country music, told a young Austin Malone that the song was written about him, and he believed it.
Per American Songwriter, Post told this story to Shelton when the two were working together on Malone's much-anticipated country album, F-1 Trillion. Now, obviously, Shelton's song wasn't written about an unknown first grader, but you'd have tough luck convincing little Posty of that when the song was popular.
“Post’s real name is Austin, and he told me that when he was a kid, his mom told him that that song was written about him,” Shelton tells American Songwriter. “That’s what he told me, and he said he believed it."
"His mom was, I guess, the country music fan in the family, and his dad was the rock guy. So, I guess that’s how Post Malone was created.”
Malone tapped into the country world for help with his upcoming album. Not just Shelton — Jelly Roll, Dolly Parton, Hank Williams Jr., Luke Combs and Lainey Wilson are just a few artists of the who will appear alongside Post.
F-1 Trillion is set for an August 16 release, followed by the F-1 Trillion Tour, kicking off in September. The debut single, "I Had Some Help" with Morgan Wallen, is holding down the top spot on the country Billboard chart and the Billboard pop chart.
