Post Malone appeared to reveal his next country collaboration on Wednesday afternoon (June 26).
The “Sunflower” hitmaker posted a sneak peek of an unreleased anthem with reigning Country Music Association Male Vocalist of the Year Chris Stapleton. Though he didn’t reveal the title or a possible release date as of publication time, the song would mark Post’s latest collaboration with one of the genre’s biggest artists.
Most recently, Posty released “Pour Me A Drink” with Oklahoma-born singer-songwriter Blake Shelton. The duo released the song and premiered the high-energy music video after delivering a surprise performance on the main stage at CMA Fest earlier this month. A three-hour CMA Fest concert special — including Post Malone’s performance with Shelton — is now available on Hulu.
Before that, Post Malone dropped a highly-anticipated collaboration with Morgan Wallen. The two joined forces to deliver the debut live performance of “I Had Some Help” before its release at the 2024 Stagecoach Festival in California. In addition to major country festivals, Post has taken the stage at the 59th ACM Awards and the 57th CMA Awards, where he also performed with Wallen (and HARDY) for a surprise tribute to the late Joe Diffie.
Post Malone announced the stops on his headlining “F-1 Trillion Tour” earlier this week, and confirmed long-awaited details about his upcoming 18-track album. F-1 Trillion is due on August 16.
