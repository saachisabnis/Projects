	The song, which ruled Country Airplay for four weeks beginning in June, is Post Malone’s sixth Pop Airplay No. 1 and Wallen’s first. (It became the 13th of Wallen’s 14 Country Airplay leaders.) Post Malone last led Pop Airplay with “I Like You (A Happier Song),” featuring Doja Cat, in 2022; he first reigned with “Psycho,” featuring Ty Dolla $ign, in 2018.

	“I Had Some Help” is just the second song ever to top both Country Airplay and Pop Airplay (since the lists launched in 1990 and 1992, respectively). Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” commanded Country Airplay for two weeks in November 2008 and Pop Airplay for a week in February 2009. (Republic Records has promoted both singles to pop radio.)

	Plus, thanks to “I Had Some Help” and Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” up to No. 1 on Country Airplay as it holds at its No. 5 high on Pop Airplay, the charts share two top five hits simultaneously for the first time. To date, only 10 songs have reached the top five of both rankings at all; Wallen and Swift boast two each.

Songs to Hit the Top Five on Both Country Airplay & Pop Airplay:

	Related to country and pop crossover hits, seven titles have hit the top five of both surveys but via two versions each: “Back at One” (by Brian McKnight and Mark Wills, in 1999-2000); “(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You” (*NSYNC, and Alabama feat. *NSYNC, 1999); “I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing” (Aerosmith and Mark Chesnutt, 1998-99); “How Do I Live” (Trisha Yearwood and LeAnn Rimes, 1997); “Nobody Knows” (The Tony Rich Project and Kevin Sharp, 1996-97); “I Can Love You Like That”  (John Michael Montgomery and All-4-One, 1995); and “I Swear” (Montgomery and All-4-One, 1994).

	Additionally, Whitney Houston crowned Pop Airplay for nine weeks in 1992-93 with “I Will Always Love You.” Dolly Parton, who penned the classic, led the Hot Country Songs chart with her versions in 1974 and 1982.
