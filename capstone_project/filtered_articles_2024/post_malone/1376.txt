Xperi’s DTS has unveiled the most listened-to songs in vehicles around the world for Q3 2024, with Country music continuing its dominance in the US. Several new tracks also made their way to the top of the charts in the US, UK, and globally.
Based on data from the DTS AutoStage Broadcaster Portal, Shaboozey’s “Bar Song (Tipsy)” hit #1 in the US, followed by Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help,” at #2. Another notable entry was Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” hitting #5 in the States, fueled by social media. This includes radio airplay and on-demand streaming.
Previous chart-leader Teddy Swims fell off the list after a complete turnover from Q2.
Globally, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” which won Song of the Year at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, took the #1 spot, while it ranked #2 in the UK and #3 in the US. Carpenter’s success continued with, “Please, Please, Please,” which landed in the Top 10 across the US, UK, and globally. Meanwhile, TikTok star Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” maintained strong traction, staying in the Top 5 globally and in the UK.
DTS AutoStage provides analytics for radio broadcasters, revealing where, when, and what listeners are tuning into in vehicles equipped with the technology.
Xperi SVP of Broadcast Joe D’Angelo said, “In the past year, our reports have highlighted the country crossover of Tracy Chapman’s ‘Fast Car’ by way of Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, and Beyoncé, and now, Post Malone and Shaboozey are making country waves with in-vehicle listeners. The trend of artists seamlessly crossing genres and categories appears to be here to stay and, as our Top Most Listened-To Songs In-Vehicle charts confirm, listeners are here for it.”

Wow, interesting data! Surprising to see country still dominating in-car listening. I wonder if demographics play a big role here? Maybe people just need something less stressful than navigating traffic, unlike playing Flappy Bird. LOL. Seriously though, more research into listener age and location would be helpful. Keep sharing these insights!
This is such an exciting time for music, with genre crossovers and global hits reshaping the charts! Sabrina Carpenter’s success is inspiring, and the in-vehicle listening data from DTS AutoStage offers fascinating insights. Speaking of trends, have you checked out the rising buzz around Infinite Craft? Its immersive gameplay and creative community are creating waves, much like these musical achievements.
It’s exciting to see Country music maintaining its lead in US in-vehicle listening! Songs like “Bar Song (Tipsy)” and collaborations with artists like Post Malone show how diverse and popular the genre has become.
