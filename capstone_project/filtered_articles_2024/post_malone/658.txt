NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A fun weekend in Nashville ended with heartbreak for a Maryland woman after she lost her wedding rings.
Lauren Bolewski came to Nashville to attend the Post Malone concert Saturday night at Nissan Stadium with friends and family.
She said she remembers having her rings throughout the concert but after leaving the stadium, she still needed help putting the puzzle pieces together.
Bolewski said after leaving the stadium, she walked toward the pedestrian bridge to Barlines inside the Omni Nashville Hotel. She used pictures taken on Saturday night as a photo map to retrace her steps.
She said a photo from outside the stadium at 11:32 p.m. shows that her rings are still on her finger, but around 12:30 a.m. the stacked set is missing.
She had to board a plane back to Maryland Sunday morning empty-handed.
After sharing her story on Facebook, Bolewski said a woman is organizing a group with metal detectors to search the area near the pedestrian bridge and going towards the Omni Nashville Hotel.
“That’s insane to me that there’s people out there that would do something like that for a stranger. It makes like my heart….I don’t want to cry. I’ve been crying for like, literally, 24 hours. I don’t even know,” Bolewski said.
Bolewski said she contacted Stadium Security, the Metro Nashville Police Department, the Omni hotel, and even Post Malone’s team about her lost wedding rings but hasn’t had any luck.
