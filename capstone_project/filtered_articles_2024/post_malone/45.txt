Post Malone has now added another movie credit to his extensive resumé.
The rapper/singer appears to have a part in the upcoming remake of Road House, starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the role that the late Patrick Swayze made famous. On Tuesday (February 13), the official account for Prime Video on X, formerly known as Twitter, sent out a photo of the “Circles” performer in the role of “Carter.”

That prompted Gyllenhaal to take to his Instagram page to share a photo of himself with Post Malone. “A man of many talents. To say it was a pleasure working together is an understatement. Welcome to the #roadhouse @postmalone !” he wrote in the caption.
Check out the two posts below.
This isn’t the first time that Post Malone has had a role in a feature film.
Back in 2021, he snagged a part alongside renowned tough guy Jason Statham in Guy Ritchie’s action-thriller Wrath of Man.

In a trailer released on March 29 of that year, the “Circles” hitmaker stars as a bad guy who faces off with Statham. As Johnny Cash’s 1957 song “Folsom Prison Blues” plays in the background, Post ends up on the wrong side of the shootout after Statham steps out of an armored security truck and puts an end to an attempted heist.
Wrath of Man — a remake of 2004 French film Cash Truck — hit the theaters on May 7 of that year, with co-stars including Holt McCallany, Jeffrey Donovan, and Josh Hartnett.

Post Malone previously had a voice cameo in 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, with his Hot 100 No. 1 single “Sunflower” with Swae Lee also appearing on the soundtrack. He later made his visual acting debut in the 2020 action-comedy Spenser Confidential, which starred Mark Wahlberg in the lead role.
In a February 2020 interview with Variety, Wahlberg praised Post for his first-ever acting performance on screen.

“He killed it,” Wahlberg said. “I wanted to cast him in the movie, [director Peter Berg] wasn’t really sure just because he never really saw him act and we didn’t have time to audition him. But, not only did I convince Pete to hire him, I also convinced him to give [Post Malone] two parts and combine them.”
He continued, “When we finally got to the set — we were actually at Posty’s trailer — Posty would not rehearse the scene and he wouldn’t do his real voice. He was making some crazy voice, so Pete was even more scared. You could tell Posty was a little nervous… but then we went in and on the first take he absolutely killed it.”
