The stars lit up the red carpet at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. 
Music’s biggest names blessed Us at the Monday, April 1, event with gorgeous gowns, cutout frocks, textured two-pieces — all paired with glam to remember. 
Of course, the ceremony is not just about fashion. Fan-favorite stars including Taylor Swift, Doja Cat and Miley Cyrus are up for Pop Artist of the Year. Beyoncé, meanwhile, will be honored with the iHeartRadio Innovator award. 
The tribute comes after the hitmaker, 42, dropped her highly anticipated country album, Cowboy Carter, on Friday, March 29. The record is the second installment in the trilogy that began with Renaissance in 2022. In addition to her previously released singles “16 Carriages” and “Texas Hold ‘Em,” Cowboy Carter features tunes with guest appearances by Cyrus, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Linda Martell and Post Malone.
