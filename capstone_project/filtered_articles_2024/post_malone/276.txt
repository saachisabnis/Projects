In addition to performances from Bones & The Raging Idiots, the show featured Sam Hunt, Jon Pardi, Megan Moroney, Ben Rector, Ian Munsick, Nate Smith, Mat Kearney, Edwin McCain, Grace Bowers and Lauren Watkins.
Fans were also treated to surprise appearances throughout the night. Rock band Lit performed their hits “My Own Worst Enemy” and “Miserable.” Country band Turnpike Troubadours hit the stage with “Diamonds & Gasoline” and “Good Lord Lorie.”
The last performance of the night was Bones bringing pop superstar Post Malone onto the stage for his unofficial Ryman debut. Post Malone treated the crowd to a cover of Hank William’s “Honky Tonk Blues” and his current single “Stay.”
Since 2014, Bones and The Bobby Bones Show have raised over $24.8 million to help kids fight cancer and life-threatening diseases.
