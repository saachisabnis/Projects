She is now the first artist in history to win 'album of the year' four times.
In her acceptance speech, Swift gave a shout-out to her friends Jack Antonoff and Lana Del Rey."I get to work with one of my best friends who is not only one of my best friends but also a once-in-a-generation producer. That's Jack Antonoff. I'm so lucky," she began.
She added, "But I think so many female artists would not be where they are and would not have the inspiration they have if it weren't for the work that (Lana has) done. I think she's a legacy artist, a legend in her prime right now. I'm so lucky to know you and to be your friend."Swift also noted the things that bring her the most joy in the industry. "I would love to tell you that this is the best moment in my life. But I feel this happy when I finished a song or when I cracked the code to a bridge that I love or when I'm shot listing a music video, or when I'm rehearsing with my dancers or my band or getting ready to go to Tokyo to play a show," she said, teasing the 2024 start of The Eras Tour next week.""For me, the award is the work. All I want to do is keep being able to do this. I love it so much. It makes me so happy. It makes me unbelievably blown away that it makes some people happy who voted for this award too. All I want to do is keep doing this. So thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to do what I love so much," Swift concluded. (ANI)
