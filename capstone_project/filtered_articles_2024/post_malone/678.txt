Post Malone released his collaboration with country hitmaker Blake Shelton to kick off the weekend on Friday (June 21). “Pour Me a Drink” arrives weeks after the duo posted sneak peeks on their social media pages and delivered a surprise performance on the main stage at CMA Fest, the longest-running country festival in the world, in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee.
Posty’s performance with Shelton is one of 30 confirmed to air during a televised CMA Fest concert special in the coming days. Other performers include Kelsea Ballerini, Luke Bryan, Shaboozey, Lainey Wilson and many more, including surprise guests. It’s all hosted by Jelly Roll and Ashley McBryde. CMA Fest will air on Tuesday, June 25 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT on ABC. It will be available to stream the following day on Hulu.
“Pour Me a Drink” is the latest anthem to release from Post Malone’s highly-anticipated album, F-1 Trillion. He confirmed earlier this week that the 18-track project will arrive later this summer. It also includes Post Malone’s hit single with Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help,” which made its debut last month. Malone and Wallen teamed up to perform the song before its release at the 2024 Stagecoach Festival in California.
Post Malone has been stirring anticipation for his country era for months. He’s taken the stage at massive country festivals and performed at star-studded award shows. He performed at the 59th ACM Awards — including an impromptu duet with host and beloved country legend Reba McEntire — and at the 57th CMA Awards, where he joined Wallen and HARDY for a surprise tribute to late country star Joe Diffie. Post Malone has been teasing unreleased songs on his social media pages, including a collaboration with award-winning artist Luke Combs and a heartfelt father-daughter ballad. F-1 Trillion will arrive on August 16.
