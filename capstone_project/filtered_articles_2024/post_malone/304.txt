Get ready for two more amazing concerts here in Iowa this summer!
Back in December, we found out the first two headliners for the 2024 Hy-Vee INDYCAR Race Weekend Concert Series at the Iowa Speedway in Newton. It was revealed that Luke Combs will be taking the stage BEFORE the first NTT INDYCAR SERIES race on Saturday, July 13th, and that Post Malone will perform AFTER the final race on Sunday, July 14th. At the time, the press release noted that additional entertainment acts would be announced in the "coming weeks." That time has finally arrived!
Just this morning (February 8th), Hy-Vee revealed the final two acts that will perform at this year's event. Country star Eric Church will take the stage after the final Saturday race, while Kelsea Ballerini will do a set on Sunday following the final NTT INDYCAR SERIES race before Post Malone goes on. Kelsea will perform for one hour, but Luke Combs, Eric Church, and Post Malone will all perform for 90 minutes. According to the press release from Hy-Vee:
"All headline artists will perform on the Hy-Vee Stage, located trackside in front of the main grandstands at Iowa Speedway. A limited number of exclusive trackside concert viewing passes are also available for purchase."
This will be the third Hy-Vee INDYCAR Race Weekend and it is expected to draw a HUGE crowd. The 2023 event brought in 85,000 fans over the course of the three days, which was "an all-time high for an INDYCAR event at Iowa Speedway." Tickets are already on sale for the 2024 event and can be purchased on the Hy-Vee INDYCAR Race Weekend website HERE.
