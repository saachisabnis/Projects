The food lineup for this year's Outside Lands just dropped, and it includes a slew of past festival favorites, along with several notable newcomers to the fest from the local food scene.
While the crowd at Outside Lands may skew a bit younger than it used to, the fest's commitment to providing a very adult array of food, wine, beer, and cocktails remains unchanged. Outside Lands can be credited, certainly, with raising the bar for festival food across the country, with other fests now taking care to offer things to hungry music fans besides soggy pizza and sad nachos.
The 2024 edition, which will be headlined by Post Malone, Kaytranada, Sturgill Simpson, Grace Jones, The Killers, and Tyler, the Creator, will be no exception.
"Our dedication and joy for the last 16 years has been introducing unique culinary experiences to festival goers that they may not have otherwise encountered," says Tanya Kollar, the festival's food curator since 2017. "Outside Lands continues to represent a wide array of the Bay Area's exceptional eateries within arm's reach, while also encouraging exploration of novel tastes and cuisines offered across the festival."
As in previous years, Kollar says that the food and beverage team has taken "pride in highlighting so many businesses that are diverse, and often female-owned or minority-owned." 
There's an emphasis on the portable with much of food array at the festival, and a big-name sandwich newcomer this year that will be sure to attract lines is Saigon Sandwich, which has been slinging inexpensive but delicious banh mi in the Tenderloin/Little Saigon for over two decades.
Also new this year will be another SF stalwart, 2024 James Beard America's Classics honoree Mandalay Restaurant, which has been serving its excellent Burmese food at the edge of Presidio Terrace since 1984.
To cure your five o'clock August fog blues, Oakland's beloved Ramen Shop is joining the food lineup this year too, and will be serving bowls of shoyu ramen with chashu pork, as well as pork lumpia and vegetable fried rice.
Though they closed up shop in the Castro last month, Copas is continuing in the catering game, and they will be serving up their Tijuana-style grilled-meat tacos — as well as a smashburger taco mashup (!) — at the fest.
One of SFist's favorite new restaurants of 2023, Dalida, will also be in the mix at Outside Lands, with Top Chef contestant Laura Ozyilmaz and husband and co-chef Sayat Ozyilmaz offering up Mediterranean fare in the Cocktail Magic area and in the ultra-VIP Golden Gate Club. The Cocktail Magic stand will offer Mediterranean pita burgers, fried calamari po' boys, and blooming fried oyster mushrooms.
Speaking of Cocktail Magic, Polk Street's fancy Bar Iris, which is attached to Michelin-starred restaurant Nisei, will be adding its cocktail wizardry to the taps there — and, in a twist, will also be offering izakaya fare like chicken kara-age to go along with the drinks.
See the full food lineup below, just so that you can start prioritizing your bites three months in advance. Three-day tickets to Outside Lands are now on sale, and single-day passes should be hitting the wires in the next week or two.

Tuesday morning’s unveiling of San Francisco's WNBA expansion team name and logo did not disappoint, as we learn that the team will be the Golden State Valkyries, with a kick-ass Bay Bridge-inspired purple logo.
Protesters are sitting in on the San Jose State campus as of Monday; a protest arrived at a fundraiser for North Coast Congressman Jared Huffman in Sonoma; and succession drama roils a family-owned winery in Napa.
