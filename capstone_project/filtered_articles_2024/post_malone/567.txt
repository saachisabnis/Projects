Stevie Nicks is all for Taylor Swift’s continued happiness — especially if it means her relationship with Travis Kelce is the endgame.
“She’s in a good place right now, and I think she has a good man,” Nicks, 76, gushed to Rolling Stone in a profile published on Thursday, October 24. “I hope they fall deeper and deeper in love and ride off into the sunset.”
The legendary Fleetwood Mac singer added, “He does his thing and she does her thing, and then they come back together and get married and have babies if she wants that. I just want all of that for her.”
Swift, 34, and Kelce, 35, have been together since summer 2023, initially connecting after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end name-dropped the pop star on his and brother Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast.
After months of privately seeing one another, Swift and Kelce made their public debut at one of his Chiefs football games in September 2023.
“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” Swift said in an interview for her 2023 TIME Person of the Year profile. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”
Kelce undoubtedly feels the same, often attending Swift’s Eras Tour shows whenever he has a break from his NFL schedule and other professional commitments. Kelce has also bonded with Swift’s inner circle, including Nicks.
“I like to design blankets. Cashmere blankets are my favorite thing,” Nicks told Rolling Stone. “That is what I buy for my friends if there’s a special occasion. I bought Travis Kelce a blanket.”
The two female singers go way back, as Swift has long thought of Nicks as a role model. Nicks even wrote a poem for Swift’s Tortured Poets Department album booklet when it was released in April. The TTPD song “Clara Bow” also mentions Nicks by name.

“She’s become friends with so many female artists just to be a guiding hand. I can’t tell you how rare that is,” Swift gushed during her Dublin concert this summer, shouting out Nicks, who watched the show from the VIP tent alongside Kelce. “She’s a hero of mine and also someone I could tell her any secret [and] she’d never tell anybody. She’s really helped me through so much over the years.”
While speaking with Rolling Stone, Nicks further elaborated on the women’s kinship.
“She is really smart, but she also went through a lot before,” Nicks said, also pointing out that she has never “taken off” the TTPD charm bracelet that was a gift from Swift.
