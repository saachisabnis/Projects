Post Malone’s new single with Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help,” has broken the record for the biggest streaming day for a country song in the history of Spotify. On its release date of May 10, the jaunty, rollicing track notched an astounding 15.9 million worldwide streams on Spotify. “I Had Some Help” not only recorded the biggest one-day Spotify streaming totals for a country song, but it also set a record for the most single-day streams by an all-male collaboration regardless of the genre. Fittingly, “I Had Some Help” rocketed up to No. 1 on the iTunes and Apple Music charts as a result of the track’s viral sensation. “I Had Some Help” is the debut single from Post Malone’s hotly anticipated country album that is expected to arrive later this year.
