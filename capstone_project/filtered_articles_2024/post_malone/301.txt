The refurbished shop features 61 beauty brands, including Chanel.
The Shilla Duty Free’s newly refurbished beauty store – which features 61 leading brands – is now open for business airside at Incheon International Airport. 
The boutique, described as the location’s only ‘total cosmetics solution store’, showcases a range of prestige brands including Chanel, Dior, Estée Lauder, SK-II, Lancôme and Sulwhasoo.
Chanel cosmetics has returned to the concourse after a nine-year absence, “adding vibrancy” to the shopping experience, according to the retailer.
Other popular brands include Jo Malone, La Mer, Tom Ford, Givenchy, Clarins and Guerlain. Additionally, niche fragrance brands Le Labo, Penhaligon’s and Atkinsons have all made their debut in the concourse.
Post-COVID-19, the concourse store is evolving into a destination which appeals to global customers as travel gradually resumes and more flights are added.
To celebrate the store opening, The Shilla Duty Free is offering a range of promotions, including up to 50% off selected items, in addition to complimentary gifts for purchases from specific brands.
Customers purchasing two cosmetics products receive a 15% discount. Those buying three products receive a 20% discount, with an additional 5% off for membership customers. These promotions are subject to each brand’s maximum discount rate, and some brands may be excluded.
The retailer noted: “As the only duty-free operator simultaneously managing cosmetics and perfume stores in Asia’s three major hub airports – Incheon International Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, and Hong Kong International – The Shilla Duty Free continues to showcase its competitive edge in the cosmetics and perfume sector.”
