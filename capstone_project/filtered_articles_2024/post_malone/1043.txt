Post Malone took the stage at the 59th annual Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards in Frisco, Texas on Thursday (May 16) to debut an unreleased single, belt new Morgan Wallen collab, "I Had Some Help," and sing a surprise duet with country queen Reba McEntire. 
Postey began his performance with an unreleased track, and transitioned into his latest single release with Wallen as the stadium rose to their feet and gave the artist a warm welcome amid his debut on the ACM Award's stage. As if the performance wasn't already electric enough, McEntire joined the standout and the two sang a cover of 1973 hit, "Ramblin' Man" in tribute to Dickey Betts, a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band who passed away last month at age 80. 
Post Malone continues to transition into country music and is welcomed with open arms as he releases cover after cover of country classic and collaborates with country artists in Nashville. The humble superstar had nothing but amazing things to say about recent collaborators and the embracing nature of the country music community during a post-show interview with iHeartRadio's Bobby Bones. 
Other artists that took the stage at this year's ACM Awards included Reba McEntire, Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton, Parker McCollum, Jason Aldean, Laney Wilson, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, Kelsea Ballerini and Noah Kahan, and more! Fans can stream the magic that was the 2024 ACM Awards on Prime Video immediately following the live broadcast, and rewatch it on Amazon Freevee and the Amazon Music app the following evening.
