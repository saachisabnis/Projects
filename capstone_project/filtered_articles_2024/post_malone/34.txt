Post Malone included nearly half of his new F-1 Trillion album on his opening night setlist for a tour that began Sunday night (Sept. 8) in Utah.
The "Guy for That" singer didn't bring out any of the major collaborators for this hometown show — he lives near Salt Lake City — but he certainly didn't shy away from duets. Radio singles like "I Had Some Help" and album tracks like "Wrong Ones" and "Finer Things" accentuated the 24-song performance.

In total, 12 of the 27 songs from the album and its deluxe version were featured on the opening night setlist. The top of the show resembled the top of the album, with "Wrong Ones" and "Finer Things" leading off before he stepped back a few years for "Circles."
Find Post Malone's entire 2024 tour setlist below. "Go to Hell," "California Sober" and "Yours" are three more deep cuts he brought out for the performance. There were no country covers, which is surprising, as he leaned heavily on those for summer shows.
