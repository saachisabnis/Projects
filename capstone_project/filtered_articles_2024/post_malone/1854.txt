Post Malone and Blake Shelton made two surprise appearances together during the opening night of CMA Fest in Nashville on Thursday. Posty turned up at Nissan Stadium for an unannounced solo performance of his Billboard No. 1 hit, “I Had Some Help,” notably without the song’s guest star, Morgan Wallen. Malone then welcomed Shelton to the stage for a rollicking, full-band rendition of their forthcoming country collaboration, “Pour Me A Drink.” Later in the evening, the two music superstars played a stripped-down, acoustic take on “Pour Me A Drink” together during an intimate gig at Shelton’s Ole Red bar, which was rebranded as the Spotify House for the duration of the CMA Fest. No word yet on when the highly-anticipated Post Malone and Blake Shelton collaboration will officially get released, but based on this flurry of promotion on stage and on social media, it should arrive sometime soon.
