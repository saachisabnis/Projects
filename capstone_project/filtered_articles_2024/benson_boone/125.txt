Honey, first-week album sales of 235K is NOT a good look for Ariana Grande.
I think we should focus on Teddy Swims in Best New Artist. Lost Control is predicted to go #1 on the next week Billboard Hot 100 and this song is not eligible for the 2025 Grammys, so Best New Artist would be the only way to award him. And he looks as an artist that could gain more passion and industry support than for example Benson Boone or Flo Milli. He‚Äôs 31 years old and he was looking for a breakthrough for a long time. I think pop, r&b and some rock voters could vote him against others TikTok stars. 
he doesn‚Äôt rlly have anything out during the current eligibility period. maybe he can release part 2 of his album, then i‚Äôll count him as a big contender.
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
Honey, first-week album sales of 235K is NOT a good look for Ariana Grande. 
Not all artists can sell 300K, Ariana has always been in the hit maker category and not an album seller
and Sweetener debut with 231K
We know Teddy Swims submitted ‚ÄúLose Control‚Äù last year but to which genre? Pop? Traditional R&B?
Pop
another pop album nom for ari as expected

Fortunately for her, all her albums yielded hits and decent sales and that‚Äôs enough to enter the pop field.
the Grammy president said he went with 10 b/c Kanye was in 9th. so if Kanye is in 9th, it‚Äôll be 10 again mayhap 
Tree Paine paid him to say that
Kacey Musgraves new album is SO GOOD. Sis deserves an AOTY nod
This will probably be the first year in a long time where the BNA winner is male. I think Teddy Swims‚Äô and Benson Boone‚Äôs buzz will only grow more from here. Then there is a Djo, whose older music is catching on similar to Lizzo. I think Teddy is the current frontrunner. He would appeal to R&B, Pop and Country/Americana voters.
I thought GOAT would retire after Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers

Interscope could have 4 albums in the big 4 that would be bad for all of them, Kacey, Billie, Kendrick and Lady Gaga
TTPD album will have 7 explicit tracks.

Honey, without a committee, Kacey Musgraves is NOT happening in Album of the Year.
I quite love Kacey Mussgraves‚Äôs new album. I think it‚Äôs an improvement over star-crossed which was more generic. This one is so moody and serene. ‚ÄúJade Green‚Äù will be on repeat for me all spring, personally. 
But like‚Ä¶ Kacey has completely crossed over to pop now? I wouldn‚Äôt call this album country tbh. 
If Kendrick drops and it‚Äôs another blockbuster album he needs to win AOTY. He‚Äôs the most overdue artist in the industry.

If she managed to win it‚Äôs because she has enough support, she‚Äôs not Janelle or Lorde

many songs are 100% country but others are just pop songs but without pop production with synthesizers etc.
