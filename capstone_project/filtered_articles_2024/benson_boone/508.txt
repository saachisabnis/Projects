Home    Forums    Music    If not “Beautiful Things”…
Since “Espresso”, “BIRDS OF A FEATHER”, “we can’t be friends (wait for your love)”, and “Good Luck, Babe!” seem like locks, I wanted to see what everyone thinks about the last spot if “Beautiful Things” isn’t it.
I’m not totally sure if Benson Boone will snag that 5th slot. The Pop Solo Performance category favors artists with major celebrity status who have really influenced the music scene, and not just “one-hit wonders”.
Anyway, we’ve had some nice surprises in this category recently, like Bad Bunny and Steve Lacy, but I’m wondering if “Beautiful Things” is really making a significant impact and if the voters will go for it. Right now, the song doesn’t seem to have much resonance despite its streams. What do you think?
it’s honestly such a hard question to answer without knowing submissions from the artists in the poll and also other potential artists
there are a few things i can say:
1. i can’t see any world where Charli makes this category to be honest
2. if Taylor submits ‘Cruel Summer’ or Beyoncé submits ‘BODYGUARD’, they are taking Benson’s spot. if they both submit those songs, i will panic😭
3. if both ‘Too Sweet’ and ‘Agora Hills’ go to pop solo, i think Hozier is more likely but it’s close
as a general comment, i agree this category seems to have had a lot of surprises (and ties?) in recent years, but there doesn’t seem to be much correlation between the surprises so it’s hard to tell
why are these the only options beyonce and charli xcx what the F… ?? 
Beyoncé really feels like a BPSP spoiler, but tbh she shouldn’t submit in Pop if she wants to be taken seriously in Country/Americana. Kacey Musgraves didn’t submit nothing in Pop the year star-crossed was moved from Country to Pop, even though she had previously submitted High Horse in Pop Solo Performance.
You’re right that “Beautiful Things” suffers from Pop voters not being prone to vote for one hit wonders, but it should be noted that Benson will benefit from having alphabet advantage which is a very real thing in the Pop field. Also, for a Pop voter Steve Lacy is also a one-hit wonder.
That being said, ruling out Benson, Taylor Swift is firmly next in line as a name-check. Bey also possible if she submits there (although I think she won’t unless somehow moved from country).
Ariana Grande and Chappell Roan are not locks. I would just say they are highly likely. Outside of Sabrina and Billie, Pop Solo can go many ways. 
They could be joined by Hozier, Benson and Teddy Swims OR they could be joined by Ariana, Chappell and Doja (If Agora Hills goes Pop) or a mix of both. 
Either way, Taylor is not getting nominated. THanks.
My Lineup:
1. Sabrina Carpenter
2. Billie Eilish
3. Benson Boone
4. Chappell Roan
5/6. Hozier
5/6  Ariana Grande
I think we will have a 6 person lineup this year or just 5 if Hozier goes Alternative.  
Also, if Texas Hold “Em gets moved to Pop Solo it will get in. And likely win.
