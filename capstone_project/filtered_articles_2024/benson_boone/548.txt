Grammy nominations voting commenced today, October 4, and continues until October 15, so eligible members of the Recording Academy have 11 days to make their choices. The resulting Grammy noms will be announced on November 8. Voting for winners follows from December 12, 2024, to January 3, 2025 -- happy holidays! -- and then the 67th Annual Grammy Awards telecast is scheduled for February 2, 2025.
But eligible voters can't select nominees in all Grammy categories. They can vote in up to 10 races across three genre fields, though the entire membership can also chime in on Album of the Year; Record of the Year; Song of the Year; Best New Artist; Producer of the Year, Non-Classical; and Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical. This is to ensure that members only vote for the awards where they have the greatest experience and expertise.
But who will be nominated? Music fans have been placing their bets in the big four categories here in our predictions center. We've combined those predictions to generate our official racetrack odds. Come back often, though. We'll be updating our predictions center now that voting has started and intel comes in about who was entered for consideration in the top categories. Until then, though, here's who we're betting on for major bids.
