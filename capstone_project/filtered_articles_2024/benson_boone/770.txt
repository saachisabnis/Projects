By : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//July 25, 2024//  
Happy Olympic Games, everyone! It looks like Oklahoma will be well represented throughout the Olympics in Paris starting Friday, from the Oklahoma City Thunder to Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma, so go USA!
And if you’re not going to Paris for the Olympics, here are some fun things for you to do closer to home or to sign up for:
Arts Council events
The Arts Council Oklahoma City’s Twilight Concert Series wraps up Sunday evening with a free performance from The Sweet Remains band. The concert, sponsored by the Chickasaw Nation, begins at 7 p.m. on the Devon Lawn at the Myriad Botanical Gardens in downtown Oklahoma City. 



The three former solo artists teamed up to form the independent band that has become popular in their harmony, especially on streaming services.
“The Sweet Remains are the perfect way to end a beautiful summer of live music,” said the Arts Council’s executive director, Angela Cozby, in a news release.
The Arts Council OKC is also behind Friday’s “Art Moves” event in the West Village District in Oklahoma City’s Film Row. The block party will be from 6 to 10 p.m. on Lee Avenue and include activities at Sailor & the Dock and performances by singer/songwriter Haley Jane Pierce with John the Forest from 6 to 8 p.m. and magician Joe Coover from 7 to 9 p.m.
