Beyoncé has her first U.K. No. 1 in 14 years, as “Texas Hold ‘Em” blasts to the chart summit. 

	The country-tinged song powers to the top of the Official U.K. Singles Chart, published Friday, Feb. 23, following a No. 9 debut the previous week. 

	Lifted from the forthcoming LP Renaissance Act II (via Columbia/Parkwood Ent) project, due out March 29, “Texas Hold ‘Em” is Beyonce’s sixth U.K. No. 1. Bey’s last was her Lady Gaga collaboration “Telephone,” which she dialed up for a chart leader back in March 2010.

	Before that, the Houston, TX-raised star scored No. 1s with 2008’s “If I Were a Boy,” “Beautiful Liar” with Shakira (2007), “Déjà vu” with Jay Z (2006) and “Crazy in Love” with Jay Z (2003). As a member of Destiny’s Child, Bey bagged a brace of U.K. No. 1s – “Independent Women” (2000) and “Survivor” (2001).

	Following 2023 breakthroughs by Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen, and now a No. 1 with “Texas Hold ‘Em,” country music is “undergoing something of a resurgence” in the U.K., notes the OCC, a market typically dominated by electronic, pop, rock, hip-hop and indie music.

	The runner-up on the latest tally is Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” (Warner Records), up 3-2 for a new chart peak, while Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” (Atlantic) completes the podium, up 4-3, also a peak position. 

	The top new entry belongs to Dua Lipa’s “Training Season” (Warner Records), arriving at No. 4, for the British pop star’s 15th U.K. top 10 single. 

Ariana Grande’s “yes, and?” (Republic Records) is on the rise, up 10-7, following the release of a new remix featuring Mariah Carey. “Yes, and?” has a U.K. chart peak of No. 2. 

Stranger Things star Joe Keery nabs his first U.K. top 40 appearance with “End of Beginning” (AWAL/DJO), through his DJO project. “End of Beginning” rockets 100-11. That’s an “extraordinary” effort, notes the OCC, for an artist known to millions for his central character in Netflix’s Stranger Things Steve Harrington, the bully-turned-reliable chum with great hair.

	Finally, Calvin Harris and Rag’n’Bone Man’s collaboration “Lovers In a Past Life” (Columbia), debuts at No. 19, for Harris’ 43rd top 40 single, and Rag’n’Bone Man’s sixth. The pair previously joined forces on 2019’s “Giant” — both are giant men — which peaked at No. 2.
