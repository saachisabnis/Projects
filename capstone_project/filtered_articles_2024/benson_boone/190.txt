More than 170 acts will play Grant Park in Chicago this weekend, including one of the breakout stars of the summer.
Lollapalooza 2024 kicked off in spectacular fashion at Chicago's Grant Park yesterday, with a weekend lineup that features over 170 artists across eight stages. With headliners including SZA, Megan Thee Stallion, Blink-182, The Killers, Hozier, and Skrillex, the massive festival is known for its mix of established stars and emerging talents, making it one of the most anticipated music events of the summer.

Day 1 of Lollapalooza 2024 was highlighted by standout performances from Chappell Roan, Tyla, Benson Boone, Kesha and Hozier. Chappell Roan delivered a remarkable 5:00 set, drawing one of
the largest crowds in the festival’s history. Taking the stage dressed as a lucahdor, complete with local powerlifters and bodybuilders behind her, yesterday was a reminder that this is now Chappell Roan’s world.

The rest of Lolla’s Thursday lineup was stellar. Kesha brought her signature energy and hits to the IHG Hotels & Resorts Stage, while Tyla mesmerized fans with her set on the T-Mobile Stage in the late afternoon. Hozier, who is set to perform in Madison later this month, closed the night with a soulful performance that left the crowd in awe.
