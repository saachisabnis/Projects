Dancing With the Stars got emotional as they performed for those closest to them on Dedication Night — but before the show was over, one couple got sent home.
Former DWTS pro Mark Ballas (and three-time winner) joined Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli at the judges table on Tuesday, October 15. This marked Ballas’ first appearance back in the ballroom since he won the mirrorball trophy alongside partner Charli D’Amelio during DWTS season 31 in 2022.
During rehearsals, each pair met with one of the judges who gave them tips ahead of the live show.
Stephen Nedoroscik aimed high before heading to the ballroom, telling partner Rylee Arnold that he wanted to get a nine from the judges. After the help of Tonioli, 68, who helped sharpen up their dance in rehearsals, the duo was awarded one of them — thanks to Hough, 39.
Former NFL star Danny Amendola appeared speechless after his contemporary dedicated to his late Texas Tech football coach Mike Leach, which was a “tragic” loss for the athlete in 2022. All four judges praised Amendola for his continued dedication to the competition as well.
Hough pulled out the dramatics after Phaedra Parks hit the dance floor. Following her emotional performance dedicated to her mom (yes, tears were shed) the judge stood up, broke the handle off his five paddle — a reference to last week’s live show — and threw it away. (The showmance continues!)
The show also addressed professional dancer Hayley Erbert‘s “terrifying” brain injury that occurred late last year. She and Hough danced to Benson Boone‘s “Beautiful Things” for a special dedication that brought the ballroom to tears.
“This was the most challenging thing I’ve ever been through in my entire life, physically and mentally,” Erbert told the crowd. “It was a lot on all of us as a family and you never know what you’re capable of until you go through something like this. I am really proud of myself.”
Following the emotional moment, DWTS Dedication Night continued with Brooks Nader — who was joined by her three sisters on the dancefloor — and Gleb Savchenko. Yes, they continued to turn up the heat. “That was mouth-watering spicy,” Tonioli declared.
Just call Ilona Maher the comeback kid. After her breakdown last week, the judges loved her dance this week with Ballas, 38, calling it a “graceful” and “beautiful” routine. “When the going gets tough, Ilona gets going,” Tonioli chimed in.
At the end of Tuesday’s episode, Nader and Savchenko were eliminated.

“It’s been amazing and we have so much fun,” the model said following the news of her elimination. “I just said, ‘Imagine if it was us.’ Maybe I manifested it mistakenly.”
Savchenko shared a sweet message to his partner as well. “You are super talented and I love you,” he gushed.
