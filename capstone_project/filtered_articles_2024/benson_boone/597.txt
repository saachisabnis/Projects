Billie Eilish is opening this week’s Billboard 200 at No. 2 with HIT ME HARD AND SOFT.
Her third studio album debuts with 339,000 equivalent album units in its first week, marking her biggest week so far. The total includes 191,000 in album sales (also her best sales week), 166,500 streaming equivalent album units (193.93 million on-demand streams of the songs) and 1,500 in track equivalent album units. HIT ME HARD AND SOFT gives Eilish her third top 10 effort following Happier Than Ever in 2021 and WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? in 2019.
“Thank you, guys, so much for all of your support on this album,” Eilish and her brother and producer, FINNEAS, shared in a statement. “This week has been so surreal and insane, and we truly could not be more overwhelmed with joy. Love you all until we die. Thank you for everything. Forever.”
