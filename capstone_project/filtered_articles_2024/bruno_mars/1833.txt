In a recent interview with Variety, Anderson .Paak discussed the future of Silk Sonic.
It was a pivotal moment in the music industry when Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars came together to form Silk Sonic. Their collaboration saw two of the greatest respective artists in their field unite to create an infectious, and somewhat cheeky, take on old school R&B, funk and soul. They won four Grammys for their debut single "Leave The Door Open", including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song.

When Variety asked .Paak whether there would be a follow-up to their 2021 debut, An Evening with Silk Sonic, he revealed that he has recently hung out with Mars, and there were no plans to retire. “I think that Silk Sonic always has a place to put out more music, and we’ll always have that group and always have that outlet to do it,” he said. “So, we’ll just see. Time will tell.”
Anderson .Paak recently joined forces with Gwen Stefani to release the official song of the 2024 Olympics.
