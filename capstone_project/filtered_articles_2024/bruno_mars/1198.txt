‘Die With A Smile’ remains at the top of the chart for a second week running.
We’re still not over Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ stunning ballad ‘Die With A Smile’, rumoured to be part of the soundtrack for Gaga’s upcoming movie, ‘Joker: Folie à Deux’.

This is the first time the pair have collaborated, as well as being the first major Gaga hit since ‘Rain On Me’ with Ariana Grande. Little Monsters are patiently waiting for the release of her seventh studio album, hopefully to be released soon!
Elsewhere in the chart, Sabrina Carpenter’s latest bop ‘Taste’ climbed 3 places to Number 4; could we see Sabrina knock Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars off the top spot next week?

We also saw 3 new entries from a little, unknown band called Oasis (anyone heard of them?). ‘Little By Little’ came in at Number 28, ‘Wonderwall - Remastered’ at Number 20 and ‘Supersonic’ secured Number 18. It’s likely we’ll see plenty more Oasis popping up in the Top 40 over the next few weeks as the hype continues around the band’s return.

Myles Smith’s latest single ‘Wait For You’ also entered the chart at Number 30. His massive hit song ‘Stargazing’, this week coming in at Number 7, has remained in the Top 10 for the last 4 weeks!
Could Sabrina Carpenter secure the Number 1 spot next week? Or can Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars hold on for a third week running?
