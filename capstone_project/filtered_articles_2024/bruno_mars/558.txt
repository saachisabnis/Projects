ROSÉ is serving and the numbers don’t lie! The BLACKPINK queen’s latest banger “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars just hit 100M views on YouTube FASTER than any other music video this year — and sis did NOT come to play! 
The track is basically WORLD DOMINATION rn:
Word on the street is our girl’s about to make HISTORY on Billboard Hot 100 next week, potentially becoming the highest-charting K-pop female soloist ever! We see you, queen! 
So why is everyone obsessed? The song’s got that TikTok-ready “piki piki” hook that’s living rent-free in everyone’s head, plus Bruno Mars bringing that superstar energy. Plus, let’s be real – those viral memes and short-form clips are spreading faster than hot gossip! 
ROSÉ spilled the tea about the track’s inspo, telling us it literally came from a game she plays with her friends: “We were just vibing in the studio… I’m just so grateful everyone’s enjoying it!”
Sources close to the industry tell TMZ the track’s success is basically a masterclass in what’s hot rn — especially how those viral memes and short-form vids are taking over FASTER than your ex’s new relationship status! 
BTW, our girl was feeling all the feels about hitting 100M views, saying she had some doubts at first but now she’s living her best life with all the love coming her way! Get it, sis! 
KEEP SLAYING, ROSÉ!
