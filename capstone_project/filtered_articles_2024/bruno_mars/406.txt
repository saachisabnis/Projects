MGM Grand is rolling with Bruno Mars.
It's no secret that the Grammy winner likes to play poker, but when a report surfaced last week claiming he had racked up a colossal debt in Las Vegas, some wondered if there was any truth to the reports. In a turn of events, MGM Grand has shut down those allegations while standing by the "24K Magic" crooner's side, per TMZ. According to the casino, such reports are not valid.
"We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers," said the MGM Grand. "From his shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM to the new Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio, Bruno’s brand of entertainment attracts visitors from around the globe. MGM and Bruno's partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect. Any speculation otherwise is completely false; he has no debt with MGM. Together, we are excited to continue creating unforgettable experiences for our guests."
While the Grammy winner has not addressed the allegations against him, his connection with MGM Grand has grown stronger.
The singer is gearing up for an upcoming residency at the resort.
