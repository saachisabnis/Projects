The finals are here!
After multiple rounds of voting, we only have two songs left that have survived. Can you believe it? And honestly, they are both songs that are so fun to dance to at weddings!

The final vote came down to “The Cupid Shuffle” and “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars.
It seems that when it comes to dancing at weddings, we all really love a song that’s funky and fun. “The Cupid Shuffle” is a classic at weddings, and no one can resist the dance floor when Bruno Mars comes on.
Voting for the finals ends tomorrow on Tuesday, May 14, so make sure you get those votes in!
