Bruno Mars celebrated the grand opening of his Las Vegas lounge The Pinky Ring with a star-studded party during Super Bowl weekend.
Going down on Saturday (February 10), just two days ahead of the spot’s official opening to the public, Bruno partied with the likes of Janelle Monáe, Lady Gaga, Victoria Monét, Babyface, T-Pain, Karrueche Tran, Lucky Daye and more at the venue located inside Bellagio Resort & Casino.

The famed singer also hit the stage with his group The Hooligans for a live performance, and the band will continue performing nightly for the first two weeks of the opening.
Per a press release, “guests will enjoy Bruno’s homage to the entertainers who helped shape Las Vegas and immerse themselves in his vision of timeless glamour and remarkable artistry. Every element of the experience — from the specialty bar program and live entertainment — has been curated by the global superstar as a place for people to get lost in a good time they will remember forever.”

Nick Cannon recently gave Bruno Mars his props as one of his favorite performers – though he caught the ire of Beyoncé fans in the process because he argued that Bruno had more hits than her.
The Wild ‘N Out host made the controversial statement during an episode of his Daily Cannon radio show on Amazon’s Amp last spring, with the debate being sparked by Cannon praising Mars’ live performances.

“Have you ever seen Bruno perform live?” he asked his co-hosts. “Fire! ‘Cause he got his whole crew on stage with him and they be doing the little dances. It feels very Morris Day and the Time-ish.”
“I could probably afford those tickets,” Mason Moussette replied, before bringing up the sky-high prices for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift’s respective tours.

“See, no offense, but I would rather go to a Bruno Mars show than a Beyoncé or a Taylor Swift [show],” Cannon then declared, which was met with bemusement from his colleagues.
“You out your mind,” Courtney Bee Bledsoe remarked while rolling her eyes.

“Who got more hits?” Cannon asked, to which Bledsoe replied with zero hesitation: “N-gga, Beyoncé! What you talkin’ ’bout?”
She then reeled off some of Bey’s solo hits including “Single Ladies,” “Drunk In Love” and “Crazy In Love,” as well as Destiny’s Child classics like “Bills, Bills, Bills” and “Say My Name.”

Feeling the heat, Nick clarified that he’s “a Beyoncé fan,” but doubled down on his hot take by saying: “I still believe Bruno Mars actually has more hit records.”
When challenged to name them, however, Cannon seemingly struggled.

“You’re putting me on the spot,” he said while trying to buy himself more time. “It’s Monday.”
