Lady GagaÂ shared a rare sneak peek inside her private residence in a new TikTok video while promoting her new single Die With A Smile with Bruno Mars.
The always inventive artist, who has been hinting at new music and album for a while, uses a snippet from the bridge section of the track for the opening of the clip.
'When I fantasize about dropping all my new music at once,' she captioned the post.Â 
The 13-time Grammy Award winner can be seen dancing and swaying around her huge dressing room in her house with both arms high up into the air.
Being theÂ chameleon that she is when it comes to style and fashion, the Born This Way star rocked a floral, white-patterned sun dress with a plunging neckline over black leggings with black stiletto boots.

Lady Gaga gave fans a glimpse inside of her home dressing room in a new TikTok video that's in promotion of her new single Die With A Smile with Bruno Mars - and revealed her 13 Grammy Awards on the window shelf
Rounding out her overall look, the New York City native had herÂ dark locks falling down long in the back but partially pushed back off her face with the exception of some strands of hair hanging around the frame of her face with a center part.Â 
Gaga (born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta), 38, subtly danced around as the camera moved around her in a circle.
As the clipped turned fans get a look at her cloths on moveable hangers, as well as a plethora of purse and handbags on top of a large dresser of sorts just behind her.
Just behind that dresser, which is seen a few seconds into the video, the pop superstar has her 13 Grammy Awards neatly placed on a window shelf.
Her MTV Movie & TV Awards and MTV Video Music Awards are also up on shelves above her windows.
As the clip continues to spin, there are several mirrors hanging on the way until the shot comes to a fireplace mantle where she has her Oscar on display, which she won for Best Original Song for Shallow from her film A Star Is Born.
It turns out theÂ singer-songwriter and actress has a love for purses and handbags, considering she had many more in a pile on a small couch, seen in the remaining last few seconds of the clip.

Die With A Smile, which Gaga and Mars wrote withÂ Dernst Emile II, Andrew Watt, and James Fauntleroy, can be categorized asÂ  soft rock in the vein of her big A Star Is Born hit Shallow.
The duo first performed together eight years earlier when they hit the stage for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in November 2016.
It was at that point that they discussed wanting to work with each other on new music.Â 
Gaga has been working on her new music in Malibu when Mars invited her to his studio to play some of his new stuff, one of which was the beginnings of Die With A Smile. 'Blown Away' at what she heard, their pair proceeded to finish writing it that very same day.

Gaga's last studio album was Chromatica (2020), a concept album centering on ideas of unwavering happiness and the pursuit of healing.Â 
Songs on the record encompass themes inspired by failed romance and mental health struggles in Gaga's private life.Â 
In support the album, Gaga embarked on The Chromatica Ball concert series in July 2022, the first all-stadium tour of her career, after it was postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Â
