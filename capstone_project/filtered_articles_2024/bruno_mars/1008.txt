Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions: Pop Field (Part 3)
Now that the eligibility period is over, and before we know the submissions, I put together my ideal Grammy line-up, and i did it based on what I actually would vote for, and not on the probability of winning or being nominated, or past Grammy success (it is not a prediction!). I did it because it’s my favorite thing to read in this forum, when users put their lists of favorites, their hopedictions, etc, I discover so much music like that. It’s in order of preference.

What do guys think chances of Wrecking ball by Dolly and Miley in Pop/Duo. It sounds bit rocky but not that much to be submitted in rock category.

1.) Solid list, I think you’re accurate 
2.) The fact you took time to program the Bold font html for each individual BARF! is borderline psychotic

We’re really getting close even Gucci began sharing their predictions.
I hope Charli goes PVA for the chaos tbh. I struggle to think of a category where the nominees were as predictable as PVA is this year.
I don't even have my lorazepam, I'm going to have to DRINK myself to sleep

Yeah, the wannabe drag queen turned me off with her comments and recent behavior. This is a serious election and her attitude towards society and everything is just so distasteful that if I was a voter I would not vote for someone who doesn’t understand the importance of their platform. Gen Z is the biggest voting bloc this election and while I like her song I would prefer her to be snubbed in Pop.
r&b and rap categories were completely BARF! free, meanwhile pop has a 100% BARF! rate. oh wow

I’m shocked Gucci didn’t BARF! Kanye or Jack Harlow

houdini should be nominated. hell it should even win. truly one of the best pop songs eligible.
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
houdini should be nominated. hell it should even win. truly one of the best pop songs eligible.
But Illusion should absolutely be the Dance Pop submission. That song is such a jam.

Dua Lipa’s dilemma:
– Submit Houdini in Pop Solo Performance and Illusion in Pop Dance Recording in order to maximize her submissions.
– Submit Houdini in Pop Dance Recording because it’s the only category in which she’s getting nominated but then also be competitive for a win.
Honey, Dua Lipa should submit something to both Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Dance Pop Recording.  It does NOT matter what she submits to those two categories.  That lady is NOT winning a damn thing.  The Radical Optimism era was a bust.
