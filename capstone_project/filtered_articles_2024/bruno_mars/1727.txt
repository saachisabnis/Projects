	Both singers (and Super Bowl halftime stars) announced the duet Thursday (Aug. 15), sharing the cover artwork on Instagram. In the photo, the pair sport matching red-and-blue retro Western outfits, with Gaga clutching a cigarette between her fingers and Mars posing with a white cowboy hat on his head.

	The announcement comes just two days after Gaga teased that she was teaming up with the “Uptown Funk!” superstar, posting a video of her performing a tune on piano while wearing a t-shirt with Mars’ face on it. The day before that, the Haus Labs founder commented a series of emojis on the Silk Sonic star’s Instagram post.

	As Gaga teased in her caption, “Die With a Smile” will arrive ahead of the pop icon’s highly anticipated seventh album. She’s kept fans waiting for a new LP since 2020, when she released the Billboard 200-topping Chromatica.

	While in Paris to perform at the 2024 Olympics opening ceremony in July, Gaga took to the streets to share snippets of new songs from the forthcoming album with fans. Popping out of a limousine’s sunroof outside her hotel in the French capital, she simply opened her laptop and played two short snippets for a crowd of eager listeners.
