Bruno Mars, with his Puerto Rican roots, brought his infectious energy and joy to Mexico. After three electrifying performances at the GNP Seguros Stadium, entertaining over 195,000 fans, Mars bid farewell with a delightful video that celebrated Mexico's rich culture, incorporating elements like lucha libre and mariachi music.
In the video, Bruno Mars is dressed in a pristine white suit adorned with Mexican embroidery, sitting before a mirror while holding a golden lucha libre mask. As the strains of "I'm going to Mexico to fiesta" play in the background, Mars dons the mask, and the scene transitions to show him joyfully walking through the vibrant streets of Mexico City. Accompanied by his musicians, who are also dressed in traditional Mexican attire, Mars dances and sings, capturing the essence of the capital's lively spirit.
While his concerts, filled with dynamic performances and smooth choreography, had already won over the crowd, this tribute endeared him even more to his fans. The gesture was further amplified by the heartfelt message he penned alongside the video, expressing his deep affection for the country. "Thank you Mexico City for three beautiful parties. I was able to live a childhood dream and be a fighter for a day. I love you so much Mexico. I love you so much. Enjoy this success until I return!" Mars wrote, signing off as "Your Brunito."
Bruno Mars' connection with Mexico deepened as he became the first artist to perform at the new GNP Seguros Stadium. This milestone has firmly etched his name in the venue's history. His tribute highlighted his appreciation for Mexican culture and solidified his bond with his fans, leaving an indelible mark on all who witnessed his performances.
In 2023, Bruno performed at the JBL Fest in Las Vegas. The launch party was attended by some of the world’s most famous celebrities, including Lenny Kravitz, Madison Beer, Ashlee Simpson, and more. The event was filled with special activities, including karaoke, an open bar, live music, and more. Mars joined D’Mile on the DJ Booth to spin some songs, including some of his biggest successes, including “Locked Out of Heaven.” He also performed Lenny Kravitz’s “I Belong To You.”
Earlier that year, the singer performed at the first "The Town" festival at the Interlagos racetrack in Sao Paulo. He shared an epic video montage on social media showing his time at the festival and walking through the city streets. Fresh from his performances with a smile on his face, the singer wrote, “It’s been 6 long years but I finally ‘Come to Brasil’ Thank you São Paulo for two incredible nights. I LOVE YOU! Sincerely, Your Bruninho.” It seems like the last time the 38-year-old performer was in Brazil was in 2017 for his 24K Magic World Tour.
