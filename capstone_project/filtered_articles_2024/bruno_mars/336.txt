Grammy winner Bruno Mars will officially raise the curtain at the Intuit Dome.
INGLEWOOD, Calif. - The Intuit Dome in Inglewood is the newest entertainment venue in the greater Los Angeles area.
The new home of the LA Clippers offers numerous innovative features that will allow fans a more intimate experience in the 18,000-seat arena. 
Clippers’ owner Steve Ballmer traveled to various stadiums across the nation to find inspiration for the Intuit Dome design, and has cited Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Salt Lake City’s Delta Center, and San Diego State’s Viejas Arena as some of the venues that delivered the best fan experience.
