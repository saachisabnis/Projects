Indonesian influencer Una Dembler, who was filmed spitting on a fellow Bruno Mars concertgoer during a queue dispute, has apologised for her behaviour.
The incident happened last Friday (Apr 5) when ticket holders for the standing pen area were waiting in line for the second of the American singer's three concerts at the National Stadium.
In a video posted by Singaporean influencer Sabrina Sim last Friday, Ms Una is seen gesturing and arguing with several concertgoers seated in a queue to enter the standing pen.
After presumably being told to go to the back of the queue, she praises another man out of frame, saying "this boy is good" because he had nicely informed her to go to the back of the line.
"But he's not throwing rice on my body... okay?... I felt that."
She can be heard repeating "it's your rice, it's your rice", before spitting on one of them – later revealed to be Ms Sim – as her friend comes up to lead her away.
In her TikTok caption, Ms Sim, 22, explained that her group had been queueing behind a man who was going for the concert alone when Ms Una "just sat her buttocks down" in front of him, prompting them to "(stand) up for him and (call) her out".
"She told us, 'I'm waiting for my friend'," Ms Sim wrote. "So we told her nicely, 'This is the front of the queue though, you can go to the back of the queue and wait for your friend'.
"But clearly, she wasn't too happy with being called out even though she was the one who shamelessly tried to cut the queue. Got spit on in the end...
"All I can say is... Those attending on April 5, please be considerate and try your best not to be selfish to others attending the concert."
The TikTok video, which was posted last Friday, has since garnered 2.4 million views, 62,800 likes and 3,670 comments as of Apr 8 afternoon, with many expressing sympathy for Ms Sim and encouraging her to report the incident to the police.
Online users quickly tracked down and identified Ms Una as the perpetrator, flooding her social media accounts with negative comments.
Over the weekend on Saturday, she responded to the backlash in an Instagram Story, claiming that the video circulating was "not 100 per cent true".
She had not intended to join or cut the queue, she added, but was waiting for a friend who had gone to the bathroom.
Ms Una wrote: "Suddenly I felt someone throw rice at my hair and body several times. Then there was a nice guy who told me that this was the line for Bruno Mars, and I immediately stood up and left the queue but the girl still tried to throw rice (at) me.
"I was mad and it is wrong to get emotional and spit at her. Sadly, I don't have the video (of her) throwing rice (at) me.
"Please hear my side, too. I know I was wrong to spit on her but I didn't mean to cut the queue. I will learn from this and I really regret this. I'm sorry... So sorryyy."
Ms Sim reposted a screenshot of Ms Una's Instagram Story in a follow-up video, casting doubt on her claims of having rice thrown at her and of not knowing that she was in the middle of a queue.
"May I also just say that it was broad daylight in the early afternoon and there were many people there?" Ms Sim added.
"If she claimed that people were throwing things at her multiple times, how is it that no one saw that?"
