MGM Resorts has refuted claims that Bruno Mars owes them $50 million in gambling debts. In response to rumors, an MGM rep clarified that "any speculation otherwise is completely false." The original report had alleged that Mars had accumulated substantial debts through his residencies at MGM and was using his profits to settle them.
However, MGM reiterated that Mars "has no debt" with the company and emphasized their strong partnership, stating, "We're proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world's most thrilling and dynamic performers." Mars' representatives did not comment on the matter and referred to MGM's statement.
Mars has been performing in Las Vegas since 2016 and recently collaborated with MGM to launch the Pinky Ring cocktail bar and lounge at the Bellagio.
