This year, the MAMA Awards held two separate ceremonies in the US and Japan, with the first day’s festivities held at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theatre on November 21. It then picked up with a two-night ceremony at Osaka’s Kyocera Dome on November 22 and 23. The winners for most categories were decided through judge panel evaluations, download and stream numbers as well as physical album sales.
A handful of the ceremony’s most prestigious “Grand” awards included Artist of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Other trophies awarded across the three-day international affair included Best Male and Female Groups, Best New Artists, Best Dance Performance in both the solo and group categories, and more.

Following closely behind were SEVENTEEN with five awards taken home: Fans’ Choice Top 10 Male, Best Male Group, Visa Super Stage, as well as two out of four Grand prizes for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year, the latter for ‘Seventeenth Heaven’.
Other notable winners also include BTS‘ Jungkook for Best Male Artist and Best Dance Performance (Male Solo) for ‘Standing Next To You’, while BLACKPINK’s Jennie took home four awards, two of which were shared with Zico for their collaboration single ‘SPOT!’.
