On Dec 24, Instagram user¬†closeto_u_ posted a video of what appears to be CCTV footage of her son's room. In the video, her toddler son can be seen dancing and singing to Apt ‚Äì albeit just its chorus ‚Äì while she was asleep.
The user wrote: "Rose, Bruno Mars...Please save my son, who is addicted to Apt from the moment he wakes up until just before he falls asleep."
Many viewers initially thought it was a looped video before realising that it was a single continuous video of the son chanting "Apateu, apateu" for over 40 seconds.
One user wrote: "I thought the video had looped several times. It turns out it was just playing once. The humidifier on the right is flowing down like a waterfall. Why is this so funny?"
The video has since garnered over 15 million views with many expressing their amusement at the situation.
The video has even caught the attention of Rose who apologised to the user, commenting: "Oh my, I‚Äôm sorry, ma‚Äôam."
