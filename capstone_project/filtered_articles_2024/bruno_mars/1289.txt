At the time of publishing, no other Southeast Asia tour dates have been announced.
The announcement comes as the Silk Sonic singer kicks off a seven-show residency at the Tokyo Dome in Japan from January 11 until January 21. Prior to the upcoming Japan shows, and his newly announced Thailand and Singapore shows, Bruno Mars last performed in Asia in Seoul, South Korea, and Bulacan, the Philippines in June last year (2023).
Bruno Mars last toured performed in Singapore and Thailand in 2018 as part of his 24K Magic World Tour. Bruno Mars’ last solo music came in the form of his 2016 album ’24K Magic’. In 2021, he teamed up with Anderson .Paak to form Silk Sonic. They released the album ‘An Evening with Silk Sonic’ in November that year.
