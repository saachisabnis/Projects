Intuit Dome, the new home of the LA Clippers, is hosting Bruno Mars as its opening act, with the performer set to play two back-to-back shows on Thursday, Aug. 15 and Friday, Aug. 16.
The Inglewood venue will serve as the 14-time Grammy winner’s first gig in Los Angeles County in more than six years.
“We are thrilled Bruno Mars will open Intuit Dome,” said Gillian Zucker, CEO of Halo Sports and Entertainment. “Bruno, who has a strong connection to Inglewood, will undoubtedly deliver an iconic performance that is worthy of this moment, and will leave a lasting impression on everyone who attends these two shows.”
Tickets for both shows go on sale to the general public starting at 10 a.m. Thursday, April 11 at Ticketmaster.com. 
The 17,700-capacity arena, nestled in the same area as the Kia Forum and SoFi Stadium, is also set to host acts such as Usher, Weezer, Sebastian Maniscalco, Phil Whickman, and Brandon Lake, Twenty One Pilots, and Billy Joel.
Mars is still set to perform in Los Vegas for his solo 2024 residency and with the R&B project Silk Sonic, featuring Anderson Paak. Silk Sonic released “An Evening With Silk Sonic” in 2021 and snagged record of the year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.
