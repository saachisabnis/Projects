Dallas Voice

					The Premier Media Source for LGBTQ North Texas				
Queer Music News is a smattering of what’s going on in music by LGBTQ artists and the artists we love.



Here’s a wrap-up of music we’ve received in recent days for your new music Monday.



Dallas-based singer Steven Binko drops new single “Warrior”
Binko is a singer based in Dallas since 2022. He mentioned he’s slowly building up his social network, but that may just mean he’s busy creating new music. The singer released his new single last Friday.


“This song is particularly important to me because it’s an anthem about finding strength in yourself. The last few years have been really challenging for me,” he wrote in an email about his release. “While I don’t expect everyone to relate to my specific experiences, I believe the message of resilience and inner strength in the song is something universal that can resonate with many people.”



See our interview with Binko about his new music and his personal struggles soon here in Dallas Voice.

Corook lifts curtain on new era with “blankets”
 


The queer Nashville-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist began a new chapter on Friday with the premiere of “blankets.”  The track was joined by a docushort which serves as the second episode in Corook’s personal new web series and chronicles their love journey with partner and fellow musician Olivia Barton.




Lady Gaga teams up with Bruno Mars for “Die With a Smile”
One thing our gay bingo cards did not have was this pop ballad duet. On Friday, Academy Award and 13-time GRAMMY-winner Lady Gaga and 15-time GRAMMY Award-winner Bruno Mars teamed up to release their new single “Die With a Smile” This marks the first collaboration for the duo, bringing together their distinct musicality and creativity together on this love ballad.



The pop titans collabed simply as a product of good timing and then mutual respect.



“Bruno and I have a lot of mutual respect for each other and were talking about collaborating. I was finishing up my own album in Malibu and one night after a long day he asked me to come to his studio to hear something he was working on,” Lady Gaga said in the song’s press release. “It was around midnight when I got there and I was blown away when I heard what he had started making. We stayed up all night and finished writing and recording the song. Bruno’s talent is beyond explanation. His musicianship and vision is next level. There’s no one like him.”



While the two teamed up on writing the song, they also produced the track with D’Mile and Andrew Watt.



Mars chimed in on working with the pop diva and queer fave.



“Getting to work with Gaga has been an honor. She’s an icon and she makes this song magical. I’m so excited for everyone to hear it,” he stated in the release.



The duo dropped both the song and video on Friday which Mars co-directed. Watch “Die with a Smile” below:
