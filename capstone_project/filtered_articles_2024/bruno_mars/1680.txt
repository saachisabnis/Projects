TeeRoy's 2 Cents:
MGM declared that “Bruno Mars has no debt with us.”
That statement debunks a NewsNation story that Bruno lost up to $50 million at MGM gambling tables. A Las Vegas n=insider claimed that the resort casino “basically owns” Bruno until he pays off that massive debt.
MGM added on Monday (quote) “We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers. MGM and Bruno's partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect. Any speculation otherwise is completely false.” (Las Vegas Journal-Review)
