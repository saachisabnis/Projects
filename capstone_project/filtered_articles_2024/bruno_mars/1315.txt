‘Any Bruno Mars fan knows Flowers did not achieve all that success on its own’
Miley Cyrus is getting sued for allegedly ripping off elements of a Bruno Mars song for her huge smash hit Grammy winning single Flowers. Whilst Bruno Mars himself is not the plaintiff in the case, the suit has been filed by a company who bought portions of the rights to the song When I Was Your Man.
The allegations leading to Miley Cyrus being sued claim that elements of 2023’s Flowers rip from When I Was Your Man, released by Bruno Mars in 2013. The lawsuit was filed in LA yesterday by Tempo Music Investments – who is claiming Cyrus exploits unauthorised attributes of the Mars track. Flowers’ co-writers Gregory Hein and Michael Pollock are named, along with companies like Target and Apple who distributed the song.
Tempo Music wants to seek damages as well as stop Miley from reproducing, distributing or even publicly performing Flowers. Wild.
The lawsuit reads: “Any fan of Bruno Mars’ When I Was Your Man knows that Miley Cyrus’s Flowers did not achieve all of that success on its own. Flowers duplicates numerous melodic, harmonic, and lyrical elements of When I Was Your Man, including the melodic pitch design and sequence of the verse, the connecting bass line, certain bars of the chorus, certain theatrical music elements, lyric elements, and specific chord progressions.
“It is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that Flowers would not exist without When I Was Your Man. With Flowers, Cyrus, Hein and Pollack have created a derivative work of When I Was Your Man without authorisation.”
This TikTok below compares alleged similarities between the two tracks.
