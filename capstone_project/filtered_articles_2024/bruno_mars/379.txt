The topic of producers knowing the winners in advance (even for a short period of time) has been discussed here many times, so they could have a televised speech from the star/winner and maintain audience.
But I was wondering why this couldnâ€™t be applied to the presenters as well. Like, if you have some A lister presenting an award that perhaps you donâ€™t even care about makes you stay there.
If I was a producer this year, Iâ€™d try to do something like this:
BPVA presented by Lady Gaga (previous winner and A-list star).
SOTY presented by Beyonce (previous winner, A-list star and rumored performer of the Tina Turner tribute so she would already be there).
BNA presente by Samara Joy but joined by Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish.
AOTY presented by Adele (Universally adored A-list star, besides being a multi-time winner. They should BEG her.)
ROTY is the one I canâ€™t really think of someone ideal. Maybe Bruno Mars? Mariah? Perhaps even Lana, since sheâ€™s not nominated.
Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.

Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars would be perfect.

General Question,
I might be confusing this for another award, but if I remember correctly some of the categories are announced before the main ceremony at 8pm ET?
Is that correct? Does anyone know which categories are these? and at what time are they usually announced?
2x Academy Award Winner Sir Christopher Nolan
Carly Rae Jepsen just tweeted that she will present the award for Album of the Year so that she could slap Taylor Swiftâ€™s face for releasing her album on the same day and thus overshadowing Carlyâ€™s album. The Loneliest Time >>>> Midnights.
Honey, Best New Artist winners Christina Aguilera and Samara Joy should present that award (hopefully to Coco Jones ðŸ«°).

Christina is forever the Princess of Pop.
AOTY is presented by Kendrick Lamar, SZAâ€™s big brother/mentor type and Taylorâ€™s long time collaborator and friend.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.

The Pre-Show is where the winners of more than 80 categories are revealed, including non-mainstream genres, audiovisual field and music craft field.
Only the general field and some Pop, Rap, Country and R&B categories are usually announced during the ceremony.
The pre-show starts at 3:30 Eastern time I think.
It's me... Hi

 it would be nice billie/samara together
AOTY: AndrÃ© 3000 (won AOTY 20 years ago, current nominee); Adele would of course also be amazing lol
ROTY: Chris Martin (won ROTY 20 years ago); Bruno Mars also makes sense
SOTY: Lorde (won SOTY 10 years ago)
BNA: Would be cool to see Billie and Olivia or Dua together, but makes sense to have Samara Joy pass the torch
Pop Solo: Someone like Kelly Clarkson or Xtina
Pop Vocal Album: Of course Iâ€™d love to see Gaga, or Ariana!
Other potential presenters Iâ€™d love to see:
-Kacey Musgraves
-Missy Elliott
-Usher & Alicia Keys together
 is it confirmed? thatâ€™d be dope 
This is my hope but weâ€™ll see.

Christina forever.
