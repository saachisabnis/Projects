For some reason, there appears to be an intersection between those who love Hello Kitty and those who love Bruno Mars. Why else would Bruno be teaming up with the legendary cartoon creature for some special events this holiday season in Las Vegas?
Bruno is kicking off his holiday residency at Park MGM Las Vegas Dec. 18, and when fans arrive, they’ll find a whole new collection of themed, limited-edition merch featuring Hello Kitty and a cartoon Bruno. The items, including apparel, tote bags and water bottles, will be available through December.
In addition, the Hello Kitty Cafe at The Park MGM will be offering a Hello Kitty/Bruno Mars Cookie and a “Mars Mocha” brown sugar coffee drink. And on Dec. 18 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Hello Kitty will be doing a Bruno Mars-themed meet-and-greet at the cafe. The first 50 fans in line get a bag of exclusive Hello Kitty Cafe products.
Hello Kitty isn’t even the most unexpected collaboration of 2024 for Bruno. Nobody could have predicted that he and Lady Gaga would team up for a one-off duet, “Die With a Smile,” which has gone on to earn them two Grammy nominations. He also has a current hit with “APT.,” his collaboration with K-pop superstar Rosé.
