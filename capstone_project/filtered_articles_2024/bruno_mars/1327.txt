Series Creator and Artist Andrew Tarusov delivers this iconic feature image of one of our two leading ladies, Foxy, as she prepares to fight an army of the undead. Stay tuned for next month when our other leading lady, Roxy, gets her own feature cover image.
Pinupocalypse is a mix of 50's sci-fi and horror tropes reimagined with a clever twist. Set in 1950's small town America, this satirical adventure pits two stylish pin-up girls against hordes of zombies and aliens. Inspired by Hollywood filmmakers like Ed Wood, Sam Raimi and Edgar Wright, Pinupocalypse is an out-of-this-world story with a Gil Elvgren aesthetic to titillate readers!
It's Foxy's birthday, and with money in her pocket, she's on a mission to find the perfect dress! That is until an explosion rocks the small town of Pinupolis and startles her out of the dressing room. Surrounded by suspicious green smoke, Foxy emerges to find that everyone else in town has turned into zombies!

The Crow: Dead Time, one of the series best stories returns to print.
Set against the rugged backdrop of the late 1860s, Joshua, a man driven by a deep sense of justice, is left for dead by a ruthless band of renegade soldiers. As he lies dying, a mysterious crow appears, whispering a dark promise-that time is no barrier to vengeance.
Resurrected in the present day, Joshua finds himself in a world he barely recognizes, yet his mission remains the same: to exact retribution on those who wronged him. But the faces of his enemies have changed; the soldiers who once betrayed him now ride as a menacing biker gang that bears an uncanny resemblance to his old foes. With the crow as his guide and the weight of the past fueling his wrath, Joshua embarks on a relentless quest to bring justice to those who thought they had escaped their sins.

Riley has always been plagued by strange occurrences-things he can't explain to his teachers or family. His home, once nearly consumed by flames, now feels eerily empty of electronics, and Riley finds himself hearing the unspoken thoughts of those around him. Desperate for help, Riley's parents present what seems like a perfect solution: Dupont's School for Gifted Children.
Riley soon discovers he's not alone in his extraordinary abilities. His new friends share their own bizarre experiences that led them to Dupont's, but all reveal the same chilling truth: their powers have vanished since receiving their collars. As lessons become increasingly harsh and the director resorts to physical punishment, Riley and his friends are pushed to their limits.
In a high-stakes battle for freedom, Riley and his friends must outwit their captors and reclaim their identities in this gripping tale of courage and resistance.
