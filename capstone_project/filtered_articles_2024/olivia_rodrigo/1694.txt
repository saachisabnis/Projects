Crumbl cookies are worth trying once, maybe a few times, but is it actually the world’s best?
Cookies are great treats. They don’t require a fork like cake, can’t melt like ice cream and make drinking a glass of milk an even more delicious endeavor. Cookies also offer variety. For example, people can buy a pack of Oreos or make their own batch of chocolate chip at home. Or, for those who lack patience, cookie dough is practically just as good as the finished product.  



Not to mention, cookies hold cultural weight as well. They’re what keeps Santa motivated, thus keeping Christmas alive. They’re one of the best snacks I’ve received from a hotel after a day spent traveling. The smell of fresh cookies straight out of the oven is overwhelmingly nostalgic for plenty of people. So, if offered the chance to try the “world’s best chocolate chip cookie,” most people would understandably accept and expect something irresistibly good: a cookie with the perfect taste, texture and chocolate chip-to-dough ratio.  



Although Crumbl Cookies, the popular cookie-making company, makes this claim, both my grandma and I questioned its validity after we tried it for the first time. Since its creation in 2017, Crumbl Cookies has been on a steady incline. Being from the Cache Valley myself, I remember when the very first Crumbl store opened in Logan, Utah. From an outside perspective, not much has changed about the cookie company.  



Crumbl’s cookies were and still aren’t that cheap. They’re undoubtedly above average, but nowhere near the best I’ve had. In fact, my grandma and I agreed that the chocolate chip cookies she made on Sundays were just as good, if not better, than Crumbl’s. Though some things about Crumbl keep customers coming back for cookies time and time again. The quick service, fresh lineup of cookies each week and the pink box they’re packaged in all make Crumbl feel like they’re providing you with more than just a sweet treat—they’re providing you with an entire cookie experience.  
There’s no denying Crumbl’s success. At this point, a Crumbl store can be found in all 50 states. They brought in more than  $1 billion in sales in 2022. And they recently partnered with popstar and Gen Z icon Olivia Rodrigo to promote her own type of cookie. For those who enjoy stopping by Crumbl, by all means, don’t let me stop you from continuing your cookie consumption. If you have the cash to spare, spending it on cookies is completely fair.  



However, the bottom line is that Crumbl’s customers aren’t paying for the world’s best cookie. They’re paying for the pink box, the rotating menu and the experience of getting a pretty good cookie on demand. For those who haven’t had Crumbl Cookies yet, it’s definitely worth a try and perhaps a few visits after that. But is it worth frequenting? I don’t think so.
