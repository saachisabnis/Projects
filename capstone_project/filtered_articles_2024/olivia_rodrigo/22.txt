Olivia Rodrigo begins the second North American leg of her “GUTS: World Tour” next week (July 19), which means now’s the time to get your hands on last-minute tickets if you haven’t already.
The “get him back!” pop star has spent most of 2024 on the road, but like all good things, this tour must eventually come to an end. If you’re anything like me, you’ve been scrambling to find affordable tickets to her second North American leg ever since they went on sale in September last year. 
With the tour coming to an end in October, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s now or never if I ever hope to I ever hope to sing my heart out to songs like “vampire,” “obsessed,” “bad idea right?” and so many more live with Rodrigo herself.
Although tickets are completely sold out, I’ve combed through every resale site to find the cheapest tickets for every remaining show. Here’s what I found (before fees):
