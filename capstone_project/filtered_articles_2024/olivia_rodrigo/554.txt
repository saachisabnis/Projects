From edgy glam rock looks to classic Old Hollywood allure, online conversations have buzzed about the standout fashion moments of the evening, but one question has emerged: Who truly stole the spotlight?
To delve into this further, the experts at Dresscode analysed TikTok and Instagram metrics and utilised social engagement data to uncover the official best-dressed winners and nominees at the 2024 Grammy awards.

“The Grammy Awards remain the ultimate fusion of music and fashion, dazzling audiences worldwide both on and off the screen with an unparalleled display of red carpet glamour. From Taylor Swift’s Schiaparelli blend of edgy and elegant to Olivia Rodrigo’s timeless vintage Versace, each artist showcased their individual style, leaving an unforgettable imprint on the fashion landscape. 
“Miley Cyrus’s avant-garde Maison Margiela creation was one of the favourites of the night and boldly challenged conventional red carpet norms, solidifying her position as a trailblazer in haute couture. With every step down the red carpet, these artists not only celebrated their musical accomplishments but also demonstrated the transformative power of fashion.”
Taylor Swift is the best dressed Grammy winner in custom Schiaparelli. Taylor Swift stole the show at this year’s Grammy Awards, making history as the first performer to win the prize for Album of the Year four times. Dresscode can reveal that the star garnered the highest social engagement of all nominees—with 1,622,625—in her strapless white Schiaparelli gown, complete with a corset bodice and dramatic ruched skirt. Accessorising with simple peep toe sandals, long black gloves, layered necklaces and a watch choker, Swift exuded elegance on the red carpet. Swift’s look sparked the highest number of TikTok hashtags (4,625) and amassed over 1 million TikTok views for her red carpet walk, matching Olivia Rodrigo. Additionally, Swift’s ensemble received 248,000 likes, cementing its status as the most popular look of the night.
Olivia Rodrigo embodies old Hollywood glamour in vintage Versace. Securing the runner-up position is pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo, who stunned in vintage Versace, a piece that first captivated audiences when it graced the red carpet in 1995 on Lina Evangelista. Amassing a total social engagement of 1.3 million (1,351,700), the timeless strappy white gown adorned with pink and silver crystals evoked classic old Hollywood glamour, adding a touch of nostalgia to the evening’s fashion palette. Rodrigo’s graceful red carpet walk garnered 1.2 million TikTok views, while her outfit sparked 700 TikTok searches and garnered 66,000 Instagram likes—over two-fifths more likes than Miley Cyrus (45,000) who claimed the third spot.
Miley Cyrus wins her first Grammy in custom Maison Margiela. Miley Cyrus places third, boasting a total social engagement of 812,460. Despite the star’s multiple outfit changes throughout the night, it was her custom Maison Margiela Artisanal ensemble that truly captivated. Styled with gold velvet Tabi split-toe heels, this look seamlessly blends elements of 1920s flapper style with the regal aura of an Egyptian goddess, reportedly requiring 675 hours of meticulous work to craft. Cyrus’s Grammys look garnered more than 22,000 likes and 700,000 views on TikTok, solidifying its impact across audiences.
