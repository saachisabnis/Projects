Olivia Rodrigo's tour will wrap up on Aug. 17 in Los AngelesInvision
We have just been “happier” since Olivia Rodrigo started her “GUTS” world tour.
Since opening night of her world tour, fans of Rodrigo have been obsessed with coming up with “GUTS” themed friendship bracelets and outfits inspired by her hit songs.
Since videos of the high energy tour have been circulating TikTok, those who didn’t get tickets previously have been doing anything they can to get their hands on them.
This just means that all the remaining tickets are expected to fly off the secondary market websites.
So, if you are dying to Rodrigo in concert, make sure you snatch up tickets on StubHub, Vivid Seats, TicketCity and SeatGeek while you still can.
If you are struggling to find affordable tickets for some of Rodrigo’s upcoming shows, then we are here to help.
