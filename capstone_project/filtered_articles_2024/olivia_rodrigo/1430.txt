	Two pop stars are always better than one. And when those two comets are Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan, well, all bets are off. During Rodrigo’s tour stop at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, CA on Tuesday night (August 20), the “Bad Idea Right?” singer graciously shared the stage with Roan on the penultimate U.S. date on her Guts world tour.

	“I’ve known this next artists for about four years now… I absolutely adore her. I think she is one of the most singular, inspiring, powerful artists I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting, and I’m so excited because she’s gonna sing one of my favorite songs of all time with me tonight,” Rodrigo told the crowd before Roan joined her on stage, according to Variety. 

	










	Roan, who like Rodrigo was dressed in a brightly colored, sequin-dripping mini dress, then bounded out on stage to deafening screams from the audience as the two women hugged it out before getting to business. “We’re gonna sing a song, and we’re gonna teach you a dance,” Roan told them.

	That song, was, of course, Roan’s Billboard Hot 100 No. 17 sensation “Hot To Go!,” and while the crowd surely didn’t need the slowed-down tutorial on the energetic hand jive that has become the viral signature of the hit song, Roan and Rodrigo did a half-time walk-through before revving things up and high-kicking their way through the full speed version. Roan took the first verse, handing off to Rodrigo before they joined forces for the chorus, galloping in place while looking into each other’s faces. 

	Rodrigo also noted in her intro that Roan — who worked with Olivia’s go-to producer, Dan Nigro, on her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess — opened for her two years ago at a San Francisco date on Olivia’s debut tour, as well as doing the honors on a run of Guts world tour dates earlier this year. 

	After tonight’s (August 21) second show at Intuit Dome, Rodrigo’s tour jets off to Bangkok, where she will kick off a two-night stand at the IMPACT Arena on Sept. 15, before moving on to South Korean, China, Japan, Singapore and Australia, which will keep her on the road through an Oct. 22 date at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena.
