Rock Werchter has now unveiled three of its four 2025 headliners: pop wunderkind Olivia Rodrigo, indie icon Sam Fender, and punk legends Green Day. 
Due to take place from 3rd-6th July 2025 at Belgium’s Festivalpark Werchter, the festival’s next edition will welcome music heavyweights old and new for four days showcasing some of the very best names in contemporary pop and rock. 
Taking to the stage on Friday 4th July are Rock Werchter regulars Green Day (it’ll be their fourth time visiting the site), while Sam Fender - who’s been teasing much-anticipated new music and recently announced a last-minute UK and Ireland tour - will be the main event on Saturday 5th July. Closing the festival in style, meanwhile, is Olivia Rodrigo - the Grammy-nominated, chart-topping star who’ll be making Rock Werchter history as the festival’s youngest ever headliner. 
More names for next year’s festival will be revealed in due course, but in the meantime you can pre-register for tickets here before they go on general sale at 10am on Friday 22nd November from the festival’s website.
