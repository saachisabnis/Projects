For the past two years, Sony Electronics and 3x Grammy® winner Olivia Rodrigo have been crafting a partnership that speaks to Sony’s bigger mission — to create authentic music experiences that bring artists and fans closer, using the magic of personal audio technology. The initiative called “For The Music” and the Rodrigo/LinkBuds story is a perfect example of how these hands-on, multi-layered collaborations bring Sony’s mission to life.
At the center of this partnership are Sony’s LinkBuds – a series of noise canceling wireless earbuds designed to blend seamlessly into your life, whether you’re online or out in the world. Rodrigo is more than just the face of the campaign; she was deeply involved in the creative development process of the product from inception in early 2023.

Following a successful collaboration that year on Olivia Rodrigo x LinkBuds S, Sony and Rodrigo launched two more bespoke products in 2024.
Working closely with Sony and with the help of her producer, Dan Nigro, she helped create custom Olivia Rodrigo x LinkBuds Fit and LinkBuds Open models with her fans (aka ‘Livies’) at the top of mind. Her earbuds are tuned using custom EQ (equalizer) settings that provide an optimal sonic listening experience for her two chart-topping albums, SOUR and GUTS. And, of course, they come in Rodrigo’s signature color that’s become synonymous with her creative world: a vibrant violet that she’s loved since she was a kid, a color that she associates with magic, mystery, and the beauty of nature.
Sony went all-in on the partnership, launching a dynamic ad campaign — conceptualized with Rodrigo — that features her cruising the New York City subway (filmed at the New York Transit Museum). The campaign, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang, captures the energy and vibe of the city, while highlighting how LinkBuds fit into Rodrigo’s world and living in the Big Apple as a young person. They even partnered with the MTA, an iconic staple of the city, to release a limited-edition MetroCard featuring Rodrigo rocking her violet LinkBuds Fit — one of the last custom MetroCards ever, as the MTA goes contactless.

To top it off, Sony threw a unique VIP pop-up event for Rodrigo’s custom LinkBuds on December 3rd in New York City. They transformed a former subway station on the Lower East Side into a purple-hued wonderland, complete with immersive experiences and nods to the city’s well-known MTA system. Fans scored exclusive merch, got their portraits sketched by a subway artist, and even had tarot readings connecting fans to the iconic sashes in her “obsessed” music video. Rodrigo herself made an appearance, sharing her excitement about the partnership, and hosting a special meet and greet for a lucky group.
