Kylie Minogue stole the show at the 2024 BRIT Awards as she took to the stage after being presented with the Global Icon gong by Dua Lipa.
The Australian superstar, 55, closed the show with an energetic medley of her most famous hits with viewers rightly branding her a 'legend' after she last performed at the ceremony in 2008. 
She looked sensational as she flaunted her age-defying figure in a skimpy white bodysuit which boasted sheer panels.
Kylie arrived on stage in an oversized red coat before removing it to show off her sexy ensemble which she wore with knee-high black boots. 
She sang tracks from her back catalogue as the famous faces in the audience could be seen singing and dancing along.

The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
The perfomance came after the Kylie (R) had accepted the Global Icon gong from Dua Lipa (R)
Kylie was joined on stage by a slew of backing dancers

She had been nominated seven times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – but couldn’t possibly have won more than she did as she was shortlisted twice for song of the year – for Escapism, which won the title, and for Prada. 
As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
Dua Lipa picked up the fan-voted Pop Act gong, gushing to her fans: 'I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I'm standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me.'
