London festival series BST Hyde Park has announced that its latest 2025 headliner is Sabrina Carpenter - the ‘Short n’ Sweet’ star who’s emerged as one of contemporary pop’s best-loved names, thanks to her flirty, fun, hook-laden tracks. 
Due to take to the stage in the capital on Saturday 5th July 2025, Sabrina will also be joined by special guests Clairo (who released her superlative latest LP, ‘Charm’, in July) and current DIY cover star beabadoobee (who’s third album ‘This Is How Tomorrow Moves’ has seen her step up into indie-pop’s big leagues), with more names set to be confirmed in the new year. 
Also among BST Hyde Park’s varied roster of 2025 headliners are the unstoppable Olivia Rodrigo, ELO (for their last ever live show!), Zach Bryan, Hugh Jackman, and Noah Kahan, with more bill-topping names due to be unveiled soon.
Tickets for Sabrina’s night on the Great Oak Stage will go on general sale at 10am GMT next Wednesday, 11th December, here. You can check out the official poster and discover who else is set to perform on BST Hyde Park’s other days below.
