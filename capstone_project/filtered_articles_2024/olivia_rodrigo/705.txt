It has been a chaotic start for Manchester's newest arena. Co-op Live had been due to officially open at the end of April, but the grand opening has been pushed back multiple times after facing a number of work-related delays.
The Â£365m Eastlands venue was forced to apologise on Wednesday night (May 1) after fans of A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie were turned away at the door. It was later revealed the arena's first full show was cancelled minutes before it was due to start after part of an air conditioning unit fell from the gantry inside the venue prior to the start of the gig.
Just hours later, bosses announced that Friday and Saturday's Olivia Rodrigo gigs would also not be going ahead. It comes after The Black Keys and Peter Kay were forced to reschedule their gigs last week amid concerns from the emergency services.

A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie has said he will now perform at Manchester's AO arena on Saturday (May 4) following the cancellation of his Co-op Live date. But it still leaves a stacked list for the arena this May. So what is still going ahead?
We already know Olivia Rodrigo's two concerts on May 3 and 4 were axed amid the chaos on Wednesday evening. But no further announcements have been made as to the arena's other May gigs.
