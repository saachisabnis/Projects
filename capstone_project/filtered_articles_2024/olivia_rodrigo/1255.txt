THE NORTHLAND'S #1 HIT MUSIC MIX
We are less than a month away from Olivia Rodrigo's sold out show at the Xcel Energy Center, and with her appearance in Minnesota, some in the state will get a chance to try the new GUTS themed cookie from Crumbl.
The new "Olivia Rodrigo GUTS Cookie" will be available at select Crumbl locations in Minnesota between March 11th through March 18th, Rodrigo will bring her GUTS World Tour to St. Paul on March 15th.
The limited availability cookie comes as a cookie sandwich with a layer of triple-berry jam and vanilla buttercream between two purple cookies, the singer's signature color, with a star cutout and sprinkles around the edge of the cookie.
The unfortunate thing about this promotion is that only locations within one hour of her concert venue will get the special O-Rod cookies, that means the Duluth and other greater Minnesota locations won't get to try this cookie.
Here are the Minnesota locations that will have the cookie available the week of her show:
These are the only locations in Minnesota that will have the cookie on the weekly menu, so sorry Rochester, St. Cloud and Duluth, hopefully you have a "driver's license" and can make the trip to Twin Cities area to try out this cookie, and I say "Good 4 U" if that's what your plan is.
