Stationhead leverages Phenix’s real-time audio technology to stream custom, interactive artist and fan channels to over 15 million people around the world


Chicago, IL(10 Apr 2024)
                        

Phenix, the leading platform delivering scalable, real-time audio and video streaming, is providing the back-end technology for Stationhead, Gen-z's largest social music streaming service, to deliver custom fan channels for a number of major artists including Jennifer Lopez, Nikki Minaj, Olivia Rodrigo, Beyonce and Rhianna.  By leveraging Phenix’s real-time audio streaming technology, fans can listen to the best music from the most popular artists in the world, build communities around their favorite artists, and even interact directly with them in real-time. Interactive listening parties are the next generation of music consumption.
The Stationhead app syncs songs for every listener regardless of their music service, enables artists and fans to broadcast their own messaging, and permits each station to have up to 4 real-time audio participants. It is a place where fans can connect to listen to their favorite artists and where artists can mobilize their fans around new album releases to increase engagement, streams and sales. For example, Beyonce’s Beyhive channel on Stationhead accounted for over 15% of her first week sales for her #1 single, Texas Hold Em.
“Thanks to Phenix’s unique audio streaming technology, fans can listen to music, build community around shared interests, and interact with their favorite artists all in real-time. Stationhead has evolved the digital music experience to better empower the emotion, passion, and community that is core to fandom.” Ryan Star, Chief Executive Officer, Stationhead
Every second of the day, Phenix streams valuable music, sports, e-sports, and live content to millions of fans worldwide. Phenix enables Stationhead to deliver its audio stations with less than ½ second of end-to-end latency. By incorporating Phenix’s real-time streaming technology, running on best-in-class global infrastructure, Google Cloud, Stationhead gains a competitive advantage in the marketplace by offering fans access to the streams in real-time.
 “Working with Stationhead, one of the most unique apps in the marketplace, and seeing their growth from their early days as our second client until now, is a testament to their desire to become the future of social music listening. Attracting such artists as Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce proves that they have accomplished that goal.” Roy Reichbach, Chief Executive Officer, Phenix.
