 Olivia Rodrigo is now best friends with someone who doesn't need a driver's license to get around. 

 While visiting Melbourne, Australia, during her Guts World Tour, Rodrigo, 21, stopped by the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium, home of Pesto. The giant baby penguin has become a TikTok star thanks to his size and furry body.

 On Friday, Oct. 11, the “Get Him Back!” singer shared a clip from the aquarium on TikTok, set to audio from a sketch by Instagram star @BlameItOnKway. “Who are you?” Pesto asks. “I’m Pam, who are you,” Rodrigo replies, mouthing to the sketch. “I’m the owner of this house,” Pesto says as the clip cuts back to the penguin.

 “Thanks for the visit Olivia! Pesto loved meeting another super fan 🐧 Good luck with the rest of your Melbourne shows!” Sea Life Melbourne replied to Rodrigo’s post.

 Rodrigo also shared two pictures from her visit on her Instagram Stories. She was dressed for the cool temps inside the aquarium’s penguin enclosure.

 Pesto is a 10-month-old king penguin and weighs about 46 pounds, according to Sea Life Melbourne’s website. He is the largest chick the aquarium has ever seen and is even larger than his parents. His biological father, Blake, is the aquarium’s biggest adult and oldest penguin. 

 The penguin is likely to lose weight when he fledges, or when he develops adult feathers. His keepers predict he will weigh around 33 pounds during the process, reports the Associated Press.

 “He’s going to start losing that really adorable baby fluff,” Sea Life Melbourne education supervisor Jacinta Early told the AP in September. “It might take him one to two months to really get rid of it. Then he’ll be nice and sleek and streamlined.”

 “Pesto has reached more than 1.9 billion people across the globe, so he really is a draw card for visitation to Victoria,” Sea Life Melbourne senior keeper Michaela Smale told 9News in September.

 Despite his age, Pesto’s keepers didn’t know he was a boy until last month. King penguins are non-sexually dimorphic, so they do not have visible traits to allow keepers to distinguish their sex. They needed a blood sample to discover Pesto is male. The gender reveal video logged over 1.7 million views on TikTok.

 Rodrigo began a four-night stand at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena on Oct. 9. On Oct. 17, she will start another four-night stand, this time at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney. Her Guts World Tour will continue with a group of dates in South America in March.
