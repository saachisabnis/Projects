If you don‚Äôt want to feel ‚ÄúSour‚Äù about missing out on seeing Olivia Rodrigo during the second leg of her tour, then we suggest looking into buying tickets.
But similarly to what we saw with Rodrigo‚Äôs ‚ÄúSour‚Äù tour, tickets are continuing to fly off the market, if they haven‚Äôt sold-out entirely already.
As ticket demand is high for this tour, it is important to snatch them up while they are still available.
You can also purchase tickets on secondary market websites, such as StubHub, Vivid Seats, TicketCity and SeatGeek.
If you find that you never secure the tickets at the best cost or in the section you want to be in through StubHub, you can find some tips and tricks here.
First-time Vivid Seats users can save $20 on ticket orders over $200 by entering promo code NJ20 at checkout.
