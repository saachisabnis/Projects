If you’d like to purchase one of the limited edition Stanley cups inspired by Olivia Rodrigo’s album Guts, too effing bad. You missed it. It’s over.
The collab between the hottest Gen Z rock star and the best-selling drinkware brand was announced on July 2 in an Instagram post showing the “vampire” singer sipping from the item midshow. It’s a lilac “quencher” cup with the “OR” brand logo and stars reminiscent of the confetti from the Guts tour.
It’s definitely cute! The brand describes the color of the straw as “grape.” It holds 40 ounces and costs $55. This account somehow knew about it in February.

But you couldn’t just buy one. No, this cup was available through an “EQL Launch,” a concept I’m still wrapping my ancient millennial mind around but seems to be like a lottery where you sign up during the “launch window” to purchase an item, and at the end of the window (which in this case opened July 9 and closed July 10), you find out if you’re getting to buy one.
So resellers can’t scoop ’em all up and you don’t have to be the very, very first person in line to have a shot. I think.
Now, people who were lucky enough to be selected to purchase the item are celebrating their good fortune. Very clever, making people feel like they won something for getting to spend money on your product. Nicely done, capitalism.

Obviously, the page crashed when the launch kicked off, but eventually people got to sign up, as you can see here:

This gal managed to get her hands on one early, straight from the brand. Unclear who she is or how this Stanley-centric account got ahold of her video, but she does look quite happy!

If you missed the window or weren’t selected, I have amazing news for you: You can make this. You can totally make this. Here’s what you will need:
A purple Stanley cup.
Star stickers.
A logo sticker.
That is it. Have fun and stay hydrated, Olivia Rodrigo fans!
