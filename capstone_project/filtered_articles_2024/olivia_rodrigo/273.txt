Olivia Rodrigo's tour will wrap up on Aug. 17 in Los Angeles.Matt Smith | For NJ Advance Media
Olivia Rodrigo has just started her world tour, and we couldn’t wait any longer to spill our “GUTS” about it.
From flying over the crowd on a moon, the outfits and the choreography, the “GUTS” world tour just might be one of the best tours of the year.
However, this just means that all the remaining tickets are expected to fly off the secondary market websites.
So, if you are dying to Rodrigo in concert, make sure you snatch up tickets on StubHub, Vivid Seats, TicketCity and SeatGeek while you still can.
