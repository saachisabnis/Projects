Prague/Washington - Portraits of Alsu Kurmasheva are scattered throughout the Prague apartment she shares with her husband and two daughters. But the journalist has not set foot here in more than a year.
Perhaps the most striking of the paintings, all of which were done by her husband, Pavel Butorin, is the one that remains unfinished, perched on an easel in the living room. Butorin started it after Kurmasheva, 47, was jailed in Russia in October 2023 on charges that are widely viewed as baseless and politically motivated.
Painting, Butorin says, is just one way he has tried to cope with his wife's absence.
'Even to say, 'We miss Alsu,' doesn't quite convey the emotion that we go through,' Butorin told VOA at the family's home. 'I get up, and the first thing in my head is Alsu. I've just been really unable to escape this.'
With their lives intertwined - from raising their daughters Bibi and Miriam, to working at the same news network - he is never far from reminders that his wife is 1,700 miles away, in a prison in the city of Kazan.
'In the evening, we sit at this table. We see an empty chair,' Butorin said, his eyes fixed on the seat at the large, wooden table, as if he were willing his wife to appear. 'It signifies a broken family, a family torn apart by an unjust, merciless, heartless regime.'
      Russia convicts 2nd American journalist in secret trial  
When Butorin spoke with VOA in Prague in July, his wife - who has dual U.S.-Russian citizenship - was approaching nine months in custody. Less than one week later, on July 19, she was convicted behind closed doors of spreading what Moscow says is false information about its military and sentenced to six and a half years in prison.
On the same day, about 450 miles east, in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia, a secret Russian court convicted American journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years behind bars.
The U.S. government has called for the immediate release of both journalists. Press freedom groups, meanwhile, have condemned the trials as shams and said the cases underscore how Moscow's war in Ukraine means American journalists are at a heightened risk of being used as political pawns by the Kremlin.
Kurmasheva and Gershkovich count themselves among the 22 journalists jailed in Russia at the end of 2023, more than half of whom are foreign nationals, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Russia's Foreign Ministry and embassy in Washington did not reply to VOA's emails requesting comment for this story.
Despite the international condemnation, Butorin has largely shouldered the responsibility of advocating for Kurmasheva's release by himself. For months, he has found himself balancing the roles of father, journalist and advocate as he shuttles between Prague and Washington.
Hostage experts say his experience is common for American families who have a loved one held hostage or unjustly detained.
A decade ago, Diane Foley was one of them as she tried to navigate complex bureaucracy and conflicting information when Islamic State militants kidnapped and later killed her son, American journalist James Foley, in 2014.
Her experience led her to establish the Foley Foundation, which supports families and advocates for Americans unjustly jailed abroad.
'A lot of families don't have any idea how to contact media or get their story heard, how to contact their congressman, how to get their voices heard through the bureaucracy. So we seek to help them navigate that,' she told VOA during one of her regular trips to Washington.
The U.S. government has made progress in these policy areas, she says. But so much more still needs to be done.
A longtime journalist at the Tatar-Bashkir Service of VOA's sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, Kurmasheva had planned only a brief visit to Russia to care for her ailing mother.
Her desk at work remains relatively untouched. Business cards are still spread out on the table. And the calendar - still set to May 2023 - shows where she underlined in black ink the dates of the ill-fated trip.
In the weeks following Kurmasheva's jailing, her colleague Ramazan Alpaut said he still turned around at his desk, half-expecting to see Kurmasheva sitting behind him.
'We miss her here as a person and as a colleague,' he told VOA.
Kurmasheva's arrest came as a shock for the team, and a warning that travel to see family in Russia is no longer an option.
That fact, says Tatar-Bashkir Service chief Rim Gilfanov, crystallizes an already difficult reality for exiled Russians grappling with the fallout of the war in Ukraine.
But more immediately, he says, he just wants a key member of his team back.
'Alsu is our veteran journalist,' Gilfanov says. 'The main quality that comes to my mind when I think of Alsu is constant eagerness and preparedness to help everyone.'
Authoritarian regimes have long targeted RFE/RL and its journalists. Russia has designated the outlet a foreign agent and an undesirable organization. And Kurmasheva is one of four of its journalists currently in prison, including two in Belarus and one in Russian-occupied Crimea.
'It's a grim reality that starts to set in that we are targets,' RFE/RL president and CEO Stephen Capus told VOA. 'They're trying to make the pursuit of journalism a crime.'
'They are taking me to the investigative committee right now.'
Butorin was at work when he got this distressed voice message from his wife. It was October 18, 2023, and agents dressed in black and wearing balaclavas had arrived at the home of Kurmasheva's mother to arrest the journalist.
The next time he heard his wife's voice was in April 2024, when she spoke to reporters from a glass defendant's box about the poor prison conditions she was experiencing.
'We love to hear her voice. But it's also painful to see her in a glass cage,' Butorin said.
Butorin, director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language television and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA, was at work when he listened to the message.
      American RFE/RL reporter marks 6 months jailed in Russia  
His office is now part shrine, filled with photos and posters and newspaper articles about his wife. On the whiteboard, Free Alsu magnets depict a cartoon of her face. Butorin drew the image for Kurmasheva's Gmail profile picture, he said. Now it's on magnets and buttons - like the one pinned to the lapel of his dark blue suit jacket this July afternoon.
In a corner, next to a Lego diorama of the set of the TV show 'Seinfeld' - a series the family loves to watch - is a stack of copies of No to War. The book, which Kurmasheva helped edit, features stories of 40 Russians who opposed Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Pro-Russian media have reported that Kurmasheva's arrest is linked to that book. But to date, authorities have failed to publicly provide evidence to substantiate its charges against her.
'It's a harmless little book,' Butorin said. 'It just reminds me how incredibly arbitrary this detention is.'
  Wearing a #Free Alsu T-shirt, Pavel Butorin pauses in Prague's Old Town on a morning run, July 10, 2024. The Current Time journalist says he never stops thinking about his wife, and how she is coping in prison in Russia.
Butorin has spent an unknown number of hours thinking about his wife's captors. Are they evil personified? Or, Ã  la Hannah Arendt and the banality of evil, are they just bureaucrats 'thoughtlessly' doing their jobs?
The answer likely lies somewhere in the middle, he recognizes, but Butorin still finds himself wondering whether the judges and prosecutors once listened to her deep voice on the radio, back when she hosted a show for audiences in Tatarstan.
Kurmasheva's long absence has been marked by bittersweet birthdays and holidays, more media interviews than Butorin can count, and five trips to Washington to press lawmakers and U.S. government officials to do more for his wife.
In his office, just a few days before he departs for one of those trips, he admits that, like many journalists, he prefers to be behind the camera instead of being the story.
But that preference for privacy is no more.
'I fear if I don't keep this story in the news, and if I don't keep Alsu's story alive, that U.S. policymakers, members of the administration, of any administration, will just start forgetting about her,' Butorin said. 'I see a problem there.'
Butorin, who is also a U.S. citizen, is quick to voice appreciation for the support officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have offered. It turns out that press freedom is one of the few issues that Democrats and Republicans can agree on.
But the trips to the American capital are also stained with frustration.
Requests to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been denied, Butorin said. (Blinken also serves as an ex officio member of the board that oversees the entities under the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including RFE/RL and VOA.) To date, the highest-ranking official Butorin has met with is Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter.
Feeling optimistic can be difficult, Butorin said, when, in meeting after meeting, the same officials regurgitate the same talking points and offer little concrete information.
'Sometimes I walk out with a sense of desperation, and sometimes I find these meetings very unsatisfactory,' he says.
It's a problem familiar to Diane Foley.
When Islamic State militants kidnapped her son in 2012, she says, the process was even more opaque.
'Our government doesn't seem to trust these desperate families, who want their loved one back, with what information they have,' she said.
To Foley, 'an undue burden' is still placed on families to fight for the U.S. government's attention.
'It's all on the family in the U.S. That hasn't changed a whole lot,' she said. 'It was all on me, all on our family, when Jim was taken - all on us to figure it out. And now it's still all on the family.'
Foley and her foundation are helping Butorin navigate the process, including by working behind the scenes to push the State Department.
In that time, she has grown close to the couple's daughters. 'When I see Bibi and Miriam, God bless them. They shouldn't, as teenagers, be dealing with this,' she said.
In late July, she and Butorin took part in a Foley Foundation event in the Capitol Building, to mark the release of its annual report on U.S. hostage policy. The foundation counts 46 Americans held hostage or unjustly detained around the world.
At the panel, Dustin Stewart, the deputy special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, spoke about the support the government offers.
Butorin rebutted that because Kurmasheva has not been declared wrongfully detained, his family is not receiving any of that support.
At the panel, Stewart told VOA, 'On the process, I'll just say, it's ongoing.'
The designation opens up extra resources and support for families and commits the government to secure their release.
It is the biggest difference between the cases of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich, the other American journalist jailed in Russia. In the latter case, the United States declared The Wall Street Journal reporter wrongfully detained within two weeks of his arrest. Press freedom groups have criticized the State Department for not declaring Kurmasheva wrongfully detained, too.
When pressed as to if and when Kurmasheva will be designated, the State Department has on several occasions sent VOA identical or nearly identical statements that say the Department 'continuously reviews the circumstances' of Americans detained overseas to determine if they are wrongful. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, has denied VOA's multiple requests for an interview about Kurmasheva's case.
      False Espionage Charge a 'Tough Situation,' Says Former Jailed Journalist  
To cope, Butorin says compartmentalizing has become a necessary strategy.
'It may come across as a little disingenuous, but you do have to treat all these little areas of your life as projects,' he said. Those 'projects' range from calling on Blinken to declare his wife wrongfully detained to dealing with the 'Kafkaesque bureaucracy' of the Czech postal system that prevents him from collecting his wife's mail.
In public events and interviews, Butorin leans toward the stoic, which he notes is unlike Kurmasheva, who can go into a room and 'walk away with five or 10 new friends.'
'Some people may think that I lack emotion,' Butorin said. 'But it's all a front. I'm hurting on the inside.'
It's when Butorin is by himself that he says he feels the most pain. 'When the girls go to bed, I usually go to bed soon, too,' Butorin said, 'so I'm not left alone with my thoughts.'
And when he is with the couple's daughters, there are glimpses of the joy and the humor the family still manages to share.
  After several days of media interviews and advocacy meetings in Washington, Pavel Butorin, right, and his daughters, 12-year-old Miriam, left, and 16-year-old Bibi, center, sit outside the Capitol on July 25, 2024.
After an interview in Washington, Butorin excitedly showed videos from an Olivia Rodrigo concert he attended with his daughters. Nearby, Bibi, 16, and Miriam, 12, were writing postcards to friends in Prague. Butorin made fun of one of them for how she wrote the number seven.
'You cross your sevens? That's un-American,' he said with a smirk, provoking laughter from both girls.
When Kurmasheva eventually returns, Butorin quipped that she will find their daughters taller than she is. 'But more importantly, she will see very strong young women who have had to grow up really quickly,' he said.
Sometimes, when Butorin sees videos or photos of his wife in court, he finds himself wondering whether she's still the same person. In any case, he and his daughters aren't.
'It's hurting my family a lot that my mom isn't here with us,' Bibi said. 'It's been so long already, and we just don't want to get used to our mom not being here, because we're getting close to that, unfortunately.'
Back in the family's Prague apartment, the teenager alternates between talking about Taylor Swift and calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release her mother. On the wall opposite her, an abstract painting by her father depicts Kurmasheva pregnant with Bibi.
'At the dinner table, I always feel like there's something missing because she's not there. And it's weird having to cook for one less person. And it's weird being in the car with one less person. And it's weird, because we were always a family of four. And now there's one of us missing,' Bibi said.
  Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Alsu Kurmasheva, who is in custody after she was accused of violating Russia's law on foreign agents, listens to her lawyer Edgar Matevosyan during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia, April 1, 2024.
Butorin doesn't like to dwell on the past, and by that he primarily means Kurmasheva's decision to travel to Russia in the first place. They were both well aware of the risks, he said.
She had traveled there without incident in 2022. But the day she left in 2023, he recalls Kurmasheva saying to him, 'Tell me everything will be OK.'
Some days, Butorin wishes he hadn't let her go. But then, Kurmasheva wouldn't be Kurmasheva if she hadn't gone.
'She is known as a selfless friend,' Butorin said. 'That empathy and her responsibility as a devoted daughter, that was what really drove her to go to Russia.'
Bibi agreed. 'She pays attention to every single person around her, and she's really willing to give up so many things about her and her life to help others.'
As the family waits for any progress in her case, Butorin channels his wife's unselfishness and his daughters' resiliency.
'I don't have the luxury of just falling apart. Honestly, that's not an option for me,' Butorin said. 'It's just something that we have to live with. I think I'm a fairly unremarkable person. It's just something that a father - any father - I think would do.'
