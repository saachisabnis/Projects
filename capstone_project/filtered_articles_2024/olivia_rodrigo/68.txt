	Rodrigo and Partridge first sparked romance rumors back in October when they were seen spending time together in London, walking seemingly with their arms wrapped around each other’s waist. The Enola Holmes star was also seen supporting the “Get Him Back!” singer at iHeartRadio’s Jingle Ball in New York City on Dec. 8, and again one day later when she served as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live.

	Rodrigo’s Guts deluxe track, “So American,” is rumored to be about the actor, as she sings in the chorus: “I’d go anywhere he goes/ And he says I’m so American/ Oh God, I’m gonna marry him/ If he keeps this s–t up/ I might just be in love.”

	The Asian leg of the Guts World Tour kicks off Sept. 16 in Bangkok, Thailand, and will find Rodrigo traveling through Seoul, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Soon afterward, Rodrigo will play two shows in Melbourne followed by two in Sydney in October. She’ll be joined for all four Australian shows by rising alt-pop star Benee.
