Olivia Rodrigo‘s Guts got a second wind Friday (March 22) with the release of her sophomore album’s deluxe edition featuring five additional tracks: “Obsessed,” “Stranger,” “Girl I’ve Always Been,” “Scared of My Guitar” and “So American.” 

	And though she says she’s “so proud” of all the new tunes, she did reveal on Instagram that one of them is definitely her favorite.

	“GUTS (spilled) is out!!!!!” the pop star wrote, sharing photos from the “Obsessed” music video, which dropped just a few hours ahead of the deluxe album. “I made obsessed with @dan_nigro and @st_vincent almost 3 years ago (🤯) and I’m so stoked it’s finally out in the world. it’s always been one of my favorites and it’s been so fun to play live every night on tour.” 

	










	“I’m so proud of the songs stranger, girl I’ve always been, and scared of my guitar as well and especialllyyy excited about so american,” she added. “hope you guys dig!!!!!! the GUTS have been spilled!!!!”

	The “Drivers License” singer also posted a screenshot of “So American” on her Story and confirmed, “this one is my fav,” adding three winking emojis. 

	Why the winks? Fans have already come to the conclusion that “So American” is a love song about Rodrigo’s rumored boyfriend, English actor Louis Partridge. “I’d go anywhere he goes/ And he says I’m so American,” she sings on the track. “Oh God, I’m gonna marry him/ If he keeps this s–t up/ I might just be in love.”

	The Grammy winner first confirmed that the Guts deluxe edition was coming at her Chicago Guts World Tour show, where she held up a piece of paper bearing the news during “Get Him Back!” Her backup dancers also held up signs displaying the titles on the extended tracklist.

	Released in September, the original Guts set features 12 tracks, including the Billboard Hot 100-topping “Vampire.” The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
