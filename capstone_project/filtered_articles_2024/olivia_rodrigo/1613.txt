"Wow. Sometimes, there's just a hole in the stage. That's alright!"
Olivia Rodrigo fell through a hole on stage during her recent concert in Melbourne.
The pop star was performing on Monday (October 14) at the final of four shows in the city.
Footage shared on social media shows Rodrigo running across the stage to greet fans before being dramatically interrupted after falling through an opening that seemed to be obscured by darkness.
Fans can be heard gasping in the clip, but Rodrigo promptly climbed out of the hole and continued with the show. “Oh my God, that was fun! I’m okay!” she told the crowd. “Wow. Sometimes, there’s just a hole in the stage. That’s alright! Alright, where was I?”
It seems Rodrigo has since found the humour in the fall. Shortly after the show she took to TikTok to re-share the clip, writing “I am ok hahaha❤️” in the comments.

Monday’s show was the last in Melbourne before the ‘Brutal’ singer heads to Sydney, where she will perform on October 17, 18, 21 and 22. Visit here for a full list of tour dates.
Rodrigo’s current tour is in support of her second album ‘Guts’, which was released in September last year. NME gave ‘Guts’ five stars, saying, “The 20-year-old’s self-assured second album documents her hopes, fears and trauma with thrilling emotional candour. ‘Guts’ doesn’t just feel transitional in a musical sense. It marks the end of Rodrigo’s teenage years, a moment that has gravity given that she recently said in a statement that she felt like she grew ‘10 years’ between the ages of 18 and 20′.”
Last week, she donated all of the profits from her first show in the Philippines to the nonprofit Jhpiego which works “to ensure moms and babies receive quality health care” (as per their website).
Earlier this year, the ‘Get Him Back!’ singer made headlines for handing out contraceptive kits with condoms, Plan Bs, and information for abortion access at her show in Missouri. The state notably banned almost all abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. The kits were part of a reproductive rights initiative held on her tour, in which the National Network of Abortion Funds would have a booth at every show on her North American leg.
In other news, Rodrigo has announced new dates for her rescheduled Manchester shows, and they’re just after Glastonbury 2025.
The singer shared that she’ll be playing Manchester’s Co-op Live arena on June 30 and July 1 next year, and tickets purchased for the original shows will be transferred to the new dates automatically.
