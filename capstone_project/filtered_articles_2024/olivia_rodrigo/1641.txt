When Olivia Rodrigo stops in Philadelphia, PA this summer, her brand new cookie with Crumbl will follow her.
Rodrigo's 2024 tour, in support of her sophomore studio album GUTS, is easily the most anticipated tour of the year.
The trek is worthy of a tasty collaboration!
But unlike Olivia's debut album Sour, the project that made her a superstar and a Best New Artist Grammy Award winner, her new Crumbl cookie is on the sweeter side.
The GUTS cookie is actually more of a cookie sandwich and it LOOKS just as feisty and in-your-face as Rodrigo's music.
It's triple berry jam and light vanilla buttercream nestled between two chilled vanilla-flavored purple cookies (featuring a star design). Then, the whole thing is rolled in colorful sprinkles.
Can't you just taste it now?

To get your hands on a limited-edition GUTS cookie, visit Philly-area Crumbl locations the week of Olivia Rodrigo's tour stop at Wells Fargo Center on July 19, 2024.
That means you can find it at Crumbl Cookie stores in Philadelphia and in South Jersey, including Cherry Hill, Deptford, Turnersville, and Mays Landing.
Once Rodrigo's GUTS Tour wraps up this August, Crumbl will make her cookie available at all locations in the U.S. and Canada between August 19th and August 24th.
