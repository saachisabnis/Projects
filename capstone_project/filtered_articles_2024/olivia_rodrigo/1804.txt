Pittsburgh’s concert season is starting to pick up steam, with the year’s first Pavilion at Star Lake show, which has been been sold out for months. Other highlights include a sold-out three night stand by a quirky alternative rock band, as well as the first arena show for a rising metal band (also sold out).

Top concerts
May 9-11: They Might Be Giants at Mr. Smalls Theatre
They Might Be Giants will be highlighting different albums from their 42-year career on their upcoming Midwest tour, which opens with three nights in Pittsburgh.

Their tour hits eight cities — with 11 of 15 shows already sold out — for the band known for songs like “Birdhouse in Your Soul,” “Istanbul (Not Constantinople)” and the theme from “Malcolm in the Middle.”

“We’ve expanded to an eight-piece band. There’s a whole set of repertoire that we’ve put together with the horns,” John Flansburgh told the Milwaukee Record. “It really is a very big show with a lot of different kinds of musical approaches. There’s repertoire we never could have done in the past, and it’s very effective now.

May 19: Sleep Token, Empire State Bastard at Petersen Events Center
The masked members of alt metal group Sleep Token have managed to maintain their anonymity while taking the music world by storm.

With new costumes that debuted late last year to symbolize a new era, the genre-bending metal band’s “Take Me Back to Eden” was named best album by Metal Hammer, Revolver and Rock Sound.

The band’s mythology involved a deity named “Sleep,” with the band’s frontman Vessel, the creator of most of the band’s music. With only two interviews since the band’s formation, not much insight into the band exists beyond pre-recorded stage banter.

“They need to be able to project themselves onto this, without anyone else’s identity getting in the way,” Vessel told a 2023 crowd. “In turn, I need to be able to show my true self to them in a way that does not compromise their ability to connect.”

May 29: Noah Kahan at the Pavilion at Star Lake
Singer-songwriter Noah Kahan is opening the season at the Pavilion at Star Lake.

Kahan, who was nominated for Best New Artist at the 2024 Grammys, rose to fame with 2022’s “Stick Season.” His recent high-profile appearances, include concerts with Olivia Rodrigo and a stop on “Sesame Street.” Through it all, he’s been open about his mental health.

“That’s my fundamental struggle with antidepressants,” Kahan told Tom Power in an interview. “A lot of times I feel like the battle is trying to be creative versus being happy. Would I rather be happy and a little numb or really depressed and creative, but not happy at all?”

May 19: Sleep Token, Empire State Bastard at Petersen Events Center
The masked members of alt metal group Sleep Token have managed to maintain their anonymity while taking the music world by storm.

With new costumes that debuted late last year to symbolize a new era, the genre-bending metal band’s “Take Me Back to Eden” was named best album by Metal Hammer, Revolver and Rock Sound.

The band’s mythology involved a deity named “Sleep,” with the band’s frontman Vessel, the creator of most of the band’s music. With only two interviews since the band’s formation, not much insight into the band exists beyond pre-recorded stage banter.

“They need to be able to project themselves onto this, without anyone else’s identity getting in the way,” Vessel told a 2023 crowd. “In turn, I need to be able to show my true self to them in a way that does not compromise their ability to connect.”

“That’s my fundamental struggle with antidepressants,” Kahan told Tom Power in an interview. “A lot of times I feel like the battle is trying to be creative versus being happy. Would I rather be happy and a little numb or really depressed and creative, but not happy at all?”
