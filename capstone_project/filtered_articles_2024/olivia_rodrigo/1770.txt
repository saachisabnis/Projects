Olivia Rodrigo shared a behind-the-scenes look of her life on the Guts World Tour, following her recent shows in Boston, Massachusetts and across Canada.
In a new Instagram post, the Driver's License hitmaker, 21, shared a slideshow full of fun memories over the past few weeks, including a shot of her cutting loose with a glass of wine. 
'I’m here, I’m there, I’m everywhere,' she captioned the photo dump, which included various artsy shots in different arenas and a snap with indie singer Chappell Roan, who performed her final opening set at Rodrigo’s show on Monday.
Another picture showed the Grammy winner lounging in a red cowboy hat, which read 'all-canadian b**ch' in lowercase letters, a nod to her track all-american b**ch.

Previously, she has dated her High School Musical: The Musical: The Series costar Joshua Bassett, music exec Zack Bia, Adam Faze, Ethan Wacker.  
In 2023, she told The Guardian, 'I never want to say who my songs are about... I've never done that before in my career and probably won’t.'
She added: 'I think it’s better to not pigeonhole a song to being about this one thing.'
The deluxe edition release of Guts beat out other exciting drops from the likes of Cardi B, Shakira, Future, Metro Boomin, and others on iTunes.

A sonically diverse pop album with energetic songs and soft ballads, Guts as a whole experiments with rock influences more than her debut studio release. 
Vampire served as the first single off of Guts back on June 30, 2023, and shot right to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, marking her third number one song.
The second single, Bad Idea Right? would drop in August and reach the top 10 in Australia, the US, and UK, which was followed by the third single, Get Him Back! in September, peaking within the top 10 on the Billboard Global 200 chart.
To date, Guts has topped album charts in 15 countries, including the U.S., Australia, Germany, Sweden, and the UK.

In February, the opening night of her Guts World Tour in Palm Springs, she revealed how she celebrated her 21st birthday. 
'I went to the gas station the other day and bought a pack of cigarettes and a six pack of beer,' she said during her show, part of which was shared via fan on TikTok. 
However, the hitmaker clarified that she didn't 'consume' her purchases: 'I promise I didn't consume it, but I just bought it because I f*****g could.' 
The star then reassured her fans that growing up was not scary: 'Anyway, all this to say that I think growing up isn’t so scary after all and life just kind of gets better at the end.'
