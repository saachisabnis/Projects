Nicki Minaj is reportedly ‘in pieces’ after her Co-op Live Arena show was postponed after she was arrested in the Netherlands.
Disappointed fans watched as the Pink Friday rapper took to Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena stage last night, after she failed to perform in Manchester.
Fans were let into the plagued venue on Saturday evening (May 25) despite the 41-year-old US singer and rapper being detained at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on accusations of carrying marijuana.
She vented her frustration on social media, claiming to have been sat in jail for over five hours as her flight was delayed over the drug dispute.
‘Nicki is in pieces and knows her fans have badly been let down,’ an insider told The Sun after the initial shock died down.
They added she understands fans spent a lot of money to see her so is working ‘non-stop’ to get the show rescheduled.
This could prove difficult as Co-Op Live already has numerous gigs needing rearranging after its disastrous launch saw Take That, Olivia Rodrigo and The Black Keys postponing.
‘Nicki understands why they are upset and she is so determined to make it up to them,’ the source continued.
‘She likes to speak to her fans on a personal level. Nicki wants to make it right.’
The Superbass rapper documented her initial response to the arrest on social media, with conflicting opinions from fans.
On X, Nicki wrote: ‘Thank you to everyone who prayed for me today. May God cover you and all that is connected to you. May you be blessed beyond your imagination.
‘Barbz, I’m @ the stock exchange hotel in #Manchester I arrived a little over an hour ago.
‘After sitting in a jail cell for 5-6 hours, my plane still didn’t take off for another 20 mins once I boarded. The flight was 50 mins. 50 mins.
‘That’s why they had to do the big song and dance b/c they knew I’d still find a way to perform even if it came down to my last 90 mins in the building which would have been until 1130pm. The building was willing to go past 11pm. So grateful to them for that.
‘So they succeeded at their plan to not let me get on that stage tonight. I succeeded @ getting to the root of it all by recording them and posting everything in real time. I have sooooooooo much video evidence. You wouldn’t believe it if I told you.
‘I’ll have the lawyers and GOD take it from here tho.’
Thank you to everyone who prayed for me today. May God cover you & all that is connected to you. May you be blessed beyond your imagination.  Barbz, Iâm @ the stock exchange hotel in #Manchester I arrived a little over an hour ago.After sitting in a jail cell for 5-6 hours, myâ¦
The rap star also suggested that she’s been deliberately targeted by the police: ‘Please please please accept my deepest and most sincere apologies.
‘They sure did know exactly how to hurt me today but this too, shall pass.
‘They’ve been doing this over and over and over and over and over again and I’ve tried so hard to not discuss it b/c you guys deserve to just get the good stuff. I hate involving you in anything that isn’t for entertainment purposes only.’
In order to still see her fans, Nicki encouraged those who were not already at home to come to her hotel.
‘Barbz, I’m going on the balcony so if you’re outside I’ll be able to see you & I may come downstairs. I’ll be out there for about an hour. Rlly wanted to at least get to see you. But if you’re in bed plz STAY THERE,’ she wrote.
To my #GagCityManchester Barbz, Iâm going on the balcony so if youâre outside Iâll be able to see you & I may come downstairs. Iâll be out there for about an hour. Rlly wanted to at least get to see you. But if youâre in bed plz STAY THERE. Iâll update you guys tmrw. Love you
An announcement was made inside the venue on May 25 and ticket holders were told to make their way to the exits, and some videos captured the concert-goers’ reactions. As a tannoy shared the disappointing news, fans looked visibly shocked, while one person remarked: ‘I told you’ to her friends.
Fans were instructed to keep hold of their tickets for the rescheduled performance, as Live Nation has confirmed the gig will be moved to a later date.
A statement also said: ‘Despite Nicki’s best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight’s show happen, the events of today have made it impossible.
‘We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused.’

Speaking to the PA news agency following the announcement, fans said they were unsure if they would be able to make the next gig.
Frankie Harper, 20, from Andover, Hampshire, said: ‘(I’m) distraught, to say the least. It definitely hurts more that it was on my birthday. Not sure what happens with the £100s that you spend on a train and hotel.’
Nord Herida, 23, who lives in Barnsley and travelled an hour to attend the concert, said he had felt before the postponement that his time was ‘being wasted’ inside the arena.
He added that his friend had travelled four hours from Ipswich to get to the gig and that they had been waiting since 1pm at the arena.
‘(I’m) p***ed not (going to) lie, they have taken this long to tell us,’ he said.
‘Like, I work. I can’t just take a day off.’
Eileen Allardyce, 32, a hotel manager from Edinburgh, spent around £2,500 on tickets, travel and hotel costs and says she will not be able to make a rescheduled date.
‘Obviously, it’s not Co-op’s fault what happened in Amsterdam, and it’s not Nicki’s fault either, like, obviously, no blame for her at all,’ she said.
‘But as I say, I just feel like the way they (the venue) handled it was just absolutely ridiculous. They have no clue, like absolutely no clue. I don’t think they were prepared for anything, to be honest.’
Major Robert van Kapel, from the Royal Netherlands military police, told Sky News at around 9.15pm that the detained woman had been released around 20 minutes ago from the Royal Marshal’s Office at Schiphol Airport.
‘I don’t know which plane she will take, which destination, of course, privacy. It’s not our concern,’ he also said.
‘But I can say that 20 minutes ago, she left. So probably she’s on her way to her next destination.’
When asked if they knew the woman was a rap artist, he responded: ‘Of course, we never confirm the identity of people we have in custody, suspects.
‘But we have seen, of course, social media, and the only thing we have to do is do a thorough investigation. 
‘And that’s what we did and there’s no reason to (have her) any longer in custody. She can go wherever she has to go.’
Earlier in the day, Dutch police said a woman of Nicki’s age was arrested after allegedly trying to take soft drugs from Schiphol Airport to another country.
An update from the force at around 9pm stated that it had released the ‘suspect and she can now move on.’
The force added that she will have to pay ‘a fine’, which will be determined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Meanwhile, Nicki live-streamed the chaotic events on her social media, garnering thousands of viewers as she locked horns with authorities.
She accused them of taking her bags from her and trying to ‘sabotage’ her tour.
In clips, she is heard asking why a ‘random check’ was performed on her, later taking to X to vent that they were ‘trying to keep [her] from Manchester.’
Nicki’s postponed concert isn’t the only show to be thrown up in the air since the launch of the Co-op Live arena, in which Harry Styles invested.
Artists including Both A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Olivia Rodrigo postponed shows there, as did Take That, Peter Kay, and The Black Keys, due to the venue not being ‘ready’.
Live music finally got underway at the arena after Manchester-based band Elbow opened the new venue as its first headliners.
Frontman Guy Garvey told the audience those who had been working on the building had been ‘so excited today, so nervous and so excited’, in a video shared online.
