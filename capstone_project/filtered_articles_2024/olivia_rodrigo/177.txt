Raye called her grandmother Agatha Dawson to the stage with her as she collected Album Of The Year at the Brits on Saturday - and viewers at home were left in tears.
Looking at her grandmother, the singer, 26, said through tears: 'I want to thank my grandma for her prayers. My grandma is awake until 3AM praying for me and my beautiful sisters. I love you so much.'
Raye, who wore a stunning white gown, then looked to the audience and revealed: 'My middle name is Agatha and this Agatha Dawson, ladies and gentlemen.'
She stood back and allowed Agatha, who looked beautiful in traditional Ghanaian kente cloth, to bask in the rapturous applause that filled all corners of the O2.
The 'Escapism' singer continued: 'I'm so sorry, I want to thank all of the writers. I'm ugly crying on national television. I love music. All I wanted to be was an artist and now I'm an artist with an Album of the Year. Thank you so much, come on grandma, let's go.'

Fans of Raye and just regular viewers of the Brits took to X in their droves, most moved to tears by Raye and Grandmother Agatha
This year's BRITS were hosted by Love Island's Maya Jama, Roman Kemp and Clara Amfo, and will also feature a series of guest presenters throughout. 
Raye scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada.
As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
Dua Lipa picked up the fan-voted Pop Act gong, gushing to her fans: 'I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I'm standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me.' 
A record 98 artists were up for the new 2024 BRIT award, which has been designed by British visual artist and painter Rachel Jones.
Raye then looked to the audience and revealed: 'My middle name is Agatha, and this Agatha Dawson, ladies and gentlemen'

'It's incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.' 
Dua Lipa and Ellie Goulding pulled out all the stops as they led the performances. 
Double nominee Dua, 28, opened the ceremony with her new song Training Season from her upcoming her third studio album. 
The songstress looked incredible in an all leather look while Ellie, 37, stormed the stage just a week after announcing the end of her marriage. 
The evening ended with Dua Lipa presenting Kylie with the Global Icon Award, leading into the Aussie popstar's finale performance.
'Alright I’m just gonna be sobbing with Raye, you did that!' an emotional Kylie said as she took to the stage.
