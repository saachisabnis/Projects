Our sustainable queen!
Olivia Rodrigo is a Gen Z style star, and for veeeeeery good reason. 
The 21-year-old musician has developed a unique aesthetic that draws on aspects of grunge and the interpretation of 1990s fashion championed by brands like Marc Jacobs' Heaven. From see-through slip dresses to corset dresses, Converse high tops to fishnet tights, she's every inch a retro queen. 
Another part of her throwback aesthetic? A predilection for vintage, which was just showcased on her latest red carpet appearance for the premiere of the Guts World Tour concert film.
Styled by Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, she rocked a floor-scraping black lace knit gown with an intricate rose pattern and spaghetti straps and a scoop neck with scalloped edges. The dress was from Diorâ€™s fall/winter 1998 collection, which was designed by John Galliano. 
The sheer dress seemed to be making a nod to the naked dress trend, but was layered over a purple underlay, making it less revealing than other naked dresses we've seen. 
And Olivia wasn't the only icon on the red carpet that night! Chappell Roan (a former tour opener for Olivia) was also in attendance, rocking a burgundy, see-through dress that was giving all kinds of 'Red Wine Supernova'.
Featuring rose embellishments and styled with see-through matching opera gloves and black calf-height boots, the outfit was a seriously chic compliment to Olivia's slinky black fit. 
We can't lie we're seeeeeriously obsessed with these outfits!
