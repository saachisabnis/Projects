Famous singer Olivia Rodrigo boldly distributed free boxes of Plan B and condoms at her concert in Missouri, a Twitter post showed.
The singer sparked mixed reactions by distributing contraceptives to her fans, and has since seen a divided response on social media. Rodrigo revealed her Fund 4 Good initiative in Feb., and told fans she would be advocating for the female fans to have unrestricted access to abortions, USA Today reported. A fan who attended Rodrigo‚Äôs ‚ÄúGUTS‚Äù world tour also received information on means of funding abortion providers in the U.S. as well as a phone number for those wishing to end a pregnancy, according to TMZ. Abortions are outlawed in Missouri in the vast majority of cases.

‚ÄúI stand with Olivia, not everyone wants to be a mother and can‚Äôt provide a proper lifestyle for their child istg,‚Äù another fan wrote in response to the first tweet.
‚Äúüëèüëèüëèüëè that‚Äôs how ya put your money where your mouth is,‚Äù another fan posted.
On the other hand, some on Twitter asked her to ‚Äúrepent,‚Äù and another wrote, ‚ÄúAbortion is murder, this is shameful.‚Äù

This is just one of the ways Rodrigo has backed pro-choice organizations. She has also donated a portion of her ticket sales to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and has made abortion information widely available for her fans through the exposure of vendors that were stationed at her concert locations, USA Today reported.

Most fans were thrilled to see Rodrigo using her platform to push for change and advocate for women to make their own choices regarding abortion, but some were unimpressed by her stance.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you ‚Äî our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won‚Äôt bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today‚Äôs craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There‚Äôs a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can‚Äôt do it unless you ‚Äî 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment ‚Äî have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
