Olivia Rodrigo is back, and she’s ready to unleash a tidal wave of emotions with the deluxe edition of her electrifying sophomore album, “Guts.” Prepare yourselves, folks, because Olivia is about to spill her guts like never before!
The 21-year-old sensation is kicking off the latest edition of New Music Friday in style, treating fans to an exclusive glimpse into the depths of her soul with “Guts (Spilled).” This deluxe rendition not only includes four previously rare tracks that were harder to come by but also unveils a never-before-heard gem titled “So American.” Can you feel the excitement building?
But wait, there’s more! Olivia is pulling out all the stops with a brand-new music video accompanying the fresh track “Obsessed.” Brace yourselves for a rock-infused anthem that will send shivers down your spine and set your heart ablaze.
“I’m so obsessed with your ex / I know she’s been asleep on my side of your bed, and I can feel it,” Olivia croons, her voice dripping with raw emotion. “I’m starin’ at her like I wanna get hurt / And I remember every detail you have ever told me.”
Directed by the visionary Mitch Ryan, the music video transports us into Olivia’s world, where she stands amidst a bevy of pageant queens adorned in pristine white dresses. Each sash bears poignant words like “Miss Thought She Was the One,” a stark contrast to Olivia’s own attire—a defiant black ensemble emblazoned with the words “Miss Right Now.”
As the video unfolds, we’re drawn deeper into Olivia’s narrative, swept away by the intensity of her performance and the poignant imagery that underscores every beat of the song. It’s a visual feast for the senses, a testament to Olivia’s unrivaled talent and creative vision.
So, buckle up, folks, because Olivia Rodrigo is about to take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions with “Guts (Spilled).” Get ready to immerse yourself in a world where vulnerability meets strength, and heartache transforms into art. This is Olivia at her finest, and trust us, you won’t want to miss a single moment of it!
