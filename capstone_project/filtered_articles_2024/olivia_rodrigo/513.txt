Raye breaks records, Dua Lipa wows, and Kylie Minogue takes a quirky sip.
The BRIT Awards 2024 with Mastercard dazzled music enthusiasts with a stellar night at The O2 arena in London, and it was a celebration of women's dominance in various categories. The event, hosted by Clara Amfo, Maya Jama, and Roman Kemp, unfolded with electrifying performances and a cascade of awards.
In a groundbreaking achievement, Raye, the BRIT School graduate, emerged as the night's shining star. With seven nominations, Raye not only secured the prestigious Songwriter of the Year in advance but went on to make history with five additional wins, smashing the record for the most wins in a single night with a total of six.

Her victories included Mastercard Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Artist of the Year, Song of the Year with Mastercard, and R&B Act.
Raye's six-fold triumph surpasses the previous record of four wins held by Harry Styles (2023), Adele (2016), and Blur (1995). Her onstage glory extended with a triumphant medley performance, cementing her status as a trailblazer in the BRIT Awards legacy.
"This has been the best night of my life," expressed a jubilant Raye. "And luckily they got it all on camera so I can watch it back."
For her final speech at the podium, she brought up her grandmother, Agatha, for moral support.
"She raised me," explained the singer (whose middle name is Agatha) backstage.
"My parents worked full-time so she came from Ghana to come and raise us, she lived with us, she took us to and from school, and she poured so much love and heart into us".
The women's dominance was not confined to Raye; over half of this year's nominations featured women. The BRITs' commitment to representation was evident with category changes, including an extension of nominees in the Artist of the Year categories and the introduction of a new R&B genre award. 
The outcome was clear—three-quarters of the award wins featured women and non-binary individuals.
Dua Lipa, opening the ceremony with her debut UK performance of Training Season, added to the women's triumph by securing the Pop Act award. 
With this win, Dua Lipa's BRIT tally reached an impressive seven awards since her first win in 2018.
Jungle, delivering a mesmerising performance, claimed the Group of the Year award, showcasing the diverse musical landscape in Britain. 
International categories mirrored this trend, with SZA winning International Song of the Year for Kill Bill, boygenius securing International Group of the Year, and Miley Cyrus triumphing in the International Song of the Year category with Flowers, confirmed as the biggest-selling global single of the year.
Alternative/Rock Act celebrated Bring Me The Horizon, while Calvin Harris claimed the Dance Act award with an electric performance of 'Miracle' featuring Ellie Goulding. 
CASISDEAD's futuristic entrance secured the Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Act award.
Chase & Status, awarded Producer of the Year, brought high-energy drum 'n' bass to the stage with a performance alongside Becky Hill. 
Kylie Minogue, honoured as a BRITs Global Icon, delivered a dazzling medley closing the show.
In a quirky moment before her barnstorming performance, host Roman Kemp convinced Kylie Minogue to participate in a 'shoey,' an Australian tradition of drinking from a shoe. Pouring Kylie's signature rosé champagne into a high heel, Kemp and Kylie took a sip, creating a memorable moment.
