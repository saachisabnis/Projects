Take notes and get ready for the rush!
The string of major acts gracing Singapore in 2024 shows no signs of slowing down, and we couldn't be more thrilled. Just last week, exciting news broke out that American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo is set to command the stage at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on October 1, as part of her Guts World Tour. This will be the three-time Grammy award-winning artistâ€™s very first time performing in Asia and Australia. Due to overwhelming demand, the singer has added a second show in Singapore, so if you have yet to snag tickets, here's your chance.
As with all ticket-purchasing frenzies, itâ€™s a classic case of â€˜fastest fingers firstâ€™, so weâ€™re here to make sure that you arm yourself with all the necessary information before going into battle. Not a bad idea right? Read on, take notes, and good luck!

Olivia Rodrigo will be performing in Singapore for two nights on October 1 and 2, 2024, at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
Tickets for the first show are already sold out, but ticket sales for the second show will start on May 23, 2024, from 2pm onwards via Ticketmaster and their hotline at +65 3158 8588.
Tickets are priced at $108 for Cat 6, $128 for Cat 5, $148 for Cat 4, $168 for Cat 3, $208 for Cat 2, $168 for Cat 1 standing, and $308 for VIP standing.
The VIP ticket includes one standing ticket (priced at $188) to the VIP Zone, early entry into the venue before standard ticket holders, one official VIP laminate and lanyard, one specially designed VIP gift item and early access to the merch counter.
Do note that youâ€™ll only be able to purchase four tickets per transaction.Â
