The singer joined boyfriend Louis Partridge at the premiere of his new TV series Disclaimer in Venice. Rodrigo kept a fairly low profile (though she and Partridge did show a touch of PDA, arriving hand-in-hand), dressing the part of the supportive partner. She wore an understated black floor-length slip dress with ultra-thin spaghetti straps reminiscent of something straight from the ’90s. The dress was patterned with flora and fauna silhouettes in a black velvet burnout. She added a turn-of-the-millennium touch with a large black rosette affixed to the centre of her neckline.

The singer opted for timeless accessories, wearing a pair of black cat-eye sunglasses, strappy black sandals, and a simple black clutch. The only hint of colour was her red lipstick and her coordinating nail polish.
Partridge, for his part, leaned more ’70s with a wide lapel and exaggerated collar on his white button-down. Together, the couple looked like a total blast from the past.
