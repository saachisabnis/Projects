US pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo stunned fans after being spotted enjoying a short break in the Welsh seaside town of Llandudno. The singer, known for her hits such as Drivers Licence and Traitor, was seen at the Ormo Lounge bar and restaurant as well as the local Marks and Spencer store where she took a selfie with staff member and fan Rose.
The photo was shared on the store's Facebook page, sparking excitement amongst locals and Rodrigo fans. They are wondering what the superstar is doing in North Wales with some suggesting it may be due to her relationship with Louis Partridge. The actor, who has Welsh and English family ties and was raised in London but has holidayed in Llandudno in the past, was with Rodrigo at the Ormo Lounge.
Marks and Spencer Llandudno said of the unexpected visit: "Olivia Rodrigo visiting our store was not on our 2024 bingo card. Our customer assistant Rose had the pleasure of meeting pop star Olivia Rodrigo in M&S Parc Llandudno today!"
North Wales Live said fans took to Facebook to congratulate Rose on getting a photo with the star with one saying: "Well done Rose for getting a pic. I would have been too starstuck - I bet she loved meeting you." Another added: "Couldn't be in better hands than Rose."
