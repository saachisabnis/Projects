There must be something in the air in Melbourne, because Coldplay's Chris Martin fell through a trap door on stage just weeks after Olivia Rodrigo found herself in a similar situation.
While performing at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne on Coldplay's "Music Of The Spheres World Tour," Chris Martin was addressing the crowd as he was walking backwards, and fell right through a trap door on stage! Thankfully, someone was there to catch him before he really took a tumble. 
After re-emerging from the hole, Martin said, "That's not planned. Thank you for catching me, so much." See a fan-shot video of the fall below.
Just a few weeks ago while at a "GUTS World Tour" stop in Melbourne at a different venue, Olivia Rodrigo also fell through a hole on stage after running over to greet her fans. She ended up being OK, and continued on with her show, but ended up going to the hospital to be examined to be safe.
Coldplay kicked off their "Music of the Spheres World Tour" in 2022, and recently released their newest installment of Music of the Spheres — Moon Music. Moon Music is Coldplay's 10th full-length album, and showcases 10 new songs, including the previously-released "Feels Like I'm Falling In Love," "We Pray" (which features with Little Simz, Burna Boy, Elyanna, and Tini) and All My Love."
The band is continuing their tour in Australia, stopping in Sydney, before moving onto Auckland, New Zealand, followed by United Arab Emirates and then Asia.
