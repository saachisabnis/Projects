	Once a Wildcat, always a Wildcat. Some of Olivia Rodrigo‘s former High School Musical: The Musical: The Series castmates showed their support for the 21-year-old pop star by coming to see her Guts World Tour show at Madison Square Garden Tuesday night (April 9), after which they all met up backstage to pose for a photo. 

	In grainy videos taken by fans at the concert, Disney actors Larry Saperstein, Julia Lester, Joe Serafini and Frankie Rodriguez were among the 10-thousand-plus fans at the venue, where Rodrigo played her final of four New York City Guts shows. After she performed tracks from Guts as well as her hit debut album Sour — much of which has long been rumored to be about HSM costar Joshua Bassett, who was not in attendance — Rodrigo greeted the gang backstage.

	










	“danced our GUTS off!! 💜,” Saperstein wrote on Instagram afterward, sharing a photo of the five stars smiling for the camera with Liv in the center.

	Also in attendance were Conan Gray, Rodrigo’s best friend and fellow singer-songwriter, as well as Heartstopper‘s Joe Locke. Another fan video captured the two dancing together to the headliner’s closing number, “Get Him Back!”

	The “Drivers License” singer’s four-night stay at MSG was eventful, with both Noah Kahan and Jewel taking the stage at separate shows for surprise guest duets with Rodrigo. During her first night in New York City, she spotted yet another High School Musical costar in the crowd: Michelle Noh, who played Rodrigo’s character’s mom in the series.

	With the final MSG show in the books, Rodrigo has officially wrapped the North American leg of her first-ever arena tour. Later this month, she’ll launch a run of European shows starting in Dublin, after which she’ll return to the U.S. on July 19 for a performance at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.
