If you've ever been to a live concert to see your favorite artist or band perform, you've probably walked away with a souvenir of the experience. Band t-shirts are a must-have at the merch booth, either before or after the show.
Not only do band t-shirts show the world that you saw an amazing concert, but also stay with you for a lifetime as a remembrance of that show.
Custom InkÂ is a t-shirt printer that creates custom t-shirts and they produce some quality shirts. The New England Pinball League, which I am a part of, orders t-shirts each year for our nearly 500 players across New England, and they always come out great.
Custom Ink recently did a deep dive into what the most popular band t-shirts are in each state. They used Google search volume data and surveyed 1,000 Americans to determine what each state's favorite band t-shirt was.
Olivia Rodrigo was the most popular nationwide, but what came out on top for each of the New England states? Let's take a look.
Rhode Island "Gets the Party Started" by choosing Pink as their favorite t-shirt.
Vermont found a "New Love" for Dua Lipa when she came onto the music scene in 2017.
"Good 4 U", Massachusetts, for being a fan of the very talented Olivia Rodrigo.
"I Hope" New Hampshire isn't the only state that is a fan of country sensation Gabby Barrett.
Maine is also one of "The Good Ones" who love Gabby Barrett.
Connecticut wasn't "Speechless" when declaring Dan + Shay the perfect band t-shirt.
