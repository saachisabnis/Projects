She’s your favorite artist’s favorite artist! Chappell Roan has become a “Femininomenon” in the pop world, and your fav celebrities are just as obsessed with her as you are. From Ariana Grande to Olivia Rodrigo, keep reading for a list of all the artists who have praised the singer.
Born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz on February 19, 1998, in Willard, Missouri, Chappell’s musical journey is deeply rooted in her personal history. Adopting her stage moniker as a tribute to her late grandfather, Dennis K. Chappell, who succumbed to brain cancer in 2016, her music carries an emotional resonance that resonates deeply with audiences.
“I think Chappell’s a drag-queen version of me because it’s very larger-than-life,” she said of her stage name during a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair. “Kind of tacky, not afraid to say really lewd things. The songs are kind of the fairytale version of what happened in real life. A lot of the songs are just enhanced versions of what happened or maybe they never happened at all.”
Chappell’s affinity for music blossomed at a young age, and she began showcasing her vocal prowess through covers when she was 14 years old, garnering attention from discerning ears and industry insiders alike. This early recognition paved the way for a record deal with Atlantic Records.
The “Good Luck, Babe!” singer relocated to Los Angeles in 2018, and would soon find her frequent collaborator/producer in Dan Nigro, who is renowned for his work with Olivia Rodrigo.
Despite her 2020 hit “Pink Pony Club,” Atlantic actually dropped Chappell from their label. Over the next two years, she worked odd jobs to support herself. But in 2022, she made a comeback with songs like “Naked In Manhattan” and “Casual,” launching her own tour. Signing with Island Records under Dan Nigro’s imprint Amusement Records and KRA International, she finally released her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September 2023.
Since then, she’s become pop music’s biggest thing — selling out shows, culminating huge audience turnouts at popular festivals such as Coachella, Boston Calling and Gov Ball. Not only that, some of the most popular names in music have started to praise the larger-than-life songstress.

“I’ve been talking about her for the last 48 hours,” the actor said of Chappell during a December 2024 interview with MTV UK, before diving into his favorite song of hers.
“Honestly, too many to name. ‘Red Wine Supernova’ is killing me. ‘Good Luck, Babe!’, ‘Pink Pony Club’ obviously, ‘HOT TO GO!’ obviously. That whole album I’m just listening front-to-back every morning in the gym, to be honest,” he replied.
“It’s a genius album, nothing like this has come along in so long,” he added.

During an October 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, the legendary ’70s singer spoke about Chappell’s rise to fame and sympathized with her comments about struggling being in the spotlight.
“Me and a friend of mine went and looked at her schedule, and it was outrageous. What she’s already done and then what she’s going into. It’s as bad as any schedule we ever did, and she’s new, and she’s young,” Stevie shared. “I said, ‘They’ll burn her out if that’s what they want to do, because there’s always somebody to replace you.’ It must make them all very fearful. That’s why it’s good that Chappell just said, ‘Well, go ahead, replace me. I’m canceling because I’m not going to drop dead for all you people.’”

Miley and Chappell aren’t just fans of one another, but also friends! The “Good Luck, Babe!” singer revealed that the Hannah Montana star invited her on a night out.
“Miley invited me to a party, and I was like, ‘You don’t know that you were my first concert when the Jonas Brothers were opening for you,’” Chappell revealed to podcast host Drew Afualo in July 2024.
On top of that, Miley defended Chappell during an interview with Harper’s Bazaar in November 2024.
“I wish people would not give her a hard time,” Miley said of the singer. “It’s probably really hard coming into this business with phones and Instagram. That wasn’t always a part of my life, and I’m not a part of it now. I don’t even have my Instagram password.”

After being asked by Jake Shane if there was any artist Charli had on the radar, the “Yuck” singer said Chappell!
“I just think she’s doing something a little different, which I think is really cool,” she told the podcast host in May 2024. “I just think she’s gonna have a lot of longevity as an artist, and I don’t think its just about this one moment. She seems really smart, she has taste, she has references, she’s being herself, not conforming — I just can see her career being long and fruitful which I think is cool because I don’t think there are enough people who are thinking outside of the next song they’re releasing.”
