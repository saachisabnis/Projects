The night kicks off with a thrilling number to "Murder on the Dancefloor" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor choreographed by Emma Slater and Gleb Savchenko. The pros and troupe will embrace the witchy vibes with a routine set to "The Ballad Of The Witches' Road (Sacred Chant Version)" from "Agatha All Along" choreographed by Britt Stewart and Ezra Sosa. There are even more tricks and treats, including a Derek Hough Masterclass focused on wardrobe tips, along with a spooky fast-paced number to "Aserejé" by Jean Massey, choreographed by Daniella Karagach and Pasha Pashkov.

Partner dances will include the Argentine Tango, Contemporary, Viennese Waltz and Tango and the night will feature the return of the "Dance-Offs"; two at a time, couples face off against one another on the ballroom floor as they dance head-to-head in the same style at the same time. Winners of each of the three Dance-Offs will be selected by the judges, and the winning couple from each dance-off will receive bonus points added to their judges' totals for the night. Based on the leaderboard from last week's scores, as well as cumulative scores across the season so far, Chandler Kinney and Brandon Armstrong have received immunity and will not have to participate, receiving bonus points as part of their immunity.

Partner dances will include the Argentine Tango, Contemporary, Viennese Waltz and Tango and the night will feature the return of the "Dance-Offs"; two at a time, couples face off against one another on the ballroom floor as they dance head-to-head in the same style at the same time. Winners of each of the three Dance-Offs will be selected by the judges, and the winning couple from each dance-off will receive bonus points added to their judges' totals for the night. Based on the leaderboard from last week's scores, as well as cumulative scores across the season so far, Chandler Kinney and Brandon Armstrong have received immunity and will not have to participate, receiving bonus points as part of their immunity.
