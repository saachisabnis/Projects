	Olivia Rodrigo spilled her guts onstage at the long awaited opening night of her Guts world tour on Friday (Feb. 23) at Acrisure Arena in Palm Springs, Calif.

	With two albums now under her belt, the freshly 21-year-old pop superstar had no shortage of hits to get the crowd belting their hearts — or guts, rather — out, including her Billboard Hot 100-chart topping lead single ballads like Sour’s breakout hit, “Drivers License” and her blood-sucking Guts opera-tinged track, “Vampire.”

	She also brought the energy with guitar-driven rock tracks like “Get Him Back!,” “All-American B—-,” “Bad Idea Right?” as well as “Brutal,” “Deja Vu” and more.

	Rodrigo will continue to perform in North America through April, where she’s scheduled a pair of dates for April 5 and 6 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, then heads overseas, beginning her international dates on April 30 in Dublin, Ireland. The pop star returns to the United States with a July 19 show in Philadelphia, and wraps her world tour with two concerts at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on Aug. 13 and 14.

	Check out the setlist below for Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts tour, based on the opening night at Acrisure Arena in Palm Springs, Calif.
