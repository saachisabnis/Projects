Justin announced with wife Hailey that they are expecting their first child in May.
In her latest interview with W Magazine, Hailey shared that she is cherishing her last moments with her husband in her third trimester ahead of welcoming their baby.
“In the beginning [of pregnancy], it was super emotional for me. Like, ‘I love this human so much. How can I possibly bring someone else into this?’ ” she told the outlet. “I’m trying to soak in these days of it being Justin and me, just the two of us.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Hailey also confirmed that she recently got her engagement ring, designed by Lorraine Schwartz, upgraded — after fans spotted the larger stone size in an Instagram post she shared in May. 
“Actually, this is only one carat bigger. It’s just elongated,” the mom-to-be told the outlet.
