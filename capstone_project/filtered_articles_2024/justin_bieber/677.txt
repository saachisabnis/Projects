 Hailey Bieber is getting closer to meeting her little one on the way.

 The Rhode founder, 27, shared a series of photos on her Instagram on Tuesday, July 30, which included a few snaps of herself in a long white, skin-tight sheer gown.

 Donning a white headscarf and matching white sunglasses, Bieber faces the camera in one black-and-white photo, placing a hand under her bump. A second photo in color shot shows the mom-to-be in a garden, posing with one hand on her bump and one on her hip.

 "some bits 🥐🧈🐣🌼🍯," Bieber captioned her post.

 Earlier this week, Justin Bieber posted a video on Instagram showing the couple cradling Hailey's growing bump while seemingly attending an outdoor dinner party.

 Hailey wore the same dress for the occasion, and Justin lifted the top layer of his wife's outfit so his followers could catch a glimpse of her belly. She completed her glam get-up with a pair of white-rimmed sunglasses and a glittering 'b' necklace.

 The Biebers were all smiles in the clip as Hailey continued to rub her stomach while Justin stood behind her wearing a casual white T-shirt and fluorescent beanie hat.

 The couple announced their pregnancy in a joint Instagram post on May 9. The post included a video of their vow renewal.

 Around the time of their announcement, a rep for Hailey confirmed to PEOPLE that she was just over six months pregnant.

 Hailey recently spoke to W Magazine, saying that keeping her pregnancy under wraps for that long came with emotional challenges. “I probably could have hid it until the end,” the supermodel told the outlet.

 However, the mom-to-be said she "didn’t enjoy the stress of not being able to enjoy my pregnancy outwardly."

 "I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn’t feel good," she admitted. "I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life."
