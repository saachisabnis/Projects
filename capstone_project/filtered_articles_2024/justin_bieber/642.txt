 In the carousel post, Hailey posed to the side as she cradled her bump, which she highlighted with a white cropped T-shirt and unbuttoned jeans. Her back jeans pocket also featured four Rhode lip products.

 Hailey and Justin announced their exciting pregnancy news in a joint Instagram post on May 9. 

 Sharing a clip from their vow renewal, Hailey wore a lacy white dress over her baby bump, with a rep confirming to PEOPLE that the model was just over six months pregnant at the time.

 Meanwhile, earlier this month, Hailey revealed that she had been suffering from lower back pain. 

 "So who was gonna tell me about the lower back pain?" she wrote alongside pregnancy emojis as she sat down in a chair.
