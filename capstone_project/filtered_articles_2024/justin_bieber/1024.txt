There is no denying that Crocs are the moment. While divisive, the clog-like shoe has won the hearts of millions in the past two decades, going from becoming a laughing stock to a red carpet staple. Initially receiving negative reactions from the fashion industry, Crocs was able to change the narrative on slip-ons, capitalizing on critics’ intense hatred for the shoe. While fashion aficionados were not immediately sold on the rubber-holed clog, Crocs has evolved into becoming one of footwear’s biggest giants. The Colorado-based company is now so well-known around the world that Crocs Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ, quietly outperforming some of the biggest players on the market in the past decade.
When it comes to Crocs, no one is neutral with their stance. Since Crocs first debuted in 2002, people have fallen into one of two categories — those who love it for its functionality and comfort and those who mercilessly mock the plastic clog. However, since the pandemic, Crocs has been able to convert some of these clog haters to lovers. Much like companies such as Zoom and Etsy, Crocs’ business boomed during the early days of the pandemic when people around the world began opting for comfort over style. The company, which has long been marketed as easy slip-ons that were durable and unbeatable in comfort, began making a case for being the perfect footwear to use around their homes, in their gardens and kitchens around the time of quarantine. Crocs quickly gained fans who craved comfort amidst the lockdown and beyond. 
With the help of famous partnerships through celebrity endorsements and collaborations with the likes of Post Malone, Palace, Justin Bieber and Balenciaga, just to name a few, the clog brand has now become a household staple. While they are successful in their innovative and comfortable design as well as their functionality as a lightweight, durable and waterproof outdoor and indoor shoe, much of Crocs’ success is all in its marketing. 
When faced with negativity, brands often try to change the narrative or perhaps even rebrand for a positive message. However, when met with initial disgust over the aesthetic, Crocs embraced how polarizing their shoes are and harnessed consumers’ visceral reaction to drive the clogs’ narrative. Instead of defending the shoe, they have seized the opportunity to let the shoe represent some of the most creative, radical and individual styles in the shoe game. By partnering with young celebrities like Post Malone and Justin Bieber, Crocs enters the mainstream all while gaining the approval of some of the most followed influencers in the world. Crocs focuses on how unique their shoes can be and as Heidi Cooley, Crocs SVP and CMO once said in a statement, 
“Yes, we’re ugly; yes, we’re polarizing. But importantly, we’re one-of-a-kind. And what we recognized is that this is exactly what resonated with some of our fans: They too see themselves as one-of-a-kind.”
After years of financial loss, 2018 saw the rise of Crocs, growing exponentially to become “the” pandemic shoe. Following the pandemic, the brand expanded its reach by embracing its celebrity fans. Crocs worked with non-conforming celebrities to customize their own clogs to match their eccentricity, like Diplo who created one to match his psychedelic, hippy style. Later, Post Malone’s clogs with the chunky sole were created with his hardcore tattooed aesthetic in mind and Bieber’s Crocs with oversized Jibbitz stayed true to his happy, go lucky message with his brand, Drew. Crocs continued to curate a broad range of styles, ensuring inclusivity for all. From a KFC collaboration to one with Coca-Cola and even playful ones that pay homage to McDonald’s iconic characters, Crocs makes sure they are not taking themselves very seriously. With fun being central to the brand and accepting itself to be the antithesis of what is traditionally seen as “good taste,” Crocs created its own niche in the footwear market. 
However, over time, fashionistas have given the clogs a second chance. In 2017, Balenciaga‘s Demna incorporated Crocs’ uniqueness to its Fall/Winter 2018 line where he introduced Balenciaga Platform Crocs. Placing the luxury stamp on Crocs changed the game for streetwear and fashion lovers alike. The eye-catching, chunky-heeled Balenciaga Crocs arrived in vibrant yellow and pink, stomping onto the scene to turn heads and drop jaws. Prior to Balenciaga, Crocs had flirted with fashion before, collaborating first with Christopher Kane. Both brands were unlikely collaborators but they were inspired by Crocs’ innovative moulding technology and wanted to bring comfort to luxury. Known for his ironic fashion sense, Demna continued with the Crocs, proving collaboration after collaboration that the clogs were indeed a good fit with Balenciaga. Adding a five-inch platform to the clog became the norm, even inspiring Lil Nas X‘s first “The Height” collection as the new Crocs global ambassador in July 2023.

Balenciaga’s continued collaboration with Crocs paved the way for the clog brand to become a streetwear staple. On top of releasing high-fashion inspired silhouettes like the Crocs Stiletto, the shoe brand infiltrated streetwear pillars like Palace, BEAMS and PLEASURES to minimalist brands like Museum of Peace and Quiet, with their own collaborations. 
In addition to the aforementioned releases, one of the most sought-after Crocs nowadays are Salehe Bembury‘s Pollex Clog collaboration. With Bembury’s iteration, which sees the clog inspired by his own thumbprint and feature a new design altogether, the brand has been able to tap into the streetwear community, changing the way the clog is valued in footwear fashion. In a statement regarding Bembury and Croc’s partnership extension, Michelle Poole, Crocs Brand President said, “His unique approach to design has brought a fresh perspective to our molded form and enabled us to connect with new consumers. Looking ahead, we are excited to continue this partnership and extend into dynamic new silhouettes.” Staying true to the idea of uniqueness, Bembury’s design ethos for Crocs does just that, bringing his one-of-a-kind thumbprint to marry innovation and utility to propel a modern design language to Crocs.

All about the pizzazz and the element of shock, audiences see that Crocs is leaning more into never-before-seen creative concepts. Embracing individuality, Crocs takes more design risks, fuelled by what Balenciaga and Bembury have laid the foundations for. The brand also stays true to its roots and understands that its designs must always go back to the initial polarizing perspective that garnered the attention of consumers. From ogre-inspired Shrek clogs to its Classic Cowboy Boot, Crocs is all about the unconventional, all while providing a design for everyone. Whether you’re a chocolate lover who enjoys Hershey’s or an anime lover deep into Demon Slayer, Crocs has a shoe for you.
Nothing is out of the realm of possibilities for the Colorado clog company as it becomes more intertwined with mainstream culture. Viral moments such as MSCHF’s Big Yellow Boots which featured a campaign with Paris Hilton, see popular culture give their stamp of approval to the clog, once known to be just semi-fashionable at best. As the brand continues to lean into its playfulness and leverage the Internet meme culture to stay relevant in the news cycle, Crocs will remain a household name that goes beyond the everyday trend. Longevity of the brand comes from Crocs’ ability to be rooted in functionality and comfort, but with a dose of uniqueness that matches the individual. Crocs have come a long way from being a fashion faux pas. As they continue to make their case for comfort over conventional style and bringing exuberance to footwear, Crocs are sure to sustain their upward trajectory. Here’s to seeing what 2024 has to bring.

All about the pizzazz and the element of shock, audiences see that Crocs is leaning more into never-before-seen creative concepts. Embracing individuality, Crocs takes more design risks, fuelled by what Balenciaga and Bembury have laid the foundations for. The brand also stays true to its roots and understands that its designs must always go back to the initial polarizing perspective that garnered the attention of consumers. From ogre-inspired Shrek clogs to its Classic Cowboy Boot, Crocs is all about the unconventional, all while providing a design for everyone. Whether you’re a chocolate lover who enjoys Hershey’s or an anime lover deep into Demon Slayer, Crocs has a shoe for you.
Nothing is out of the realm of possibilities for the Colorado clog company as it becomes more intertwined with mainstream culture. Viral moments such as MSCHF’s Big Yellow Boots which featured a campaign with Paris Hilton, see popular culture give their stamp of approval to the clog, once known to be just semi-fashionable at best. As the brand continues to lean into its playfulness and leverage the Internet meme culture to stay relevant in the news cycle, Crocs will remain a household name that goes beyond the everyday trend. Longevity of the brand comes from Crocs’ ability to be rooted in functionality and comfort, but with a dose of uniqueness that matches the individual. Crocs have come a long way from being a fashion faux pas. As they continue to make their case for comfort over conventional style and bringing exuberance to footwear, Crocs are sure to sustain their upward trajectory. Here’s to seeing what 2024 has to bring.
