Justin Bieber is sharing more pictures of Hailey Bieber's baby bump.
On May 24, the “Baby” singer shared some snaps of his wife showing off her pregnant belly while wearing some cute outfits. The new photos come after the couple revealed on May 9 that they're expecting their first child together.
In one pic, Hailey Bieber, 27, held her belly while wearing a black sheer top and leather jacket with blue jeans. Then, in another snap, she donned a white crop top and posed next to her hubby outside.
Justin Bieber, 30, captioned the pics, “They wish baby, they wish.”
This isn't the first time fans have seen Hailey Bieber's baby bump.
On May 15, Hailey Bieber shared her own pregnancy pictures. She shared a collection of photos alongside a caption that read, "the past few weeks have been 🐣✨🤍🌴😴💤🌸🌸🌅🥹🥹🥹🥹." The post included several snaps of Hailey Bieber and her belly.
The couple first revealed their baby news on May 9. Both Hailey and Justin Bieber shared a video and series of photos in which the model is seen showing off a baby bump in a white gown while the couple stands outside in a ceremony.
A spokesperson for Hailey Bieber tells NBC News that the model is a little over six months pregnant.
Yves Saint Laurent confirmed in a press release that the Biebers took part in a vow renewal in Hawaii on May 9. The fashion house added that they wore Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello during the ceremony.
On May 10, a day after the couple's baby announcement, the model took to her Instagram stories to share a full length pic of herself showing off her baby bump in the same white dress she wore in the photoshoot and video to announce her pregnancy.
Fans briefly wondered whether Justin and Hailey Bieber are set to welcome twins due to a comment his mother, Pattie Mallette, left on a post by Hailey's father, Stephen Baldwin, celebrating the pregnancy.
She wrote to Baldwin, "Congratulations Grandpa! WE ARE GONNA HAVE THE CUTEST GRAND-BABIES EVER!"
That's grandbabies, plural, which did not go unnoticed by some. Mallette quickly clarified in a separate comment, "No not twins lol I wish. I just mean in general. Hopefully they will have more than one eventually. They will make beautiful babies whenever they have them. One is enough for now 😂."
Justin and Hailey Bieber married in September 2018, and then one year later, they had another wedding ceremony in South Carolina with guests that included Usher, Kylie Jenner and others.
“My bride is 🔥,” Justin Bieber wrote in an Instagram with photos of their special day.
The singer was candid about married life in the years that followed, sharing that he thought getting married would "fix all my problems."
“It just kind of was a reflection of, like, ‘You’re a bit of a hypocrite, man. Like, you want your wife to do something that you’re not doing.’ And it’s like, I mean, it’s hard sometimes to look in the mirror and really have to realize, ‘Man, maybe you’re not the person that you necessarily thought that you were.’ And, you know, that’s just the result of trauma and life circumstances,” he said on “The Ebro Show” in May 2022.
The couple has faced a range of health issues since tying the knot, from Hailey Bieber finding a small blood clot in her brain in 2022 to Justin Bieber being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
More recently, the couple celebrated Justin Bieber turning 30 in March, with Hailey writing on Instagram that "words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are."
In an interview with pastor Judah Smith from April 2024, Hailey Bieber said they wanted to have children at a young age.
"We always talked about wanting to be married and be young and have kids young," Hailey Bieber said.
