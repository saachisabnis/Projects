 Justin and Hailey Bieber are just over the moon to be welcoming their first child together. In fact, they're so excited for the little one's arrival that they've already picked out a name, according to People. A source told the outlet that when the couple found out that Haileyâ€”who is six months alongâ€”was pregnant, it was "just the best day for them."

 "Everyone is excited for them," the insider said. "They will be great parents, and Justin will be super involved. This will be the next important project for him. Heâ€™s so excited to raise his baby. They have a name that they think is perfect. Theyâ€™re also starting to decorate a nursery. They canâ€™t wait to meet the baby."

 The Biebers announced that they would be adding a new addition to their family on Thursday with a sweet Instagram post that also documented their vow renewal. In the roundup, Hailey and Justin can be sharing a few kisses while also exchanging vows. The photos captured Justin snapping pictures of his wife, who wore an off-the-shoulder lace Saint Laurent dress and a matching veil.

 Justin's mom, Pattie Mallette, also got in on the excitement while also accidentally sending the internet into a tizzy. Fans started to speculate that the couple was expecting twins after Mallette commented on a post from Hailey's dad, Stephen Baldwin, writing, "Congratulations Grandpa! WE ARE GONNA HAVE THE CUTEST GRAND-BABIES EVER!"Â

 Mallette quickly clarified her comment by adding, â€œNo not twins lol I wish. I just mean in general."

 As of now, Mallette confirmed it'll just be the three of them.

 "Hopefully they will have more than one eventually," she added. "They will make beautiful babies whenever they have them. One is enough for now ðŸ˜‚."
