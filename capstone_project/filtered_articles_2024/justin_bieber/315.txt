	It’s Halloween, and Hailey Bieber just gave the sweetest treat to all her followers. The Rhode founder posted a rare new glimpse of her baby boy Jack Blues, who she shares with husband Justin Bieber, and he is rocking the brightest color.

	










	“Happy Halloween!” Hailey wrote on her Instagram story today. (PEOPLE has a screenshot HERE.) “Get out there and vote 👻”

	The picture shows a close-up of the 2-month-old, who is resting happily in a baby carrier. Jack Blues is wearing a bold magenta onesie, which looks super cozy with the bottom folded over his feet to keep his little toes warm. Considering how many baby socks I lost when my own kids were little, this method is genius!

	On baby Jack’s foot is an “I Voted” sticker. Imagine running into Hailey and Jack while out early voting for the presidential election? It would totally not be the time to fangirl or fawn over a new baby, but it would be so, so hard not to.

	The Biebers haven’t posted about their son since sharing a picture of his little foot to announce his birth back in August. “WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻” they wrote at the time.

	And even though they haven’t shared a picture of his face (or even his full body) yet, Hailey’s dad Stephen Baldwin hinted that it may happen soon.

	“And of course, here comes Jack Blues Bieber. And yeah, he’s just… I don’t want to say too much. He’s unbelievably cute,” he told PEOPLE last month, adding that “the world will see him soon.” Maybe they’ll reveal his photo for Christmas?! You never know!
