Hailey Bieber has a strong message for anyone speculating about the state of her marriage to husband Justin.
Since their wedding six years ago, the couple have regularly been at the centre of online conspiracy theories and speculation on social media about their relationship.
This was exacerbated even further last month, when Hailey’s dad Stephen Baldwin reposted a cryptic message asking fans to pray for his daughter and her famous husband.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Hailey posted a message on her Instagram story, which read: “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong. Made out of thin air. Come from the land of delusion.
“So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false.”
“Sorry to spoil it,” she then joked.

Last week, Hailey posted an emotional message on Instagram to mark her husband’s 30th birthday.
“30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!! That was fast,” she wrote. “Words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life.”

Although they’d known each other for years before their friendship took a romantic turn, Justin and Hailey had only been dating for a matter of weeks when they announced their engagment in 2018.
They tied the knot in a private ceremony in New York a few months later, when Justin was 24 and Hailey was 21.
Back in 2021, the chart-topping singer admitted that he found the first 12 months of his marriage to Hailey “really tough”, saying his past “trauma” meant he spent much of that period “on eggshells”.
