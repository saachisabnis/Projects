 Hailey and Justin Bieber are reportedly "overjoyed" and "doing well" at home with their new baby, Jack Blues.

 "They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well," an inside source told People. "Hailey's doing well, too."

 The source explained that the couple see their new arrival as a "miracle." "The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for," said the source. "The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant was the best ever for Justin. He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them."

 Added the source, "Justin's already a great dad."

 Justin announced the news of the baby's arrival on Instagram last week, writing,  "WELCOME HOME. JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻," alongside an image of Hailey's hand—complete with a fresh French tip manicure—gently holding the baby's foot.

 Apparently, the manicure was actually all Justin's idea. “Justin has been choosing Hailey’s nail design lately and it was his request," said Hailey's manicurist, Zola Ganzorigt, to Vogue.

 Hailey previously announced her pregnancy in May, when she shared video footage and photos from her and her husband's vow renewal ceremony. In the carousel, Hailey can be seen wearing a white lace off-the-shoulder gown that reveals her growing bump.

 As Hailey later told W Magazine, she hid her pregnancy for several months. “I was honestly able to keep it quiet because I stayed small for a long time,” she said. “I didn’t have a belly, really, until I was six months pregnant, which was when I announced it. I was able to wear big jackets and stuff.”

 Since then, Hailey has made a few appearances both on social media and out and about—and every time, she made the case for wearing revealing, sexy maternity wear. As she previously told W Magazine back in 2022, she had always planned on taking inspiration from Rihanna when it came to her pregnancy fashion. "She was the most gorgeous, hottest pregnant woman I’ve ever seen. And I think I’ll only know when that time comes, but yeah," she said, "I definitely don’t want to feel like I have to sacrifice my style when being pregnant. My style is something that’s really important to me."
