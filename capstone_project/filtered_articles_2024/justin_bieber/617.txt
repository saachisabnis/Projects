Lady Gaga is dropping a companion album to Joker: Folie À Deux titled Harlequin, a nod to her character in the Joker sequel, Harley “Lee” Quinn.
The album, featuring 13 tracks (many of which are covers), will be released this Friday, September 27, a week before the movie’s release.
Gaga had been teasing her next album, LG7, for a while, and she dropped hints about the project along with her press schedule at the Venice Film Festival.
That could still be a separate album, as the first single for that work will arrive sometime in October after the film and Harlequin have been released.
Check out the Harlequin cover art and tracklist below.
Harlequin is out on 9/27 via Little Monsters/Interscope.
