"Our stunner of a daughter was born at 11:22pm on the 23rd of August by emergency cesarean. Our hearts have literally exploded into a million pieces," the British model wrote, adding, "Shy Trinity Afua Wheatley. what the f–k."
Hailey reacted to the announcement, writing, "baby Shy!!!!" which prompted Aboah, 32, to reply, "a day apart. 💔💔💔🐣🐣🐣," meaning that baby Jack was probably born on August 22.

He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them. Justin's already a great dad."
"WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER," Justin wrote, with his wife re-sharing the photo on her Instagram Stories. Celebrities, family members and fans reacted to the news. "Your blessing has arrived ♥️" wrote Katy Perry.
