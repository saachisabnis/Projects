Hailey Bieber is closing out the year with a strong message. Amid the flurry of divorce rumors with Justin Bieber, she seemingly clapped back at all the haters out there.
In the last couple of weeks, many people have come forward with speculation that Hailey and Justin were heading towards a divorce. “I just received a tip about Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, and it doesn’t look like things are going too well,” TikTok influencer Sloan Hooks said in a viral video. He alleged that Justin posted an Instagram story with Jacquees’ song “B.E.D.” which includes the lyric that a person“wants to f–k and doesn’t want love.”

The pop culture investigator alleged that just “20 minutes later,” Hailey reacted to her husband’s post by posting a screenshot of the lyrics from SZA’s song “30 For 30″: “But if it’s f–k me, then f–k you.” He also went on to observe that Justin had reposted a story with the caption, “Coparenting is failing, like tf.”

But is there really trouble in paradise or is everything a drawn out rumor? 
In an Instagram story posted on December 30, 2024, Hailey Bieber reposted a TikTok where a man repeatedly tells the camera “You’re not well, and it’s OK.” She wrote on top of the video, “me to all of you on the internet.”
This isn’t the first time this year, or even in the past couple of months, that the couple scoffed at divorce rumors. “They laugh at the constant divorce rumors,” an insider told People in November 2024. “It’s annoying but just noise.” Right after the couple welcomed their first child Jack Blues, another source told the magazine that the two silenced out the world. “They seem even more in love since the baby arrived,” the source revealed. “[Justin’s] been in a happy bubble since baby Jack was born. He wants to focus on being a great dad and husband.”
Hailey even directly told her followers in March to not believe what blind items are saying. “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong Made out of thin air… Come from the land of delusion…” she wrote on her Instagram story. “So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it.”
