Justin Bieber and his wife Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) are one of the many celebrity couples who have decided to keep their child’s lives as private as possible — shielding them from the paparazzi and rarely (if ever) showing their kids’ faces on social media. And so when it comes to their nearly 4-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber, we don’t know what the little guy looks like. All we have to go by is the random shot of the top of his head or his little feet.

	










	That is until now. Hailey’s dad spoke with TooFab about spending Christmas with Jack Blues and described just what the infant looks like.

	“He’s grown like a weed,” Stephen Baldwin said. “Actually, he looks like a little plump potato. He’s so cute. I can’t stand it.”

	A little plump potato?! Are you kidding me?! He must be so cute and chunky! We respect a parent’s right to keep their child’s life private (in fact, it drives us insane when fans feel entitled to see the kids’ faces and get mean when they don’t get their way), but now we really want to see Jack Blues. Can we just get the quickest peek at your undoubtedly adorable “little plump potato,” Justin and Hailey? He must be so sweet and smooshy!



	Baldwin also revealed what his grandson will call him once he starts speaking. “We’re going with Grampy, but it’s with a W. A lot of people don’t know that,” the actor said. “G-W-A-M-P-Y. That’s kind of the handle I’ve been going with … It was the name [my 4-year-old granddaughter Iris] gave me.” And, honestly, sticking with the “GW” sound will probably be easier than “GR” for Jack Blues anyway.

	Earlier this month, Hailey shared a precious selfie of her and her hubby all bundled up on a walk with their infant who was strapped to Hailey’s chest. We can’t see much of the “little plump potato,” but we can see that his parents look undeniably happy.

	The new mom also included photos of products from her skincare line in the Instagram carousel, and that sent people into a tizzy. “I hope that one day Justin and their son’s image will no longer be the subject of her brand’s marketing… Justin deserves more than that!💔,” one person said. Another added, “She has to [post family pictures] to keep all you reeled in to buy her products. It’s all about marketing with them. People are such suckers.”



	It’s exactly that kind of instant negativity and mom shaming that makes us understand why parents would choose to hide their kids’ faces. And so we will retract our request to see the adorable little potato in question, and just imagine the cutie having the best first Christmas with his family and “Gwampy.”
