Is it too late now to say sorry?
Where on earth has pop superstar Justin Bieber gone? He hasn’t released any new music or performed since late 2022, and has kept things incredibly underwraps.
Despite this effort, eyebrows and concerns were raised when Hailey’s dad Stephen Baldwin posted a call for people to “pray” for Hailey and Justin Bieber on his Instagram Story. According to TMZ, Hailey was apparently displeased to see her old man airing out their personal business on his public social media. Stephen had hinted they were going through an unspecified battle, which sent alarm bells. There were also rumours he would join his former pop mentor Usher onstage during his Super Bowl halftime show last month. A source explained to Page Six Justin “wasn’t feeling it”.

Justin hasn’t performed for ages, not since he “officially postponed” his Justice World Tour in September 2022. The tour was expected to run from the latter half of that year into 2023. It had already been postponed thanks to COVID-19, but he announced halting the show after performing in Rio De Janeiro. He told fans that he was making “his health his priority” after he revealed in June 2022 that he had the rare rare neurological condition Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
According to the Mayo Clinic, it is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Mostly, it impacts over 60s who have previously had either condition. Its main symptom is paralysis of the facial nerve and Justin admitted to having “full paralysis” of the right-side of his face.

The same month, Hailey appeared on Good Morning America and gave an optimistic assessment of his progress, telling the hosts he was “doing really well” and how “grateful” she was that he was getting better. Hailey also mentioned her own health issues and how it brought them “a lot closer”. Doctors discovered that she had suffered a mini-stroke due to a blood clot in her brain.
Underfed Beliebers were given a reason to feel optimistic in summer 2023 as claims began to merge that Justin was working on new music. Apparently, he was in the studio with Skrillex, according to  The Sun. Also, speculation was growing that he was cooking up new tunes and that he could be headlining Coachella the following year if you asked TMZ. Well, the 2024 line-up includes many big names like Lana Del Rey, Sabrina Carpenter and Renee Rapp but unfortunately none are Justin Bieber!

There hasn’t been complete radio silence from the Bieber household. Hailey has been keeping fans up to date about their lives with cute snippets of their wholesome-looking lives together. These include days out in nature, Justin’s recent 30th birthday, and having a blast at the Super Bowl. On March 1, their NFL show-out put to bed the rumour of Hailey and Justin having marriage problems. Based on all this,  it’s probably better not to hold your breath and just sit back and enjoy Hailey and Justin’s cute social media updates.  Alternatively, if you’re truly nosey, cross your fingers that Stephen Baldwin specifies WHY people should pray for his daughter and her husband.
