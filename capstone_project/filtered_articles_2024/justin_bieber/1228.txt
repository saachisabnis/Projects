A former employee of Justin Bieber has spoken out about what it was like working for the pop star. 
Choreographer and dancer Emma Portner, who also happens to be the wife of actress Ellen Page, has slammed the singer for treating her poorly when she worked for him on his 2015 music video “Life Is Worth Living” and then again during his Purpose World Tour in 2016. 
In a statement recently posted on Instagram Stories, 24-year-old Porter claimed that Bieber paid her “less than minimum wage” and was degrading to women throughout their working relationship.
“I gave your universe my naive body, creativity, time and effort. Twice. For content you made millions off of. While I made zilch,” she captioned her detailed post.
Portner went on to allege that Bieber ‘barely’ paid her ‘minimum wage’ for the work she did.
“I couldn’t afford to eat. I was sweeping studio floors to be able to practice my own craft. The way you degrade women is an abomination,” she wrote.
She added:  “Your company hired an out lesbian in your music video, and to choreograph some content for your purpose world tour. How do you feel about that?”
“A lesbian, HELPING YOU, for a disrespectful amount of money, as you attend a church that goes against my existence?”
Portner, who married Juno star Page in 2018, offered to send Bieber books to “change the way your traumatized brain thinks.”
She added: “I have so much to say but mostly … I really hope you educate yourself beyond your bible.”
“You have IMMENSE power. Use it to STOP DEGRADING WOMEN.”
Justin Bieber has yet to respond.
