Hailey Bieber revealed that she has hired a private chef to prepare meals for her and Justin during her pregnancy, according to a new W Magazine cover story. The self-described “foodie” admits the chef is a “huge luxury,” but it’s the one big indulgence she allowed herself during her pregnancy. But she’s still had plenty of stress, specifically hiding her condition for so long. “I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn’t feel good,” she added. “I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life.”
Bieber also spoke about the independence she has cultivated in her own life. “I’m not super close with my family at this point in my life because I feel like I’m very independent,” Hailey said. “I’m my own individual now, and I’ve built my own family. But when I look back on my childhood and how I grew up, I have very fond, beautiful memories.” (W Magazine)
