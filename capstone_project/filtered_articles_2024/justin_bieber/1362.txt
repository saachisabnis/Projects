Justin Bieber‘s mom dug out the family photo album for the pop star’s 30th birthday. 

	“30 YEARS! Just like that. Happy birthday Justin,” Pattie Mallette, Bieber’s mother, wrote on Friday (March 1) in a caption on Instagram, where she posted several personal pictures from Bieber’s childhood.

	The photos cover a wide timeline, beginning with her pregnancy. Adorable pictures of Bieber as an infant and toddler lead the way to a current image of the singer with his birthday cake.

	“I’m not going to lie I’ve had a few good cries this week looking back through photos reminiscing,” she said. “Time goes by so fast.”

	The note continued: “It’s been amazing to see you become the man you are today @justinbieber. I’m so honored to be your mom. I love you more than you know. I can’t wait to see the great things God has planned for you ahead. You ain’t seen nothing yet!”

	










	Bieber’s wife, Hailey, also took to Instagram to celebrate her partner’s birthday on Friday.

	“30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!!” she exclaimed on Instagram, posting various pictures of the pair kissing, smiling and cuddling up to each other. “That was fast. words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life.”

	To celebrate the big 3-0, Bieber fans also got to see the unveiling of a new wax figure of the star, which is on display now at Madame Tussauds’ Hollywood Boulevard location. The wax look is modeled after how Bieber appeared in his 2021 “Peaches” music video, with a white beanie, ombre puffer jacket, pink pants and sneakers.
