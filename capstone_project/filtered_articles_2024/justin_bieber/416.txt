She’s take a walk on the wild side.
Hailey Bieber attended church with husband Justin on Wednesday night, and tripled down on animal print for the outing.
The model and new mom, 27, paired her pony hair Toteme coat ($5,700) with a matching Saint Laurent Le 5 à 7 Bea bag ($5,100).
Even her Emi Jay x Juicy Couture hair clip was covered in leopard spots.
But while Bieber’s outerwear and tote would set you back a combined five figures, she styled them with a modal cashmere Intimissimi top ($59) that retails for a fraction of the price.
Her red Adidas X Oyster Holdings Samba sneakers are also a relative deal at $130 — and although the collab’s sold out, the brand’s Samba OGs ($100) are practically identical.
Per usual, Justin went more casual, opting for a red hoodie (sans shirt), baggy black pants, a wide-brim hat and his go-to Louis Vuitton shearling boots ($2,520).
The “Yummy” singer also carried an adorable accessory: a mug decorated with the words “papa bear” and a cartoon creature.
The couple welcomed their first child together last month, only revealing the newborn’s tiny foot on Instagram. Hailey has kept a low profile since then, having been spotted out and about only a couple of times in recent weeks.
The model’s been flaunting some new bling lately, however: a diamond-studded Isa Grutman “Mom” ring ($1,980).
Earlier this week, the couple enjoyed a sushi date night at Nobu as well.
With Hailey’s maternity style spanning lace catsuits, glittering crop tops, sheer dresses and bump-baring button-up shirts, we can’t wait to see her new-mom wardrobe take shape.
