About this rating 


In early 2024, rumors circulated on social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube suggesting that Justin Bieber was releasing a new song containing the lyric, "Lost myself at a Diddy party," about rapper and producer Sean "Diddy" Combs. The posts included audio that purported to be Bieber singing. The rumor resurfaced in September 2024, following the music mogul and rapper's arrest in New York City on Sept. 16, 2024, on suspicion of sex trafficking, racketeering and other charges.
The lyrics of the song narrate a supposed experience at a party hosted by Diddy, expressing Bieber's disillusionment with fame and fortune. The opening verse contains the following lyrics:
"Lost myself at a Diddy party, didn't know that's how it go, I was in it for a new Ferrari, but it cost me way more than my soul, wasn't worth all the fortune and fame."
However, there was no concrete evidence to substantiate the existence of this song, including no official confirmation from credible sources or news outlets. Many online commenters called it out as a song generated by artificial intelligence. 
Snopes reached out to Bieber's management and record labels for comment, but received no immediate reply, as of this writing. 
On Sept. 17, 2024, federal authorities indicted the music mogul on charges related to an alleged years-long racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Diddy's arrest was connected to the March 2024 federal raids on his Miami and Los Angeles residences. 
Famously discovered at age 13 by talent manager Scooter Braun, Bieber was quickly taken under the wing of R&B singer Usher. Bieber's relationship with Diddy began when the young star was reportedly 15, with Diddy acting as his mentor and the two spending time in the recording studio together. Diddy surprised fans with Bieber's inclusion on his 2023 studio release, "The Love Album: Off the Grid," with Bieber providing guest vocals on the track "Moments." 
In recent years, Bieber has faced health challenges, including his diagnosis of temporary facial paralysis caused by Ramsay Hunt syndrome in June 2022, which led to the postponement and eventual cancellation of his "Justice World Tour" in September 2022. 
In an interview with The New York Times, published in early September 2024, singer-songwriter Michael "Mk.gee" Gordon revealed he had been collaborating musically with Bieber, with the two performers apparently writing and recording in the studio, although those musical efforts are yet to be released.
Per TMZ, Bieber was offered the headlining slot at the Coachella Festival in 2023 but declined it to focus on recording his seventh studio album, which was said to include collaborations with artists including Ed Sheeran, according to news reports. No official release date had been announced for this album as of this writing.
Following the release of his sixth studio album, "Justice," in March 2021, Bieber's only announcement on his official website regarding new music was his song with rapper Don Toliver, "Holiday," released April 2022.
Bieber interviewed his wife, model and Rhode Skin founder Hailey Bieber, for Vogue Australia in February 2023. Hinting at her husband's impending new music, Hailey said, "The new song that you just recorded, I can't stop listening to right now. Nobody knows what that is yet." However, no additional details were provided on any new songs.
While speculation regarding an alleged new Bieber song containing the lyric "Lost myself at a Diddy party" has persisted on social media, the lack of announcement or confirmation of release date on his official website or social media leads us to categorize this claim as "Unfounded." Until Bieber or his representatives address the matter, the authenticity of the alleged track remains deeply in question.
Snopes has previously reported on Bieber, including a fake photo depicting the singer waving an Israeli flag, and the true claim he no longer owns a cellphone.
