Anne Hathaway is keeping it real.
The 41-year-old Oscar winner shared a fresh-faced, makeup-selfie on Instagram Friday, with her star-shaped pimple patches front and center.
“stars, they’re just like us,” Hathaway captioned her pic.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are among the other celebs who’ve proudly showed off their Starface Hydro-Stars in public; the playfully shaped hydrocolloid patches are designed to absorb fluid, reduce redness, shrink spots and discourage picking.
“See how she use a star pimple patch instead of popping the pimple? Very demure, very mindful, very cutesy,” one fan commented on Hathaway’s post, referencing the viral TikTok trend.
“How can someone even look this beautiful in pimple patches,” another added.
Hathaway’s no stranger to spilling her beauty secrets on social media — and she’s always taken good care of her skin.
“My mom had some skin issues and my grandmother had skin cancer. So she has taught me to wear factor 30 [SPF 30] sun cream every day. I even carry an umbrella if I walk in the sunshine and use spray tan if I need to look as if I’ve been sunbathing,” the “Idea of You” actress told the Sun in 2012.
Hathaway’s longtime facialist, Su-Man, has confirmed her level of commitment, telling Net-a-Porter in 2022, “Anne is incredibly disciplined when it comes to her skin.”
Whatever she’s doing, it’s definitely working.
