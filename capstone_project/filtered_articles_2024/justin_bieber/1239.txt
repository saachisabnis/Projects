Justin Bieber loves an oversized fit. From big blazers that swamp his entire body, to crochet blankets that look like they've been knitted by (and for) an actual giant, the guy just can't get enough. Even when he's out for a jog in his jeans (because of course!) or a stroll with his fave sweatpants, they look like they're trailing about a mile or two behind him. And that's exactly what happened again in Los Angeles last night.
While hanging out with one of his mates, the Canadian superstar was spotted wearing a white T-shirt. He layered this with a cream coloured hoodie and a black leather jacket, and jumped into some grey joggers by Balenciaga.
It all seemed pretty low-key so far, right? But with Bieber being a certified freaky fashion player, every single one of these pieces was blown up. Even the furry Louis Vuitton boots on his feet looked like they were scaled up by a hundred.
It's not an aesthetic that works for everyone, but the “Peaches” singer is a ‘90s baby, and this supersized style throws it all the way back to the era of ultra baggy basketball jerseys (à la LL Cool J) and enormous jorts (from the Wu-Tang Clan). The Biebs even turned his New Era baseball cap backwards, to stick to the old school vibe.
Call it a publicity stunt. Call it weird. But this is Justin Bieber, and big fits aren't enough. They have to be XXL.
