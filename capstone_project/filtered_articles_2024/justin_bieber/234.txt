Sources open up about the couple’s feelings about becoming parents, whether they have a name, and if they’re having twins.
Shortly after Justin and Hailey Bieber announced they are expecting their first child, sources spoke to Entertainment Tonight, People, and Us Weekly about how the couple is preparing for their baby and why they kept the pregnancy secret for over six months.
Justin’s mom, Pattie Mallette, also shut down speculation that the couple is expecting twins. 
Mallette had commented on Hailey’s dad Stephen Baldwin’s Instagram about the pregnancy, writing, “Congratulations Grandpa! WE ARE GONNA HAVE THE CUTEST GRAND-BABIES EVER!”
After the plural “grand-babies” led some to believe Hailey was having twins, Mallette clarified in a second comment, “No not twins lol I wish. I just mean in general. Hopefully they will have more than one eventually. They will make beautiful babies whenever they have them. One is enough for now 😂”
Hailey’s rep confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that Hailey is “a little over six months pregnant.”
A source told the outlet that “Hailey and Justin are thrilled to be expecting a baby together. They have wanted this for a long time and can’t wait to expand their family and bring a child into the world. Hailey and Justin are united and have been on the same page when it comes to parenthood. They have experienced so much together as a couple and feel ready to take this next step in their lives and relationship.
“Hailey is such a natural caretaker and Justin knows she will be the best mom, and Hailey has always thought that Justin will make an amazing dad. Hailey, Justin, their families and loved ones are so excited for this beautiful blessing.”
Justin and Hailey’s history goes way back to 2009. Read about how the couple became friends, dated, broke up, then got back together.
In her ELLE 2021 cover story, Hailey spoke about her life during the COVID-19 pandemic and her marriage to Justin two years in.
In her 2020 ELLE cover story, the then-newlywed opened up about her faith and loving Justin in sickness and in health.
A source told People that the couple already has a name picked out, and Justin in particular will be very hands-on. “Everyone is excited for them,” the source said. “They will be great parents, and Justin will be super involved. This will be the next important project for him. He’s so excited to raise his baby. They have a name that they think is perfect. They’re also starting to decorate a nursery. They can’t wait to meet the baby.”
The source also explained why they kept the news private for as long as they did. “They have both been very emotional about it. They feel so blessed,” the source said. “They’ve also felt very protective of the baby from the moment they found out. They shared with family and close friends early on. It was very important for them to keep it quiet and just enjoy [it] for as long as possible before they publicly confirmed.”
A source described this moment to Us Weekly as a “fresh start” for the couple, who just renewed their wedding vows five years into marriage.
“[They] have gone through hard times recently,” the source said, adding, “this feels like the light at the end of the tunnel.”
The insider added, “It was everything they needed. Hailey is feeling really good. She has been laying low and trying not to overdo it with her work commitments. They decided to renew their vows to embrace a new chapter together. They wanted to renew and restore their faith in God together, and in their relationship. It was a new commitment and a fresh start for them as a family of three.”
