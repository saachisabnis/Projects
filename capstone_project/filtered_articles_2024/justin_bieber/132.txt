A Rhode Island couple turned a chance discovery into a symbol of their love story, culminating in a wedding filled with heartfelt moments and dreams of a Parisian honeymoon.
Ken Steinkamp and Sandy Sikorski stumbled upon an unexpected treasure while dining at a Westerly, Rhode Island, restaurant on December 27, 2021. Sandy tasted something peculiar in her clam-a pearl.
Charmed by its uniqueness, Ken transformed it into a stunning engagement ring, encasing it in 18-karat gold and embellishing it with diamonds. Their engagement on July 6, 2023, marked the beginning of a remarkable journey.
Sikorski donned a strapless gown adorned with crystals during her wedding day that featured lace detail at the hem, describing it as elegant yet weighty throughout the evening.
During the ceremony, the couple's unique clam-made ring often catches attention, becoming a frequent topic of admiration due to its beauty, as Sikorski mentioned receiving numerous compliments despite strangers being unaware of its origin.
On April 14, just over nine months later, Ken and Sandy exchanged vows in an intimate ceremony at Avondale Chapel in Westerly.
Their love for pearls extended to their wedding details, with a pearl-themed cake and pearl-adorned shoes for Sandy's granddaughter. Sandy radiated elegance in a crystal-studded gown, embodying the spirit of their special day.
Despite a stormy day, the couple's wedding unfolded with heartwarming moments. Sandy's brother ensured her safe passage to the chapel, embodying family support and love.
Furthermore, her 93-year-old father, Louis Bald, defied health challenges to walk her down the aisle, symbolizing enduring familial bonds.
Despite his own health challenges, he was determined to walk his daughter down the aisle, and although there were uncertainties until just days before, they had arrangements in place with a CNA as a precaution.
With the CNA ready in the back row, he managed to walk with a cane, a practice he had done before the wedding to ensure comfort.
His daughter expressed gratitude for his determination and described him as a trooper throughout the event.
Steinkamp said, "I think I hung on to him." "He was a trooper. He did great."
