Group looks to bring ‘fresh perspective and energy to iconic music education brand’

Just one year after opening, School of Rock Kent has new owners ready to “aim to bring a fresh perspective and energy to this iconic music education brand.”
School of Rock, 445 Ramsay Way, Suite 104 at the Kent Station shopping center, features programs for all ages. Students learn theory and techniques by performing music from legendary artists such as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Frank Zappa.
“This hands-on approach builds not only technical skill but also the confidence to shine on stage,” according to a Dec. 6 School of Rock press release. “Many graduates have gone on to successful careers in music, including appearances on “American Idol,” “The Voice” and Broadway.”



The new owners are Joshila and Chris Wilson, Phil Gustavson and veteran franchise operators Bob Gustavson and Bruce Hogarth, who are from School of Rock West Seattle. Aaron Rossler previously owned the store that opened in October 2023.
Meet the owners
• Joshila Wilson, originally from New Zealand, began her artistic journey with dance and evolved into a deep commitment to creativity and education, according to the press release. Now a resident of Auburn and a member of the Auburn School District, she combines her love for the arts with a desire to help individuals of all ages realize their potential. She sees this new venture as a chance to strengthen the community through music and personal growth.
• Chris Wilson has spent the last 24 years touring the globe as a production rigger, working with iconic artists like Linkin Park, Green Day, Michael Bublé, The Weeknd and many more. His career reflects a deep passion for music and live performances. Beyond his technical expertise, he is dedicated to inspiring young musicians, fostering their confidence and helping them discover their own creative passions through live music. His work embodies a blend of skill, mentorship and love for the industry.
• Phil Gustavson has nearly a decade of experience as a School of Rock franchise operator, and he has been a cornerstone of Seattle’s music education scene. As a performer, teacher and sound engineer, he has mentored thousands of musicians and organized hundreds of concerts. His impressive background spans punk rock, jazz manouche and executive production at renowned studios. He actively contributes to community events as an executive board member of the Alki Art Fair.
