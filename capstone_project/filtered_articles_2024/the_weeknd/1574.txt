Sorry Justin Bieber, there's a new favorite Canadian in town.
According to a study conducted by CanadaCasino.ca, the world's most popular Canadian celebrity is no longer the "Yummy" singer, but instead Ryan Reynolds, who is from Vancouver, British Columbia. The 47-year-old actor was even awarded the Order of British Columbia by his home province in 2023, a civilian honor of merit recognizing one who has "served with the greatest distinction and excelled in any field of endeavor benefiting the people of British Columbia and beyond," per the government's website.
The Deadpool star received more than 4 million global monthly Google searches and his Wikipedia page was viewed over 62 million times. Bieber did, however receive about 2 million more monthly Google searches than Reynolds but around 9 million fewer Wikipedia page views. Even more good news for the Biebs â€” he's still the most popular celebrity in his birthplace of Ontario. 
Other notable celebs on the list include actors such as Ryan Gosling and Michael J. Fox, musicians like Shawn Mendes and Drake and political leaders like Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. 
These are the 10 most popular Canadians in 2024, according to CanadaCasino.ca:
