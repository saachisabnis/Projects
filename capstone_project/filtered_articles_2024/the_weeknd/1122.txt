The Weeknd and Playboi Carti have reunited for their newest single, “Timeless.”
Clocking in at over four minutes, the track features production work from Pharrell, Ojivolta, Mike Dean and Twisco. “Timeless” fuses Carti’s subtle rap style with the XO Records head’s melodic chops, resulting in a sultry and cohesive offering that brings out the best of both artists. The track marks the pair’s second collaboration in recent history following The Idol soundtrack cut “Popular” with Madonna, and it was first debuted live during The Weeknd’s one-off show in Brazil in early September.
“Timeless” is expected to appear on The Weeknd’s upcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow, which will round out his album trilogy comprised of After Hours and Dawn FM.  “Yesterday was fourteen years ago… we held our breath falling into a shimmering sea in the after hours of the night. Attempted to cleanse the wounds with melodies and lights, a bulletproof bandage to shield what lies beneath,” his album announcement read. “In a place where the seasons never changed, where time ceased to exist. But therein lays the problem. Today has felt like an endless spin. I keep distorting the truth, immune to dizziness, numb to the nausea. What lies beneath-screams in silence. I look in the mirror and feel both old and new, stuck in limbo and unable to move. I still haven’t faced myself.”
