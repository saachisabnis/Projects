Diamond-certified global superstar The Weeknd has announced an exclusive one-night-only stadium show in São Paulo, Brazil, on Saturday, September 7, 2024, at Estádio MorumBIS. This highly anticipated performance will feature never-before-seen production elements, promising an unforgettable experience for fans.
Produced by Live Nation, this show follows The Weeknd’s record-breaking 2022/2023 After Hours Til Dawn Tour, which achieved phenomenal success across North America, Europe, the UK, and Latin America.
