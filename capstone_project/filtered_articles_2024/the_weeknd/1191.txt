Hurry Up Tomorrow shares its title with The Weeknd's upcoming album
A new film produced by Abel 'The Weeknd' Tesfaye is set to star Barry Keoghan and Jenna Ortega alongside the artist himself.
Hurry Up Tomorrow shares its title with – and is inspired by – the artist's forthcoming album, which is due out in January. The film is described as a "musically-driven psychological thriller" and will get its North American release on 16th May. Directed by Trey Edward Shults, it's produced by The Weeknd and his company Manic Phase.
In addition to music by The Weeknd himself, Hurry Up Tomorrow will feature additional soundtracking from the artist's frequent collaborator, Daniel Lopatin, AKA Oneohtrix Point Never. 
'Hurry Up Tomorrow', the album, is the third in a trilogy of LPs that started with 2020's 'After Hours' and then took in 2022's 'Dawn FM'. It's set for release on 24th January. Singles released so far have included 'São Paulo' featuring Anitta and 'Dancing In The Flames'. 
Earlier this year, The Weeknd donated $2.5 million via his XO Humanitarian Fund to pay for emergency meals in Gaza.
