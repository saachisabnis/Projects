The Weeknd has pledged $2 million to provide food aid in Gaza, where Palestinians are facing near-famine conditions.
The United Nations World Food Programme has recently announced that a well-known artist has made a generous donation to cover the cost of 1,500 metric tons of fortified wheat flour. This amount is enough to make over 18 million loaves of bread, which will feed more than 157,000 Palestinians for a month. The announcement was made on Monday through an official news release.
“With famine looming in Gaza, [The Weeknd’s] generous support will provide vital relief for thousands of Palestinian families who battle the grip of hunger every day,” Corinne Fleischer, the World Food Programme’s director for the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe Region, said in a statement.
“We are tremendously grateful for his contribution, compassion, and for his unwavering advocacy for WFP and the people of Palestine.”
