why is ponytail catching strays? üò≠
this tired ass conspiracy theory
there is literally no need to be writing dissertations defending Sabrina Carpenter against a couple of comments saying she shouldn‚Äôt be eligible for best new artist. that is not hate. i honestly don‚Äôt care whether she‚Äôs eligible or not, but the Victoria comparison does not work when Jaguar II was her debut studio album and first release under a major record label. i know Sabrina has had struggles but that‚Äôs just bad luck
i will say Victoria got a little lucky with her eligibility, but she certainly qualifies as ‚Äònew‚Äô more than Sabrina
Yes I‚Äôm sure of all people that Scooter Braun would want to sabotage it would be The Weeknd and not Taylor.
I don't even have my lorazepam, I'm going to have to DRINK myself to sleep

Billie agenda is working hard.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.

Something did happen behind the scene in pop field that year. Scooter was acting weird
Sexy, confident. So intelligent.
She is heaven-sent. So soft, so strong.

nothing weird happened in pop that didn‚Äôt happen in the GF also, where Scooter‚Äôs clients were not nominated
the weeknd snub is still quite shocking but people connecting Scooter to it is absurd and just strange
we should have seen Justin‚Äôs pop nominations coming. he is a big pop namecheck and ‚ÄòChanges‚Äô did not perform that badly despite the negative reception
people kept predicting Post Malone in best pop vocal album but it‚Äôs clear that pop just don‚Äôt like him and even in his prime he couldn‚Äôt really compete with pop favourites like Bieber and Gaga
Honey, Little Monsters can make all the excuses they want.  The reality is, Lady Gaga has been on a decline for years.  Her next album is a flop in the making.  Girlfriend will NOT be a legitimate Grammy contender.
Gaga has literally been releasing grammy winning album after grammy winning album since 2014, her last album to miss a grammy win was ARTPOP ten years ago, since then it‚Äôs been 5 albums in a row winning
I liked Rauw Alejandro‚Äôs new video for ‚ÄúTouching The Sky‚Äù. Felt like a homage to Uptown Funk. I liked everything, from his dance moves, down to the outfits, cute haircut and beard style. This new fruitier Alejandro is üî•, smash, next question. 
Jokes aside, he‚Äôd probably be moved to pop, unless the Latin panel pull a Tyla.
Definitely a VMA contender for Choreography. 
Typically, the winner of Best Pop Vocal Album  has had to have a significant impact (Era) during their album cycle, with multiple hits and singles, numerous performances, appearances, music videos, and extensive radio play. Nowadays, this tends to weigh more heavily than critical acclaim (as seen with Midnights winning over Guts, Harrys House winning over 30, Sour over Happier Then Ever and so on fourth). 
Currently, Ariana seems to have it in the bag, and there‚Äôs a good chance in Pop Solo Performance as well, especially considering the amount of exposure she will get within the Voting Period with Wicked. Similarly to how Gaga won Pop Solo Performance in 2019 due to her exposure with A Star Is Born.

I think Abel‚Äôs snub and Bieber‚Äôs nominations were completely different things.
Scooter pulling influence doesn‚Äôt seem very surprising to me seeing the 2022 blind ballot voting for Justin (and Laroi) everywhere. There are people who support him not ironically.
But seeing as The Weeknd didn‚Äôt make it to Pop on a straight up ballot, maybe he was unfortunately ranked 7 or 8 on the GF and was easily replaced by Black Pumas or Julia Michaels
It's me... Hi
