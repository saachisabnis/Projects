The Weeknd’s new album will be titled Hurry Up Tomorrow. In a teaser, Abel Tesfaye presents the Dawn FM follow-up, which does not yet have a release date, as the conclusion of a trilogy—a framing he has been teasing since Dawn FM. Text in the trailer reads, “This album represents the creative apex of the project, serving as the third and final chapter crafted with existential and self-referential themes as seen with the latest visionary teasers that have set fans ablaze with anticipation for this concluding installment.” Watch it in full below.
After announcing the end of his After Hours era with “Take My Breath,” Tesfaye revealed Dawn FM just a few days before its arrival. Since its release, Swedish House Mafia have remixed “Sacrifice” and worked with the singer on “Moth to a Flame.” Tesfaye has also collaborated on songs with FKA twigs, Post Malone, and Rosalía, and been on a posthumous release from Aaliyah. There was also, of course, The Idol.
The Weeknd is due to play a one-night-only concert in São Paulo this Saturday (September 7).
