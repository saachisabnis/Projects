If you’re a fan of Future X Metro Boomin, you won’t want to miss their ongoing ‘We Trust You Tour.’
However, you will need to hurry.

That includes a stop at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Thursday, Aug. 15.
The good news is that tickets are available for all upcoming, ahem, future Future gigs.
Some are quite affordable, too.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on seats for any one show was $50 before fees on Vivid Seats.
Other ‘We Trust You’ concerts have tickets starting anywhere from $54 before fees to $200 after fees.

On April 12, Future and Metro Boomin dropped their electric two-disc album “We Don’t Trust You.”
Comprised of 25 tracks, the record is a showcase for Metro Boomin’s glittery production and Future’s impeccable flow.
After a few listens, we were wowed by the trippy “Jealous,” soaring “Right 4 You” and blissed out “Gracious.”
However, our team couldn’t stop coming back to the hypnotic, retro-futuristic sound of the album opener “We Still Don’t Trust You” featuring The Weeknd. Listen once and you’ll come back for more, too; a single spin simply does not suffice with music this catchy.
Want to give the record a whirl?
You can find “We Don’t Trust You” in its glorious entirety here.
