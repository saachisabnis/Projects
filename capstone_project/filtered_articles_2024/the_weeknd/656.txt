The Weeknd has posted a haunting music trailer.
After recently providing fans with a two-minute preview of new music, Abel Tesfaye has shared a clip of an animated little boy, seemingly left abandoned, outside in the garden of an empty house in a thunderstorm. “Unprepared certainty…” the social media video is captioned.
“I’ve been losing my memories,” the “Blinding Lights” hitmaker sings in the trailer.
Ahead of a one-off concert in São Paulo, Brazil, where the 34-year-old singer is set to debut a brand-new production that will differ from his “After Hours Til Dawn Tour” of 2022 and 2023, the “Die For You” singer recently posted a cinematic trailer.
The gig takes place on September 7, at the Estádio MorumBIS soccer stadium.
Ticket prices include a $1 donation to The Weeknd’s XO Humanitarian Fund, which provides food and support to those in poverty, in partnership with the United Nations.
The “Popular” hitmaker has been cryptically teasing the third album in his After Hours/Dawn FM trilogy, which will mark his sixth studio album.
Last June, he teased that the title would be unveiled “soon.”
“I’m finishing the third part of this saga, of this trilogy. The name of it will come out soon, but it’s not called what some fans think it’s called… What they think it’s called is actually a song on the album, but that’s not what the actual album is called. [It’s unclear which speculative title he’s referring to.] So I’m just gonna say that,” the “Double Fantasy” star told Variety.
