With the announcement of the iPhone 16 lineup, The Weeknd has added another exciting reveal: his latest single, “Dancing in the Flames,” the lead track from his upcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. As part of this highly anticipated release, The Weeknd has debuted a groundbreaking music video, filmed entirely on the new iPhone 16 Pro, and directed by frequent collaborator Anton Tammi alongside director of photography Erik Henrikkson.
The music video, which showcases the iPhone 16 Pro’s cutting-edge capabilities, was shot in 4K 120fps and Dolby Vision, pushing the boundaries of what smartphone cameras can do. In a behind-the-scenes clip, which premiered at Apple’s It’s Glowtime event, Henrikkson praised the iPhone 16 Pro, noting that the device is beginning to “erase the line between what’s considered a ‘professional camera’ and what’s not.” He added, “I was blown away by how the iPhone picked up the strong highlights and deep blacks, especially with the bright HDMI backlights hitting the rain in the shot. The contrast management was exceptional, and it looked amazing on The Weeknd’s face.”
“Dancing in the Flames” arrives with stunning visuals, enhanced by the iPhone 16’s ability to handle complex lighting setups. The video is filled with rich contrasts, vibrant colors, and dynamic scenes, making it an impressive showcase for the new smartphone’s filmmaking potential. The release of this video is particularly exciting for young filmmakers, as it demonstrates the powerful capabilities of the iPhone 16 Pro and how accessible professional-quality production tools have become.
This new single and its accompanying video are also significant as they mark the beginning of the end for The Weeknd’s After Hours and Dawn FM trilogy. Described as the third and final chapter, Hurry Up Tomorrow promises to deliver the dark, moody atmospheres and cinematic flair that fans have come to expect from the Canadian superstar.
