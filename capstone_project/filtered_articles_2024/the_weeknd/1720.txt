“Starboy” is the title track of the 33-year-old’s third studio album, which was released in 2016 to critical acclaim. It debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the Grammy Awards and has since been certified four-times platinum by the RIAA.
With his latest achievement, the Pop/R&B titan has become the first artist to have more than one song garner over 3 billion plays on the Swedish music platform.
Last month, The Weeknd broke yet another Spotify record with his 2020 megahit, “Blinding Lights.” According to a press release sent out in mid-January, the Max Martin-produced joint from After Hours became the first song to cross over four billion streams on the app.
“I’ll never stop being humbled by anything I create making its way to millions of people let alone billions!” the superstar wrote in a statement. “I’m so thankful this song makes people feel a way that they keep going back to listen.”
