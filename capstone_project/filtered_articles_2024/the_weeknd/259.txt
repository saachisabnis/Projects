The Weeknd shared “Dancing In The Flames,” the lead single from his forthcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow. The single arrived with an Anton Tammi-directed music video shot entirely on the iPhone 16 Pro. 
Abel Tesfaye has hinted Hurry Up Tomorrow will be his final album or at least the last put out under The Weeknd moniker. A release date has not been announced for an LP that completes a trilogy started with 2020’s After Hours and continued with 2022’s Dawn FM. 
Apple unveiled the iPhone 16 line earlier this week during an event held in Cupertino, California. The 16 Pro can record in 4K 120fps in Dolby Vision for smooth slo-motion video capture, a feature showcased in the “Dancing In The Flames” video. Erik Henriksson, the video’s director of photography, said the new iPhone “is starting to erase the line” between everyday devices and “professional” cameras. 
The Weeknd will perform at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 21. The set is currently expected to be the only 2024 The Weeknd performance in North America.
