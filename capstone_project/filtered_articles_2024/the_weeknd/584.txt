Billie Eilish is now officially recognized as Spotify‘s most streamed monthly artist. The streaming platform announced their new monthly leader on Monday (August 19), with Eilish replacing the Weeknd at the top of Spotify’s monthly streaming list. Eilish was obviously blown away by the streaming record and appreciative of the support of her fans. She shared the Spotify news on Instagram, and captioned her post, “number 1 in the world on spotify i really can’t even believe this. i love you all so much this is the craziest thing ever.” 
With Eilish passing the 100 million monthly listener plateau in June 2024, she becomes only the third artist in history – and the youngest artist ever – to accomplish that streaming feat, following both the Weeknd and Taylor Swift. Eilish currently has eight songs in Spotify’s Billions Club, which recognizes tracks that have surpassed one billion total streams: “Lovely,” “Bad Guy,” “When the Party’s Over,” “Everything I Wanted,” “Ocean Eyes,” “Happier Than Ever,” “Idontwannabeyouanymore,” and “Bury a Friend.” (Billboard)
