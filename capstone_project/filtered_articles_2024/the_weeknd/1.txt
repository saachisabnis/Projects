The Weeknd — who is one of the biggest-selling stars on the planet — is set to debut a brand-new production that will differ from his “After Hours Til Dawn Tour” of 2022 and 2023.
The gig takes place on Sept. 7, at the Estádio MorumBIS soccer stadium in Sao Paulo.
Ticket prices will include a $1 donation to The Weeknd’s XO Humanitarian Fund, which provides food and support to those in poverty in partnership with the United Nations.
The “Popular” hitmaker — whose real name is Abel Tesfaye — has been cryptically teasing the third album in his After Hours/Dawn FM trilogy, which will mark his sixth studio album.
Among the posts were pictures of his silhouettes with the words, “Pain, regret, rebirth.”
Last June, The Weeknd teased that the title would be unveiled “soon.”
“I’m finishing the third part of this saga, of this trilogy,” the “Double Fantasy” star told Variety. “The name of it will come out soon, but it’s not called what some fans think it’s called … what they think it’s called is actually a song on the album, but that’s not what the actual album is called. [It’s unclear which speculative title he’s referring to.] So, I’m just gonna say that.”
The Weeknd loved how intimate the shows on his tour felt.
“The performances are mostly in the daytime, so I get to see the audience,” he said. “It’s easier to connect with their eyes and feels a bit more intimate. So, instead of a performance, it feels like more of a conversation with them. Every night, I’m changing up the set — I never do that; it’s usually very formulaic — so I’m spicing it up and going into deep, deep, deep cuts and older songs. I’ll rehearse it the day of. If the band is down, we’ll just throw a mini-set in there.”
