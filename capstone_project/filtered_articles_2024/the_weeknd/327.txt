It’s always fun to find out what was popular the year you were born, from books to movies to songs. As you weren’t sentient enough to enjoy that content at the time, though, it can’t exactly evoke nostalgia for the early days of your life. What probably can transport you into your own past is whatever music topped the charts during formative teen milestones—say, the grand finale of your high school career. 
To that end, we’ve compiled a list of the most popular songs from every graduation season between 1960 and 2023. The methodology is simple: For each year, we identified the song that spent the most weeks at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during May and June. The runner-up is the song (or, often, songs) with the second highest number of weeks at no 1. during those two months. 
The result is an eclectic journey through pop music that starts with The Everly Brothers and Del Shannon and deposits you at the doorsteps of Drake and BTS. It turns out that Paul McCartney is the MVP of graduation season song charts: He and his associated acts made the list five times (not including appearances as runner-up).
Selecting your high school graduation year (or any year) in the rundown below will take you to its full entry in the list, where you can listen to the winner and find out which other single or singles came in second place. Again, the stats you’ll see are not the total number of weeks a song was ever at no. 1—just the weeks that fall in May and June, when kids are typically graduating from high school.
