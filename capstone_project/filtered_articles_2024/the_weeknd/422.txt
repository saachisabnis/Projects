The Weeknd (born Abel Tesfaye) has gone back to the future and interviewed a younger version of himself generated by artificial intelligence.
In a collaboration with fashion brand SSENSE that launched on Tuesday (June 11), the singer chatted with a 10-year-old replica of himself.

After his AI likeness revealed that he liked listening to music and singing, he asked The Weeknd how his life was treating him.
The adult, living version of Tesfaye said, “You have a lot to look forward to,” before asking: “How is your relationship with God?”

The kid responded: “God is like my super cool friend who’s always there, you know?”
After the AI version of The Weeknd revealed that his super power is creating worlds in his head, he asked the 34-year-old singer what his super power is.

“Probably being focused,” Tesfaye replied. “And a new power is my patience.”
The project is the result of “reconfiguring his body with Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD and uploading his former self to an OpenAI GPT,” according to the article.
Much of The Weeknd’s focus seems to be on the future these days.
Earlier this month, he teased a potential new collaboration with the tech giant Apple, but he didn’t give away too many details.

The “I Can’t Feel My Face” singer posted a photo full of framed pictures of the Apple logo on the wall above a white couch, implying that he was at the company’s headquarters.
His caption only comprised the googly-eyed emoji, the musical-notes emoji and the film camera emoji, all of which suggested that he’d be recording and taping a new music performance.

However, that has not been confirmed, as of this writing.
Late last month, The Weeknd shared another social media post that had fans speculating about the “end” of his career.
The singer took to his Instagram Story where he quoted a fan page’s tweet about his live performance of his blockbuster single “Save Your Tears” at the 2021 Billboard Awards. The TV hit saw him walking along a road while singing as rows of cars came up behind him, parting ways right before they hit him.

“There was a lot of trust with those cars,” read the quote. “He didn’t seem nervous at all, which really weirded us out, because these cars were just barreling by him and he was calm, kept his composure, walked slow and just didn’t look back. It was kind of amazing.”
The Instagram Story post included a static shot from the performance as well as the statement, “the end is near.”
