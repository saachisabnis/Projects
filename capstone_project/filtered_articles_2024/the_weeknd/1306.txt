With a new album on the horizon, The Weeknd is pulling out all the stops for his latest rollout. The musician’s latest endeavor arrives in the form of his long-awaited collaboration with Apple, initially announced back in July when the tech giant announced its imminent lineup of Immersive Video series for its Apple Vision Pro. Four months later and The Weeknd’s first-of-its-kind streaming endeavor is officially here, confirmed to land on devices everywhere later this week.
Per a press release, the experience – entitled The Weeknd: Open Hearts – marks the first immersive music experience captured in Apple Immersive Video, and utilizes “a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages ultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place viewers in the center of the action.”
Directed by Anton Tammi, the audiovisual experience is also available to stream on an Apple Vision Pro beginning November 14, or via demo at a local Apple Store beginning November 15.
