The Weeknd is set to stream his one-night-only concert in São Paulo, Brazil, live on YouTube for fans worldwide. 
The event, produced by Live Nation, will take place on September 7 at Estádio Morumbi, featuring his biggest hits and a preview of what’s next in his career. The concert will be available to stream on his YouTube channel starting at 8 p.m. ET.
In a statement, the Weeknd expressed his excitement about the live stream, saying it allows him to connect with fans globally in real-time, even if he can’t visit every city. Additionally, 10 percent of the net proceeds from merch sales at the concert and online will be donated to the Brazilian Soul Fund, supporting local families affected by natural disasters.
“I’m so excited to announce that we’ll be live streaming my show from São Paulo, Brazil, so everyone around the world can be a part of this special night,” said the Weeknd in a statement. “I wish I could come to every city and town on earth, but moments like this give us the chance to connect in real time at least and share that energy together, no matter where you are.”
After his Brazil performance, the Weeknd will head to Australia to continue his After Hours Til Dawn tour, with shows in Melbourne on October 5-6 and in Sydney on October 22-23. The tour, which began in July 2022, was initially scheduled to include 11 shows in Australia and New Zealand last year but was postponed to this year due to unforeseen circumstances.
Fans can expect the possibility of new material during the show, as the Weeknd has been teasing new music on social media. The album’s title remains a secret, but he revealed to Variety last year that he is working on the third installment in a trilogy following “After Hours” and “Dawn FM”.
