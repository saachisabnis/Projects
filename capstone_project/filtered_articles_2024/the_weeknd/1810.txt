Travis Scott will be returning to the stage at Saturday Night Live, set to perform for the second time in his career.
The official SNL account took to Twitter early Sunday morning (March 10) to reveal the news.

The post read: “March 30!!! Ramy Youssef [and] Travis Scott.”
This will be Scott’s first time performing on the show since he stopped by in 2018 to perform songs from ASTROWORLD alongside special guests Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and John Mayer.
Scott will be following in the footsteps of some pretty epic SNL performances from earlier this year.
Back in February, 21 Savage made his Saturday Night Live debut, which featured a pair of ballerinas, a violinist, classically trained vocalist singing in Portuguese, and appearances by Brent Faiyaz and Summer Walker.

The Atlanta rapper took the stage to perform “redrum” and a blend of “should’ve wore a bonnet” and “prove it,” all of which are on his new album American Dream.
The first performance found two singers recreating the sample pulled from Brazilian singer Elza Laranjeira’s “Serenata Do Adeus,” which appears on “redrum.”

The performances of “bonnet” and “prove it” were highlighted by Faiyaz and Walker, respectively.
Travis Scott has been keeping his live performance chops fresh lately, having stopped by Mike Dean‘s March show in Los Angeles alongside The Weeknd, who blessed fans with an unreleased song.

Earlier this month, Dean put on a special birthday show at the Wiltern Theater. There, the producer teamed up with the “I Can’t Feel My Face” performer to drop a cover of “In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song),” the David Lynch/Peter Ivers track from Lynch’s movie Eraserhead.
The Weeknd also performed “Take Me Back To LA,” which was first performed in 2020 and is a fan favorite during live shows, but has yet to be officially released.

Meanwhile, Travis Scott performed “Fe!n,” then teamed up with Mike Dean and The Weeknd for “Circus Maximus.”
While it seems likely that the “SICKO MODE” rapper will be performing songs from his 2023 album UTOPIA during his SNL set, he did tease some new music back in February.

Though he didn’t share when it will be dropping, he did make it clear that he’s excited for what the future holds. “I love music so fucking much. And for the record. We will [be] backkkkkk. I gotta kick [into] a new gear since they think it’s play time,” he wrote.
He continued: “Whole cactus gang are snappers,” suggesting that the new music may feature collaborations with fellow Cactus Gang rappers.
