Along with his latest achievement, The Weeknd also received three new RIAA certifications. He earned one for the Starboy album going six times platinum. Also, he received certifications for the “Starboy” song going 15 times platinum, and “I Feel It Coming” going 8x Platinum Song. 
The Weekend is closing out the year in grand fashion by making major moves. Recently, he announced that his album Hurry Up Tomorrow would be released on January 24, 2025. The project will be his last album under his current stage name. It will be his first full-length album since he dropped Dawn FM in 2022.
The Weeknd will be staging a “massive one-night-only live stadium show” held at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California a day after the project drops. Also, he signed a new distribution deal for the film version of the album to be shown in theaters.
In November, Lionsgate purchased the rights to the film. It’s set to be an extension of The Weeknd‘s upcoming album of the same title. The film will mark The Weeknd’s film debut.
