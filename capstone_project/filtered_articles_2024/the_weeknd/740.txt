while i’m sure voters do look at the lyrics when voting for SOTY, let’s not forget they nominated ABCDEFU 2 years ago
I’m gonna blame that on a weak playing field because how the F did any academy members over 18 years old vote for THAT?!
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
As someone new to Grammy predicting, what is the thought process when predicting a song for one of SOTY or ROTY, but not both? 
In SOTY there is a greater benefit from the alphabetical advantage (according to song titles).
ROTY tends to be more mainstream while in SOTY niche choices are more frequent (see Just Like That).
R&B projects seem to have a greater opening in ROTY, even if they are not very popular.
Sometimes narrative or storytelling helps to occupy a place in SOTY (often social messages).
It's me... Hi
I hope Taylor Swift releases the first lead single off next album with a title like “Zoom Meeting” if voters are really that lazy to not read through their ballots

 This is step 1 for Rachel Chinouriri to get a BNA nom 
Neeeeeeed her to surprise and sneak in
Get real!  Voters do NOT look at lyrics for Song of the Year.  Pure delusion.  They just vote for what they like (see “Single Ladies” and “That’s What I Like”).
I mean, What Was I Made For won SOTY while Flowers got ROTY. They clearly picked the first one because of the message. In the last few years voters seem to understand better what each category is about.

lol Gooch, I will battle you and say “Single Ladies” is well-written song. That’s an iconic track.
Bruno just had narrative; it was his time. Definitely didn’t deserve SOTY for that song though. Perfect example of lazy voting

In the rulebook for next year’s awards, I see that there’s this under “Entry Limits” on page 16:
“The Online Entry Process is programmed such that it 1) limits entries in genre (excluding General
Field and Craft Categories) Categories to one per recording for albums; and 2) limits track/single
entries to one for performance Categories, and one for song/composition Categories.”

Those two are exactly why I used Espresso vs Not Like Us, tbh. The better written song vs the better produced song

she would’ve been snubbed with evermore if it wasn’t for the last minute category expansion.
voters did not scroll down to “willow” in SOTY. usually she gets easy name-check nominations in songwriting categories.
With 200k more streams than the #2 album, 31 songs vs 10 songs, it’s not the flex that you think it is
the album has been out for over two months. You need to stop being blinded by your hatred glasses. TTPD is an undeniable smash on all metrics. You need to give it a rest. The album is being consumed whether you like it or not.
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
let’s not forget they nominated ABCDEFU 2 years ago
If only alphabetical advantage benefitted songs like American Teenager and Escapism rather than songs like abcdefu and Bad Habits (Ed Sheeran)

honestly if only alphabetical advantage benefitted ethel cain in general.
also bad habits wasn’t, and still isn’t, actually THAT bad.
(edit : i thought this was the steve lacy song. the ed one sucks.)
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
If only alphabetical advantage benefitted songs like American Teenager and Escapism rather than songs like abcdefu and Bad Habits
BTW, I had no idea Fred again.. (Fred Gibson) shared a songwriting nomination for Bad Habits

Oh, cool. I think Chappell will be listed under “R”. If she isn’t, I should probably add her as well.
