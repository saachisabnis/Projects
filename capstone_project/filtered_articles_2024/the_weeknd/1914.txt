The Weeknd has officially confirmed the upcoming release of his new collaboration with Playboi Carti. Titled “TIMELESS,” the singer has taken to Instagram to announce that it will be announcing soon. 
The two have performed the song before in a one night performance in Sao Paolo earlier this month. The Weeknd confirmed that “TIMELESS” would be coming out on September 27, marking the second official release from the Canadian crooner’s forthcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. The first single, which The Weeknd revealed that he shot the entire music video on the new iPhone 16 Pro, has been well-received by fans. 
Carti had recently released a new single, “ALL RED” for his upcoming project. The rapper has been relatively low-key since he launched Whole Lotta Red in 2020. Previously, The Weeknd and Carti collaborated on “Popular” which was part of The Idol soundtrack. Take a look at the teaser below.
