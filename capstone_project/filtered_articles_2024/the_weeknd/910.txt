“I opened up for him on the U.S. tour last summer,” he explained. “That came about during a livestream. I was doing a little livestream on Instagram, and Abel was tuned in. And he texted me during the livestream, like, ‘You should just open for me.'”
He continued: “I get to go out, have a budget, get production, and make shit look cool.”
The comments about The Weeknd begin at the 5:00 minute mark.
