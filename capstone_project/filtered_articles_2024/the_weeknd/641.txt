Metro Boomin and The Weeknd‘s prolific partnership isn’t coming to an end anytime soon.
In an interview with Spotify’s RapCaviar ahead of his recent show in Egypt, the multi-platinum producer revealed that he and the Canadian crooner are working on new music for the latter’s upcoming album.

In a video shared on the platform’s Instagram page, he said: “Me and him working on a lot of stuff. You know, we cookin’ up for his new album. A lot of people gonna be real pleased and even more happier.”
Metro also spoke about his rich collaborative relationship with The Weeknd: “The songs we did with The Weeknd, frequent collaborator of mine. ‘Low Life’ was the beginning of our journey, to now, which was with Future.

“I feel like it was just a full circle moment for him to appear between the two albums, like four times? That’s big. That’s family.”
The two albums Metro was referring to are We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, his back-to-back joint projects with Future that were released in March and April, respectively.
Metro Boomin and The Weeknd have connected plenty of times in recent years, including on “Creepin'” from Metro’s Heroes & Villains and “All To Myself” from WE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU, where the singer joined in on taking shots at Drake.
On the song, Abel Tesfaye sang: “These n-ggas always yappin’, yeah/ I promise that I got your back/ Ooh, look at how we movin’, baby/ They could never diss my brothers, baby/ When they got leaks in they operation/ I thank God that I never signed my life away/ And we never do the big talk/ They shooters makin’ TikToks/ Got us laughin’ in the Lambo.”

The lyrics seemingly reference Drizzy’s failed attempts to sign The Weeknd to his OVO Sound label early in his career when the two collaborated often.
They also appear to be a jab at Baka Not Nice, who is signed to OVO Sound and is active on TikTok. Often assuming the role of Drake’s guard dog, Baka was previously arrested for human trafficking.

Drake responded to The Weeknd on both “Push Ups” and “Family Matters.”
“Can’t listen to the stick talk in falsetto, save it for a Hip Hop n-gga/ You don’t even be at home, dog, you a souvenir-out-the-gift-shop n-gga/ Still mad about that one ho, we ain’t even fuck, I just lip-locked with her/ I get active when it’s war time, I ain’t even really let my dick drop, n-gga,” he rapped on the latter.

He also suggested his fans are mostly gay: “Weeknd music gettin’ played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride/ That’s why all your friends dippin’ to Atlanta, payin’ just to find a tour guide.”
