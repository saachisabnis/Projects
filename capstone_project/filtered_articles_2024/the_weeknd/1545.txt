	Chayse Irvin serves as director of photography, Erin Benach and Hannah Jacobs are costume designers and Elliott Hostetter leads production design.

	“Abel is a visionary whose art cannot be confined by any single medium,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson. “With ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow,’ in partnership with Trey, his musical universe expands onto the big screen with a psychological thriller that will usher in a new cinematic experience for fans. We are thrilled to be bringing it to audiences worldwide.”

	“Hurry Up Tomorrow” is the culmination of the Weeknd’s trilogy of studio albums, following the hits “Dawn FM” (2022) and “After Hours” (2020). This third album in the trilogy serves as the final chapter crafted with existential and self-referential themes.

	The Weeknd, who has sold more than 75 million records, co-created and starred in the 2023 series “The Idol” alongside Lily-Rose Depp.
