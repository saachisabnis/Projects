The Weeknd gave fans in the U.S. a glimpse of the final chapter of his prolific album trilogy on the second night of iHeart Festival.  On Saturday night, September 21, Abel Tesfaye took center stage at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival presented By Capitol One. He wore a black and gold cloak as he crooned the intro of his new single "Dancing In The Flames." Tesfaye was surrounded by an army of red-veiled dancers who broke out all kinds of moves around him as he performed hits like "Take My Breath," "Sacrifice" and "Save Your Tears." He remained at the helm of the stage as he belted out his other upbeat banger "Sao Paulo."  
The Grammy award-winning singer closed out the show with "Blinding Lights" and the rest of "Dancing In The Flames." It was the first time Tesfaye performed the latter track and "Sao Paulo" live in the United States. The Weeknd's rare festival performance went down just a few weeks after he announced the plans for his forthcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. Tesfaye's sixth studio LP is the final installment of his ongoing trilogy which consists of his other hit albums After Hours (2020) and Dawn FM (2022). Following his announcement, he held a massive concert in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he debuted music from the album to hundreds of thousands of fans. In addition to premiering the lead single "Dancing In The Flames," The Weeknd also performed an unreleased collaboration with Playboi Carti. Tesfaye has not announced the album's release date yet. If you missed any of the action this weekend, or just want to re-live it all, an iHeartRadio Music Festival special including highlights from the event will be available to stream on Hulu on October 7th.
