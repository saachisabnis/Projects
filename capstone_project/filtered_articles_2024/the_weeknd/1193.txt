Anitta
Brazilian pop star Anitta has left her mark on the music world in the States with hits in three different languages and collaborations with stars like Cardi B, Snoop Dogg, and Missy Elliott. On the new single “São Paulo,” Anitta joins forces with The Weeknd and brings the Canadian crooner into her world of Brazilian funk.
“São Paulo” follows The Weeknd’s recent singles “Dancing in the Flames” and “Timeless” from his forthcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. The Weeknd first debuted the track during his special one-off concert in São Paulo on Sept. 7 where Anitta joined him onstage to perform. The track would fit in just as well on Anitta’s Funk Generation album released earlier this year, incorporating Brazilian funk influences with The Weeknd’s frequently darker tones.
The singers recounted how the track came together in an interview with Billboard Brasil.
“I wrote some verses as a joke and never imagined they would become serious,” Anitta remembered. “I felt very honored and flattered. I’ve always been a big fan of his and his work. I never imagined this would happen, and now it’s a dream come true. It’s a little more Brazilian funk, as promised, for the world.”
The Weeknd credited the “Girl From Rio” singer with helping foster what ended up becoming the song.
“Anitta is a great friend. What she sent was so awesome that we created the song,” he said. “We knew it was too special to just play on stage. We saw great potential in the song and found the beat, which is the heart of the show.”
The “Blinding Lights” hitmaker is preparing to lay his Weeknd persona to rest, as Hurry Up Tomorrow is set to be his last album released under the name The Weeknd.
