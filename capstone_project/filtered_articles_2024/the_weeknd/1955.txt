Lionsgate won the worldwide theatrical distribution rights for The Weeknd‘s upcoming film, Hurry Up Tomorrow. The psychological, music-packed thriller stars Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye, Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan, and is directed by Trey Edward Shults. The film will be a creative compliment to the Weeknd’s forthcoming album of the same name, with the music from that record augmenting the film’s score created by the Weeknd and Daniel Lopatin. “Abel is a visionary whose art cannot be confined by any single medium,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson. “With ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow,’ in partnership with Trey, his musical universe expands onto the big screen with a psychological thriller that will usher in a new cinematic experience for fans. We are thrilled to be bringing it to audiences worldwide.” (Variety)
