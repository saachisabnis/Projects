Kanye WestÂ has entered the fray of the ongoing feud between rap's biggest names.
The 46-year-old Grammy winner took aim at Drake and J. Cole on his remix of Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar's diss track Like That, which he debuted during his appearance on Justin LaBoy's The DownloadÂ on Saturday.Â 
Kendrick's shots at Drake and J Cole on the original Like That kickstarted the current beef, prompting Drake to recently retaliate with his diss track Push Ups.
On his new remix, Kanye plainly states that he is on Kendrick's side by rapping, 'Yo Dot, I got you,' referencing Kendrick's former alias K-Dot.Â 
He ends his verse by dragging Drake and J Cole with the lyrics: 'Y'all so out of sight, out of mind / I can't even think of a Drake line/ Play J. Cole, get the p**** dry.'Â

Shortly after the remix drop, Kanye doubled down and took to Twitter to post an NSFW meme depicting a woman pleasuring a man after learning he doesn't listen to J Cole's music.Â 
On the remix, Kanye also appears to reference the current sex trafficking investigation surrounding Diddy, who created the fashion line Sean John.
'Can't stop, won't stop/ I just f***** your b**** in a Sean John tank top,' Kanye raps.Â 
Meanwhile,Â Drake followed up Push Ups with a new freestyle on Friday night, which referenced Taylor Swift's new The Tortured Poets Department album.Â 
'Taylor Made Freestyle. While we wait on you I guess,' he captioned theÂ post.Â 
'The first one really only took me an hour or two / Next one is really about to bring out the coward in you,' Drake raps.Â 
'But now we gotta wait a f---ing week because Taylor Swift is your new top,' he continues.
Later in the track, Drake adds, 'Shout out to Taylor Swift, biggest gangster in the music game right now. You know, I move my album when she drop, I said that already.'

The rap beef was reignited when the former actor fired back at Kendrick, 36 â€” who slammed Drake in a guest verse on the album We Don't Trust You in MarchÂ â€” on the Push Up diss track.
The song takes jabs at theÂ GrammyÂ winner's physical stature and suggests that his pop collaborations have caused him to lose his edge.
'Maroon 5 need a version, better make it witty,' the alleged Drake raps. 'Then we need a verse for the Swifties.'
The Weeknd (real nameÂ Abel Makkonen Tesfaye), 34 â€”Â  who also came for Drake on We Don't Trust YouÂ Â â€” is next in line, as Drake sings, 'Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin'/S*** we do for bitches he doing for n****s.'
Fans were quick to flood social media with commentsÂ regarding the credibility of Drop and Give Me 50.
One follower posted the song with the caption 'AI Drake's diss track against Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, The Weeknd. If this isn't AI, all of them are cooked.'
Another chimed in 'The fact no one can tell if it's real or AI says a lot about Drake's music but that's maybe for another time
Yet another fan commented, 'Drake is smart, if everyone likes the diss he'll claim it if they don't he gonna say it's ai and get back in the studio.'

A new song attributed to the Canadian rapper called Drop and Give Me 50 leaked on Saturday, with such scathing lyrics against artists like Kendrick Lamar, 36, The Weeknd, 34, and more that fans questioned if it was created by artificial intelligence; Kednrick (L) in 2022, Weeknd (R) in 2023

Drake has been silent on whether he's behind Drop and Give Me 50, although he did post a photo to his IG about people getting close to a reaction.Â 
The photo, however, was shared before the song dropped.
The Weeknd seemingly responded to the track by sharing an image of himself laughing and eating popcorn, as if to say he is simply a bystander to all the drama unfolding.Â 
The current controversy highlights a recurring concern: the use of artificial intelligence to imitate Drake's voice and style.Â 
This issue gained attention previously when the Recording Academy disqualified an AI-generated Drake song from Grammy consideration, underscoring its prevalence in the industry.

Lamar threw multiple lyrical jabs to both Drake and J Cole, furiously rapping the stand out line: 'Motherf**k the big three, n***a, it's just big me.'
The line was seemingly a direct response to a bar Cole dropped in his collaboration with Drake called First Person Shooter.
'Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick]? Is it Aubrey [Drake]? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league,' J Cole said.Â 
Lamar didn't miss the chance to take another a jab at Champagne Papi, cleverly referencing his latest album title, For all the Dogs.
'Fore all your dogs gettin' buried/ That's a K with all these nines, he gon' see Pet Sematary. Woof!'
Following the Compton rapper's tirade towards his two peers, J Cole released a response track titled Seven Minute Drill.
During the song, he slammed Kendrick as attention seeking, stating the Poetic Justice rapper had fallen off 'like The Simpsons'.
Branding Lamar's most recent album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers 'tragic', Cole warned his peer to lay off the insults.
However it was two days later that the Apparently rapper came forward to apologize for his diss, branding it the 'lamest' and 'goofiest' song he has ever made.
Praising the Good Kid Mad City's artist's catalogue, Cole asked for forgiveness when he took the stage at Dreamville Festival in North Carolina.Â 
'I ain't gonna lie to y'all the past two days felt terrible,' he told the crowd.
Although Metro has recently dispelled rumours regarding tensions between the two, fans have taken to X (formerlyÂ Twitter) to share their hilarious shock reactions toÂ  J Cole being featured on the duo's new song due to his friendship with Drake.Â 
Photoshopping Drake's face onto a disgruntled Thanos' body, one quipped: 'Drake after seeing that J Cole is on the Metro and Future album.'
An image of a confused man in front of a complicated electrical cabinet was captioned:Â 
Fans have been sharing hilarious memes in response to the surprise collaboration between J Cole, Future and Metro Boomin with many confused by his latest move as he was previously friendly with Drake
'Drake tryna figure out how he gonna diss Future, Metro Boomin, Kendrick Lamar, J Cole and ASAP Rocky.'Â 
Another imagined Drake's shock at the collaboration, captioning a snap of a woman suddenly falling with: 'Drake after finding out J Cole flipped on him.'Â 
One fan took a swipe at the Canadian musician and his fans' confusion to Cole's most recent release.
Alongside an image of a confused man, they wrote: 'Drake fans waking up and hearing J Cole on We Still Can't Trust You.'
