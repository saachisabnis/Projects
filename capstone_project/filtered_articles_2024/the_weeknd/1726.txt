Kelly Clarkson helped a couple named Ryan and Marcelo get married during the New Year’s Eve concert of her residency in Las Vegas. “We’ve been together for 14 years, 15 in January,” Ryan told Clarkson as she mingled in the crowd. “Our wedding is tonight, with you.” The singer exitedly agreed to be their witness. “Wait, say something!” she told one of the couple’s friends, who served as officiant. Ryan and Marcelo each said “I do” as the officiant declared the husbands married “by the power of Kelly Clarkson’s show.” The couple then posed for a selfie with Clarkson as the crowd cheered. “You guys, that was so wonderful,” she said. “OK, Marcelo and Ryan, good luck!” Sunday’s concert was part of a four-date extension of Clarkson’s residency at Planet Hollywood. She’s also playing Super Bowl weekend.
