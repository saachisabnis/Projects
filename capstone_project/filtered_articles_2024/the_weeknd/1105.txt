The Weeknd is planning on giving his fans in São Paulo, Brazil a special show at the Estádio MorumBIS on September 7. And for his worldwide audience who can’t be in attendance that night, the R&B superstar is going to livestream his performance that night at 8 p.m. ET on YouTube so everyone can tune in. Not only will the Weeknd be performing his chart-topping hits in front of his passionate Brazilian fans, but the show will also “offer a glimpse into what’s next for the artist,” according to a press release. “I’m so excited to announce that we’ll be live streaming my show from São Paulo, Brazil, so everyone around the world can be a part of this special night,” said the Weeknd in a statement. “I wish I could come to every city and town on earth, but moments like this give us the chance to connect in real time at least and share that energy together, no matter where you are.” (Variety)
