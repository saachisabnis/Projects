Drake has made many key career decisions that have increasingly launched him into megastar status. Back in 2009, he signed a deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money after an intense bidding war among various record labels. He launched his own record label, OVO Sound, in 2012, and has dipped into many different ventures: liquor, candles, merch, a book, restaurants and more. However, in the nearly four months since his battle with Kendrick Lamar ended in May, Drizzy has made public choices that many rap fans and critics consider to be the bad or wrong moves altogether.
While entering lyrical warfare with Kendrick Lamar would have likely caused a lesser MC to fade into obscurity, Drake has certainly remained a hot topic in hip-hop all summer. With the rap community dissecting every new song, social media post and even his fashion choices, there is no question he continues to be one of the most relevant artists in the music industry. However, with that, the 6 God has moved in some ways recently that Drake fans and naysayers alike perceive to be less than godlike.
Here's a look at all the bad moves Drake has made since the battle with Kendrick Lamar ended.
None of Drake's recent decisions appear to be of any sort of detriment to his legacy as one of the GOATS of the rap game. In fact, it could very well be that everything the Toronto MC is currently doing is all part of some master plan to rejuvenate his image among fans. However, at the moment, it's clear that in many instances, fans think he's moving in the wrong way post-beef with Kendrick Lamar.
