Lil Wayne has been accused of betraying Drake after showing love to The Weeknd amid the bitter feud between the Canadian superstars.
In the video for his new “high3r” collaboration with Mike WiLL Made-It and Lil Yachty that was released on Tuesday (August 6), Weezy wears a diamond chain adorned with the logo of The Weeknd’s XO record label.

Fans were quick to question Lil Wayne’s intentions given the recent shots lobbied between Drake and The Weeknd on songs like “Push Ups,”“Family Matters” and “All to Myself.”
“Treachery is afoot,” one person commented on social media, while another asked: “Make this make sense?”

Others were convinced that there are issues between the former Young Money labelmates, with one writing: “Yeah, wayne and drake definitely got beef.”
Conversely, one fan jokingly referenced Wayne’s reputation for being out of the loop on current events: “Wayne the type to walk in the middle of a shootout and not know wtf going on [crying face emoji].”

Despite the alleged betryal, it was just last month that Lil Wayne appeared to pledge his allegiance to Drake in his ongoing feud with Kendrick Lamar.
While performing “The Motto” in Las Vegas, the New Orleans native held up his OVO chain to the crowd and put his own spin on Kendrick’s chart-topping diss song “Not Like Us,” changing the lyrics from “they not like us” to “they don’t like us.”

Tunechiu is actually mentioned on “Not Like Us,” with Kendrick referencing Drake once sleeping with his former label boss’ girlfriend.
“Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that’s connivin’/ Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin,’” he raps.

This revelation was shared by Wayne himself in his 2016 book Gone ‘Til November: A Journal of Rikers Island, although he clarified that it happened before he and his then-girlfriend began dating.
“I woke up still feeling fucked up about the fucked-up day that I had. Hell is what it was! I’m used to arguing with my girl [daily], but finding out that she fucked Drake was the absolute worst thing I could’ve found out,” he wrote.

“As a man, honestly, that shit hurt, and not because it was Drake. It could’ve been any man, and it would’ve hurt the same. She said it happened way before we got together, but she just never told me. When Drizzy came to see me, he was like, ‘Yeah, it’s true … don’t fuck with her like that ’cause I did fuck her.’ Damn!”
