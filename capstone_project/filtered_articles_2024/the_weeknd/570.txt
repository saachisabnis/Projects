Tickets will go on sale Monday for an in-the-round concert by The Weeknd at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 25.
The Canadian-Ethiopian star (real name Abel Tesfaye) said the one-night-only show will feature a previously unseen production, and the stage will take over the entire floor of the stadium.
The concert will mark the release of The Weeknd’s new album, “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” due Jan. 24. Additionally, it was announced this week that Tesfaye is the first artist in history to have 22 songs with over 1 billion streams each on Spotify.
