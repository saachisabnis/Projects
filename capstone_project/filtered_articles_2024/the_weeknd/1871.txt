Drake has wasted little time throwing more shots at Kendrick Lamar after the Compton superstar released his latest album GNX.
Appearing on a Kick livestream with Canadian streamer xQc this past weekend, Drizzy introduced himself by saying: “I’m here — mind, body and soul fully intact, in case you were wondering. You need facts to take me out; fairytales won’t do it.”

The defiant remark is a clear reference to claims in Kendrick’s various diss tracks about Drake behaving inappropriately with young girls, keeping the company of sexual predators and fathering a secret daughter.

While Kendrick did not directly mention Drake on his new album, he did allude to their beef.
On GNX‘s opening track “wacced out murals,” he rapped: “N-ggas from my city couldn’t entertain old boy / Promisin’ bank transactions and even bitcoin / I never peaced it up, that shit don’t sit well with me / Before I take a truce, I’ll take ’em to Hell with me.”

He also referenced Drizzy’s controversial diss song “Taylor Made Freestyle” and Snoop Dogg‘s apparent support of it: “Snoop posted ‘Taylor Made,’ I prayed it was the edibles / I couldn’t believe it, it was only right for me to let it go.”
Tha Doggfather responded to the line soon after by joking on X (formerly Twitter): “K dot new album GNX [explosion emoji] [fire emojis] It was the edibles   [facepalm emoji] [grinning face emoji] [fist bump emoji] west west king.”

While Drake did not make further mention of Kendrick Lamar during his livestream with xQc, he did take time to throw shade at fellow friend-turned-foe The Weeknd.
After xQc began playing the singer’s 2016 hit “Starboy,” Drizzy said: “You’ve gotta switch this song, though. You have to switch this one. We’re the real Sixers, the real 6ix side. We don’t listen to that.”

The former collaborators’ long-simmering feud reignited earlier this year when The Weeknd seemingly took aim at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin’s We Still Don’t Trust You album.
The OVO Sound founder fired back on “Push Ups” and “Family Matters,” spitting on the latter: “Still mad about that one ho, we ain’t even fuck, I just lip-locked with her” and “Weeknd music gettin’ played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride.”
