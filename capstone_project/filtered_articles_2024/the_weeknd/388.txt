Travis Scott brought The Weeknd out as a special guest during a show in Sydney, Australia, and thanked the singer for giving him some long-ago opportunities.
Scott took time to remind the crowd that Abel had brought the Houston rapper along as an opener for what he called his “first arena tour ever” — 2015’s Madness Fall Tour. Scott opened every date on that tour, which ran throughout November and December of that year and also featured Banks and Halsey in support slots.

On Friday (October 18), Scott reminisced to the Sydney crowd about those days as he brought The Weeknd onstage.
“This man right here let me open up for two tours when I put out my first album,” he said. “He gave me my first arena tour ever. If it wasn’t for this guy right now, I probably wouldn’t be on this stage right now.”

Travis and Abel teamed up earlier this year at Mike Dean‘s birthday show in Los Angeles.
On March 1, Dean put on a special birthday show at the Wilton Theater. There, the producer teamed up with the “I Can’t Feel My Face” performer to drop a cover of “In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song),” the David Lynch/Peter Ivers track from Lynch’s movie Eraserhead.

The Weeknd also performed “Take Me Back To LA,” which was first performed in 2020 and is a fan favorite during live shows, but has yet to be officially released.
Meanwhile, Travis Scott performed “Fe!n,” then teamed up with Mike Dean and The Weeknd for “Circus Maximus.”

In an interview around that time with Our Generation, Dean revealed what it was like to play concerts with The Weeknd.
“I opened up for him on the U.S. tour last summer,” he explained. “That came about during a livestream. I was doing a little livestream on Instagram, and Abel was tuned in. And he texted me during the livestream, like, ‘You should just open for me.’”

He continued: “I get to go out, have a budget, get production, and make shit look cool.”
In April of 2023, The Weeknd teamed up with Mike Dean on four new tracks that appeared on the producer’s 4:23.
