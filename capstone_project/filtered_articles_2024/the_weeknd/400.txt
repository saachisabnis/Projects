Apple on Thursday released the first scripted film for its Vision Pro virtual reality headset, providing a window into the future of immersive entertainment. 
The 17-minute film, Submerged, written and directed by Academy Award-winning director Edward Berger, takes viewers inside a World War II-era submarine which has been attacked by enemy warships. Through the eyes of the main character, the viewer feels as though they are in the submarine as it begins to flood and the crew escapes for their lives into the open seas.  
The short film was captured in Apple Immersive Video, a technology designed for VR viewing that uses ultra-high-resolution 3D video and spatial audio to place viewers in the center of the scene.
