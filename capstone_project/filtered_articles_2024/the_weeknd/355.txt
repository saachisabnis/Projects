The Weeknd collects two new hits on the Hot 100 this week thanks to his ongoing friendship with two of the biggest names in hip-hop. As the pop and R&B superstar debuts a pair of tunes on the chart, he ups his career total and hits a very special milestone–one which helps him join an exclusive club.
As of this week, The Weeknd has now racked up more than 100 hits on the Hot 100. He’s up to 101 placements on the weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S., thanks to his latest pair of smashes. Before this frame, he’d claimed 99 appearances on the roster.
The Weeknd debuts two tracks on the Hot 100 this frame, and they’re both collaborations with Future and Metro Boomin. The Canadian star joined them on their latest joint album We Still Don’t Trust You, which opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week.
The title track from that full-length ranks as The Weeknd’s loftiest placement on the Hot 100 this week. “We Still Don’t Trust You” opens at No. 22. At the same time, “All to Myself” launches at No. 67.
The Weeknd is now one of fewer than 20 musicians who have accrued at least 100 charting songs on the Hot 100. He joins a group that includes Nicki Minaj, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, and Justin Bieber, among many others. Drake leads all acts, with 329 hits on the ranking.
The Weeknd’s 101 Hot 100-charting tracks includes 18 top 10 hits. Of that sum, seven have climbed all the way to No. 1.
Including his two new wins, The Weeknd fills four spaces on the Hot 100 this week. His single “One of the Girls” with Jennie from the band Blackpink and Lily Rose Depp sits at No. 70. Another collaboration with Future and Metro Boomin–taken from their recent first album We Don’t Trust You–called “Young Metro” falls from No. 56 to No. 72 in its fourth frame on the tally.
