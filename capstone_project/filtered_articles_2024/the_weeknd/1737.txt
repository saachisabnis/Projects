The Weeknd has just revealed that his forthcoming studio album will be titled, Hurry Up Tomorrow. The musician, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, disclosed details of his new record in a lengthy, cinematic statement on Instagram on Wednesday (September 4). Hurry Up Tomorrow will serve as the final installment of the Weeknd’s current musical trilogy, following 2020’s After Hours and 2022’s Dawn FM. 
“Yesterday was fourteen years ago… We held our breath, falling into a shimmering sea in the after hours of the night… Attempted to cleanse the wounds with melodies and lights, a bulletproof bandage to shield what lies beneath,” the Weeknd’s scrolling text on Instagram disclosed.  “More songs could help, but what do I have left to say? Woe is me in my gilded cage, right? The very thing that once made me invincible failed me on the world stage. A new trauma surfaced, opening floodgates. A new path awaits. When today ends, I’ll discover who I am.”
 No specific release date for Hurry Up Tomorrow has been disclosed as of yet, but Tesfaye had previously stated that his upcoming record will mark his final release under the Weeknd moniker. (Rolling Stone)
