There was no shortage of star power at Monday's 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards, held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.
Beyonce, 42 — who released her debut country album Cowboy Carter on Friday — leaned into her country style in a busty Western-inspired black leather suit from Versace, which she paired with a sheriff cowboy hat.
The 32-time Grammy winner's outfit featured fringe details on the sleeves and was cinched at the waist with a double belt. The superstar was awarded the iHeartRadio Innovator Award at the event. 
Meanwhile Jennifer Hudson, 42, was a silver queen in a metallic gown with feathered sleeves. She completed her outfit with matching heels and a number of rings on her fingers. 
Rapper Ice Spice, 24, showed a glimpse of her abs in a tiny sheer black bandeau top and form-fitting black maxi skirt. The star — who took home the Best New Hip-Hop Artist award — wore a textured black jacket over her barely-there top.

The Munch hitmaker accessorized her outfit with a black cross. Her auburn tresses were parted on the side and lightly curled for the evening. 
Beyonce was presented with the honorary prize by another living legend, Stevie Wonder, 73, at the eleventh-annual ceremony.
The hitmaker was being honored in the wake of her record-breaking release of her album Cowboy Carter, a sequel of sorts to her chart-topping Renaissance and her first album to feature several country-styled songs.
Beyonce stood tall in a pair of pointy black cowboy boots, and the long, wavy blond locks that she has recently been wearing to promote her album flowed out from under her gold-adorned black hat.
As he introduced Beyoncé, Stevie Wonder sang her praises while listing some of her earlier iconic accomplishments, including her 2013 self-titled visual album, her 2016 album Lemonade — which was accompanied by a feature-length film of the same name — and her 2022 chart-topper Renaissance, along with a collaborative LP with her husband Jay-Z, a Lion King soundtrack and two acclaimed concert films.
As she turned to the microphone, she told Wonder: 'I love you' and 'I honor you.'
'I want to thank you for making a way for all of us,' she told him, adding, 'Whenever anyone asks me if there's anything I can listen to for the rest of my life, It's always you.'
She also shared that Wonder had recently helped her out on her Cowboy Carter album by playing the harmonica on her rewritten cover of Dolly Parton's country classic Jolene.
'Tonight, you call me an innovator, and for that I'm very grateful,' she continued as she addressed the audience and the awards body and described her creative process.

'Innovation starts with a dream. But then you have to execute that dream, and that road can be very bumpy,' she explained. 'Being an innovator is seeing what everyone believes is impossible. Being an innovator often means being criticized, which often will test your mental strength.'

The ceremony will also provide a sneak peek of 2024's upcoming hits, along with surprise guests, collaborations, and the stories of the artists who reached number one. 
Since the iHeartRadio Music Awards' inception in 2013, the show has included live performances and appearances by superstar artists such as Alicia Keys, Ariana Grande, Blake Shelton, and many others.
'The iHeartRadio Music Awards is a night where we celebrate the biggest artists and songs fans loved listening to on the radio all year long,' said John Sykes, President of Entertainment Enterprises for iHeartMedia.
'We'll also share stories from the artists themselves about their hard-fought journeys to the top of the charts.'
