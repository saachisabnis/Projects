The Weeknd has previously spoken about After Hours and Dawn FM being a part of an album trilogy and now, it seems that the artist is readying for the third and final release in the series.
Following the drop of 2022’s Dawn FM, The Weeknd took to X to write, “I wonder… did you know you’re experiencing a new trilogy.”
The following year, he spoke with W Magazine, saying that he was “getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter.”
“The album I’m working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd,” he continued. “This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I’ve said everything I can say.”
The Weeknd returned to X on January 7 to confirm that the third album in the trilogy was indeed happening, sharing the cover art for After Hours and Dawn FM alongside a question mark in the space for the third LP’s cover and the “3” emoji.
