A new movie from Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye, which shares a title with his forthcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, has received a North American release date of May 16, 2025, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The suspense thriller stars the Weeknd alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan, with director Trey Edward Shults (known for the A24 movies Waves and It Comes at Night) at the helm. The movie will also feature music from the Weeknd’s frequent collaborator Daniel “Oneohtrix Point Never” Lopatin. The Weeknd and his company Manic Phase are producing the film for Lionsgate.
Hurry Up Tomorrow, the film, follows the Weeknd’s ill-fated TV series, The Idol, which was canceled last year, after (or, said some reports, during) its first season. The new album, meanwhile, is due to arrive January 24 31. It completes the trilogy of 2020’s After Hours and 2022’s Dawn FM, the latter of which featured in Pitchfork’s rundown of “The 100 Best Albums of the 2020s So Far.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the Weeknd’s forthcoming film and album title as Hurry Up Dreaming. The correct title is Hurry Up Tomorrow.
