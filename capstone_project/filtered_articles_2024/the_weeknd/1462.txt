When cutting a The Weeknd song short, Drake stated: "Real Six Side don't listen to that"
Drake took jabs at Steve Lacy, The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar while livestreaming with the popular streamer xQc this weekend.
Over the weekend, the Canadian appeared on xQc’s Kick livestream to announce his upcoming tour in Australia next year. Drake would comment on the music playing in the background of the stream, sometimes commenting on the artists themselves.
When The Weeknd’s 2016 electro-pop hit ‘Star Boy’ came on, Drake swiftly called for the song to be “switched off,” saying the “real Six Side don’t listen to that” – suggestint his former friend and frequent collaborator is an inauthentic Torontonian.

The Weeknd and Drake were originally close collaborators, especially when crafting the latter’s critically acclaimed and Grammy Award-winning sophomore album ‘Take Care’. However, when the ‘XO’ singer signed with Republic Records over his fellow countryman’s OVO label, tensions arose between the two and a private on-and-off feud has been reported between the two ever since.
He also took jabs at Lamar and Lacy. In his introduction, Drake told the chat, “You need facts to take me out. Fairytales won’t do it” – possibly referring to the allegations that sprouted from his and Lamar’s rap battle back in April this year.
When Lacy’s ‘Bad Habit’ came on, Drake also said: “This guy’s like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though.” Some fans thought this statement was an indirect dig in relation to Lacy’s affiliation with Lamar.

After finding great success with the diss song ‘Not Like Us’ and earning his fourth Billboard Number One, Lamar headlined a special one-off ‘The Pop Out’ concert in his home city of Los Angeles, which Lacy attended. The Internet band member also joined Lamar on stage, showing his solidarity with him – and seemingly annoying Drake.
The 6God made it known that he liked the popular 2022 song ‘Trance’ featuring Travis Scott and Young Thug – suggesting he’s still on good terms with them, despite the song being produced by Metro Boomin who he went back and forth with online this summer. The multi-Grammy winner also didn’t say anything when Thug and Future‘s 2017 collaboration ‘Relationships’ came on, although he and the latter aren’t currently on good terms.

While on the same stream, Drake confirmed that he will be touring Australia next Spring on the ‘Anita Max Wynn’ tour. “Melbourne, Sydney, Gold Coast… February 9 ’til like… March something,” he told xQc on stream. More information about the tour – including where to get tickets – will be revealed closer to the time.
In other news, Lamar referred to his feud with Drake on his recent surprise album ‘GNX’. On the opening song ‘Wacced Out Murals’, he brought up Snoop Dogg reposted Drake’s diss track towards the Compton star ‘Taylor Made (Freestyle)’ – to which the hip-hop legend blamed it on “the edibles”.
