The Weeknd gets in his feelings while behind the wheel and Sns, Dave East and Jim Jones hold it down in Harlem. Today's Daily Visuals.
For a minute there a few years ago The Weeknd seemed to love dropping music videos with all kinds of facial makeup that made him look like a Dick Tracy villain, but recently he’s been himself and luckily it seems like he’s much more comfortable in his own skin these days.
Coming through with some new visuals to “Dancing In The Flames,” the Canadian crooner hops in a drop top two seater and “drives” through the elements as he belts out his vocals to some 80’s sounding tunes. The car obviously wasn’t driving anywhere but we get it. Carry on, Weeknd.
Back in America, Sns recruits Jim Jones and Dave East for his latest clip to “Up It” where the three men and their crews hold down the block to puff on some thangs, sip on some potion, and spit their bars. Those were a lot of heavy coats for a video seemingly shot at the end of Summer. Just sayin.’
Check out the rest of today’s drops including work from Powers Pleasant featuring A$AP Ferg and Armani Caesar, Sillk The Shocker (yes, he’s still rapping), and more.
