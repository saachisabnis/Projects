What’s better than one g.o.a.t? TWO! And if Simone Biles completely dominating the 2024 Olympics wasn’t enough to prove that she is one, the athlete just got a major stamp of approval from none other than Beyoncé, further solidifying her as one of our favorite living legends.
Before winning gold at the women’s gymnastics final this week, Biles received an iconic tribute from Beyoncé. The 42 year old singer lent her voice to narrate a heartfelt video that chronicled Biles’ road to the 2024 Olympic Games – and we’re all taken along for the ride.
“Let’s talk about power because, really, that’s what this story is about,” the 32-time Grammy winner said in the tribute video while footage of the 27 year old Olympic great flashed across the screen.
“Physical power, its beauty, its wonder, the way it never stops amazing you. Then there’s spiritual power, the kind that really matters. The power you can’t see, only sense. The power you need in those moments when life goes a little sideways on you.”
Watch the full video here.  Is anybody else feeling emotional after hearing those heartfelt words?
And with Beyoncé backing her, Simone Biles has officially made history at the 2024 Olympic Games. She’s just won another gold medal in the women’s team final with her Team USA teammates, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history!
