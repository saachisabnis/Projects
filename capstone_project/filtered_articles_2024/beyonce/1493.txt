Ice Spice has put her spin on a famous Chance The Rapper lyric after an epic encounter with Beyoncé at the 2024 Grammy Awards.
On Sunday (February 4), the Bronx rap star attended the awards ceremony in Los Angeles where she bumped into Queen Bey and her husband JAY-Z in the audience.

Rocking a fur-laced denim jacket and matching skirt, Ice Spice could be seen smiling from ear to ear while shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with Mr. and Mrs. Carter.
Spice and Bey even spoke for several moments and posed for a photo together.

After the show, “Munch (Feelin’ U)” hitmaker shared her excitement over the encounter on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “just met beyonce im never goin to fail.”
She was referencing a line from Chance The Rapper’s verse on Kanye West‘s “Ultralight Beam” where he rapped: “I made ‘Sunday Candy,’ I’m never going to hell/ I met Kanye West, I’m never going to fail.”
That lyric was itself a nod to Kanye who previously rapped on his 2011 hit “Otis”: “I made ‘Jesus Walks,’ I’m never going to hell.”
Despite meeting one of her heroes, Ice Spice went home from the Grammys empty-handed after losing in each of the four categories she was nominated.
The 24-year-old was up for Best New Artist, which went to Victoria Monét, as well as Best Rap Song (“Barbie World” with Nicki Minaj), Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (“Karma” with Taylor Swift) and Best Song Written for Visual Media (“Barbie World”).

“We want y’all to get it right,” he said, standing alongside his 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. “We love y’all, we love y’all, we just want y’all to get it right. At least get it close to right.
“Obviously it’s subjective because, you know, it’s music and it’s opinion-based, but some things… I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year!”

He continued: “So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. That doesn’t work.
“Some of you are gonna go home tonight and feel like you’ve been robbed. Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don’t belong in the category. Nah, nah, nah. When I get nervous I tell the truth!”
