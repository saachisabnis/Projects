In a new episode of the Scandalous Podcast, Slayer guitarist Gary Holt shares his thoughts about a variety of modern music superstars. The 60-year-old metal legend was quick to praise the biggest pop star of them all, Taylor Swift. “I love Taylor Swift. Why all the hate?” Holt said. “She’s an extraordinarily hard worker. She’s super f—ing nice to everybody, and people hate her. She’s just the biggest pop star on Earth and more power to her. Taylor writes everything. And so, I give her credit. She’s a songwriter.” But when the conversation shifted to Beyoncé, Holt changed his tone considerably. “Beyoncé will put out a song, and there’s 30 f***ing people on it,” Holt said. “How can 30 people write a song, all gathered together? Like you’re not a songwriter, Beyoncé. I think Beyoncé is the most overrated talent on Earth. I think she’s marginally talented.” (People)
