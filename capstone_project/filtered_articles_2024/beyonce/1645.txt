Beyoncé knows that Paris is the place to be right now. To celebrate an exciting fashion week, the singer and beauty brand founder hosted a dinner toasting her most recent venture: SirDavis whisky.
Taking place at the iconic Hôtel Plaza Athénée, the singer took a gastronomic approach to method dressing, which included donning a skin-tight sequin gown that perfectly matched the SirDavis amber juice and an intricate manicure that incorporated the brand’s logo.
But Beyoncé’s platinum hair – which she’s been wearing long and loose since entering her Renaissance era – gave us pause. Like many of her celebrity contemporaries (Greta Lee, Penélope Cruz, Gigi Hadid), the star chose this moment to reveal that she has officially joined Team Bob. Cut and styled by her longtime collaborator Neal Farinah – who also had a hand in developing Cécred – it’s a voluminous single-layer cut that falls under the umbrella of the viral Italian bob. While we haven’t seen her tap into vintage-inspired beauty like this since her Dreamgirls days, I’m loving it. Once a dream girl, always a dream girl.
