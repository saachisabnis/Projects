Iconic!
Mariah Carey, the undisputed "Queen of Christmas" and best-selling female artist of all time, is set to bring her unparalleled holiday magic to screens worldwide this December 25. Carey will star in the Show Open for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix, marking a festive collaboration between the global streaming platform and the NFL.
This exceptional holiday performance will feature Carey delivering a dazzling rendition of her record-breaking holiday anthem, "All I Want For Christmas Is You," as part of a taped segment.
Fresh off her largest and most spectacular Christmas tour to date, Mariah is poised to enchant fans once again with her iconic voice and legendary holiday spirit. This year, Netflix has become the global home of the NFL's two marquee Christmas Day games. The highly anticipated matchups include the Super Bowl LVIII-winning Kansas City Chiefs facing the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 PM ET and the Baltimore Ravens taking on the Houston Texans at 4:30 PM ET. 
While Netflix will stream the games to audiences worldwide, fans in the competing teams' cities can catch the action on CBS affiliates. Additionally, NFL+ subscribers in the U.S. can enjoy the games on their mobile devices, continuing the NFL's long-standing holiday tradition of accessible Christmas Day matchups.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Carey's iconic album "Merry Christmas" and its timeless single, "All I Want For Christmas Is You." Carey released unique 30th-anniversary edition products to commemorate the milestone, allowing fans to relive the magic of the groundbreaking holiday album. Her beloved anthem has achieved an incredible milestone, being certified 16x Platinum by the RIAA. This makes it the highest-certified single ever by a female artist—an achievement befitting Mariah's legendary status.
The song's holiday dominance continues to grow. On December 9, "All I Want For Christmas Is You" extended its record-breaking reign atop the Billboard Hot 100 to a 15th cumulative week, fueled by massive streams, airplay, and sales as the holiday season hit its peak. The track also reclaimed its #1 position on Billboard's Holiday 100 chart, reaffirming Mariah Carey's enduring influence and cementing her place as the ultimate purveyor of Christmas cheer.
Mariah Carey's achievements extend far beyond her iconic holiday hits. As the best-selling female artist of all time, she has sold over 200 million albums and boasts 19 Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles, 18 of which she self-penned. This remarkable feat makes her the solo artist with the most #1 singles in history. With a distinctive five-octave vocal range, prolific songwriting abilities, and exceptional producing talent, Carey's influence on modern pop music is undeniable.
Among her numerous accolades are induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, multiple Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, and three Guinness World Record titles. She has been recognized as Billboard's "Artist of the Decade" and "Icon Award" recipient, as well as the World Music Awards' "World's Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium." Her impact even extends to film, with her critically acclaimed role in Lee Daniels's Precious earning her the Breakthrough Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
As the NFL and Netflix join forces to celebrate Christmas Day, Mariah Carey's starring role in the Show Open is the perfect gift for fans. But her performance is not the only thing that will set the tone for a magical day of football, family, and holiday cheer. Beyoncé is getting fans hyped for her upcoming Christmas Day halftime performance. 
The Grammy-winning icon announced her much-anticipated show during the NFL game between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans at NRG Stadium in her hometown of Houston.
Beyoncé shared the video with a caption that reads, "A Cowboy Carter Christmas. Houston, Texas 12.25," igniting excitement among her Beyhive fans.
