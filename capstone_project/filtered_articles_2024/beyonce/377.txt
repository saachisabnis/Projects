Beyoncé is set to light up TV screens this holiday season.
The singer revealed on Sunday, November 17, that she will perform the halftime show at the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens’ NFL game at NRG Stadium in Houston on December 25.
Taking to X on Sunday night to share a video teaser for the event, Beyoncé captioned the video, “HOUSTON, TEXAS – 12.25.24,” nodding to the dual-header matchup that will air live on Netflix for the first time this year.
The teaser video starts with a shot of a vintage car covered in red roses as the track “Ameriican Requiem” from Cowboy Carter begins to play a cappella. The camera then pans to reveal the vehicle’s plates, which read, “BNCNTRY,” before Beyoncé’s bare legs come into focus as she stands atop the car’s hood.
A spotlight then floods the singer, revealing her dressed in a body-hugging red, white and blue mini dress paired with a white cowboy hat as her platinum blonde hair flows against her frame.
A football then flies towards her arms, which the megastar effortlessly catches as her eyes remain glued to the camera. Her closeup is then revealed before two captions, “Christmas Day Houston, TX,” and “Halftime Show,” flash onto the screen. The final part of the video shares that the televised event kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET on Christmas Day.

Netflix announced on October 20 that two games will be played on December 25 this year. Prior to the Texans and Ravens matchup, the Kansas City Chiefs will take on the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 p.m. ET.
In a video shared via YouTube on October 20, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was seen saying, “What a day for some football, baby!” The clip continued with game-time moments with the teams set to the track “Feliz Navidad.”
“Huddle up for a new tradition,” the streaming service urged at the time.
Beyoncé’s involvement in the Netflix initiative comes after Cowboy Carter was snubbed by the Country Music Association Awards after failing to receive any nominations for the 2024 CMA Awards.

The singer, who debuted her first country-inspired project in March, was absent from every category, and while she maintained silence in the wake of the snub, Beyoncé’s Beyhive made themselves heard.
“Beyonce should host a live show on all platforms at the exact same time as the CMAs. Or release the videos for the album the minute the CMAs begin,” one X user wrote at the time. Another fan added, “Beyoncé didn’t receive a single nomination at the Country Music Awards (CMAs). It has started.”
In the leadup to the release of Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé was vocal about her entrance into the country music scene. “Today marks the 10-day countdown until the release of Act II. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the supporters of ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’ and ‘16 Carriages,’” she wrote via Instagram on March 19, referring to the first two singles from Cowboy Carter. “I feel honored to be the first Black woman with the number one single on the Hot Country Songs chart.”
