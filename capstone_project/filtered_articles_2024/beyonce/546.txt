OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) — Beyoncé took to Instagram Wednesday to drop the track list of her highly anticipated country album "Cowboy Carter."
The megastar shared that the album will feature country music legends Dolly Parton, Linda Martell and Willie Nelson.
The new project, set to be released onMarch 29, will feature "Texas Hold 'Em" and "16 Carriages," as well as "Blackbird," "Jolene," "River Dancem Levi's Jean," "The Martel Show" and more.
Last week, the Grammy winner discussednot feeling "welcomed" in country music. Beyoncé said because of that experience, she dove deeper into the history of the genre and studied.
"The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me," she wrote. "Act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work."
