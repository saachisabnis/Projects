Welcome to the Week in Fashion, Bazaar’s at-a-glance guide to what the industry is talking about.
Brat summer may be over, but it’s clear that Charli XCX will continue to dominate the cultural conversation all through the fall. The latest win for the experimental pop singer comes in the form of a new ambassadorship, as she’s just been named the face of Valentino Beauty. The collaboration was announced on the same day that Valentino Beauty launched the Spike Valentino Buttery Matte Lip Color, a shade that Charli will apparently be bringing with her as she continues her Sweat Tour with Troye Sivan.
In a statement to Allure, the “Girl, So Confusing” singer said, “I’m kind of really only into working with brands that encourage and amplify individual expression, and that’s obviously something that Valentino Beauty does. I think you can see that from the history of the people that they work with and also their products.”
Everyone’s favorite cool girl—and style inspiration, Chloë Sevigny, was just named the new face of Saint Laurent earlier this week.
In a series of portraits, Sevigny modeled pieces from the maison’s fall/winter 2024 collection. One shot saw Sevigny wearing a frilly white top under a brown leather jacket, which she paired with a burgundy skirt, black tights, and tremendously high black pumps. In another photo, Sevigny wore an all-black fit that consisted of a totally different leather jacket. She layered the outerwear over a lacy slipdress and accessorized with one of the brand’s large Sac de Jour tote bags.
The looks were styled by Paul Sinclaire, while Juergen Teller shot the photos. Sevigny shared one of the images to her own account, crediting the team and simply writing: “Merci to all 🥀.”
On Wednesday, October 2, the highly-anticipated collaboration between Luar and Moose Knuckles finally became available to shop.
The two luxury brands have united for a small capsule collection, which consists of coats, shawls, parkas, a skull hat, and a fuzzy new iteration of the iconic Brooke bag from Luar. These looks were first spotted at the Luar ‘Deceptionista’ show back in the spring, and now, fashion lovers can finally get their hands on them before the temperatures really start to drop.
Carlos Nazario, who works as the global artistic director for Moose Knuckles, said, “I deeply respect Raul [Lopez]’s vision and it has been a treat to witness what he has built with Luar. Growing up in this industry together, it was a natural choice to collaborate with him, my chosen family. The beauty of this collaboration comes to life through our shared experiences, and I am thrilled to finally marry the Moose Knuckles and Luar communities.”
Meanwhile, Lopez said, “It’s so exciting to be working with a brand that champions innovation, technology, and design. Those themes are always at the forefront throughout my design process making this partnership feel so organic.”
Twice a year, Pitti Immagine Uomo takes over Florence, bringing together different designers and industry insiders for an event honoring menswear and accessories. And ahead of the January 2025 gathering, Pitti Immagine just announced MM6 Maison Margiela as the guest designer for the forthcoming event.
This means that the label will be presenting a brand-new collection designed exclusively for Pitti Uomo, while also showing a month later at Women’s Fashion Week in Milan.
To go with this news, the brand shared a statement that read: “We are honored and excited to be invited as Pitti Uomo’s guest designer this coming January, as part of the world’s most important menswear fashion fair. We intend to bring the style and spirit of MM6, creating a menswear project specifically for Florence. After nearly 20 years we are thrilled to return Maison Margiela to the Pitti stage and bring to the fore a contemporary menswear wardrobe that will resonate the attitude, concepts, and processes of MM6.”
Mel Ottenberg, stylist and editor in chief of Interview magazine, teamed up with RE/DONE to launch “Club Mel,” a capsule collection of mostly-denim pieces that were inspired by Ottenberg’s most-beloved pair of 80s 505s that he purchased from a vintage store.
The unisex collection features straight-leg and more wide cut jeans, denim jackets, and sporty tees that say “Club Mel Athletics” on the front. To help celebrate the release, Ottenberg filmed a video with a few of his famous (and fashionable) friends, including Dara Allen, Alissa Bennett, Beka Gvishiani, Mona Matsuoka, Ollie Muhl, Lynette Nylander, and Ryan Petersen.
The pieces can be purchased now from the RE/DONE website, or on SSENSE.
It was only a matter of time before Beyoncé found some way to team up with Levi’s. Back in March, when Queen Bey released her eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter, one of the tracks was titled “Levii’s Jeans” (featuring Post Malone). In the song, the pair sing about how someone wishes they could be Beyoncé’s jeans, so that they could “hug [her] ass all day long.” It was a pretty straightforward sentiment.
Now, Beyoncé has appeared in a new ad campaign for Levi’s. The photos see her posing inside a laundromat wearing the brand’s jeans along with a matching denim hat. To round out the fit, she sports a white tee, blue boots, and a belt that says “Levii’s Jeans” on the front (spelled the same way she spells it for her song).
Meanwhile, a corresponding video was released, which shows Beyoncé walking into a laundromat and stripping her pants before throwing them in the washer, proceeding to go sit down on a bench in her underwear. From the looks of it, this is only the beginning of a long relationship between Bey and the denim brand, as the commercial was advertised as “Chapter One.”
