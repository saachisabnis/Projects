Beyoncé Knowles is expanding her presence in the country music world with the introduction of her new whiskey brand, SirDavis, under the LVMH luxury group. This move could bring her closer to becoming a billionaire, a title her husband, Jay Z, already holds thanks to his success in the alcohol sector. She revealed the brand's launch on Instagram, posting a photo of herself with a whiskey glass and the caption "DAVIS IN MY BONES." SirDavis features a unique ribbed glass bottle wrapped in leather, with a logo inspired by the horse Reneigh, which appears on her "Renaissance" album cover. The brand’s slogan, "The future of whiskey is here," was trademarked by Moët Hennessy, a part of LVMH, in June. Although it's unclear how much of SirDavis Beyoncé owns, the brand's success could greatly affect her estimated net worth of $760 million as of May, which includes earnings from her successful music career and various ventures, like her former Ivy Park line in partnership with Balmain and her production company, Parkwood Entertainment.
The launch of SirDavis places Beyoncé alongside other celebrities who have succeeded in the alcohol market, such as Jay Z, who earned $300 million from selling half of his Ace of Spades champagne brand and $750 million from divesting a majority stake in D'ussé Cognac to Bacardi. A 750ml bottle of SirDavis is priced at $89.99, with orders set to begin shipping in September. Keep it locked to 103.5 The Beat for more!
