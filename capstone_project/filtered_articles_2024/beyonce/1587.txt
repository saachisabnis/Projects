Parker McCollum and Brittney Spencer delivered the hard-hearted breakup anthem “Burn It Down” to the 2024 CMT Music Awards stage on Sunday. 

	The “Compassion” singer appeared in an embellished red dress, while McCollum took the stage in a fitted black t-shirt and cap as the pair performed against a backdrop of literal flames. Spencer’s soaring vocals elevated the radio hit as the pair took on the smoldering chorus: “Burn it down ’til it’s ashes and smoke/Burn it down to the smolderin’ coal/Burn it down ’til I don’t want you no more.”

	McCollum, who is in the midst of his 2024 Burn It Down tour, released the smash radio single last June as part of his fourth studio album, the 15-song Never Enough. The Texan has earned two Number One Billboard Country Airplay hits with 2020’s “Pretty Heart” and “To Be Loved By You” the following year — the latter appearing on his debut LP Gold Chain Cowboy and winning him Breakthrough Video of the Year at the 2022 CMT Music Awards.

	Meanwhile, Spencer made history alongside other guest appearances on Beyoncé‘s recently released Cowboy Carter, the second act of the trilogy of albums that began with Renaissance. Spencer, who drew attention in 2021 when she covered the Highwomen’s track “Crowded Table,” featured alongside rising Black country singers Tanner Adell, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts on “Blackbiird” — Beyoncé’s  reimagining of the Beatles 1968 song.

	Spencer also memorably performed Martina McBride’s “Independence Day” at the 2021 ACM Honors and joined Brothers Osborne to wrap the 2022 Academy of Country Music Awards, both at the Grand Ole Opry. Her album My Stupid Life released earlier this year.
