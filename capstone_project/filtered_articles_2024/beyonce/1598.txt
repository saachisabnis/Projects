SZA is not happy with fans who have apparently leaked several songs from her forthcoming deluxe edition of SOS, titled Lana. Earlier this week, in a now-deleted tweet, the rapper wrote, “Y’all leaked three songs from the deluxe. At this point, y’all can keep the throwaways and leaks. I’ll be starting ‘Lana’ from scratch. Do not ask me about it again.”

	Last night, SZA further addressed the issue in a series of tweets, confirming the deluxe edition of SOS will now feature “the leaks and outtakes” and Lana will be its own thing. “Lana deserves more time and music no one’s ever heard before,” she wrote. 

	The musician called out a fan, named Janessa, who leaked “unreleased pics and audio” and noted, “Being that this is material form Lana this prompted me to make a decision. I decided w all the leaks and me not knowing what someone has or doesn’t have it’s too complicated so I should jus consolidate the leaks and the outtakes and drop that as to not prolong the process and then focus on my next project as a win win for everybody.”

	










	She added, “And please be clear anybody defending a thief is weird as fuck . I don’t come in your job and take shit and fuck up your work . Why would that be okay ? Where’s the home training ? Nobody wants to prosecute a young woman . We’ve all asked very nicely for some time now.”
Will be dropping the leaks and outtakes from SOS as promised as the deluxe asap. Lana deserves more time and music no one’s ever heard before 🫶🏾 seems fair . Bless 💗

	SZA released SOS, her second studio album, in 2022, earning nine Grammy nods and winning three of the nominations, including Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Best Progressive R&B Album, and Best R&B Song. She announced Lana as a reissue of the LP last year, revealing six cover art variants and releasing single “Saturn” last month.

	Last year, SZA told Variety that Lana had grown into “more than she expected.” “It’s definitely turning into its own album, and I guess I could drop a new album randomly because no one’s actually expecting that from me right now,” she explained. “But I can’t tell if now’s the time to be consistent or carefree. On the one hand it’s like, ‘What would Beyoncé do?’ But I am also deeply inspired by people who do whatever the f**k they want, like Frank Ocean and Andre 3000. Some of my favorite songs were the ones that I dropped on SoundCloud because it was so stress-free.”

	










	This isn’t the first time SZA has dealt with fans leaking her music. In January, she threatened to take legal action, writing, “Leaking my music is stealing. This is my job. This is my life and my intellectual property. You are a fucking thief, and I promise to put maximum energy into holding everyone accountable to the full extent of the law. I am tired.”
