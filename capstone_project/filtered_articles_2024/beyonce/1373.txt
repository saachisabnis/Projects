Beyoncé is adding another business to her portfolio. 
On Tuesday (August 20), Beyoncé launched a new whiskey brand called SirDavis in honor of great-grandfather Davis Hogue, who was a farmer and moonshiner during Prohibition. 
Bey announced the spirit brand in an Instagram post, sharing photos of herself holding her whiskey bottle in a white crocheted dress. 
“DAVIS IN MY BONES,” the singer captioned her photos, referencing Cowboy Carter's “Bodyguard.”
According to the SirDavis website, whiskey has been Bey's "drink of choice for years."
“When I discovered that my great-grandfather had been a moonshine man, it felt like my love for whisky was fated,” Beyoncé said in a statement. “SirDavis is a way for me to pay homage to him, uniting us through a new shared legacy.”
The singer joined forces with Moët Hennessy to “craft a one-of-a-kind flavor profile that reflected her whisky ideals," the SirDavis website states. Customers can expect “the complexity of rye … married with the elegance of malted barley” that is “finished to perfection in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks, a harmony of spice with sublime hints of fruit.”
The whiskey is currently being sold on SirDavis.com and retails at $89.99 for a 750mL bottle.
