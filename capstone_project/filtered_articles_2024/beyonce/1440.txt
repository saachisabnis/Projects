LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – MARCH 14: Beyoncé accepts the Best R&B Performance award for ‘Black Parade’ onstage during the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.
Is Beyoncé teasing her rock era? Well, fans believe so after the superstar sported a mullet during one of her editorial looks for her cover of CR Fashion Book. However, Beyoncé's reasoning for wanting to wear a mullet is a slight act of rebellion after her mother, Tina Knowles, wouldn't let her.
"I always wanted an asymmetrical cut in the ’90s, but my mother wouldn’t let me do it. So I’m having the time of my life at this shoot," the Houston native told the publication as she modeled the black and grey cut. "Hair is actually the first step when I’m creating tours, films, and albums; being able to see the hairstyles first is what influences the sound, looks…everything," she added.

While Beyoncé may be jokingly getting back at her mom with this cut, fans were hyper-focused on the fact that she might be teasing a rock album for Act III.
"Beyoncé please give us a rock album," a fan wrote responding to a photo of the singer rocking the mullet.
"Beyond you can also live out this fantasy for the act iii rock album," another fan pleaded.
Growing up, Beyoncé was always at Headlines, a salon that her mother owned in their home city. Now, Beyoncé has come out with her own hair care line, Cécred, which officially launched last month.
"Cécred is a legacy project for me, one that’s probably the most rooted in my ancestry," she told Essence in her cover story.
The singer added that it is "far beyond a business" and that it is a part of her lineage. "Having access to proven ingredients and creating our own technology that is patent-pending — we now have a line that works universally," she said.
So far, Cécred has eight pieces that include a clarifying shampoo and scalp scrub, moisturizing deep conditioner, moisturizing shampoo, sealing lotion, nourishing hair oil, reconstructing treatment mask, hydrating shampoo, and fermented rice and rose ritual treatment. Additionally, as part of the accessories, Cécred sells a cosmetic bag and a "shaking vessel."
Products range from $30-$52 and can be used for all hair types.
It should cost a billion to look this good. Beyoncé's outfits have been putting on a show of their own. The multi hyphenate performer began her Renaissance World Tour trek in Ma. On February 1, Beyoncé posted across her social media "RENAISSANCEㅤ ㅤWORLD TOUR 2023."

She has since showcased her talents (and iconic outfits) throughout Stockholm, Paris, London, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and more.
Before the arrival of Renaissance, which she released in 2022, the artist posted a message about her state of mind during the creation of the project.
"Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world. It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving," she penned on her official website at the time. "My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration."
She also noted that Renaissance is part of a three-act project. The other two acts have not been specified on whether they will be additional albums or when they are set to arrive.
Her tour has also broken several records, including ones she has set herself as an artist. Her five-date residency at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, England was the highest-grossing engagement by an American artist, a Black artist, and a woman, with gross earnings of $42.2 million, according to Billboard.
In July, Beyoncé earned $127.6 million for a run of 11 shows between July 8 and 30, which beat Bad Bunny as the previous record holder as no artist has made over $100 million within one month since the chart's inception in 2019.
Also, her two-night shows at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 29-30, also topped the Top Boxscores chart by selling 106,000 tickets and earning $33.1 million which is the highest-grossing concerts by a female artist in history.
The Renaissance World Tour has grossed $295.8 million total through Aug. 1, and marks Beyoncé’s highest-grossing tour of all time. The Formation World Tour in 2016 made 256 million, and her 2018 On the Run II tour with Jay-Z made 253 million.
She is estimated to break the half-billion mark by the tour's end in October.
While fans have lined up worldwide to witness Beyoncé perform, a part of the Renaissance experience is the elaborate role that her costumes have played as well. Take a look at 15 of her most iconic outfits from the tour below:

Beyoncé truly made a statement when she walked out on stage in this elaborate Vegas look. She wore a chrome thin strapped body suit with silver fringe at the top with over the knee boots completely covered in fringe then accentuated every time she walked. The accessories speak for themselves as the oversized silver fringe jacket is a statement piece in its own right as is the matching large hat yet all of them work together instead of overpowering each component's shine. Keeping with a futuristic look, the Grammy winner also wore oversized shield sunglasses.
