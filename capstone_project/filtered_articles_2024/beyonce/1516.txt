Musicians and singers are used to basking in the glow of fame — but sometimes they share the spotlight with their kids.
When Superstars like Beyoncé, Pink and Kelly Clarkson hit the road, they have been known to bring their children along for the ride.
Beyonce’s daughter, Blue Ivy, 12,  joined her mother onstage in Paris during the Renaissance World Tour in May 2023, and the singer took to Instagram to share a sweet message to her pride and joy.
“My beautiful firstborn 🙏🏾 I’m so proud and thankful to be your mama. You bring us so much joy, my sweet angel,” she wrote.
While most celebrity appearances with their kids are well-received, some artists have attracted negative attention for sharing the stage.
