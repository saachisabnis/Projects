Beyoncé is set to perform during halftime of the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens game on Christmas Day, and the music superstar has something special planned for the festive occasion in her hometown. Beyoncé shared a promotional video for her performance on Instagram on Wednesday (December 11), captioning the post, “A Cowboy Carter Christmas. HOUSTON, TEXAS 12.25.” In the clip, Beyoncé is shown hanging a football ornament on a cactus while snow falls all around her, shooting off celebratory gun fingers while dressed stylishly in all white and sporting an oversized white fur cowboy hat. The halftime show is set to feature Beyoncé’s highly-anticipated debut live performances of songs from her chart-topping, multiple-Grammy nominated album, Cowboy Carter. The game is set to kickoff at 4:30 ET on December 25, and will be streaming exclusively on Netflix. (Rolling Stone)
