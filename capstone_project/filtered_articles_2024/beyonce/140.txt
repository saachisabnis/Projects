You can’t hold Beyoncé down.
The singer’s country song “Texas Hold ‘Em” has hit the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, which is her ninth No. 1 hit as a solo artist.
Just last week, the song earned the singer her first country radio No. 1 hit, which made her the first Black female artist to top the Hot Country Songs chart.
The single is one of two country songs Beyoncé dropped on Feb. 11, Super Bowl Sunday. The other single, “16 Carriages,” debuted at No. 9 on the same chart.
Not only is “Texas Hold ‘Em” hot on the charts but it’s gained the attention of music legend Dolly Parton. 
Days ago, the country icon took to Instagram to congratulate Beyoncé on her achievements.
“I’m a big fan of Beyoncé and very excited that she’s done a country album,” she wrote. “So congratulations on your Billboard Hot Country number one single.”
The songs came as a surprise to fans.
She announced the new music unexpectedly at the end of her Verizon commercial that aired during the big game.
Both songs are expected to be featured on her upcoming, country-themed album, which is referred to as “Act II,” on March 29. It’s a follow-up offering to her 2022 album “Renaissance,” which is frequently referred to as “Act I: Renaissance.”
