Mathew Knowles managed Destiny’s Child and praised his granddaughter on her extraordinary talent as an artist.
At age 12, Blue Ivy Carter has already won a Grammy, performed as one of Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour dancers, and impressed her family with not just her performing talent but also her makeup skills. Her grandfather Mathew Knowles, who managed Destiny’s Child, recognized Blue’s talent and potential in an open letter he addressed to her.
He expressed his pride in her work on his daughter Beyoncé’s tour, then pointed out that Blue really can do anything; she just has to choose what she wants to go into. “Whether it’s in music, art, science, business, or any other field, I hope that you have the courage to pursue it wholeheartedly,” he wrote. “Whatever path you choose, I hope it brings you fulfillment, joy, and a deep sense of purpose.⁠”
He told her that “you have already shown the world that you are a force to be reckoned with, and I have no doubt that one day you will continue to astound us all.⁠”
