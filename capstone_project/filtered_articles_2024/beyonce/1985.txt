The vinyl version of Beyoncé’s latest album is missing five tracks that are on the complete release, fans have claimed.
Hailed as a “masterpiece” by music critics, Cowboy Carter came out at the end of last week and comprises 27 tracks over its 80 minutes.
However, fans have noticed that the vinyl album is missing the songs Spaghetti, Flamenco, The Linda Martell Show, Ya Ya and Oh Louisiana.
The second of three albums in a Renaissance trilogy created by the artist was released on Friday to great anticipation as Beyoncé became the first black woman to top the US Hot 100 with a country song.
Vinyl collectors Matt and Juan posted on TikTok that they were “miffed” some of their favourite songs were not on the £32 album.
Matt said: “It’s such a shame because Ya Ya is probably up there with my top five favourite songs at the moment.”
He added: “I’m quite miffed that it’s not on here.”
Matt speculated that there could be a “deluxe” version of the album on the way, which would include all of the missing songs.
Fans also posted their frustration on reddit.
One wrote: “What is up with that?! How could she sell an incomplete album?” Another said they were “so sad” about the missing tracks, as first reported by the BBC.
Robert Komaniecki, a music theorist, posted on Twitter that there were “apparently some people who ordered the vinyl are finding out that it’s missing songs”. “Kind of weird and not good,” he added.
However, it is not uncommon for vinyl to have fewer records than digital versions. It is also possible that the missing songs were added to the later version of the album and as such the Vinyl pressing plant process began before the digitised album was finalised.
