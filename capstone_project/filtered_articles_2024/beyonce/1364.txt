	Twenty-seven years after the arrival of Missy Elliott’s debut album Supa Dupa Fly, the rap legend is plotting her first-ever headlining tour: Out of This World: The Missy Elliott Experience. The 24-date arena run will feature support from Ciara, Busta Rhymes, and Timbaland — three artists who are closer than just collaborators for the musician. 

	“Fans have been asking me to tour forever but I wanted to wait until I felt the time was right because I knew if I was ever going to do it, I had to do it big, and I had to do it with family,” Elliott shared in a statement. “So get ready to be taken OUT OF THIS WORLD with me, Busta Rhymes, Ciara, and Timbaland! We can’t wait to share this experience with the fans!”

	The Out of This World tour will begin its trek through North America on July 4 with an opening show at Vancouver’s Rogers Arena. Elliott will headline shows in Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Houston, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Newark, Toronto, and more cities. A special hometown show at Virginia’s Hampton Coliseum is scheduled for Friday, Aug. 2 with the tour set to wrap later that month. 

	










General sale for the tour will begin on Friday, April 12 at 10 a.m. local time. Presales will run throughout the week beginning on Tuesday, April 9. 

	“This is an incredible time in my life as I am experiencing so many milestone ‘firsts,’” Elliott continued. “Being the FIRST female Hip-Hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and now going out on my FIRST headline tour.” It has been 20 years since Elliott completed a proper tour, having joined Beyoncé and Alicia Keys on the co-headlining Verizon Ladies First tour.

	“It’s an experience, it’s not just you seeing the artist on the stage,” Elliott told Associated Press about the Out of This World tour. “I want people to travel to those moments, those [music] videos, I want you to relive it on stage. It is most definitely a lot of good, good stuff. Expensive stuff!”
