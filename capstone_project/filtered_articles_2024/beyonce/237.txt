Listen, we can’t help it — whenever Taylor Swift or Beyoncé steps out wearing something cute, we immediately do a deep dive into how we, too, can purchase that item. Sometimes, the price tag is so high that we have to settle for a dupe. But every so often, these style stars add surprisingly affordable bags to their expensive outfits, like toting around under-$400 styles from Aupen.
While Swift was first spotted rocking Aupen’s sleek Nirvana bag in August of last year, and later, rewore the $340 style for a date night with Travis Kelce, Beyoncé seems to be sharing a $180 Aupen purse with her daughter, Blue Ivy. While the 12-year-old was toting the Purpose Bag at the Renaissance movie premiere in November, Bey broke it out again in April, this time, pairing it with a leather shorts outfit that she showed off on Instagram.

However, the music powerhouses aren’t the only famous faces who have worn this sustainable and ethical brand. Hailey Bieber and Olivia Rodrigo have also carried around Aupen’s Purpose design, while Jennifer Lawrence has worn Aupen’s Fearless Re-Edition bag ($340) at least three times. Selena Gomez completed her 2023 MTV Video Music Awards after party look with a fringed Purpose Ice purse ($240), and if you’re in the market for earrings, you should know that Aupen makes jewelry as well, including its Splash earrings ($340), which have been spotted on Emma Stone.
Clearly, Aupen makes the new must-have accessories for the fashion-forward crowd, and the good news is we won’t feel too guilty adding to our own collection.
Ahead, we’re rounding up some of Aupen’s most popular — and cutest — styles. We have a feeling we’ll see even more celebrities carrying these bags in the near future.
Taylor Swift’s wardrobe budget is a lot higher than our own, but every so often, she’ll wear something that’s reasonably priced. Sure, she once styled this asymmetrical purse with a Versace look, but it would look just as great with pieces from Reformation and Free People (AKA two other brands the singer wears often).
Want a quality, grab-and-go purse that looks just as great with jeans as it does a formal outfit? Beyoncé, Blue Ivy, and Hailey Bieber have all toted around this sleek black bag, styling it with everything from casual denim to sequin gowns.
This design is so classic, it’s no wonder that it has become one of Jennifer Lawrence’s go-tos. If you’re not too into the black colorway, don’t worry: it comes in multiple shades, including pink and olive green.
Selena Gomez wore this bag to an awards show after party, but it also popped up in her “Single Soon” music video. It may be $240, but if it doesn’t qualify as a fancy accessory, we don’t know what does.
Is it any surprise that Selena has worn this one, too? Embellished with high-quality Zirconia, it was the perfect way to complete a wedding guest outfit back in November—and now, we’ll probably take a note from the signer and do the same!
