This ain’t Texas — this is the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, where Beyoncé didn’t surprise the crowd, as speculated, during Post Malone’s Saturday, April 27, performance. Luckily for the crowd, plenty of other artists made an appearance.
Malone brought out special guests Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley and Sara Evans.

With the recent release of “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé’s debut into country music, fans speculated that the singer could make an appearance during Post Malone’s set.
The theory first emerged after Coachella-goers spotted Cowboy Carter-branded trucks at the festival. When Beyoncé never showed, fans speculated that perhaps she was coming out at Stagecoach, held at the same grounds, the Empire Polo Club, as Coachella.
Fans briefly speculated that the singer could be hiding behind stage name “Backwoods Barbie,” a mysterious act on Saturday night’s lineup, before the consensus became that if she was planning to come, she’d join either Willie Nelson or Malone.
Malone is a featured artist on one “Cowboy Carter” track – “Levi’s Jeans.”
