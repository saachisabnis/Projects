Rumors that Beyonc√© will announce a tour to support her eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter, have been swirling online since the project came out last week. And though the singer has not announced plans for a tour as yet, the speculation has many fans already anticipating steep ticket prices. 
‚ÄúBRB gonna apply for a new credit card,‚Äù wrote one person on X in response to a post from a pop culture account that suggests Beyonc√© will announce a tour on Friday. ‚ÄúI mean, we don‚Äôt have money, but we will be there,‚Äù wrote another.¬†

While there has been no official announcement of a new tour, the singer‚Äôs most followed fan accounts fueled rumors on Thursday by sharing a link on to a site called BeenCountry.com, which takes users to a page of photos of Beyonc√© and one of her mother when she was younger with her maiden name, Celestine Beyince.
As rumors fly, fans are begging Beyonc√© to hold off on announcing a tour, joking that they still need to financially recover from her last one. The Renaissance World Tour, which wrapped up in Oct. 2023 and was her first since the On The Run Tour II in 2018. According to Billboard, tickets for the Renaissance Tour ranged in price depending on the reseller. The average fan could expect to pay around $400 to $550, Billboard reported, with resale tickets for her Houston show going for as low as $279.
‚ÄúNO TOUR UNTIL 2025,‚Äù one post said, and it was met with support from other commenters. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt going to the cowboy carter tour y'all,‚Äù another post says, ‚ÄúI thought I had more time. I thought I had more time.‚Äù

Another person joked that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat real food because they knew the concert would be expensive. According to Billboard, the Renaissance Tour tickets ranged in price depending on the reseller. They report that the average fan could expect to pay around $400 to $550, with resale tickets for her Houston show going for as low as $279.

The rumors of a new tour are still unfounded, but not impossible‚Äîalthough it would come faster than Beyonc√©‚Äôs announcement for the Renaissance World Tour, which arrived several months after she released the album in 2022. It would not be unlike Beyonc√© to have a few tricks up her sleeve, some that delight her fans‚Äîand some that throw them into a frenzy.
