There is a three-letter word for song's like Beyonce's "Texas Hold 'Em."
The iconic singer and songwriter just crossed over into country music, and premature conversations about what that means and whether radio will or won't play her music pours water on the most ear-pleasing piece of twang you'll hear in 2024.
"Texas Hold 'Em" is smart, daring and unbelievably fun, but nowhere near kitsch.
Her lyrics (below) touch all five senses, but this new song isn't destined for that category of musical poetry that's saved only for snobbish critical acclaim and Grammy attention. As a single, it's a monster that requires immediate replay.
Credit Bey, Nate Ferraro and Killah B for an arrangement that brings authenticity to this vocal spotlight. That's really what "Texas Hold 'Em" is. You'll wait in the car to hear micro-notes in words like "tornado" and "heat wave." As the song closes and she begins that final chorus — it's really just unfair to the rest of us that she can sing like that!
Name the last song you'd truly wait in the car to hear. A Chris Stapleton song, maybe? Something by Carrie Underwood, perhaps? With just the gentlest of promotional pushes, Beyonce's "Texas Hold 'Em" will be the country song of the summer, if not the year.
They call these kinds of songs a HIT.
Below is the original version and lyrics to Beyoncé's "Texas Hold 'Em." Country radio may play the clean version, which mutes words like "b---h" and "s--t."
Did You Know?: "Texas Hold 'Em" was written by Beyoncé, Brian Bates, Elizabeth Lowell Boland, Megan Bülow, Ferraro and 1990's R&B hitmaker (and Tony! Toni! Toné! band member) Raphael Saadiq.
