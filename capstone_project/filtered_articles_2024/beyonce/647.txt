Even Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson had to go out of his way to get Taylor Swift tickets.
The actor admitted in a new interview that he had to “pull strings” so one of his friends could see the pop star’s sold-out Eras Tour.
“It’s never happened in my career. Usually, I don’t have to pull strings. Usually, I’ll just … I just make it happen,” he told “Entertainment Tonight” Sunday.
Johnson, 52, explained that a “good friend” reached out to him for help seeing the “last concert” on 34-year-old Swift’s blockbuster tour, which ends next month after 149 shows.
“I’m never good at asking for that kind of stuff. I’m good at giving it. Hate asking for stuff. I don’t do it,” the “Moana” star said.
“But in this case, made a little call, Taylor made it happen. [We got] tickets … [my friend was] happy. I got the picture of the happy ladies who were there. I appreciate that about Taylor.”
Swift is set to perform the final concert of her Eras Tour in Vancouver, Canada, on Dec. 8.
Several A-listers have attended the “Bad Blood” singer’s trek since it kicked off in March 2023, including Tom Cruise, Prince William and, of course, her boyfriend, Travis Kelce.
Johnson shared that his three daughters — Simone, 23, whom he shares with ex-wife Dany Garcia, and Jasmine, 8, and Tiana, 6, whom he shares with his wife, Lauren Hashian — love both Swift and Beyoncé.
“We love Taylor. We love Beyoncé. Tia, our littlest one, we call her Teyoncé,” he told “ET.”
The “Red One” star said his youngest child “owns it” and will “come strutting over.”
Jasmine and Tiana make voice cameos in the forthcoming Disney sequel “Moana 2” alongside their dad, who reprises his role as Maui.
