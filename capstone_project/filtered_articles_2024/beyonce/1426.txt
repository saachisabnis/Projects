One of the songs on the album, “Fortnight,” which features Posty, debuted at No. 1 with 25.2 million streams, surpassing the previous record set by Adele’s “Easy on Me,” and making it the biggest single-day song streaming hit in Spotify history.
Post Malone’s profile in the pop culture mainstream was certainly raised thanks to Taylor Swift, and this is a success that Young Buck hopes to replicate in the future.

Talking to podcast host and fellow Nashville native Ed Clay on his self-titled podcast, Buck spoke about the Music City and his hopes to unite its biggest stars.
“I had a dream that I got this big record with Taylor Swift,” he said. “That’s always been something big of mine to be able to share a stage with Yelawolf, Jelly Roll, Taylor Swift and me. I think we owe Nashville something like that.”

Beyoncé, however, does not need Taylor Swift’s help to make her albums a success, as was recently demonstrated by Swift’s absence from Cowboy Carter.
On March 29, Entertainment Tonight learned that while Swifties speculated that Taylor provided background vocals on Bey’s “Bodyguard,” the rumors — caused in part by someone in Beyoncé’s inner circle — were ultimately false.

Asked by the presenters about a potential collaboration with a country artist that is Swift, the producer replied: “You gonna have to wait and see,” before he added: “Let’s just say she is on the approach of shocking the world. I’ll let your imagination decide what that means.”
