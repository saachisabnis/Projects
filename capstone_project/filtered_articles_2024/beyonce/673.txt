Free Beyoncé tickets and massive book deals are among the perks of being a Supreme Court justice, financial disclosures released Friday revealed. 
The filings from eight of the court’s nine justices listed outside income, gifts received and investments made by the jurists last year, all of which they are required to disclose annually. 
Four justices – Brett Kavanaugh, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor –  reported raking in nearly $1.6 million from book deals and royalties in 2023. 
The highest sum was reported by Jackson, President Biden’s most recent appointee, who received a $893,750 advance from Penguin Random House for her upcoming memoir, “Lovely One.” 
Kavanaugh disclosed that he earned $340,000 in royalty income for a yet-to-be-published “legal memoir.”
Gorsuch reported $250,000 in book royalties from HarperCollins Publishers, and Sotomayor listed nearly $87,000 in book-related money from Penguin Random House. 
The disclosures also require the justices to itemize any gifts received while sitting on the bench. 
Jackson reported receiving four concert tickets valued at $3,700 from Grammy Award-winning singer Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. 
She also said she was gifted artwork for her Supreme Court chamber valued at $12,500.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who previously failed to disclose trips he took with billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow, noted that in 2023 he received two photo albums from Terrence and Barbara Giroux worth $2,000.
Terrence Giroux is the executive director of the Horatio Alger Association, a nonprofit that provides college scholarships to low-income students. 
Justices also had to report any other income they received aside from their Supreme Court paychecks. 
Sotomayor reported an $1,879 payment from Fred Rogers Productions for lending her voice to the animated PBS children’s show “Alma’s Way.” She also disclosed that she has a rental property in Miami that brought in between $5,001 and $15,000 in income in 2023.
Justice Elena Kagan revealed that she rented out a parking space in Washington, DC, that generated between $15,001 to $50,000 for her last year. 
Several of the justices also reported receiving modest salaries from teaching gigs at law schools. 
Gorsuch made  $29,798 from a position at George Mason University, Kavanaugh earned $25,000 from the University of Notre Dame Law School and Justice Amy Coney Barrett received $14,947 from Notre Dame as well. 
The eight associate justices receive a $298,500 a year salary for their work on the bench. Chief Justice John Roberts gets paid  $312,200 for his position. 
Justice Samuel Alito did not file his disclosures Friday and received a 90-day extension.
