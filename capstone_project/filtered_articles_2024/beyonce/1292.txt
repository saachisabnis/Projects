During an interview with E! News before the 2024 MTV VMAs on Wednesday (September 11), Shaboozey weighed in on the controversy surrounding Beyoncé receiving zero nominations at the 2024 CMA Awards. Shaboozey currently has the Billboard No. 1 song for nine weeks running with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” while he was also featured on “Spaghettii” and “Sweet Honey Buckiin'” off Beyoncé’s Billboard No. 1 album, Cowboy Carter. 
“It’s definitely unfortunate. I mean, if that’s something she was looking to receive and that’s something that she worked for, it really sucks,” Shaboozey says. “I know as an artist, you put a lot of time and a lot of work and a lot of energy into music. Awards aren’t really — they’re not everything. As long as you’re connecting with people and genuinely making music that’s impacting people, that’s all that matters, you know? She changed my life, and changed the lives of other artists as well. To me, if I could do that for another artist, or another person in general…I’d be at peace.” (Taste of Country)
