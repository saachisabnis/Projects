Long live cowgirls! With Morgan Wallen's hit song "Cowgirls" taking the country by storm this summer, and Beyoncé's "Texas Hold 'Em" on radios all across America, it seems as if 2024 is the year of the cowgirl.
Actually, Spotify has officially declared it such.
More than 220,000 user-generated "cowgirl" playlists have been created on Spotify this year, the platform reveals. You've probably noticed more and more celebrities and influencers wearing Western boots and wide-brimmed hats to have the whole look, too.
According to Spotify, the search for "cowgirls" has increased so much due to the explosion of country music and how it's hitting a more mainstream audience. Country has seen a staggering 110 percent increase in U.S. streams on Spotify in the last five years.

With already-popular pop acts like Beyoncé and Post Malone crossing over and embracing country music, the genre continues to expand.
There is a curated "Coastal Cowgirl" playlist that is really popular on Spotify right now, as well as a "Neon Cowgirl" playlist that has seen more than a 100 percent increase in streams this year.
The songs that are most-added? "Jolene" by Dolly Parton, "Cowgirls" by Morgan Wallen, "Tennessee Orange" by Megan Moroney, "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker and "Wide Open Spaces" by the Chicks.
Spotify notes that some of the top artists added to user-generated "cowgirl" playlists include Beyoncé, Kelsea Ballerini, Kacey Musgraves, Kane Brown and Taylor Swift.
