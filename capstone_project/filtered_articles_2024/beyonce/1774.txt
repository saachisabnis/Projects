🕯️ forms quick prayer circle 🕯️
Ever since news dropped that Beyoncé is performing at the Houston Texans vs Baltimore Ravens halftime show on Christmas Day, fans have been holding out hope that a world tour announcement is incoming. But rumors kicked into overdrive when Hits Daily Double posted this: 
"Word is that Beyoncé is starting to promote her upcoming tour, which should be enormous, beginning with a halftime performance during the NFL’s Ravens-Texans Christmas game airing on Netflix. Talk about a kickoff."
Soooo...is Beyoncé going on tour? Unfortunately, no. Per Page Six, the Grammy winner's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down rumors on Twitter, writing "Untrue. Nothing to report here. Whenever there is any news, you will hear it directly from the source first."
Truly 😭, but at least we have the halftime show coming up! Which, reminder, Netflix will be streaming. And yes, it's going to be the first time Beyoncé performs songs from Cowboy Carter live!
As the streamer put it, "This performance in her hometown of Houston, Texas, produced by her company, Parkwood Entertainment and Jesse Collins Entertainment, will be the first live performance of songs from her genre-bending and record-breaking Cowboy Carter album.   The 11-time Grammy-nominated, juggernaut recently became the most nominated album by a female artist."
They added that "Beyoncé is expected to feature some special guests who are featured on the Cowboy Carter album."
Can't wait to lie on the floor surrounded by yule logs and enjoy Bey's show—which is going down at 4:30 p.m EST on December 25.
