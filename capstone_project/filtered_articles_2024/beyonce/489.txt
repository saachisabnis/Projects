Kelsea Ballerini said “my nerves were astronomical,” when she performed an unreleased song for the first time in front of Beyoncé earlier this week.
Ballerini hosted a Q&A with her fans in a live-streamed video on Instagram on Wednesday evening (October 9), during which she was asked about performing “I Would, Would You” in front of Beyoncé at Glamour’s Women of the Year Awards the night prior. 
“My nerves were astronomical, playing a new song that I’ve never played before, acoustic, to a room of 100 people…but everyone was lovely. Beyonce was lovely…what a moment,” Ballerini said.
The Knoxville, Tennessee-born singer-songwriter performed “I Would, Would You,” from her upcoming 15-track studio album, Patterns. She said after the performance: “I’m a country artist, and the fact that Beyoncé made a country record [COWBOY CARTER] changed the game. So thank you.”
During her Q&A, Ballerini also spoke about Patterns, her sold-out album release show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and more.
Though the album release show is sold out, iHeartRadio is holding a contest to attend the concert and catch up with Ballerini in a backstage meet and greet. To enter to win, head over to the free iHeartRadio app, or click HERE for more info.
“The whole time I was making this album, I was visualizing and dreamscaping ways to bring it to life for our live show, and it was something I couldn't wait more than five days after its release to do,” Ballerini said in a statement. “When good things happen, when new chapters begin, you want to share them with your people. This time around, it just so happens to be in a bucket list venue in the heart of a city that is landmarked heavily in the music and visuals of PATTERNS. I'm so giddy to be celebrating this album release at Madison Square Garden...see you in New York City!”
Patterns will make its debut on October 25.
