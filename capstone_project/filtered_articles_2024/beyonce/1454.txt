"Thank you for sharin your talent and art with the world"
Post Malone has shared a heartwarming message for Beyoncé following the latter’s Christmas-day Halftime Show last week – see his message below.
On Christmas day (December 25), Beyoncé headlined the NFL’s Christmas-day Halftime Show in Houston, Texas, where she performed songs from ‘Cowboy Carter’ live for the first time. During the performance, she surprised the audience by bringing out Post Malone to perform their collaboration ‘Levii’s Jeans’.
Yesterday (December 29), Post Malone took to X (formerly Twitter) to give thanks to Beyoncé for inviting him to perform at the Halftime Show. He wrote: “thank you @Beyonce so much for havin me out in Houston, and on your beautiful record. also, thank you for sharin your talent and art with the world. I love you”

Following the conclusion of the Christmas-day game – which was live-streamed on Netflix – Beyoncé’s complete performance was shared on Netflix as a standalone special dubbed Beyoncé Bowl.
During the set, which ran for under 13 minutes, Queen Bey was joined by the likes of Shaboozey, Reyna Roberts, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer and Tiera Kennedy. Her eldest daughter Blue Ivy Carter also joined along to dance to ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’.
To kick off the Halftime performance – which fans are calling “the best Super Bowl performance of all time and it wasn’t even the Super Bowl” – Beyoncé performed ’16 Carriages’. Other songs she performed included ‘Blackbird’, ‘YA YA’, ‘My House’, ‘Jolene’ and more. She was joined by Shaboozey for ‘Sweet Honey Buckiin”.
Elsewhere, Post Malone is due to headline Coachella 2025 alongside Lady Gaga and Green Day.
