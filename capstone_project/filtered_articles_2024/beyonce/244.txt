We're not crying, you're crying! 
Tina Knowles has supported her daughter Beyoncé all throughout her career, and now, Queen Bey is reciprocating the love by showing up for her mom at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards, where Lawson was honored.
During the event, Mama Tina appeared on stage to give a powerful speech on motherhood, and how proud she is of her daughters. She said, "My daughters have brought me such incredible joy and pride in my life far more than anything else. They are my crew, my tribe, my rocks, my ride or dies. They have been right there by my side at the lowest points of my life, and they have cheered me on at the highest points of my life, making me feel like I could conquer anything."
It was at that point that Beyoncé began to tear up (as we all did).
Tina continued, "I am asked most often, 'What is the proudest moment you've had with your daughters?' And my answer is always the same. What I'm most proud of is the human beings that they are. How they have managed to stay humble, grounded, generous, gracious and kind, and how they've managed to put it all into their art."
