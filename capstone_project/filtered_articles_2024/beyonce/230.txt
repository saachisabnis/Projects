I hope Beyoncé finally wins AOTY, so the narrative of her having to get that award stops for good, it’s kinda tiring having the same convetsation over and over every time she releases a new album no matter if she deseeves it or not (this album in particular was very boring to me and she should have won in 2015 instead of Beck or maybe 2017)
In ROTY I hope the go with Espresso, BOAF is great but the idea of Billie winning again a GF song category kinda turns me off
In SOTY I want DWAS to win, maybe not the best written song ever but it’s very iconic as this point, I would have prefered it to be nominated for ROTY instead, anyways Gaga winning a GF grammy would be awesome, she’s an excellent songwriter even if Bruno winnning it could be overreward him again
BNA should go to Chapel, she has that spark you see in artists that will last in the industry 
Gaga winning SOTY and Beyoncé winning AOTY the same night is too perfect scenario for me. It’s not happening xd
It’s a shame that’s not for either best work. Arguably the worst, for one of them.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
Gaga winning SOTY and Beyoncé winning AOTY the same night is too perfect scenario for me. It’s not happening xd
Beyoncé hate train is Starting to become a thing, maybe she will win but it wont be a satisfying win with everything is happening right now I think
Honey, get fucking real!  “Cowboys Cry Too” is NOT winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance.  Pure fucking delusion.
I think people underestimate Cowboys Cry Too in Country Duo. This song did quite well on country radio and fits the previous category winners. Kelsea Ballerini and Noah Kahan are both relevant in country scene and it would be a way to award both. It also the lead single of Kelsea’s most successful album to date. She sold out a Madison Square Garden for the first time and the song was performed at the CMAs. Noah had an amazing year too.
And the American Roots branch now vote in the country field too, and Noah is quite popular / liked amongst that crowd.

Jimmy Carter has died – I wonder if that’ll change any votes for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording

He’s nominated against The Beatles
I can see a scenario where Beyoncé loses all of her categories, except AOTY. Kinda like Taylor and Folklore.
 He’s nominated against The Beatles 
guy Oldfield is the actual nominee I think?
Honey, like always, Beyoncé will win several genre awards as consolation prizes for losing Album of the Year.
5 weeks before the 67th Grammys and still no official announcement who’s hosting yet.
Migs
I know I am delusional because this won’t happen but Beyoncé doing a Cowboy Carter medley of American Requiem, II Most Wanted, Bodyguard and Tyrant with Miley and Dolly as guests would be so good!!!!
Who do you think will be the most awarded artist? 
I think it will be Beyoncé again – she won 4 out of 9 in 2021 and 2023. With 11 nominations, I’m thinking at least 5 but if she over performs, maybe 7 wins, setting a record for a female artist or even 8 wins and she’d join Michael Jackson and Santana’s record.
