Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are perhaps two of the biggest names in music right now.
Both superstars have amassed substantial fortunes throughout their careers, but who claims the throne as the wealthiest?
Let's delve into Swift and Beyoncé's net worths, breaking down the numbers and the income streams that contribute to their respective empires.
Swift has etched her name in history, becoming the first musician to achieve billionaire status solely based on her songs and performances.
As of February 2024, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth at a staggering $1.1 billion.
The "Cruel Summer" hitmaker's fortune can be attributed to her record-breaking "Eras Tour" and the soaring value of her music catalog.
About half of Swift's wealth, over $500 million, is derived from music royalties and touring, according to the publication.
The "Eras Tour" alone contributed substantially, with estimated earnings surpassing $190 million after taxes from just the first leg.
Guinness World Records reported, citing data from Pollstar, that the tour's total revenue would exceed $2 billion when the "Anti-Hero" singer finishes all her scheduled shows.
Swift gets around 85% of all revenue generated by her ongoing tour, according to The Washington Post.
The superstar reportedly personally makes between $10 million and $13 million for every stop, according to Forbes.
In addition to this, Swift has also raked in $137.5 million in digital singles and $51 million in album sales, the Recording Industry Association of America said.
Meanwhile, Swift's music catalog -- which includes the albums "Taylor Swift," "Fearless," "Speak Now," "Red," "1989," "Reputation," "Lover," "Folklore" and "Evermore" -- constitutes another $500 million of her fortune.
When she signed with Universal Music Group's Republic Records in 2019, Swift was granted complete ownership over her songwriting and recordings.
Under the label, Swift released new albums "Lover," "Folklore," "Evermore" and "Midnights."
She also dropped "Fearless (Taylor's Version)," "Red (Taylor's Version)," "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" and "1989 (Taylor's Version)," which she re-recorded after her masters were sold to Shamrock Capital in 2020.
Fans are anticipating the re-recordings of "Taylor Swift" and "Reputation," but the singer confirmed during the 2024 Grammy Awards Sunday that her next release is neither of them.
Swift teased her upcoming album, "The Tortured Poets Department," scheduled for release on April 19.
Though not yet a billionaire, Beyoncé is on a trajectory toward that status.
As of December 2023, Forbes estimated her net worth at $800 million, marking a significant surge from the $540 million reported in June of the same year.
This remarkable increase can be attributed to her lucrative 2023 earnings, particularly from the "Renaissance World Tour."
The "Renaissance" tour, which spanned 39 cities in 17 countries, generated over $579 million in revenue, solidifying its position among the highest-grossing tours in history.
Beyoncé took home around $100 million from the tour, according to the magazine.
Forbes also reported, citing unnamed insiders, that the superstar's music catalog is now worth around $300 million.
The rest of Beyoncé's fortune was attributed to her art collection, properties, film projects and business ventures.
Beyoncé split the revenue from her self-produced and directed "Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé," which is based on her concert tour, with AMC Theaters.
The "Crazy in Love" hitmaker also founded the production, management and entertainment company Parkwood Entertainment, whose artists include Beyoncé, the Carter family and the duo Chloe x Halle.
In addition, Beyoncé's diversified portfolio includes a $320 million real estate portfolio with her husband Jay-Z and lucrative ventures like Ivy Park, her fashion collaboration with Balmain and her perfume line, Cé Noir.
Last year, she ended her five-year deal with Adidas for her athleisure brand Ivy Park, for which she received $20 million in annual compensation, The Wall Street Journal reported.
