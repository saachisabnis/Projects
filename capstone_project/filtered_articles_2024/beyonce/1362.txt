A two-year-old boy in the Philippines is the envy of every card-carrying member of the BeyHive after he received a very special gift from the Queen herself.
In an April 24 Instagram post, Tyler’s mother, Bea Fabregas, shared pictures of her smiling son with the bouquet of blue flowers and stuffed animal Beyoncé sent him along with a special personal message. 
“For the record @beyonce and Tyler are now actually, officially friends! Through the power of Queen B’s internet (millions of views and likes it’s crazy!) she saw the video and sent over some of her favorite blue flowers, a new animal best friend for Tyler and the sweetest message that our family will now always treasure. In her note (which she started out with “To my friend Tyler” ) she said, “I see your halo, Tyler,” Fabregas captioned her post. 
It all started with a video clip Fabregas posted to Instagram on April 17 in which the two-year-old asks his mom to set up a play date with the “Break My Soul singer.
“Can we visit Beyoncé?” Tyler asked in the clip. 
“We don’t know her personally,” Fabregas responded. “She’s not mama’s friend.” 
But Tyler was not trying to take no for an answer, insisting that he and Bey are buddies. 
“Beyoncé is my friend,” he told his mom. “I want to meet her.” 
And while he didn’t get to meet Beyoncé, his persistence paid off in a big way with very special gift. Tyler’s mom  thanked everyone who helped her son’s video go viral and created a moment she’ll never forget.
“Thank you to everyone who shared it, commented, liked it. Tyler maybe too young to remember all this, but i’ll always remind him to dream big and shoot for the stars!! BEYONCE SENT MY BABY FLOWERS!!!!” she wrote.
