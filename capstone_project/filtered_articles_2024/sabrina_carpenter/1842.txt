I miss these characters so much 
Girl Meets World was an iconic coming-of-age series on Disney Channel, first airing in 2014 and running for three seasons. The series followed main characters Riley and Maya through middle school dealing with family and relationships. It was a spin-off of Boy Meets World which ran in the 90s, with the main characters going on to be the parents of Riley in Girl Meets World.
It has been seven years since Girl Meets World ended, leaving us all emotional as Maya, Riley, Farkle, and Lucas sat in Coryâ€™s classroom telling him everything they have learnt about friendship and wondering where the cast is now. The show acted as a huge stepping stone in their careers for many of the younger cast involved, most notably, Sabrina Carpenter with her music career rocketing her to fame. Hereâ€™s a look at what Sabrina Carpenter and the rest of the Girl Meets World cast is up to now:

Sabrina played Maya Hart, the best friend of Riley Matthew, whoâ€™s parents were in Boy Meets World. Since the show ended in 2017, Sabrina has gone on to work on some amazing projects; starring in films such as Emergency, Work it, The Hate U Give, The Short History on the Long Road and multiple others.
Sabrina has also pursued a career in music and has been releasing music for a long time now but has since had her song Espresso go viral on TikTok and it topped the UK charts for five consecutive weeks. Sabrina has recently performed at BBC Radio 1â€™s Big Weekender, as well as headlining Coachella.
In her personal life, Sabrina is in a relationship with Barry Keoghan, who starred in Saltburn. They were first linked in December of 2023 and seem to be going from strength to strength with Barry starring in the music video for her latest single Please, Please, Please.

Rowan now boasts a huge 7.3 million followers on Instagram, and has been using her platform to campaign and raise money for Palestine during the ongoing conflict.
She was cast in the futuristic thriller Snowpiercer in 2019, and since has starred in the Hulu movie Crush which came out in 2022, a rom-com about an artist who joins her high school track team.
