Lana Del Rey in particular struggled with microphone issues throughout her headlining set
Day one of Coachella 2024‘s first weekend has wrapped, but not without controversy as fans have been taking to social media to voice their disdain for the sound quality at this year’s festival.
Throughout the course of day one (April 12), several artists faced sound and technical issues, especially on the main stage – known as the Coachella Stage. Some of these acts include headlining Lana Del Rey, Sabrina Carpenter and The Japanese House.
The Japanese House were one of the first bands to take to the Mojave stage. Amber Bain and co. hit the stage roughly ten minutes late and were met with various technical difficulties while performing. “This is my first Coachella, can you tell?” joked Bain as she tried to solve the issues so that they could continue their set.
Though there were issues including the lack of vocals feeding into Bain’s in-ears along with too much guitar and no keys, The Japanese House were able to pull through, performing a mix of fan favorites including ‘Sad To Breathe’, ‘Touching Yourself’ and ‘Boyhood’ which Bain dedicated to all the gays.
Whoever Coachella had for sound during The Japanese House needs to be FUCKING FIRED GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF WHEREVER HE IS

The Japanese House spending half of her set insisting the sound is right is a show within itself

Then, Sabrina Carpenter took to the Coachella Stage, where she faced several technical difficulties including the volume of her microphone, and a sustain pedal not being set up correctly.

NME’s The Cover stars YOASOBI also experienced rough sound conditions, with fans sharing that they could “hardly hear” singer Ikura.

However, it was headliner Lana Del Rey who drew the shortest end of the stick. Throughout the course of her performance, fans aired their grievances about the sound quality, as Lana’s microphone volume was noticeably lower than her backup singers’ and her microphone would occasionally beep and crackle.
At one point, Lana addressed the sound, saying to the crowd: “As quiet as I am, how are you doing? There’s little that I have to say, can you hear me well?”
“As quiet as I am, how are you doing?”

Unfortunately, the sound issues continued when she brought out special guests such as Billie Eilish, Jon Batiste and Jack Antonoff to perform. See more X reactions below.
