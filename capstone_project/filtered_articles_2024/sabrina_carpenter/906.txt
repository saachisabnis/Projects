	This potential chart-topping success would be a huge breakthrough for Carpenter, whose previous albums have yet to make a major impact on the U.K. charts. Now, with Short n’ Sweet, she’s not only aiming to crack the Top 40 for the first time but to do so in spectacular fashion.

	However, the chart battle is far from over. Following their much-anticipated reunion announcement, Oasis is experiencing a resurgence that could shake up the rankings. 

	The Gallagher brothers’ iconic band has three albums set to re-enter the Top 40 this week: their former chart-leading greatest hits compilation Time Flies… (1994-2009) at No. 14, the legendary (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? at No. 26, and their seminal debut Definitely Maybe, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, at No. 31.

	With the hype surrounding their reunion tour, these albums are expected to climb even higher as the week progresses, making Oasis a strong contender in this week’s chart race.

	Irish rockers Fontaines D.C. are also on fire with their new release, Romance, which is on track to debut in the Top 10, marking their fourth consecutive album to achieve this milestone in the U.K.

	Travis Scott’s Days Before Rodeo is set to debut in the Top 10 at No. 6 after its release on streaming platforms for the first time. Meanwhile, country star Lainey Wilson is on track to secure her first U.K. Top 10 album with Whirlwind, reflecting the growing influence of country music across the pond.

	Louis Tomlinson’s LIVE album, featuring recordings from his 2024 Faith In The Future and world tour shows, is expected to debut just outside the Top 10 at No. 11, adding yet another achievement to the former One Direction member’s solo career. Alt-pop artist Cassyette is also making a notable entry, with her debut album This World Fucking Sucks on track to debut at No. 22.

	With Sabrina Carpenter leading the pack and Oasis making a strong comeback, this week’s U.K. Official Albums Chart is shaping up to be an exciting race to the finish. 

	










	Can Sabrina maintain her lead and claim the No. 1 spot, or will the legendary Oasis surge ahead? The countdown to the top continues.
