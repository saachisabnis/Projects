That was a fun party! 
While the album was released at midnight--Eastern Time--and available on streaming platforms in Boise at 10:00p.m. local time, fans couldn't be stopped. A listening party at Boise's famous Record Exchange drew out ton of fans that waited in line, many of whom purchased the album on CD, Cassette, or vinyl!
The excitement in the air was amazing. Fans couldn't wait to get their hands on the brand new vinyl, see all of the different versions of merch available, and listen to the album on the speakers, as a community, at The Record Exchange.
Prizes were given away--like gift cards, Taylor Swift tees, and free vinyl throughout the night.
Fair to say that Boise is all in on Sabrina Carpenter? Absolutely. And we know that many are still singing all of the songs today!
