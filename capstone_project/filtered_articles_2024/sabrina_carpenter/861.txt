Sabrina Carpenter gave fans a sneak peek at her at next album with “Slim Pickins,” a country-tinged song about her limited options. As always, Carpenter doesn’t air her frustrations without a hint of humor. Uncover the meaning behind Carpenter’s tongue-in-cheek track, below.

Carpenter makes use of a country motif for this song, playing into the song title. In the opening lines, she orients the listener to her love life. Guess I’ll end this life alone, she sings. In the subsequent verses, she further explains why she is destined to end up lonely. 
Guess I’ll end this life aloneI am not dramatic, these are just the thoughts that pass right through meAll the douchebags in my phoneI play ’em like a slot machineIf they’re winnin’, I’m just losin’
Carpenter says what many are thinking: it’s slim pickins when it comes to love. It’s hard to find the right one in a sea of the wrong ones. Carpenter created the perfect song for that conundrum. It’s helpful to laugh in the face of a sad truth. That’s exactly what Carpenter is doing here. 
Oh, it’s slim pickingsIf I can’t have the one I loveGuess it’s you that I’ll be kissingJust to get my fixingsSince the good ones are deceased or takenI’ll just keep on moanin’ and b—hin’
She lists off humorous–though deeply relatable–”icks” one could have with a partner. Bad spelling, bad attitudes, and unsatisfactory equipment….Carpenter isn’t afraid to tow the line of what is usually expected of a pop song. The verses in this track are proof of that. 
Jesus, what’s a girl to do?This boy doesn’t even know the difference between “their,” “there” and “they are”Yet he’s naked in my roomMissing all the things he’s missingGod knows that he isn’t living large
Watch Carpenter debut this track alongside Jack Antonoff, below. 
It’s slim pickingsIf I can’t have the one I loveGuess it’s you that I’ll be kissingJust to get my fixingsSince the good ones are deceased or takenI’ll just keep on moanin’ and b—hin’Moanin’ and b—hin’
And since the good ones call their exes wastedAnd since the Lord forgot my gay awakeningThen I’ll just be here in the kitchenServing up some moanin’ and b—hin’
