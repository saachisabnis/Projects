Sabrina Carpenter has officially launched her highly anticipated Short n Sweet tour, and fans are buzzing with excitement. The 25-year-old pop star kicked off her sold-out arena tour with a spectacular opening night on Monday, September 23, at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Known for her captivating performances and infectious energy, Sabrina is once again proving why she’s a force to be reckoned with in the music world.
The night started on a high note as Sabrina opened with her latest single, “Taste,” instantly electrifying the crowd. Her vocals and stage presence were on point, setting the tone for an unforgettable show. Fans were equally thrilled when the concert wrapped up with a performance of her song “Espresso,” a fan favorite and the perfect closer for the evening.
However, it wasn’t just the music that had people talking. Sabrina brought an element of surprise and fun to her performance by playing a spontaneous game of spin-the-bottle with her dancers. The twist? Whoever the bottle landed on got to choose a surprise cover song for Sabrina to perform. For the opening night in Columbus, Sabrina treated the audience to an energetic rendition of ABBA’s classic hit “Mamma Mia.” Fans can expect this fun twist to continue throughout the tour, with a new cover song at each stop, keeping the show fresh and unpredictable.
But not everything went as expected during the concert. One of the most buzzed-about moments was when Sabrina performed her hit song “Nonsense.” For those unfamiliar, Sabrina has been known to switch up the outro of the song during live performances, adding in playful, often racy lyrics that keep the crowd laughing and entertained. In past performances, she’s even thrown in cheeky references to her boyfriend, and during her New Year’s Eve show in Times Square, she delivered some bold, NSFW lines that became instant fan favorites.
On opening night of the Short n Sweet tour, though, fans were left hanging when the outro for “Nonsense” didn’t happen. Instead of Sabrina delivering her signature ad-libbed lyrics, her microphone was muted as she descended beneath the stage. To add to the drama, a message appeared on the big screen, reading, “We apologize for the interruption of our program due to technical difficulties.” It didn’t take long for fans to realize that there were no actual technical issues—it seems Sabrina has chosen not to include the outros for this tour.
While some were disappointed by the lack of a playful outro, others appreciated the comedic moment and the mystery surrounding the decision. Whether it’s part of a larger theme or just a bit of on-stage humor, it’s clear that Sabrina knows how to keep her fans on their toes.
Despite this twist, the opening night was a massive success, and the Short n Sweet tour is shaping up to be one of Sabrina’s best yet. With a mix of new songs, surprise cover performances, and her signature charm, the tour promises to be a wild ride for her fans.
From her show-stopping opening to her quirky sense of humor, Sabrina Carpenter is cementing her place as one of pop’s brightest stars, and the Short n Sweet tour is yet another testament to her talent and creativity.
