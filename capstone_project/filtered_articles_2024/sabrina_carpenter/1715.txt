After scoring her first career pop radio #1 with “Feather,” Sabrina Carpenter is ascending to the next tier of superstardom with follow-up “Espresso.”
The song, which debuted in the Top 10 on last week’s Billboard Hot 100, has been providing a jolt to her already momentum-rich 2024.
Though it fell on this week’s Billboard Hot 100 due to the influx of new songs from Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department,” it still enjoyed a massive week of consumption. Combined with interest in the balance of her discography, the consumption sends Carpenter to #10 on this week’s Billboard Artist 100. Up twelve places from last week’s position, the mark represents a new career high.
“Espresso,” meanwhile, continues to get hotter. The song reached #1 on the Global Spotify Streaming Chart for April 29, courtesy of its 9.8 million daily streams.
It concurrently hit #1 on the US Spotify chart with 3.2 million American plays.
