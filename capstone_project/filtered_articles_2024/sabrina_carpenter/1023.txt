Lanachella, an unexpected reference to Jesus, K-pop buzz and much more: Per usual, the first day of the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival has brought no shortage of social media commentary, and we’re here to give you the rundown on what has everyone talking.
Before attendees even arrived at this year’s first weekend of the annual festival, a roadside installment caught the eyes of the internet. Coachella’s Friday headliner Lana Del Rey’s infamous 2012 SNL performance is referenced in an odd billboard on Interstate 10 near the festival grounds in Indio.

Interpreting the meaning behind the message, X user @honeymounz wrote, “She was crucified by the critics and opened the doors for modern alt acts to thrive… she’s literally the Jesus of modern music.”
The SNL performance referenced was widely-known for its off-pitch vocals and general awkwardness, called one of the worst at the time of its airing. More recently, it was brought up again in an alleged comment made by a 2024 Grammy voter that was leaked, noting that Del Rey didn’t receive the caster’s vote because they “haven’t taken Lana Del Rey seriously as an artist since her infamous SNL performance and never will.”
It’s unclear whether Del Rey is actually behind the billboard, but fans speculated that it was meant as commentary on the alt-singer’s comeback, given that she’s a headliner this year.

At the end of her Friday night set, pop-singer Sabrina Carpenter threw an oversized tee over her concert attire that read, “Jesus was a carpenter.” Queue fan reactions.

The outfit-change was likely a reference to controversy late last year after Carpenter filmed her music video for her song “Feather” in a Catholic church. In response to critics calling the move sacrilege, Carpenter noted that she had received permission to film there and added that “Jesus was a carpenter” in a cheeky reference to her own last name.
