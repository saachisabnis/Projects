Sabrina Carpenter has announced her new tour will include a date at Birmingham's Utilita Arena. It comes as the star releases her latest album, Short n' Sweet next month.
The Espresso singer will kick off the tour in the US in September - with all 33 dates now sold out. She'll bring it over to the UK in March 2025, hitting Dublin, Birmingham, London, Glasgow and Manchester before heading across Europe.
The Utilita Arena show will take place on March 6, 2025. Fans who pre-order the new album will receive access to a pre-sale taking place at 12 noon on July 23. General sale tickets will go on sale at 10am on July 26.
Sabrina Carpenter was the opening act for several dates of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour. The last 12 months has also seen her perform at Coachella and Governors Ball, plus the iconic Saturday Night Live season finale.
Pre-sale for Sabrina’s newly-announced shows begins at 10am on July 23 for those pre-ordering the album, with artist presale and O2 presale opening at 12 noon. Venue pre-sale can be purchased on July 24, with Live Nation’s pre-sale on July 25. General sale tickets will be available from 10am on July 26.
You can find tickets through Ticketmaster, Live Nation and The Ticket Factory for the Birmingham show.
