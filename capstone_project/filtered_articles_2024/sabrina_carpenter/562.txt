Sabrina Carpenter was on the receiving end of several surprises over the weekend on her "Short N’ Sweet Tour." And during her second Los Angeles show at the Kia Forum on November 17th, she got a surprise visit from none other than Domingo himself (Saturday Night Live's Marcello Hernández).
When Sabrina spotted Hernández in the crowd, she asked where he was from, to which he replied, "I'm from Miami, baby." Then, "flustered," the "Bed Chem" singer asked what he was doing at her concert, and "Domingo" told her, "I’m the cute boy with the blue jacket and the thick accent" — a nod to her song.
Then, Carpenter asked Domingo, "Is there anything you want to say, before I arrest you, Domingo?" And he replied with one of his famous lines from the SNL sketch, tweaked just for Sabrina, "Came all this way, had to explain, direct from Domingo, Sabrina’s a friend, she’s like a sis, but I would hook up, though."

If you recall, Hernández's "Domingo" character was the subject of SNL's famous "Bridesmaid Speech" sketch, featuring Ariana Grande, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim and Sarah Sherman as they sing a song about their bachelorette trip at their friend's (Chloe Fineman) wedding, and their encounter with Domingo — all to the tune of Carpenter's hit "Espresso."
Following the sketch's debut on SNL, Sabrina shared the video on her Instagram stories, writing, "Very nice and on pitch."
