Find Out

Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan sparked dating rumors at the end of 2023 and have been inseparable ever since. However, a new report unveiled new details about their apparently “on and off” romance.
Find out the status of Sabrina and Barry’s relationship below. 
The “Feather” artist and the Saltburn star first met at Paris Fashion Week in September 2023. That December, they were spotted having dinner together in Los Angeles. At the time, however, it still wasn’t clear whether or not they were dating.
However, the pair officially— and inadvertently— confirmed their relationship in February 2024 after being seen making out at Sabrina’s Hollywood Hills home, per E! News. Over their pre-Valentine’s Day weekend, the two reportedly went out to Nobu together, then enjoyed another outing in the City of Angels a few days later.

In March 2024, Barry was spotted cheering on Sabrina while she performed as Taylor Swift‘s opening act during her Eras Tour in Singapore. After the show, he was seen wearing a hot pink friendship bracelet with the name “Sabrina” on it. That month, the two were photographed together at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party.

But it wasn’t until the May 2024 Met Gala when the couple made their red carpet debut. Since then, they’ve been inseparable. Barry even starred in Sabrina’s “Please Please Please” music video over the summer.
However, PEOPLE reported in August 2024 that the duo has an “on and off” relationship. Fans, therefore, speculated whether the pair were on a break after Barry shared an Instagram photo with his son, Brando, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Alyson Kierans.
Despite speculation, the Dunkirk actor took to Instagram to confirm their relationship once again. Reposting a photo from Sabrina’s account on his story, he referenced her new album, Short n’ Sweet, writing, “BED CHEM my fave just sayin m’darlin @sabrinacarpenter.” The post featured the “Espresso” singer cheesing and biting her nail, with a kiss mark visible on her upper back. He also encouraged his followers to stream her album.
Despite their flirtatious behavior and on-again, off-again romance, an insider told People in an article published on December 3, 2024, that “They are both young and career-focused, so they’ve decided to take a break” after about a year of dating.
Prior to dating Barry, Sabrina was linked to Shawn Mendes in early 2023, but the “Stitches” artist quickly shut down the rumor by saying they were “not dating” at the time. 
Sabrina’s most infamous past relationship, though, was with High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star Joshua Bassett. In 2020, the duo was spotted spending time together that summer in L.A. In the fall, they dressed up as Sharkboy and Lavagirl for Halloween. In 2021, Joshua’s other former girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo released her first album, SOUR, which many speculated was inspired by Sabrina and Joshua’s relationship. 
On Olivia’s hit single “Driver’s License,” she sings about “that blonde girl” who’s “older” than her, which fans believed was a hint about Sabrina, since she and Olivia have a four-year age gap. 
Four months before he and Sabrina were seen for the first time on a date, Barry broke up with Alyson. The former pair share son Brando together. 
During a January 2024 interview with GQ, the Masters of the Air actor spoke about his former girlfriend briefly, noting, “She’s done a great job, and she’s an incredible mother.” He didn’t divulge any details of their breakup to the publication at the time.
