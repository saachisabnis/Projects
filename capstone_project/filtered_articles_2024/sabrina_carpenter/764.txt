It’s Sabrina Carpenter‘s world, we’re just living in it! If the singer and actress has had a whirlwind of year, just imagine her last two months. Her instant sensation, ‘espresso’ dropped right before Coachella weekend one, and let’s just say it hit like a shot of espresso, an immediate song of the summer. From Sabrina Carpenter’s nails, clementine orange dress and white gogo boots to her infectious performance vibe, we are up.
She surprised everyone and dropped in at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend music festival over the weekend, which plays in a different city across the UK every year, this year in a town northwest of London called Luton. She wore a bright orange mini dress by the late great Roberto Cavalli and her platform white boots. She also had a very classic pearly white manicure on her nails, which were front and center when she reminded us that her give a fucks were on vacation. We, the short nailed girls, really needed the representation and inspiration.

Sabrina Carpenter’s appearance was a total surprise, as she dropped into Coldplay’s set to perform a mashup of ‘Fix You’ and ‘espresso.’ She also sang Coldplay’s song ‘Magic’ with Chris Martin.

It seems Sabrina Carpenter’s go to style move is a micro mini dress with a MAJOR boot or heel moment. And that makes sense given that she stands tall at 4 feet and 11 inches. Having a big leg moment really plays to our petite princess’ sexy doll-like Polly Pocket aesthetic. Last a few weeks ago, the Carpenter wore a very similar cut of dress in a satin golden yellow that she bought on Depop. She also very recently was seen in New York City wearing a geek chic outfit featuring the micro mini skirt from Miu Miu, and we LOVE that choice for her.
