Can Friends Kiss feels like a clap back to Taste
In the midst of loads of rumours regarding an apparent love triangle between Camila Cabello, Sabrina Carpenter and Shawn Mendes and with all the drama regarding the Taste video – Camila just dropped a deluxe edition of her album with a new song that people think is again talking about the Shawn and Sabrina saga. The Magic City edition of C,XOXO just dropped – and if you thought the whole June Gloom fiasco on the main record was addressing the Camila Cabello x Sabrina x Shawn triangle, wait til you hear the lyrics of the new track titled Can Friends Kiss.
Okay, for context – the lyrics and music video of Sabrina Carpenter’s number one single Taste are heavily rumoured to be about Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. Sabrina and Shawn had a brief fling, and Camila and Shawn were together for two years before breaking up but apparently having a little reunion fling circa last year’s Coachella.
Camila also released a song called June Gloom as the closer on C,XOXO – featuring lyrics that read “If she’s so amazing, why are you on this side of town? / If you like her so much, what are you here trying to find out? / Does she get this wet for you, baby? Talk to you in poems and songs, huh, baby?”

When Taste came out and Sabrina dropped Short N Sweet, Camila released a video of her lip-syncing to the most eyebrow raising part of June Gloom – it all felt very pointed.
Now Camila has dropped the new music, on Can Friends Kiss, Camila says lyrics like “Can friends kiss? Touch each other like this? / Undercover like this / Little too close, play your little song / And my mind is goin’ like this / Teasin’ on you like this, put it on you like this / Little too close, blame your conscience on / And my mind is goin’ like this.”
She continues “I don’t like your new girl, she don’t move me / When you talk about her, I get moody.” In the bridge, Camila adds: “Go and lock the door / Fall in love with me, I’m bored / We both know I’m yours.” Considering this is the first music Camila has dropped since Taste and Short N Sweet, it’s all very juicy.
Camila Cabello addressed the split from Shawn Mendes before Can Friends Kiss came out and set Sabrina Carpenter drama chats off again. She said on Call Her Daddy “You’re just kind of like, ‘It’s not a fit, it doesn’t feel right.’ Luckily, I was in a place in my life where it took me less time to realise that. It took us both less time to be like, ‘This doesn’t feel right and we don’t need to try so hard to make it work. It’s all good.’”
She added: “I will always care about him and love him. He’s such a good person and I’m lucky because some people have exes that are awful, and he is not. He’s a really kind, good person.”
