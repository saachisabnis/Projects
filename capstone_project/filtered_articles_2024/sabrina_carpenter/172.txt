Does Sabrina Carpenter ever sleep?!
Sabrina Carpenter is the polly pocket that’s taking over the world: She opened on the iconic Eras Tour, her song Espresso has just hit one billion streams, and her new album was released today to great reviews. But if I know anything about music, it’s that half of the game is being a boss businesswoman. Sabrina is pretty savvy with all of this stuff already and has released a surprising amount of products, on her own and in collaboration with other companies. Here’s a rundown of all of Sabrina Carpenter’s business ventures – is it that cheap? Oh hell no.

Remember this insanely expensive smoothie Sabrina released as a part of her Erewhon collab? It was a tropical smoothie infused with coconut and pineapple flavours. Sounds yummy but I think I’ll give it a miss at that price.

This was a very random side of her business ventures, and I still don’t know what would persuade me to get this Cash App card, but it is very cute and such a Sabrina Carpenter vibe.

Sabrina has released not one, not two but THREE fragrances, which you can buy as a trio for $90, or just under £70. They may be a tad pricey, but I’ve heard GLOWING things about them from fans.

This was literally the perfect promo for her single, Espresso. She slayed so hard while serving up coffee in Blank Street coffee shop, London. Great marketing moment here!

Although it’s pretty industry standard now, Sabrina’s merch is very expensive. This hoodie alone is £70, and while it’s got some pretty embroidery, that’s it. This is definitely a huge problem in the music world, and it’s not Sabrina’s fault alone, but she’s definitely contributing to it.
