Anyone who’s seen Sabrina Carpenter’s rhinestone-lined bath towel knows that, when it comes to her tour wardrobe, the singer leaves no stone unturned. “Jared just has such an amazing understanding of the idea in my head and how to elevate it times a thousand,” Carpenter told Vogue ahead of her hometown show in Philadelphia.
For Carpenter, the main criteria for her tour costumes was longevity. “What am I going to be able to last in onstage?” she says. “If I’m not [comfortable], the performance is two out of 10.” Still, an eternal performer, she knew that she wanted to deliver surprises for her fans, which she accomplishes by switching up the color of her looks. “The way we change it up is through colors and details and accessories and, like, little things here and there so that way I always know what I’m getting into every night, but the audience can feel like they’re seeing something new.”
In the second act, Carpenter layers a sheer babydoll dress over her glittering corset. “I have no insecurities—no thoughts about anything—because I’m just so comfortable in those little dresses,” she says of the flowy look. The babydoll silhouette first entered Carpenter’s wardrobe when she performed on SNL. Ellner credits Brigitte Bardot as inspirtation, while Carpenter shouts out musical theater references Grease and Bye Bye Birdie. “It’s kinda like—I mean you know better than me—but girlies getting ready,” Ellner says.
Bardot wasn’t the only blonde icon that the two turned to for inspiration. The second act catsuit nods to Marilyn Monroe, specifically “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” and Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face. “You can really see her movements because of the black,” Carpenter says. “It just looks so sleek.”
In this new series “Styling the Tour,” Sabrina Carpenter and Jared Ellner take Vogue behind the costumes of the Short N’ Sweet tour.
