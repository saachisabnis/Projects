It's bad news for 'Can't Blame a Girl For Trying' and 'Thumbs' truthers.
Sabrina Carpenter might have been nominated for Best New Artist at the 2025 Grammys but Short n' Sweet is actually her sixth studio album. Ahead of the release of the record, Sabrina opened up about why she feels a "separation" from her first four albums.
The Grammy-winning sensation may only just be topping the charts now with 'Espresso' and 'Please Please Please' but day one fans will already know that she's been releasing iconic music since 2014. From 'Can't Blame a Girl For Trying' to 'Sue Me', Sabrina has been releasing bops for over a decade.
However, Sabrina has now revealed that she doesn't identify with her early music and considers 'Short n' Sweet' to be her second album as an artist.

Speaking to Variety, Sabrina explained that she feels like a "new artist" even though she's just released her sixth album. 
In 2015, Sabrina released 'Eyes Wide Open' on Disney label Hollywood Records. Sabrina then released three more albums in her original contract ('Evolution', 'Singular: Act I', 'Singular: Act II') before signing with Island Records in 2021.
Reflecting on how she feels about her old music now, Sabrina said: "For the people who love those early records and listen to them, I love you for that. But I personally feel a sense of separation from them, largely due to the shift in who I am as a person and as an artist, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic."

Since signing to Island, Sabrina has reached new heights of success. Her critically-acclaimed 2022 album 'Emails I Can't Send' spawned the hit singles 'Nonsense' and 'Feather' and her new album 'Short n' Sweet' already lays claim to two Number 1s ('Espresso', 'Please Please Please').
Discussing how 'Short n' Sweet' fits into her career, Sabrina said: "It’s my second ‘big girl’ album; it’s a companion [to 'Emails I Can't Send'] but it’s not the same."
She continued: "When it comes to having full creative control and being a full-fledged adult, I would consider this a sophomore album."
Unlike her previous tours, Sabrina doesn't sing any songs from her first four albums on her Short n' Sweet Tour. 
During the Emails I Can't Send Tour, Sabrina included 'Can't Blame a Girl for Trying', 'Paris', 'Honeymoon Fades' and 'Sue Me'.
