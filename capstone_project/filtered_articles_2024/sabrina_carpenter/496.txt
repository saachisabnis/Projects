"Sabrina has partnered with PLUS1 on this tour to launch the Sabrina Carpenter Fund, which will support the well-being of people and animals, including national and local organizations working on the issues of mental health, animal welfare, and support for the LGBTQ+ community," event organizers said in a news release. 
A few months ago, NBC10's meteorologist Bill Henley shared a throwback interview he did with Sabrina more than a decade ago.
In the 2011 interview, Carpenter discussed being a guest star on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.
