Barry Keoghan is Sabrina Carpenter’s biggest fan!

	The Academy Award-nominated actor discussed his relationship with the “Feather” pop star during a recent episode of Spotify’s The Louis Theroux Podcast, where he was asked directly, “Are you in a relationship with Sabrina Carpenter?” 

	“Oh, I knew you’d do this,” Keoghan said with a laugh, before eventually explaining, “Listen, all I’m going to say is I’m incredibly blessed. Such a strong, independent lady who’s massively talented and yeah. Pretty special.”

	The pair first sparked dating rumors in late 2023, a few months before making their public debut at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty in March. Keoghan also starred opposite Carpenter in the music video for her Billboard Hot 100-topping single “Please Please Please,” which is featured on Short n’ Sweet. 

	










	After Carpenter dropped the album on Aug. 23, fans were quick to speculate that the Work It star wrote some of the project’s songs about the Irish actor — particularly the NSFW “Bed Chem.” “I was in a sheer dress the day that we met/ We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec,” she sings on the track. “Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? … Who’s the cute guy with the wide, blue eyes?”

	The Saltburn star definitely didn’t curb those rumors when he posted on Instagram Stories that “Bed Chem” is his favorite track on Short n’ Sweet. “just sayin m’darlin,” he added in his post, tagging Carpenter and including a link to her album. “Tap that link lads!!”
