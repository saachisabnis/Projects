Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso" may be THE song of the summer, and now fans get a chance to enjoy true pop synaesthesia as the singer has teamed up with an ice cream company to release a limited-edition flavor inspired by her hit.
Van Leeuwen Ice Cream announced its flavor of the summer, Espresso, available in scoop shops and online beginning June 28. The ice cream is a nod to Sabrina Carpenter's smash hit, "Espresso."
The decadent ice cream features an espresso-flavored base with brownie bites, chocolate chips, and fudge swirls which already has us begging "Please Please Please" for a double-scoop.
Check out Van Leeuwen's online store beginning June 28 to purchase a pint and have it shipped to you.
Van Leeuwen will also be serving the new flavor in its Scoop Shops nationwide; with locations in New York, California, Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Florida, and Connecticut, there may be a scoop shop near you.
Van Leeuwen is known for its limited-edition releases which feature unique flavor combos and collaborations with brands like Hidden Valley Ranch and Tapatio.
50% of profits from sales of Van Leeuwen's Sabrina Carpenter Espresso ice cream will go to benefit The Ali Forney Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing assistance and resources to unhoused LGBTQ+ teens.
Sabrina Carpenter's new album, Short n' Sweet, drops Aug. 23.
