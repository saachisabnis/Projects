	Halle’s spin on the track, which is set to feature on Carpenter’s highly-anticiapted upcoming album Short n’ Sweet, also received praise from artists like Perrie Edwards, GloRilla, Kehlani, as well as her sister Chlöe.

	










	Carpenter celebrated her first No. 1 on the Hot 100 with “Please Please Please,” which topped the chart on June 29.

	The singer shared the news via Instagram, posting an image of the Hot 100 graphic, as well as a video of her performing the song’s signature claps with co-writer and producer Jack Antonoff, co-writer Amy Allen, and engineer Laura Sisk.

	“MY FIRST #1 on the @billboard HOT 100!!!!!!!” reads Carpenter’s caption. “And espresso at #4.. I’m very immensely grateful so i will surely always remember this day for the rest of my life! @jackantonoff @amyallen i deeply love this song and i love you both!!!!! I love our pitchy claps!!!!! I love @sharp_stick [Sisk] !!!! good things come in three’s. thank you everyone who’s listened and made it so much fun to have these songs out in the world. more to come soon.”

	Carpenter currently boasts the top song in the world, as “Espresso” rebounds for a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and brews up an eighth week atop the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. survey.

	Notably, “Espresso” ties for the longest command on Global Excl. U.S. this year, matching the No. 1 run of Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things.”
