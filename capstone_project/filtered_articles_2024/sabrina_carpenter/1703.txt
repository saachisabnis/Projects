Dua Lipa led off the 31st Billboard Music Awards winning the honors for Top Dance/Electronic Song for Houdini on Thursday night, with Michelle Buteau as hosting from the W Hollywood hotel.
'Wow, this is so cool,' Dua Lipa, 31, said in her acceptance speech from a remote location, as she was unable to attend due to touring obligations. 'Thank you so much. Thank you for all the love and the support and for dancing with me to Houdini.

The London-born songstress, who was also nominated in the category for her single Illusion, said, 'I'm currently on tour in Asia during the Radical Optimism tour ... but I'll be in a city close to you very soon. So come down, let's carry on dancing. Lots of love.'
