	Don’t expect Sabrina Carpenter to order an espresso any time soon.

	The 25-year-old pop star sat down with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe to discuss her album Short n’ Sweet, which arrives on Friday (Aug. 23). The project features the catchy, instantly viral single “Espresso” that Carpenter released in the spring and was written between tours. When Lowe admitted that he no longer drinks the coffee beverage, Carpenter joked, “I didn’t invent espresso. The Italians are so mad.”

	She continued, “What’s so crazy, this is the part of me that feels like an idiot. Every time I see a cafe, there’s just a sign that says espresso, and I’m like, ‘Yes.’ Nothing to do with me,” to which Lowe playfully replied, “You’re a monster.”

	“I do have to question ordering [espressos] a lot now,” she added. “They’re just waiting for me to say it and I’m like, ‘Tea.'”

	Of her upcoming sixth studio album, Carpenter explained, “I called it Short n’ Sweet for multiple reasons. It was not because I’m vertically challenged. It was really like I thought about some of these relationships and how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most.” 

	The pop star added, “I think about the way that I respond to situations, and sometimes it is very nice and sometimes it’s not very nice. And again, the thing about albums, projects, writing songs, it’s all moments. So harder for other people to understand that when they’re listening to something that’s going to take them through maybe a lot of years, hopefully a lot of years, is that I’m not the same person that I was when I wrote that.”
