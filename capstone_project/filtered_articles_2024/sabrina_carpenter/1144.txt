The singer has been changing the lyrics as she tours with the pop superstar.

	When Sabrina Carpenter first released Emails I Can’t Send in July 2022, nobody expected “Nonsense” to take on a life of its own in the way that it has. While flashier songs like “Fast Times” and “Because I Liked a Boy” got a lot of initial attention, it was “Nonsense” that grew into the set’s runaway hit — thanks, in no small part, to Carpenter’s hilarious improvised outros on her global Emails I Can’t Send Tour.

	In essence, every night Carpenter performs “Nonsense,” she changes the lyrics of the outro on the fly. Sometimes she’s simply paying tribute to the city in which she’s performing — and, other times, she’s testing how far she can push the limits of sexually suggestive lyrics.

	The original “Nonsense” outro reads: “This song catchier than chickenpox is/ I bet your house is where my other sock is/ Woke up this morning, thought I’d write a pop hit, ha-ha/ How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz.”

	“Nonsense” peaked at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, her second career entry on the chart; the single also reached the top 10 on Pop Airplay (No. 10). Emails I Can’t Send debuted and peaked at No. 23, becoming the highest peaking and longest charting LP of her career.

	Taylor Swift announced on June 2, 2023, that she would be bringing her record-breaking Eras Tour to Latin America, with Carpenter serving as her opener across the summer and fall in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. She would also open Eras Tour shows in Australia and Singapore from Feb. 16-March 9, 2024. 

	Naturally, the singer-songwriter brought her “Nonsense” outro shenanigans to her first couple Eras Tour performances, and she’s already gifted fans with a number of hilarious renditions of the track. From Mexico to Singapore and beyond, here’s every “Nonsense” outro Sabrina Carpenter has performed on the Eras Tour so far:

	For the Aug. 24 Eras Tour show — the first of four consecutive nights at Mexico City’s Foro Sol stadium — Sabrina sang: “I only date him if he pays my rent-ay/ If you are a Swiftie, you’re mi gente/ Let me hear you make some noise DF.”

	“He said where you at, I said ‘I’m busy’/ Sipping on tequila getting tipsy/ Con mis chicas in Mexico City,” the Disney alum quipped.

	“I’m full grown but I look like a niña/ Come put something big in my casita/ Mexico, I think you are bonita!”

	Some fans heard a slightly more NSFW of this outro, replacing “casita” with “pusita.”

	“How to ride it, I can think of 5 ways/ My head goes so hard I’m giving migraines/ How loud do you get in Buenos Aires,” the “Feather” singer joked on opening night of the Eras Tour mini-residency in Argentina.

	For the second Buenos Aires Eras Tour show — which was postponed due to “truly chaotic” weather — Sabrina closed out “Nonsense” with, “He said, ‘What’s your name?’ I said ‘Sabrina’/ Saw that obelisco, said ‘que linda’/ Who’s the loudest here in Argentina?”

	For the final Buenos Aires Eras Tour show, Carpenter sang, “When I’m in the bedroom looking sexy/ He’s having a ball, he call me ‘Messi’/ Argentina, will you be my bestie?” —  a nod to Argentine football icon Lionel Messi.

	For the first Rio de Janeiro Eras Tour stop, the “Feather” singer played on one of Brazil’s signature drinks: “Sipping on me like a caipirinha/ How to turn me on, boy, I can teach ya/ My new name is ipanema ‘Brina”

	The second Rio de Janeiro Eras Tour stop — which was staged at Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos like the other two dates — featured Carpenter singing, “It’s kinda small, but I don’t even care though/ Cupid must have hit me with an arrow/ ‘Cause I’m in love with Rio de Janeiro!”

	For the final Rio de Janeiro Eras Tour stop — which was rescheduled from its original Nov. 18 date to extreme heat — found the “Skin” singer joking, “Boy come over, this is not a drill/ He said, ‘Get on top,’ I said, ‘I will’/ Then he made me come… to Brazil!”

	For her first night on the Australian leg of the Eras Tour (Feb. 16), Sabrina Carpenter took the Aussies right into the deep end with the salacious “Nonsense” outro — and she also impressed some locals with her knowledge of the proper pronunciation of the city’s name.

	“D-I-C-K I am good at spelling/ Tastes so good, I need a second helping/ Aren’t you glad I know how to say Melbourne,” she crooned.

	The “Nonsense” outros aren’t all raunchy! For her second night in Melbourne (Feb. 17), she poked fun at her relationship with alcohol.

	“I don’t say ‘Hello,’ I say ‘G’day, mate!’/ I don’t make a bevvy, I’m a lightweight/ Melbourne, I just came, I saw, and I ate,” she sang.

	For her final night opening up for Taylor Swift at Melbourne Cricket Ground (Feb. 18), Sabrina Carpenter packed on the faux regret and hilariously relayed the process of leaving an old flame who couldn’t keep up in bed.

	“Broke up ’cause the size was underwhelming/ Tried to give him pointers, wasn’t helping/ Maybe, I just need a boy from Melbourne,” she sang.

	Although she was unable to perform her set the first night of the Eras Tour’s stint in Sydney (Feb. 23-26) due to the weather, Sabrina Carpenter was able to make it for Night 2 (Feb. 24). For that evening’s “Nonsense” outro, she opted to bring back the raunch.

	“When you go down under, do you miss me?/ He’s so big, I felt it in my kidney/ Screamed so loud they heard it here in Sydney!” she joked.

	For the third show in Sydney (Feb. 25), the singer chose to temper her sultry side with a nod to the thick, dark brown spread known as Vegemite.

	“Yeah, he’s pretty cute but will our kids be? This country’s so big I hope it fit me/ I Vegemite be in love with you, Sydney,” she sang.

	For her final night in Sydney’s Accor Stadium (Feb. 26), Carpenter delivered what just might be her funniest “Nonsense” outro yet — and it’s all thanks to her play on the Australian pronunciation of the word “no/nah,” which has been a long-running Internet meme.

	“I can’t believe a plane can fly this far/ I met the cutest Aussie at the bar/ He said, ‘Are you from here?’ I said ‘Naur,'” she sang as the stadium went wild.

	For her first night in Singapore’s National Stadium (Mar. 2), Sabrina played on how she prefers to keep herself, ahem, Down Under.

	“Gardens by the Bay, I wanna go there / Then, I’ll take you somewhere that has no hair / Singapore you’re so perfect, it’s no fair,” she winkingly crooned.

	Singapore Night 2 brought along both a reference to the gorgeous Jewel Changi — an entertainment and retail complex that features an enormous waterfall structure — and a sweet reaction from Carpenter’s Oscar-nominated beau Barry Keoghan. The Saltburn actor cheered as she sang:

	“He said that he wishes he was on me / Got me wetter than the Jewel Changi / Singapore, I hope you like my songy!”

	For her third consecutive night at Singapore’s National Stadium (March 4), Sabrina had to tweet a clarification after the show because some fans misheard her one of freestyle lyrics as “almond” instead of “omelette.”

	“This crowd ate me up like I’m an omelette/ I swear I’m coming back here, that’s a promise/ You cleared all my Singa-pores, I’m flawless,” she sang.

	For Night 4 of the Eras Tour’s stint at Singapore’s National Stadium, Sabrina doubled down on her penchant for innuendo.

	“Told that boy to sit me down on all fours/ I told that boy go faster, now I’m all sore/ You hit a little different here, Singapore,” she crooned.
