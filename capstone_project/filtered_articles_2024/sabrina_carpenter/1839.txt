	Isn’t the Girls Meet World cast sweet? I guess so! 

	Sabrina Carpenter is fresh off two top 5 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with “Espresso” hitting No. 3 on the all-genre songs tally and “Please Please Please” marking the pop star’s first chart-topper. 

	To celebrate her recent success, her two former Girls Meet World co-stars, August Maturo and Ava Kolker, took to TikTok to share a sweet video. “How you guys know Sabrina vs. how we know Sabrina,” Maturo wrote over a clip of himself and Kolker lip syncing along to “Espresso” before a series of photo of the duo posing with Carpenter on the Disney Channel series set flashed on the screen.
