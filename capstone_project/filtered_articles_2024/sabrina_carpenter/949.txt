In an Instagram video posted on Thursday (September 19), Sabrina Carpenter announced that she will be hosting a holiday special on Netflix entitled, A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter, which will premiere on December 6 at 9 p.m. The pop superstar – who currently holds the Billboard No. 1 album in the country along with three Top 10 singles in the Hot 100 chart – looks to conquer the Christmas season as well by releasing her first-ever holiday special which “features unexpected duets and comedic guests.” The show’s playful teaser clip features Carpenter dressed festively for the Christmas season as she smirks while saying, “Expecting someone else?” 
The post is captioned, “This is really gonna jingle your bells,” which reinforces the comedic nature of the special. “The holidays have always been so special to me,” Carpenter said in a statement. “I am excited to bring my take to a classic holiday variety show — infusing my love of music and comedy to make something that is uniquely me.” (Billboard)
