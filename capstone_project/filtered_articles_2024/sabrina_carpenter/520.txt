Carpenter, much like Minaj, isn't feeling Travis releasing multiple albums to allegedly prevent her from going No. 1.

Sabrina Carpenter ain’t too fond of Travis Scott releasing multiple versions of his LP to secure the No. 1 spot on the charts. Sabrina and Travis are currently caught in a close battle for the coveted placement on the Billboard 200.

	Carpenter, who recently dropped her sixth studio album, Short N’ Sweet, on Friday (Aug. 23), took to X/Twitter to vent her frustrations with Scott with a simple message: “This one’s for Nicki.”

Nicki Minaj noticed the message and showed the breakout star some love, understanding the post’s significance. During an Instagram Live session later that night, Minaj gave Carpenter some encouragement, saying, “Shout out Sabrina Carpenter, shout out all the Sabrina Carpenter fans.”

	










	Travis Scott issued a re-release of his Days Before Rodeo mixtape to DSPs to celebrate the work’s tenth anniversary on Sunday (Aug. 18). As of Friday (Aug. 30), Scott has released a total of six deluxe versions of the album consisting of Vault 1, Vault 2, Vault 3, Vault 4, Live from Atlanta, and Chopped & Screwed.

	All versions can only be purchased through the artist’s website, with Vault 3 & 4 offering two new unreleased songs. The multiple editions of the album are sure to bolster Scott’s album sales significantly‚ but Sabrina looked at it like he was gaming the system, which she took issue with.

	This isn’t the first time Scott has released multiple versions of his album to secure the spot on the charts. In fact, he pulled the strategy off back when he released Astroworld in 2018.

	Nicki Minaj released her album, Queen, on Aug. 10, 2018, a week after Scott’s blockbuster album. Astroworld beat out Minaj for the No. 1 spot, and she responded to the news with her infamous rant about the “auto-tune man.” She accused the Houston native of trying to cheat the system with merchandise bundles to land atop the charts.

	“What we’re not gonna do is have that auto-tune man selling f**king sweaters. Telling you he sold half a million albums, because he f**king didn’t. You stupid f**k. You got your f**king homeboy talking for you and you got your girlfriend selling tour passes. Stop it. Knock it the f**k off,” she said at the time.
