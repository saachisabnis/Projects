Every week, Billboard unveils the top 10 songs on the latest Hot 100 chart. The most recent rankings, for the chart dated June 29, are out now, so let’s run down who had this week’s biggest hits.
Eilish’s latest favorite has so far soared to a peak at No. 9, and it’s just a spot off that this week.
Swims switched spots with Eilish as “Lose Control” makes a moderate leap on the new chart.
“Beautiful Things” has spent a lot of time in the top-10, and while it was outside at No. 11 last week, it’s back this time around at No. 8.
In addition to being top-10, “Too Sweet” is No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart for a second week, No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a 12th week, and No. 1 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart for an 11th week.
Drake is in this week’s top-10, although not how he’d likely prefer: as the target of Kendrick Lamar’s former No. 1 hit.
Richman’s viral hit is on top of the Hot R&B Songs chart for an eighth week and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for a third week.
Carpenter has become quite the hit-maker lately as “Espresso” hangs around the top 5 at No. 4.
“A Bar Song” previously peaked at No. 3, and now it returns to that spot after a strong week.
Of course a Post Malone and Morgan Wallen song was going to go No. 1, and of course even after it lost that spot, it wouldn’t tumble too far.
Big congratulations to Carpenter! After “Espresso” achieved her previous biggest Hot 100 peak at No. 3, “Please Please Please” has reached the summit to become Carpenter’s first-ever No. 1 single. Also, since Jack Antonoff co-wrote the song, it’s now his seventh chart-topper as a writer and/or producer.
