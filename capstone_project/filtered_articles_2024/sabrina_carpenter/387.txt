Shania Twain laughed as she declared herself “the hottest Mrs. Claus there’s ever been.”
The legendary country star performed “Santa Baby” during her recent show in Las Vegas in honor of her duet with Sabrina Carpenter, who recently premiered her new holiday special, A Nonsense Christmas, on Netflix. The star-studded special features duets and cameos by Twain and other celebrities.
“This is really cool because on Netflix I am on a Christmas special. It’s Sabrina Carpenter’s Christmas special,” Twain told the Vegas crowd in a video she shared on Instagram on Thursday (December 12). “And her and I did a duet together. She invited me, and I was so excited to do it. And on top of that, I got to play Mrs. Claus in this special. I’m telling you, if I must say so myself, I’m the hottest Mrs. Claus there’s ever been,” she said with a laugh. “I’m just saying, I’m owning it, man. Like apparently me and Santa have been married for like 400 years. I’m owning the hot part. You’ve got to have fun with Christmas.”
