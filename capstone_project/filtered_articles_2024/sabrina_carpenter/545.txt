Sabrina Carpenter is no stranger to the music business. With six studio albums to her name, she’s been making music for a decade already. But 2024 was without a doubt her breakout year — here’s a look at everything the pint-sized pop star accomplished:
-On March 9, Sabrina ended her run opening for Taylor Swift on The Eras Tour. Her final appearance as the special guest for the most successful tour of all time took place in Singapore at Singapore National Stadium.
-On April 11, Sabrina released her single “Espresso.”
-The next day was a big one for Sabrina: on April 12, she not only released the music video for “Espresso,” but she also made her Coachella debut, where she headlined and played “Espresso” live for the first time.
-Sabrina also played at Coachella’s second weekend on April 19.
-On May 2, Sabrina attended the Met Gala with her then-boyfriend, Barry Keoghan. They dressed in outfits inspired by Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter.
-Live from New York, it’s Sabrina Carpenter. On the May 18 episode, she made her Saturday Night Live debut as the musical guest, where she performed her hit “Espresso,” and a mash-up of “Feather” and “Nonsense.” During the bridge of “Feather,” she changed the lyrics from “I’m so sorry for your loss!” to “I’m on SNL and you’re not!”
