Honey, I did NOT eliminate Ariana Grande.  I stated I was iffy on her Best Pop Duo/Group Performance chances, which means she will probably happen.  Also, never eliminated Sabrina Carpenter in Pop.  Just mentioned she is NOT winning.  I expect a bunch of random nominees like last year in Duo/Group.  The category is a total shitfest.
Fair enough. I lose track of the number of things you call pure delusion that it’s hard to pin down just exactly what you actually believe

I feel like pop solo performance usually goes to somebody who doesn’t win the GF field awards, if not just one. For example, miley one bpsp and got one GF, adele didn’t get any GF, olivia didn’t get any GF, harry didn’t get any GF, lizzo didn’t get any GF, gaga didn’t get any GF, ed didn’t get any GF, etc etc. Kinda makes me think that it won’t go to Sabrina because I think shes securing one of the main song categories. Maybe billie pulls a miley and just wins roty and bpsp, but sabrina I think is gonna win more than 2 awards. 
If this is true, then I can see Good Luck, Babe! or we can’t be friends (wait for you love) winning BPSP

 Agreed! or maybe taylor walks away with psp for icdiwabh and then thats all she wins (perhaps the music film award too)

Lana Del Rey was nominated last year because of her album and Jon Batiste’s as well. She’s not getting name-checked two years in a row when voters have to scroll down all the way to Q as in Quavo.
Get real!  For the billionth time, “Yes, And?” is NOT happening in Best Dance Pop Recording.  Pure delusion.

Is it really pure delusion? This place has it in the #1 spot. 
I’m trying to remember what it sounds like without cheating by playing it. That song has vanished from radio.

I feel like if Billie submits lunch instead of BOAF, shes not gonna win any song awards. Theres a reason that lil nas underperformed at a lot of award shows including the grammys for his montero era but not his debut. It’s unfortunately too controversial and I just can’t see how the voters would pick lunch over the other competitive options.
Childish Gambino’s new album is classified as pop.
I wonder if he’ll get in a few pop categories

 I very much doubt it, I also don’t feel like its a pop album
BPVA and BPSP feel very crowded this year, there’s so many contenders.
For BPVA, I would say Ariana, Billie and Taylor are absolute locks. Sabrina is basically a lock too, I just say not as absolute since she has no previous Grammy nominations to base it on. The fifth slot is difficult for me to predict between Dua and Chappell. Dua is of course a previous BPVA winner and whilst Radical Optimism wasn’t as successful as Future Nostalgia, I’d be shocked if she missed BPVA especially because she’s been promoting it so much. But then, Chappell is having a moment right now and I could also see her getting in.
I hope Gaga isn’t dropping in August now, because that’ll make things even more complicated!

There are some obvious pop songs but I’d personally classify it as alternative. It really doesn’t have a definitive genre. 
Donald should be placed in Alternative, but he’s getting placed in Progressive R&B again.
Get real!  Childish Gambino is NOT happening in the Pop Field.  Pure delusion.  In fact, he’s NOT happening in any category.
