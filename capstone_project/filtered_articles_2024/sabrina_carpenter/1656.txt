	Espresso martinis, anyone? On Thursday, Saturday Night Live announced the guests for the last two episodes of Season 49: Maya Rudolph will take on hosting duties with a performance from Vampire Weekend on May 11, while Sabrina Carpenter will perform on May 18 with Jake Gyllenhaal hosting.

	“SABRINA NIGHT LIVE 😭😭😭😭,” Carpenter wrote on Instagram sharing the news.

	As many Swifties noticed about the May 18 SNL, there’s a Taylor Swift-tinged invisible string tying Gyllenhaal to Carpenter. The Brokeback Mountain actor dated Swift, whom Carpenter opened for on the Eras Tour over the last several months. (It might be a stretch, but for those who’ll be Googling Swift’s tour dates to see if Swift could make an appearance at 30 Rock… Swift has a show in Stockholm that night.)

	Appearing on the season finale, Gyllenhaal makes his return to SNL to promote his new film Road House after making an appearance in January 2007 and 2022. Carpenter — who has gained loads of popularity since dropping her album Emails I Can’t Send in 2022 — is making her SNL debut.

	Meanwhile, Rudolph is a Saturday Night Live veteran. She was a cast member from 2000 to 2007 and won an Emmy for her portrayal of Vice President Kamala Harris as well. This is her third time hosting the show, while Vampire Weekend returns for their fourth musical guest appearance.

	The announcement comes two days before Dua Lipa is set to take on double-duty as musical guest and episode host on SNL this weekend in celebration of her new album, Radical Optimism.
