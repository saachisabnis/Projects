Undoubtedly, Sabrina Carpenter is one of the fastest rising names in Hollywood. The 25-year-old singer/actress has released six different studio albums since 2016. Her most recent collection, Short n’ Sweet, currently has her on a worldwide tour.
On All Hallows Eve, Carpenter’s tour placed her at American Airlines Arena in Dallas, Texas. During the show, the pop star took a magnified moment to reveal herself in a dazzling Playboy Bunny suit. The crowd responded with a raucous roar of approval.

It’s nice to see Sabrina Carpenter getting into the spooky season spirit, especially in an iconic Bunny suit. Of course, Wednesday evening’s performance in Dallas was her final show of October, so donning some sort of costume was expected.

Carpenter isn’t working on Halloween night, but the superstar will resume her Short n’ Sweet Tour on Friday, November 1 in Denver, Colorado. The tour has been wildly successful to this point, as her expansive fanbase has been well represented.

Naturally, Sabrina Carpenter won’t be the only person dressed in the famous Playboy Bunny suit this Halloween. The wardrobe has become as much a part of the holiday as candy corn or a Spirit Superstore.
