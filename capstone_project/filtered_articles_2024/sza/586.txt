SZA has three more “LANA” tracks to give.
On Monday, December 30, the 4-time Grammy winner revealed on X, formerly Twitter, that additional songs will be added to “LANA,” the expanded edition of her 2022 album “SOS.” The reissue was released on December 20 with 15 tracks, including “BMF,” “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” and “30 for 30,” featuring Kendrick Lamar, who SZA will hit the road with for the Grand National Tour this summer. On the updated version of “LANA,” which arrives on January 6, 2025, is “Take You Down,” a reworked “Open Arms” and “PSA,” which was heard in an “SOS” teaser.
“Just got word all updated Mixes and new songs will be added Jan 6th when the label comes back from holiday,” SZA wrote on X. “Sorry they can’t do it any sooner 🥹. Just wanted to keep yall in the loop ❤️Thank yall for your patience ❤️”
The singer-songwriter later shared plans to upload a “correct” mix of “Kitchen,” which appeared on the original “LANA” tracklist.
The “LANA” drop proved successful for “SOS” just two years after its release, as the album returned to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week ending December 26. After the delayed “LANA” rollout, which was released late on December 20, SZA revealed on Christmas Day, December 25, that she’d no longer be managed by Top Dawg Entertainment president Terrence “Punch” Henderson Jr.
“Nothing to celebrate. The end of an era. I wish him the best, whatever his choices may be,” SZA wrote on Instagram. “And to be clear, I love Punch deeply! No one should be attacking him or being cruel on my behalf. Sometimes, people grow apart, and that’s okay.”
