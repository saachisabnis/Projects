Greg James didn't attend the BRIT Awards on Saturday evening - but revealed what he did with his tickets after skipping the ceremony.
The Radio 1 DJ, 38, sweetly gave away his two tickets to the 2024 Brit Awards to a couple from Wales and even volunteered for babysitting duties.
Not only did Charlie and Meg get to attend the star-studded bash in London's O2 arena - they also got Greg to look after their children.
In a shock move that delighted fans, Greg revealed he travelled all the way to Wales to look after the couple's daughter Maisie, seven.
Greg took to Instagram to explain his decision, writing in the caption: 'Brits day! Welcome to the alternative coverage which will be from Swansea! Ps. This was almost a proper stack.'

Meg commented: 'And we are forever grateful, thank you so much. We'll make sure the heating is on for you to warm up. Maisie is very excited! @greg_james.'
Greg shared a photo of himself and Maisie poking their faces through a toy castle with the caption 'Sorry haven't updated in a while - we been busy playing dolls' 
He then shared a hilarious list of 'chores' Maisie had written up for him, including 'salon time' and dishwashing with 'pink gloves'.
At the Brits, Raye broke records, winning six gongs during a star-studded ceremony at London's O2 arena.
The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada. 
Meg commented: 'And we are forever grateful, thank you so much. We'll make sure the heating is on for you to warm up. Maisie is very excited! @greg_james'

As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
Dua Lipa picked up the fan-voted Pop Act gong, gushing to her fans: 'I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I'm standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me.' 
A record 98 artists were up for the new 2024 BRIT award, which has been designed by British visual artist and painter Rachel Jones.
The only men to get accolades were Calvin Harris for dance act; Sheffield quartet Bring Me The Horizon in the alternative/rock category; Casisdead for best hip-hop, grime or rap act; and duo Jungle for group of the year. 
Miley Cyrus was a notable absentee on the night, sending her thanks for her International Song win for her smash hit Flowers in a video message.
'Hello to everybody at the Brits. I wanted to say thank you so much for voting Flowers as the international song of the year, and a special thank you for giving me somewhere to wear this dress, she said, showing off her minuscule gold number.
'It's incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.' 
Dua Lipa and Ellie Goulding pulled out all the stops as they led the performances. Double nominee Dua, 28, opened the ceremony with her new song Training Season from her upcoming her third studio album.
