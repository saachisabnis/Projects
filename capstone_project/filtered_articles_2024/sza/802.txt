SZA is opening up about her BBL and admits that she somewhat regrets it.

	Of her body augmentation, the SOS singer confessed to British Vogue, “I’m so mad I did that s**t.”

	She continued, “I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat. It was just so stupid. But who gives a f**k? You got a BBL, you realise you didn’t need the s**t. It doesn’t matter.”

	Despite her regrets, SZA also doesn’t care. “I’ll do a whole bunch more s**t just like it if I want to before I’m f**king dead because this body is temporary. It just wasn’t super necessary – I have other s**t that I need to work on about myself… I need to get my f**king mental health together […] But I love my butt. Don’t get me wrong. My booty look nice. And I’m grateful that it looks pretty much… I don’t know, sometimes natural, but I don’t even care. It’s something that I wanted. I’m enjoying it. I love shaking it.”

	SZA also got candid about the “psychosis of fame,” noting that she admittedly feels that being famous isn’t for her. “Every day I grapple with, ‘Am I done with music?’ Maybe I’m just not meant to be famous – I’m crashing and burning and behaving erratically. It’s not for me because I have so much anxiety,” the 35-year-old explained. 

	She later questioned, “Why would God put me in this position if I wasn’t supposed to be doing this? So I just keep trying to rise to the occasion. But I’m also just like, ‘Please, the occasion is beating my a**.’”

	SZA concluded the story by speaking on her highly anticipated album, Lana. 

	Of the new music, she shared, “I think I am making music from a more beautiful place. From a more possible place versus a more angsty place. I’m not identifying with my brokenness. It’s not my identity. It’s sh*t that happened to me. Yeah, I experienced cruelty. I have to put it down at some point. Piece by piece, my music is shifting because of that, the lighter I get.”

	There’s no word on when the album will be released.
