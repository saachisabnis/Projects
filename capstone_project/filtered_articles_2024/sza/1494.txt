Although the original series was renewed, not much progress has been made since its 2022 debut. With SZA lighting a fire under the production team, things could change soon. Even so, SZA decided to issue a playful apology for her strong language.
“Omg,” she wrote. “Please accept my humble apology 🥹 LMAO. Whenever you’re ready is fine 😩.  [I’m] just dying of thirst. It’s the best show ever! You’re a madman 🫡. Thank you, Mr. Stiller, king sir!”
