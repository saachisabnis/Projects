Kids these days simply can’t get studious without the background noise of a Netflix series or a perfect playlist. Playboy Creator Kylie Hammonds’ favorite music to hit the books to is the legendary “SOS” SZA album.
“I love her music because I listen to it almost every single day while studying. It’s just so girly, and kind of soft…I just love how it expresses her feelings about what’s going on in her mind,” Kylie told Playboy.
After her raucous 2017 debut “Ctrl,” SZA went hard to work on her sophomore album. She boasted collaborations with fellow music industry big wigs, including Post Malone and Justin Timberlake. 
Some of these collabs didn’t come through by the time the album was released, but SZA did collaborate with Pharrell Williams, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Travis Scott, and Phoebe Bridgers. 
The album gets its name from the distress signal that means “Save our souls.” It’s also a nod to SZA’s nickname with friends, Sous, which is a shortening of her first name, Solána. The cover of the album harkens to a popular 1997 photo of Princess Diana, taken on a trip to Portofino, Italy.
“SOS” was an instant hit, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200, and eventually went on to win a Grammy, a BET Award, and an iHeartRadio Music Award, among other accolades. 
Kylie is currently studying for the bar, and usually has SZA on in the background. Her favorite song from the album is “Blind,” a song that delves into the damaging effects of toxic relationships.
“I think it’s the one everyone knows off of TikTok,” Kylie said. “I’ve listened to that like, a million times.”
