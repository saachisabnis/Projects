For SZA fans, the wait is over. The TDE songstress confirmed that “Lana,” the deluxe edition of her critically acclaimed SOS album, will drop this Friday, December 20.
After teasing fans with a mysterious trailer last week, the “Snooze” hitmaker upped the excitement with another playful preview. The latest clip stars Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who channels a passionate SZA superfan, lip-syncing to a track believed to be titled “Drive” as he drives through a rainy night.

The teaser continues the earthy, unconventional vibe of her earlier “Lana” trailer, which featured the singer crouching by a woodland stream. The atmospheric video included a snippet of The Isley Brothers’ classic “Voyage to Atlantis,” paired with the cryptic caption, “Clock starts now. Happy anniversary.”
SZA’s SOS has already cemented its place in music history, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and becoming the first R&B album by a female artist to achieve such a feat since Mariah Carey’s 1991 debut. With Lana now confirmed, anticipation is higher than ever.
