FRANKLIN, Wis. (CBS 58) -- A lot of weekend festivals have gotten rained out. 
The Tacos and Tequila Fest was shut down. 
Police made the call after 8:30 p.m. tonight, due of the severe weather. 
The festival started at 2 p.m. on Saturday, June 22. 
When CBS 58 was out at the festival, the people weren't letting the rain keep them down, but organizers knew it would be coming. 
"Our attendees are our most important thing, right? We want to make sure everyone stays safe and has a good time," said Joshua James, vice president of Social House Entertainment. 
James says he hopes to make this festival an annual event in Franklin, but hopefully with some sunshine headlining next year. 
In Walworth County, a big night was canceled at the Alpine Music Theater. 
Dave Matthews Band was set to play there tonight but had to be postponed due to severe weather. According to the band's X page, the show has now been rescheduled for next Sunday, June 30. Tickers for last night's show will be honored, and if you can't go next week, you can receive a refund. 
Summerfest also experienced a weather delay. Headliner Sza was set to perform at 7:30 p.m. The gates were closed, not allowing access for individuals to get into the grounds. Festival goers were told to take shelter. Many fans waited out for the Sza concert on the grounds. 
 According to Summerfest, the gates reopened around 9:40 p.m.
