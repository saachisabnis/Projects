Anyway, my prediction about GUTS winning AOTY increased. It seems that SZA and Victoria are gonna split the votes.
Victoria isn’t in AOTY but Janelle is though !
 Victoria isn’t in AOTY but Janelle is though ! 
 my opinion on this is that anyone who thinks that sza is locked in for progressive r&b, shouldn’t be worried that janelle’s gonna take votes from her in aoty. one ballot does not mean anything, it’s obvious that SOMEONE would vote for janelle. and i doubt the voters would wanna split between aoty and progressive r&b because most of them know that sza has a chance to win and janelle doesn’t.
 Lmao, Anti-Hero is obviously much bigger than DSN, Idk if you’re trolling or not. AH went #1 in US, UK, Australia and Canada unlike DSN which didn’t go #1 in any of those countries. I remember the DSN chart run. It wasn’t that strong, it was kinda carried by radio. It only gained traction after massive airplay exposure and like 20 diff performances. You chose the wrong Dua song for this comparison. Levitating, on the other hand was a mega smash and it’s an actual bigger hit than AH. Weeks at #1: AH: 8, DSN: 0 (peaked at #2) Weeks in Top 10: AH: 28, DSN: 20 BB Greatest of All Time chart points: AH: ~900k, DSN: ~650k 
Don’t Start Now is way bigger globally. Come on now, everyone know that.

There’s no clear favorite in AOTY, the competition is too close but I think the record is the frontrunner. Its nom in Best Engineered put it in advantage but surely that’s not a guarantee. I wonder what Country and Rap community will pick tho.
Sexy, confident. So intelligent.
She is heaven-sent. So soft, so strong.
Vulture had SZA winning AOTY and Taylor winning Record and Song of the Tear.

 rap is picking sza, next
Thanks for showing the stats of ONE country, let’s see the global stats:
YEC
Spotify: DSN #5, AH #10
Apple Music: DSN #6, AH #6
Deezer: DSN #4, AH #7
US: DSN #4, AH #4
AUS: DSN #3, AH #4
UK: DSN #6, AH #4
Can: DSN #3, AH #5
Germany: DSN #19, AH #18
South Korea (Gaon): DSN #33, AH N/A
France: DSN #36, AH N/A
Spain: DSN #38, AH N/A
DSN debuted in the Spotify GLOBAL top 10 and stayed there for +9 months, the only country that took months to finally get into the wagon was the US.
And the fact that AH will never reach DSN streams, views or certifications. You tried.
Now this is misleading when Anti-Hero was caught between years.

that would be perfect. 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
I might be wrong but I doubt Taylor will win ROTY or SOTY. Anti-Hero isn’t the type of song(a ballad, or nostalgic uplifting tracks) that wins in the GF(actually, not even in Pop.), and the only thing that would make it the frontrunner would be:
1) A clean sweep
2) It being the biggest hit
Taylor never swept and I don’t think that’s gonna change. And Flowers is a much bigger hit. Taylor is also stronger in AOTY, so anyone who really likes her will vote for her in there.
If they go with the bigger hit, Flowers wins, if they take the safest route, they’ll go with WWIMF, Jon’s songs or Not Strong Enough.
. Even Kill Bill seems more likely because at least it’s SZA’s biggest hit, while Anti-Hero will never be as big as Blank Space or Shake It Off(and both lost). I just don’t see a narrative or momentum for it to win and I doubt “She never won SOTY/ROTY” is good enough, not for someone who has 3 AOTY wins to “compensate” for that.
 Now this is misleading when Anti-Hero was caught between years. 
Anti-Hero wasn’t bigger than DSN and you all know it.
I’m listening to folklore tonight. Wow what a magnificent beautifully crafted piece of art. I’m just here sitting in tears, this is pretty much Swift’s magnum opus. It’ll be very hard for her to top it. I’m ok with her not winning AOTY for Midnights. I know she’ll have an even better album worthy of a fourth win in the future. Let’s let Sza, Boy Genius or Lana take this! I feel like she herself would be so happy for either of them taking it.
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
