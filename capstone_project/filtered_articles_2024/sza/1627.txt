Doja Cat has blamed hackers after she seemingly dissed Iggy Azalea on social media.
In a stil-not-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday (July 8), Doja’s account fired off a post that read: “fuck that stupid bitch @IGGYAZALEA and buy $DOJA.”

The Scarlet rapper later claimed to have been hacked, posting on Instagram: “My Twitter’s been hacked, these messages are not from me.”
The rapper’s profile picture on X also disappeared, with a community note later being added which said: “Doja Cat’s account has been hacked, so this tweet is not real.”

Before Doja Cat clarified that she had been hacked, Iggy Azalea had already guessed that’s what had gone down.
She wrote: “Get rugged if yall want but I’m cool w that girl irl so yall fucked up w that tweet hackers.”

Iggy added: “They hacked Doja cat n have posted a shitcoin scam. As far as I know there’s no intention for her to make a token. She’s just hacked, that’s all. Same as last week with Sydney.”
The “Fancy” rapper then hit out at the hackers: “Hackers on celeb girl accounts again making it about me cause I’m their fixation but they didn’t consider the fact that I may actually interact w ppl in real life and it’s not fitting into reality lol.”

Coincidentally, Iggy Azalea recently hit out at cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, leading to fans to think she was dissing SZA.
“Who’s solana…? I don’t know that bitch,” Iggy wrote on X in May, seemingly unaware that Solana is SZA’s middle name.

The Australian rapper clarified: “Girl im talking about crypto. And I love sza too! not about to have Stan Twitter rope her into crypto shit hahaha lmaooo.”
Solana, as Iggy noted in a follow-up tweet, is a blockchain platform. It launched in 2020 and uses the SOL cryptocurrency.

Azalea previously announced her intention to step away from music.
“In truth what I’ve known for a long time is that I feel more passionately about design and creative direction than I do about song writing,” she said. “To many of you that’s no shock to read. It shows in my work. Haha! Jokes aside, i do spend a lot more time on that part of things… because Im most confident at that.

“That’s why I want to let you know that I’m not going to finish my album. It’s been paused for a few months while I was giving direction for a different project & in truth I just haven’t felt the urge to go back to it.”
She added: “I feel really happy & passionate in my day to day life when my minds focused on that and so I want to stick to what’s undeniably best for me.”
