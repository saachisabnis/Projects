What can’t SZA do?
During a recent interview on NBC Sports, the "Kill Bill" singer met up with Simone Biles ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris and revealed that she used to be a gymnast before she transitioned into doing to music.
“I was nowhere near as cool as you,” SZA said to the Olympic champion. “When it was clear to me that I wasn’t gonna be a national gymnast, I was like 'Okay, let me see what I can do.'”
SZA admitted that she considered singing her “hidden talent” at one point but made the decision to transition because she realized she “wasn't going to be a national gymnast.” She also made sure to give Biles her flowers. “It’s [been] my dream to talk to you.” SZA told the 27-year-old, “You’re like my wildest dream. I have never seen anything like you. No one has.”
The pair then took part in a handstand competition. “She’s going to knock me over,” Biles joked before the New Jersey native claimed her victory.  
On Sunday (June 30), SZA won the award for Best Female R&B/Pop Artist at the BET Awards 2024.
