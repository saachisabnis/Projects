SZA took the stage at Glastonbury Festival 2024 held on Sunday in Glastonbury, Eng. The R&B artist shared the stage with the likes of Avril Lavigne, Janelle Monae and Burna Boy. 
The “Good Days” singer wore two total looks for her set, including two new pairs of shoes. SZA’s first pair sat just below her knees and consisted of neutral tan uppers accompanied by zip-up closures and pointed toes, likely finished off with block heels. 
Paired with her neutral booties, the “Kill Bill” singer wore a matching corseted tan bodysuit fixed with beading and reptilian fabric in a sort of tribal style with the knee high boots. The bodysuit was layered overtop black fishnet tights. Accompanied by her more colorful footwear choice, the performer wore another bodysuit in a long-sleeve style featuring a futuristic robotic print that matched the subversive vibe of her boots.

The second pair of shoes SZA changed into were much more eye-catching. The thigh-high style was crafted of a brown quilted fabric with neon orange accents and black string strung throughout for a utilitarian look. The toes of the boots were also quilted, made of a contrasting white fabric. 
When it comes to shoes, SZA’s style is often relaxed and casual. The musician often wears lace-up boots and sneakers for casual appearances and while performing, hailing from brands including Keds and Vans. For more formal occasions, she’s also been seen in various platform and lace-up heeled sandals over the years, as well.
