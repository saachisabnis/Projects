In a new interview with British Vogue, SZA disclosed that not only is she working on her long-rumored new album, Lana, but the Grammy-winning R&B star has another project on the way as well. SZA is going to release a deluxe-version of her 2022 Billboard No. 1 album, SOS, with a finished version of Lana also in the works. SZA is clearly staying busy making music, even if she is making her fans wait patiently for it. And that music is having a healing effect on the award-winning musician, putting SZA in a better place emotionally. “I think I am making music from a more beautiful place. From a more possible place versus a more angsty place,” SZA shared. “I’m not identifying with my brokenness. It’s not my identity. It’s sh*t that happened to me. Yeah, I experienced cruelty. I have to put it down at some point. Piece by piece, my music is shifting because of that, the lighter I get.” (Billboard)
