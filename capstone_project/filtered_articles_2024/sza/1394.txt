Recently, SZA dropped her own version of “Lose Yourself,” which triggered a reaction from Eminem.
SZA said about her new cover, “U ever just cover Eminem on some tender s**t for feels?  (Not on a project Just for mental health [yoga emoji]).”
Em reacted to the cover by posting a shocked-face emoji, which fans reacted to in the comment section of SZA’s post.
What do you think of Eminem’s new song?
