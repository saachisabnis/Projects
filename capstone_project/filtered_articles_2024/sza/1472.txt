SZA will be remaking Lana – the deluxe edition of her SOS album – from scratch after fans have leaked a number of songs slated for the project.
In since-deleted Tweets from Monday (March 25), the “Snooze” singer expressed frustration at the songs hitting the web.

She wrote: “So, we’ll make this really simple. Y’all leaked three songs from the deluxe. At this point, y’all can keep the throwaways and leaks. I’ll be starting ‘Lana’ from scratch. Do not ask me about it again. Thank you.”
In a second Tweet, she added: “I’ll round up the leaks y’all already got and u can have those. Seems like a fair deal. ENJOY.”
Earlier this month, the TDE singer ramped up excitement for the deluxe version of SOS after releasing a racy teaser video.
With a caption that said: “Never fight over community D,” the TDE singer posted a video on Instagram, which included a snippet of a new song.

The accompanying visuals showed her frolicking around a room in a tent while wearing nothing but a red bikini.
The lyrics were equally as racy as SZA sings: “Peel it back, lemme see inside/ Lick the pussy when we feelin’ sumn/ Shit feels so different when it’s prime time/ When it’s up front, they reportin’ live.”

SZA has been teasing an expansion of her blockbuster sophomore album for a while.
Late last year, she posted a number of potential covers for the deluxe version, titled Lana, and suggested the project would drop before Christmas but it never did.

She also spoke about the release with Billboard, saying: “After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done. I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself and not just smiling and nodding at accolades but really feeling it internally and knowing that I’m good enough.”
She added: “I guess I need to stop trying to figure out what it means and start realizing and living in what it is.”

SZA also released a new song near the end of February, which had fans thinking the deluxe was imminent.
She released five versions of the song “Saturn,” which had earlier been previewed at the 2024 Grammy Awards.

SZA had also previously promised that the deluxe would be out in the fall, but that also failed to come to fruition.
