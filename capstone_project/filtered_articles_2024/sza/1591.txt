In her cover story for Vogue UK, SZA opened up about the procedure, which she first alluded to in her 2022 chart-topping album, SOS.
While she admitted to having mixed feelings about her decision, she’s not dwelling on regret. “I’m so mad I did that,” she said. “During recovery, I was stuck being inactive, trying to maintain the results, which made me gain a lot of weight. It felt so pointless.”

SZA’s honesty about her experience mirrors the recent trend of celebrities speaking openly about their cosmetic procedures. Latto, known for hits like “Brokey,” also addressed her own experience with a BBL, encouraging her younger fans to consider natural methods like exercise over surgery.
Despite her reservations, SZA maintains a positive outlook. On SOS, she openly sang about her body journey, intertwining vulnerability and confidence. This approach to self-love is what makes SZA’s music resonate deeply with her fans.
She still embraces body positivity, noting, “But I love my butt. Don’t get me wrong. It looks good. I’m grateful it has a somewhat natural appearance. But at this point, I don’t really care. It’s something I wanted, and I’m enjoying it. I love moving it.”

Kendrick Lamar, who collaborated with SZA on “All the Stars” from Black Panther: The Album, has also shown unwavering support for her.
In the interview, he highlighted her courage, saying,
“Her openness in her music is courageous and powerful. She’s a testament to what it means to be human—a mix of emotions, and that’s perfectly fine. It shows we’re truly alive.”
SZA’s story serves as a reminder that while body enhancement procedures have become mainstream, they come with their own challenges and lessons. Her candid reflections inspire a broader conversation about self-acceptance and the realities behind cosmetic choices.
