Behind the boards, production comes from the likes of Benny Blanco, J. White Did It, Carter Lang and more.
Lana — the title of which nods to SZA’s real name Solána — was slightly delayed from its scheduled midnight release, with the deluxe album not hitting streaming services until later Friday morning.
SZA explained the hold-up on Thursday night (December 19), writing on Instagram: “Had to get my mixes right lol! All songs are delivered and ingesting into the system as we speak. pls be kind .. we been up for days.”
Lana music videos have also begun being rolled out, with Ben Stiller starring in the visual for “Drive.”

The clip finds the Hollywood actor lip-syncing to the tender, tortured ballad on a late-night cruise, as well as leaning out of his car window à la Health Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight, pulling donuts and dancing in the middle of the road.
It ends with a dreamy scene featuring a butt-naked SZA wearing the same prosthetic bug mask that she dons on the Lana album cover.
Lana had been a long time in the making, with SZA first teasing an expanded edition of SOS back in February 2023.
The TDE singer said in an interview with Billboard at the time that the project would feature 10 new songs and be released “soon.”

“After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done,” she added. “I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself and not just smiling and nodding at accolades but really feeling it internally and knowing that I’m good enough.
“I guess I need to stop trying to figure out what it means and start realizing and living in what it is.”
