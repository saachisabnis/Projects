SZA's eerie new look for her first official "Hot Ones" episode has fans buzzing about a possible Lana nod.  
The "Kill Bill" songstress appeared on a First We Feast promotional poster for an upcoming episode of the popular series on Tuesday (September 24), depicting an attempt to conquer a gauntlet of extremely fiery hot wings. 
In the clip, SZA appears to be wearing an alien costume, featuring large, black eyes and long antennae reaching far above her wavy locks. The look, typically unusual for a "Hot Ones" guest, could be much bigger than the episode itself. 
Fans immediately took to the comment section of the post, speculating that the interesting look might be a nod to the artists's highly-anticipated third studio album, Lana, or a possible "Saturn" music video. 
"Yasssss she’s def promoting the Saturn videoooo," wrote one fan. Others questioned if SZA was even behind the mask observing, "Are we sure that's sza?"
The "Snooze" standout herself even commented on the post, referring to the event as "Fun times at the pain farm ❤️".
According to Uproxx, SZA previously threatened to cancel the release of her forthcoming record altogether after experiencing "premature leaks," but later decided to include the leaks in an SOS Deluxe release and continue working on Lana.
