Virgin Radio drivetime host and Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson has given his two-cents on the recently-announced Glastonbury 2024 line-up. 
On Thursday (14th March) it was revealed that Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA will headline at Worthy Farm, while country star Shania Twain will play the Sunday afternoon legend slot.
It will be the fifth time that Coldplay will headline the festival, having previously topped the bill in 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2016. R&B singer SZA is set to play Glasto for the first time, and what a way to start, by headlining the Pyramid stage!
Elsewhere in the line-up are acts such as Jessie Ware, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Heaton, Keane, Paloma Faith, Idles, Little Simz, Disclosure, The National, LCD Soundsystem, PJ Harvey, James Blake and Avril Lavigne.
During his Virgin Radio show yesterday afternoon, Ricky, who has appeared with Kaiser Chiefs on Glastonbury line-ups in 2005, 2014 and 2017, shared his initial thoughts, and immediately suggested that the “line-up was a line-down.”
“No I’m joking of course,” he quickly retorted, before unveiling the “truth” that people don’t realise about putting together such an impressive billing. 
He shared: “The truth is, what they know is, when everyone gets there, they're going to be happy. Okay, that's all you have to worry about. You'll have a great time.
“I went last year, I didn't even watch Guns 'N' Roses and I love Guns 'N'Roses. I didn't even see them! I was busy in another field somewhere. I stayed there for three days and had the best three days of my life.”
On those who were left unimpressed with 2024’s offering, Ricky continued: “It's a generational shift. If you're worried about the fact it's not your favourite artist, are you going? That's it, you have to ask yourself. Don't worry about it.”
Festival organiser Emily Eavis had previously teased that this year’s festival will have two female headliners, and that has indeed proved to be the case. Last year's festival had an all-male headline line-up, with Arctic Monkeys, Guns 'N' Roses and Elton John topping the bill.
Shania Twain took to social media to express her excitement about playing the festival, by posting a video and writing: "The legends slot at GLASTONBURY 2024 - Another jewel in my crown!! 👑 I feel so honoured and so excited about this one! Thinking about what to wear already 💅 and tell me, what should we sing together?! Let’s make history with this ultimate dream performance!!"
Glastonbury Festival 2024 will take place at Worthy Farm in Somerset from 26th to 30th June 2024.
Keep listening to Ricky Wilson on his weekday Drivetime show between 4pm-7pm on Virgin Radio UK on DAB, online, Sky TV, smart speakers or via the 'Virgin Radio UK' app.
