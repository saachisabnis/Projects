French Montana, Keke Palmer and even Backstreet Boys singer AJ McLean were in the building to celebrate SZA‘s multiple Grammy wins at the SOS-themed after-party her label threw for her.
At the 2024 Grammy Awards on Sunday (February 5), the New Jersey songstress won three of her nine nominations: Best R&B Song for “Snooze,” Best Progressive R&B Album for SOS and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Ghost In The Machine” with Phoebe Bridgers.

Taking to her Instagram Story to react to her wins, SZA wrote: “So grateful for my family, friends and entire team. There’s NO way I could’ve done anything w out their PATIENCE and understanding [teary-eyed and handshake emojis]”
Her label, Top Dawg Entertainment, put together a celebration at Los Angeles hotspot Caviar Kaspia after the ceremony. The Pávē Group designed the room based on the aquatic theme of her SOS album cover with a diving board, boat and lighthouse. The setup also featured a nod to her debut album, CTRL, with different shades of green, moss and plant life.
Other big names in the building included SiR, Bia, Chris Brown, Wale and many more. Kevin Hart, who wasn’t present at the gathering, also supported the event in a major way as his Gran Coramino tequila was the official drink of the night.
Prior to the show, SZA’s TDE labelmate ScHoolboy Q made sure to publicly declare his support for the SOS chanteuse, while also announcing his upcoming release in March.
