SZA claps back at the negative comments made about her body. 
The “Snooze” singer went on X to address the person who commented on her body. The comment came after a 2020 video resurfaced of her as part of H&M’s Join the Recycling Revolution campaign. The video shows SZA in her mother’s house going through a box of old clothes, picking out a skirt that she was going to recycle. 
As the video went viral, she wrote, “Covid was hard… my granny had just died… I was hella depressed n masking. Not eating. Overworking out. But I always had my childhood home to n get lost. Still do. Grateful to be in a much better mental space now. s/o to those days tho.”
Although the message was uplifting, one X user said that she missed that era of SZA as well and proceeded to say, “before she got big and bbl culture like.” SZA was not happy about the comment and responded with, “Y’all say weird s**t like this and wonder why I’m different and don’t feel comfortable w/ y’all anymore. Lol.” 
The singer has been open about the insecurities she deals with when it comes to her body and her BBL in the past.
