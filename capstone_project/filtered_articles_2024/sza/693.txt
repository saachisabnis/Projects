	Doja Cat is not one to shy away from Y2K style and if you’ve gotten tickets to the Scarlet tour you can see everything from her oversized fur boots to long blonde hair (reminiscent of early 2000s Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera) embodying the decade. On and off the stage though, the “Agora Hills” rapper has repeatedly been wearing bold Y2K-inspired rings from the woman and AAPI-owned business BonBonWhims — and the rapper’s most-worn ring is close to selling out.
