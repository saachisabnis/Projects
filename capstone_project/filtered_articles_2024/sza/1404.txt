SZA may be one of the best singers on the planet, but her response to a fan asking for homework help has revealed she is no mathematician.
The TDE R&B star took to Instagram Stories on Wednesday (August 28) to share a hilarious interaction she had with someone who needed some assistance with geometry homework.
The fan slid into SZA’s DMs and wrote: “SZA I’m failing geometry can you give me math tips[?]”
SZA sent a few replies. She wrote: “Lmaooo ma’am I’m a math dummy[.] I’m not sure what you expected [crying laughing emoji][.] Tell me about the shapes chile[.] How can I help[?]”

The “Snooze” singer captioned her story: “I appreciate the faith in me [holding back tears emoji].”

Though SZA was happy to help, she’s looking for another sort of person to hop in her DMs.

Earlier this month, she revealed that she’s passionately looking to be consumed by love – to the point where it overwhelms her thoughts, breath and existence.
Taking to X, the superstar singer declared that she wants love so bad, she wants to be “choked” in it.
“I wanna be loved so madly I can’t think I can’t breathe I can’t BE,” she wrote. “I WANNA BE TRAPPED IN THE EVER DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF HYSTERIA THAT IS LOVE I WANNA DROWN AND SUFFOCATE IN ITTTT AAAAHHHHHHHHH CHOKE ME IN LOVE PLEASE !!!”
Just last month, SZA admitted she can pull guys – but she can’t keep them interested…and she knows why.

On an episode of Chicken Shop Date, host Amelia Dimoldenberg shared that she has had a difficult time getting second dates; a sentiment SZA echoed.
“I feel like I can catch ’em, but I cannot keep ’em,” she replied. “They get with me and they realize I’m fucking weird, and then it’s just like, ‘Aight.’
“The butt makes it seem like it’s normal. On the outside, like, I wanna shake ass an do all the normal things. But I also wanna just, like… I wanna swim in the swamp and I wanna, like, collect methane gas with my man. That’s my type of shit.”
