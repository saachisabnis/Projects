SZA is a woman of many talents. The TDE singer recently linked up with Gynamist, Simone Biles for some lessons in tumbling. In the past, SZA has been open about her involvement in the sport during her youth. So it’s no surprise when the “Snooze” singer got a chance to link up with Biles, she jumped at the chance. The two even had a handstand contest, to which Biles was undoubtedly the winner. Ever the good sport, Biles offered SZA just the encouragement she needed to perfect her handstand. 
“This is my dream to talk to you. I’m not even kidding,” the singer gushed. SZA calls Biles her “wildest dream,” and says that “I just have never seen anything like you.” She added, “No one has, but it’s just like, wow.” Biles is the most decorated gymnast in the sport’s history with a total of 37 Olympic and World Championship medals.

All of them true. Here’s some for u.”
