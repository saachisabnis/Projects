Taking to her socials, SZA has shared a preview teaser of SOS deluxe.
SZA released her second studio album, SOS, in December 2022. The album featured hit tracks such as "Kill Bill", "Gone Girl", and "F2F", and won Album of the Year at the 2023 BET Awards. At the tail end of last year, she revealed that the deluxe edition of the album will be called Lana.
In the album teaser, a sample of Isley Brothers' "Voyage To Atlantis" can be heard amongst an unreleased track of SZA's. She has captioned the post: "Clock starts now . Happy anniversary", in reference to the release of the original album, SOS.
