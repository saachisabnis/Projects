Grammy-winning artist SZA, also known as Solána Imani Rowe, has opened up about her decision to undergo a Brazilian butt lift (BBL) — and she’s not holding back on her regrets. In a recent interview with British Vogue, the 35-year-old singer expressed frustration over what she now considers a “stupid” choice. “I’m so mad I did that,” she confessed. “I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat. It was just so stupid.”
The BBL, a popular cosmetic procedure, involves transferring fat from other parts of the body to enhance the size and shape of the buttocks. For SZA, the recovery process proved more challenging than anticipated, leading to weight gain and weeks of restricted movement. Reflecting on the decision, she added, “Who gives a f**? You got a BBL, you realize you didn’t need the sht. It doesn’t matter.”
Though SZA has regrets, she also acknowledged she is happy with the results. “I love my butt. Don’t get me wrong. My booty looks nice. And I’m grateful that it looks pretty much… I don’t know, sometimes natural,” she explained. However, the singer remains conflicted, noting that while the results may look good, they came at a price she wasn’t fully prepared to pay.
SZA went on to reflect on other aspects of self-improvement, emphasizing that her mental health should have been her priority over cosmetic changes. “This body is temporary,” she said, adding, “I have other sht I need to work on about myself… I need to get my f**ing mental health together.”
As one of today’s leading voices in R&B, SZA also spoke on the toll that fame takes on her mental health. Known for her honest discussions about anxiety, she revealed that even the high points of her career come with challenges. “Every day I grapple with, ‘Am I done with music?’” she admitted. Although she sometimes feels she’s not “meant to be famous,” SZA continues to push forward.
