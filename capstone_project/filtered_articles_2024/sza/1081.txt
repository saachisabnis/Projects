Lizzo did not take home any hardware during Sunday‚Äôs (Jan. 7) second night of the 2023 Primetime Emmy Creative Arts Awards. But in a classic ‚Äújust happy to be nominated‚Äù post the ‚ÄúAbout Damn Time‚Äù singer said that she was still tipping up in celebration of the honor. 

	‚ÄúNAH IMA TALK MY S‚ÄìT‚Ä¶ OUT OF 100s OF CONCERT SPECIALS THE EMMYS CHOSE MINE FOR OUTSTANDING VARIETY SPECIAL‚Äî ITS AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED TONIGHT WITH LEGENDS!‚Äù Lizzo wrote in an Instagram post about her 2023 HBO Max special Lizzo: Live in Concert getting a nod in the category for pre-recorded variety specials.

	










	Lizzo thanked her ‚Äútour family‚Äù and the specials guests who appeared in the special directed by Sam Wrench (Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour) that premiered on Dec. 31, including Missy Elliott, Cardi B and SZA. ‚ÄúWE HAD A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE THAT *NO ONE* CAN TAKE AWAY FROM US,‚Äù she wrote, giving props to the A-list help for making the show ‚ÄúEVEN EXTRA SPECIAL.‚Äù The post also included shots from the concert of Lizzo performing, as well as hugging Elliott, Cardi and SZA.

Live in Concert was bested by the NBC special Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love in the category that also included stand-up specials from Trevor Noah, Wanda Sykes and John Mulaney and a tribute to TV icon Norman Lear. 

	‚ÄúIM DOIN SHOTS TONIGHT CUS WE ARE ALREADY WINNERS AND MORE THAN CONQUERERSüôåüèæ IM TAGGING EVERYBODY IN THE PICS ‚Äî I LOVE YOU, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,‚Äù Lizzo added.

	The awards were originally slated to take place in September, but were postponed because of the Hollywood writers and actors strikes.
