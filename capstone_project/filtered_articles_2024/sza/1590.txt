Home    Forums    Music    R&B Field Predictions: Grammys 2024 (Part 2)
Definitely should show R&B Performance & R&B Album.
Pretty confident we can get a SZA & Victoria Monét televised win unless we have a Call My Name moment in R&B Performance.
If an R&B category is televised, which category do you think would be televised? 
I’d say R&B Performance.
Progressive R&B album or R&B Song. 
If they televise Progressive R&B album that would be a really bad sign for SZA in AOTY
They won’t. Diddy is nominated, and I’m sure they don’t want any attention on his name.

If SOS doesn’t win Album of the Year, I can see them doing it. They’ll give SZA the Beyoncé treatment. Have her give a speech for the album. 
Honey, televising Best Progressive R&B Album will NOT be a really bad sign for SZA.  It has been done before.
SZA and Victoria are going to sweep.
I can only pray that Coco Jones has a fighting chance in Best New Artist
Honey, televising Best Progressive R&B Album will NOT be a really bad sign for SZA.  It has been done before.
Why u think that cause I still feel it’s a bad sign if they televised this progressive R&B.
Honey, Grammys have televised artists winning their genre album category and Album of the Year plenty of times.  Just last year, Harry Styles’ Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year wins were televised.  Taylor Swift’s Best Country Album and Album of the Year wins were televised.  Kacey Musgraves’ Best Country Album and Album of the Year wins were televised.  The Chicks’ Best Country Album (2007) and Album of the Year wins were televised.  OutKast’s Best Rap Album (2004) and Album of the Year wins were also televised.
Probably not relevant to her chances but I found it shocking that SZA didn’t get not one nomination at the NAACP Awards this year while Victoria, Coco and Janelle all got nominations. It’s very alarming considering the big year in music she has had. Keke Palmer got nominated for Entertainer of the Year yet SZA gets nothing? 
The NAACP is a weird organization… them snubbing her reminds me of how they used to snub Rihanna back in the day. But, if Victoria beats SZA in categories like R&B Song and Performance, i guess I won’t be shocked. There’s passion for her. 
Victoria is not winning R&B Performance over SZA. Her biggest threats are Robert Glasper (we know he shows up when we least expect it) OR “ICU” (totally a Grammy-sounding song). “Kill Bill” will win based on its sheer popularity and love across the board. Rooting for “On My Mama” for R&B Song, but “Snooze” was the biggest R&B song of last year and is still reigning. It’s going to win. The NAACP Awards are known for going with underdogs in the nominations phase. SZA has already swept the Soul Train and BET Awards. Those have more crossover with Grammy voters.
Final Predictions. 
BEST R&B ALBUM
JAGUAR II — Victoria Monét
BEST R&B PERFORMANCE
KILL BILL – SZA
BEST TRAD R&B PERF
Love Language — SZA
BEST PROG R&B ALBUM
SOS – SZA
BEST R&B SONG
SNOOZE — Solana Rowe, Khris Riddick-Tynes, Blair Ferguson, Kenneth Edmonds & Leon Thomas (SZA)
Let the SZA Fever begin 🙂
Part of me is feeling an “ICU” upset.
‘ICU’ has such ‘hrs and hrs’ energy to me. but i keep remdinding myself that muni long had a bigger hit than coco does, and she beat a category of non-hits, whereas coco faces the 3rd biggest song of rhe year
