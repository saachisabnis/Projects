Drake has reportedly signed 4Batz to his OVO Sound imprint for an EP soon after the up-and-comer released an official remix of “act ii: date @ 8” featuring the Toronto rhymer.
According to Billboard, the deal was a short-term license. It was confirmed by two execs and follows a bidding war for 4Batz, whose hit “act ii: date @ 8” is making major waves.

The track not only racked up 35 million streams for the rising rapper, but also landed him on the Billboard Hot 100, ultimately climbing to No. 59.
The warm reception caught the 6 God’s attention, leading to an official remix. Batz’s lawyer declined to comment on news his client is headed to the OVO imprint but mentioned that he “made a calculated decision to creatively collaborate with one of the most iconic artists ever.”

The attorney added added: “The positive energy and overall support from Team Drake/OVO was a driving factor in getting this song released. We are grateful for their involvement and are excited to see what the future holds as a result of this epic creative and business move.”
On Friday (March 8), the Dallas-bred singer released a new version of his viral hit, with Drizzy delivering a slow-crawling, half-sung guest verse over the chopped-and-screwed part of the song.

On the track, which was released through OVO Sound and 4Batz’s own label, Drake references the game show Jeopardy! and compares himself to Dave Chappelle, while rapping about an intoxicating fling.
“I really gotta calm down/ ‘Fore I end up in jeopardy just like the game show/ Broski my twin, that’s my bestie/ He love me, said I got the blessin’/ I swear he’s gassin’ me up/ There’s no way in hell I see you passing me up,” he raps.

He later says: “A thousand on your fuckin’ hair/ Two hunnid on your fuckin’ nails, for real/ This shit feel like a fairy tale/ I’ll make them open up Chanel/ I’m a stand-up guy like Dave Chappelle/ I was cursed, you ’bout to break the spell, for real.”
Despite the hype for the collaboration, many fans were underwhelmed with the outcome.
