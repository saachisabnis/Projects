The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter joins the likes of Kylie, Robbie Williams and Stevie Nicks at BST this summer
Getting ready to lose â€˜Ctrlâ€™. Pop superstar SZA has joined the sparkling roster of headlinersÂ atÂ BST in Hyde Park in London this summer, claiming top spot on the bill of the first Saturday of the festival.Â 
The R&B star and songwriter rose to fame thanks to collaborations with icons like Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar and Nicki Minaj, as well as the critical success of â€˜Ctrlâ€™, her first studio album. SZAâ€™s second albumÂ â€˜SOSâ€™ spent a staggering 41 weeks at the top of Billboardâ€™s top R&B albums chart, produced four top ten singles, and she was the most nominated artist at the Grammys this year, winning in three categories. Pretty astounding, right?
We can expect to hear some of her top tracks like â€˜The Weekendâ€™, â€˜Kill Billâ€™, and â€˜Broken Clocksâ€™. Excited? Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about what is sure to be one of the most sensational shows of the summer.Â 
RECOMMENDED: Kylie Minogue is (also) headlining BST festival this summer.Â 
SZA will be headlining BST on Saturday June 29, supported by Sampha and Snoh Aalegra.Â 
Everyone set your reminders â€“ general sale for SZAâ€™s show goes live atÂ 9am on Friday March 8. You can purchase tickets on the BST website here.Â 
Presale tickets for SZAâ€™s show went live yesterday (March 6) at 10am, so if you were hoping to get in on the action, youâ€™re likely too late.Â 
It depends on the kind of admission you want, but general tickets for the festival start from between Â£90 and Â£111. There are different tiers for ticket prices: once one level has sold out, the price increases.Â 
There are also VIP and accessible packages on offer, with Golden Circle tickets starting from Â£175.Â 
SZA herself hasnâ€™t commented on the show. However, BST described her as a â€˜phenomenal, groundbreaking, genre-bending artistâ€™.
BST knocks it out of the park every year, and 2024â€™s programme is no exception. Kings of Leon (June 30), Robbie Williams (July 6),Â Shania Twain (July 7), Stevie Nicks (July 12), and Kylie Minogue (July 13) are just some of the other iconic names set to headline thisÂ yearâ€™s edition.Â 
These are the festivals you need to be attending this summer.
