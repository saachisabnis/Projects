SZA has opened up about reversing one of her cosmetic surgeries — surgery that was originally done against the advice of her doctors.
During an appearance on the SHE MD podcast that aired on Monday (March 11), the TDE superstar revealed that she chose to get breast implants even though medical professionals advised her not to.

“I was supposed to see you before I got my breast surgery, but I didn’t,” she told OBGYN and host Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi. “I like snuck and got it anyway. I was not supposed to, with my risk of breast cancer […] I have metal markers in my breasts for all these fibrosis, for these lumps or whatever.
“I put ’em in, they ended up hurting me. I got way too much scar tissue because my breasts are too dense and I’m not supposed to have breast implants, and I ended up getting extra fibrosis, like with tissue or whatever, and I didn’t feel good and it was painful, so I took ’em out and now they’re just my boobs.”

SZA has never concealed that fact that she got a Brazilian Butt Lift, and she opened up about what led to that decision last year. During an interview with Elle published in May 2023, the Jersey-bred singer confirmed that she had her body altered to look better in clothes.
“I always wanted a really fat ass with less gym time,” she said. “I didn’t succumb to industry pressure, I succumbed to my own eyes in the mirror and being like, ‘No, I need some more ass.’”

She even joked that she treats her new body like an accessory that just adds flavor to whatever she’s wearing.
“I hate trying on clothes,” the 34-year-old added. “I don’t shop anywhere, I just wear whatever is free in my mail. I’m like, ‘Is it an extra large? Great.’ If I can feel like I’m under a blanket when I’m outside, that’s ideal.

I treat my butt like a purse. It’s just there to enhance whatever else. And that’s why I paid for it, because it works all by itself.”
As for her choice to reference the BBL in her music, SZA shared: “That’s some Jersey shit. You know what I’m saying? When I feel like I have too much to say and I don’t want to say it cute.”
