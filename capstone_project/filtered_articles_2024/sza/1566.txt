if the whole Drake feud ends by then, he should get him to be a part of this. 
It won’t. Kendrick has no reason to reverse his stance. And Drake learned after Kanye, that even public truces don’t last long in hip-hop
For your 2026 Grammy consideration

Young Money is crashing out right now because of this, Nicki Minaj is having another cokerant dissing Jay-Z. Birdman is also having a rant. Kendrick is really the boogeyman.

Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.

The fact that the “Control” verse from 11 years ago led to all of this is craziness. 
A solo Lil Wayne Half Time show would be a disaster. He’s no longer in his prime as a performer. He’d need Drake/Nicki/Birdman/Young Money to co-headline.

That verse changed everything but also Like That verse.

Yeah, he didn’t age well. Epilepsy, leans, forgetting lyrics of the songs. Kendrick can bring him as a guest and he can perform Lollipop and A Milli but headlining is not a wise choice.

There will be a lot of guest stars!!! 
And this will be a bathroom break for many! 
I wish they would stop disrespecting Pink. She should’ve been tapped to headline or co-headline (with Christina Aguilera).

The full irony of this post in 2024.
I’d love if SZA shows up to sing All the Stars, maybe giving her time to sing one of her solo songs as well.

Out of all the performers of the 2021 Halftime Show, Kendrick absolutely deserved to have his own halftime show. I’m from South America and I’m a huge fan of him.
It’s a shame that he already perform Alright, but he still has a handful of hits to go with. I think that show is gonna be powerful, because his Grammy’s performances has been absolutely insane.
And He’s definitely going to close his performance with “Not Like Us”
Official trailer dropped. SZA special guest. There’s a marching band at the back tho, are we getting Tyler too? Yes pls 😭😭 🤞🏻
Kendrick on expecting storytelling from his superbowl set, hip-hop and battle rap as an art form and a sport, the making of Reincarnated and GNX, and seeing SZA’s growth.
Watched the interview, Kendrick might be the calmest person in the music industry. He got another interview with Timothee Chalamet.

Only Nas exudes more of a sense of calmness
