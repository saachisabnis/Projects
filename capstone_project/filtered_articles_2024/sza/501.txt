Diddy may have made an impact on hip-hop, but Method Man doesn’t think his indictment will affect the culture. When asked by TMZ if he agreed that Diddy’s arrest/charges would contribute to hip-hop’s demise, Method responded, “How? I don’t think that it has anything to do with hip-hop as far as the culture. What are we talking about here? [It] has nothing to do with hip-hop at all. I don’t see the correlation whatsoever.” He used R. Kelly as an example to prove his point, noting, “We’re talking about creative and music and stuff like that. There’s people still listening to R. Kelly’s s***. I don’t know, I can’t answer that. But I don’t think it has anything to do with hip-hop.”
