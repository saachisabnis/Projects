Chief Keef and Sexyy Red may have some new heat on deck for their fans, if a recent collection of photos is to be believed.
In undated pics that surfaced online on Thursday (March 21), the rappers can be seen at what appears to be a video shoot.

In one photo, the pair appear to be watching a playback on a giant screen; in another, the “Pound Town” rapper is getting her hair done at a dinner table.
Details about the potential new collaboration are scarce, however.
In December, the duo joined forces to make an even bigger deal out of Sexyy’s massive hit, “Bow Bow Bow (F My Baby Dad).”
The track was originally released as part of the extended edition of Hood Hottest Princess.

In addition to Sexyy Red’s catchy hook — “Fuck my baby dad, fuck my baby dad/ I’m a fine-ass bitch, I ain’t in the house sad” — the Chicago icon added his own flavor to the joint.
And last month, Drake became Sexyy Red’s “Rich Baby Daddy” as they enjoyed a suburban life alongside their homie SZA in the creative visual to the popular track.

The video was shot mainly through the lens of an old school camcorder held by daddy-to-be Drake, documenting a New Year’s Eve party with his girl Red as well as SZA and another friend before Red goes into labor.
The group then takes it to the hospital where they’re later joined by scantily-clad women who twerk as the new parents celebrate the birth of their baby.

The video closes with a shout-out to Sexyy Red’s real-life recent birth of her second child.
“Bae you know Chief  So’ your daddy, come and grill your bitch ass/ I told bae, “You leave me, I’m puttin’ a round in your ass,” he raps.

Elsewhere in the interview, the “Love Sosa” rapper reflected on why he works so well with the “SkeeYee” rapper.
He explained: “Shit. I just know she fuck with me real heavy. I fuck with her too. Saying she wants to come through and I said “hell fucking yeah.”
