SZA wished she thought twice about undergoing a major cosmetic surgery procedure.
The singer (real name Solána Imani Rowe) admitted she regretted getting a BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift) in an interview with British Vogue which was published on Thursday, November 14.
“I’m so mad I did that s—,” SZA, 35, told the outlet. “I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat. It was just so stupid.”
However, the “Jocelyn Flowers” singer is choosing to view the surgery — which aims to enhance the size of a person’s backside by transferring fat from other areas — as a learning experience.
“But who gives a f—?” she added. “You got a BBL, you realize you didn’t need the s—. It doesn’t matter. I’ll do a whole bunch more s— just like it if I want to before I’m f—ing dead because this body is temporary. It just wasn’t super necessary.”
SZA revealed in 2023 she had gotten a BBL during an interview with ELLE magazine.
“I treat my butt like a purse. It’s just there to enhance whatever else,” she explained. “And that’s why I paid for it, because it works all by itself. I always wanted a really fat ass with less gym time. I didn’t succumb to industry pressure. I succumbed to my own eyes in the mirror and being like, ‘No, I need some more ass.’”
It’s not the first time SZA has been candid about her cosmetic surgeries. She previously opened about her issues with her breast implants on the “SHE MD” podcast in March, 2024.
SZA revealed she had a history of breast cancer in her family as her mother had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer while her aunt had undergone a mastectomy – making SZA high risk for breast cancer.

“With my risk of breast cancer and then with the actual — I have markers in my breast, metal markers in my breast for the fibrosis for these lumps or whatever, I’m not supposed to be getting breast implants,” she revealed.
While SZA was supposed to see a doctor before making a final decision on whether to get implants, she admitted on the podcast that she “snuck away” and “got it anyways.”
“So basically, I put them in. They ended up hurting me,” she divulged. “I got way too much scar tissue because my breasts are too dense, and I’m not supposed to have breast implants. And so I ended up getting extra fibrosis … I didn’t feel good and it was painful. So, I took them out, and now, they’re just my boobs.”
