SZA, the powerhouse behind hits like “Kill Bill,” is hitting the pause button on her performing schedule. The 34-year-old Grammy winner announced the news on Monday (August 5) following the conclusion of her final tour stop in Montreal just the night before.
In a candid message to her fans on social media, SZA wrote, “Yesterday was my last show for a while. Finally bout to get my life together thank u God.” It’s clear that after a whirlwind of performances and an intense tour schedule, SZA is ready to take some well-deserved time off to focus on herself.
This announcement comes on the heels of a series of performances that took her across the globe. SZA recently wrapped up shows in London and Dublin before electrifying the crowd at Lollapalooza 2024 in Chicago at the start of August. Her performance at Lollapalooza was particularly noteworthy, as it solidified her status as one of the most compelling live acts today.
Despite the break, SZA’s fans won’t be completely deprived of her presence. She still has two shows scheduled in the Middle East later this year, with stops planned in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in November. However, it’s evident that these will be her last appearances on stage for some time as she steps away to recharge.
This isn’t the first time SZA has hinted at needing a break. Back on June 29, she took to social media to express her desire for some downtime, writing, “I need a beach n some rubs statt.” This candid admission gave fans a glimpse into the toll that her rigorous schedule has taken on her, both physically and mentally. SZA’s honesty about needing time for self-care resonates with many, as the pressures of the music industry often lead artists to push themselves to the limit.
While her decision to take a break might come as a surprise to some, it’s a move that many artists have found necessary to maintain their well-being and creativity. For SZA, who has been on a non-stop ride of success, from the release of her critically acclaimed album “SOS” to sold-out shows across the world, taking time off is crucial for her to return even stronger.
Fans of SZA can take solace in the fact that this break doesn’t signal an end but rather a necessary pause. In the meantime, there’s plenty to look forward to. Notably, SZA is set to star alongside Keke Palmer in an upcoming buddy comedy movie, created by the team behind the hit series “Rap Sh!t.” This new venture into acting is an exciting development for SZA, who continues to expand her artistic horizons beyond music.
