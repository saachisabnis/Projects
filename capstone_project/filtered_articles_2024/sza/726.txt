Kendrick Lamar is set to hit the road next year in support of his latest chart-topping album GNX, but some fans think there’s yet another dig at Drake buried in his plans.
The Compton rap star announced the Grand National Tour on Tuesday (December 3), a 19-city arena tour that takes Kendrick and co-headliner SZA across North America between April and June.

The date that’s generating the most chatter is not the one (or two) in K.Dot’s hometown of Los Angeles, but the one in the backyard of his fierce rival Drake, Toronto, which is the only stop outside of the U.S. on the entire tour.
The “Not Like Us” hitmaker will perform at the Rogers Centre on June 12, becoming the first rapper to headline the stadium (which was previously called the SkyDome).

Fans on social media had a field day at this news, with many interpreting it as a hidden shot at the 6 God — not least because of the fact that the Toronto concert falls shortly before Father’s Day.
“Kendrick and SZA performing ‘Not Like Us’ in Toronto the same week as Father’s Day gonna open a portal,” one person joked, while another commented: “This man has unlocked a new level of diabolical [crying face emojis].”

Someone else weighed in: “I don’t think yall realize how crazy it is that Kendrick is doing the Rogers Centre in Toronto for his tour. That’s the biggest venue in the city & Drake has NEVER done a show there. If he sells out the biggest venue in Toronto before the local rap megastar that’s crazy.”
The commotion was further fueled by the Toronto Blue Jays, who play their home games at the Rogers Centre, promoting Kendrick’s concert on social media.

“TORONTO Blue Jays out here promoting Kendrick’s tour lmaooo [skull emoji],” one user reacted, before turning Drake’s “Push Ups” boast that he “get[s] more love in the city than you from” back on him.
Others responded to the Blue Jays’ post by playfully comparing Kendrick’s performance to that of epic wrestling moments.

While Drake has yet to address Kendrick Lamar’s upcoming tour invading his home city, he has reacted to his aforementioned album GNX.
While tuning into Twitch star LosPollosTV’s livestream on Tuesday, the OVO Sound founder mocked Kendrick by putting his own spin on his viral “Mustaaard!” line from “TV Off.”

As LosPollosTV was complaining about how streaming services allegedly play Kendrick’s chart-topping single “Squabble Up” after Drake’s album Certified Lover Boy, the Toronto rapper jumped into the comments section and wrote: “we need a donut emoji in the chat,” before adding: “CUSTAAAARRRRRD.”
