SZA says she regrets the day she got a Brazilian butt lift, but she's made peace with her decision. On Thursday, November 14, Vogue UK debuted its latest cover story featuring the 35-year-old singer. Deep within the interview, SZA got candid about her recent BBL surgery and said she's "so mad" she did the procedure in 2022. “I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat," she explained. "It was just so stupid. But who gives a f**k? You got a BBL, you realize you didn’t need the s**t."
"It doesn’t matter," she continued. "I’ll do a whole bunch more s**t just like it if I want to before I’m f**king dead because this body is temporary. It just wasn’t super necessary – I have other s**t that I need to work on about myself… I need to get my f**king mental health together." SZA first revealed the news about her altered bum on the title track of her critically-acclaimed SOS album. She still feels remorseful about her decision to this day. However, she's come to terms with her new looks. She thinks the operation was a success and loves her body. "I love my butt," she added. "Don’t get me wrong. My booty look nice. And I’m grateful that it looks pretty much… I don’t know, sometimes natural, but I don’t even care. It’s something that I wanted. I’m enjoying it. I love shaking it.”In addition to the discussion about her surgery, SZA also confirmed plans for new music. She's currently planning to drop a deluxe version of SOS and her third studio album Lana. Both projects do not have a release date yet. Despite everything she's been through, SZA's ability to open up about her life decisions in her music continues to attract more fans. According to her good friend Kendrick Lamar, the singer is the epitome of what the human experience is supposed to look like. “Her vulnerability through her music is brave and inspiring,” Lamar said. “She’s a reminder of what the human experience looks like: a roller-coaster of emotions. And that’s OK. We are alive.”See more shots from her cover story here.
