Roman Kemp made a dig at the Christian Horner scandal which is currently dominating the headlines, during the BRIT Awards on Saturday night.
The Capital Radio host was part of the presenting team, alongside Maya Jama and Clara Amfo, for the star-studded ceremony at London's O2 which was broadcast on ITV.
Roman made a cheeky quip about Red Bull boss Christian during the live show, which took place just hours after Horner put on a united front at the Bahrain Grand Prix with his wife Geri Halliwell.
Whilst milling around the guests at the ceremony, Roman quipped: 'It's busier here than at team Red Bull's press office.'

It comes amid allegations relating to the leak of hundreds of WhatsApp messages which appeared to be written by Horner to a female colleague.
The messages came on Thursday, just 24 hours after Horner was cleared to continue as Red Bull head following an internal probe into 'inappropriate behaviour' by the F1 team's parent company, Red Bull GmbH.  
Horner, who has always denied the claims, said previously: 'I have the support of an incredible family, an incredible wife, an incredible team and everybody within that team.
'And my focus is going on racing, winning racing and doing the best I can. It was a day about starting the season in he best possible way. My focus is on this team, my family, my wife and racing.'
Viewers were left less than impressed by another Roman quip on Saturday night.
The presenter called Green Day 'the America Busted' igniting the fury of fans of the hugely successful US band.
Tré Cool and Billie Joe Armstrong of the American pop punk band attended the award ceremony to present the Best British Group award, with Roman introducing them.
'To present our next award for British group are two genuine rock gods,' he said.

Viewers were left less than impressed by another Roman quip on Saturday night. The presenter called Green Day 'the America Busted' igniting the fury of fans 
'They have sold over 75 million records and released 14 albums - they are very much the American Busted. Please welcome from Green Day, Billie Joe Armstrong and Tré Cool.'
Viewers weren't impressed with the joke, with one tweeting: 'I think Green Day being called 'the American Busted' might be the most insulting thing I've ever heard. Ever. #BritAwards.' 
Another asked: 'Did he just call Green Day the American Busted #BritAwards.'
Elsewhere during the chaotic ceremony, Roman convinced Global Icon award winner Kylie Minogue to do a 'shoey' - an Aussie tradition which involves drinking out of a shoe.
Kylie seemed baffled by the skit, with one viewer tweeting: 'That interview with Kylie and Roman Kemp was so awkward. This year’s #BRITs makes the Mick Fleetwood/Sam Fox performance worthy of BAFTA Lifetime Achievement award.'

Raye broke records at Saturday night's BRIT Awards, winning six gongs during a star-studded ceremony at London's O2 arena.
The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada.
As well as Raye's huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
