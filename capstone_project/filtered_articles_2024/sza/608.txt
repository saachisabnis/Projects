The Celebrity Beat… 
The Grammys… like everything else these days…were kind of all about Taylor Swift.
Early in the night, Taylor won her 13th Grammy, for Best Pop Vocal.  That’s Taylor’s lucky number, of course.  And during her speech, she dropped an announcement on us:  She has a brand-new album on the way. It’s called “The Tortured Poets Department”, and it drops April 19th.  Get more details here.
Taylor also became the first person to win Album of the Year FOUR TIMES, when she won for “Midnights”.  Celine Dion presented that award, and she looked and sounded great, despite her health issues.
One thing Taylor did NOT do last night was mention Travis Kelce.  She also didn’t perform.  But there were some great performances last night.  Tracy Chapman was a “surprise” guest for Luke Combs’ version of “Fast Car”, and they crushed it.
Miley Cyrus seemed to be having the time of her life performing “Flowers”.  She even gave the song a little Tina Turner-style finish, and worked the fact that she’d just won her first Grammy into the lyrics.
She won for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers” which also won Record of the Year.  So now she has TWO Grammys.  And during her second acceptance speech, she may have snubbed her dad.  She did thank her mom, though…and revealed that she was COMMANDO.
Speaking of Tina Turner, Fantasia Barrino performed “Proud Mary” in her honor during the In Memoriam segment.  And yeah, she was the perfect choice.
Annie Lennox was also part of the In Memoriam package, delivering an emotional tribute to Sinead O’Connor, and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Billy Eilish won Song of the Year for “What Was I Made For”… which she also performed.
Joni Mitchell won Best Folk Album, and performed on the Grammy stage for the first time EVER, at the age of 80.  She did “Both Sides Now” with Brandi Carlile.
Jay-Z won the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, and brought Blue Ivy on stage with him to accept.  During his speech, he took a moment to call out the INJUSTICE of Beyoncé never winning Album of the Year.
He said, quote, “She has more Grammys than anyone and never won Album of the Year… Think about that…that doesn’t work.”
He added, quote, “Some of you are gonna go home tonight and feel like you’ve been robbed.  Some of you may get robbed.  Some of you don’t belong in the category.”
