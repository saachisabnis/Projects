SZA isn’t a fan of having her music categorized in a single genre as she believes it limits people from appreciating her full range as an artist.
In an interview with Dazed published on Wednesday (May 1), the 34-year-old superstar discussed her image in the public eye and how she has been marketed in a way that doesn’t justly reflect her material.

“The only reason I’m defined as an R&B artist is because I’m Black,” the New Jersey singer said. “It’s almost a little reductive because it doesn’t allow space to be anything else or try anything else. Justin Bieber is not considered an R&B artist; he is a pop artist who makes R&B, folk music, or whatever his heart desires.
“I simply just want to be allowed the same opportunity to make whatever I want without a label, [without it being] based on the colour of my skin, or the crew that I run with, or the beats that I choose. I want “F2F” to be seen as what it is. I want “Nobody Gets Me” to be seen as what it is. I want “Kill Bill” to be seen as what it is.”

She added: “At the same time, it’s nothing to get bent out of shape about, because it’s just how people are processing you. As long as I don’t process myself that way. I don’t necessarily box myself into anything. I’m just trying to make music, trying to vibe out and enjoy the experience.”
Whereas SZA clearly has her qualms about how she has been presented in the music industry, she hasn’t lost sight of how her fans continue to recognize her brilliance. Last month, she expressed her gratitude to her supporters for making her realize just how great of a song “Snooze” is, especially since she didn’t initially see its charm.
