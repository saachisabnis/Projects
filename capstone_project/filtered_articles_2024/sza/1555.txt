Jack Harlow‘s inaugural Gazebo Festival didn’t go as planned as severe weather put an end to the weekend early.
Harlow was set to headline the second day of the Louisville, Kentucky festival on Sunday (May 26) but organizers were forced to pull the plug due to tornado warnings.

A spokesperson for the festival said: “The safety of our patrons, artists and staff is paramount. Due to continuing hazardous conditions throughout the early afternoon and a second wave of weather expected this evening, we have made the very difficult decision to cancel the remainder of Gazebo Festival.”
Sunday ticket holders will receive a full refund, while weekend pass ticket holders will be refunded 50 percent of their ticket price. All refunds will be issued within 30 days, according to the festival.

Harlow also commented on the cancelation on his Instagram Stories.
“Well. We have to cancel day 2 of @gazebo. We are currently on a tornado watch. I know things cleared up a little bit but the bad weather has damaged the site and there are more storms and dangerous winds on the way. This means everyone on day 2 including myself won’t be performing anymore,” he wrote.
“I’m trying to focus on the positive because all I felt was happiness yesterday. I’m grateful for our flawless first day and for the way this city came together. Thank you so much. I’m sorry.”
