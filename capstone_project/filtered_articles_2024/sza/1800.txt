SZA impressed a lot of fans with her latest LANA album, but one co-sign in particular stunned her beyond belief. Shortly after she dropped her SOS Deluxe LP on Friday, December 20, the Grammy award-winning singer saw a post from Martin Scorsese's daughter Francesca praising her song "Scorsese Baby Daddy." In an Instagram Story, Francesca posted a photo of her father with the song in the background and a caption that said, "SZA queen s**t." Although she doesn't specifically sing about any of his movies in the song, SZA was shocked after she received the Scorsese family's blessing. 
â€œThe fact that this isnâ€™t AI, and it is actually Martin Scorsese ðŸ˜­," she captioned after she reposted Francesca's photo. SZA actually met Scorsese way before the album dropped. She was spotted in a photo of the revered Hollywood director while they attended the Wall Street Journal Magazine's 2023 Innovators Awards last year. It's possible that she was inspired to make the song after meeting him that night. "Scorsese Baby Daddy" is one of 38 songs that appear on SZA's LANA album. The project also includes her latest collaboration with Kendrick Lamar "30 For 30" as well as other stand-out tracks like "Chill Baby," "Kitchen," and "Crybaby," which appears at the end of her "Drive" music video with Ben Stiller. SZA's new project arrived a few months before she and K.Dot hit the road for their "Grand National Tour," where fans will get to see her perform all her new music.
