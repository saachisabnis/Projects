“I wanted to build a place where people can just come and be and it’s beautiful to see that y’all have been rocking with it. All this really started from my notebook, man, it’s crazy,” Tyler, The Creator, spoke humbly into the microphone, taking in the sight of the sold-out crowd on the first day of Camp Flog Gnaw’s 10th anniversary at Dodger Stadium.
The milestone celebration, which commenced on Nov. 16th, marked not just a decade of music, community, and artistic ingenuity, but also Tyler’s journey from scribbled notes and sketches to an empire. Those early sketches weren’t just any doodles, they included the now-famous donut motifs that became synonymous with Odd Future, appearing on shirts that sparked streetwear movements on Melrose Avenue and even on collaborative Vans sold globally. What began as raw, playful artistry evolved into a genre-defying festival, blending music, fashion, and community in a way that reflects Tyler’s unfiltered and childlike creativity.
From lively carnival games to surprise guests, there was always something to keep the adrenaline high. Unique food stalls paid homage to legends like MF Doom with themed treats, while museum installations celebrating the rich history of Odd Future provided fans with moments of reflection and nostalgia. Everywhere you turned, there was something to explore, celebrate, and soak in—a living, breathing embodiment of Camp Flog Gnaw’s eclectic spirit.
So, here are four highlights from the first day of Camp Flog Gnaw in honor of the 10th anniversary.
Among the standout attractions at Camp Flog Gnaw’s 10th anniversary was the Odd Future museum, an immersive and nostalgic tribute to the LA-based rap collective that reshaped hip-hop in the early 2010s. Curated by photographer and archivist Brick Stowell, the exhibit—dubbed “Almost Famous: A Look Into the World of OFWGKTA”—captured the raw, DIY spirit of Odd Future’s rise during their prime years between 2011 and 2016.
The experience began with a nod to an old-school carnival: after waiting in line, attendees stopped at a vintage-style ticket booth where they self-stamped their hands with a black “guest” mark. Inside, a massive photo mural of Tyler, The Creator and other Odd Future members stared down visitors, setting the tone for a journey back in time.
While walking through, it feels as if you’re transported into Odd Future’s world. Framed tour merch from Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt, vintage photographs, and other relics like Tyler’s arrest warrant from SXSW and tickets from a show where he was detained painted a vivid picture of the collective’s chaotic yet iconic legacy.
At the end of the exhibit, visitors had the chance to meet Stowell himself. He was stationed at a booth, signing copies of his book, taking photos with fans, and chatting about the golden era of OFWGKTA.
Marking a new chapter in his career, Tyler, The Creator’s newest record, “Chromakopia,” made its Camp Flog Gnaw debut during his headlining set. The album, which has spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 charts, is a testament to Tyler’s evolution as a multi-dimensional artist—seamlessly blending production, lyricism, and genre-defying creativity.
Over the past month, Tyler has teased fans with a string of visuals tied to the album, each supporting a recurring aesthetic: green military uniforms, shades of lime and grey, and a signature mask. This theme bled into the crowd at the festival, with fans donning matching palettes to honor the occasion. As the stage crew set up, the atmosphere was charged with anticipation. Ten minutes before showtime, the speakers were setting the tone with sounds normally heard at shipping docks off the coast. A massive green cargo container decorated with the Chromakopia title in black sat on stage. Once a light green strobe hit the cargo with Tyler emerging on top, the crowd erupted, screaming Chromakopia in unison.
When the moment finally arrived, Tyler wasted no time launching into “Chromakopia’s” lead single, “St. Chroma,” featuring Daniel Caesar, who had performed on the Camp Stage earlier. Tyler powered through highlights from the record, including “Rah Tah Tah,” “Noid,” and “Darling, I.”
As he paused to address the crowd, Tyler’s emotions were visible. “By the way, three weeks at number one with ‘Chromakopia’,” he shared. “Thank all of you for supporting me. To do that at my 10th carnival in my city . . . I don’t even have a heartfelt message. I’m really filled with so much love and joy. Thank every single one of you, on God.” It was a moment that encapsulated the weight of his decade-long journey, from his early days as Odd Future’s provocateur to becoming a Grammy-winning cultural force.
In a whirlwind of nostalgia, Tyler treated fans to a rapid-fire medley of tracks spanning his career. With each song receiving less than a minute, he sped through favorites like “Wusyaname,” “Lumberjack,” “Dogtooth,” “She,” “Earfquake,” and “Tamale,” drawing moshpits and fans singing back word for word.
After revisiting his past, Tyler dove back into “Chromakopia” to close out the night, delivering every moment with a palpable mix of joy and gratitude. Throughout the set, it was clear how much this milestone meant to him. His voice occasionally wavered, and at times, it seemed he was holding back tears as he looked out over a sea of fans who have supported him for over a decade. Rightfully so—this performance felt like a culmination of everything he’s built, from the rebellious beginnings of Odd Future to his status as one of music’s most innovative and celebrated artists.
One of the most talked-about attractions at Camp Flog Gnaw was the MM..Food pop-up diner, a tribute to the late MF DOOM and his iconic 2004 album, which turned 20 this year.
Widely regarded as a hip-hop masterpiece, MM..Food cemented DOOM’s legacy with its clever culinary-themed lyricism and abstract creativity—a perfect match for the festival’s eclectic spirit.
The diner, styled as “MF DOOM’s Diner,” featured signage in green, pink, and purple, mirroring the album’s iconic artwork. Fans lined up for blocks to experience the tribute, with a menu full of playful nods to the album, including “Beef Rapp,” “Deep Fried Frenz,” “Rapp Snitch Knishes,” and “Kookies” (two cookies with a glass of milk). Inside, retro diner tables and booths gave a nostalgic feel.
Beyond the food, the pop-up was a heartfelt celebration of DOOM’s influence. Its presence at Camp Flog Gnaw felt especially fitting, honoring an artist whose boundary-pushing creativity aligns with the festival’s ethos.
No matter which stage you were at or what time you arrived, there was no shortage of special guests throughout the day. Concrete Boys kicked things off early at 2:30 on the Camp Stage, surprising fans by bringing out a former member of the crew Lil Yachty, who—while not officially on the lineup—has been announced as a supporting act for Tyler’s upcoming Chromakopia world tour, with a string of Los Angeles dates starting on Feb. 14. Doechii followed with a show-stopping set at 3:35 p.m., elevating the energy by inviting R&B sensation SZA to join her for their collaboration, “Persuasive.” Once SZA announced, it felt as if everyone on the grounds raced to the stage to catch the duet.
The surprises continued throughout the evening. Alchemist’s set, aptly dubbed “Alchemist and Friends,” delivered on its promise, featuring a stacked lineup of collaborators, including Action Bronson, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, and Navy Blue. Finally, Tyler’s headlining set brought it all home. As he showcased songs from Chromakopia, he welcomed Sexxy Red for their track “Sticky,” Schoolboy Q for “Thought I Was Dead,” and Daniel Caesar for “St. Chroma.”
What made these guest appearances even more unique was how seamlessly they fit into the festival’s vibe. Most of the guests were either part of the official lineup or had long-standing creative ties to Tyler, further emphasizing the sense of community and collaboration that Camp Flog Gnaw represents.
As Doechii put it during her set, “I’m so happy to be here celebrating Camp Flog Gnaw. It’s more than a festival—it’s history, and we’re celebrating the weirdos in hip-hop. I love what Tyler’s been able to do for us.”
