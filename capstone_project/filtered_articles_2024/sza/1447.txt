SZA has confirmed that she will release a new album before the end of the year.
Appearing on Kai Cenat‘s 30-day “Mafiathon 2” livestream over the weekend, the TDE singer shed some light on her much-anticipated follow-up to SOS.

“There’s a whole new project that you will hear […] It will be out before the year is over,” she said.
The “Kill Bill” hitmaker didn’t divulge any more details, but she did tease a collaboration with Lil Yachty elsewhere during the stream.

“We were supposed to work on a song tomorrow and work in the studio and he was like, ‘I have to go to Kai’s,'” she revealed, before telling the Twitch star: “Make sure he makes it to the studio, on some real shit. ‘Cause somehow you just circumvented the session.”
She then praised Lil Boat’s musical talents, saying: “He’s a producer and a writer. I’m trying to be a better rapper. I feel like Yachty’s lowkey [talented as fuck]. Not even lowkey.”

It was teased in a recent Vogue cover story that SZA is currently working on two different projects. One is a deluxe edition of SOS and the other is her third album, which is called Lana.
Given SZA’s wording when speaking to Kai Cenat, it appears the project she’s gearing up to release in the coming weeks is Lana.

It was previously thought that Lana was the title of SOS’ deluxe edition, but that no longer appears to be the case.
The singer said of the project earlier this year: “So, we’ll make this really simple. Y’all leaked three songs from the deluxe. At this point, y’all can keep the throwaways and leaks. I’ll be starting ‘Lana’ from scratch. Do not ask me about it again. Thank you.”

She added: “I’ll round up the leaks y’all already got and u can have those. Seems like a fair deal. ENJOY.”
SZA has been teasing an expansion of her blockbuster sophomore album for a while.

Late last year, she posted a number of potential covers for the deluxe version and suggested the project would drop before Christmas, but it never did.
She also spoke about the project in an interview with Billboard, saying: “After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done. I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself and not just smiling and nodding at accolades but really feeling it internally and knowing that I’m good enough.”

She added: “I guess I need to stop trying to figure out what it means and start realizing and living in what it is.”
