Comedian Jess Hilarious flamed “The Breakfast Club” co-hosts Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy after they compared a young singer with an iconic R&B songstress.
When the pair said SZA is this generation’s Mary J. Blige on the air, Hilarious went in on the two hosts. The comedian took a blowtorch to Envy and Charlamagne because, according to her, their statements triggered a segment of Black people who were now negatively comparing SZA to Mary J.
Why Hilarious decided to cook the co-hosts could come from the fact that, in December 2022, the comedian officially announced that she was replacing Angela Yee on the show. However, Hilarious’ status is no longer certain.

No one seems to be certain about what happened to Hilarious’ candidacy. In an interview with TMZ, Charlamagne said he has no clue as to what is going on with the selection process. He added that he is “not happy” about the delay.
Since Hilarious’ December announcement, neither she nor the hosts and iHeart Radio have revealed any details on whether the popular comedian will join the show.
