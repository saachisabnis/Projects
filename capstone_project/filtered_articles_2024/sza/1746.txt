SZA has made an announcement. Known for unpredictable album releases and promotions, she has been hinting at a deluxe edition of SOS for nearly a year. On December 9, we officially entered the LANA era. SZA shared a strange video on social media. At first glance, its purpose is unclear, but those who watched until the end realized it marks the start of a new album cycle. Fans will get LANA sooner than expected.
The confusion about the video's intent comes from its content. It features SZA wandering alone in the forest, filmed from above, without any words or text. At one point, she stops, squats, and uses the restroom, leaving viewers to watch until she walks out of sight. Strange? Definitely. But the text "LANA (SOS Deluxe)" at the end confirms that SZA is back. Her caption, "clock starts now," adds to the excitement. She also hints at a new song that samples the Isley Brothers.
SZA initially wanted to release LANA earlier, but the creative process took longer than planned. In an interview with British Vogue, she explained, "I think I am making music from a more beautiful place... the lighter I get." In another interview, she mentioned that some leaks made her rethink the material and change the deluxe version of SOS.
Speaking to Billboard, SZA expressed her eagerness to turn the page on a specific musical chapter in her life. "After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done," she said. "I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself." While the new album trailer did not include a release date, an official announcement indicates it will be coming soon.
