Perry is slated to perform a medley of her greatest hits at the network's Video Vanguard Awards show on September 11th at New York's UBS Arena.

"Katy is a musical powerhouse and true pop culture icon. With her game-changing, creative vision, she has become a global phenomenon and taken over the world's biggest stages," said Bruce Gillmer, president of multiple music divisions at Paramount, in a press release from the Triple 7 PR agency.

The VMAs stretch back 40 years to when David Bowie, The Beatles and director Richard Lester shared the honor at the initial ceremony in 1984.

Perry first appeared on the VMAs in 2009 and with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry performed the classic Queen hit "We Will Rock You. "
She won three VMAs in 2011, for "Best Collaboration," "Video of the Year" and "Firework." She also performed at the awards in 2013 and 2014.
Perry will be joined at the VMAs this year by Camila Cabello, Chappell Roan, GloRilla, Rauw Alejandro and Sabrina Carpenter. Other performers are expected to be announced soon, according to Paramount.
Taylor Swift led the field of nominations with 10. Ariana Grande, Eminem, LISA, Megan Thee Stallion, Olivia Rodrigo, Post Malone, Sabrina Carpenter, SZA and Teddy Swims are among the top contenders.
Aside from her musical career, Perry has also been active in the philanthropic community. "Katy was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and has used her powerful voice to ensure every child's right to health, education, equality, and protection," he bio said. She has been involved in various other causes during her career, which saw her first headlining concert tour in 2009, which netted just over $1.5 million. She also performed at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show in Arizona.
