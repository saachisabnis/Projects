Amid cooling temps, the hottest event of the season was, in our biased opinion, the 2024 Club Cosmo Awards. And the coolest clique *insert that iconic TikTok snap* that debuted at the event? The members of Club Cosmo, of course. Hosted by UTA Next Gen in partnership with Cosmopolitan, the 2024 Club Cosmo Awards at ZCON (which took place on October 24) officially introduced the world to our inaugural class of Gen Z-focused trends, brands, and creators paving the way for future generations to come. And the event needed an equally impressive emcee to ensure the evening went off without a hitch. Enter: Davis Burleson. 
The content creator/host/genuinely cool person seamlessly blended humor and heart when announcing the 2024 Club Cosmo inductees, from Mean Girls star Avantika and the wonderful Aaron Rose Philip, to comedian Chloe Troast and my personal musical icon Harry Daniels.  Just moments before taking the stage, Davis took a beat to chat with Cosmopolitan about the significance of the evening and answer all of our burning questions about his TikTok show What’s Poppin’? With Davis!, his dream guest, and *that* Charli XCX interview. Buckle up! 
So many things! I go over my script like a million times. What’s so funny is I love to improvise, and so every time I do it, it’s different. But it’s good to get comfortable with what I’m saying is the way I look at it. 
I also always get knots in my stomach when I get anxious, so I make sure to eat right and order a bunch of different types of food. Like, today I had half a chicken sandwich and half an order of chicken nuggets too. I couldn’t decide! 
The list is so exciting because it’s really fun to see all of these trends getting their recognition. They really do make such a big impact. I mean take, for instance, the demure trend. That is such a great example of something that started so small and turned into literally a nationwide phenomenon with coverage on the Today show and Jimmy Fallon—everyone did it. And it’s really fun to be a part of that world as a TikToker and just see a trend grow and evolve.
I’m also a host on TikTok Radio on SiriusXM, so we talk about these trends every single day. I see them rise and I see them fall, so it’s really fascinating to be here tonight and see which ones are being awarded.
Well, I started making TikToks and comedy videos of myself just being crazy on the internet in 2020. And a company, Fallen Media, found me through those, called me in for a meeting, and was like, “What are your thoughts on creating some form of man-on-the-street style show on TikTok?” And I was like, “I’m all in.” Granted, I was a freshman in college and I knew nothing, but I was down.  
We started from zero followers and I was told to just go out there with my mask during COVID—and that I might get an iPhone. *laughs* So I went out in SoHo with my mini mic, literally in the freezing 20-degree weather, and I just tried my best. I was so excited because I was being paid $100 a week, and despite not knowing if it would really go anywhere, I still knew I had to put my best foot forward. But within a month, I had 100,000 followers and it just took off from there.
Charli is a queen. I’m obsessed with her, and she’s so, so nice. What’s funny is we’ve recently been having a lot of celebs come on the show, which has been awesome. And so with time, you begin to notice people’s different tendencies—some of them have security, some of them come with a posse of 20 people, some of them come alone. It just depends.
However, a lot of them understandably don’t really want to go into the public space of the park because there are so many people, and they don’t want potential crowds forming to take away from the interview. They also have to worry about their own security and those around them, too. With Charli, though? She was like, “I want to be in the park. I want the real deal. I want the real experience.” And she could not have been nicer. The video turned out so well—it was amazing! 
The dream—and I wait patiently every day—is Ariana Grande. I’m obsessed with her and have been since I was 13 years old. Like, I’d die to even have a moment with her.
She is on a big press run! I’ve been crossing my fingers because she’s been out and about. And Wicked comes out November 21, so we have time.  
Oh my gosh, thank you! That area is so fun because it’s like NYU’s campus, so lots of people around my own age are there. I’m also obsessed with anywhere that has a happy hour. I’m a big happy hour guy if I’m going out. Like, why not start at 5 or 6 as the sun’s coming down, right? So Bar Pisellino is one of my favorites. I love sitting outside, and all the workers there are actually French. 
The rumors are true! Okay, there we go. And they also have the best Aperol spritzes ever. Oh, and another place is NewsBar Café. I started going there every day to do my homework when I first moved to New York as a freshman. And now I go there all the time just for lunch with friends. I’ve just continued to visit, and I love seeing the staff. Plus I have a points card now, so I’m racking up my points. *laughs*
Ooh, an espresso martini. I will take all the energy in the world, no matter how. I’ll drink it, I’ll take it IV, anything. I love being caffeinated.
All right, we’re effing TikTok because it’s fun, it’s new, and it’s a little flirty.1 You never know what’s going to happen. We’re marrying SiriusXM because radio never dies, we love it, and anyone can listen to it, right? And then, I don’t know. Kill Instagram, I guess.
1. Full disclosure: During our convo, I said the word “fuck,” while Davis said “effing,” which meant (1) the Libra in me instantly felt like I was too abrasive with my wording, and (2) Davis’ media training outpaces even this journalist’s.
Sad because we love Instagram!
So many people. Someone I look up to is obviously Ryan Seacrest—he’s the best. I really, really look up to him, especially from the point when I first started hosting. But in terms of people who are other creators, I think Amelia Dimoldenberg has to be one of them. I love her. 
Exactly! And the reason why I find her so inspiring is because she actually started her show 10 years ago, and I didn’t know that. She just hit her 10-year anniversary. I remember seeing that and thinking, Wow, she’s been at this for a while. And, of course, in this industry, you always compare yourself to others, and everyone wants to be on the top of their game. But seeing her work ethic and how she’s never given up is so inspiring to me.
Chappell [Roan]. She definitely deserves the lead award for sure. I’m really into Gap these days, too. I think they’ve really evolved, and I love their basics. I just got a big order from them and told my friend earlier that when I put on their simple white T-shirt, I literally smiled. I just immediately thought of my childhood because I grew up going to Gap, so that’s another one.
I would say, “Follow your gut. And even though everyone’s going to laugh at you—friends from high school included—just keep going because they’ll eventually think what you’re doing is very cool. And what you end up pursuing is what you’re meant to.” 
For so long, I was very confused about what I wanted to do. I didn’t know if I wanted to do more comedy or posting and all that kind of stuff, but I really trusted my gut with everything, and I feel like that’s what has gotten me so far.
