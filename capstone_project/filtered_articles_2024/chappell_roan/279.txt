Stream sets by Chappell Roan, Deftones, Megan Thee Stallion and more from your living room
Lollapalooza returns to Chicago, Illinois this year, taking place at the city’s Grand Park. Find the line-up, stage times, and details on how to watch the festival online below.
Lollapalooza 2024 features a variety of headliners over its four days: Thursday’s Megan Thee Stallion and Hozier, Friday’s SZA and Stray Kids, Saturday’s The Killers and Future x Metro Boomin, and Sunday’s Blink-182 and Melanie Martinez.
Beneath the bill-toppers, however, lie a treasure trove of can’t-miss performances from Chappell Roan, Deftones, Skrillex, Laufey with the Chicago Philharmonic, Sexyy Red, Two Door Cinema Club, Ethel Cain, and Kesha, among others.
So it’s fortunate that Hulu will be live-streaming the festival once again this year. See all details below, including which acts will appear on the stream.
The four-day festival will take place at Grand Park in Chicago, Illinois from August 1-4.
The Lollapalooza 2024 live-stream is exclusive to Hulu subscribers in the US. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for a 30-day free trial, after which it’ll cost US$7.99 and upwards per month, depending on your chosen plan.
The festival will be streamed over two numbered channels on Hulu. It will not be available to stream on-demand, so the live-stream will be your only chance to watch these performances.
The set times for Lollapalooza 2024 have been confirmed. However, not all festival acts will appear on the live-stream – all times are CT. See the full schedule below.

The sole Lollapalooza 2024 dropout has been Tyler, The Creator, who did not give a reason for his sudden departure. “I made a commitment that I can no longer keep, and that bums me out knowing how excited folks were,” he wrote on social media. “That is not sexy at all. Please please forgive me or call me names when you see me in person. Love.”
A handful of tickets are still available here. They won’t be there for long, though.
