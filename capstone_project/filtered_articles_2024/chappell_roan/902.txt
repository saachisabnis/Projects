SCRANTON, LACKAWANNA CO. (WOLF) — The Historic Ritz theater in downtown Scranton is becoming a “Pink Pony Club” this Saturday for their Chappell Roan night.
Roan is a singer who has experienced a meteoric rise to fame, and now sells out every show she performs.
The Ritz brings a local and more affordable alternative to a Roan show, with this themed dance party.
This event is far from “Casual” and attendees are encouraged to dress  their “Super Graphic Ultra-Modern Girl” best for the dance party that will last a few hours “After Midnight.”
“Her shows are sold out everywhere, and I love what she brings, it just fits the Ritz so perfectly because she’s totally accepting. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen her concerts but if you’re not dancing, she’s calling you out, and I just love that she’s an open person and she’s completely who she is,” said local college student Jennifer Molenko.
This event, along with events like the Ritz’ upcoming Shrek Rave, a dance party dedicated to the ogre fairytale movie, are two unique events happening within the newly renovated building.
The building has become something of an entertainment ecosystem, where everyone is welcome, hosting a restaurant, tattoo shop, creamery, and a mead and wine bar.
Students looking to attend Chappell Roan Night or the Shrek Rave can enjoy student discounts, through the Ritz.
