Yesterday, Chappell Roan made her main stage debut at Lollapalooza 2024, and is going viral not only for the side of the crowd that she attracted.
Chappell Roan is currently all over X, formerly known as Twitter, for the side of the crowd that turned up to her 5pm main stage performance at Lollapalooza in Chicago’s Grant Park. One user wrote: "somebody behind me in the crowd during chappell’s set said they’ve been coming to lollapalooza for 18 years and have never seen a crowd that large at 5pm before……….yeah she definitely deserved/needed that main stage treatment".
Ahead of singing "My Kink Is Karma", she had the crowd erupting into applause as she said: "I dedicate this song to my ex who is bragging that they dated me at the bar in my home town. This is a message for your fiancé: "you should break up!".
