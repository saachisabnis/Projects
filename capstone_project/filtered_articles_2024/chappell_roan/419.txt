Teddy Swims’ soulful smash “Lose Control” is the No. 1 hit on Billboard’s year-end 2024 Hot 100 Songs chart.

	Meanwhile, Taylor Swift reigns atop the year’s Hot 100 Artists recap, marking her first career No. 1 finish in the category.

	Plus, three titles claim crowns on Billboard’s year-end charts reflecting the three metrics that contribute to the Hot 100. “Lose Control” is No. 1 for 2024 on Radio Songs; Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, leads Streaming Songs for the year; and Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” tops Digital Song Sales for 2024.

	Additionally, REPUBLIC rules the 2024 Hot 100 Labels ranking, marking its fourth consecutive victory, and its 11th in the last 13 years.

The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

	Billboard’s year-end music recaps represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts during the Oct. 28, 2023, through Oct. 19, 2024. Rankings for Luminate-based recaps reflect equivalent album units, airplay, sales or streaming during the weeks that the titles appeared on a respective chart during the tracking year. Any activity registered before or after a title’s chart run isn’t considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the October-October time period, account for some of the differences between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate.

	After debuting at No. 99 on the Aug. 26, 2023-dated Billboard Hot 100, Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” is the chart’s top title of 2024. It reached the top 10 on the Jan. 20-dated ranking and spent a week at No. 1 on the survey dated March 30. (The singer-songwriter, born Jaten Dimsdale, celebrated, with tequila, upon learning that the track had become his first Hot 100 leader, reasoning to Billboard, “It’s only 1 o’clock, but it’s 5 somewhere, ain’t it?”)

	The love song rules the year-end recap in large part from its steady stay in the weekly Hot 100’s top 10: With 45 frames to date, it trails only The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” (57 weeks in 2020-21) for the most time ever logged in the tier.

	“Lose Control,” on SWIMS Int./Warner Records, also topped five airplay charts: the all-format Radio Songs list, Adult Pop Airplay, Pop Airplay, Adult R&B Airplay and Adult Contemporary, becoming the first song to top all five tallies in nearly a decade. It additionally hit No. 2 on the rock-based Adult Alternative Airplay chart.

	“Teddy Swims has a timeless voice that breaks boundaries,” Warner evp of promotion and commerce Mike Chester told Billboard in July. “When we began promoting ‘Lose Control,’ our journey was carefully planned. From the start, we noticed that the song was resonating in various pockets of culture, creating a strong and diverse fanbase.”

	Taylor Swift wraps at No. 1 on the 2024 Hot 100 Artists chart, as she achieves the annual honor for the first time.

	Helping power her triumph, she made history – breaking her own record – when she charted the top 14 songs on the May 4-dated Hot 100, all from her album The Tortured Poets Department, which soared in atop the Billboard 200 that week. No artist had previously infused that many songs from the Hot 100’s top spot on down. She set the prior mark when she became the first act to boast the entire top 10 on the Nov. 5, 2022, chart as her album Midnights launched atop the Billboard 200.

	Leading Swift’s haul on the May 4 Hot 100, “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, debuted at No. 1. Meanwhile, during the 2024 chart year, Swift scored the most entries (56), top 40 hits (49) and top 10s (18) on the chart among all artists.

	Along with its domination on the 2024 Hot 100 Songs chart, Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” is the year’s No. 1 title on the Radio Songs recap. It led the weekly ranking for nine weeks in April-June. It’s also No. 1 on the year-end Adult Pop Airplay Songs chart and top five on Pop Airplay Songs and Adult R&B Airplay Songs.

	Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, leads the 2024 Streaming Songs chart. The plaintive track topped the weekly survey for four weeks late in the 2023 chart year and placed in the top 10 as recently as this April. It also tops Country Streaming Songs and Rock Streaming Songs for the year.

	Plus, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” finishes at No. 1 for 2024 on Digital Song Sales. It spent 13 weeks atop the weekly list during the year’s tracking period; through the Dec. 14-dated ranking, it has totaled 15 weeks at No. 1, the most for a song by one artist and no accompanying acts in the chart’s history. The party anthem also leads the year-end Country Digital Song Sales chart.

	After Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” at No. 1, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is No. 2 on the 2024 Hot 100 Songs chart, followed by Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” (No. 3); Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen (No. 4); and Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” (No. 5).

	Concurrently, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is No. 1 for the year on Hot Country Songs.

	Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” holds the No. 6 spot on the year-end Hot 100 Songs chart, followed by Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” (No. 7); Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” (No. 8); Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves (No. 9); and Hozier’s “Too Sweet” (No. 10).

	“Not Like Us” also leads both Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs for 2024; “Million Dollar Baby” banks the year-end No. 1 rank on Hot R&B Songs; “I Remember Everything” rules Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs; and “Too Sweet” tops Hot Alternative Songs.

	Below Taylor Swift atop Hot 100 Artists for 2024 (she is, thus, also No. 1 on Hot 100 Artists – Female), Sabrina Carpenter finishes at No. 2. Carpenter earned her first three top 10, and top five, Hot 100 hits this year: “Espresso”; “Please Please Please,” her first No. 1; and “Taste.” On the Sept. 7-dated chart, she became the first act since The Beatles in 1964 to chart three initial top five hits in the region simultaneously.

	Morgan Wallen places at No. 3 on Hot 100 Artists, having notched his second leader on the list, as featured on Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” which ran up six weeks at No. 1 in May-June. It also sizzled atop the season-ending Songs of the Summer chart. Wallen additionally leads the year-end Hot 100 Artists – Male category.

	Billie Eilish is No. 4 on the 2024 Hot 100 Artists chart, followed by Zach Bryan (No. 5); Teddy Swims (No. 6); and Kendrick Lamar (No. 7), after he scored two weekly No. 1s between April and July: “Like That,” with Future and Metro Boomin, and “Not Like Us.” Drake places at No. 8 on the year-end Hot 100 Artist recap, fueled in part by two top 10s in 2024, upping his career total to a record 78 top 10 hits; Benson Boone ranks at No. 9 and Chappell Roan is No. 10. The latter two acts each earned their first top 10s on the weekly Hot 100 in 2024: “Beautiful Things” and “Good Luck, Babe!,” respectively.

	REPUBLIC rules the 2024 Hot 100 Labels chart. The company wins its fourth consecutive title in the category (and its 11th in the last 13 years), fueled in part by two songs in the year-end Hot 100 Songs top 10: Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso.” Further hits by artists in the REPUBLIC family of labels including Noah Kahan, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Ariana Grande and Drake also contributed to the label’s top standing.

	Rounding out the Hot 100 Labels top five for 2024: Interscope Capitol Labels Group (No. 2), thanks to hits by artists on its roster including Kendrick Lamar, Billie Eilish and Eminem; Warner (No. 3; Teddy Swims, Benson Boone, Zach Bryan); RCA (No 4; Tate McRae, Doja Cat, SZA); and Columbia (No. 5; Hozier, Luke Combs, Beyoncé).
