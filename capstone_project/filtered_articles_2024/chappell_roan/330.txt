Chappell Roan’s performance drew a record-breaking crowd of 100,000+ — said to be the largest in Lollapalooza history.
CHICAGO, IL — The expertise of live sound engineers Malcolm Gil and Ben Rothstein converged at the 2024 Lollapalooza Festival, held in Chicago’s Grant Park from August 1-4, where they were part of the team supporting US breakout pop star Chappell Roan. In front of a record-breaking crowd and the high stakes of a major festival, the event was a massive undertaking. Here’s their story.
FOH Engineer Ben Rothstein
Ben’s Journey to Audio Engineering 
Ben Rothstein began his career in the audio world somewhat unexpectedly. After three semesters in a traditional university, he realized that the academic path he’d chosen wasn’t for him and decided to explore what truly excited him—live music. This passion led him to Full Sail University, where he built a solid foundation in audio engineering. Determined to work with the best, Rothstein pursued a position at Clair Brothers, the industry giant. Persistence paid off, and he landed the job, quickly advancing through various roles. “I’ve been with them for almost 18 years, starting as a PA tech and working my way up through various roles,” he shares. His career-defining moment came in 2018 when he was entrusted with mixing monitors for Queen.
Monitor Engineer Malcolm Gil
Malcolm’s Journey to Audio Engineering 
Malcolm Gil’s path was fueled by a lifelong passion for music. From playing in punk rock cover bands in his school days to discovering the world of audio engineering, Gil’s career trajectory was shaped by his love for sound. A personal relocation led him to San Diego City College, where a dedicated instructor recognized his potential. “That was where I truly got hooked,” Malcolm says, “working my first show with Snoop Dogg.” After gaining experience at Third Encore in Burbank, Gil took a leap into touring with a West Coast reggae band, Rebelution, in 2017, and has been on the road ever since. He now mixes for some of the biggest pop artists including Ice Spice, Khalid, Labrinth, and now Chappell Roan.
Working at Lollapalooza 
Gil, serving as both monitor engineer and stage manager, was responsible for managing 12 stereo mixes for the artist, band, and crew. The challenge was heightened by the rapid rise in the artist’s popularity, which led to an afternoon set without a sound check. “This ‘throw and go’ situation added a lot of pressure,” Gil explains. Without the luxury of a dedicated soundcheck, everything had to be set up swiftly and flawlessly. However, he still managed to handle the situation effectively, noting, “For me, the Avid S6L console was crucial because it’s reliable. The workflow and the easy patching capabilities help me even with limited time.”
Rothstein’s role was equally critical, after being thrust into the FOH position shortly before the massive Lollapalooza show. At Lollapalooza, he was tasked with mixing the show at front of house and generating broadcast stems. The logistical challenges were daunting, from balancing the nuances of live sound with the complexities of broadcast audio. However, with careful preparation, Rothstein ensured everything was ready. During the show, he focused on delivering the best possible mix, leveraging Avid’s technology to meet the demands of both the live audience and the broadcast.
The festival turned out to be a huge success, with Chappell Roan’s performance on the opening day of the festival drawing a record-breaking crowd of 100,000+ — said to be the largest in Lollapalooza history. Even under the high-pressure conditions, Rothstein and Gil pulled off an incredible show that allowed Chappell to shine. Despite having no soundcheck, they proved their technical skills and delivered flawlessly. This moment not only cemented Roan’s rise as a star but also spotlighted the behind-the-scenes team whose work made the performance a standout at one of the world’s biggest music festivals.
Ben and Malcolm’s Experience with the Avid VENUE | S6L 
And what advice would these engineers share for those wanting to work in the live sound environment?
“In live sound engineering, we recommend the Avid S6L console because its virtual soundcheck feature allows for efficient pre-show preparation. It lets you work closely with artists to fine-tune mixes without the pressure of a live performance. This system saves time and offers the flexibility to make real-time adjustments while keeping the environment calm and professional. Additionally, being adaptable, planning for backups, and having a deep understanding of your gear are essential for success.”
