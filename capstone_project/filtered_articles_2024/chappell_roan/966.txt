The joy of covering pop music in Southern California is that there is just so much of it. That’s also the worst thing about it, too.
Each year we head out to stadiums and arenas and theaters and clubs to check out hot new acts, legends with long legacies, and festivals packed with every flavor of music imaginable.
Yet there’s always one more you wish you could have caught. And sifting through the highlights of the year can be painful. Does Pearl Jam at the Kia Forum make the Top 10? Lana Del Rey’s headlining turn at Coachella? Vampire Weekend at the Hollywood Bowl?
All were great. Alas, none made the cut.
Music reporters Peter Larsen, Holly Alvarado and Charlie Vargas were out there, all night and sometimes all day in 2024, and here present their top concerts and festival sets in no particular order.
Chappell Roan and Raye at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Look at us, cheating with a two-fer right off the bat. But Chappell Roan with her drag queen aesthetic and catchy synth-pop songs and the British modern soul singer Raye were two of the biggest breakouts of the festival this year. Roan, we wrote at the time, felt “like she’s about to get much bigger fast,” and after Coachella, she went supernova on the festival scene. Raye, whose art is classy cool to Roan’s trashy fun, deserves to do the same. See the Coachella reviews of the days they performed here and here.
 Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Kia Forum, Inglewood: Eight years after his last Southern California shows, Springsteen returned with a roar, playing three hours and 20 minutes of hits and deep cuts in the first of two sold-out shows at the Forum. The man is 75 now and who knows how many more times we’ll get this chance. Don’t pass it up if it comes. See the review and photos here.
Kraftwerk at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles: This German electronic band has influenced pop, rock and dance music for more than half a century. These days the group doesn’t tour so much as do residencies here and there, which is how it came to Los Angeles for nine nights in May, playing a different one of its classic albums and hits every night. We caught night three and the album “Trans-Europe Express,” and would have gladly gone to more, time and money permitting. Kraftwerk returns in 2025 to play at Coachella. See the review and photos here.
Missy Elliott at Crypto.com Arena, Los Angeles: We’re accidentally in a run of shows by artists who haven’t played Southern California in a while. For Elliott, a star since the ’90s, the rarity was even more extreme. Her two sold-out shows at Crypto.com Arena in July were mind-blowingly great nights of music, dance, fashion. Call it art because that’s what it was in every sense of the word. See the review and photos here.
The Rolling Stones at SoFi Stadium, Inglewood: Mick and Keith are both 81 now, so there’s hope for Bruce Springsteen and his fans, we suppose. The ever-rolling Stones remain an astonishing, ageless (wrinkles aside), reminder of just how terrific classic rock ‘n’ roll can be. Start me up? When’s the last time the Stones weren’t in the driver’s seat, key in the ignition, revving up the motor? (In 2024, Southern California also enjoyed great vintage rock from artists including David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Jeff Lynne’s ELO, too.) See the review and photos here.
PJ Harvey at the Greek Theatre, Los Angeles: Polly Jean Harvey came to L.A. with a new album, “I Inside the Old Year Dying,” an adaptation of her 2022 novel-in-verse – written in the ancient Dorset language of her English home county. It’s heady stuff, a mythic trip to an in-between world of magic and myth, but fans were right there with Harvey as she played the full album before slipping into older favorites. British post-punk band The The did the same thing in 2024, playing its new album in full before doing the old stuff. We approve this trend. See the review and photos here.
Joni Mitchell at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles: After a brain aneurysm nine years ago, the thought that Joni Mitchell might never again play live felt very real. But after years of rehab and recovery, and the support of Brandi Carlile and many other musicians who love her, Mitchell played two nights at the Hollywood Bowl in October, singing 27 songs over three hours in what anyone who was there will forever remember as a magical night of music and emotions. See the review and photos here.
Sting at the Wiltern Theatre, Los Angeles: Sting shook things up for his Sting 2.0 Tour in 2024, shedding the larger bands he’s built in recent years in a return to a power trio format like his former band the Police. Add to that the tour played smaller theaters — five nights at the Wiltern in November — and the show felt fresh, more powerful in its music and emotional heft than any he’s played here of late. See the review and photos here.
Sabrina Carpenter at Crypto.com Arena, Los Angeles: Sabrina Carpenter caught a ton of love for her strong set at Coachella in April, but the real deal — her Short ‘N Sweet Tour — made an even bigger impression when it reached Los Angeles for three nights at the end of November. Carpenter’s confident, sexy performance and terrific production design made this perhaps the flashiest spectacle after Missy Elliott’s shows this year. Add to that a surprise guest turn with Christina Aguilera and this was one for the year if not the ages. See the review and photos here.
Billie Eilish at Kia Forum, Inglewood: This year, before Billie Eilish turned 23 on Dec. 18, she won her second Oscar, guested with Lana Del Rey at Coachella, released a new album “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” and came home to Los Angeles on Dec. 15 to launch a five-night run of sold-out shows at the Kia Forum. There’s a confidence and sophistication ever-growing for this young woman with an old soul. Few stars have brighter futures. See the review and photos here.
Tyler, The Creator at Camp Flog Gnaw, Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles: Some might say 2024 was the year of Tyler, The Creator — and they’d have a strong case. The Los Angeles rap icon dominated the charts with “Chromakopia,” his latest record, which spent three consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. He headlined this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival with a jaw-dropping set, celebrated the 10th anniversary of his beloved Camp Flog Gnaw festival with a sold-out weekend at Dodger Stadium and expanded his Golf Le Fleur brand to include clothing, shoes, perfumes, and even bedding. His headlining set on Nov. 16 was a vibrant celebration of his evolution, featuring lush green aesthetics, new tracks, and a gathering of what Tyler calls “hip-hop’s greatest weirdos.” See the review and photos here.
Doja Cat at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Doja Cat closed out Coachella 2024 with a performance that cemented her status as one of pop music’s boldest visionaries. Her set leaned heavily on tracks from her 2023 album “Scarlet,” blending provocative themes with flashy visuals. From the moment she and her dancers appeared as sasquatch-like creatures for “Demons” and “Tia Tamera,” it was apparent this wouldn’t be your typical festival set. By the finale, she’d taken things to a mesmerizing level: dancing in a mud pit on a satellite stage. See the review and photos here.
Doechii at Camp Flog Gnaw, Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles: Doechii brought undeniable energy to the 10th anniversary of Camp Flog Gnaw, delivering a set that showcased her dynamic artistry and rising star power. Her performance was a masterclass in stage presence, with electrifying choreography and seamless transitions that had the crowd fully captivated. Highlights included a surprise appearance by SZA for their collaboration “Persuasive,” a moment that sent the audience into a frenzy. See the review and photos here. 
Caifanes at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles: On June 5, Mexican rock legends Caifanes delivered a memorable performance at the Hollywood Bowl, sharing the stage with fellow Latin rock icons Café Tacvba. The evening was a celebration of rock en español, with fans spanning multiple generations coming together to witness this historic event.  See the review and photos here. 
Santana at Fool In Love Fest, Hollywood Park, Inglewood: As the sun dipped below the horizon on Aug. 31, the Fool In Love Fest reached its crescendo with a captivating performance by Santana. Commanding the Fool stage, the legendary Mexican guitarist thrilled a massive crowd that overflowed well beyond the designated area, with fans spilling into the adjacent Love stage to catch a glimpse of his artistry. See the review and photos here. 
Victoria Monét at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Fresh off winning Best New Artist at the 66th Grammy Awards, Victoria Monét took Coachella by storm with a Sunday evening performance that radiated soul and groove. The R&B artist effortlessly captivated the crowd with a seamless mix of tracks from her acclaimed “Jaguar II” album, showcasing her rich vocal range. See the review and photos here. 
Porter Robinson, Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles: On Oct. 11, 2024, Porter Robinson took the stage at the Hollywood Bowl, delivering a performance that reflected nearly a decade of artistic evolution. The setlist, which opened with tracks from his recent “Smile!” album, took the audience through pivotal moments in his career, blending his early electronic work with new sounds. As the first notes of “Knock Yourself Out XD” rang out, a visual timeline of the “Smile!” era unfolded on the screens, connecting past and present. Fans were treated to a journey through Robinson’s musical growth, much like the way Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour celebrated different phases of her career. See the review and photos here. 
Elle King at Stagecoach Festival, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Elle King returned to Stagecoach Festival on April 26, delivering an early Sunday performance that resonated with both longtime fans and new listeners. With a setlist that blended her signature hits and songs from her latest album, “Come Get Your Wife,” King showcased her powerful vocals and unique ability to merge country, rock, and blues. See the review and photos here. 
SZA at Jingle Ball, Intuit Dome, Inglewood: At Jingle Ball on Dec. 7, SZA delivered a spiritually charged performance. As the clock struck 11:11, marking her connection with angel numbers, the anticipation for her set skyrocketed. Emerging from a spaceship surrounded by greenery and towering tree branches, she transformed the arena into a nature-filled dreamscape. Her setlist spanned her career, from “SOS” hits like “Kill Bill” and “Snooze” to “Ctrl” favorites like “Broken Clocks” and “The Weekend.” See the review and photos here.
Beck at Almost Acoustic Christmas, Kia Forum, Inglewood: The coolest loser in town, aka Beck, graced the stage at KROQ’s 33rd annual Almost Acoustic Christmas at the Kia Forum on Dec. 14, delivering a performance that blended his eclectic style with the festive spirit of the event. The setlist featured a mix of his classic hits and fan favorites, including “Loser,” “Devils Haircut,” “The New Pollution,” “Wow,” “Debra,” “Dreams,” “E-Pro,” and “Where It’s At.” See the review and photos here. 
Avatar: The Last Airbender LIVE in Concert at Fox Performing Arts Center, Riverside: There is no shortage of orchestral ensembles crossing the lines into pop culture categories. It was only a matter of time before fans of an animated series started to get their moment, too. The production for the live orchestra of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” was phenomenal, especially with its authentic incorporation of Asian instrumentation that gives the series its signature sound. Read the preview here.
Bizarrap at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Argentine hitmaker Bizarrap gave an electric Coachella performance with an energy resembling the atmosphere of major EDM acts that remain a festival staple. To top it off, Bizarrap invited Colombian superstar Shakira to perform their collaborative diss track “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” which helped snowball Shakira back onto the charts. See the review and photos here.
Carin León at Stagecoach, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Balladeer Carin León was one of the few acts to perform at both Coachella and Stagecoach. His debut at the country music festival was celebratory and historic as the first artist to perform mainly in Spanish at Stagecoach. León came out to the packed Palomino stage, taking tequila shots and singing a cover of Johnny Cash’s “Man in Black.” The performance turned into a regional Mexican music dance party, but it still felt like a country fest in spirit. See the review and photos here.
Cigarettes After Sex at Kia Forum, Inglewood: Stadium shows are typically filled with high-energy acts, but Cigarettes After Sex is the antithesis of that. Yet the band sold out massive shows worldwide, including three Southern California dates. After seeing the group live, there was no speculation as to why its fanbase is so enthralled. The performance at the Kia Forum was a peaceful, dreamlike pop set that stayed true to the band’s discography and showed why they’re a force to be reckoned with. Read the review here.
Cowboy Bebop LIVE at Fox Performing Arts Center, Riverside: Another concert I still think about at least once a week was the live performance of the animated series “Cowboy Bebop.” The show was created by curator and leader of the Bebop Bounty Big Band Corey Paul, who is major a fan of the series, which added an extra layer of energy and uniqueness to the overall production. While the 14-piece jazz ensemble delivers a funky, spirited performance, the audience is treated to a chronological telling of the animated show that inspires anticipation, laughter and tears. Read the preview here.
Khruangbin at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Psychedelic funk trio Khruangbin makes instrumental music that fits any mood. The band’s Coachella performance had a beautiful set design that resembled the light pink and blue hues of the color scheme art from their fourth album, “A La Sala,” which translates as “To The Living Room.” On theme, the stage exuded what it feels like to pop in a relaxing vinyl record on a Sunday afternoon and dissociate into the cosmos. Read the review here.
Leon Bridges at Stagecoach, Empire Polo Field, Indio: One of the best performances at this year’s Stagecoach was by Leon Bridges. He headlined the Palomino stage right as the sun was getting ready to set, providing a fitting atmosphere for his soft hymns. The crowd poured out of the tent so much that there were even large crowds around the monitors displaying his performance. Bridges channels a calming presence with his music that speaks to a fanbase that goes beyond the confines of genres. See the review and photos here.
No Doubt at Coachella, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Coachella’s lineup was full of nostalgia this year, and one of those acts that channeled it best was No Doubt. The group proved ska is not dead and invited pop star and fan Olivia Rodrigo, who is carrying the torch for the female-fronted rock bands that inspire her music. The performance included plenty of hits such as “Keep On Dancing,” “Ex-Girlfriend,” and No Doubt’s cover of Talk Talk’s “It’s My Life.” It was fun to see the group having a great time performing together, and the plaid outfits that were a staple of the fashion. See the and photos review here.
Speed at The Observatory, Santa Ana: During the coronavirus pandemic, social media clips and music videos of Speed, the Australian beatdown hardcore group, were popping up on several different feeds, drawing the attention of hardcore heavyweights such as Knocked Loose and others like Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. Speed is a raw display of hardcore music, and the band’s performances can often lead to the most aggressive stage diving and mosh pits imaginable. Just watch your neck. Read the preview here.
Trampled by Turtles at Stagecoach, Empire Polo Field, Indio: Besides having an excellent band name, Trampled by Turtles is a rapid set of bluegrass/folk-country performers. The 6-piece band used violins, banjos, guitars and several other stringed instruments to draw a sizable crowd at the country festival and offered a sound that was uniquely theirs. You can’t help but wonder why you don’t know more bluegrass/folk artists and if others make the genre sound just as cool. Read the review here.
