The Pink Pony Club has a lot of dancers. CNN reports that Chappell Roan’s set at Lollapalooza over the weekend might be the largest crowd in the festival’s history. A spokesperson for the festival told the outlet, “Chappell’s performance was the biggest daytime set we’ve ever seen. It was a magical moment added to Lolla’s DNA.” While there are no exact numbers on how many people attended her set, the festival did post a photo of the massive audience that looks like it covered the entire southern area of the park. Vulture has reached out to Lollapalooza to confirm the exact number of attendees for her set. San Francisco will have to get Golden Gate Park ready for Roan, as she is taking over the main stage on Sunday afternoon at Outside Lands. Childish Gambino currently has the record for the largest crowd at the Bay Area festival, with an estimated 90,000 attendees. This is a message to all other festival organizers: If Chappell Roan is on the schedule, you better make some space, or good luck, babe.
