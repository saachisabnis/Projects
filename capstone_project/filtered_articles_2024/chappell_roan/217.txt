On a closer look, Doja did relatively perform poorly last cycle, following her stunts. Woman, a residue track from an already well-nominated era, got into ROTY. PTTR missed despite peaking at the perfect time and being a lead.
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
On a closer look, Doja did perform poorly last year, sequel to her stunts. Woman, a residue track from an already well-nominated er,a got into ROTY. Meanwhile PTTR missed despite peaking at the perfect time and being a lead. 
she still got 3 nominations last year despite the GF shutout, so performed poorly is kinda a stretch
chappell roan has become so annoying, and as much as i would like for this to affect her chances let’s be real it won’t. if someone like doja can manage to be nominated yearly after a controversy every year, chappell has nothing to worry about
This. It’s crazy to me after seeing Kanye getting nominated in AOTY after literally pissing on a Grammy, that people think voters care about Chappell’s interviews lol
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time”
She’ll get the nominations for sure, but I’m no longer sold on her winning. We’ll see how her campaigning goes.

Waiting for Sabrina to win so y’all can see it was never a competition.
You guys are doing too much over Chappell. lol.
anyways Doechii should be winning BNA and getting nominated across the GF
Honey, voters will NOT give a shit about any Chappell Roan controversy.
about half of you sound absolutely ridiculous btw
