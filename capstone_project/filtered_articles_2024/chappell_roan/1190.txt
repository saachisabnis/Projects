The holidays are on the horizon, and fans of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan got a real treat yesterday on Netflix.
The two pop stars, who are definitely enjoying their renaissance currently, debuted a performance for Carpenter’s Netflix special, A Nonsense Christmas. Roan and Carpenter performed a stunning, modernized rendition of the 1984 hit “Last Christmas” by English pop group Wham!
You can watch a clip of the performance below, and the whole of the special via Netflix:

The duet opens in what looks like the end of an energetic holiday party, with empty bottles and red Solo cups littering the set. The two crooners dove into their performance of the song not entirely unlike a drunken karaoke session, but not a single note was missed or slurred.
“The holidays have always been so special to me,” Carpenter said in a statement ahead of the release of A Nonsense Christmas. “I am excited to bring my take to a classic holiday variety show, infusing my love of music and comedy to make something that is uniquely me.”
The title of the special is a reference to Carpenter’s song “Nonsense” from her album Emails I Can’t Send. Carpenter recently released a holiday-themed remix of the song.
While Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter did “Last Christmas” justice with their performance, you just can’t beat the original work. English pop duo Wham! released the modern Christmas tune back in 1984. It’s made multiple resurgences in the years since and even peaked at no. 4 on the Hot 100 chart back in 2023. Wham! might be giving Mariah Carey a run for her money this year.
Carpenter’s Netflix special is her very first holiday-themed television special, and she didn’t take on the glittery venture alone. A number of artists appear on the special as well. Tyla performed a lovely rendition of the song “This Christmas”, while country crooner Shania Twain performed a duet with Carpenter of “Santa Baby”. Kali Uchis also delivered a lovely rendition of “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus”.
A Nonsense Christmas also features a number of songs from Carpenter’s 2023 EP, Fruitcake.
