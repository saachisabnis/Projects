The one-off festive show arrived over the weekend
Shania Twain has reflected on working with Sabrina Carpenter on the latter’s new Christmas special, and said that she “spent the entire shoot laughing”.
Titled A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter, the one-off special arrived on Netflix over the weekend, and was described as a “holiday variety music special” from the pop star.
It saw Carpenter playing a range of festive songs, both original and classic, while being joined by an array of stars including Chappell Roan, Tyla, Shania Twain, Kali Uchis, Nico Hiragua, Quinta Brunson, Cara Delevingne, Kyle Mooney, Megan Stalter, Sean Astin, Owen Thiele and Jillian Bell.
Now, Twain has shared an update on what it was like to work on the Netflix special, and told fans how the idea to collaborate with the ‘Espresso’ singer arose.
“What do you say when  @SabrinaAnnLynn calls you up and asks if you want to sing a Christmas song together? Obviously you say ‘Sure, I would love to sing with you Sabrina!’,” she wrote on Twitter on Friday (December 6).
“When I tell you I had the most fun shooting A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina I’m not exaggerating, she is so funny, I basically spent the entire shoot laughing! You can watch our cute duet together tonight.”
Carpenter also went on to respond to the tweet, reposting the update with the caption: “I adore you Shania!!!!!”

In other Sabrina Carpenter news, her track ‘Bed Chem’ was recently named as one of NME’s Best Songs of 2024. “Sabrina Carpenter has made owning her sexuality an art – to the point she’s had to deny being ‘the horniest girl in the world’,” it read. “‘Bed Chem’ hasn’t helped matters. Full of cheeky lyrics (“Come right on me, I mean camaraderie”) and winking euphemisms, this is the song that should have been as ubiquitous as ‘Espresso’.”
As for Shania Twain, earlier this summer the singer took to the Glastonbury Pyramid Stage for the 2023 Legends slot – breaking out some of the biggest hits from across her discography.
In a three-star review, NME wrote: “At times, Shania seems genuinely overawed by the enormity of the audience, tumbling off stream-of-consciousness mutterings that makes you wonder what happened to the slick patter she presumably brings to her Las Vegas residencies.
“She wonders how “you make it to pee” when you’re in a crowd at a festival. If you had a quid for every time Shania says she’s “grateful” to be here, you could turn Worthy Farm into your own personal cattle ranch,” it added.
“By the time she inevitably closes with ‘Man! I Feel Like A Woman!’ and pink flares stream across a field full of cowboys and gals belting it out karaoke-style (“Man’s shirts! Short skirt!”), you’d have to admit she’s revved the crowd up pretty well.”
