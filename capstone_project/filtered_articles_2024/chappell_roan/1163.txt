The frontman for Chimney Dream, Eli Snider, went viral with his craigslist ad seeking a drummer during the last week of October. A craigslist ad looking for a drummer may not seem like the most interesting thing to go viral on the internet, but Eli's add in the Denton, TX area had a pretty interesting requirement. He was looking for a 70-year-old, drummer to perform in his heavy metal Chappell Roan cover band.
The idea started out as a joke in a discord group, but it eventually grew a quest of age, wisdom, and talent. Snider saw an ad that was asking for a drummer between the ages of 18 and 20. Someone online said that they thought the request was ageist. Snider then decided to send the ad looking for the 70-year-drummer as a smart-alecky response to that person. However, someone soon encouraged Snider to post the add for real.
In the beginning he got a few emails telling him that people thought the idea was cool, but now he's getting messages saying everything from band name recommendations to condolences that they can't get their grandparents to audition for him.
The traction on the article picked up when Chappell Roan drummer, Lucy Ritter, put the post in her Instagram stories.
Unfortunately, the search for his septuagenarian drummer isn't going great. He says that "every time I send a death metal example song, they don't know if they can do that." Snider says that since the search for someone in their 70s isn't turning up a huge candidate pool he is considering going as young as 60.
