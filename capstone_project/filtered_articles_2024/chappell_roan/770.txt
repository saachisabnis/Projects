The extremely talented Chappell Roan recently released her latest single "Good Luck, Babe!" and it was the perfect song to drop after the rising star exploded onto the pop scene when she released her debut studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September of 2023, contributing to her being named iHeartRadio's latest On The Verge artist! 
Her latest single, "Good Luck, Babe!", is a way of her saying good luck to a special person who is avoiding the desire and feeling of wanting to be with someone. The catchy tune was paired perfectly with a bright-colored lyric video that gave us all a nostalgic feeling. 
Chappell has had quite the year for herself. She recently wrapped up opening for Olivia Rodrigo during her GUTS tour and kicked off a string of festival appearances by performing a handful of sets at Coachella.
Chappell has sold out all of her headlining concerts by creating a community of listeners who love her gutsy anthems as well enjoy attending her shows where shes built her "own fantastical musical universe—one that celebrates queer expression and honoring your true self."
"It feels like a community," Chappell says of her shows. "You’re allowed and encouraged to dress up crazy, because everyone else will be too."
For her drag-inspired shows, she sets themes and her fans dress the part with fabulous outits. Her themes come from her songs, like pink rhinestone cowgirl, a "Pink Pony Club" theme, or a red-and-black "My Kink Is Karma" theme.
