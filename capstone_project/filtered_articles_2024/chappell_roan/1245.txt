Home    Forums    Music    Grammy for Best New Artist (67th Grammys edition)
Category fraud my ass all these folks has been making music for years, its like y’all don’t remember who won last year 😭. All of a sudden the guns are out for Sabrina but in the same breath yall would predict Chappell, Raye & Shaboozey… but “Sabrina has 6 albums” like the voters definitely knows Sabrina Carpenter’s teenage Disney pop girl albums like let’s be serious. The story of success doesn’t come overnight and to keep trying when all thing seems to fail would be a great message for a music academy. And I’m still trying to figure out how Chappell is more artistic than Sabrina, is it the extra make up, the theatre kid y’all relate too??? TRAFOMP has 2 points more in critics than Short n’ Sweet… where’s the extra artistic points goldderby user giving her for. Cuz that album wasn’t a masterpiece either. 
this. i really do not get the “artistry” arguments about chappel roan, she is not some inventive, alternative niched artist ala fiona apple in her debut. actually she makes simple pop songs just like sabrina.
Chappell’s “artistry” is the second-biggest industry propaganda this year, after BRAT ofc.
What musical skills exactly, besides modest co-writing? Is it the face painting, power ranger outfits, yodelling or prancing about the stage without coordination? 
As Baby asked, are we talking about makeup artistry? Cause she ain’t doing a good job there either 😂
I’m struggling here, just need one proof, throw me a bone someone, make me see the error of my ways, cause I see NaN, Nil, Nada, Zilch…
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
I’m biased (so that’s the argument) but I think Chappell’s narrative has to do with the perception about Pop. Sabrina is seen more as a hitmaker a la Justin Bieber/Katy Perry 2010 while Chappell is tilted more to the Billie Eilish side where even if she doesn’t maintain her success for long she will still have the respect of critics and music snobs.
It's me... Hi

Sabrina has way more acclaimed music than Katy and Justin ever had. That’s the reason. She’s a hitmaker and doing good with critics
Sabrina is campaigning her ass off, so I wouldn’t be surprised if she takes this one. But I’m inclined to believe that her great year will be capped off with a Best Pop win.  That will be her consolation.  Chappell Roan is extremely popular and ticks all the box for a winner here. Plus, she has won all other major BNA awards. Prediction: Chappell Roan
Doechii is really blowing up, but it’s so hard to beat Sabrina or Chappell. I think Rap Album is her prize.
25 years ago Christina won BNA and 25 years later her daughter Sabrina Carpenter bout to win BNA at 25 😝 history repeats itself
Man I would love to see Doechii take this but this is Chappell’s. You could feel that industry support behind her. Her build up from doing the festivals and other acts loving and sharing her songs. It will be a very deserved win.
if sabrina and chappell split the vote, who takes this?
To me it doesn’t really make sense for them to split votes and have a third person win. If they were smaller artists that only a certain group of people listened to, I’d get it, but they’re two of the biggest pop stars of 2024, literally anyone can appreciate them. I’d be super shocked if anyone else wins.
if sabrina and chappell split the vote, who takes this?
Doechii did quite a bit during the voting period. So did Shaboozey. They seem most likely next in line, but I don’t think there will be a significant vote split between Chappell and Sabrina. They’re two completely different artists who just happen to be in the same genre with similar, yet distinctive fanbases. There will be places to reward them both, I think. Here I’m still predicting Chappell.

Yeah, my guess would be Shaboozey if they did, but I agree that I don’t see them vote splitting.
