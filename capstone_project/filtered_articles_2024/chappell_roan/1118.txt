The 50th season of Saturday Night Live has been full of surprises. We were gifted with a new “Digital Short” from Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer, the sensational Sushi Glory Hole (c’mon, hear them out!), and former castmembers Maya Rudolph, Dana Carvey, and Andy Samberg have returned for election season to play Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and Doug Emhoff, respectively. 
Related, if you’re a fan of the show’s classic “Digital Shorts,” we highly recommend listening to The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast. It’s a cozy mix of silly and informative.
