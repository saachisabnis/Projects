Another reason why Pitchfork is zero credible :
.@pitchfork your #GRAMMYs “predictions” include multiple songs that were not even submitted (Girl so confusing, Me & U, Espresso in SOTY)… a glaring mistake for a supposed major publication to make.

Something we didn’t talk yet: Do someone think that the whole Beyonce viral nonsense will affect her at the Grammys in some way? Could she get more votes from people who want to show their support? Or could it hurt her results? Or it’s totally irrelevant? 
Just wanted to echo  @daniel’s post on the last thread about Tinashe being presented as a new Victoria, and add that “Nasty” is also an Urban radio flop, which “On My Mama” wasn’t (toppes the format)

After Biden had to go on TV and say federal government can’t control the weather, I doubt nothing!
On topic: Beyoncé will lead the noms as usual.
Been obsessed with the acoustic version of Beautiful Things, since last nights episode of Dancing with the Stars. Such a beautiful song.  Maybe Benson will sneak into SOTY. 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Personally I think this situation could help her in the way that she was on spotlight during the first round of voting. She was silent during the summer but now she was one of the most talked artists + the Levi’s Jeans campaign. That’s enough for people to remember she has a new record out. 
Also, I was predicting Beyoncé’s underperformance but due to what I said before, I think she will get those 7-9 nominations. Actually, I added her to my Best Pop Solo Performance predictions. I checked previous years and I think she was nominated there every year she was eligible lol

She was also eligible for Pop Duo/Group Performance but missed out on both years due to stiff competition. Those were album tracks though (6 Inch and Brown Skin Girl)
Brat is having it’s biggest sales week this week.

BSG competed in R&B

oops I mixed up two songs. I think it was Already that competed in BPD/GP. I just remember predicting Beyoncé in that category and getting it wrong.
