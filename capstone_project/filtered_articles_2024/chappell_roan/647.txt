From Sabrina Carpenter's alien makeout to Taylor Swift's shoutout to Travis Kelce
The MTV Video Music Awards are back—and crazier than ever.
The 2024 VMAs returned this year to the UBS Arena in New York. Megan Thee Stallion took to the stage as tonight's host, welcoming to the stage a bevy of stars and nominees that included the likes of Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Karol G, Anitta, Halsey, Eminem, and Camila Cabello. Katy Perry also took to the stage to receive this year's Video Vanguard Award. Other A-listers also attended the festivities, with a starry presenters list that featured Paris Hilton, Tinashe, Halle Bailey, and Suki Waterhouse.
Megan previously teased her plans for the show during an interview with People. “I’m excited to change clothes 500 times. I’m excited to perform. I’m excited to see all the Hotties,” the rapper told the outlet. “I love New York, I can’t wait to be there again and eat all the food, and I’m excited for people to see what I bring to the table while hosting.”
Naturally, X (or the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) went wild for the event. Ahead, we tracked the 34 best reactions to the 2024 VMAs.
