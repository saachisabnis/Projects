Sure, MTV VMAs and Grammy nominations are nice, but Chappell Roan isn’t likely to get a more unique honor in 2024 than being named Joy Rebel of the Year.
The title was given to the “Hot to Go!” singer by It Gets Better, a nonprofit organization that works to uplift, empower and connect LGBTQ+ youth around the globe. The organization’s current Joy Rebellion campaign highlights the community’s “resilience and defiance” in the face of “escalating attacks on their rights and identities.”
The honor came about when 10 LGBTQ+ young people from across the U.S. got together in LA for the second annual It Gets Better Youth Voices summit and were told about the campaign. When asked individually what brings them joy, six of them said Chappell. That led to them writing an article about what she means to them, and subsequently asking if they could name her their Joy Rebel of the Year.
They wrote in the article, “Chappell Roan represents a world where queer identities can be loud and proud, even in places that don’t always feel welcoming. She shows us queer joy is universal, uniting us through shared experiences.”
“She makes us feel less alone and that anything is possible, no matter where we’re from, and that’s a rare and beautiful gift.”
