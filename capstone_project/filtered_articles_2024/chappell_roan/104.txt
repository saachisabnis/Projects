After major backlash, Plane Jane deleted the tweet and released a statement
RuPaul’s Drag Race season 16 finalist Plane Jane has received huge backlash online for a now deleted tweet where she made disparaging comments about pop singer Chappell Roan. After being called out for it, Plane Jane made a statement addressing fans after removing the initial tweet.

In a now deleted post, Plane Jane wrote “Will I get tomatoes thrown at me if I say Chappell Roan’s love for drag feels performative as fuck? No shade queen secure the bag! I’m all for artists platforming and celebrating drag! Just a skeptic being skeptical.”
The comments from Plane Jane come after a huge rise in fame for Chappell Roan this year after her single Good Luck Babe became her first bonafide hit. Chappell Roan has a huge reverence for drag and nearly always performs in full drag herself, with every show on her tour having a different theme. She also platforms drag queens and books them as openers for her shows – something she has received a huge amount of love for from fans and the working drag community, and has established herself early on as a queer icon.
After Drag Race fans called out Plane Jane for her comments towards Chappell Roan, Plane deleted the tweet. She later wrote on Twitter / X again, addressing the backlash.

In a notes app picture posted to her Twitter / X, Plane explained “It’s funny how whenever I seem to step out of line with some of these ‘fans’ they immediately double down on calling me a man. I don’t particularly take offence to that because, hey, drag comes off, but something about it in this context seems disrespectful as shit – particularly because of how hypocritical it is.
“Of course the first people to do so are the same people who correct others when they use ‘he’ pronouns for drag queens, or call drag queens by their government names or even want people to be respectful of how they themselves identify. By all means keep calling me a man, f*g, whatever to fuel your little online arguments. Just know that you don’t fucking know me like that boo, and you’ll never have the pleasure to.”
"Chappell's support for drag seems performative" out of nowhere then you're mad that people are devaluing your art?  The irony is right there babes 🤍
