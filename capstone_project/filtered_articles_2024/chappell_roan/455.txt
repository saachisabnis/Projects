Fashion at Austin City Limits Music Festival didn't leave us pining for more.
While many festival attendees opted for comfy sneakers, breathable fabrics, and hydration backpacks, there was a juxtaposing assortment of form-fitting denim and western wear and loose, transparent dresses despite the blistering temperatures and relentless sun.
An on-stage artist remarked there was a lot of sweaty underwear underneath the banana costumes of one dedicated bunch. (I wish I hadn't heard that.)
Trendy accessories, namely small, squared shades, were all the rage among packs of Gen-Zers (and some Millennials endeavoring a three-day festival on an increasingly weary body), though I question whether their intention was to protect eyes or be the final touch in a look.
Combined with paisley bandanas, they harkened back to a time of low-rise jeans and flip phones. It was nostalgia at its most basic, contrasting with an increasingly commercialized music festival vying for the future and your wallet.
On Sunday, a vast herd of 'Pink Pony' girls (and boys) flocked to Zilker Park, waiting for their chance to catch a glimpse of their sovereign, Chappell Roan. To an uninformed onlooker (and let's be real, how could you be?) the colorways of hot pink, rhinestones, and ornate cowboy hats might have been confused for residual Barbie-mania, but to anyone in the know, they were patently Roan fans.
Some devotees even peppered themselves with bright orange stickers that simply said "HOT," referencing her hit song "HOT TO GO!"
Even those dressed in a simple tee and shorts transformed into a Chappell Roan groupie at 6:45 p.m. in front of the American Express stage: we all knew the lyrics and were at least familiar with the "HOT TO GO!" dance, though perhaps not some of men dragged there by their exuberant girlfriends. Good luck, babe!
