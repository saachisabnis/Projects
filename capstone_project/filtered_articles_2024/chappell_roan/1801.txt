Free pickMega Pupusa at Fiesta DCSat., 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Pennsylvania Ave. between 7th and 3rd streets NW🔗 Details
D.C. has a huge Salvadorian population who have helped fuel the District’s love for pupusas  – you know, those delicious pockets of corn dough typically stuffed with cheese and pork.
This weekend, the District will try to cement its pupusa scene in the Guinness World Records book by becoming home to the world’s largest pupusa.
A 20-foot wide pupusa is the goal of a team of chefs, including Iris Veronica Jimenez from La Casita Pupuseria, who are set to start cooking on Constitution Avenue at 11 a.m. Saturday. They’re trying to beat an 18-foot pupusa that required a team of 40 chefs in El Salvador to use 500 pounds of flour.
The Mega Pupusa party is part of this weekend’s Fiesta DC, a celebration of the city’s Hispanic communities. This year, the “host country” is Nicaragua.
The free festival includes live music, dance, food, a Miss Fiesta DC competition and a parade on Sunday.
Check out Fiesta DC from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. It will be along Pennsylvania Avenue between 7th and 3rd streets NW.
