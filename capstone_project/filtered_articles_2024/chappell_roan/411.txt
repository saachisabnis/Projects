Fans arrive at Westfair Amphitheater in Council Bluffs for Chappell Roan's final performance of "The Midwest Princess Tour" on Thursday. 
COUNCIL BLUFFS — Chappell Roan’s “Midwest Princess Tour” brought a flood of glitter, cowboy hats and catchy pop anthems to Council Bluffs on Thursday.
Thousands of fans flocked to Westfair Amphitheatre for Roan’s performance. Roan, a 26-year-old from Willard, Missouri, has risen to the top of the pop charts this year, with hits including “HOT TO GO!” and “Good Luck, Babe!”
By midafternoon, Westfair’s parking lots were quickly filling up as eager fans wanted to make sure they secured a parking spot. While the main gates weren’t scheduled to open until 5 p.m., fans could enter a vendor market starting at 2 p.m.
Some attendees wore red and black outfits that coordinated with the night’s theme of “My Kink is Karma,” named for a song on Roan’s most recent album. Roan typically announces different themes for her tour stops on social media.
Erica Adams of Omaha opted for a sparkly pink outfit with matching makeup and pink pony earrings, a nod to Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” hit. Adams said she enjoys Roan’s songs and her presence on social media.
“She’s just iconic,” she said. “I love everything that she does.”
Maitland Thomas of Lincoln said she sees Roan as a modern-day Cyndi Lauper and appreciates Roan’s commitment to doing shows in smaller Midwest cities that other artists often pass by.
“It’s also nice to have Midwest representation,” Thomas said. “I love it.”
Roan’s stop in the Omaha area followed recent shows in Franklin, Tennessee, and Rogers, Arkansas. While Roan has been on tour since September 2023, she canceled her performances at last weekend’s All Things Go Music Festival after openly sharing about her mental health struggles.
Some fans said they were worried Roan might cancel the Council Bluffs show.
“We would have been sad, but we would have respected it,” Emily Courtney of Omaha said.

In addition to loving Roan’s music, Courtney said, she appreciates her advocacy for the LGBTQ community.
Roan, who identifies as a queer woman, is donating $1 from each ticket sold for the “Midwest Princess Tour” to the GLO Center, an organization based in Springfield, Missouri, that provides resources, support and advocacy to the LGBTQ community.
“I love that an LGBTQ pop star is so huge right now,” Courtney said.
Some fans had difficulty purchasing tickets for the show, which sold out in less than a minute in July.
Courtney said she and her friends bought resale tickets but were struggling to access the tickets online before the show.
“We’re gonna get in there somehow,” she said.
