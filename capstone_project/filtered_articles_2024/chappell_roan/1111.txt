"Men mocking a woman who set clear boundaries to be safe because her family was stalked, she was sexually assaulted, and severely harassed. They can fuck all the way off"
A Saturday Night Live sketch using internet sensation Moo Deng as a parody of Chappell Roan is being widely criticised on social media.
Roan has made the headlines numerous times in the last few weeks. Earlier this month, the pop singer revealed she’d been diagnosed with “severe depression”, attributing her sudden rise to fame and the subsequent drastic changes to her life as the cause of her symptoms.
Prior to that, in August she took to TikTok to share her thoughts on “weird” and “creepy” followers, and called out the “predatory behaviour” of so-called “superfans” that includes “nonconsensual physical and social interactions”.
Roan last week experienced backlash by sharing that she was choosing not to back Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, arguing that there are “problems on both sides”.  She later expanded on her comments with a TikTok post, prefacing the video by saying that she has “encouraged people to use critical thinking skills” to “learn about what they’re voting for” and “ask questions”. After further backlash against her comments, she went on to clarify her election stance, saying: “I’m voting for fucking Kamala but I’m not settling for what has been offered. Because that’s questionable. It’s questionable, the actions of our government, of the internet, of you and me.”
She announced earlier this week that she was pulling out of All Things Go Festival in New York City and Washington, D.C, to prioritise her health.
Now, a sketch in which SNL cast member Bowen Yang dresses up as the pygmy hippo Moo Deng – who has recently gone viral – and speaks in a manner echoing Roan’s statements about fame has been receiving backlash.
“For the past ten weeks, I’ve been going non-stop, running around, eating lettuce, trying to bite the water from a hose,” he said. “And the response has been overwhelming but it has come to the point where I need to set some boundaries.
“Reminder – women owe you nothing. When I’m in my enclosure, tripping over stuff, biting my trainer’s knee, I am at work. That is the project. Do not yell my name, or expect a photo just because I’m your parasocial bestie, but because you appreciate my talent.”
“Before me the only hippos in media were Hungry Hungry and Jada Pinkett-Smith in Madagascar. But now, I’m your favourite hippo’s favourite hippo.”

Many online have called out SNL for what they perceive to be insensitivity towards how Roan has handled her rapid rise to fame.
“i honestly feel so bad for chappell roan because literally all she said was “please treat me like a human being” and everyone is making fun of her constantly for that,” one X/Twitter user said.
Another said: “Hey, guys, you know that young pop star who’s spent the last week being harassed, abused, attacked and threatened by lunatics for having some issues with the Democratic Party? Let’s kick her when she’s down. That’ll be fucking hilarious.”
A third said: “Men mocking a woman who set clear boundaries to be safe because her family was stalked, she was sexually assaulted, and severely harassed. They can fuck all the way off. Women don’t owe you sht.”

Not to be the boring police but can someone explain what is funny about a young woman being stalked, sexually harassed, and violently bullied online? Quickly. https://t.co/8kG6ynIMDN

Others pointed out that the sentiment didn’t land well when Roan is scheduled to appear on the show as a musical guest in November.
In other news, Lily Allen recently praised Roan for “changing the landscape” around fan behaviour and personal boundaries for artists.
Allen said it was “really amazing that she knows herself and knows her boundaries and is happy to articulate that” at the beginning of her career, despite the backlash she might receive.
“It’s kind of amazing to come out the gates and be like, ‘No, this is not gonna happen with me. I don’t care if I lose it all’.”
