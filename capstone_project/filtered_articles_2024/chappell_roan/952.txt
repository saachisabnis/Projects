"She’s very supportive of me and knows who I am as a person"
Sabrina Carpenter has revealed that advice that Taylor Swift has shared with her on handling fame and pressure.
Carpenter recently appeared on CBS’ Sunday Morning show, where she was asked about the pressure she’s faced following her meteoric rise to fame over the past year, and if Taylor Swift – who she opened for several times on the Eras Tour – had any advice to share.
The ‘Espresso’ singer-songwriter began: “You just watch her, like, walk in a room and it’s very easy to understand that she’s so composed, she’s graceful, she’s gracious.” As for actual advice, Carpenter added: “I wouldn’t say it’s, like, a verbal thing as much as just, like, she’s very supportive of me and knows who I am as a person and is very supportive of that. So I’m grateful for that.”
Sabrina Carpenter reflects on Taylor Swift's influence, noting her composure and support, and reflects on surrounding yourself with supportive people while navigating fame: "You kind of just figure it out along the way. https://t.co/sGO4dlvPXm pic.twitter.com/B2W32orJr5

She continued: “I think, again, if we’re talking about how to deal with it all, I think everyone has such an individual, unique experience that there’s no kind of blanket statement or advice on how to not let it rattle you. You just kind of have to exist and figure out what you can handle and what you don’t want to deal with.”
“You just kind of figure it out along the way. I know that sounds a little vague but I really do think that you find the people that you surround yourself with that make you feel safe and go from there,” she added.
Over the last year, two pop singers have rose to global superstardom – Carpenter and Chappell Roan. The latter has recently been vocal about the struggles she’s faced with the sudden overwhelming fame, going as far as revealing earlier this month that she’d been diagnosed with “severe depression”, attributing her sudden rise to fame and the subsequent drastic changes to her life as the cause of her symptoms.

Prior to that, in August Chappell Roan took to TikTok to share her thoughts on “weird” and “creepy” followers, and called out the “predatory behaviour” of so-called “superfans” that includes “nonconsensual physical and social interactions”.
Carpenter recently released ‘Short N’ Sweet’, which NME rated four stars: “Her individuality occasionally feels a little diluted, the likes of ‘Good Graces’ and ‘Bed Chem’ moulded in Ariana Grande’s image. For the most part, though, who Sabrina Carpenter is has never been clearer – and her long-awaited, hard-earned climb to pop’s summit should continue with ease.”
The singer recently announced UK and European tour dates, which will take place next year with former NME Cover star Rachel Chinouriri as a special guest. The shows kick off with at 3Arena in Dublin on March 3, with further shows in Birmingham, London and Manchester – see all dates below and grab tickets here.
