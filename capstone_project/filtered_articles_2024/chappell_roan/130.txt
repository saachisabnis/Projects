#VSFashionShow returns… Megan Thee Stallion does couple’s challenge… Baby Bieber’s birthday accidentally revealed… Chappell Roan cancels Paris & Amsterdam shows… and Nikki Glaser to host 2025 Golden Globes
Victoria’s Secret posted a fun little Instagram video showing a mystery woman strutting to the front desk of a hotel, and then Gigi Hadid bops around the corner, strutting her stuff with her sassy bob and sexy silver minidress. Gigi rings the bell a couple times before the woman sorting mail behind the desk turns around and reveals herself to be THE Tyra Banks, complete with a wind machine. Cue Chappell Roan’s Femininomenon as Tyra hands Gigi a gold envelope with her invitation to the upcoming Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in NYC on Oct. 15. Tyra said, “See ya there” before exiting stage right. A starstruck Gigi mouths, “Thank you” and “I love you” as she walks away. Tyra’s walked in 9 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows, but it’s been 19 years since she walked her last one. This will be Gigi’s fourth time on this particular runway. Victoria’s Secret started these shows in 1995, but it was canceled in 2019 after being criticized for promoting unhealthy body goals and lack of inclusion. But they fixed it! They had a Prime Video called Victoria’s Secret: The Tour ’23, but this next one will be a full-blown catwalk.

In “celebrities in love” news, Megan Thee Stallion shared a little clip of herself doing a couple’s challenge with Torrey Craig, who is apparently a small forward for the Chicago Bulls as well as Megan’s boyfriend! Megan and Craig are posted up in bed close their eyes while being asked questions about their relationship and then they point to whichever one of them they believe is the correct answer.  When asked, “Who’s the most likely to be arrested?  Who’s the better kisser? Who starts the most arguments? Who needs the most attention? Who’s the better cook? and Who has the better style?,” Megan got all the pointy fingers. But when asked, “Who said ‘I love you’ first?” they pointed at each other. But here’s the cliffhanger nobody’s talking about, they cut the video right after being asked, “Whose mother-in-law likes them more?” And Bravo fans may — or may not be! — surprised to learn that after only 9 months of meeting and dating each other, Alexis “Jesus Jugs” Bellino and John “Johnny J” Janssen are engaged. And someone needs to check on Shannon Storms Beador.

Last Friday, which was Aug. 23, Justin Bieber announced on his Instagram that his baby Jack Blues Bieber had arrived. The post has gotten over 21M likes, and Khloe Kardashian’s congratulations comment on the post has gotten over 79K! Well, yesterday, British model Adwoah Aboah posted that she delivered her baby girl — Shy Trinity Afua Wheatley — by emergency C-section on Aug. 23. Her good friend Hailey Bieber commented, “baby Shy!!!!” to which Adwoah replied, “a day apart” with 3 broken heart and 3 baby chick emojis. And with that, Adwoa accidentally revealed that Jack Blues was born on Aug. 22, and shares a birthday with Kidd Kraddick!

Chappell Roan hopped on X yesterday to announce, “Due to scheduling conflicts, I have had to make the extremely hard decision to cancel my Paris and Amsterdam shows. I have rescheduled my Berlin show to 23 September. I am so sorry & very disappointed 🙁 I promise I will be back. I’m heartbroken [broken heart emoji] thank you for understanding.” She followed that up with, “Ticket holders for Paris and Amsterdam—refund will come from point of purchase. Berlin, your tickets will be automatically transferred over to the new date.” The backlash was quick and harsh, because the “scheduling conflicts” are the VMAs. In addition to the vile names she’s being called, Chappell’s fans are furious because many of them bought plane tickets and booked hotel rooms for these shows, which aren’t happening now.

We’re a little over 3 months away from the Golden Globes, which will air live on CBS on Jan. 5, 2025. Not surprisingly, Jo Koy has not been asked back as host. Also not surprisingly, Nikki Glaser has! Her star is still shining bright from the Tom Brady roast earlier this year, making Nikki the perfect choice to host the Globes. In a statement, Nikki said she’s especially excited because “It’s one of the few times that show business not only allows, but encourages itself to be lovingly mocked (at least I hope so). (God I hope so).” She added, “Some of my favorite jokes of all time have come from past Golden Globes opening monologues when Tina, Amy, or Ricky have said exactly what we all didn’t know we desperately needed to hear. I just hope to continue in that time honored tradition (that might also get me canceled).”
Nikki Glaser is set to host the upcoming 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards.The awards show telecast will take place on Jan. 5, 2025. https://t.co/Aws6vDOClv pic.twitter.com/MMpuGAstft
