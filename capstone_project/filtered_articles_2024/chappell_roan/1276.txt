Hinterland Music Festival is over and I'm ready (and hot) to go. 
The three-day festival in Saint Charles, Iowa, wrapped up on Sunday with its most-stacked lineup of performers. 
The full list of acts on Sunday included: Odie Leigh, Katy Kirby, Flipturn, The Japanese House, Chappell Roan, Ethel Cain, Mt. Joy, Noah Kahan and Jeremie Albino. Alt-rock band Palehound was scheduled to open the day but cancelled due to travel issues.

Seeing Kahan as a headlining act was surreal on its own. His rise to stardom has been one of the swiftest in recent memory. Less than three years ago, I saw Kahan play a 500-cap bar in Phoenix. On Sunday, he played songs from "Stick Season" to a crowd of comfortably over 10,000, singing with some of the loudest voices Hinterland heard all weekend.
Kahan's stage comedy was the highlight of the set, though. He took a song request from a fan with a birthday, and also donned a homemade flag around his shoulders for a good chunk of the 90-minute performance. 
Still, Kahan was arguably not even the main event of the day on Sunday. That was obvious from the ocean of ornate pink tops, cowboy hats, feathers and fans in the crowd. Kahan knew the honorary headliner played earlier than he did. 
“You don’t have any idea how hard it is to headline after Chappell Roan," he joked. 
Here are some of the bests and worsts of Hinterland's final day.

The hype surrounding Chappell Roan's set started with the release of absurd videos from the rising popstar's Thursday Lollapalooza set, which Lolla told CNN was the largest daytime turn-out in the festival's history. Then there was the instant sell-out of Roan apparel at the Hinterland merch tent on Sunday. 
Three minutes after 5:15 p.m., when Roan was scheduled to go on stage but hadn't quite arrived yet, the sea of pink-clad fans was storming. They did the wave. They chanted her name.
And then, the Missouri-raised self-dubbed Midwest Princess arrived, and instantly proved all of the hype worthy. Roan opened with lightning pop hit "Femininomenon," dressed in a nun's outfit because, she later shared, it was appropriate for a Sunday.

The "Femininomenon" performance was one of the best live songs I've ever seen, worthy of sparking full-body chills on the explosive hooks and exorcistic bridges. Roan's stellar choreography and campy visuals came to life on "After Midnight" and "Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl." 
"HOT TO GO" was arguably Hinterland's Best Moment. The star's biggest hit has a "YMCA"-style dance that she walked the crowd through. But it wasn't necessary. Everyone knew it. There are very few festival acts in the world right now where you'll see that kind of synchronization. 
Many have dubbed Roan the next in line for pop royalty, and this set proved all of it to be true. It'll be astonishing, as soon as a year from now, that she performed this caliber of a setlist in a pre-sunset slot at all.
I was one who groaned about Roan not getting a higher booking, but the shortened set time incidentally worked in Roan's favor. It gave her zero room for filler.

The 45-minute show delivered hit after hit after hit: flawless ballad "Casual"; sonic short-film "Red Wine Supernova"; vengeance anthem for the ages "My Kink Is Karma"; and most recent breakout "Good Luck Babe," which verified Roan's goosebump-inducing vocal vigor on its final hook. 
Chappell Roan has been everywhere. The "Pink Pony Club" of West Hollywood. The bedrooms of New York City in "Naked in Manhattan." Lollapalooza. The top of the pop charts. 
But for a moment in the Iowa sun, the Midwest Princess came home and got Hinterland hot like Papa John. We should all be grateful.

There's a meme online about two houses in Santa Monica right next to each other. One is pink, purple and built like a Barbie Dream House. The other is a deep, ominous black.
Hearing gothic-Americana genius Ethel Cain take the stage right after Chappell Roan felt like making plans to go to a party at both houses in the same day. 
It was still perfect. Cain pulled out the harmonica for country-epic "Thoroughfare," gave fans two unreleased tracks in "Punish" and "Dust Bowl," and ended her set with the most energetic track of all: breakout indie-pop single "American Teenager," which got huge whoops from the fans who sat still through Cain's first seven, slower songs. 
Another positive: Cain's bassist, Iowa native Kaylee Stenberg, rocked a Caitlin Clark Hawkeye jersey for the set.

With how hot the temperatures were Sunday, the songs in the afternoon felt a little too perfectly titled.
The it's like 199 degrees lyric on Chappell Roan's "HOT TO GO" sounded like a statement of fact, and not a sensual plea. On "August," Florida indie-rockers Flipturn turned up the heat, and lead singer Dillon Basse's voice crackled with a humidity reminiscent of fellow Jacksonville natives Lynyrd Skynyrd. The Japanese House lead singer Amber Bain joked that she should bleep out the title lyric in "Sunshine Baby."

I talked about the heat on Friday, but it's worth talking about again. Sunday's high temperatures were the worst of the entire weekend. During The Japanese House's peak-heat afternoon set, two people fainted. 
"I’m so sorry. I respect every last one of you for bearing with (the heat)," Bain said.
Behind her banter, you could see a layer of true anger that fans had to sit in the oven. She told fans not to dance and save their energy instead. 
“You guys shouldn’t be fainting in the f*****g boiling sun," Bain said. 
Festivalgoers wait in line to refill their water bottles at Hinterland Music Festival on Sunday, August 4, in St. Charles, Iowa. On the first day, people waited in line for 30 to 45 minutes, with at least one person cited of passing out from the heat.
The Hinterland staff handed out cases of water to fans and even shared cups of ice early in the day, too. But it seemed like they were always two steps behind. The ice gesture quickly escalated from free ice, to $0.50 ice, to $1 ice, to, finally, you cannot buy ice because we are running out.
After a whole day of sitting in the heat, I needed a break before Noah Kahan's set. So I slipped into the sensory-friendly room, a small space tucked discretely in the food court area. 
The room had low lighting, sweet fragrances and absolutely zero noise. It also had stand-up fans that kept the place cool. A series of tables were topped with Hinterland-themed coloring and puzzle books, and the room also had mats on the floor with pillows to rest on. 
I watched most of Mt. Joy's penultimate Sunday set from that spot, with noise-cancelling headphones on pumping in a low-volume sound. This rejuvenation gave me the energy necessary to finish the weekend with my head high. More festivals should have places like this. 
Lines at a music festival are to be expected. Complaining about them is almost a redundancy. But the lines at the Hinterland entrance on Sunday were wicked. General admission fans who got in line around the time doors opened at 11 a.m. waited roughly two hours to get in. Most missed first act Odie Leigh.

The heat made it even worse. The Hinterland crew did, thankfully, hand out free cans of cold water at various stops along the general admission line. But more entrance points were clearly needed. 
The structural issues weren't just a Sunday issue. On Friday night, some fans waited for the complimentary shuttle back to Des Moines until almost 2 a.m., three hours after the fest ended. 
I've been to six different large-scale music festivals, as a journalist and as a fan, and none of them were convenient to get to or from. But Hinterland's line efficiency would rank near the bottom of the list.
Because of the heat, it took a village to make sure everyone stayed safe and sane this weekend. As much as I was frequently discouraged by the festival's organization, I was heartened by the kindness of the staff and attendees.

Sometimes, concerts can bring the worst out of folks. They can get rowdy, frustrated or outright cruel toward their fellow fans. But I didn't see that at all this weekend. 
Whenever a fan fainted due to the excessive heat, at least two dozen hands immediately thrust into the air, waving down medical staff for a swift response.
The bartenders, hamstrung by ice restrictions and the heat in their own tent, found a way to help, too. They filled up super-soaker squirt guns with ice-cold water and shot at anybody who requested while passing by. Those arctic blasts helped immensely.

As the campgrounds dispersed on Sunday night and Monday morning, I watched many campers help their fellow Hinterlanders pack up tents and carry heavy objects to vehicles. 
It was little gestures like these all weekend that proved that concerts don't have to be spaces for hooliganism, but instead, they can be a healing slice of humanity.
That's the second best thing Hinterland gave me this weekend. After "Femininomenon," of course.
