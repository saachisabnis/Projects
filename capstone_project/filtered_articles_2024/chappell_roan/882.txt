The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess earned 105,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending Sept. 26 (up 64%) according to Luminate, marking its biggest week yet by units earned.* Traditional album sales comprise a career weekly-best 56,000 (up 328%). Vinyl sales were red-hot for the set, with 50,000 sold (up 548%), easily Roan’s best week on vinyl and the sixth-largest week for any vinyl album in 2024.

	The week-over-week growth is owed to the release of four new vinyl variants and a cassette tape in celebration of the album’s first anniversary on Sept. 22.

	The set also returns to No. 1 on the Indie Store Album Sales chart (up one spot), for a seventh nonconsecutive frame, continuing as the title with the most weeks atop the ranking in 2024. The album sold 15,500 copies at independent record stores – the second-biggest week for any album in the indie sector this year. Only Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department had a bigger week with indies in 2024, when it sold 17,000 copies in its opening week.

Midwest Princess’ total year-to-date sales now rise to 248,000 sold, making it the 10th-biggest selling album of 2024. The Tortured Poets Department has a runaway lead as the year’s top-seller, with 2.77 million. Her 2024 vinyl sales climb to 167,000 – the third-biggest selling vinyl title of the year thus far. Poets is also the top-selling vinyl album of 2024, with 1.03 million.

	* Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.
