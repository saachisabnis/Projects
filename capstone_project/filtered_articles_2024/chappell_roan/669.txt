‘I catch myself looking around and I shouldn’t – I’m not Chappell’
Chappell Roan has been the top of the list of talking points for the past week. Not just because Chappell is reaching stratospheric new heights of fame and commercial success as the world wakes up to her slept on talent, but because Roan has been very emphatic talking about how much she finds it weird and hard to adjust to the levels of fame due to fans overstepping the mark when it comes to approaching her in public. She’s not the only one in LA struggling with it, because an uncanny Chappell Roan lookalike has supported her aesthetic twin saying that she too is getting harrased and stalked by fans who think that she is Chappell. It’s wild.

The TikTokker lookalike, who posts as wet.hair.brush on the app and has ‘Chappell Roan’s evil twin’ in her bio, has gone viral on Reddit after a lengthy five minute video was posted there showing her supporting Chappell Roan in the wake of the divisive and wordy posts from the popstar.
The TikTok lookalike explains “I wanna talk about the controversy going around Chappell’s post. As somebody who looks a lot like her, who also lives in Los Angeles, I’ve had a few stalker / fan experiences of my own. I’m just hoping by making this video it can open a lot of your guys’ minds and eyes as to why she’s setting this boundary.
“I have these experiences with the fans when I have straight hair, when I have sunglasses – I still look like her.” She then explains how she was in Target once on her own, and a girl came over to her to compliment her jeans. The girl then grabs her hand and makes small talk that made her uncomfortable before eventually asking if the lookalike was actually Chappell Roan, as a group of fans waited down the aisle.
The lookalike explains “She touched me. Randomly. She grabbed my hand without me saying any consent. She stood there, this interaction was like five minutes, it was too long an interaction with somebody I don’t know. She stood there and all her friends were watching.
“I left feeling disturbed. I thought about it for a few days. I did not get good vibes from that girl, either. It was just unsettling and weird. Situations happen like that often. I haven’t been touched like that or grabbed since, but Target, Trader Joe’s, farmer’s market, restaurant, movie theatre – you name it, it happens. But the point is – it’s scary. I catch myself looking aorund and I shouldn’t, I’m not Chappell.
“I feel a little caught off guard in some situations. I cannot imagine actually being her.”
