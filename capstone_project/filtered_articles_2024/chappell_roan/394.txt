MTVs Video Music Awards returned for their 40th year on Wednesday, September 11. The televised event had been originally scheduled for Tuesday, September 10, but delayed the date to not conflict with the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
Many celebrities were in attendance at the annual award show, including Taylor Swift who won seven awards throughout the night including “Video of the Year” and “Artist of the Year.” Swift became the first person to win “Artist of the Year” multiple times in VMA history. The award was first introduced in 2017 and awarded to Ed Sheeran.
But that’s not the only status Swift achieved, her seven wins put her career total to 30, tying her with Beyoncé’s record. The two now both hold the title of most-awarded artist in VMA history. Beyoncé has won 26 VMAs as a solo artist, the other four wins come from her time with Destiny’s Child and as The Carters with her husband Jay-Z.
