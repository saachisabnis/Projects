"I'm delighted 'Carpool Karaoke' is back to celebrate the holidays in true style," said creator and executive producer James Corden. "I've entrusted Apple Music's very own, the brilliant Zane Lowe, to drive our superstars to work and reminded him it's so important to keep his eyes open while he sings. We can't wait for everyone to see it."

"This was hands-down the most fun I have ever had in a car," said Apple Music's Zane Lowe. "I'm very grateful to James for trusting me behind the wheel of a very expensive car with three of music's most exciting artists, and I'm honored to be part of bringing this special 'A Carpool Karaoke Christmas' to fans all over the world."
