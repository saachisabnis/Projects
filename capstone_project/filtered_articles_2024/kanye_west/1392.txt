Bu Thiam, manager and brother of Global superstar Akon, and 4Batz recently joined Gillie and Wallo on the Million Dollaz Worth of Game Podcast to share insights from their extensive careers in the music industry. 
Thiam, a seasoned music executive and brother of multi-platinum artist Akon, reflected on the impact of JAY-Z’s 2009 track, “Death of Auto-Tune,” and its implications for T-Pain and the broader industry.
During the conversation, Thiam discussed the era when T-Pain’s innovative use of auto-tune redefined the music landscape. The Florida artist’s groundbreaking approach not only dominated the charts but also influenced major acts like Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Future, who incorporated the effect into their most memorable hits. 
Reflecting on the song’s release, Thiam remarked, “At the time, one of the biggest had a song called ‘Death of Auto-Tune,’ and it really hurt him. It hurt his career in a sense. When you think 10 years later, you see what he’s been able to do and what he created—T-Pain doesn’t get, to this day, enough respect.” 
He further emphasized the need for the music industry to allow new ideas to grow and evolve instead of dictating rigid standards.
Thiam even suggested that JAY-Z might owe T-Pain an apology for casting a negative shadow over auto-tune despite previously admiring T-Pain’s artistry. While JAY-Z’s critique was aimed more at rappers misusing the technique, the fallout had unintended consequences for T-Pain’s career.
Fans offered mixed reactions to Thiam’s comments, with one noting, “JAY-Z was talking about rappers; it had nothing to do with T-Pain. If he couldn’t read between the lines, that’s on him.” Another added, “The way people keep calling JAY-Z out, knowing he doesn’t care, is wild. When will they accept that?”
Despite the controversy, T-Pain remains a force in pop culture. His live streams attract thousands of viewers daily, and his collaborations with contemporary stars like GloRilla and EARTHGANG prove his influence remains strong more than 15 years after JAY-Z’s Blueprint 3 single debuted. Thiam, now managing emerging artists like Ian and 4Batz, built his career working with T-Pain, Lady Gaga, and Jeremih. 
As a former A&R executive at Def Jam and Columbia Records, he played a key role in shaping careers, including contributing to Kanye West’s iconic My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Thiam’s reflections underscore the enduring legacy of T-Pain’s artistry and the evolving conversation around innovation in music.
