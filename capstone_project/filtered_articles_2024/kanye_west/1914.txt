Anuel AA has made his position in the current presidential race clear with a full-throated endorsement of Donald Trump at a recent rally.
Anuel spoke his piece at an event in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on Friday (August 30). Trump introduced Anuel and fellow reggaeton star Justin Quiles as “two amazing Puerto Rican musical legends.”

“I don’t know if these people know who the hell you are,” Trump said of the rally crowd. “But it’s good for the Puerto Rican vote.”
“I’m from Puerto Rico,” Anuel began. “We’ve been going through a lot as a country. Biden always promised, promised. A lot of politicians promised through the years.”

He then called Trump “the best president the world has seen, this country has ever seen.”
“So, all my Puerto Ricans, let’s stay united. Let’s vote for Trump,” he continued.

“I personally spoke with him, he wants to help Puerto Rico grow and succeed as a country. He wants to keep helping Latinos in the U.S. Let’s keep doing things the right way and let’s make America great again.”

Trump may be using Anuel for the “Puerto Rican vote,” but he once had even bigger plans for Kanye West.
According to a former staffer, he wanted to use the superstar to help “unify” America during his presidency.

Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as the White House’s Director of Strategic Communications during Trump’s tenure in office, recalled the bizarre idea during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen earlier this summer.
After prefacing her story by describing it as “dark,” Griffin said: “One day, he wanted to have Kanye West come and do a church service on the White House lawn to unify the country.”

She then joked: “I can think of a few things less unifying than that,” referencing Ye’s penchant for controversy.
Needless to say, Trump’s plan didn’t materialize.

“We were like, ‘Not the time or place, sir,’” Griffin added while laughing.
