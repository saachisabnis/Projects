She promised it would happen, and now it seems as if  it has: Julia Fox just announced she is lesbian.
The reality-show panelist and cutting-edge fashionista posted the news on TikTok, stitched to a clip of user Em Grace (@emgwaciedawgie), who said, “I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It’s like, aww, you hate that man.”

Julia Fox’s new memoir, ‘Down the Drain,’ reveals a wild and sometimes tragic life in which Kanye was a blip — even as she works to take back control of it.
“Hey. That was me. I was that lesbian,” Fox said in her reply, shooting the video as she walked down a sunny street. “Sorry boys, won’t happen again.” 
Representatives for the “Uncut Gems” actor did not respond immediately Tuesday to a request for confirmation. But Fox had pointed toward the future of her sexuality in an interview last year. 
“I think I’m just so afraid to open that can of worms, because I know that once I do, that’s it,” Fox told The Times in September, about the decision to get into relationships with women instead of men. “There’s no coming back from it, and I know that I’ll just be a lesbian. It will happen, eventually. I’m just prolonging it, personally, because I’m afraid.”
She also wrote in her memoir about her feelings for a best friend, Gianna.

Ye, a.k.a. Kanye West, and Julia Fox have struck up an intriguing relationship, going on dates in Miami, New York and L.A. in the past two weeks.
“If I were to have been open with my sexuality, I would’ve been with Gianna,” Fox told The Times. “We were low-key in love. There were times when we would do sexual things, and then never talk about it.” 
The feelings apparently ran deep, prompting her to add, “If I could bring her back to life, I would trade everything apart from my son. Every dollar in my bank account, every achievement, every other person in my life. She died, and I was never the same again.”
Of course, outside of her NYC club reputation and her acting and “OMG Fashun” careers, Fox is well known for her brief, allegedly sexless stint on the arm of rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. 
The two hit the scene together for a couple of weeks in early 2021, traveling to Miami, New York City and L.A. and leaving heads spinning among those who follow such things.

Julia Fox is reportedly heartbroken after her younger brother’s arrest on drug and weapons charges. Police raided his luxury co-op Wednesday in New York City.
Since then, Fox had sworn off men — both in relationships and in general — telling Elle last year that her attitude was, “Like, don’t talk to me, don’t look at me, don’t bother me.”
She went on: “I feel like knowingly engaging in a heterosexual relationship, you are signing yourself up for an unhealthy dynamic.”
