Rapper Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori have once again ignited discourse on social media, this time over a public outing that many see as cringeworthy, calculated, and another unnecessary display of the young woman’s sex appeal.
A now-viral video shared by Royal Produxions on X on Sunday, Dec. 15, shows the couple  strolling together along a shopping strip.
29-year-old Censori wore a sheer cream-colored, barely-there jumpsuit with long sleeves, matched with open-toe heels, turning heads for all the wrong reasons. In contrast, the “Donda” chart-topper kept to his signature oversized style, rocking baggy sweatpants, sunglasses, and a black hoodie.
The 33-second clip, which was first posted on Instagram on Nov. 7, amassed over 8.8 million views within a day and left fans and critics alike questioning the two’s motivations for their odd appearance.
The original post’s caption was simple, “Kanye West and his scantily clad wife Bianca Censori walk up and down as they stage photos for the paparazzi.”
Social media users wasted no time sharing their opinions on the video, with a few people agreeing with the Royal Produxions account.
“Imagine living a life where you’re ridiculously wealthy and still have to put on a performance everywhere you go,” said one person.
“Imagine being this insecure, needing this much attention,” a second user bluntly noted.
One commenter added, “I don’t quite understand how or why he makes his wife wear such ridiculously humiliating outfits in public.

Most of the chatter centered on how Censori looked, as she’s known for wearing ultra-revealing outfits, with many railing on West for having his hand in her style choices.
While West’s motivations for his wife’s public persona remain a hot topic, some believe the rapper’s choices reflect deeper insecurities.
“Do you suppose Kanye West is a happy human being?” one critic asked, adding, “It seems odd to parade his wife scantily dressed out in public every few months. It’s winter for goodness sakes.”
One critic quipped, “I wanna read their marriage contract soo bad,” insinuating as many others have that she has to dress like this to be in the relationship.
The clip comes after speculation about cracks in their relationship hit the internet.
According to In Touch Weekly, Bianca may be rethinking their marriage due to West’s high-pressure, nomadic lifestyle.
“L.A. is where she wants to be. She loves it there but being halfway around the world was very lonely for her,” a close source reportedly revealed.
The couple’s recent purchase of a $35 million mansion in November 2024 could signal an attempt to squelch her concerns. However, critics believe the constant public scrutiny and Grammy winner’s instability may continue to strain their relationship.
Adding to the drama, the Chicago native’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, is reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation. According to RadarOnline, the billionaire reality star is threatening to limit Ye’s visitation with their four children if his wife continues dressing in a way she deems inappropriate.
“Kim has let Kanye know she’s going to try and withhold his visitation with the kids if Bianca is around dressed like a cheap tart,” an alleged insider claimed.

The same source alleged Kardashian believes Kanye is using Bianca to provoke her.
The tipster added, “Kim believes Kanye is exploiting his new wife to make Kim jealous. She’s even considering meeting with her look-alike replacement … to try to talk sense into her.”
Kanye and Kim, who were married for seven years, finalized their divorce in late 2022. A month later, he surprised everyone by tying the knot with his Yeezy architect, a move that has only intensified public interest in his private life.
As the video circulates, one thing remains clear: Kanye West and Bianca Censori’s headline-grabbing antics are far from over.
What’s unclear is if they care about the public’s opinion and are staging outings because of that, or they are just living their lives and don’t care who is watching.
