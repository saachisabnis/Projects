And now Bianca's father Leo Censori wants to sit down with his daughter's husband and have a word about how the young model has been dressing lately. According to reports, Leo has requested that his daughter's husband Kanye should fly out to Austraila to meet with him and have a conversation about the way in which Bianca has been stepping out.
The MailOnline reports: "Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react."
They added that Bianca's father "plans to have a sit down with Kanye", with the source noting that "Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye's power or control". They went on: "No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits."
This comes after Bianca was spotted out and about with her mother Alexandra in the States, after the glamorous mother-in-law of the rapper flew from Australia to America to see her daughter. Reports claim that Alexandra's trip had the intention behind it of "saving" Bianca, with her "failing" to get through to her and instead seen out and about while Bianca donned racy attire.
The insider continued to the outlet that Biancaâ€™s father "was not necessarily pleased with his wife's visit to see their daughter because he feels like she enabled Bianca to continue doing what she is doing".
