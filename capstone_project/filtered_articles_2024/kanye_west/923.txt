Ty Dolla $ign has explained why he had no problem joining forces with Kanye West on their recent project Vultures 1, despite the latter’s emergence as such a controversial figure.
In a new feature published by Billboard on Thursday (June 20), the California native made it clear that, for him, there was no hesitation about the decision.

“Ye is the best artist of this generation, besides me, and I don’t give a fuck about what people were talking about,” Ty Dolla $ign declared. “I know my n***a. He’s one of the best people I’ve ever met.”
He went on to add that he was never worried about whether or not the controversy surrounding Ye would impact the success of the album.

“Just with my analysis of how it goes with him, he goes all the way to the top,” the singer and producer explained. “And something may happen and he’ll say [something people find offensive] — and then people [get] right back, you know. Because this sh-t is undeniable.”
It may surprise some fans to learn that Dolla $ign also ran point on the creation of Vultures 1. The article details a process by which he would bring Yeezy songs that he had worked on alone or that the two had spent time on together; then they would deconstruct and reconstruct those sounds until they created the finished product which was delivered to fans on January 12.

The process took the two prolific artists across the globe, recording in Las Vegas, Miami, Los Angeles, Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. But they didn’t necessarily set up shop at studios across the world.
“Japan was hotel rooms, Italy was hotel rooms,” Ty recalled. “Then we got Sting to let us use his [Italian] villa,” Ty says. “At first we were just recording in the living room, recording by the pool, setting up recording equipment out there, and then we found out that there’s an actual recording studio there.”

The closest they came to actual studios — outside of Sting’s home in Italy — was when Kanye West took over a hotel building in Dubai, where he converted multiple rooms into recording spaces.
Apparently, Ye has just as much respect for his latest collaborator, based on what he said during an interview with Big Boi’s Neighborhood, which was re-shared within the Billboard article.

“Mike Dean was the kind of person that you can hand him something and he’ll hand you a finished product back,” the Chicago native said of his choice in project collaborators. “That’s how Ty is. You can give him something, even a murmur, and he’ll bring it back with the words, he can fix all the notes on it, he can bring in the drums, the music.”
In the same interview, the “Or Nah” singer offered Vultures fans plenty to be excited about, confirming that he and Kanye West have “all the songs” for Vultures 2 and confirming that the project is finally on the horizon after numerous delays.

“We got all the songs. Basically, it’s just like, ‘How can we get it there? How can we go bigger than the first album?,’” he explained.
He added: “Certain people will probably expect you to just do the same exact sound. But that sound’s already out.”

Ty Dolla $ign was also asked about circumventing streaming services for the new project.
“Why not? Switch it up,” he said. “[West has] always got something up his sleeve. I always got some[thing] up my sleeve.”

Earlier this month, Ty gave his first update on the status of the much-delayed project and teased further albums with Yeezy.
Appearing on a Kick stream with Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy over the weekend, he said: “It’s dropping ASAP. Vultures 2 is on the way. It’s coming soon. Any day now. It could be tomorrow.”

When asked by a fan on the stream whether Vultures 2 would be available on streaming platforms or just Kanye’s YZY app, Ty replied: “On the app.”
Elsewhere during his broadcast with the controversial Russian streamer, Ty Dolla $ign played a preview of an unreleased song from Vultures 2 that features a Playboi Carti verse.
