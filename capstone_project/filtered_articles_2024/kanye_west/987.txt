Kanye West got into an argument with a fan this week after they urged him to return to his roots and “be the old Ye.”
A fan named Tyg Savage took to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday (January 23) to share screenshots of a heated exchange he had with Ye after the rapper jumped into his direct messages.

Kanye was responding to Savage commenting “go back to Jesus Ye” on a recent video he posted on Instagram of his wife Bianca Censori.
“N-gga, you can’t tell me what to do on my page,” Ye fired back in the fan’s DMs. “Unfollow if you don’t like it.”

Savage responded: “I love your music and the old you. It has inspired me my friends and many other people out there in this world. Pls don’t change because people want to. Be the old Ye I used to love. Thanks.”
West replied by saying he sounded “insane” and told him to “go listen to the old Ye” if that’s the music he wants to hear.

“I’m a 46-year-old grown ass man. Go make some kids if you wanna have somebody you can tell what to do,” he added.
“Fuck you and every single person trying to tell me who I need to be, what I need to post, what I need to focus on, who I can vote on, what type of music I should make, what kind of clothes I should wear.”

He continued: “I ain’t no Kid Cudi. I ain’t Cudi, dawg. I am the realest, boy. Not Hov, not you. I ain’t Lupe Fiasco. I ain’t Mos Def, dawg. I am the one, boy. This is my fucking block. I am homeless 12 years, Ye. I ain’t listened since ’07. Not since Graduation.”
