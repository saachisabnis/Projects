The California crooner also confirmed that the album — which was supposed to arrive last Friday (May 3) — would not be available on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music.
When asked by a fan on the stream whether Vultures 2 would be available on streaming platforms or just Kanye’s YZY app, Ty replied: “On the app.”

Elsewhere during his broadcast with the controversial Russian streamer, Ty Dolla played a preview of an unreleased song from Vultures 2 that features a Playboi Carti verse.
He also confirmed that the duo are definitely releasing all three planned Vultures albums before hinting at a fourth.
“Possibly four, who knows,” he said while smoking a joint and commenting on how the albums keep getting delayed. “Shit happens.”

Kanye West had previously teased the idea of selling Vultures 2 directly to fans.
Messaging a fan account on Instagram, he said: “We sell albums on Yeezy.com. I got 20 million instagram followers,” he wrote in a text exchange. “When 5% of my followers buy an album [t]hat’s 1 million albums sold[.] That’s 300k more than the biggest album last year.

“We sold 1 million items on Yeezy.com on Super Bowl Sunday so we know it’s possible. How do you feel about us not streaming and only selling the album digitally[?]”
The initiative was supported by Ty Dolla $ign when he replied to a fan who wanted him to convince Ye to release the album in a conventional fashion.

The fan said: “Bro, don’t let Ye release the album on the website, you’d lose a lot more. and they will piracy the album and this will hinder you in an absurd way.”
Unconvinced by this argument, Ty responded with a six-paragraph message, beginning with: “That’s what these streaming services want u to to believe so they can stay on top. Music cost us money and time to make but they don’r want us to get paid for it.

“There selling the audience subscriptions and renting our music out while giving us a fraction of a penny [crying laughter emoji]. I hear what you’re saying but we’re already #1 with the first.”
He concluded: “It’s time to figure out the unlock on how to bring the music straight to our audience and cut the middle man out. Artists are getting raped and that has to stop.”
