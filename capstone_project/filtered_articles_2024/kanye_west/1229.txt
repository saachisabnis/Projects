J. Cole recently opened up about Kanye West’s impact on his career during the first episode of his Inevitable podcast.
The Dreamville founder shared how Kanye became his “favorite artist” and played a pivotal role in shaping his own artistic vision.
Cole explained, “Kanye kinda cracked my mind open. He was the first artist I saw myself in.” He went on to say that Kanye made it possible to talk about personal experiences in a way that was both relatable and appealing. “I didn’t know how to talk about my life. And then, f**king Kanye West happened.”
Reflecting on the moment that changed everything for him, Cole recalled, “When the ‘Through The Wire’ video dropped, that changed my life. Kanye was the first time I saw myself in somebody.”
Although Cole and West aren’t on the best of terms, that didn’t stop Cole from showing respect to West, even after Kanye dissed him.
Kanye West had some words for Cole on the “Like That” remix in April. “Play J Cole, get the p**sy dry,” he rapped. Play this sh*t back a hundred-thirty times.”
Further more, on The Download podcast, YE doubled down on his comments. “F*ck all that sh*t. Because, like that n**ga J Cole went on tour with Drake, he know what it is. You can’t put Cole and ‘up’ in the same sentence.” 
Kanye’s comments come after J. Cole apologized for dropping a diss track against Kendrick Lamar.
