Kanye West has been criticized by Charlamagne Tha God for taking more shots at Drake, both in his music and interviews.
Speaking on The Breakfast Club on Tuesday (April 23), Charlamagne hit out at the Chicago rap icon, saying: “Kanye West is the leader of the legion of lame. What a hating-ass human. What type of man sits around saying, ‘We were all energized by the elimination’ of another man?

“This man is so miserable and has never dealt with whatever hurt and pain he’s feeling that he just wants to project it onto other people. I don’t even want Kendrick to respond no more because on ‘Like That,’ he clowned Drake and Cole for cliquing up.”
He continued: “Don’t be a part of the legion of lame, Kendrick. Metro, what are you doing? All of y’all should be running from Kanye West. Have you not read The 48 Laws of Power? Avoid the unhappy and unlucky.

“Kanye done made the whole thing corny. It was entertaining until he brought his jealous, envious ass into the picture.”
The radio personality also revealed that Kanye edited out disparaging comments he made about Drake and Virgil Abloh in their 2018 interview.
“When I interviewed him back in the day, he was hating on Drake and Virgil then talking about how they took the culture from him,” he said. “And this was when he was up and he was still hating. He actually edited that part of the interview out when he was hating on Drake and Virgil.”
Kanye West reignited his long-simmering beef with Drake this past weekend when he released a remix of Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That,” which sparked the current tension in Hip Hop thanks to Kendrick Lamar’s blistering guest verse.
On the track, Ye sided with K. Dot by taking aim at Drizzy with lines like: “It’s a wrap for n-ggas/ Where’s Lucian? Serve your master, n-gga/ You caught a little bag for your masters, didn’t ya?/ Lifetime deal, I feel bad for n-ggas/ Y’all so outta sight, outta mind/ I can’t even think of a Drake line.”

He also jabbed J. Cole, who appeared to be the 6 God’s biggest ally before bowing out of the battle, by rapping: “Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry.”
The shots at Drake continued in Kanye’s appearance on Justin LaBoy’s The Download podcast, where he claimed that his rival’s raps “mean nothing” and he is guilty of inflating his streaming stats.

Dismissing Drizzy’s diss track “Push Ups,” West said: “Every bar that Drake said means nothing anymore. Drop and give me — I ain’t nobody gonna drop and do shit. Your raps don’t mean shit, n-gga.”
He added: “You take Drake and Lucian [Grainge, Universal Music Group CEO] out, that alters everything. That’s such a control thing they have, the algorithm, the way they work together to fix the numbers.”
