Kanye West‘s antisemitic commentary while on Candace Owens’ YouTube channel last month has resulted in the conservative political commentator being suspended and demonetized on the platform.
Owens revealed the news in a post to X on Monday (September 9), confirming she would not be posting any new shows this week due to a seven-day suspension.

“They also removed the interview as ‘hate speech.’ as it was mass reported by Zionists. Their tactics never change,” she said, sharing a screenshot of the email she received from the company.
The interview, published in August, found Ye saying  that “Jewish people control the media,” per the message from YouTube that Owens shared. And though it’s been up for over a month now, Owens believes it was only just recently flagged as a result of the debate she had with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach on Piers Morgan’s show last week.

“The world knows why I am being targeted and frankly, I have never felt more confident that I am the right person for this to happen,” she added on X.
“Thus far, I have had zero strikes on my @YouTubeCreators account,” she said, adding: “I have now been inundated with 3 back to back content hits within minutes, plus an email that I am now fully demonetized. We all know exactly who is behind this and why.”

In a statement to The New York Post,  YouTube confirmed her suspension.
“We’ve suspended channels associated with Candace Owens from the YouTube Partner Program following repeated violations of our policies, including our Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines and Community Guidelines,” YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said. YouTube also noted that Owens’ channels repeatedly violate the site’s policies, but that creators are allowed to reapply for access in 90 days.
All who watched that podcast know that Ye was calm, and filled with love—speaking about the world coming together to defeat evil. 
2.5 million people watched my debate with Rabbi Shmuley last week. The world knows why I am being targeted and frankly, I have never felt more…

Unlike Kanye West, Cardi B is not a fan of Candace Owens and recently took her to task over remarks she’d made about the murder of Sonya Massey at the hands of a police officer.
Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman from Springfield, Illinois, was shot and killed by an Illinois sheriff’s deputy at her home on July 6 after calling the police for help.

During an episode of her show shortly after, Owens spoke about the shooting and chocked it up to a mere mistake by the cops and condemned anyone who has said it was racially motivated.
“Police officers are human beings, there are mistakes that happen,” she said. “The idea that now you’re going to use this situation … To then try to make Black Americans believe that this happened simply because she was Black, is pointedly ridiculous.”

Talking with fans on Twitter Spaces later that day, Cardi had some words in response.
“Today [Candace] said something so disturbing about the Sonya Massey case,” Cardi said. “For you to sit here and say that ‘Oh not everything is racial. I know that this is sad, but this is not something racial. There’s more white people that get killed by the cops.’ […] Girl shut up.”

She continued: “You don’t feel one little bit of empathy, a little bit of sympathy of how this woman died? There was no argument, there was no conflict, there was no raised voice, and she got shot. He knew in the back of his head because she was a Black woman that he was going to get away with it. Not only did he think that, but the department thought that because they didn’t tell her son or her father that a cop shot her.”
Cardi B and Owens clashed on a few occasions including a salacious spat over The Bronx native’s raunchy No. 1 hit “WAP” and then in 2020 when the political pundit ripped Cardi and referred to her as an “illiterate person” on The Ben Shapiro Show.
