As if Drake isn’t already one of the most prolific rappers in the game, the 6 God has dug into his vaults and unloaded a treasure trove of unreleased music, videos and other goodies on fans’ headtops.
On Tuesday (August 6), Drizzy released approximately 100 gigabytes worth of content on the aptly-titled website 100gigs.org, announcing the move through his newly-discovered burner Instagram account, @plottttwistttttt, which he has been quietly updating since late June.

The mass of media includes unreleased songs — among them collaborations with Young Thug, 21 Savage and Latto — never-before-seen footage of Drake working on albums like Take Care, Views and Certified Lover Boy and other cool behind-the-scenes moments involving JAY-Z, Kanye West, Rihanna, Cam’ron and Aubrey’s closest collaborators.
Drake has yet to explain his reasoning for the huge data dump, but some have speculated that it’s to divert attention away from his high-profile feud with Kendrick Lamar, which didn’t exactly work out in his favor.

There might be more where this came from as eagle-eyed fans have noticed that Drake is also following another private Instagram account called @indigochild369, whose bio reads: “First account made some people anxious. Here we go again round 2 ‘FIGHT.'”
Check out all the highlights from Drake’s “100 Gigs For Your Headtop” offering below.

Metro Boomin’s “Trance” was originally supposed to be on Drake’s Honestly, Nevermind. Drake was left off the final version of the song, which may explain their recent beef.

The song ended up releasing on Metro Boomin's album 'HEROES & VILLAINS' — without Drake.
