Kanye West‘s former G.O.O.D. Music artist Kacy Hill has opened up about her “crazy” experience on the label.
During a recent performance, the Phoenix-born singer paused her show to tell fans about the struggle that she went through while being signed to Ye’s imprint along with Def Jam, and her attempts to get out of her contract.

Hill began by explaining how Def Jam had paid to shoot the cover art for her second album before they abruptly U-turned and told her they were unsure if they still wanted her on the label.
“I was like, ‘That’s crazy because I don’t want to be here either,'” she recalled saying. “I was like, ‘So do you want me or not? What are we doing here?’ I was literally in a situationship with Def Jam Records.”

Hill then said that she was informed by Def Jam that they could only let her go with Kanye’s permission.
Her efforts to get in touch with her then-label boss proved difficult, though, as around that time Ye had “decided he didn’t want to use email and he also didn’t have an assistant,” she said.

It was only after six months of attending the rapper’s Sunday Service performances that Hill was finally able to get a face-to-face meeting with Mr. West.
“I ended up going to this office in Calabasas and he was like, ‘Why are you here?'” she continued. “I was like, ‘Umm, I need to get out of this deal.’ And he was like, ‘Okay. What do I need to do?’

“I was like, ‘You can text literally anyone and say that I’m done.’ And so he did and that was done.”
In an amusing turn of events, Kacy Hill said she then played some of her second album for Kanye, after which he took a renewed interest in her music all over again.

“I played him some of my second record and he was like, ‘This is cool. Can you make it a gospel song?'” she recalled, prompting laughs from the crowd. “I was like, ‘Sure. Whatever you want.'”
Reflecting on her campaign to leave G.O.O.D. Music, Hill said: “This is a true story, I’m not exaggerating anything. It’s crazier than I could even tell it.”
