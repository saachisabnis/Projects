Consequence claims that he was asked to appear in a TMZ special about Kanye West‘s “controversial comments,” but he turned in down out of loyalty to his longtime friend and collaborator.
On Tuesday (February 6), Cons shared a screenshot of texts between him and Ye from a few weeks back in which he told the mogul that he will not be taking part in the project.
In response, Ye wrote: “That’s love.”

His caption read: “Loyalty over Royalties. I was approached by @TMZ to be featured in their special ‘Kanye West: Unhinged but Unstoppable.’ I myself have had great interactions with Harvey and Charles but anyone who really knows YE would know that he would feel leveraged and exploited by this move even if you’re speaking on him in a positive light.”
He continued: “That being said, even with what has recently transpired, I opted to pass… All Money ain’t G.O.O.D. Money. QUEENS GET THE MONEY.”
Despite the positive exchange above, things between Kanye West and Consequence have been rocky of late, which is most likely what the latter was referring to when he mentioned “what has recently transpired.”
In a post from late December, the Queens native aired out the Chicago native in an open letter.

“I’m posting this clip of the YZY Pods because I was asked to by a staff member but I have to get something off my chest regardless of the consequences…,” he wrote. “I have always lent my love, support and expertise to YE since ConMan Productions circa 2002. So @kanyewest NEVER again say in public or to others in private that you are ALONE. That’s the biggest SLAP IN THE FACE you could give to your TEAM.
“Guys like me, Don C, Monop, GL, Doe,IBN,Arrow and even Virgil (RIP) have given you big portions of our Adult lives so that we could all be ‘The Bulls.’ But we didn’t help you become Jordan so you could turn into Jerry Krause and start playing 3D Musical chairs wit da bros!!!”

Cons concluded: “You can be the one with the Money. And even the Power. But I will always need my RESPECT. If you can apologize to the Jewish community in Hebrew. Then maybe you should apologize to a few of your guys in English. Love you bro. But This Is 192.”
In the past, Consequence has called out others for “abandoning” Kanye West, including his fellow G.O.O.D. Music compatriots.
At the top of the year, he criticized Pusha T for cutting ties with Ye, calling his actions “disgusting.”
Then, in October, he posted a video questioning his fellow G.O.O.D. Music alumni for not coming to Ye’s aid.

“Where everybody else at?!” he asked in the clip. “I’m putting out an APB on G.O.O.D. Music. Everybody who got a check with Ye, where you at? You ain’t got nothin’ to do with this?! Why ain’t nobody else got nothin’ to do with this? Why I’m the only one in the headlines? I’m always the only one in the headlines! You know why? ‘Cause I’m the one, n-gga.”
In his February 2023 song “Disappointed,” Consequence continued to push this message as he rapped about how quick Ye’s signees were to disappear when things got tough despite having made loads of money thanks to the superstar’s talents.
“Everything I did in rap helped n-ggas get rich/ So they could trick on their bitch and put food on the table/ But when we in a crisis you can see who’s ungrateful/ The whole label ran instead of having Ye’s back/ I guess crabs in a barrel is the curse of being Black,” he raps on the joint.
