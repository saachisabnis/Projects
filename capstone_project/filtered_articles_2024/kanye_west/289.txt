Kanye West is trading rap for heavy metal.
The 46-year-old rapper turned heads when he took to his Instagram Story Wednesday to show off new metallic teeth, which the Daily Mail is reporting to be worth a hefty $850,000. 
In a second post, West compared his new look to the James Bond villain Jaws, who had a mouth of metal. 
The villain appeared in 1977’s “The Spy Who Loved Me” and 1979’s “Moonraker.”
The Daily Mail reported West’s teeth were fully removed and replaced with custom-made titanium teeth by the self-proclaimed “Father of Diamond Dentistry,” Dr. Thomas Connelly, and cosmetic dentist Naoki Hayashi.
However, Connelly denied West’s natural teeth had been removed, telling Complex, “He did not have his teeth removed. He still has a full dentition. Healthy and happy 😁.”
Page Six could not reach West’s representative for confirmation, but Connelly reshared West’s teeth reveal to his own Instagram Story and raved about the new look to the Daily Mail.
“Ye was a pleasure to work with every step of the process,” he gushed. “His vision for designing unique art transcends the dental progression.”
“The marriage of his Vision with dental science has created a new look that is epic!”

While West and Connelly seem proud of their work, fans took to social media to troll the Grammy winner for his unconventional dental work. 
“He is still an idiot, more money than brains!!! Get Help Man!” one X user slammed. 
“No way Kanye west went through with that. Look like he wrapped his teeth with gum wrapper💀😭,” a second added.
A third seemingly concerned person wrote, “this cant be real…”
West’s titanium creation isn’t the first time he has designed his own teeth. 
In 2010, he claimed on an episode of “The Ellen Degeneres Show” that he had his bottom teeth taken out and replaced with diamonds.
“I just thought that diamonds were cooler. … It’s certain stuff that rock stars are supposed to do,” he explained. 
He admitted, however, that he had to visit the dentist frequently to maintain his chompers.
He later told Vanity Fair he removed his teeth instead of opting for a grill because he “didn’t feel like having to take them out all the time.”  
West isn’t the only one in his family with an affinity for shimmering teeth. 
Last June, his 8-year-old son, Saint, showed off his teeth decorated with metallic Louis Vuitton logos on social media. 
His ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, also previously rocked an opal and diamond grill.
