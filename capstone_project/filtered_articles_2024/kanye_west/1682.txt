We cannot escape Kanye West’s antics. Whether he’s starting his own porn brand or hopping in the middle of the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar,  he’s always finds a way to get himself in the news.
Recently, “The Breakfast Club” co-host Charlamagne Tha God gave his thoughts on the Chicago rapper’s recent antics, specifically Ye’s appearance on Justin LaBoys’ “The Download” podcast, where Ye spoke about his issues with Drake, J. Cole and played his remix to the popular track, “Like That.”
Charlamagne said, “He is the leader of the Legion of Lame, okay? What a hating a** human. Like, what type of man sits around and says we were all energized by the elimination of another man? This man is so miserable and has never dealt with whatever hurt and pain he’s feeling and he just wants to project it onto other people.”
He is referring to when West said that Future called him to do the “Like That” (Remix) because everyone is “excited” and “energized” about the “elimination of Drake.”
Ye’s antics frustrated Charlamagne so much that he suggested that K. Dot and Future step away from this “feud” with Drake, saying, “Don’t you be a part of the Legion of Lame, Kendrick. Okay? Future, you neither. Run from Kanye. Metro, what are you doing? All of y’all should be running from Kanye West.”
Charlamagne later added that Ye “done made the whole thing corny. It was entertaining until he brought his jealous, envious a** into the picture. So lame.”
As we mentioned earlier, during his interview with Justin LaBoy, Ye also took the opportunity to take shots at J. Cole. When asked about how the North Carolina MC infamously apologized to Lamar, West said, “F**k all that p***y s**t… That n***a J. Cole went on tour with Drake. He know what it is it’s like you can’t run now it’s you also.”
Kanye also mentioned how Cole’s 2016 song “False Prophets,” was also partly about him.
This distraction takes away from the main event, which was supposed to be Drake vs Kendrick Lamar. But since one side hasn’t responded, it’s given opportunities to others not involved to enter the fold, like Kanye West knows how to do so well.
