Haywood explained: "Kanye West's outburst at a TMZ reporter undoubtedly has implications for his brand and public image. From a PR perspective, this incident could have both short-term and long-term effects on how he is perceived by the public and media outlets. As we know this is not his first rodeo with going off on a TMZ reporter.
"Let's rewind it back to May 2018, where Kanye totally stir up the newsroom over slavery, Trump, along with Free Thought. Ironically, the outburst just hit the same day an insider according to the NY Post, told the Daily Mail that Kanye keeps Censori, his wife from using social media. In the short term, this incident could further damage Kanye West's reputation as it portrays him in a negative light, potentially alienating him further from some of his fans, brands, and supporters.
"The aggressive behavior towards a member of the media can be seen as unprofessional and disrespectful, which may lead to backlash and criticism from the public but at this time I think the public is 'used to' Kanye's behavior."
Ye was caught on camera snatching a TMZ reporter's mobile phone when he was asked about his wife Bianca having any freedom. He then launched into an expletive-filled rant at the journalist, going into detail about his kids shared with ex Kim Kardashian.
Courtney added: "From a PR perspective, it will be crucial for Kanye West and his team to address the situation promptly and effectively, in terms of "getting ahead" of the fire that is already burning. A sincere apology or explanation for his actions may help mitigate some of the damage to his brand. Additionally, demonstrating a commitment to improving his behavior and handling of media interactions in the future could help rebuild trust with his audience, brands, and the media.
"However, the long-term impact of this incident will depend on Kanye West's ability to learn from this experience and make positive changes moving forward. If he continues to exhibit similar behavior or fails to address the issue adequately, it could have lasting consequences for his brand and reputation.
"Ultimately, it will be essential for Kanye West to take responsibility for his actions, apologize where necessary, and demonstrate a genuine commitment to personal and professional growth in order to mitigate the negative PR fallout from this incident."
