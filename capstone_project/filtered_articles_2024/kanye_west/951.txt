The Game has come out in support of Kanye West in a new trailer for a TMZ documentary titled Kanye West: Unhinged but Unstoppable.
The documentary, which is set to premiere on Monday (February 5), shows a variety of celebrities from across a wide sundry of genres coming out in support of the My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy rapper.

While Bill Maher and Angela Yee also agreed that West could never be canceled, it was the Compton rapper’s comments about West that resonated the most.
“You can’t cancel someone who doesn’t fear, or care, about being canceled,” he said in the promotional clip for the documentary. “That’s the thing about cancel culture: it’s fueled by the care of it. If you don’t care about being canceled, you can’t be canceled.”
Check out the full teaser clip below.
Last month, The Game shared that he felt Kanye West did more for his career than his ex-mentor, Dr. Dre, did — and revealed that the N.W.A legend wasn’t offended by the statement at all.
“At that time, Ye was doing a lot for me that he didn’t necessarily have to do. And Ye has always been there for me and always had my back,” he said.

“What I can say about Dre is Dre ain’t always had my back — for good reason. Dre has to protect the interests of Dr. Dre. And there were times when Ye had to protect the interests of Ye, but he didn’t give a fuck. He’d rather just go to bat for me.”
The Game added: “I was just speaking my truth … I’m pretty sure when Dre heard it, he didn’t feel slighted. He knew where it was coming from because I talk to him every so often, so it wasn’t like I was picking on Dre.

“He should have and I know that he understood where that came from when I said it. And if I saw Dr. Dre today, I don’t think he would feel a way about what I said.”
The “Hate It Or Love It” rapper originally made the comments during an early 2022 appearance on Drink Champs.

“It’s crazy that Ye did more for me in the last two weeks than [Dr.] Dre did for me my whole career,” he told N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN, shortly after the release of his Kanye West collaboration “Eazy.”
The Game later expressed some regret over his comments during an interview with Amazon Music: “I said some things that I meant. I’m not gon’ take it back — I ain’t no sucker. But having Dre do anything for your project, anything in your career, touch any part of anything you’re doing in life is such a blessing that I shall not ever shit on that again.”

He continued: “I haven’t talked to Dre since, and it don’t really matter if we talk again in life. I’m a standup Compton, L.A. n-gga and it is what it is. It’s just that I should have actually gave him more grace for what he did do and that was actually mentoring me and doing things that nobody could have done for me in my career.”
