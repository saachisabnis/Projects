Rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, posted a series of pictures of his wife, Bianca Censori, that has some people online blinking in disbelief.
Over the past few months, 46-year-old Ye seemed to be cultivating a pattern of sharing images of Bianca, 29, in scant attire, setting a particular tone for the couple’s public image. However, his latest series of Instagram stories, which feature his wife in a more tasteful light, marks a possible pivot from this trend. It really shows his fans that Ye is anything but predictable.

People online were surprised by the change in tone of Ye’s latest pictures of his wife.
“For once she has actually got clothes on,” read one comment on social media.
“She’s so pretty. Wish she would wake up,” another said.
“I feel like years from now she’s gonna come out like diddys girl saying how he traffics her and s/a’s her idk this for sure but I have a feeling,” read a third comment.
“She looks like she’s in trouble lol,” said a fourth.

Ye’s latest pictures of Bianca come after the couple were slammed for their plans of wanting to have “a bunch of babies.”
“You already know I’m impulsive/and another baby is my end goal,” the rapper sings in his newly released track, Timbo Freestyle.
Justin LaBoy, who is part of Ye’s inner circle, told TMZ this week that the rapper is serious about having children with Bianca and thinks a “bunch of babies” are on the way for the couple.

Some people online were not on board with the idea.
“Lordy, I am sending lots of prayers for those children,” one wrote, while another added, “Poor kids hope she wears a few more clothes.”
“Hope she dresses decent for her children,” another said.

In recent times, Ye has garnered infamy for pushing the boundaries of social media decorum, often posting pictures of his wife that teeter on the edge of the obscene. On several occasions, when the couple has stepped outside, Bianca has been spotted donning outfits that are daringly revealing, often sparking conversations and turning heads.
Bianca’s controversial outfit choices have pushed her enraged father, Leo, to ask for a sit down with Ye to discuss why he’s dressing his daughter up like a “trashy naked trophy pony.”
“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source close to Bianca told the Daily Mail.

“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands,” the source added. “He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.”
According to various reports, Bianca’s father, Elia “Leo” Censori, carries a notorious reputation as a gangster in Australia, having been jailed and convicted in 1982 for possession of a prohibited import, alongside convictions for possessing a pistol and fully jacketed ammunition.

Previous reports have also revealed that Bianca’s parents have been in a state of “distress” after seeing their daughter parading in public almost naked. They were also concerned that Ye may be controlling their daughter.
“Her family and friends are mortified because it just keeps getting worse and worse,” an insider told the Daily Mail about her outfits.
“Her parents are so distressed over this because they do not recognize her,” the source added. “She would not be doing this unless she was being controlled. He continues to lock her in by giving her more stake and ownership over various projects that he has going on, including the clothing.”

"Tasteful" LOL
I know right! I almost splurted my coffee over my monitor. To be fair it IS more tasteful than a plastic bag....
I mean, look at the man's eyes! They say everything you need to know. He parades her around like a naked trophy, yet he walks alongside her covered up like the Taliban, wearing clothing even over his face. She needs help, because yes, she is stuck with him, because she's too scared to leave. I've seen pictures of her where she does look scared, but most are just empty-eyed, as if she's given up.
I, for one, was wondering what Kanye West was doing. Thanks, BP!
