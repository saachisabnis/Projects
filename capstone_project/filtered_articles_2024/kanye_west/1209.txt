Kanye West has blessed his business manager John Monopoly with an extremely generous birthday gift, nearly moving him to tears.
A video emerged on Friday (August 2) of Yeezy, his (nearly naked) wife Bianca Censori and others at a dinner celebrating Monopoly’s 48th birthday the night before.

In the clip, Monopoly shakes his head in disbelief and says to the room: “He gave me a car!” while holding up a Tesla Cybertruck key card.
Ye can then be heard in the background correcting his longtime associate, saying: “It’s not a car; it’s a truck.”

Holding back his emotions, Monopoly says: “This dude right here is trying to make me cry,” while pointing at Kanye. “I’m not gonna cry this time.”
The pair then share a hug, with Kanye joking: “Only John can get this shit.”
Kanye West was also expected to treat fans to a different kind of gift last night, but it never materialized.
Despite an announcement on his Yeezy website saying that his long-delayed Vultures 2 album with Ty Dolla $ign would drop on August 2, the project has yet to be released.

In another since-deleted update to his website, an alleged tracklist for the album was shared, revealing 14 song titles. Many of the songs have either been leaked or played by Ye and Ty at their various listening events.
While the purported tracklist doesn’t show any features, a number of big-name artists have appeared on versions of the songs including Lil Wayne, Future, Young Thug, Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk and Don Toliver.

Vultures 2 has been plagued by delays since missing its initial release date of March 8. Kanye later announced that it would drop on May 3, but the album again failed to arrive with no explanation.
Despite this, Ty Dolla $ign has repeatedly insisted that Vultures 2 is still happening, saying during a livestream with controversial Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy in May: “It’s dropping ASAP. Vultures 2 is on the way. It’s coming soon. Any day now.”

Kanye has also teased that the project will forego a traditional release, skipping streaming services entirely and be sold directly to consumers exclusively through his website.
