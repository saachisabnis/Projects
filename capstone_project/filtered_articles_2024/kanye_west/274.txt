Takeoff will be posthumously featured on Ty Dolla $ign and Kanye West‘s upcoming album, Vultures 2, Rolling Stone can confirm.

	Along with including a verse from the late Migos rapper, the track, tentatively titled “Let Me Chill Out,” will feature Rich the Kid and NBA Youngboy and is set to be one of the “highlight tracks” of the ¥$ record, according to the source.

	During an interview with Justin LaBoy on The Download over the weekend, West revealed that the album — a followup to Vultures 1 from February — will come out on May 3.

	Since his death in November 2022, the rapper has also been featured on “Patty Cake” and “Back Where It Begins” from Quavo’s 2023 album Rocket Power, which was dedicated to the rapper’s memory.

	Quavo, Takeoff’s uncle, said around the time of the album’s release that he wanted to keep Takeoff’s unreleased music “very, very sacred… Knowing him, he’d want his shit right.” Takeoff died after being shot outside of a Texas bowling alley.

	West collaborated with Takeoff and the rest of Migos on “We Did It Kid” from his 2022 album, Donda 2, which never made it to streaming services. The track also featured Baby Keem. Following Takeoff’s death, West posted two photos of himself with the group, writing, “Love forever” and “Family,” on X.

	In one of the last interviews before his death, Takeoff shared his support for West: “Shout-out to Ye,” he told Billboard in October 2022. “You hear me, y’all stop fucking with my boy.”
