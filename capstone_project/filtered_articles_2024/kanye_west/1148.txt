Kanye West has been mocked by Tom Brady in a joke aimed at his ex-wife Kim Kardashian.
The NFL legend was the latest celebrity to be made fun of as part of Netflix’s comedy series The Greatest Roast of All Time, which premiered on Sunday (May 5).

Kardashian, who was a roaster at the star-studded special, was heavily booed by the audience inside the Kia Forum as she took to the stage to make a number of jokes about the seven-time Super Bowl winner, including rumors of them having been in a relationship.
When it came to Brady’s turn on the microphone, he took a swipe at Kanye’s parenting skills while hitting back at Kim, saying: “Thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad.”

The joke received a big reaction from the audience, while Kim smiled and shook her head.

The roast was attended by former teammates Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski, as well as former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, in addition to comedians and actors like Kevin Hart, Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck and comedian Jeff Ross.
Brady was generally a good sport but appeared to be irked by one particular joke by Ross about Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

During his turn onstage, Ross joked about Brady’s start in the NFL: “So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft‘s office and said, ‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?’”
Brady then walked over to Ross, who’d blown a kiss towards Kraft in the audience, and said in his ear: “Don’t say that shit again.”

Ross then replied: “Okay.”
The joke was a reference to Kraft being charged in 2019 for soliciting prostitution from a massage parlor in Florida, which appeared to have recorded the billionaire paying for sex acts.

Kraft pleaded not guilty and a federal judge later ordered the recordings of the businessman be destroyed after it was found they were filmed illegally. The case was dismissed later that year.
Kanye West, meanwhile, has yet to reply to being brought up in the comedy special and the criticism aimed at his parenting by Tom Brady.
