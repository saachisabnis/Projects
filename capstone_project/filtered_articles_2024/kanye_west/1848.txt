Amber Rose has admitted that she made up a past claim about Kanye West‘s preferences in bed.
In an interview with Hollywood Unlocked‘s Jason Lee, Rose walked back her infamous 2016 social media post about her ex-boyfriend where she said: “Awww @kanyewest are u mad I’m not around to play in ur asshole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.”

Her tweet was in response to an online rant from Kanye in which he ridiculed both her and her ex-husband Wiz Khalifa.
Asked about the tweet by Lee, Amber Rose replied: “It wasn’t meant to be a factual statement. But he said he owns my child! He said if it wasn’t for him, Wiz would have never met me and had a child so then in turn he owns my child.
“That’s fucking crazy! You don’t own my child but you miss my fingers in your ass. So that’s why I said it. It wasn’t a factual statement.”
Rose’s comments can be viewed below beginning at the 41:33 mark.
After Rose’s initial post, Kanye West denied the claim in a series of tweets.
He wrote: “Exes can be mad but just know I never let them play with my ass… I don’t do that… I stay away from that area all together.”

He added: “I’m not into that kind of shit… I like pictures and videos Me and my wife got the kind of love that can turn exes into best friends.”
Amber Rose was recently asked if she loved Kanye or Wiz more, and the mother of two had a quick answer.

“Wiz, girl. That’s not even a question,” she said while laughing. “I think people like to ask about my relationship with Kanye, but it was 13 years ago, guys. I obviously have to bring him up because he’s a huge part of my story and how I got here.”
She added: “But no, I feel like people are obsessed with that because it was a great time in pop culture, but in my personal life it is not relevant.”
