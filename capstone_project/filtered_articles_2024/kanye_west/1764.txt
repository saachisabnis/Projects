Kanye West made a surprise appearance at Travis Scott's Orlando show on Wednesday night, where they hinted at the collaboration earlier. The unexpected moment thrilled fans as Kanye performed the classic "Runaway" from his album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Kanye donned a white hockey mask, adding an element of intrigue to his appearance.
Prior to the Florida concert, Travis Scott, also known as X, teased the special nature of the event on Twitter. He reposted an image shared by Kanye, featuring the rapper wearing the same mask seen in his recent Instagram Stories. Addressing the crowd at the Kia Center, Travis acknowledged Kanye's influence on his career, stating, "I wouldn't be here on this stage without my brother, man. He opened up these doors for me... Make some noise for the greatest of all time." This echoes sentiments Travis expressed in the past, emphasizing Kanye's pivotal role in his success. Last August, during an early Utopia-era concert livestreamed from Italy, Travis asserted, "There is no Utopia without Kanye West. There is no Travis Scott without Kanye West. There is no Rome without Kanye West."
