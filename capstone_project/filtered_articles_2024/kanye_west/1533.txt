Tickets are available now at the arena’s website.
The event will follow two listening experiences in Italy days prior in Milan and Bologna, respectively. Those tickets can be purchased here.
Back in October of 2023, Ye was rumored to be performing at the RCF Arena in the northern city of Reggio Emilia. The show was reportedly being organized by Italian promoter Vivo Concerti. However, it was never officially announced.
That’s not Kanye and Ty’s only connection to Italy. The two superstars also shared a credit on Vultures 1 with a group of Inter Milan super fans. According to The Daily Mail, the fan group Curva Nord Milano feature as backing vocalists on “Stars” and “Carnival.”

As is often the case with the Yeezus star, Vultures 1 is embroiled in controversy. Earlier this week, West sent a message to his fans after the new album was removed from streaming services.
Vultures 1 has encountered a number of issues, with the track “Good (Don’t Die)” being removed from Spotify.

The entire album was also temporarily removed from Apple Music after a complaint was raised by its distributor.
Vultures 1 was initially distributed by FUGA but the company then said in a statement to Billboard that “a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement.”

The album was then pulled from streaming before a new distribution agreement was reached with Label Engine, who had also managed the release of the singles “Vultures” and “Talking/Once Again.”
After the drama, West posted a message on Instagram to his followers, saying: “With all the DSP’s taking the album down go to Yeezy.com to buy the album : ))).”

“Good (Don’t Die)” was removed from streaming services on Wednesday (February 14) after the estate of Donna Summer accused Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign of sampling the late singer’s 1977 disco hit “I Feel Love” without permission.
Summer’s estate said on Instagram shortly after Vultures 1 dropped: “Kanye West asked permission to use Donna Summer song, ‘I Feel Love,’ [but] he was denied. He changed the words, had someone re-sing it, or used AI but it’s ‘I Feel Love’…copyright infringement!”
