Mirror Media says: “[I]t was reported that the organizer informed the manufacturers that ‘the event is cancelled,’ but no official cancellation announcement has been made yet.”
As of this writing, the ticketing webpage for Sunday’s event, billed as a “listening and fashion party” and “not a ‘regular concert’,” does not list any cancelation. The most recent event update on the page is from August 10, and has to do with stage design and VIP seating.

West has been tinkering with the project, which, as of Friday (August 16), now includes an added verse. While the first part of the verse is taken from the original version, the updated track features West adding onto the song and exploring the concept of our time on Earth.
On the new version, Yeezy raps: “Just to cope, just a possible word of hope, like/ Maybe, possibly, if, time didn’t exist/ Four billion years in this bitch/ These lifetimes, blips.”
