Amber Rose has claimed that Kanye West — her ex-boyfriend — has 20 million reasons to thank her for her contributions to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
That’s the claim she’d made in an interview with Hollywood Unlocked‘s Jason Lee, in an interview which dropped on Thursday (March 14). There, she revealed that she had more than a slight hand in making sure Nicki Minaj had appeared on the smash track, “Monster” — a claim which, incidentally, was supported by Minaj’s own statements on the matter back in 2017.

“I don’t think I got credit for that,” Rose said at the 38:05 mark in the interview. “I mean, I didn’t do it for credit. And that’s not to take — Nicki, she’s amazing, when it comes to writing raps. Like, I’ve seen it in person. It’s a sight to see.”
When Lee pointed out that Rose never got any points, credit, or money for her role in making “Monster” happen, she replied, “I should’ve got $20million for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. But I got nothing. I should’ve gotten money for the wax figure that he used without my consent. Butt naked! But I didn’t get nothing. I didn’t get any money from anything. I should have been compensated in some way for using my likeness, and so many songs, and the wax figure.”
Take a listen to the interview below:
Elsewhere in the same interview, Amber Rose confessed that she exaggerated a bit about her ex’s preferred bedroom predilections.
Rose walked back her infamous 2016 social media post about her ex-boyfriend where she said: “Awww @kanyewest are u mad I’m not around to play in ur asshole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.”

Her tweet was in response to an online rant from Kanye in which he ridiculed both her and her ex-husband Wiz Khalifa.
Asked about the tweet by Lee, Amber Rose replied: “It wasn’t meant to be a factual statement. But he said he owns my child! He said if it wasn’t for him, Wiz would have never met me and had a child so then in turn he owns my child.
“That’s fucking crazy! You don’t own my child but you miss my fingers in your ass. So that’s why I said it. It wasn’t a factual statement.”

After Rose’s initial post, Kanye West denied the claim in a series of tweets, writing: “Exes can be mad but just know I never let them play with my ass… I don’t do that… I stay away from that area all together.”
He added: “I’m not into that kind of shit… I like pictures and videos Me and my wife got the kind of love that can turn exes into best friends.”
