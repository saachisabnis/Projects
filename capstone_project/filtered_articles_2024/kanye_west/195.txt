Katt Williams has made it clear that he’s not here for the Kanye West slander and claims it’s society’s fault that the embattled rapper is the way he is today.
During his now viral Club Shay Shay interview, published on Wednesday (January 3), the comedian was asked how he felt about a number of cancelled celebrities, which eventually led to a conversation about Yeezy and his rants.

“I suspect that we’re pretty awful people, if we say somebody’s got a mental illness and then we watch what they do,” Williams said. “If you say somebody got special needs, then why would you be watching them and holding them accountable like everybody else? Wouldn’t you grade them on a curve?
“I mean, what are we reacting to? You’re the one that put him in a position where he thought he was God. You’re the one that told the guy that writes musical lyrics that he’s a genius. […] What do you expect? The guy married a whore.”

He continued: “If what I’m saying is not correct, then how do she end up with Pete Davis [Pete Davidson]? No. I don’t support, or villainize Kanye, because I don’t understand what it is we want from him.”
Check it out below. The bit about Kanye West begins at the 2:32:56 mark.
Elsewhere in the interview, Williams took several shots at Diddy, who was recently accused of several instances of sexual assault but vehemently denies any wrongdoing.
At one point during the chat, the 52-year-old said he turned down an invitation to one of Diddy’s parties due to gay sex allegedly taking place at them.

“I gotta protect my integrity and that virgin hole I was telling you about ’cause P. Diddy be wanting to party and you gotta tell him no,” he said, referencing a previous comment that he was determined to “get this far in Hollywood and still have a virgin asshole and never have sucked a penis.”
“You got to tell him no. I did. I got the receipts for everything I’m telling you.”

Williams threw another jab at the mogul later in the interview while discussing his attitude towards women: “When I see people’s wives and stuff, I don’t even look at ’em. I don’t wanna look at anything I don’t wanna have because I know how blessed I am.”
“If I look at it, I got it. That’s how Diddy be feeling,” he added, prompting Sharpe to slump over in laughter.
