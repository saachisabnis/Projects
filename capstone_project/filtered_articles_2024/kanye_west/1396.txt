Buckle up, art and car enthusiasts—CART Department has teamed up with the legendary West Coast Customs to deliver a high-octane fusion of creativity and horsepower. Launching at the 2024 LA Auto Show, the Art Car Series showcases ten jaw-dropping vehicles reimagined by renowned artists and cultural icons. Running through December 1 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, this event is a must-see for anyone who appreciates the intersection of art, music, and car culture.
The Art Car Series features a head-turning roster of vehicles, each with its own story to tell. Highlights include:
These vehicles aren’t just cars—they’re storytelling machines, blending fine art, music, and contemporary culture into something truly unique.
Adding their signature flair, West Coast Customs complements the Art Car Series with custom builds that push the boundaries of automotive design. Expect to see showstoppers like Don Toliver’s AMG Mercedes and Wil.i.am’s concept Tesla, each a testament to the shop’s unparalleled creativity.
As Larry Warsh, founder of CART Department, explains, the Art Car Series is more than an exhibition—it’s a cultural time capsule. “The cars bridge the gap between art and popular culture, offering a compelling narrative of our current era,” Warsh notes. These rolling masterpieces capture the zeitgeist, preserving it for future generations to admire and dissect.
