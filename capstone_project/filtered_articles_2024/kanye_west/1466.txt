Cardo has shed light on Playboi Carti‘s eagerly anticipated new album, revealing the Atlanta rapper has been “finishing” the project for the last four years.
An interview with Lucid Monday that was filmed during SXSW earlier this year, the producer confirmed his involvement in Carti’s long-awaited Whole Lotta Red follow-up and described the creative process as “crazy” and “fun.”

“I’m going to Atlanta to finish up Carti’s shit. It’s been crazy — in a good way. It’s been crazy fun, just being able to wake up and he decides to drop a song you produced. It’s weird,” he said.
“I’ve known Carti since 2016, but me and him have been working on this new album for a good four years.”
Cardo’s comments can be seen at the 1:04 mark in the video below.
Playboi Carti has been hyping up his new album, tentatively titled I AM MUSIC, for quite some time.
Back in February, King Vamp joined Adin Ross on his Kick channel where he fueled excitement for the project.

“Mindblowing,” he responded when the streamer asked about the record. “My best. My very best — it’s actually insane.”
Carti kickstarted the album rollout earlier this year with a string of new singles including the Kanye West-produced “2024,”“Backr00ms” featuring Travis Scott and “H00dByAir.”

The spree led many fans to believe that I AM MUSIC was set to be released soon, but Carti has since retreated from the spotlight, even canceling his Antagonist Tour.
Despite the disappointment, the 28-year-old has still enjoyed a successful year thanks to two notable collaborations.

In March, Carti notched his first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 courtesy of Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign‘s “Carnival,” which he appeared on alongside Rich The Kid.
His “Type Shit” trap rap team-up with Future, Metro Boomin and Travis Scott — from the formers’ blockbuster We Don’t Trust You album — saw similar results, peaking at No. 2 on the chart on his way to a gold plaque.
