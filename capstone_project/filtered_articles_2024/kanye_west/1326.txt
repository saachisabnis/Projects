Kanye West and Tyga are among the names who have been tapped for the Fall/Winter 2024 lookbook for French fashion brand Y/Project.
The longtime collaborators – who were once nearly family for a period of time when Ye was with Kim Kardashian and Tyga with Kylie Jenner – appear alongside the likes of content creator Mia Khalifa, singer Charli XCX and model Irina Shayk to show off the latest drop.

Ye rocks a black puffer jacket that covers a majority of his face for his look, while Tyga dons a textured leather jacket with a headscarf and jeans that open from the side.
The brand was supposed to have a show at Milan Fashion Week last month, but was ultimately canceled due to what designer Glenn Martens described as “a cash flow issue.”

Late last year, Tyga decided to take a Kanye West lyric quite literally and shocked the internet in the process.
The “Rack City” rapper made an Instagram post with a carousel of photos of himself alone on a beach while quoting Ye’s lyric on “Monster.” “My presence is a present…kiss my ass,” he wrote.

To make his point all the more obvious, the final photo of the four features a bare-bottomed Tyga facing away from the camera.
“Wtf is u doin,” Nicki Minaj commented, echoing the sentiments of many other fans in the comments.

“I think you posted this on the wrong app,” wrote one person, while another joked: “That’s why they call him T-Raw.”
Still, more people noticed that Tyga had tattoos in some very private places.

“A grown man with ass tattoos makes me uncomfortable,” someone said.
There were also multiple calls for the rapper to delete the photo. “It’s not too late,” one commenter pleaded. Others wondered why he took things this far, with one writing: “I feel like there were better ways to get the message across, maybe?”

He has since deleted the photo in question, however, leaving up the three other clothed shots from the beach shoot.
