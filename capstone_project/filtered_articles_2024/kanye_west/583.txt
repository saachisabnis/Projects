Ma$e has a theory regarding Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa and 21 Savage – and it all ties back to Amber Rose.
On the latest episode of his It What It Is sports show with Cam’ron, the Harlem native theorized that all three artists made the best music of their respective careers during the time they were dating Amber.

“Every time Amber got with somebody, they made the best music of their life. Think of the music Ye was making with her,” Ma$e said around the 14-minute mark. “Think of [‘We Dem Boyz’]. That was when Wiz was with Amber. And 21 did his thing when he was with Amber, right? N-ggas made some of their best music.”
Killa didn’t fully agree, however – though he did recently name Amber as one of his top three women in the game (alongside Draya Michele and Lori Harvey).

“She didn’t find them because they were nice guys,” he replied. “They were making good music before she got with them. If they wasn’t, she wouldn’t have got with them.”
Mase responded: “Killa, you don’t get [Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy] from dating regular girls. You got that from Amber. You don’t get ‘We Dem Boyz,’ you don’t feel like that unless you’re with somebody that makes you feel like we dem boys.”
While Amber Rose and ex-husband Wiz Khalifa are no longer together, the pair happily co-parent son Sebastian together and recently threw him a ’90s West Coast Rap-themed birthday party.
The former spouses united late last month for a gathering with friends and family celebrate Sebastian’s 11th year.

“Sebastian is 11!!!! Omg!!! My baby grew up so fast!” Rose wrote on Instagram alongside a yearbook photo of Sebastian. “Still the sweetest, smartest, most charismatic, loving, Pumpkin in all the land! Mommy loves you more than you will ever know! My first born Angel.”
In a series of video clips shared on the model’s Instagram Stories, guests were spotted flaunting their finest West Coast style, grooving to beats from a live DJ and sipping on slushies.

Wiz, Amber and Sebastian also made time to snap an adorable family photo while stood in front of a photograph of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. Images of fellow gangsta rap icons 2Pac and Ice Cube were also plastered on the outdoor party decor.
