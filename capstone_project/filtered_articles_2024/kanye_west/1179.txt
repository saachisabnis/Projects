Kanye West’s former Yeezy employee, Murphy Aficionado, has filed a lawsuit against him, with 12 causes of action and a demand for a jury trial
Aficionado claims he experienced “unlawful termination,” and he was not compensated for his work
During his time with West, Aficionado claims the rapper made discriminatory statements about the Jewish and Filipino communities and "commanded" Aficionado to remain in the vicinity while West engaged in sexual activity
Kanye West’s former Yeezy employee, Murphy Aficionado, is suing the rapper (who has legally changed his name to Ye) and his companies, Yeezy LLC and Donda Academy.
He has filed 12 complaints against West, including discrimination, harassment, and retaliation; and is also demanding a jury trial.
In the complaint obtained by PEOPLE, Aficionado —who worked as a project manager for West's company Yeezy for nine months — claimed that he experienced “unlawful termination” and he was not compensated for his work.
A rep for West did not immediately return PEOPLE's request for comment.He alleged that West would make antisemitic comments, including "the Jews got [ex-wife] Kim [Kardashian] and my kids.'" West reportedly made discriminatory comments about Aficionado’s Filipino ancestry and allegedly told him to remove his “ugly” traditional Filipino tattoos, called “Batok.”
West allegedly also requested Aficionado come to his hotel room, where he engaged in sexual activity with his then-girlfriend, Bianca Censori.

Aficionado claims he began working for West in October 2022, worked 50-70 hours each week “and on several occasions even slept at the office,” per the filing. Then, in February 2023, West allegedly instructed Aficionado “to relocate [West’s] school, Donda Academy." The complaint states that Aficionado informed him of the required building permits, but West “became irate and yelled that he would not accept waiting or using permits.”
In July 2023, a Donda Academy representative claimed the school “would no longer be in operation." Shortly after, Aficionado claims his Yeezy assignments "were revoked, and he was no longer welcome in the offices.”
As a result of the termination, the lawsuit claims Aficionado suffered economic damages, non-economic damages, punitive damages, malice, oppression, fraud, attorneys' fees, and exhaustion of administrative remedies.
Additionally, “Defendants violated these laws by failing to provide plaintiff's last paycheck promptly and failing to pay penalties, including additional wages, interest, and fees.”

Aficionado claims that “almost immediately” into his employment, West “began to make his proud bigotry and antisemitism well-known” and “preached this dogma almost daily.”
He “would frequently make disparaging remarks about Jewish people: ‘The Jews are out to get me. They froze my bank account. The Jews got Kim [Kardashian] and my kids.’" West allegedly “aggressively responded" by telling him, "'The Jews convinced Kim [Kardashian]. She has Jewish masters."
The rapper also made comments about Aficionado’s Filipino tradition. West “pointed at [Aficionado’s] tattoos, telling him that they were ugly and should be removed.”

Aficionado also alleges that in November 2022, he was “summoned” for a “work meeting” in West’s room at the Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria. Once he arrived, “it was immediately obvious to Aficionado that Censori and Ye were very recently having sex.” West then allegedly "commanded Aficionado to come in and sit down" in the hotel room.
Censori attempted to close the door of the adjoining bedroom, but Aficionado alleges that “Ye reopened the closed door fully exposing Censori's nude breasts.” West then reportedly “asked Aficionado what he thought about Candace Owens' lawyer that had just left. Ye added, ‘I think he's a Jewish spy.’”
The complaint continues: "Abruptly and without warning, in the middle of their conversation, Ye dashed towards the room Censori was in. As he left Aficionado, Ye commanded: ‘Wait right here. Do NOT leave.’” Then West went into the adjoining bedroom, and allegedly, the couple had sex.
Ten minutes later, West rejoined Aficionado, allegedly wearing a t-shirt with a swastika. He asked Aficionado, “‘Don't you like my shirt?’ Intimidated and concerned for his job, Aficionado claims he replied, 'It is definitely unique …'"
“Then randomly and without solicitation, Ye sat down with Aficionado, showing him nude photos of his ex-wife Kim Kardashian on his phone.”

Later that same week, Aficionado says he was asked to return to West’s room. During that meeting, he alleges West and “a famous NFL wide receiver” were in their towels awaiting massages. Aficionado reportedly offered to leave, but West “commanded” him to wait in the room.
The complaint claims West then “had sex” with his masseuse. When West returned, “the NFL wide receiver went in for his ‘massage.’"
“Aficionado did his best to concentrate on his work discussion with Ye, but remained extremely uncomfortable, especially while the NFL wide receiver could be heard in the background,” the filing states.
