We’re rolling into the final days of November with a full head of steam, and the world’s biggest sneaker brands have one more round of drops set for us before we switch the calendar to the year’s final month. Nike, adidas, PUMA and more have everything from high-heat hoop shoes and altered takes on classics locked and loaded for this week, but before we dive in let’s take a look back at what went down over the last seven days first.
Nike had a wild week across all verticals, with two tenured collaborators, Stash and Hiroshi Fujiwara, teasing forthcoming projects (Air Max 95/Air Force 1 and Air Zoom Spiridon, respectively). Kobe Bryant got a tribute on two different Air Force 1 colorways — the “Home” and a black pair — that are set to release next month, while Travis Scott’s Jordan Jumpman Jack “Bright Cactus” had its official images revealed and several Nike/Jordan Brand sneakers debuted in Fortnite.
Not to be outdone, adidas made plenty of noise of their own. Olympic gold medalist Noah Lyles debuted a new Bad Bunny collab, while Jerry Lorenzo’s next Fear of God Athletics basketball shoes surfaced and the brand showed off a Foam Runner-indebted silhouette called the Lightblaze Moc. Other brands got in on the mix, with New Balance’s 993 having multiple moments in the spotlight thanks to the likes of JJJJound and Aimé Leon Dore, while OTTO 958 showed off its latest ASICS collab and stylist Veneda Carter continued her collaborative relationship with Timberland.
Now that you’re up to speed, check out what shoes are dropping this upcoming week and  be sure to hit up HBX to shop styles that are available now.

The SL72 silhouette was first unveiled during the 1972 Olympics — and with this new iteration of the shoe, it’s been reworked with a retro aesthetic that pays homage to the athletic footwear designs of the 70s. adidas and S&R have used a selection of blue and yellow shades throughout the collaboration, using the colors to nod to Sweden’s national colors. Customary Three Stripe branding is applied to the lateral sides of the shoes, while further branding is applied to the tongues and heel counters to round things off.

Why You Should Cop: The Air Jordan 1 Low OG continues to be a key fixture in Jordan Brand’s seasonal collections. While Travis Scott’s reverse-Swoosh designs often steal the spotlight, there are several in-line releases that deserve attention. Among them is the highly awaited “Game Royal” version. The sneaker has been designed with mesh tongues and an inner lining to bring in additional comfort, meanwhile, the white base is complemented by the “Game Royal” accents. Rounding things off, customary Swoosh logos and “Nike Air” tongue logos are added to the tongues, while Wings logos are at the heels.

Meanwhile, LaMelo’s signature “1 of One” and “RARE” logos are added (as expected), while a custom Scooby-Doo graphic is applied to the heel tab and PUMA’s formstrip to add an additional splash of nostalgia.
