MSU’s accreditors visit campus for review amid concerns overboard
Michigan State University’s accreditors visited campus 2 weeks ago as part of a comprehensive review of the university’s accreditation status, which was called into question last year amid infighting within MSU’s top leadership.
Though representatives from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, decide whether to renew MSU’s accreditation every ten years, recent turmoil within MSU’s Board of Trustees has raised additional concerns for their current review.
The HLC requires that a governing board must not be influenced by donors or those outside the university and must not interfere in the day-to-day business of the administration. An outside investigation completed earlier this year found that two trustees have done just that.
The HLC promised a review of the board concerns last year when accusations of impropriety first surfaced.
MSU argues that steps have been taken to address board actions that may have jeopardized the university’s accreditation, including implementing new policies and training for the board.
Looking at a timeline of MSU’s accreditation troubles, on Oct. 22, 2023, Trustee Brianna Scott publicly called for then-board Chair Rema Vassar’s removal, outlining in a seven-page letter allegations that Vassar overstepped her role as trustee.
Days later, an MSU administrator in charge of compliance with the HLC said that some of Scott’s allegations — that Vassar has repeatedly overstepped into the administration’s business, flew to a sporting event on a donor’s private jet, and appeared in an ad for a former trustee’s wealth management firm — jeopardizing MSU’s accreditation.
Then-Faculty Senate Chair Jack Lipton, a vocal critic of the trustees, wrote a complaint to the HLC the next month outlining these concerns. The HLC responded, saying the allegations raised “potential concerns” and promising a review of MSU’s compliance.
In January 2024, MSU wrote back to the HLC, saying the university was taking steps to remedy the board situation. Alongside initiating training on board governance, the university had commissioned an outside investigation to better understand the totality of the misconduct, Provost Thomas Jeitschko wrote.
In preparation for the HLC’s review, MSU published a 109-page document in October arguing why its accreditation should be renewed. It addresses all of the HLC’s requirements for accreditation, boasting enrollment statistics and an array of initiatives and programs supporting student success.
It also dedicates several pages to the board controversy, arguing that the university has “used all resources at our disposal” to comply with the HLC requirements on the conduct of governing boards.
MSU’s board has also continued work with the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges to develop policies around travel, communication and community engagement, according to the document.
In the coming months, MSU will continue reviewing policies on board conduct, implement an “enhanced onboarding program” for new board members and the next board chair, and have discussions with the board on crisis management and investment oversight responsibilities, according to the document.
Also, coming next? The HLC peer review team will draft a report on MSU’s accreditation within four to six weeks of its visit, according to HLC protocol.
The university has two weeks to respond to the HLC’s findings and recommendations.
Both the report and MSU’s response are then sent to an HLC decision-making body that would decide whether to reaffirm the university’s accreditation or make major decisions regarding its status.
MSU and East Lansing liquor laws explained
In a college town like East Lansing — lined with bars and next to a campus that sees an influx of visitors on game days — sipping an open beer could have different consequences or none at all depending on who or where you are.
When it comes to who you are, it is a nationwide law that people under the age of 21 cannot consume or purchase alcohol, potentially resulting in a Minor in Possession (MIP) charge. When it comes to where you are, MSU and East Lansing have different ordinances dictating where and when you can be out and about with an open alcohol container.
MIPs involve an underage person being in possession of an open alcohol container, trying to purchase alcohol, or having a blood alcohol content of 0.02 or more.
East Lansing Police Department Lieutenant Travis Bove said the punishment for an MIP is based on an individual’s number of offenses.
The City of East Lansing’s website says a first MIP offense will usually be written as a civil infraction, not a criminal offense, and is punishable by a fine and court costs.
If a second or third offense occurs, there is a potential to be charged with a misdemeanor, which could lead you to have a suspended license for a set amount of time. Second offenses also often come with possible probation and/or referrals to substance abuse treatment or community service.
East Lansing’s MIP ordinance states that any person suspected of being in possession of alcohol while under the age of 21 is required to show proof of age and may be asked to take a breath alcohol test. The disorderly conduct ordinance prohibits public intoxication and any behavior directly endangering the safety of another person or property.
Moving to open alcohol rules, East Lansing’s open-alcohol ordinances prohibit the possession of alcoholic beverages in either an open container or a container with a broken seal in any public place that isn’t a licensed liquor establishment. So, if you plan on finishing your drink on your walk home from a party or the bar, think again.
Liquor law violations are more common during the times of year that see an influx of people in the city, such as the beginning and end of the school year when it’s warm or on game days, Travis said. He added that they have staff at a heavier rate to provide safety in this case.
Looking at MSU’s rules, the universities alcohol ordinances are similar, but there are exceptions to the open container rule for specific events, such as on home football game days.
So, if you are carrying an open container on game day, make sure you stay within the bounds of campus. That’s defined as “bounded by Grand River Avenue, Hagadorn Road, Mount Hope Road, Harrison Road, and Michigan Avenue.” Once you cross over the line into East Lansing, then you are in violation of the city’s ordinances.
The MSU ordinance also states that no alcohol is to be sold or distributed on campus except at the stadium or for an event in which it was pre-approved by the board.
When it comes to alcohol-related crimes, Travis said it is also important to recognize the presence of medical amnesty, which is applicable at MSU and in East Lansing.
Medical amnesty is an exemption from discipline for violations of drug or alcohol-related policies for people seeking immediate medical attention for themselves or on behalf of someone else.
MSU also offers the Alcohol and Other Drugs program, commonly referred to as the AOD program, which is a resource for students suffering from alcohol or drug abuse where they can attend events to learn about recovery.
