Playboi Carti has previewed a new song with Future and Travis Scott that’s produced by Metro Boomin.
The Atlanta rapper played a snippet of the track on his Instagram Stories on Wednesday (March 13) as he drove his Tesla Cybertruck, though most of the song could be heard clearly over the wind.

Metro also posted on X (formerly Twitter) about the song which appears to be called “Type Shit.”
He also hashtagged “We Don’t Trust You,” which is the title of his upcoming collaborative album with Future, suggesting the song will be featured on that project.

Despite the hint that “Type Shit” will appear on We Don’t Trust You, Metro previously said that there would be “no features” on the project, which is due out on March 22.
A second album between the “Mask Off” collaborators is scheduled to arrive less than a month later on April 12.
If “Type Shit” does not land on We Don’t Trust You, it will likely be on Carti’s next album which he has teased will drop this year.
During his brief yet bizarre appearance on Adin Ross’ Kick channel last month, the Whole Lotta Red rapper raised the bar for the project by calling it his “best” so far.

“Mind-blowing,” he said when asked about the effort. “My best. My very best. It’s actually insane.”
Carti has released a string of songs from the album, tentatively titled I AM MUSIC, in recent months including the Kanye West-produced “2024,” “H00DBYAIR,” BACKR00MS” featuring Travis Scott and “EVILJ0RDAN.”

The most recent track, “Ketamine,” arrived earlier this week and saw Carti suffer an apparent machete injury in the accompanying video.
At one point in the clip, the daredevil rapper seemingly jumps into a machete that’s hanging from the ceiling and recoils in pain after it catches him in the arm.
