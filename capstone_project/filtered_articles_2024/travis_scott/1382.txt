Kourtney Kardashian is facing backlash over her spooky Halloween decor on social media. 
Fans of the reality TV star flooded her Instagram comments with various shocked sentiments after the “Kardashians” star posted photos of her Halloween decorations, which included a snapshot of two inflatable skeletons set up in a sensual position. 
“Hello October,” Kardashian captioned the images. 
Some of her followers called the display “disgusting” while mentioning Kardashian’s four children.  
“As a mother of four kids I find it disgusting you would do that to those inflatables,” one person wrote.
Another said, “The skeletons seriously? Any respect for your kids?”
“She’s such a weird do [sic] ever since she got with Barker  Dark soul … More conservative when she was with Scott!” one follower commented under the post. 
“Do you even care about your minor children seeing your disgusting skeleton display?” another person asked the Poosh founder. 
On the other hand, some of Kardashian’s followers praised the Lemme creator for the “wholesome” image she’s portraying closer to the holidays. 
“I just love this , plus I look forward to her posts all the time .. extremely wholesome 😍😍💕,” said a social media user. 
“Someone in my neighborhood had that inflatable and I drove by and literally said ‘that looks like something Kourtney and Travis would have in their yard,'” another added. 
Other pictures in the carousel Kardashian shared showed her pushing her and husband Travis Barker’s baby Rocky in different locations. 
In the first slide, she can be seen smiling down at her 11-month-old son while backstage at one of Barker’s concerts. They stood in front of a sign that read, “30 Rock-125.”
She and the baby can also be seen in the second slide in front of The Franklin Theatre — though, she covered her son’s face with a red heart emoji.
