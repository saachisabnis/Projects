Taylor Swift's football era never goes out of style. The 34-year-old songstress has been a staple at boyfriend Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs games this NFL season, always dressed flawlessly for the occasion. 
Since her first appearance in a private suite at Arrowhead Stadium wearing a simple red and white track jacket, Swift has continually upped her fashion game with custom pieces and intricate details that show her support of No. 87. 
As the Chiefs prepare to face off against the San Francisco 49ers at Super Bowl LVIII on Feb. 11, ET is looking back on every style Swift has worn to Kelce's games since first going public with their romance in September. 
All eyes were locked on Swift when she made a surprise appearance alongside Kelce's mom, Donna Kelce, at the team's Sept. 24 game. She stole the spotlight in a white tank top, Chiefs jacket, KSUBI black denim shorts and New Balance sneakers, completing her look with Jacquie Aiche Diamond Crescent Earrings, a corduroy hat from Ralph Lauren and a Louis Vuitton Camera Bag. 
Swift made it a star-studded affair when the Chiefs faced the New York Jets on the road, bringing pals Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Sophie Turner along for the game, with Hugh Jackman, Sabrina Carpenter, Antoni Porowski and director Shawn Levy also in the mix. For this occasion, she went edgy with Area embellished denim shorts, a black faux leather jacket by Gant over a black shirt, and Christian Louboutin Pumppie boots. 
After Swift attended her first Chiefs game, Erin Andrews told Variety that she had sent Swift some #Chiefs apparel from her WEAR by Erin Andrews line, with hopes she'd wear it. Swift did just that on Oct. 12, resulting in the windbreaker quickly selling out.
Andrews has played a part in the Swift and Kelce saga, as she previously encouraged the singer to give the tight end a chance after he expressed his interest in her.
"Taylor, I don't know what you're doing in your life right now besides rocking the world [on The Eras Tour]," Andrews said on her and Charissa Thompson's Calm Down podcast. "Please, try our friend, Travis. He is fantastic. I know we're not the best of friends, we're not even friends, but I consider you one. Take us up on this. Go on a date with this guy. Do it for America."
When that date came to fruition, Kelce expressed his thanks to Andrews for her support.
"😂😂 You two are something else!!" Kelce commented on Andrews and Thompson. "🙌🏻🙌🏻 I owe you big time!!" 
Swift rocked a red Chiefs crewneck and a black skirt as she watched the game from a suite alongside Brittany Mahomes, with a tribute to Kelce in the form of a friendship bracelet.
Eagle-eyed fans and photographers noticed that Swift was wearing a bracelet -- like those that Swifties pass out to each other at her concerts -- with beads that included the numbers 8 and 7 between two heart emoji beads. After the game, she pulled off her sweatshirt to reveal a red Chiefs T-shirt underneath. 
Swift braved the cold in a Stella McCartney belted teddy coat as she traveled to Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with fellow WAGs Mahomes and Lyndsay Bell. Under the coat, Swift donned an all-black outfit with Stuart Weitzman boots and a gold necklace. In the end, it was the first game that Swift attended which resulted in a loss for the Chiefs. 
Showing off some new swag, Swift wore a red crewneck with "Chiefs" written across the chest which, she paired with a black leather skirt, leggings, and black knee-high boots and accessorized with Mejuri's Heirloom Ring at the Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills matchup on Dec. 10. Again, the Chiefs came out with an L that day. 
Hot off her birthday celebrations in New York City, Swift traveled to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, with her dad, Scott Swift, in tow as the Chiefs scored a much-needed victory over the Patriots. 
Swift wore a custom hat from local Kansas City artisan Kut the Knit and a gray Chiefs sweatshirt.
"I mean, you don't see an entire home team fanbase go insane for somebody wearing the opposite team's colors," Kelce later said of her appearance at the game on his New Heights podcast. 
"Just shows you how amazing that girl is," Kelce continued. "They went absolutely insane when they showed Taylor on the screen, yes." 
Then, referencing Swift's own quote from her Time magazine 2023 Person of the Year feature, he added, "There might have been a few Brads and Chads that were booing, but for the most part everybody was screaming their f**king tails off for her." 
Kelce sweetly went on to admit, "I was trying to keep it cool. I was like, 'Don't show your cards. Don't show your cards.'"
It was another family affair for Swift at the Chiefs' Christmas Day game against the Las Vegas Raiders. While her brother, Austin Swift, dressed as Santa Claus for the occasion, Swift showed her own festive spirit with a Santa hat emblazoned with No. 87. Under her black coat from pal Gigi Hadid's Guest in Residence brand, Swift wore a red Polo Ralph Lauren sweater, a plaid Hill House Home skirt, and black tights with Prada heeled loafers.
Though the game didn't go the Chiefs way, Kelce still admitted to finding a silver lining after the "f**king worst" day.
"It ended well with good Christmas cheer and good people," he said on New Heights. "That's always gonna save Christmas no matter if you lose to the Raiders or not."
Swift caused a stir with her game day gear on New Year's Eve, opting for a matchy-matchy moment with Kelce. The songstress arrived wearing a custom bomber jacket adorned with Chiefs and NFL insignia, closely mirroring a nearly identical one worn by Kelce one week prior at his Christmas Day game. 
Designer Jeff Hamilton shared images of both Swift and Kelce wearing their respective jackets on his Instagram page, prompting the tight end to reply in kind.  
"Taylor Swift wearing a Jeff Hamilton off white Wool & Leather Kansas City Chiefs jacket for the victory of the @chiefs vs the @bengals today," read a caption on a carousel that included video of Swift's arrival at the game along with several close-up shots that showcased the item. 
Kelce couldn't help but shout out his support, commenting with a series of fire and raised hand emojis. 
Swift kept the rest of her ensemble simple, wearing a black top, straight-leg jeans and black high-heeled boots. 
It was a frigid day but Swift brought the heat in a custom puffer jacket hand-crafted from one of Kelce's No. 87 jerseys and a classic white beanie. The puffer was created by Kristin Juszczyk, who is married to San Francisco 49ers fullback, Kyle Juszczyk. Underneath, Swift stuck with her tried-and-true all-black style. 
Swift switched it up with a red beanie and a white varsity jacket as the Chiefs took home a win against the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Divisional Playoff game in Orchard Park, New York. In a rare twist, cameras were focused on Kelce's brother, Jason Kelce, as the Philadelphia Eagles center stole the spotlight by stripping off his shirt and chugging a beer as he cheered. 
Jason's antics proved to be a hit among Bills fans and with Swift, who was meeting Travis' brother and sister-in-law for the first time that day. 
"Tay says she absolutely loved you," Travis told Jason on their New Heights podcast.
Swift's Reputation era was on display as Kelce and his Chiefs won the AFC Championship over the Baltimore Ravens on the road, which secured them a spot in Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers. The pop star was rocking her curly hair and wearing a Guest in Residence red sweater with a black mini skirt and Christian Louboutin knee-high boots -- but it was her baubles that took center stage as she hit the field and planted a congratulatory kiss on Kelce. 
The pop star wore her Mejuri Heirloom ring, which has been a game day staple in her collection this season, and an "87" jersey ring from EB and Co., as well as a custom diamond tennis bracelet created by Michelle Wie West for WOVE that reads "TNT." 
West told ET that when she started brainstorming for her collection, she could think of no one better to take inspiration from than Swift.
"She's a big inspiration for the piece itself," West said of Swift, whose fans have been known to make friendship bracelets, a pastime the athlete participates in too. "... I just wanted to create a more elevated piece."
That elevated friendship bracelet, which starts at $5,600, is made of 14 carat gold and features four and a half carats of lab grown diamonds, WOVE CEO Simone Kendle told ET. Swift's specific bracelet features the letters TNT, a playful nod to Swift and Kelce's romance.
"TNT, dynamite. Their relationship is dynamite. It's just so cute," West said. "... I hope that [Swift] thinks it's nice, and sparkly, and pretty, and [that] TNT [is] sentimental and cute and funny."
As for how Swift ended up with the accessory, West told ET that she reached out to Kelce, with whom she's previously golfed, and explained that she was doing some gifting of her new line.
"When we created this elevated friendship bracelet, I told him the first person I thought of was Taylor Swift, because she's the queen of friendship bracelets," she said. "He's so gracious enough to support the collection, and be the middleman and hand one over to Taylor. I'm just so, so thankful for that. Especially emerging businesses, emerging lines... having the product in the right hands can change a person's life. We're just so thankful that he made the connection, and it got featured."
"If we could gift any one person our bracelet, it'd be the queen of friendship bracelets herself," West added. "So just very honored that he would actually give it to her and she would wear it."
Swift is set to resume her Eras Tour on Feb. 7 with a four-night stint in Tokyo, Japan, wrapping her set of shows at the Tokyo Dome on Feb. 10 -- just one day before the 2024 Super Bowl. 
One user on X (formerly known as Twitter) did the travel calculations, speculating on how quickly Swift could travel back to the States to attend the big game. 
"Taylor Swift performs in Japan the night before the Super Bowl. It will end around 10pm Tokyo time (5 am Las Vegas time),' they wrote. "The flight from Tokyo to Vegas takes 12 hours, meaning Swift can arrive at 5pm local on the day before the Super Bowl, 25 hours, 35 mins before kickoff."
A source told ET on Monday, "Taylor and Travis are so excited that the Chiefs and Travis are heading to the Super Bowl. They’re very in love and Taylor is super proud of him. They’re both extremely dedicated and hardworking and understand each other. They are relishing in this moment."
