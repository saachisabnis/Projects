Taylor Swift’s brother, Austin Swift, swooped in when a fan was being escorted out of a recent Eras Tour concert for wearing a Travis Kelce costume. 
Austin, 32, intervened during the Sunday, November 3, show in Indianapolis, Indiana, when security seized a young woman who approached a VIP area while dressed in a Chiefs uniform that included a helmet and a jersey with number 87 on the back.
Kelce, 35, was also in attendance at the show along with Austin and Taylor’s parents, Scott and Andrea Swift.
“Travis!” the fan yelled, according to a video her sister posted on TikTok. In response, a man wearing a headset placed his hands on her arms and pushed her away from the VIPs, saying, “Let’s go.” 
The man told the fan that “this is not allowed” — seemingly referencing the helmet and face covering — causing her to subsequently remove the gear as Austin approached. 
“Hey,” Austin said, telling the staff, “Let’s not put hands on people.” He then turned to the fan and introduced himself before adding, “I’m sorry about that. It’s a really cool costume.”

When he followed up with the question, “We’re all good here, right?,” security backed off, and Austin reassured the Swiftie, telling her, “You’re all good. … You guys enjoy the concert. Have a great night.” 
He handed her some guitar picks and praised her costume again before walking away, calling it “amazing.”
The following day, Austin, Andrea and Scott joined Taylor, 34, at Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Kelce during the Chiefs’ game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Austin has supported Taylor’s relationship with Kelce since the pair began dating last year.
In December 2023, Austin got Kelce a special Christmas gift and the NFL star couldn’t help but gush over it.

“He actually made me feel like a child because his gift to me was straight out of the bag,” Kelce gushed during his “New Heights” podcast. “[He] handed me a VHS of my favorite football movie of all time … Little Giants.”
While Austin hasn’t commented publicly on his sister’s romantic relationships, he has explained what it has been like having such an influential sibling.
“As a brother and friend I couldn’t be more proud, as a lifelong fan I am thrilled beyond words, as a human being I am simply dumbfounded at this level of artistry and depth of insight into what it is to love and to lose and to simply exist,” he wrote on Instagram in 2020. “Now please stop reading this and go listen to evermore by @taylorswift !!!!!”
