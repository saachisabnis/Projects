Travis Scott’s Nike collaborations have been some of the most sought sneakers in the game for a while now, and the collection only keeps growing with the recent release of the Mac Attack (or Cactus Macs, if you’re John McEnroe) and the upcoming release of the Jordan 1 Low in “Black Olive.” 
But Travis isn’t stopping there; during the recent Chicago stop on his Utopia: Circus Maximus tour, he gave away yet another pair of sneakers to one lucky fan. This one, though, is one that only been seen rarely: the Travis Scott x Nike Sharkidon, an as-yet-unreleased collab resembling his upcoming signature Jordan, with forefoot straps and what looks like Air Zoom cushioning/soles.

Unfortunately, there is no release date for the upcoming sneakers, although according to Complex, an inner tag in some preview shots indicates it could be coming out in fall of this year. Meanwhile, the official Jordan Travis Scott sneakers are billed for this spring, although these are not set in stone or confirmed by Nike just yet.
