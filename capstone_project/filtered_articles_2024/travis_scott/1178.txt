In sport, it can be a daunting challenge to face an opponent who was once seen in your eyes as an idol, but with enough experience on the job, the icon you once adored becomes a rival. Passing this inaugural test is a young prodigy who has made it out of Detroit, Michigan with flying colours.
Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner, a name attributed to the New York Jets cornerback from his youth, has held weight and grown in stature over the years. Two seasons deep in accolades, Gardner has made the transition from college ball to the NFL look like the easiest of adjustments.
Defensive Rookie of the Year is no easy feat, combine that with making All Pro First Team in consecutive seasons makes the young star look like a veteran. With such acclaim and high regard, Sauceremains humble and looks to take the Jets back to the playoffs as they try to reign supreme for the first time since 1969.
Ahead of the new NFL season, GRM caught up with Sauce Gardner to speak on the NY Jets goals, conversations with Lebron James, playing at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium and much more.
How are you feeling ahead of your third season in the NFL?
“It feels great going into my third season. It’s truly a blessing to be in year three. It’s going pretty fast, I’ve been learning more and more each year. I’m looking forward to going out there on the field with my brothers and just trying to dominate together as a team.”
What’s your expectations for the Jets for the upcoming season? Are you confident of making the playoffs?
“Just to continue to grow our brotherhood, to continue to have a great level of regard for one another and to play for the man next to you. As a defence, we always say how we’re a defensive organisation, but our offence has been given us a run for our money! It’s great for the offence to say we’re an offensive organisation and have an argument based on how great they do and how great they operate as a whole. It’s great to go against them each and every day. We know the sky’s the limit so we’re taking it one day at a time!”
Week 5 you play the Minnesota Vikings at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (October 6th). How does it feel to be playing in front of an international crowd? Does it give athletes more motivation to showcase their talent on a different stage?
“Yes, it’s great. I’ve never been out the country, but I’m a huge fan of London and the UK. I’ve just never travelled because every place is so far! It’s great to go out there and do what I love to do at an international level. It’s a true blessing.”
Being that it’s at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, do you ever get the chance to follow the football here in the U.K?
“I don’t really be having that much time to watch it! I see certain things pop up on social media which look pretty cool, but I never have that much time to sit down and watch.”
You previously made an appearance on The Shop alongside Ochocinco, Lebron James, Travis Scott and Ice Spice. What was that experience like for yourself being amongst other superstars in their chosen fields?
“Man, it’s great. A lot of those guys are people that I’ve watched growing up like Lebron James. Chad Ochocinco was my favourite wide receiver growing up. He’s the guy that I looked up to because I feel like our personalities are very similar. A guy like Travis Scott whose music I still listen to till this day! It was great being in the same room as them.”
We know there’s been a lot of media talk of Bronny James starting his career in the NBA, if I relate this to yourself, what was the biggest adaption for yourself transitioning from college football?
“Just understanding that you’re competing against guys who you were just watching a few years ago. That was the transition for me. It was shocking a little bit, like I’m really going against guys that I’ve watched so many years ago when I was young, and I was in high school and they’re already in the NFL. After you get to the middle of your first year, you already feel like you’re used to it. That will be the thing I say Bronny will have to get used to, but it won’t take him long at all. He has the ability. That’s how I was. Even though it shocked me going up against those guys, I knew I was ready to go up against those guys.”
You slotted right into the league, winning the Rookie of the Year in 2022 and have now made All Pro First Team twice. How does it feel to win these awards so early in your career and how do you mentally prepare to keep this level of consistency?
“I never feel pressure man! When you’re playing for the man next to you, playing with your brothers, you have a lot of reasons to do what you do. It’s not like you’re chasing the accolades, you’re just doing your job to the best of your abilities. These are just some of the things that come with it.”
With GRM being a music platform, what song would you say has been on a journey with yourself throughout your NFL career?
“It’s a song called ‘Closer’ by Goapele. I feel like that’s the song that’s been with me my whole life. She’s just talking about how she’s closer to her dreams. I feel like that’s just something that’s been with me. I’ve been listening to it since high school. When I got drafted, that was one of the firsts songs that I played. All my teammates know it, everybody like that song!”
What advice do you have for those trying to make a career out of sport?
“Just be confident! Be confident in everything you do. Be confident in your abilities. It’s crazy because this is off topic, but I was just in New York and I met a small business owner. He’s a guy that runs a train/car company in West Village New York. He’s now opening a new shop in uptown New York. There’s a lot of challenges that come with it, but he was so confident in what he’s doing. You have to think that he’s opening a shop in a whole different community, a lot of people wouldn’t want to take that risk, but as long as you’re confident in your ability that you can be successful, you will know that the sky is the limit!”
