Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker conceived their first child together, 3-month-old son Rocky, during their lavish vacation at the ultra-luxurious Amangiri dessert resort in Canyon Point, Utah. 
The Poosh founder posted a slideshow of Instagram photos showing the couples’ getaway, captioning the post, “One year ago today ❤️.”
The Blink-182 drummer, 48, replied in the comments section, “We made baby Rocky 🖤.” 
The Hulu star, 44, shared a snapshot from their ritzy suite’s window overlooking the stunning dessert and also shared a photo of herself modeling a sultry red bikini on the rugged terrain.
The lovebirds also enjoyed a soak in a beautiful outdoor hot tub, relaxed in a beautiful spa and as enjoyed as many delicious matcha lattes as Kardashian’s heart desired.
The Aman Resorts-run getaway is one of the world’s ritziest desert oases and is known for its understated elegance and immaculate accommodations.
Tucked away and secluded in red-rock country, staying at Amangiri offers guests private access to glorious views and first-class service while being right around the bend from Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. 
Suites for two start at a whopping $3,550 a night while a large pavilion can set you back $9,050 a night. 
According to the website, the jaw-dropping price includes three meals every day, daily scheduled group wellness classes and self-guided or group property hike. Each room also has its own outdoor lounge and fire pit.
Several fans flooded the comments section of Kardashian’s post to point out that the romantic destination explains why the resort was the destination where she and Barker made a baby together. 
“Well this is just the perfect cozy romantic situation. Which brings me to my next point.. calculating the date of conception 😁,” one fan commented on the post. 
“This where Rocky was put in the oven lol it was the magic there that did it 👏,” a second person cheered. 
“Oh so this is where you conceived!” another wrote.

“Stop was this where bb Rocky came about,” a fan gushed. 
Kardashian and Barker, who got married in April 2022, welcomed their first baby together on Nov. 1, 2023.
The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum had attempted IVF but ultimately stopped. She and Barker then announced in June 2023 that she was pregnant and later confirmed they had conceived naturally. 
During her pregnancy with Rocky, Kardashian was hospitalized for urgent fetal surgery. Barker, who had been on tour at the time, rushed to be by her side. 
Fortunately, the surgery was a success. 
“As someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn’t prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery,” Kardashian wrote on Instagram after being discharged from the hospital.
“I don’t think anyone who hasn’t been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear. I have a whole new understanding and respect for the mamas who have had to fight for their babies while pregnant.”
Kardashian shares three kids — Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9 — with her ex-partner Scott Disick. 
Barker shares son Landon, 20, and Alabama, 18, with e-wife Shanna Moakler. He is also a father figure to Moakler’s daughter from a previous relationship, Atiana De La Hoya, 24.
