Drake put up $10k as an added prize for his best doppelgänger after getting word of a lookalike contest going down in his hometown of Toronto.
On Saturday (December 14), Drizzy fans gathered at Casuals Cakery in T Dot and dressed as all different eras of the superstar rapper in an effort to win.

When Drake caught wind of the event, he sent a message to the organizer and added money to the pot to up the stakes.
“I’m adding 10 bands to the lookalike contest as the main prize,” he wrote.

Ultimately, a woman named Makayla Chambers took home the prize after drawing on a thick beard and rocking two braids like Drake did earlier this fall (before cutting them off.)
In second place was a man made headlines for hilariously impersonating Drizzy earlier this year – who even caught the rapper’s attention at the time.

Sharing some footage of the event to his story, Drake added, “I love this city” with laughing emojis.
In other news, Drake defeated a bunch of people on the other side of his “20 v. 1” beef, including Kendrick Lamar, to win Top Rap Artist at the Billboard Music Awards.
The awards, for which “honorees are selected by performance on the Billboard Charts,” were given out during a ceremony on Thursday (December 12).

Drizzy won three awards, defeating Kendrick, Future, Metro Boomin and Travis Scott for Top Rap Artist (all but Scott had been involved in the series of back-and-forth records and other disses this past spring and summer); taking home the trophy for Top Rap Album, as For All the Dogs defeated projects from 21 Savage, Future and Metro, Nicki Minaj and Rod Wave; and also defeating Lamar and Scott for Top Rap Male Artist.
Kendrick did not go home empty handed, though. His Drake diss “Not Like Us” won Top Rap Song honors.

In at least one other respect, Kendrick Lamar was a victor, too: his diss tracks out-earned Drake’s.
On Thursday (December 12), Billboard revealed estimates of how much money the two rap titans’ respective diss songs have generated in the months since their release this past spring.

Using data from Luminate, the analytics company that powers the Billboard charts, the publication estimated that the battle between Kendrick and Drake has generated almost $15.4 million in streaming, digital sales and publishing revenue in the U.S.
Kendrick is the clear winner of the two, statistically speaking, with “Not Like Us,” “Like That,” “Meet the Grahams” and “Euphoria” accounting for just over $13.4 million of that figure (almost 87%).

How much money Kendrick and Drake have personally pocketed is unclear as it depends on the terms of their label and publishing deals, which are not known.
