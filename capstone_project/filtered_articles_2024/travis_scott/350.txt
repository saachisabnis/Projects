Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker rallied nearly every member of their blended family for a special Christmas Eve photo this year, featuring six of their seven children. 
The heartwarming snap in question, shared by Kardashian, was posted to Instagram on Monday (December 30) and shone a bright spotlight on family time this holiday season. The Kardashian-Barker family posed in front of a large, glowing Christmas tree with pleased looks on their faces and love in their hearts. 
From left to right, the photo features Barker's ex-wife Shanna Moakler's daughter Atiana De La Hoya (whom she shares with Oscar De La Hoya), Barker's son Landon (whom he shares with Moakler), Kardashian's youngest son Reign Disick (whom she shares with ex Scott Disick), Kardashian, Barker, their newest little addition baby Rocky Thirteen Barker, Mason and Penelope Disick (whom Kardashian shares with Disick), and last but not least, family friend Carl Dawson.
Other family pics included in the sweet holiday carousel draw attention to the blink-182 drummer and baby Rocky spending time under the lights, and the Lemme founder enjoying the splendor of the season with sisters Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, and mother Kris Jenner with her beau Corey Gamble. 
The only family member missing from the first family photo was Barker's daughter Alabama, who was recently hospitalized for nicotine withdrawal after an attempt to quit vaping.
