KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Not only does it look like Taylor Swift is showing up to the Super Bowl, but she’s reportedly attending with her entire family, and will share a suite with Travis Kelce’s family.
TMZ reported that the suite will be filled with Swift’s mom and dad, Andrea Swift and Scott Swift, her brother Austin Swift and his girlfriend Sydney Ness. Travis’ group includes parents, Ed Kelce and Donna Kelce, his brother Jason Kelce, and Jason’s wife, Kylie Kelce.

TMZ said, along with the families, Swift is bringing along some friends.
Instead of billionaire Taylor Swift taking the bill, Travis Kelce is reportedly paying for the pricey suite.
Allegiant Stadium sources told TMZ that the suite costs well over $1 million, and we’re told that Travis is covering all of it because he just wants everyone to enjoy Super Bowl Sunday together.
Kelce referenced the cost of hosting everyone during last week’s episode of his podcast, New Heights.

“I’m not really doing much different other than just counting how much money I’m spending on this damn Super Bowl for family and friends to come. Just making sure I’m on top of those finances and losing all this money.” Kelce said.
This will be the 13th Chiefs game Swift attends after the two began dating this summer.
Kickoff for Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers is set for 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
