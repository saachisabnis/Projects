It’s been a decade since a little-known artist named Travis Scott released his second mixtape Days Before Rodeo and though he’s since become a household name he’s decided to revisit the project and bless his day-one fans with a blast from the past for his latest music video.
Dropping off some new visuals to “Mo City Flexologist,” Travis Scott commemorates the 10 year anniversary of his DBR mixtape which features clips of Scott’s life over the years which showcases just how far he’s come on his road to fame from his school days to his sold out shows.
Curren$y meanshile seems to be doing well for himself as well and in the DJ Fresh and The Musalini assisted clip for “She Can’t Be Mad,” Curren$y and company hit the late night streets in some impressive throwback wheels while getting lit with some female company in the passenger seat.
Check out the rest of today’s drops including work from Baby Money, Nino Man, and more.
