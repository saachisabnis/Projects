Josh Hartnett proved he's officially in his "Dad of the Year" era after taking his four daughters to Taylor Swift's concert in London.
Josh Hartnett is officially in his Dad of the Year era.
In fact, the actor recently revealed he treated two of his and wife Tamsin Egerton's four daughters—whose names remain private—to their first concert helmed by the one and only Taylor Swift.
"I went to the Eras Tour with my daughters recently and it was wild," Hartnett told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published July 2. "I’ve never experienced anything like it: 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium losing their minds, including my two daughters. And people were so respectful."
Of course, Hartnett's family participated in exchanging friendship bracelets with fellow Swifties during the show.
"My daughters were given so many bracelets and everything was really sweet," the 45-year-old added. "It was a good event for my daughters’ first concert."
Hartnett certainly isn't the first famous face who has supported the Grammy winner's record-breaking tour. Everyone from Prince William to Katy Perry and Jessica Chastain have popped up in the crowd over the past year.
Plus, Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce even recently joined her on stage during her June 23 concert in London. So how did the Kansas City Chiefs football player convince the 34-year-old to let him join her backup dancers?
“I initially mentioned it to Tay,” he revealed to brother Jason Kelce during the July 3 episode of New Heights. “I was like, ‘How funny would it be if I just rolled out on one of the bikes during the 1989 album. That era.’”
“She started laughing,” Kelce continued. “She was like, ‘Would you seriously be up for doing something like that?’ And I was like, ‘What? I would love to do that. Are you kidding me?’ I’ve seen the show enough, might as well put me to work here.”
However, Swift ultimately had the sports star join her during he  The Tortured Poets Department set.
“It was such a fun, playful part of the show,” Kelce admitted. “It was the perfect time for me to go up there and be a ham and have some fun."
