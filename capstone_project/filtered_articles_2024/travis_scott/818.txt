Managers for Travis Scott and Killer Mike took a spat public, going back and forth over a certain “Grammy winner” lyric.
Killer Mike shared his new album, Songs for Sinners and Saints on Friday (August 2), and many believe a lyric on “Still Talk’n That Shit” was aimed at Travis.

“You gonna respect me like a motherfucking Grammy winner/ Like I cooked your favorite rapper like a granny dinner.”
Mike also rapped: “I finally get it, all my haters, they was just jealous/ They wrote they papers, gave they speeches, no one gave a fuck/ I walk in a room and smile and applause erupts.”

Fans of Cactus Jack were upset when the Run The Jewels rapper took home three trophies at the 2024 Grammy Awards back in February for his album, Michael. Travis’ album Utopia was also nominated in the same rap categories, but he went home with nothing.
Travis Scott’s manager David Stromberg seemingly disagreed with Mike’s line, and wrote in an Instagram comment: “@killermike Macklemore and Cardi B tour selling out Chuck E Cheese karaoke nights near u.”

Killer Mike’s manager, Chioke “Stretch” McCoy, saw Stromberg’s comment and responded on X, formerly known as Twitter.

In an episode of LeBron James’ The Shop, Cactus Jack spoke about his not-so-successful history at the awards show.
Despite his frustration at continually being snubbed and a growing apathy towards the Recording Academy from his rap peers, the Houston native admitted he still covets a gold gramophone due to what it represents.

“A lot of my peers are like, ‘Ah, fuck that award.’ I fuck with it,” he said. “You play football to win the Super Bowl, you play basketball to win championships.
“I don’t make music to win Grammys but it’s what that Grammy used to mean is what I always hold on to. Like, the idea of music […] That award, at one point, it’s held up to a higher stature.”
