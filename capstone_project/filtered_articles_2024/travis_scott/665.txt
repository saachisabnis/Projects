Upset Logies viewers have taken to social media to lash out at broadcaster Channel Seven after the network's own stars cleaned up at the awards on Sunday night.
The exclusive event saw veteran Seven presenter Larry Emdur, 59, take home the coveted Gold Logie, as several of the network's programs and other stars also won awards.
Irate fans quickly took to social media to express their disappoint after other TV networks didn't have huge wins and lash out at the 'unfair' awards.
'Is the Logies all about Channel Seven personnel winning? But then who watches Seven?' one fan sniped.
'Because it's broadcasting the Logies, Seven is plugging its actors/presenters mercilessly,' a second person added.
'We all know the TV Week Logies are rigged, Seven wins everything,' a third person chipped in.
'How much longer does Seven have the Logies locked down for? Will be interesting to see if anyone other than a Seven personality will ever win Gold,' another person wrote.
The Logie winners are decided by the Australian public who vote for their favourite nominees, with the winner receiving the most number of votes.

Channel Seven became the event broadcaster in 2023, and in the two years it has hosted the ceremony, two of its stars have taken home the coveted Gold Logie - The Voice Australia host Sonia Kruger last year, and Larry Emdur on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Channel Seven also claimed several other awards, with reality series The Voice Australia winning Best Entertainment Program and RFDS taking home Best Drama Program.
The network also won Best Sports coverage for their broadcasting of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and Best Factual or Documentary Program for the John Farnham documentary called Finding the Voice.
However, other networks also won several awards, with Netflix's Boy Swallows Universe star Felix Cameron beating Seven's RFDS actor Rob Collins for the Silver Logie for Best Lead Actor in a Drama. 
Furious viewers questioned why Logies broadcaster Channel Seven's own stars seemed to win a disproportionate number of awards. (Pictured Seven's The Voice Australia presenter Sonia Kruger posing with the show's Best Entertainment Program award)

Emdur secured his first ever Logie Award at the 2024 ceremony in Sydney on Sunday night as he lead the celebrity winners.
The TV star, 59, has been a recognisable face on Aussie screens since the age of 19, but has never before secured a win at the prestigious awards ceremony.
In a milestone victory, Larry was crowned as the Most Popular Presenter as he took home the Bert Newton Award in his first ever Logies win.
However, other networks also won several awards, win Netflix's Boy Swallows Universe star Felix Cameron (pictured) beating Seven's RFDS actor Rob Collins for the Silver Logie for Best Lead Actor in a Drama
