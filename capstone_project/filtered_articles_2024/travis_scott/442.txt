Control Of Network Systems For Automatic Assessment And Remediation Of Processing Anomalies
Patent No. 12141809
A remote deposit capture (RDC) processing anomaly detection and remediation tool that can communicate with the RDC system over a network, and determine whether a RDC transaction is missing from the RDC system by comparing created and assigned unique identifiers represented in RDC transaction data received at a selected RDC system location or component with unique identifiers represented in RDC transaction data received at a RDC system location or component that is upstream thereof. In response to finding a missing RDC transaction, the tool can determine one or more RDC system remediation actions, execute the one or more RDC system remediation actions on the RDC system, and report the missing RDC transaction and any RDC system remediation actions executed on the RDC system.
