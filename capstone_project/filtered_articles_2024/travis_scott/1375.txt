GREENVILLE, S.C. (FOX Carolina) - South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced indictments for narcotics trafficking investigation known as “Devil in Disguise.”
To date, Wilson said five indictments have been issued in three Upstate counties against 64 defendants on 327 narcotics and related charges. This investigation has primarily focused on fentanyl trafficking and associated overdoses.
The State Grand Jury has indicted alleged fentanyl dealers for murder, accessory before the fact to murder, and conspiracy to commit murder for their alleged role in distributing fentanyl to victims who died from resulting overdoses.
The attorney general said other charges brought to date from this investigation include trafficking in fentanyl, trafficking in methamphetamine, trafficking heroin, trafficking cocaine, money laundering, and illegal possession of a weapon, as well as possession, possession with intent to distribute, and distribution charges for the various narcotics involved.
“Unfortunately, we all know the very real, life-altering effects of the opiate and opioid crisis because it impacts every community across the state,” said Attorney General Alan Wilson. “But when dangerous drug dealers wreak havoc by bringing in fentanyl and more, we’ve got an army coming for them. We will use every tool at our disposal to hold these criminals accountable, and that includes murder charges for overdoses against the dealers.”
According to the Greenville County Coroner’s Office, Greenville County had 278 drug-related overdose deaths in 2022, most of which were related to fentanyl trafficking. In response to the growing number of overdose deaths, SLED, the Greenville County Drug Enforcement Unit, the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office, and the United States Department of Homeland Security combined resources to investigate these deaths and attempt to identify the parties involved. A South Carolina State Grand Jury investigation marshalling these combined resources has been proceeding since August resulting in the indictments unsealed on Wednesday.
Through this investigation, the attorney general said at least six fentanyl overdose deaths have been allegedly tied to this trafficking and distribution conspiracy, with eight other overdoses still being investigated. Law enforcement has also learned that fentanyl is being used to adulterate heroin, cocaine, meth, and other illegal drugs.
To date, the investigation through controlled purchases and seizures has recovered over 1 kilogram of fentanyl and 1.5 kilograms of meth, among other drugs. The investigation revealed the conspiracy has historically moved more than 500 kilograms of fentanyl since January of 2020, along with similar amounts of meth and cocaine.
Bond hearings for the 64 defendants will take place on Wednesday, Jan. 3 and Thursday, Jan. 4.
