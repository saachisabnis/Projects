Travis Scott‘s 2021 Astroworld festival tragedy resulted in 10 wrongful death lawsuits against the rapper and a myriad of companies, but they’ve almost all been settled.
According to a report published by ABC News on Wednesday (May 8), just one case is currently pending while all others — including one that was set to go to trial this week — have been confidentially settled.

The final lawsuit was filed by the family of 9-year-old Ezra Blount, the youngest person killed at the concert.
Last month, a judge denied the Houston rapper’s motion to be dismissed from the Astroworld lawsuits. District Judge Kristen Hawkins issued her ruling without explanation, meaning that the civil suits will be permitted to move forward.

If found liable, Scott and Live Nation will be facing a court-ordered payout of billions of dollars in damages to the victims.
In March, Cactus Jack’s attorneys argued that the responsibility for the fans’ safety lies with event organizers and the venue’s staff.

“Like any other adrenaline-inducing diversion, music festivals must balance exhilaration with safety and security—but that balance is not the job of performing artists, even those involved in promoting and marketing performances,” lawyer Daniel Petrocelli wrote.
“Which only makes sense: Performing artists, even those who engage in certain promotional activities, have no inherent expertise or specialized knowledge in concert safety measures, venue security protocols, or site-design.”

He continued: “When, during festival planning, concerns arose about the risk of a stampede occurring in the festival site, the Scott defendants supported festival organizers’ efforts to eliminate that risk by agreeing to remove certain rides and other attractions at the site. Then, when the Scott defendants were told to end the show after Mr. Scott’s guest performer finished performing, they did just that—ending the show as directed.”
While Travis remains a part of the legal proceedings, Drake has been dismissed from the plaintiff’s claims.

Earlier this year, the rapper’s attorneys requested that he have his name removed from the suits while claiming that he was not involved in the even’t planning.
In April, NBC News reported that Judge Hawkins approved the request.

Several companies such as Apple Inc. as well as Scott’s Cactus Jack Enterprises and LaFlame Enterprises had similar requests denied.
Last year, a grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against the “Sicko Mode” rapper over the tragedy. That decision took place about a month after Houston Police issued a nearly 1,300-page report detailing its investigation.
