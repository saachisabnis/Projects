The Flyers went back in the win column Saturday night, besting Claude Giroux's Senators 4-2 to keep pace in the Metropolitan Division playoff race ‚Äî¬†and they did it without Travis Konecny and a handful of other players currently off the ice nursing injuries.
Here's a look at what we saw in the second game of a back-to-back in South Philly:
‚Ä¢ After blowing a 2-0 lead in epic fashion just one night earlier ‚Äî in Washington 5-2 ‚Äî the Flyers came out feisty and in control, hopping on the Sens early by netting a Joel Farabee's re-direct from a Nick Seeler wrist shot from the point just over one minute into the game.¬†

It's confidence instilling for fans to see a team that desperately wants to remain in contention a few months from now having a short memory. They looked just about as good as a team can in the first period, out-shooting¬†Ottawa¬†by a ridiculous 19-4.
‚Ä¢ Nothing fancy on Tyson Foerster's second period goal, fired on net after a Scott Laughton face-off win. The youngster's fifth strike in five games put the Flyers back up 2-1:

His next goal ‚Äî scored not long after ‚Äî was more dramatic as he converted a penalty shot just before the second period buzzer. It was, of course, his sixth in five games and gave Philly some breathing room with a two-goal edge.

The lead after two is a good spot to be this season ‚Äî after Saturday's win, the team is now 20-2-2 when leading after 40 minutes.
‚Ä¢ We'll dig into the Flyers special teams a little later on, but their penalty kill once again flexed its muscles with a masterclass in the third period, killing off a double-minor and then another penalty to suck a lot of life out of the Senators. They were nearly perfect through nine and a half short-handed minutes ‚Äî but relented with two minutes to go in the third, short-handed and up against an extra attacker. The Senator's second goal came in a 6-on-4 situation.
Even still, here's a look at one of the better PK units in the entire league, a unit that no doubt was key in Saturday's victory:
‚Ä¢ Credit to Flex Sandstrom, who has been inconsistent but came to play Saturday stopping 26 shots and coming up big during a few short-handed situations in the third period.
‚Ä¢ Also credit to Cam York for drilling a meaningless empty netter with less than one second to play.
‚Ä¢ The Senators came out in the second period looking ashamed of their performance in the game's first 20 minutes and Vladimir Tarasenko was able to convert this effort into a goal as a very pretty backhand shot bested Sandstrom to even things at 1-all. Thrust into a backup role in net, the 26-year-old netminder has allowed nearly four goals per game and is one of the weaker spots on this roster right now.
‚Ä¢ The Flyers remind me a little of a good NBA team that doesn't know how to play half-court offense. For a variety of reasons that we won't dive into too deeply in this space, their power play remains positively futile.¬†
Ottawa had three penalties in the opening period alone (and four in all), almost appearing to prefer playing short-handed, knowing the Flyers are among the worst in hockey with an extra man. Philly failed to score each time.Their stats coming into this one:
It's not for a lack of effort, nor a lack of chances. Each power play opportunity created its share of shots on goal, but few of them were high quality looks.
This has been a theme in 5-on-5 as well, where they are admittedly much better scoring-wise. The Flyers pepper goalies with shots ‚Äî it's one of their offensive identities.¬†The squad entered Saturday's contest with the second most shots fired on net in all of the NHL. Which makes sense ‚Äî as they routinely out-shoot their opponents. But it's also resulted in them sporting the third worst scoring rate on SOG, 8.9% for the year.¬†
‚Ä¢ It was superhero night at the Wells Fargo Center, and while it was corny, it was also quite revealing to learn that Gritty is, indeed, Spiderman:
