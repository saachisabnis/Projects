A lot of people like Travis Scott's sneakers. Ben Affleck does. Bradley Cooper too. The problem is, every single time they drop, they sell out within seconds. So if you (like pretty much every single one of us) have taken a L, the Nike Dunk Low Next Nature ‘Baroque Brown’ was made as a next best thing.
Nike Dunk Low Next Nature ‘Baroque Brown’
Working on top of a ‘Baroque Brown’ base, this Dunk Low is overlaid by panels and panels of ‘Summit White’ throughout. It looks almost identical to the Texas-born rapper's Air Jordan 1 Low ‘Reverse Mocha’ from 2022 and the freshly-announced Jumpman Jack ‘Sail.’ In fact, this inspo is further highlighted with the ‘Khaki’ Swoosh that glides across the lateral and medial sidewalls. All of this then sits on top of a creamy rubber midsole, which, again, takes a leaf out of Scott's book.

But unlike any of the Utopia artist's Air Jordan trainers, what makes this pair a little more special is the fact that it's part of the ‘Next Nature’ series. That means at least 20 per cent is made from recycled material.
The sole is also infused with Nike Grind, which are basically scraps of rubber. So if you didn't manage to secure the latest Travis Scott collab, that's OK! Just get this slightly eco-friendlier version instead.

The Nike Dunk Low Next Nature ‘Baroque Brown’ is set to drop sometime in Autumn 2024 at Nike, the Snkrs app, and select stockists across the globe. Expect to pay about £110.
