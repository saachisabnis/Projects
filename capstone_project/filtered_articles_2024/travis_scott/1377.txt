				Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are parents to their two children, despite having split for good in 2023.			

Find Out

Kylie Jenner shares two children—Stormi Webster, her 6-year-old daughter, and Aire Webster, her 2-year-old son—with her ex-partner, rapper Travis Scott.
Jenner was just 20 years old when Stormi was born, but becoming a mom was something she always felt destined for. “I used to have dreams, even at a young age, of having kids, like actual dreams,” she told James Charles in a joint YouTube video in October 2018. “It was just a part of my life that I was craving. I don’t feel like a different person. I just look at life a little differently.”
The Kylie Cosmetics founder, 27, and ‘Sicko Mode’ rapper, 33, announced they were expanding their family in September 2021 when Jenner posted an Instagram video showing a positive pregnancy test, followed by their daughter kissing her belly.
Although Jenner and Scott—real name Jacques Webster—had an on-and-off relationship that spanned nearly five years since they were first linked at Coachella in April 2017, the parents have remained dedicated to co-parenting their two children.
Since becoming a mom in 2018, Jenner has shared glimpses into her family life with her 398 million Instagram followers. On Mother’s Day in 2022, she reflected on being a young mom in a sweet Instagram caption for her daughter: “Being a young mom just means we met a little early, and I get to love you a little longer,” she wrote.
Here’s everything to know about the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister’s two children.
In February 2018, Jenner broke the internet when she revealed that she had given birth to her first child, Stormi Webster, after keeping her entire pregnancy under wraps. The reality star announced, in the midst of Super Bowl Sunday, that her daughter had been born on February 1, 2018, in Los Angeles. Stormi was delivered at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, weighing 8 pounds, 9 ounces.
“I understand you’re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free, and healthy way I knew how,” she wrote on Instagram. Jenner also shared a montage of intimate, candid videos from her pregnancy on YouTube.
Since her birth, Stormi, whom Jenner has described as the “perfect mixture” of her and Scott, made her red carpet debut at just 18 months old at the premiere of Scott’s Netflix documentary Look Mom I Can Fly. She has also attended the 72nd annual Parsons Benefit in 2021, the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, and most recently, Valentino’s Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2024 show at Paris Fashion Week.
Stormi is also poised to follow in her mom’s footsteps as a successful businesswoman—Jenner was named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire by Forbes in 2019. The toddler has been accompanying Jenner to the office and influencing her businesses—which now include Kylie Cosmetics, Kylie Skin, Kylie Swim, and Kylie Baby—since she was just a baby herself. According to Jenner, Stormi even “has her own office where she gets all her business done.”
“Stormi is my legacy. I’m raising her to be smart and kind and driven,” Jenner told tmrw magazine in May 2021. “Maybe she will take over Kylie Cosmetics one day? Only if she wants to.”

In September 2021, Jenner confirmed her second pregnancy with a touching video on Instagram. On February 2, 2022—just one day after Stormi’s 4th birthday—she welcomed her son at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.
“Finding myself in the hospital alone with a new and unknown creature in my arms. It’s such a unique and special situation, and it’s all about building with these little beings that you’re learning about,” she told Vanity Fair Italy the following year.
Aire Webster was originally named Wolf Jacques Webster, but shortly after choosing the name Wolf, Jenner revealed on the season 3 finale of The Kardashians that she regretted the choice for her son’s name.
“I didn’t realize the postpartum would hit me that hard. I never called him Wolf, ever…that night, I cried in the shower,” she shared in a confessional.
On March 22, 2022, Jenner posted on her Instagram Story that their son would no longer go by the name Wolf.
“FYI our son’s name isn’t Wolf anymore 😅😅. We just really didn’t feel like it was him. Just wanted to share because I keep seeing Wolf everywhere,” Jenner wrote, adding a prayer hands emoji. In January 2023, she announced that her son’s new name is Aire—a name with Hebrew roots that means “Lion of God”—which was legally granted later that year.
While Jenner shared a few snaps of her baby boy during his first year, the world got a more in-depth look at his life when she posted a video tribute in honor of his first birthday. The montage featured moments of them hanging out at the beach, having fun on a swing set, and other sweet memories. Stormi also made a cameo, playing with her baby brother.
“AIRE. my son, my moon, my stars. best year of my life with you,” she wrote on Instagram. “You complete us, my angel. Mommy loves you. Happy 1st birthday. May God always bless you.”
Since Aire’s birth, Jenner has been relatively private about sharing information about him with the world, but she has occasionally taken to social media to share small moments, like a walk in the sun together or his first time eating ice cream during a trip to Disneyland.
