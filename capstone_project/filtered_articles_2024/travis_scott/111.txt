Update: Travis Scott has had his hands full with the amount of sneaker collaborations dropping both this year and next that he’s involved in. Aside from his new signature shoes with Jordan Brand and Nike, he’s continued to operate on the Air Jordan 1 Low OG. A myriad of colorways popped up as rumors this year, including a “Pink Pack” that is now said to be cancelled, according to MrUnloved1s. The two pairs, which we discussed below, join the “Black Olive” colorway in being reportedly cancelled as plans on Jordan Brand’s end continue to shift in anticipation of the 40th anniversary of the Air Jordan 1 next year. That being said, there are still plenty of pairs to look forward to from the duo as the “Medium Olive” and “Dark Mocha” looks are currently slated to drop by the end of the year and a “Pale Vanilla” pair is expected alongside a new fragment design collaboration next year. Stay tuned for updates regarding everything Travis Scott x Jordan Brand as we await official word from the duo.
Both of these are canceled btw. Don’t know if I said this yet.. https://t.co/PGo3TEWyKv

Original Story: Travis Scott has a new Air Jordan 1 Low OG in the works with Nike, slated to release in Spring 2025.
News of the Air Jordan 1 Low OG in a pink and brown “Dark Pony/Pink Oxford” colorway recently surfaced and is now joined by word of a “Sail/Shy Pink” look thanks to a rumor and mock-up by Sneakermarketro. While the former is being exclusively offered in women’s sizes, the latter is said to arrive in men’s sizing.
Similar to the “Dark Pony/Pink Oxford” colorway, we expect the Swoosh to be flipped and appear in a lighter beige shade that also appears at the sole. Pink laces and a pink logo on the toe tab add a pop of color to the otherwise muted sneaker, while the Cactus Jack smile logo is likely embroidered at the heel tab in typical La Flame fashion.
Priced at $150 USD, the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low in “Sail/Shy Pink” will be offered in men’s, toddler and preschool sizes. As Nike readies to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Air Jordan 1, fans have more sneakers to look out for in the coming months.
