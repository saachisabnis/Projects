Drake‘s ghostwriting drama has continued after what appears to be a reference track for “Mob Ties” made by Vory leaked online.
The origin of the leak is not yet known and neither Drake nor Vory have commented on its veracity.

The Grammy-nominated singer, who was previously signed to Meek Mill‘s Dream Chasers label, has always been a credited co-writer on the track but commentators such as Akademiks have previously claimed that he did play an integral role.
The media personality said of Vory’s credit on the song on his Rumble channel: “He is credited but he ain’t write nothing […] I’ma tell you how I know he ain’t write shit for Drake: [‘Mob Ties’] was almost like a Toronto n-gga spitting.”

Remember when DJ Akademiks said:
“He [Vory] is credited, but he ain’t write NOTHING!!”
Well, well.. just another case of Drake Stans bein in denial and out of touch with reality.

Vory is not the first artist to be accused of giving Drake a helping hand in the studio.
Lil Yachty was recently claimed to have written “Jumbotron Shit Poppin” — from the 6 God’s joint album with 21 Savage, Her Loss — after an alleged reference track surfaced online.

Rick Ross, who had dissed Drake both on songs and social media, used the rumors as more ammo against his former collaborator.
“Yacht Put ya phone on silent lil bro.. [100 emoji] #BBLDRIZZY CALLING AGAIN [nose emoji, hand emoji, laughing emoji],” he wrote online, referencing his previous claims that Drizzy had undergone plastic surgery.

He added: “YACHT AKA THE PEN [five writing emojis].”
Rozay also claimed that Drake had somebody else write his verse on Travis Scott‘s smash hit “Sicko Mode.”

While filming himself in a club as the song blared through the speakers, the MMG mogul said: “Who wrote this? Guess who wrote this? You would never guess who wrote this,” before bursting into laughter.
Ghostwriting allegations have dogged Drake since the release of 2015’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, which featured multiple songwriting credits for Quentin Miller.

Though Miller has always denied working as a ghostwriter for the Canadian superstar, he has said he was never paid for his work on the project due to a publishing deal he had with Tricky Stewart at the time.
“I’m working with a n-gga that literally is about to change my life, even though I was in my horrible, horrible, horrible publishing situation with Tricky so I never got a publishing check off of any Drake songs,” he told Vlad TV last year.

“I never got a single publishing check off any songs. I had to feed my family off getting paid under the table in that situation, because Tricky and them wouldn’t let me go. I didn’t get out that deal ’til 2019, 2020; I signed [it in] 2011. I had to let go of a lot of shit just to get out.”
