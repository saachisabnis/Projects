Reign Disick was not happy with the paparazzi on Friday evening.
The 9-year-old was photographed flipping off the cameras as he exited Nobu in Malibu, Calif. with his father Scott Disick and family by his side. 
Reign and Scott stepped out to eat with sister Penelope and cousin North West. Reign wore a green hoodie and a pair of blue jeans. 
The “Kardashians” star hit the paparazzi with the crude gesture shortly before he and his family hopped inside their vehicle as they left. 
He also performed the same gesture at his cousin Dream’s 7th birthday party last year. Though, instead of flipping off the paparazzi, he gave the piñata the bird when he couldn’t break the candy-filled sculpture. 
The move is hardly shocking for Reign, who’s been known to show paparazzi his middle finger many times before — even in 2019, when he was just four years old, according to Yahoo! 
Reign also pulled the same move last June at Nobu in Malibu where he celebrated Father’s Day with his dad and his older siblings Mason and Penelope.
Disick and his children celebrated the holiday in the same fashion this year, per TMZ. 
Kardashian was called out by her fans for not including her ex Scott in her Father’s Day post last month as she celebrated her husband Travis Barker, months after she welcomed their first child together, Rocky Thirteen Barker, in November. 
“Beyond grateful for the Dad that you are to our baby boy, and all of our kids,” she captioned the post, tagging only Barker. 
Scott and the Poosh founder share Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign together. 
“What about scott? ‘Grateful for the dad that you are to ALL of our kids?’ these kids have a father, he’s [sic] name is Scott,” a fan wrote under the post. 
Kardashian and Barker blended their families when they married in May 2022. 
Barker is also father to Landon, 20, and Alabama Barker, 18, whom he shares with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler.
