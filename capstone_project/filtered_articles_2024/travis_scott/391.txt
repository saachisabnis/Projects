It’s been a big week over at MLB Pipeline.
We updated the Top 100 Prospects list, the Top 30s for each organization and the Top 10s for every position. We’ve also reranked the 30 farm systems, headlined by a new organization at No. 1.

It’s a lot to dig into. To help fans of specific clubs, we’ve provided a snapshot of each organization below. That includes its farm system ranking, total amount of prospects in the Top 100, total of Prospect Points (100 for No. 1 overall, 99 for No. 2, etc.) and Prospect Point rank.
Jump to: AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West
Blue JaysSystem rank: 24th | Top 100: 0 | Prospect Points: 0 (28th/tie)The Blue Jays’ system was trending downward due to multiple pitching injuries – most notably to Ricky Tiedemann’s elbow leading to Tommy John surgery – and Orelvis Martinez’s PED suspension. But the organization buoyed that trend with savvy moves at the Deadline, including the pickup of Jake Bloss from the Astros in the Yusei Kikuchi deal, and the nice addition of Trey Yesavage at No. 20 overall in the first round of the Draft. The depth is better now than it was, but Toronto still lacks a Top 100 prospect right now, though Martinez, Yesavage or even 2023 first-rounder Arjun Nimmala could become one in time. More »

OriolesSystem rank: 3rd | Top 100: 3 | Prospect Points: 281 (6th)The Orioles’ reign as the top farm system ended after six straight rankings at No. 1 because of graduations and some trades, but there’s still a lot of talent here, starting with three players in the top 11 of our Top 100. Several players lower on the list have stepped forward -- pitchers who have touched the big leagues (Cade Povich and Chayce McDermott) and others a bit further away, like Juan Nuñez and outfielder Stiven Martinez -- to help solidify this list.

RaysSystem rank: 1st | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 325 (3rd)The Rays are one of two clubs with four Top 50 overall prospects in Junior Caminero, Carson Williams, Xavier Isaac and Brayden Taylor, giving the organization a promising foundation already. But then they built around that by being an aggressive seller at the Trade Deadline and made a deep system even deeper with additions like Aidan Smith, Brody Hopkins and Dylan Lesko. The next great homegrown Rays contender should come from this base of prospects. More »

Red SoxSystem rank: 7th | Top 100: 5 | Prospect Points: 320 (5th)The Red Sox have one of the formidable prospect trios in the game in shortstop Marcelo Mayer, outfielder Roman Anthony and catcher Kyle Teel, who all got promoted to Triple-A on Monday -- and breakout second baseman/outfielder/shortstop Kristian Campbell may not be far behind. Boston's extremely hitter-heavy system is getting even more one-sided with the addition of first-round pick Braden Montgomery and the emergence of young international shortstops Franklin Arias and Yoeilin Cespedes.

YankeesSystem rank: 18th | Top 100: 1 | Prospect Points: 84 (24th)While Jasson Domínguez is bouncing back well from Tommy John surgery, most of the Yankees' top position prospects (including Spencer Jones and George Lombard Jr.) are having rough years at the plate. New York continually gets the best out of pitchers and spent its first seven picks on college arms in July, beginning with Southeastern Conference right-handers Ben Hess, Bryce Cunningham and Thatcher Hurd.

GuardiansSystem rank: 4th | Top 100: 6 | Prospect Points: 257 (9th)The Guardians made the biggest improvement in our farm system rankings, moving from No. 19 in March to No. 4. They spent a record $20.4 million on the Draft, which hauled in the best pure hitter available in Travis Bazzana and several talented high school pitchers led by Braylon Doughty. Young position players such as outfielder Jaison Chourio, first baseman Ralphy Velazquez and infielder Angel Genao have earned Top 100 prospect status this year, allowing Cleveland to tie for the most players (six) on that list.

RoyalsSystem rank: 25th | Top 100: 2 | Prospect Points: 128 (20th/tie)The Royals have done well with their last two first-round picks, taking powerful catcher Blake Mitchell last year and famed Florida slugger Jac Caglianone sixth overall this summer. The club seems open to the latter’s two-way chances, but the idea of both flexing atop the system for years to come is an intriguing one for a system that’s lacked a star prospect since Bobby Witt Jr. graduated. Nice steps forward by Carter Jensen, Noah Cameron and Steven Zobac are additional causes for optimism, but the lack of ceiling outside the top two spots is notable. More »

TwinsSystem rank: 2nd | Top 100: 6 | Prospect Points: 321 (4th)The Twins are one of five teams with six players in the Top 100 and three of them are in the Top 25. They continue to be very good at finding talent from all arenas, from first-round picks to big international signees, but also in later rounds, especially on the mound. This is a very deep system.

TigersSystem rank: 6th | Top 100: 5 | Prospect Points: 332 (2nd)Max Clark and Jackson Jobe have solidified their standings as top 10 overall prospects in 2024, while middle infielder Kevin McGonigle was one of the highest climbers on our in-season Top 100, considering he was off the preseason edition entirely. Shortstop Bryce Rainer joins the mix as arguably the best prep player in this year’s Draft class, and catcher Thayron Liranzo was a solid addition as a Trade Deadline acquisition. The year hasn’t gone as planned in the Majors, but there are reasons for optimism on the Detroit farm. More »

White SoxSystem rank: 11th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 266 (8th)Though the White Sox are tied for the second-most organization Top 30 prospects acquired via trade (11), the three jewels of their farm system are recent first-rounders Noah Schultz (2022), Colson Montgomery (2021) and Hagen Smith (2024). Their best trade pickups were catcher Edgar Quero and righty Jairo Iriarte. More »

AngelsSystem rank: 29th | Top 100: 2 | Prospect Points: 46 (27th)In the last month alone, the Angels have made some serious renovations to their system, starting with first-round pick Christian Moore, who is already looking like he’s ready to be the next in line in this organization to make it to the big leagues in a hurry. He joins Caden Dana, one of the more intriguing young pitching prospects in the game, in the Top 100. The Draft added five new names to this list and they also added five more, headlined by right-hander George Klassen in Deadline deals. More »

AstrosSystem rank: 30th | Top 100: 0 | Prospect Points: 0 (28th/tie)The Astros continually rank at or near the bottom of our system rankings, yet they keep winning (seven straight American League Championship Series appearances) and producing guys who get Rookie of the Year votes (at least one in each of the past five seasons). Their best three prospects are outfielder Jacob Melton (2022), catcher Walker Janek (2024) and infielder Brice Matthews (2023) -- their highest picks who remain in the organization from each of the past three Drafts.

A’sSystem rank: 22nd | Top 100: 2 | Prospect Points: 131 (18th/tie)We can’t wait for Jack Wilson to get back and continue showing his ridiculous feel for making contact plays in the big leagues. Now he’s joined by Nick Kurtz, the club’s first-rounder this year, who could be the next college hitter to move quickly through the system. Their overall Draft class was pretty solid and the A's brought in 10 new names for the Top 30 between the Draft and the Trade Deadline. More »

MarinersSystem rank: 9th | Top 100: 6 | Prospect Points: 271 (7th)The Mariners are one of five teams with six Top 100 guys, and they’re all hitters. A half-dozen exciting bats are making their way up the system, with five of the six 21 years old or younger. After focusing on young hitting lately, they added a pair of exciting arms (Jurrangelo Cijntje and Ryan Sloan) early on in this year’s Draft to make this list even more robust. More »

RangersSystem rank: 26th | Top 100: 1 | Prospect Points: 63 (25th)Infielder Sebastian Walcott and right-handers Emiliano Teodo and Winston Santos are the best of 12 international signees on the Rangers' Top 30, the second-highest total in baseball. Pitchers besides Teodo and Santos also are on the rise, with Kumar Rocker making a strong comeback from Tommy John surgery, 2023 fifth-rounder Alejandro Rosario breaking out and Jack Leiter showing improvement at Triple-A.

BravesSystem rank: 27th | Top 100: 0 | Prospect Points: 0 (28th/tie)While the Braves don’t currently have any Top 100 players, the top of their Top 30 is still very intriguing in terms of sheer upside on the mound. All of the top three -- former Top 100 guys AJ Smith-Shawver and Hurston Waldrep as well as the new No. 1, first-rounder Cam Caminiti -- have the chance to climb back onto the list. It’s still a pitching-rich system, with seven of the top 10 making their living on the bump. More »

MarlinsSystem rank: 15th | Top 100: 3 | Prospect Points: 110 (22nd)The Marlins have done a much better job recently developing pitchers compared to hitters, and their three best prospects are a trio of arms who cost them $15.3 million and three premium Draft picks: left-hander Thomas White and right-handers Max Meyer and Noble Meyer. First-year president of baseball operations Peter Bendix has acquired 11 Top 30 prospects in the past three months, highlighted by second baseman Connor Norby, catcher Agustin Ramirez and corner infielder Deyvison De Los Santos.

MetsSystem rank: 13th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 142 (16th)Injuries have been the story of the system for the Mets in 2024 with Jett Williams (wrist), Drew Gilbert (hamstring) and Ronny Mauricio (ACL) missing much, if not all, of the season. Luckily, 2023 second-rounder Brandon Sproat’s breakout has been a positive focus, and developments on the bump from Nolan McLean and Jonah Tong have been additional bright spots. More »

NationalsSystem rank: 10th | Top 100: 3 | Prospect Points: 131 (18th/tie)James Wood’s arrival in D.C. could be a promising turning point in the recent history of the franchise, and there’s more where he came from. 2023 No. 2 overall pick Dylan Crews and 2021 first-rounder Brady House are showing promising signs at Triple-A, and high-ceiling arms Travis Sykora and Jarlin Susana are enjoying breakout campaigns at the lower levels. A fairly deep Draft class and a couple nice Trade Deadline pickups give Washington a well-rounded system, even after it lost Wood to graduation. More »

PhilliesSystem rank: 16th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 192 (11th)All three of the Phillies’ active Top 100 players have earned promotions up a level this season, always an encouraging sign. The return of Andrew Painter from Tommy John surgery in 2025 will provide another huge boost and they managed to help the parent club out without giving up any of their big names. Adding young hitters Dante Nori and Griffin Burkholder from this year’s Draft to the top 10 helps this system bolster the up arrow next to its name. More »

BrewersSystem rank: 17th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 165 (14th)Since Jackson Chourio officially graduated, Milwaukee may not have anyone to replace his high-ceiling status in the system, but as tends to be the case here, there is a nice mix of popup producers (Cooper Pratt, Luke Adams, Jesus Made) and special tools (Jeferson Quero’s glove, Jacob Misiorowski’s fastball). Even without a top-40 overall talent, the Brewers have depth and enough names with breakout potential for 2025 that they could make their stay in the bottom half of the farm system rankings a short one.

CardinalsSystem rank: 19th | Top 100: 3 | Prospect Points: 147 (15th)West Virginia middle infielder JJ Wetherholt was a legit candidate to go first overall in July but fell to the Cardinals at No. 7, giving them a potential star at the top of the system. Quinn Mathews, a fourth-rounder in 2022, has been St. Louis’ breakout story of the summer with improved velocity that pushed him from Single-A to Double-A, and Tink Hence still shows massive potential in flashes. Steps back by Thomas Saggese, Victor Scott II and Tekoah Roby take away some of that shine. More »

CubsSystem rank: 8th | Top 100: 6 | Prospect Points: 336 (1st)The Cubs not only are tied for the lead with six Top 100 Prospects but all six are one step away from Wrigley Field in Triple-A: infielder Matt Shaw, right-hander Cade Horton, outfielders Owen Caissie and Kevin Alcántara, catcher/first baseman Moises Ballesteros and second baseman/outfielder James Triantos. They have perhaps the most top-heavy system in the game and not much in the way of premium arms. More »

PiratesSystem rank: 20th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 128 (20th/tie)Any system is going to take a hit when it loses the best pitching prospect of a generation from its rankings. The positive side of that, of course, is that Paul Skenes is dominating in the big leagues. Jared Jones’ graduation hurt/helped on that front as well, so while this system is a little lighter, guys like Bubba Chandler have stepped up to continue to provide excitement, especially on the mound. First-rounder Konnor Griffin and second-round Wyatt Sanford could provide a huge boost as well. More »

RedsSystem rank: 14th | Top 100: 4 | Prospect Points: 188 (12th)It’s not a good time for pitching prospects, with only 11 arms in the overall Top 50. But the Reds have two of them, both in the top 35, with the Reds using their last two first-rounders to bring in Rhett Lowder and Chase Burns. It’s a young Top 30 overall, with five of the Reds’ top 10 still teenagers, so there could be a lot more good times to come here. More »

D-backsSystem rank: 21st | Top 100: 2 | Prospect Points: 101 (23rd)Four of Arizona’s top 10 prospects (Jordan Lawlar, Tommy Troy, Yu-Min Lin, Gino Groover) have been affected by injuries this season, while 2022 first-rounder Druw Jones has thankfully stayed on the field for much of his second full season after dealing with his own issues last year. Right-hander Yilber Diaz used an improved slider to push for MLB time, and Demetrio Crisantes and Adrian Del Castillo became must-follow bats. Top 2024 picks Slade Caldwell and Ryan Waldschmidt give Arizona its best chances at building out a deeper Top 100 group in ‘25 and beyond. More »

DodgersSystem rank: 5th | Top 100: 5 | Prospect Points: 183 (13th)No organization combines winning and development like the Dodgers, who are headed to the postseason for the 12th straight year and have seen outfielder Josue De Paula, right-hander River Ryan, shortstop Alex Freeland and left-hander Jackson Ferris ascend to Top 100 prospect status this summer. They also may have the most impressive collection of teenage talent in the game, led by shortstops Joendry Vargas, Emil Morales and Kellon Lindsey and outfielders Eduardo Quintero, Zyhir Hope and Ching-Hsien Ko.

GiantsSystem rank: 23rd | Top 100: 3 | Prospect Points: 62 (26th)Though the Giants have gotten little production from their first-round selections since scoring with Tim Lincecum, Madison Bumgarner, Buster Posey and Zack Wheeler from 2006-09, they're hoping first baseman Bryce Eldridge (2023) and outfielder James Tibbs III (2024) will end that drought. San Francisco signed each of its eight best prospects the past two years: Eldridge, right-hander Hayden Birdsong, Tibbs, left-handers Carson Whisenhunt and Joe Whitman, outfielders Dakota Jordan and Rayner Arias and shortstop Walker Martin.

PadresSystem rank: 28th | Top 100: 2 | Prospect Points: 135 (17th)The San Diego list has a different look after the club dealt 12 of its top 21 prospects since MLB Pipeline's preseason rankings, but there are two still big names up top in Ethan Salas and Leodalis De Vries -- the top two talents from the last pair of international signing classes. A deep 2024 Draft class headlined by prep lefties Kash Mayfield and Boston Bateman built out the farm a bit more, and by continually making big moves at the MLB level, the Padres like to wager they can develop some of their current Minor Leaguers into bigger names.

RockiesSystem rank: 12th | Top 100: 6 | Prospect Points: 205 (10th)This system has made a nice jump with two top 10 picks in a row certainly helping: Charlie Condon and Chase Dollander are in the top 25 overall. The 2023 Draft class has had a very solid first full year of pro ball overall and many of the Rockies’ Top 30 have performed well in 2024. There could be more jumps to come if Zac Veen’s resurgence continues, Yanquiel Fernandez keeps developing and Adael Amador can hit the reset button. More »
