Kourtney and Travis welcomed their son Rocky back in November, with a source telling PEOPLE at the time, "Kourtney is over the moon about her son’s arrival. Her pregnancy took a stressful turn towards the end. She is happy to be able to snuggle her baby boy now. She feels so blessed."
On last week’s episode of The Kardashians, the Poosh founder opened up about the emergency fetal surgery she had to undergo before the birth of her son.
"A couple months ago, we had a terrifying scare where I had to have emergency fetal surgery," she said in a confessional.

The scene then switched to the mom recovering from the surgery. "Baby Rocky had to have fetal surgery for fluid in his lung," she said.
"And it's super rare, that this [is] the condition that he had but it's also super rare and lucky that we caught it,” she added. “ And thank you, God, for this successful surgery. I'm honestly just so grateful, I have no words."

Kardashian went on to say that she was fearful after the surgery, adding that the fluid started to come back.
However, after watching a documentary about how thinking can affect one’s health, she began shifting her thoughts.
‘I started talking to the baby every day, saying my prayers, and after I had that mindset shift,” she said. “The fluid was completely gone and we had not one single problem after."
