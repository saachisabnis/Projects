WWE struck a deal with Netflix to move its flagship program, Monday Night RAW, from the USA Network to the streaming platform starting in January 2025.
The inaugural episode is expected to be packed, featuring appearances from legends, including John Cena.
There is also a possibility that Travis Scott will appear during the episode.
Triple H and Scott have recently posted photos together on social media. Scott was backstage at a RAW event held in Houston, TX earlier this year.
WrestleVotes is reporting that Scott’s team is discussing with WWE the possibility of the famed rapper appearing on the RAW-Netflix premiere episode.
The report states, “There have been some preliminary high-level discussions to have rap superstar Travis Scott appear on the first Monday Night Raw on Netflix from Los Angeles on January 6. Of course, Scott and the WWE have a strong relationship, as he and Rey Mysterio appeared together at Fanatics Fest this past summer in New York City. In addition, WWE will have a presence at the upcoming Complex Con event in Las Vegas, which features Travis Scott among other musical icons. TC, it is worth noting that his song FE!N has been used in all the promotional material for Wrestlemania 41, so WWE is looking to go down this route, the route of bringing in some heavy mainstream names for Netflix debut, and they don’t get much bigger in the pop culture world than Travis Scott.”
