 Travis Barker's ex-wife, Shanna Moakler, dubbed him a 'womaniser' and accused his new wife Kourtney Kardashian of disrupting their family. 
Shanna and Travis, who were married between 2004 and 2008, have two kids together, Alabama Barker and Landon Barker.
Ruffling feathers, the former beauty queen didn't hold back in slating her ex-husband and reality star Kourtney. Travis tied the knot with Kourtney in May 2022 and the couple welcomed their little boy, Rocky Thirteen, after announcing Kourtney's pregnancy last year.
Custody of Kourtney's three children from her past relationship with Scott Disick is shared between herself and Scott. Their brood includes son's Mason and Reign and daughter Penelope.
Hopping on to Bunnie XO's "Dumb Blonde" podcast recently, Shanna, still annoyed about her split from Travis over 16 years ago, had word or two to say about him. She claimed about her Blink-182 ex: "He did me pretty dirty", she added: "His womanising, his addiction."
In the past, Travis has openly discussed his drug addictions, sharing how being the lone survivor of a plane crash served as a wake-up call. He admitted to abusing drugs and marijuana before seeing his friends die in the crash, which made him quit.
Moakler also voiced strong opinions about her ex-husband's current wife, Kourtney Kardashian, and her family. In her words, she blasted: "F**k you, that family. You're disgusting. I removed myself so that they couldn't bond with my children over hating me."
Further, she conveyed to her kids: "Go do what you guys need to do and when you're ready, I will be here loving you unconditionally. And I will be here as your mother, and I will wait. And that's what I did." 
She also mentioned: "When Travis got with Kourtney, there was some parental alienation going on there, where Travis - even when we weren't together - always wanted to be the 'super dad'. I'm the best parent. I'm the this and that, and I'm like, 'bro, you win.' Like, you're the winner here. You have all the money and you have all this. You're the winner."
She then criticised the reality TV show featuring the Kardashians and Barker: "I'm tired of people s******g on me. There are people that don't like that family, don't watch their f****** show and don't give a f*** what Kim [Kardashian] is doing with her a**."
