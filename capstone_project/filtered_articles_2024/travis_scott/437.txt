Today from 6-8pm, Travis Scott’s Cactus Jack Foundation will host a Hurricane Beryl Relief Drive in conjunction with the Houston Food Bank to support the communities in Texas devastated by the storm. Hurricane Beryl caused severe flooding, widespread power outages affecting nearly 3 million homes and businesses, and resulted in the tragic loss of at least eight lives. The relief drive will distribute essential goods through a drive-through distribution, operating on a first-come, first-serve basis. Cactus Jack Foundation spokesperson and Scott’s sister, Jordan Webster, will be on-site to support this effort.
Location: Thurgood Marshall High School (1220 Buffalo Run, Missouri City, TX 77489)
