Kourtney Kardashian donned a sweet and subtle tribute to her blended family with her husband, Travis Barker, while celebrating her 45th birthday.
The Poosh founder recently shared some photos of her birthday celebration on her Instagram Stories, and eagle-eyed fans noticed a sweet connection one of her accessories had with her and the blink-182 drummer's kids, per Page Six. In one photo where Kardashian is being presented with a birthday cake topped with candles, her simple silver necklace is on display with the letter charms "ALTKMPRR" that feature the initial for the couple and their children. 
Kardashian is mother to three children with her ex Scott Disick, 14-year-old Mason, 11-year-old Penelope and 9-year-old Reign. Barker shares two children with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, 20-year-old Landon and 18-year-old Alabama. He has also remained close to his former stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya, Moakler's 25-year-old daughter with Oscar De La Hoya. Kardashian and Barker also welcomed their first child together in November 2023, a son named Rocky. 
Kardashian belatedly celebrated her birthday surrounded by friends and family in a special pancake breakfast at IHOP complete with a "KOURT X IHOP" mug collection, days after she managed to clap back at haters and body shamers who have criticized her appearance following the birth of baby Rocky.
