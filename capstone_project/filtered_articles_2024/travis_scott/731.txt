Lil Baby has found himself in more legal trouble after getting arrested for illegal weapon possession.
According to TMZ, the Atlanta rapper (real name Dominique Jones) was handcuffed by Las Vegas police on Monday night (August 26) after he was allegedly caught carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, which is a felony offense.

Baby, 29, was subsequently booked into the Clark County Detention Center where he was held on a $5,000 bond.
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has yet to reveal further details about the alleged crime, although Baby’s attorneys Drew Findling and David Chesnoff have issued a statement about his arrest.

“To be clear, Dominique Jones has a valid Georgia Carrying a Concealed Weapon (CCW) Permit,” they told TMZ. “On his behalf, we are actively investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding his arrest in Las Vegas.”
UPDATE: Cops say Lil Baby was “seen on video being passed a gun” at the nightclub Encore, per TMZ. Following a police investigation, he was arrested for carrying a concealed firearm without a permit as Nevada does not recognize Carry Concealed Weapon permits issued in Georgia.
Lil Baby was in town celebrating James Harden‘s 35th birthday, with the NBA star hosting a party at the popular nightclub Drai’s that was also attended by Travis Scott, Chris Brown and Kevin Durant.

A viral video from the night also showed Baby generously tipping the staff of Mexican restaurant Toca Madera $11,000.
It’s unclear if he was arrested before or after the celebrations.
Lil Baby’s brush with the law comes shortly after he offered a promising update on his new album.
In an Instagram post over the weekend, the “We Paid” hitmaker revealed that his next project is “80 percent done” and also apologized to fans for the wait.

The as-yet-untitled album will serve as Baby’s first full-length release in two years, following up 2022’s It’s Only Us.
Boasting appearances from the likes of Future, Young Thug and Nardo Wick, that project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 216,000 equivalent sales in its first week, marking a new high for Lil Baby.

However, the album was met with mixed reviews — especially compared to the largely glowing reception to his previous effort, 2020’s My Turn — earning a 3.5 out of 5 score from HipHopDX.
