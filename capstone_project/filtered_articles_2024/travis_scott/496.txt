Update: After several delays, it’s finally time for Travis Scott and Jordan Brand to drop the “Mocha” colorway of the Jordan Jumpman Jack. The long-awaited pair sees a classic Scott color scheme of brown and black make an appearance across his first signature shoe with the Jumpman team. Its design, as described several times below, is accompanied by special packaging that includes a co-branded box and carrying bag. Release is now set to take place on November 26 in full family sizing via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a starting price of $200 USD.
Update: Travis Scott’s Jordan Jumpman Jack in “Mocha” will be experiencing a short delay as it moves its release date to November 13 from its original schedule of October 4.
Update: As Travis Scott continues to rollout the Jordan Jumpman Jack in a wide variety of colorways, we have another look at the “Mocha” colorway. Last spotted in May, our latest preview of the kicks is delivered via an on-foot breakdown by YankeeKicks. The black and brown color arrangement stands out as the darkest iteration of the shoe that we’ve seen, and is now expected to drop on October 4 via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a price of $200 USD.

Update: After appearing for the first time last week, Travis Scott’s Jordan Jumpman Jack “Mocha” has again surfaced. Our latest look at the sneaker highlights its mixed material build in the brown and black color arrangement. While previously noted as appearing in light blue, the outsole’s “JACK” text looks to be white in this batch of images. No details regarding its release date have been disclosed just yet to stay tuned for updates as we expect it to land on shelves by the end of the year via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a price of $200 USD.

Original Story: Travis Scott’s first signature shoe with Jordan Brand, the Jordan Jumpman Jack, finally saw its first proper release via the Nike SNKRS platform earlier this week in “Sail and Dark Mocha.” However, there’s plenty more in store for the silhouette as new colorways like the recently-spotted off-white pair continue to surface. Adding to the list today is a “Mocha” version that leans on the familiar brown hue once again.
Spotted in the Instagram post that is embedded below, our first look at this “Mocha” iteration showcases the chocolate brown hue across its suede overlays that run throughout the shoe’s upper. From there, a canvas base returns to the shoe in black, matching the tongue, laces, the lateral reverse Swoosh and the sole unit. Its typical branding elements return to the shoe, though what rests at it’s heel is currently unknown, while the outsole’s “JACK” text takes on a bright blue hue to round things out.
At the time of writing, neither Travis Scott nor Jordan Brand have announced the release of the Jordan Jumpman Jack in this “Mocha” colorway. Stay tuned for updates, including an official breakdown of the sneaker, as it’s currently expected to land on shelves later this year via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a starting price of $200 USD.
