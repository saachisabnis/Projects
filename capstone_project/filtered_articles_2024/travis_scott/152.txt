Capitalizing on the popularity and success of his recent Days Before Rodeo rollout, Travis Scott‘s fans prove to be still excited about the almost decade-old mixtape. Noting the immense buzz and excitement surrounding the album, Scott has now reached back into the vault to drop unreleased projects.
Amongst those was a new “vault edition” of the album titled Live From Atlanta. Scott has now dropped a live recording of the Days Before Rodeo concert, exclusively on his website. The live album is being packaged with the standard edition of the Days Before Rodeo and available as a digital download for $4.99 USD. The album is derived from Scott’s highly anticipated Days Before Rodeo concert album he had last week, where he gave hardcore fans a treat when he performed the entire mixtape. The tracklist is similar to the album, except for its order, where Scott changed things up for the live performance. 
The new live album was announced on the Cactus Jack Instagram. Those who want to purchase Live From Atlanta album can visit Travis Scott’s online shop.
