Lil Yachty has reached a new high as two of his albums have exceeded half a million each in sales units.
On Friday (March 8), the Recording Industry Association of America certified the rapper and singer’s 2016 debut Lil Boat and its 2018 sequel Lil Boat 2 gold.

This accolade by the trade organization honors 500,000 album sales or equivalent units, which both packages have surpassed separately since their releases via Quality Control and Motown Records.
The original Lil Boat put the Atlanta artist on the map. Its follow-up two years later debuted at No. 2 on the US Billboard chart, marking him as a full-fledged star.
Yachty isn’t the only artist to get RIAA hardware recently. Last month, SZA  got seven new gold and platinum certifications for songs released as part of 2022’s SOS.
“Open Arms” featuring Travis Scott, “Seek & Destroy” and Ghost In The Machine” featuring Phoebe Bridgers all reached platinum status for the first time (meaning each cut sold over 1,000,000 units), whereas “I Hate U” and “Snooze” went three and four times platinum respectively. Most notably, “Good Days” attained 6x platinum status.

Additionally, “Conceited” has been certified gold, with 500,000 units sold.
Prior to that, Twista’s classic “Slow Jamz” finally achieved platinum certification, just a few days after its 20th anniversary. The track was officially honored with the award in late January.

On the same day, “Overnight Celebrity” and Kamikaze also went double platinum as well. The latter went platinum the first time back in 2004, soon after its release.
Twista has been a staple within the Hip Hop community for the best part of 35 years. Speeding out the gate in the early ’90s with his mesmerizing, rapid-fire flow — which in 1992 earned him the title of World’s Fastest Rapper, according to the Guinness Book of World Records — he took the underground by storm before kicking things into overdrive, thanks to his show-stealing guest verse on Do Or Die‘s 1996 Rap-A-Lot Records classic “Po Pimp.”

This breakthrough set the scene for the success that would come with the Chicago rapper’s platinum-selling third studio album, Adrenaline Rush. By his own admission, the 1997 LP established him as “a real rapper” and helped validate rappers from his hometown.
“It meant you had to accept that artists from Chicago could spit,” he told HipHopDX.

Despite the accolades that came at the hands of Adrenaline Rush, it was his 2004 album Kamikaze that catapulted Twista into a whole other stratosphere — and probably a whole new tax bracket, too.
