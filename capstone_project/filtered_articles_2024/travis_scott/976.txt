Scott Disick made sure his son Mason’s 15th birthday was one to remember by gifting him his first car: a Mercedes-Benz “Mini” G-Class Wagon.
“Happy birthday big boy! Felt like it was only fair 4 you 2 get your first G wagon even if it’s a mini g wagon it’s still a wagon! Love u son!!!!!! Let the good times roll,” Disick, 41, wrote via his Instagram Story on Saturday, December 14, alongside a photo of the new car with a big black bow on it.
In follow-up posts, the reality star — who shares Mason, 12-year-old daughter Penelope and 10-year-old son Reign with ex Kourtney Kardashian — gave a glimpse at the car from other angles, writing, “Happy birthday!!!! Mini g wagon g wagon g wagon.”
The Benz was parked next to Disick’s collection of luxury vehicles as he shared, “Gotta be the coolest little wagon I have ever seen! You deserve every inch of it! Love you more then [sic] anything in life.”
Disick also celebrated his youngest son Reign’s 10th birthday on Saturday. (Mason and Reign are both born on December 14.) The Kardashians star took Reign to the Los Angeles Rams’ Week 14 matchup against the Buffalo Bills at SoFi Stadium on December 8.
“Had 2 much fun with you at your first game you asked me to take you to and I don’t even like sports,” Disick shared in another Instagram Story post, which featured a photo of the pair at the game. “That’s when you know you realy [sic] love your kid! Just kidding love u more then [sic] life young blood,  happy bday son!”
Disick and Kardashian, 45, were together from 2006 to 2015 before officially calling it quits. The former couple now successfully coparent their kids alongside Kardashian’s husband, Travis Barker, with whom she shares 12-month-old son Rocky.
“My birthday boys. So special to me it hurts my heart,” Kourtney wrote on Instagram on Saturday alongside a carousel of throwback photos of Mason and Reign.
Her sisters Kim Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian commented on the post.
“I still can’t believe they are born on the same day ❤️❤️❤️,” Khloé, 40, wrote, with Kim, 44, adding, “Happy Birthday Mason and Reign. I love youuuuuuu.”
Grandma Kris Jenner also celebrated the birthday boys on Instagram, sharing photos and a sweet post about their shared day.
