Exciting Sneaker Collaborations and Retro Releases Highlight the Holiday Season's Massive Lineup

According to Sneaker News, the upcoming holiday season and the overlap with the NBA schedule bring an extensive lineup of new sneaker releases, marking perhaps the largest release slate in this series’ current run.
Starting with collaborations, several notable partnerships lead the way. Notre and Vans revisit their collaboration with new iterations of the SK8 Hi and Rowley XLT. CP Company lends a unique perspective to adidas' SPZL collection, and CLOT continues its work with adidas on the Gazelle. Meanwhile, LeBron James’ latest signature shoe pays homage to Monopoly, and Travis Scott introduces the “Mocha” edition of his Jumpman Jack line.
In Air Jordans, the Air Jordan 39 returns in a “UNC” theme after a hiatus, while the Tatum 3 reflects classic motifs. The lineup also features two retro releases: the Air Jordan 11 “Bred Velvet” and the Air Jordan 4 “Fear.” Elsewhere, notable releases include the KD 17 “Aunt Pearl,” a new take on the Air Max Waffle Racer, and the Nike Air Max TL 2.5 reissue.
For those looking to stay on top of this full range of upcoming drops, individual articles for each release provide in-depth information, complete with pick-up links and detailed coverage
