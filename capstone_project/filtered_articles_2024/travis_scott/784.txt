The 49th Assembly District covers all of Crawford County and most of Grant County in the southwestern corner of Wisconsin.
Nov 6, 2024, 2:25 AM CST
WISCONSIN (Civic Media) – Incumbent Republican Travis Tranel has been called the winner of the race for the 49th Assembly District in Wisconsin.
The Associated Press made the call Tuesday evening.
The Republican Party was favored in this district going into the election, according to CNalysis. The district was considered very likely Republican with a projected margin of 14 points.
Tranel, who was first elected to the Assembly in 2010, serves on three committees, including as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture. He is a small business owner and dairy farmer from Cuba City.
Tranel defeated Democratic challenger Scott Walker (not the former governor), a doctor who runs a medical clinic.
The 49th Assembly District covers all of Crawford County and most of Grant County in the southwestern corner of Wisconsin.
