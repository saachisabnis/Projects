Reality star Scott Disick just shared a rare photo on social media alongside his eldest son, Mason Disick.
Disick posted the heartwarming moment with Mason, 14, on his Instagram account on Tuesday, July 23. The Kardashians star snapped a selfie of him and his son enjoying a plane ride together, with Scott captioning it, "Young blood knocked on the way home. Best friend 4 life." In the picture, Scott is dressed casually and wearing sunglasses, leaning on Mason, who appears to be sleeping.
Fans loved seeing the photo of the father-son duo, quickly leaving a bunch of comments. "Such a great father! This kids are being raised in such a great environment. Good for you Scott!!" noted one fan, while another seemingly shared the same sentiment, saying, "Always been a Scott fan! He's real, he's genuine, he's funny, he's got great energy 🔥."
Other fans wished to see the 41-year-old more on tv, saying things like, "Scott & Khloe need their own show!! They're hilarious together 😂," and, "I don't watch KUWTK anymore. No Scott , no fun."
Mason, who has seemingly chosen to lead a more private life away from the spotlight, launched his own Instagram account in May. Recently, he shared a series of photos with friends, showing off their outfits during outings to a gas station and Nobu in Malibu. He kept his face hidden in most of the photos, except for the last one, which he captioned, "aura."
Scott, on the other hand, opened up about his struggle with weight gain and the "horrible" impact it had on his life before he decided to embark on a wellness journey. In a candid conversation with Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner on the June 6 episode of The Kardashians, he admitted, "I had no idea how horrible it was," and that he was "pounding a whole box" of Hawaiian rolls every night." The father of three has been transparent about his weight fluctuations over the years, particularly after a back injury from a 2022 car accident that significantly contributed to his initial weight gain.
Scott and ex-wife Kourtney Kardashian also share two other children, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9. Additionally, Kourtney welcomed a son named Rocky with her husband, Travis Barker, in November 2023.
