Kai Cenat is set to up his live-streaming game with a 24-hour stream backstage at Travis Scott’s upcoming concert in London. Known for his engaging, hilarious streams and viral moments, Cenat will join Scott at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on July 11, part of Scott’s Circus Maximus tour. Who knows what’s in store for the “chat” but fans of the streamer and Houston rapper are here for it. 
The collab was sparked during one of Cenat’s recent livestreams when Scott called in with the idea: “I got a sold out stadium show. Let’s do 24 hours in London.” Scott continued, “We’ll do it backstage. We’ll go crazy.”
Get this: Scott played a crucial role in Cenat’s success with streaming. After Cenat faced a Twitch ban for guideline violations last year, Scott intervened to help him get reinstated, although the specifics of his assistance remain unclear. Since then, Cenat’s career has thrived.
ICYMI, recently, Cenat made headlines with a sleepover stream featuring Kevin Hart and Druski, following a solo stream with Hart. They called in LeBron James, Rich Paul, and BenDaDon, and the event was filled with drinking, dancing, eating, and endless jokes. Hart even teased Cenat for getting rejected by Tyla on a previous stream, bringing him a poster that read “We Friends Tho.”
Meanwhile, Travis Scott continues to enjoy the success of his 2023 album *Utopia*, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold 496,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. All 19 songs from the album charted on the Hot 100.
Excited for this event. Something tells me other collabs from top creators and major artists are sure to follow.
