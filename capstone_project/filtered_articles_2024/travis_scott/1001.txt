Taylor Swift's father has been accused of attacking a paparazzo who was "aggressively pushing their way" toward the singer.
The "Bad Blood" singer's dad Scott allegedly punched a photographer in Sydney after the Australian leg of her Eras Tour came to an end.
According to TMZ, a man resembling Scott, 71, was walked along a wharf next to someone who appeared to be Taylor, who covered her head and upper body under an umbrella.
A photographer started taking photos, but it's said he was blocked by a man holding an umbrella in front of the camera, and words were then exchanged off camera.
A spokesperson for the NSW Police Force told E! News: "Police have been told a 71-year-old man allegedly assaulted a 51-year-old man at Neutral Bay Wharf.
"The younger man reported the incident and inquiries are now underway by officers."
It was added that the man in question didn't require any medical treatment.
A spokesperson for Taylor has addressed the alleged incident and claimed the photographers were behaving "aggressively."
They told The Daily Mail newspaper: "'Two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water."
Taylor's boyfriend Travis Kelce joined her in Australia last week, and endeared himself to her fans as he was spotted handing out guitar picks to fans.
Footage on social media also showed the Kansas City Chiefs star getting a friendship bracelet from a Taylor fan in exchange for a plectrum.
Also along for the trip was Travis’ dad Ed, who was seen handing out sandwiches from the VIP tent to fans in the middle of Taylor’s show.
Taylor has been paying tribute to Travis in her gigs by changing her lyrics.
At her Sydney show, she pointed to Travis as she sang the line “that’s my man" in her song "Willow" – before changing the words to her tune "Karma" to mention “the guy on the Chiefs."
