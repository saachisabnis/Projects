Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce are revealing the Love Actually character that captured their daughter’s heart.
“The cutest thing about watching was that Ellie was watching at the end of the movie and got blushed on the cheeks,” Kylie, 32, shared on the Tuesday, December 24, episode of the “New Heights” podcast. “She was so excited and the next day, she told me, ‘Mom, that cute boy who played the drums? Will you show me a picture of him?’”
After googling Sam from Love Actually — whose stepfather Daniel is played by Liam Neeson — Kylie found a photo of actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster that left their 3-year-old daughter “giggling.”
“It was very cute,” Kylie added.
In addition to Ellie, Jason, 37, and Kylie are also parents to Wyatt, 5, and 22-month-old Bennett. They are expecting their fourth child in 2025.
When Travis Kelce laughed at the idea of his nieces watching Love Actually at such a young age, Kylie clarified that they didn’t watch every story line play out.
“They only saw the end,” she said with a laugh. “They almost saw the boobs but I warned Jason. He sped it up.”
Released in 2003, Love Actually features nine intertwined stories that examine the complexities of the one emotion that connects all individuals — love. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and the late Alan Rickman are just some of the actors who make up the star-studded cast.
“I think it’s lovely,” Kylie said when sharing her review of the film. “It could be my ADHD that makes me like this movie so much because it’s a bunch of small stories in one big movie and it hops around a lot. That’s helpful for me.”
In comparison, Jason suggested it “might be the worst Christmas movie I’ve ever seen.”
“I don’t even know if it’s up for debate,” he added. “There was zero Christmas spirit.”
Travis, 35, added, “I didn’t feel Christmas at all during the movie. I enjoyed the movie, I just didn’t understand how much it really tied into Christmas.”

When Kylie suggested the movie was more about romance, Jason wasn’t buying it.
“Let me tell you,” he replied. “If Love Actually is about romance, I do not understand romance.”
Luckily, Jason won’t have much time to enjoy any movies on Christmas Day. Instead, the ESPN analyst will likely be watching his brother and the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday, December 25.
