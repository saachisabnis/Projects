A former EMT-Paramedic and Louisiana native from Bayou Chicot , James Dupré joins the show to share the story of his collaboration with Randy Travis that led to the new single, “Where That Came From”; a landmark moment for AI music as it’s perhaps the very first artist-sanctioned commercially released song to feature their own artificially generated voice. Dupré, himself a country singer, had worked with Travis’s longtime producer Kyle Lehning around 2011 to record a demo of the song, co-written by Nashville stalwarts Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill. Dupré’s version was never released, but Lehning gave it a second life more than a decade later: The producer used Dupré’s original vocal as the canvas over which to lay Travis’s AI-generated voice clone.
