Former #Giants OL coach Bobby Johnson finds new landing spot and stays in division. Giants had allowed the second-most sacks (85) in NFL history this season. https://t.co/g0ujEaPIZf
Other staff moves, per sources:* Ryan Kerrigan is back as assistant LBs/Pass Rush specialist* TE coach Todd Storm, OL coaches Travelle Wharton and Juan Castillo are not expected to return
Among those NOT returning, per sources: TEs coach Todd Storm, run game coordinator Juan Castillo, OL coach Travelle Wharton, senior defensive assistant/safeties coach Richard Rodgers.https://t.co/oWRiAqQDBi
Washington Commanders 2024 coaching staff (UPDATED)HC - Dan QuinnOC - Kliff KingsburyDC - Joe Whitt JrSTC - Larry IzzoOL - Bobby JohnsonQBs - Tavita PritchardDPGC - Jason SimmonsPass Rush specialist - Ryan KerriganTBD - Brian JohnsonThoughts?
This Bobby Johnson hire is odd. Dan Quinn’s defense totalled 20 sacks over the 4 games he coached against Johnson’s Giants OL in the last 2 years. Now as Sam Howell proved this year, sacks aren’t necessarily reflective of OL performance, but still concerning
The Giants did run the ball 97 times for 476 yards at 4.9 yards per carry over those four games, for whatever that’s worth. OL coach is a critical hire on any staff but especially this one. Kingsbury known for passing, needs OL coach to help coordinate run game & mesh run/pass
I understand most #Commanders fans are not happy with the Bobby Johnson hire but in Quinn's defense he needed to hire someone with connections to the Giants to complete his NFC East bingo card#HTTC

I’m not trying to be rude or anything, but I do not work for the @Commanders organization or am I an agent, so we will all probably find out together what their plan are for resigning players. I get asked 10 x’s a day every day! @MagicJohnson hasn’t hit me yet  !
Osi took the National football league and made it the international football league  ❤️ this is only the beginning of his legacy there’s a whole generation of athletes to come and their dreams began with him    @OsiUmenyiora https://t.co/xq9F0ewF6s
The #Steelers and QB Mitchell Trubisky have decided to mutually part ways, sources say. The sides spoke to assess the situation and Trubisky, 29, gets a fresh start just over a month ahead of the start of the league year and free agency. pic.twitter.com/FqEFhqcuei
This has to be one of the most unfortunate and unlucky injuries ever. You tore your Achilles coming onto the field   IN the Super Bowl. Devastating. pic.twitter.com/luSI1WXcBe
How on earth was Chris Jones unblocked in OT?Listen to @MikeGolicJr explain what he believes went wrong--and marvel at how the most random things in a SB (like, say, a back-up guard coming in) can swing a game.Pod: https://t.co/25po4Tj9rFYouTube: https://t.co/uRsAEjforA pic.twitter.com/6Uy8pNUN6Z

Multiple #49ers players said after the game that they were not aware of the new overtime rules. The #Chiefs, on the other hand, have been planning for this scenario, and DT Chris Jones said they were going to go for two had San Francisco scored a TD, per @bylindsayhjones.… https://t.co/3p7XzVx6rJ pic.twitter.com/DHe3pn1TwQ
#49ers players saying they didn’t know/were not informed/were not prepared to execute a strategy regarding the playoff overtime rules is blowing my mind…

        : #Chiefs  HC Andy Reid officially confirms that he will be returning to the team in 2024, per @RapSheet Three-peat incoming? pic.twitter.com/RPUj8UqgOU
Craziest part of the KC year- they just won the whole thing without paying the price of organizational attrition. Both OC/DC's back. (in fact, they might bring back EB). Front office returns in full. Meanwhile, Baltimore lost a bunch of key people and didn't win it.
Andy Reid is building a case for greatest coach of all-time.He is one of only four HCs with three or more rings (Gibbs, Noll, Belichick), but out of that group he’s the only one to make Super Bowls with multiple teams while in the free agency era.One more ring might do it tbh
(Forgot Walsh but point still stands)

  HUGE news from Richmond. Senate version of bill to fund new Capitals/Wizards arena in Alexandria dead. Senate Finance has no plans to move forward over concerns about taxpayer money, Gov Youngkin refusal to negotiate. House bill still alive but Senate Dems plan to vote it down https://t.co/C0cMnabn1a
Looks like Ted Leonsis has to spend his own money for a new Virginia arena. Taxpayers have finally wised up to not subsidizing billionaires. Leonsis Land will get done, but not easily, quickly or cheaply.
Dunkin just won the best Super Bowl ad. It’s hysterical, has big name celebs, has cameos that actually add to the ad, and is ridiculously memorable. Perfect in every way.pic.twitter.com/w9OMF6TzHN
