The goal of All aTwitter is to give readers a detailed or quirky look, through the unique lens of Twitter, at the Commanders, the NFL, and sports in general, along with a smattering of other things.  
The Dan Quinn highlights:* "I want to start off by saying clearly -- Jayden Daniels is not injured now."* Believes less practice time ( post-injury, short week) has factored into some bumps* "Hopeful" that Marshon Lattimore this practice this week.
Quinn said they're not surprised by the Lattimore timeline for return. "We knew it was going to be some time where it wasn't plug and play after the trade..." Says Lattimore is a "savage worker" and that the "good news is it's trending in a really strong way."
Dan Quinn said that Jordan Magee hasn't received defensive reps mainly because the guys ahead of him are playing well.Added that he tried to take out Wagner in one game for this reason, and then Wagner proceeded to give the coach side-eye the next two weeks. Ha.

For those asking, the Bengals-Cowboys MNF game is not eligible to be flexed out because of all the drawings, voiceovers and other work that has been done for The Simpsons alt-cast that will air that night.
No Flex Zone: Thanksgiving Day is expected to be Cooper Rush vs. Tommy DeVito
.@Giants general manager Joe Schoen said last week that the language in Daniel Jones’ contract would not factor in and that any benching would be a “football decision.” Today Jones has been benched amid a 2-8 start to the season.@epjackson with more ⤵️https://t.co/U38CiIJY2z
I hope nobody really believes that $250K in possible incentives are the reason Drew Lock isnt starting in NY. Its trying to get to some good will with the fanbase and should give the Giants an easier excuse to demote Jones to 3rd if Lock stays as 2nd.

Now official: The #Cowboys have placed QB Dak Prescott on Injured Reserve. His season is over. pic.twitter.com/9DY1LcjLo7
Daniel Jones just got benched.Dak Prescott is done for the season off undergoing his fourth surgery since 2020 and has a $60 million AAV.  Jalen Hurts is good but has a $51 million AAV.  Washington for the first time in forever has the best QB situation in the NFC East.
A full meniscus repair, which is often the option chosen, would knock Gabe Davis out for the season but is usually best for long-term health. A meniscus trim would likely land Davis on IR, but mean he could return this season. https://t.co/VqBJRiI9QC
#Bengals CB DJ Turner II, who has emerged as a starter this season and was coming into his own, is feared to have suffered a fractured clavicle, sources say. He’s getting a second opinion, but Turner is likely out for the season. pic.twitter.com/750sc387C6

49ers and Rams have 2nd and 3rd-hardest remaining schedule, per FPI. Cardinals: 26th. And Arizona has already beaten them each once (thinking about tiebreakers). https://t.co/12MEpug0bz
One of the most important things about the Bills win over the Chiefs is that it dramatically lowers the likelihood that the Chiefs will be able to sit starters in Weeks 17-18. If the Bills keep winning, the Chiefs can't afford a loss, because the Bills have the tiebreaker.

Evan McPherson has potentially costed the Bengals 3 or 4 wins this season.Lost to KC 26-25: He missed an extra point Lost to Washington 38-33: He missed a FGLost Baltimore 41-38: He missed a FG Lost to the #Chargers 34-27: Missed two FG pic.twitter.com/nG0TUE0K2l
Rather remarkable: Yesterday was the first time in #Jets history that they lost a game in which they scored 25+ pts, had less than 15 penalty yards and committed 0 turnovers.It's happened only 5 times in the NFL since 2000. It was the first this season. h/t ESPN Research.
.@nyjets @BreeceH gains more yards on this checkdown to touchdown than they gained on their first 22 plays of this game. New levels of ineptness. #BaldysBreakdowns pic.twitter.com/DrwfCZ6Pqs

These roughingcalls should either. E reviewable or corrected by replay assistance. Can’t let a textbook hit get flagged. pic.twitter.com/vnsuzFduqV
The Cowboys take the points off the board on the head-slap penalty on the field goal, leave the offense on the field on fourth down and come away with nothing. It’s been that kind of season for them.
Too bad you can make out all the words on this play sheet. Joe Whitt definitely shouldn’t have a quality control guy make notes on every play McCarthy likes in every situation. https://t.co/kndtqGhBv4
I just talked to my mom. She said that she thinks Patrick Mahomes has stopped throwing to Travis Kelce as much as he used to because he's jealous about his fame. I've been picking my brain on why Kelce's production is down and I hadn't even considered that.
