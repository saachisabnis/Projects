Is Travis Scott going to be in Baton Rouge tonight?
Uh ... probably?
A series of cryptic social media posts, alluding to Scott's brand Cactus Jack, have culminated in an announcement that an event is indeed happening at 12 a.m. on April 4Â at the LSU bookstore, 2 Union Square. A post on X, via the Travis Scott-affiliated Circus Maximus account,Â reads "Travis Scott and Michael Rubin Teach Business and Entrepreneurship 101."
"Travis Scott will be popping up at a few schools with Fanatics & Michael Rubin," it also reads. Michael Rubin, retweeting the post on his personal X account, added "@LSU see you at the bookstore on Thursday at midnight with @trvisXX - letâ€™s go ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Fun crew coming!"
LSU's official X handle reposted an accouchement from Travis Scott, in which he said "See u on campus tonight."

Â It's unclear whether Scott and Rubin will appear in person or via streaming. According to the post on X, the pair are scheduled for similar events in Austin and Los Angeles on Thursday.
Scott is a platinum selling musical artist and 10-time Grammy nominee. His latest album, Utopia, was nominated in the Best Rap Album category at this year's Grammy Awards.Â 
Rubin is a billionaire businessman and entrepreneur.
Several LSU spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. However, a bookstore employee said the event was a "kickoff for a Cactus Jack line of clothing."
