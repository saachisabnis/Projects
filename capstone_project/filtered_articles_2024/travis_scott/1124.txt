New is the name of the game for Jordan Brand‘s September slate. 
Through in-line releases and high profile collaboration, an assortment of new Air Jordan sneakers will release throughout November. Travis Scott’s favorite Air Jordan 1 Low will return in a new but familiar colorway, and A Ma Maniére is dropping not one but two new Air Jordan 4s as part of its three-brand 10th anniversary collection. 
In-house, the Air Jordan 12 “Barons” will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Michael Jordan playing baseball, while the Air Jordan 1 Low and High both get new treatments.
