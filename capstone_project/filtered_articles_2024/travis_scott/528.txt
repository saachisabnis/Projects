Travis Scott has made chart history as his decade-old mixtape Days Before Rodeo has climbed to number one on the Billboard 200.
After initially debuting at number two with over 360,000 equivalent units before tumbling down the chart down to number 106, the project has enjoyed a historic surge to the top spot thanks almost entirely to vinyl sales.

According to Billboard, Days Before Rodeo earned 156,000 equivalent units in its fourth week, with 149,000 of that figure comprised of vinyl sales which were made exclusively through the rapper’s website.
It’s the biggest ever sales week for a rap album on vinyl, and the sixth largest across all genres since tracking began in 1991.

Scott previously held the record within Hip Hop with his 2023 album Utopia, which sold 93,000 viny copies in a single week.
Days Before Rodeo, which was made available on streaming services last month following its initial release in 2014, also marks La Flame’s fourth number one on the Billboard 200.

The Houston rapper previously objected to Days Before Rodeo‘s debut chart position, claiming that Billboard had used “unreliable and incomplete” data to place him second behind Sabrina Carpenter’s Short N’ Sweet by a narrow margin.
Scott’s Cactus Jack Records wrote a letter to the publication accusing it of over-weighting Carpenter’s sales through independent stores, but ultimately, Billboard remained firm in their listing, denying claims that their figures were not accurate.
