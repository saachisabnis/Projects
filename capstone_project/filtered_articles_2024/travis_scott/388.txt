The fourth and final day of the Iowa City Spring Sectionals featured the 1500, 100 back, 100 breast, 50 free, and 200 IM.

Travis Gulledge added two more wins for Texas Ford in the 100 breast and 50 freestyle.

The girl’s 50 free was also won by the slimmest of margins, as Emily Kahn from the University of South Dakota got her hand on the 1st in a best time of 26.00. Faith Larsen was just behind in 26.01, which put her just a tenth shy of her best time from December.
In addition to the 50 free, Polyak, a Minnesota recruit, was the runner-up finisher behind Gulledge in the 100 breast. His time of 1:02.00 established a new personal best by over a second, and also took him under the Olympic Trials standard of 1:02.19.
Rounding out Texas Ford’s event winners was 16-year-old Ava Pape, who posted a near best time 2:20.48 to capture the 200 IM.  Finishing just a few tenths behind Pape was 14-year-old Margot Levesque, who knocked three seconds off her personal best time with a 2:20.65.
