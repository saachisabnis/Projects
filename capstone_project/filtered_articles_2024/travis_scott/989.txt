Tyler, The Creator‘s Chromakopia is poised to make a big splash on next week’s Billboard 200 chart.
Despite it having a shorter tracking window due to it being released on Monday (October 28) instead of the previous Friday, the album is expected to cruise to number one with the biggest first-week sales of his career.

According to HITS Daily Double, Chromakopia is on track to earn least 250,000 equivalent units in its opening week, with it being estimated that the number could go as high as 300,000 before final numbers are tallied.
As it stands, Tyler would top the Billboard 200 by a large margin ahead of Halsey’s new album The Great Impersonator, which is projected to move around 90,000 units.

If Chromakopia debuts at number one, it would be the first time in 2024 that one rap album has replaced another at the top of the chart with Yeat‘s Lifestyle the incumbent chart-topper.
Chromakopia will also become just the sixth Hip Hop album this year to top the Billboard 200 and boast one of the highest first-week sales of any rap album in 2024.

If it comes in at the higher end of its estimate, only the commercial release of Travis Scott‘s decade-old mixtape Days Before Rodeo (361,000) will have had a bigger tally.
As far as Tyler’s catalog goes, Chromakopia will eclipse the first-week sales of all of his previous albums including Call Me If You Get Lost (169,000) and IGOR (165,000), both of which went number one.
