Rolling Loud is celebrating its 10th anniversary by returning its flagship festival to Miami with an impressive lineup for Rolling Loud Miami 2024. Set to take place from December 13-15 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, this year’s festival promises to be the largest celebration of the festival’s decade-long influence in hip-hop.
Rap superstars Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, and Future will headline the festival. Travis Scott, a fixture at Rolling Loud since its inception in Miami in 2015, continues to be captivated by his dynamic performances. Playboi Carti returns for a second consecutive year, representing the vibrant underground rap scene.

In addition to these A-list headliners, Rolling Loud Miami 2024 will feature a diverse range of performers, including Don Toliver, Polo G, Bryson Tiller, and Lil Yachty. The lineup also highlights emerging talents such as Ken Carson and Cash Cobain, and notable veterans like Curren$y and Denzel Curry.
