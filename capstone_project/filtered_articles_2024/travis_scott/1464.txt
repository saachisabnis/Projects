KENTWOOD, La. (WVUE) - A Kentwood man has pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in the slaying of a couple he was working for, according to District Attorney Scott Perrilloux’s office.
Kevin Buckley, 37, was sentenced to life in prison.
Buckley had been living on the couple’s property at the time of the murders and had done so for several years.
In court, members of the Travis family offered emotional victim statements to the court and told the defendant that the couple had loved him and cared for him.
“We rarely see a defendant who is willing to plead guilty as charged when the stakes are this high,” the District Attorney said.
Perrilloux said cases like this one are atypical, especially when the charge is first-degree murder.
Buckley was arrested on Feb. 19 following the death of married couple Lewis Travis, 55, and Iva Travis, 54.
The couple was originally reported missing to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office on Feb. 14.
While gathering information and interviewing family members and friends, detectives made contact with Buckley.
While speaking to Buckley regarding the couple’s whereabouts, he confessed to killing both victims and told detectives the location of their bodies.
