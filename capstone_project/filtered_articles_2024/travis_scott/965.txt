Former President Donald Trump on Friday said that he'd like to announce his vice presidential running mate next week, potentially during the Republican National Convention, and named four key allies as potential picks.
"I’d love to do it during the convention, which would be you know, or just slightly before the convention, like Monday, love to do it on Tuesday or Wednesday, actually, but for a lot of complex reasons that you people understand, pretty much don’t do that," Trump told "The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show."
Trump has been in no rush to reveal his running mate, more than happy to cede the spotlight to the Democratic Party, which is embroiled in the fallout of President Joe Biden's rough debate performance. The former president has a rally scheduled for Saturday evening in western Pennsylvania.
Trump indicated, as NBC News has reported previously, that his VP short list includes GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and JD Vance of Ohio and North Dakota GOP Gov. Doug Burgum. He also named Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., as having been "fierce and great" during a recent television appearance.
"We have a very good bench,” the former president said.
He also shed light on the vetting process, calling it a "highly sophisticated version of 'The Apprentice,'" referring to the popular reality TV show Trump hosted in the 2000s.
Still, Trump described his decision-making process as, "ultimately ... more of an instinct."
The former president also reiterated his belief that Biden will continue to forge ahead with his re-election bid despite calls from some congressional Democrats for him to drop out.
He added that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a weaker opponent to defeat in the general election than Biden, saying, “I think that in many ways, she may be easier than him. And perhaps I’m wrong, but I’ve been pretty good at this stuff over the years."
"I think you’d have a very big problem in the Democrat Party if it was somebody other than her,” Trump added.
Eighteen Democratic lawmakers in the last two weeks have called for Biden to drop out of the presidential race following a poor debate performance against Trump last month.
His appearance on the radio show comes just days before Republicans are set to host their national convention and formally nominate Trump to be the GOP presidential nominee in Milwaukee.
