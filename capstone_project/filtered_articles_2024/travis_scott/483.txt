Desperate Man (Shadow Play), the 2021 Horse of the Year in Canada, became a millionaire in U.S. dollars after taking the first of four $50,000 flights of the opening leg of the MGM Borgata Pacing Series for older harness racing horses and geldings on Monday night (March 18) at MGM Yonkers Raceway. Also taking victories were Rocknroll Runa A, Covered Bridge and Linedrive Hanover.
Driven by Matt Kakaley for trainer Travis Alexander, Desperate Man left from post five and worked his way past Sumomentsomwhere A (driven by Yannick Gingras) for the top spot approaching the :27 second opening quarter. Desperate Man was unchallenged from there, which allowed Kakaley to back down the middle-half fractions to :56 and 1:24.2, and a :27.2 final kicker got Desperate Man to the wire a length and a half ahead of Sumomentsomwhere A in a 1:51.4 mile. Venturesome Arden N (Brent Holland) was the third-place finisher.
DESPERATE MAN REPLAY
﻿
A 6-year-old gelding, Desperate Man is owned by Kathy Cecchin and was bred by Winbak Farm. This was his 17th career victory; he has now banked $1,014,439 and he paid $3.00 to win as the 1-2 favorite. The exacta was $6.60 and the trifecta $32.00.
In the second test Rocknroll Runa A (Rock N Roll Heaven) and driver Mark MacDonald, tracked defending MGM Borgata Pacing Series champion Hellabalou (Gingras) from the pocket through fractions of :27.3, :56.3 and 1:24.1. MacDonald tipped Rocknroll Runa A to the outside coming off the final bend, paced by Hellabalou midway through the stretch and held safe over Whats Stanley Got A (George Brennan), who also swung out after a three-hole journey, by a length and a quarter in 1:52.1. Pleaseletmeknow (Kakaley) also got by a fading Hellabalou for third.
Rocknroll Runa A, owned by trainer Larry Stalbaum, is a 7-year-old gelding. He made his 28th trip to the winner’s circle, sent his earnings to $379,012 and returned $13.20 to win as a 5-1 offering. He led a $178.00 exacta and a $448.00 trifecta.
ROCKNROLL RUNA A REPLAY
Covered Bridge (American Ideal) and driver Jordan Stratton, who was third as the favorite in last year’s championship, got the job done in 1:52.3 in the third section. Starting from post five, Covered Bridge pressed on two-wide to get past 2021 MGM Borgata Pacing Series hero This Is The Plan (Gingras) coming off the opening bend and then controlled a sensible tempo of :27.3, :56.3 and 1:24.3. In the lane Gingras swung This Is The Plan to the outside, and while he did make up some ground, it wasn’t enough as Covered Bridge prevailed by half a length. Naturally Gifted A (Todd McCarthy), who tried a first-over attack out of fourth in the final quarter, was up for third.
Trained by Jeff Gillis for owner Mark Ford, Covered Bridge is an 8-year-old gelding, bred by Winbak Farm. He has a record of 48-19-23 from 142 lifetime efforts, has pocketed $1,228,055 and paid $2.50 to win as the 1-5 choice. He keyed an $11.40 exacta and an $18.40 trifecta.
COVERED BRIDGE REPLAY
Linedrive Hanover (Betting Line), with Scott Zeron in the bike, won the fastest Borgata battle of the night after taking the finale in 1:51.2. Idealsomemagic A (Brennan) set a crisp pace of 26.4, 55.2 and 1:23.1, but Zeron wheeled Linedrive Hanover out of the pocket approaching three-quarters and swept past Idealsomemagic A on the last turn.
Linedrive Hanover would kick away from the rest of the horses from there, taking a 2 3/4 length decision over Coaches Corner (Jason Bartlett), who was left uncovered when Linedrive Hanover cleared to the top. Dunkin’ (Tetrick) tracked Coaches Corner and ended up third.
Linda Toscano sent out Linedrive Hanover, a 6-year-old gelding, for owners West Wins Stable, McKinlay & Fielding and Mac Nichol. Linedrive Hanover is now a 15-time winner from 36 starts and has now stashed away $522,277. The 3-5 favorite, Linedrive Hanover returned $3.50 to win while the exacta and trifecta were worth $16.40 and $180.50, respectively.
