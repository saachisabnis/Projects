In recent years, Mason Disick, the eldest child of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick, has chosen to stay out of the limelight, avoiding appearances on The Kardashians and social media. 
As a result, any new photo of Mason becomes a notable event. Disick's latest picture with his teenage son on a plane has fans praising him as a "great father."
On Tuesday, the 41-year-old dad of three shared a heartwarming snap on Instagram featuring himself and his 14-year-old son Mason as they sat together on an airplane. Disick, wearing black sunglasses and a black T-shirt, leaned into his teenage son, creating a tender father-son moment.
In the background, Mason was seen sleeping against the side of the airplane, his head turned away from the camera. "Young blood knocked on the way home. Best friend 4 life," Disick captioned the photo. 
In addition to Mason, Scott and Kourtney share kids Penelope Disick, 11, and Reign Disick, 9. Kourtney and her husband, Travis Barker, also welcomed their son, Rocky, in November 2023. 
"Things with Kourtney and Scott are cordial," a source told ET of the exes in May. "She is focused on her own life and just wants their kids to feel happy and loved." 
In June, The Kardashians star gave fans a glimpse into his Father's Day celebration on Instagram, showing off how he spent the holiday with his three kids. "Happy Father's Day," Disick found spelled out in large silver balloon letters in his living room on the morning of the holiday. The initials "MPR" were also displayed in balloon letters, representing his children Mason, Penelope, and Reign.
"Thanks my loves 4 making this day what it is to me! ❤️," the dad of three captioned the photo. Earlier that same month, the proud father shared a post celebrating Mason's graduation from middle school.
"Congratulations 2 my best friend in the world 🌎 for graduatiuating [sic] middle school and now on to high school! Let’s go mart!!," Disick wrote, accompanying a photo of him standing between Mason and a friend. The picture, taken outside Nobu Malibu, showed Mason and his friend with their backs to the camera while Disick rested his arms on their shoulders.
"How is he in high school already? I swear he was just born 😢," commented one follower, while another added, "Go Mase!!! It’s crazy how fast they grow up 🥹😭."
