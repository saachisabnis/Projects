With INSANO week officially here, Kid Cudi has followed up on his promise to reveal the tracklist the Monday prior to the project’s release. Featuring the likes of Young Thug, Travis Scott, Pharrell and Lil Yachty, the 21-song INSANO is shaping up to be an otherworldly sonic symposium.
Cudi also enlists DJ Drama on the first cut, as well as Lil Wayne on “Seven” and A$AP Rocky on “Wow.” The cut dubbed “X & Cud” features vocals from XXXTentacion as well.

The album’s lineup includes previously released tracks “PORSCHE TOPLESS” from June 2023, as well as “AT THE PARTY” with Pharrell and Travis Scott. Scott has two features on the album, with the other entitled “GET OFF ME.”
“MOST AIN’T DENNIS,” which Cudi dropped off solely on Soundcloud, nabs a spot on the album, though “ILL WHAT I BLEED,” released on streaming in tandem with “MOST AIN’T DENNIS,” does not.
Based on the rapper’s below on X, there is still more INSANO to come – after all, he did promise a deluxe version. He reaffirmed the sentiment once and for all.

I said there will be a deluxe. Patience 😌✌🏾
