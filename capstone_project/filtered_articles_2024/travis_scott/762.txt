	We have a long time before we’ll find out if Rocky Thirteen Barker actually takes after his dad, but for now, we know that at least they’re bonding in the most fitting way. Mom Kourtney Kardashian just shared a cute and chic roundup of photos on Instagram, and there are two ultra-sweet photos of Rocky “drumming” with dad Travis Barker.

	










	There’s one of Rocky sitting in the Blink-182 drummer’s lap at a drum set. The picture is taken from behind and we can see that the 8-month-old has a full head of dark black hair. But the photo that really is just too. damn. precious. is the closeup of Barker holding Rocky. The infant is wearing a black bodysuit and his back is against his dad’s chest. And in each tiny little hand, he clutches a drumstick.

	In another shot, it looks like Rocky is about to drop one of those sticks in Kardashian’s neatly manicured hand.

	“It’s the photo with Dad’s sticks that has me melted😍,” one follower said.

	And we can’t think of a more perfect way for Rocky to get close to his dad than drumming. Well … maybe getting tattoos together like Barker did with his daughter Alabama, but that’s a ways away.



	Barker and Kardashian each have three other children from previous relationships, and Kardashian’s 9-year-old son Reign was also in some of Kardashian’s moody photos. Fans could not get over how grown up and stylish he looked.

	“Omg …. Reign is SO BIG!!!!!!”

	“Reign is such an icon 🖤”

	In multiple photos, Reign — who Kardashian shares with ex Scott Disick — is beside his mom as she pushes Rocky in the cult-favorite stroller she owns. In one shot, he looks adoringly down into the stroller, and we bet he’s such a fun and attentive big brother!

	That said, he might not want another little sibling anytime soon. Or, at least he doesn’t want to see any PDA that could lead to said sibling’s arrival. On a recent episode of The Kardashians, he called out his mom and stepdad for kissing in front of him.

	“Stop making out with Travis, bro!” the pre-teen pleaded. “Like, didn’t you just have a baby?! Don’t get another one this quick!”

	He was even more horrified when Barker then gave the Lemme founder a quick kiss on the neck. “Are you giving her a hickey now?”



	But Kardashian is not going to tone down the PDA. In a confessional, she said she thinks it’s good for her kids to see. “I think it is a beautiful thing to see parents — especially ones that just had a new baby — be affectionate and loving,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong with that.”
