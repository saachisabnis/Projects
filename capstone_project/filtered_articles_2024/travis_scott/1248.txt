Fans grow to know and love reality TV stars as real people, not as characters — which makes the loss hit even harder.
In recent years, stars from The Deadliest Catch, The Real World, Survivor, The Real Housewives, Buckwild, and The Bachelorette have died suddenly and tragically.
In some cases, the production of the show is massively impacted. In April 2013, MTV hit pause on the production of Buckwild, a reality series that followed nine young adults in West Virginia, after the death of star Shain Gandee.
The reality star, along with his uncle and friend, were found dead after an off-roading accident. Gandee was 21 years old. According to the West Virginia Sheriff’s Department, the group died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vehicle got stuck in the mud.

His mom, Mary Hobbs, confirmed his death to The Sun. She revealed she “was with him” when the ATV accident occurred, saying that it crushed his skull and led to his death.

“They got a pulse and they did revive her. She was not DOA when it occurred,” the publicist added. “She was there basically 24 hours before she transitioned.

The Bachelorette season 15 contestant was rushed to the hospital in Boca Raton, Florida, on January 13, 2020, after an apparent overdose. Following a week in the hospital, Gwozdz died at the age of 29.
Gwozdz made headlines in May 2019 after he mysteriously left the ABC dating series during the third episode. “Tyler G. had to leave, and that’s upsetting because I really enjoyed my date with him,” lead Hannah Brown said during the episode.
While a Reddit user accused Gwozdz of being an “extreme misogynist” who spit on an ex-girlfriend, he denied the claims in a statement to Refinery29.
“Addressing totally unsubstantiated rumors posted to Reddit from an anonymous account seems imprudent,” he said May 2019. “I feel that even addressing them gives them some sort attention and fuel but I continue to have faith in my journey and in a purpose for everything that’s happened to me in my life. Above everything else I am a son to my mother. She raised me to be better than these sort of baseless accusations. The rumors are so far out of the realm of my personality and values that it seems silly to waste time denying, but I suppose I will for the record.”
