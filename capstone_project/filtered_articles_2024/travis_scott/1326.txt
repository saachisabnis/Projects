That's why the "Jennifer's Body "star didn't hesitate to respond to criticism over her appearance at the Kansas City Chiefs' 2024 Super Bowl after-party Feb. 11, where she posed for photos with fiancé Machine Gun Kelly, tight end Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift.

"turns out it was just a shadowy cell phone pic of me looking like a ukrainian blowup doll. when in REALITY i look like one of those super expensive silicone real sex dolls you can only get in japan."

It's clear Fox couldn't care less as she had a ball under the neon lights of Zouk Nightclub at Resorts World Las Vegas surrounded by her friends.

The hilarious TikTok showed Kelce sticking out his tongue at the camera before the "Karma" singer panned over to her parents, who were quietly sipping their drinks amid the crowded club. And Swift couldn't help but rethink her family outing.
But the Grammy winner laughed it off, captioning the video, "accidentally going clubbing with your parents is something everyone should try at least once in their life."
