 Kylie Jenner is supporting her daughter's latest artwork!

 The â€ŽKylie Cosmetics founder, 26, uploaded an image of two adorable portraits drawn by her and ex Travis Scott's daughter Stormi Webster, 6, on her Instagram Story Friday.

 The portraits included a drawing of Jenner and a self-portrait done by Stormi â€” both of which featured circular heads, smiley faces and large eyes.

 "Stormi's portraits," Jenner captioned her social media post alongside a few tilted laughing emojis.

 Back in November, Stormi's brother Aire Webster showed off his own artistic skills.

 At the time, the now-2-year-old could be seen on Jenner's Instagram Story putting together a painting of his own while hanging out with their family puppy, Moo Pants.

 In the photo, Aire drew on white paper with various colored markers, including some yellows, greens and oranges.

 Jenner's sister Kim Kardashian also has an artist in her household, as North West, 10, has continued to surprise fans with her own artistic abilities over the years.

 In 2021, Kardashian, 43, responded to negative feedback and speculation from Instagram followers who questioned whether or not North had actually painted a piece of artwork that her mother uploaded.

 "I'm supposed to go but i can't stop thinking about how north west did not paint this," wrote one X (formerly Twitter) user, whose message was later shared on Kardashian's Instagram Story with the caption, "DON'T PLAY WITH ME WHEN IT COMES TO MY CHILDREN!!!"

 "My daughter and her best friend have been taking a serious oil painting class where their talents and creativity are being encouraged and nurtured," Kardashian wrote.

 "North worked incredibly hard on her painting with took several weeks to complete," she added. "As a proud mom, I wanted to share her work with everyone."

 Since then, North has created a few other notable works shared by her mom, including an oil paining of a sunset that she brought to life in September 2023. The artwork showed a beach with a vibrant sky, featuring pink, purple and orange hues.

 "North's new painting ðŸ©·ðŸ’œðŸ§¡ðŸ’›," the SKIMS founder captioned the photo at the time.
