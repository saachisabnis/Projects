Kourtney Kardashian is getting candid about her postpartum journey. 
The Poosh founder opened up about her feelings toward her body after giving birth to her youngest child, Rocky Barker, whom she shares with husband Travis Barker, on Instagram on Saturday. 
“I was 3 months postpartum and not feeling quite ready for a big shoot like this where there’s lots and lots of people watching me all day,” she wrote alongside behind-the-scenes snaps from Season 5 of “The Kardashians.”
“Even though my baby boy was with me all day on set it’s not the same when I’m covered in makeup, in high heels and wearing a dress versus our snuggly days at home in pajamas.”
However, Kardashian, 45, said she’s been “shifting” her mindset to start thinking of the positive side of things.
“I am so blessed to be able to bring my baby to work. How fun to get to be glammed up when I’ve been home for months in pajamas,” she added. 
“How blessed to get to work alongside my sisters and mom…we really have so much fun together! What a beautiful life!”
Page Six confirmed the reality star and Travis, 48, welcomed their baby boy in November 2023. The couple posted the first pictures of Rocky the following month on Instagram. 
The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum is also mom to three other children, sons Mason, 14, and Reign, 9, and daughter Penelope, 11, whom she shares with her ex Scott Disick. 
The Blink-182 drummer is also dad to son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, whom he welcomed with his ex-wife, Shanna Moakler. 
Travis is also close to his ex-wife’s daughter Atiana, 25, whom she shares with Oscar De La Hoya. 
Season 5 of Hulu’s “The Kardashians” will premiere on May 23.
