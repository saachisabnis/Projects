	On Tuesday (Oct. 15), Travis Scott accepted his I Am Hip Hop Award at the 2024 BET Hip Hop Awards in Las Vegas. The hip-hop polymath received the honor after his decade-plus of wins and achievements in the rap space as a hitmaker and producer. Presented by Brisk, Teyana Taylor and Travis’ Epic Records labelmate Tyla were on hand to present him with the award.

	“I come from this generation where they considered us nowhere near hip-hop,” said Travis during his acceptance speech. “Every day, I try to push the sound. Coming in as a producer, nobody knew what I was trying to do, but I always had this idea and I had this vision still to this day to take this sound and take things to the next level. I’m just so glad that we made it this far.”

	Scott’s hellacious run in hip-hop can be credited to his 100-plus Billboard Hot 100 entries and two blockbuster releases, 2018’s Astroworld and 2023’s Utopia, which both secured the top spot on the Billboard 200. Earlier this year, Scott re-released his 2014 project Days Before Rodeo for streaming platforms and earned another chart-topping win for his stout resume.

	“I come from Houston, Texas and we don’t have a lot of billboards and a lot of big advertisements to try to get us on our way,” added Scott. “I just want to let everybody know where you come from, it doesn’t really matter. It’s just what goes on in your brain can take you to the next level and beyond. With true focus, true drive, and real surroundings, you can go wherever the f–k you want to go.”

	In addition to shouting out his kids, Stormi and Aire, he thanked the network, too. “I just want to thank you, BET, for actually recognizing me. I be feeling like sometimes people don’t give a f–k about me, so this is actually dope.”
