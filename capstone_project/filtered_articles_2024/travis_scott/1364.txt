Travis Scott will make his return to Coachella in 2025. According to a report TMZ published on Wednesday, November 20, the Houston native has been booked as the closing act on Saturday night during the height of the massive music and arts festival in Indio, Calif. It'll be Scott's first time back at Coachella since he performed on the first day of the festival in 2017. Festival organizers have been trying to bring him back ever since. He was originally set to make his debut as a headliner in 2020. Unfortunately, the festival was cancelled twice due to the pandemic. 
Coachella originally rescheduled Scott's headlining performance for 2022. A few months later, the tragedy at his Astroworld Festival happened in Houston. After 10 people lost their lives in a stampede at the festival, a petition to have Scott removed from Coachella's lineup circulated and reached over 70,000 signatures. Coachella's organizers ultimately decided to take him off the lineup and reportedly paid him a kill fee. Travis Scott has dropped a lot of new music since his last Coachella performance between his recent UTOPIA album and other popular collaborations. Fans can expect to experience two weekends full of action-packed performances from La Flame. He spent the past year preparing for his headlining by delivering powerful sets during his "Circus Maximus Tour." His international string of shows was one of the highest-grossing tours of 2024 with over $1.5 million in revenue.Scott will reportedly headline Coachella with Post Malone, Green Day and Lady Gaga. The festival is set to go down on April 11-13 and April 20-22.
