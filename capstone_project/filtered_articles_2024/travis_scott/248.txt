The fifth edition of the Velocity Invitational returns this weekend to Sonoma Raceway, where 2009 Formula 1 world champion Jenson Button and an array of NTT IndyCar Series and other marquee drivers will headline the historic racing event.
In 2023, Velocity founder Jeffrey O’Neil and the McLaren Racing Formula 1 team partnered to create an unforgettable experience where the team took over a building with an installation of eight F1 McLaren F1 cars spanning 1969-2008 and drivers like Lando Norris, Tony Kanaan, Pato O’Ward, Alexander Rossi, Stefan Johansson and team CEO Zak Brown rotating through the machines.
In 2024, the involvement is significantly smaller, but McLaren has dispatched Kanaan, local product Nolan Siegel and, in his first official duty for the Arrow McLaren IndyCar team, Christian Lundgaard.
The trio will pilot three privately-owned turbocharged McLaren Indy cars with the 1974 M16C/D “Black Label” formerly driven by David Hobbs, Johnny Rutherford’s Gatorade-liveried 1975 M16E and the Red Roof Inns 1978 M24 being shared among the 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner and the team’s current drivers.
Kanaan achieved a lifelong dream of driving his hero Ayrton Senna’s championship-winning 1991 McLaren MP-4/6 at last year’s event (pictured above) and will prepare himself for the brutish power of an old school Indy car when he arrives on Friday.
“I don’t think anything Velocity will do ever again will top that for me, because of many reasons,” Kanaan told RACER. “So I was grateful that they invited me back, and now I can come and enjoy and be more relaxed. It’s almost like when Dan  won his first 500, he was all happy and stuff, and then he goes, when he won his second, ‘Man, I enjoyed the second a lot more because I was more relaxed.’ Bro, it’s the same thing to me.
“I’m going this weekend with no pressure, no butterflies about driving one of Senna’s cars. I know I’m going to drive old IndyCar. I’m going to see old friends. I’m just going to enjoy the weekend this time.”
Fellow IndyCar driver Romain Grosjean from Juncos Hollinger Racing will also be driving a few cars that have yet to be determined, and rally and drifting stars Travis Pastrana, Scott Speed and Ryan Tuerck complete the array of stars who will be in motion.
“I don’t know what I’m gonna drive yet,” Grosjean said. “I know there are really cool cars up there, so I’m not worried about getting a cool ride.
“I think it’s fantastic that a new U.S. organizer is starting an event like this that are high-end, well organized, at beautiful places. I’m excited to go; I’ve heard really good feedback from different people. It’s not a secret that I love wine and I love cars. It sounds like it’s a great fit.”
