Lana Del Rey knows Taylor Swift is far more than just a pretty face and electric soul.
The "Young and Beautiful" singer reflected on the secret to the Grammy winner's skyrocketing popularity in recent years, which has led to sold-out shows worldwide and historic musical achievements.
"She wants it," Lana told BBC in an interview published June 6. "She's told me so many times that she wants it more than anyone. And how amazing—she's getting exactly what she wants. She's driven, and I think it's really paid off."
It's an honor for Taylor to receive that praise from the 38-year-old—who was featured on the "Cruel Summer" artist's song "Snow on the Beach"—since she's previously described herself as a "massive fan of Lana Del Rey."
"The fact that I get to exist at the same time as her is an honor and a privilege and the fact that she would be so generous as to collaborate with us on this song is something I'm gonna be grateful for life," Taylor said in an Oct. 28 Instagram video. "Absolutely love her."
And this wasn't the only time the 34-year-old sang Lana's praises. She gushed over her latest album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, during her Las Vegas show last March.
"Guys, it's so good," Taylor said in a clip from the concert. "You probably already know that. But it's just extraordinary. I just think she's the best that we have. And so, I think we need to make it a priority as a group to stream, buy, support this album and this artist."
She also cited the "Summertime Sadness" singer as a source of inspiration.
"Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music," Taylor said in her acceptance speech at the 2019 Billboard's Woman of the Decade Award. "That example should inspire all of us, that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us."
Lana isn't the only celeb who's shared support for Taylor. Keep reading to see all the stars who've attended the Eras Tour.
