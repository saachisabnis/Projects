This summer promises to be jam-packed for the Premier League’s best and brightest.
Euro 2024, the Copa America and also the men’s football tournament at the Olympic Games in Paris are all on the agenda. All the while, the 20 teams from England’s top flight will be preparing for the start of the 2024-25 season on the weekend of August 17-18.

There will be friendlies both at home and in prestigious stadiums across the globe, with Premier League teams playing each other in the United States.
Here’s what every Premier League club has planned for pre-season…
Arsenal return to the U.S. this summer for their pre-season tour. The club have scheduled three friendlies. On July 24, they play Bournemouth at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles, on July 27 they face Manchester United at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, and then on July 31, they play Liverpool at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field.
As a consequence of Euro 2024, Arsenal will forego their annual trip to the Adidas HQ in Germany. Manchester United’s victory in the FA Cup final means Arsenal will be absent from the Community Shield this year. Instead, friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Lyon confirmed for August 7 and August 11 respectively.
When are they back for pre-season training?
Arsenal’s first-team players will report back for pre-season on July 15. A group of players have been in Marbella for a ‘pre-pre-season’ mini-camp with a focus on getting fit ahead of the new season.
Those who went to the mini-camp will have a week off before reconvening for the proper start of Arsenal’s pre-season. Their under-21s are already back for their pre-season preparations.
Who might be missing when they return?
Arsenal have had 13 players involved at the 2024 European Championship and Copa America. Players are given roughly three weeks off after competing in international tournaments, so returns will likely be staggered depending on how well they do with their nations.
Of the 11 involved at the Euros, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Jakub Kiwior and Kieran Tierney were eliminated at the group stage. The full extent of Tierney’s hamstring injury that he sustained during Scotland’s 1-1 draw with Switzerland is not yet known but three weeks should give Zinchenko and Kiwior time to join Arsenal’s US Tour at the end of July.

Jorginho and Leandro Trossard were both eliminated in the round of 16 and both also have a chance of being on the US tour.
Those involved in the quarter-finals onwards (Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Aaron Ramsdale, William Saliba, Kai Havertz and David Raya) will be monitored individually, as will Gabriel Magalhaes and Gabriel Martinelli, who are part of the Brazil squad that play Uruguay in the Copa America quarter-finals on Saturday, July 6.

Villa will begin pre-season preparations at the start of July when the squad convene and return to the familiar coaching drillings of Unai Emery.
As is customary between the two clubs, Villa’s pre-season schedule begins on July 17 against Walsall and they will return to the Bescot Stadium in August to play Athletic Bilbao once they arrive back in England after a three-match tour of the U.S.
Before that tour, Emery’s side will also have a short stopover in Slovakia to face FC Spartak Trnava. After it, they face Borussia Dortmund in Germany.
As with last summer, Villa base themselves in Washington for the first part of the American trip, which will see them play three games across three different cities in six days.
The first fixture is against Colombus Crew on July 27, with Villa travelling to Ohio, before then playing RB Leipzig in New Jersey four days later. Villa conclude their U.S. tour by going to Chicago and taking on Mexican champions Club America.
When are they back for pre-season training?
Players will filter back to Bodymoor Heath in the coming weeks, with a significant chunk of the first-team squad and under-21s returning on July 8.
Who will be missing during the early stages of pre-season training?
Aston Villa have seven players who have or are currently featuring for their countries at either Euro 2024 or Copa America. This includes key players such as Emiliano Martinez — who is with Argentina at Copa America and also wished to participate in the upcoming Paris Olympics next month, but was left out by head coach Javier Mascherano — Ollie Watkins and John McGinn. New signing Ian Maatsen will also return later, given his involvement with the Netherlands at Euro 2024.

It helps to have friends in high places — particularly your own chairman.
Bournemouth are heading stateside for their pre-season tour this summer. And thanks to their American owner Bill Foley, they’ll be put up at the five-star Hotel Californian in Santa Barbara, which he bought in 2021.
The ‘Bourne in the USA’ tour (stop cringing) will comprise two matches, the first of which has been announced against Hollywood’s favourite EFL team, Wrexham, on Saturday, July 20, at Harder Stadium. Bournemouth’s second is against Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 24.
USMNT captain Tyler Adams is bound to be popular among American fans as Bournemouth make use of the training facilities of MLS team LA Galaxy.
When they return to the UK, Bournemouth will face Rayo Vallecano (August 4) and Girona (August 10) at the Vitality Stadium.
When are they back for pre-season training?
Bournemouth’s senior players are expected to report back for pre-season training in the coming days.
Who will be missing during the early stages of pre-season training?
Players that featured in tournaments this summer will likely return to Bournemouth later than others, with Ryan Christie (Scotland), Milos Kerkez (Hungary) and Illiya Zabarnyi (Ukraine) all involved at Euro 2024. 
The same goes for USMNT midfielder Tyler Adams, whose side exited the competition in the group stages, and Luis Sinisterra, who is still involved with Colombia.

Thomas Frank’s side participated in the Premier League’s Summer Series last year and everybody involved described it as a positive experience that they would be keen to repeat in the future.
However, the event is not taking place in 2024, which means Brentford have opted for a pre-season training camp in Lisbon in July, during which they will face Portuguese giants Benfica and Estrela da Amadora.

When are they back for pre-season training?
Brentford’s first-team squad returned to training last on June 26. They will spend the next couple of weeks being put through their paces by head coach Thomas Frank before receiving a few extra days of holiday ahead of their pre-season tour to Lisbon.
It is only a small group of players who have reported back to Jersey Road including Keane Lewis-Potter, Rico Henry and Aaron Hickey. Henry and Hickey missed the majority of last season through injury and they will be keen to reach full fitness in time for Crystal Palace’s visit on the opening weekend.
Who will be missing during the early stages of pre-season training?
Denmark’s defeat to Germany means there are only two remaining Brentford players at the Euros. Ivan Toney will be hoping to feature in England’s quarter-final against Switzerland after coming off the bench to help them beat Slovakia but Mark Flekken is yet to feature for the Netherlands. 
Ethan Pinnock can enjoy some time off after Jamaica finished bottom of their group and failed to earn a point at the Copa America. Club-record signing Igor Thiago officially joined on July 1 but will spend the next week settling into life in London.
The 23-year-old has recovered from the knee injury he suffered in April which forced him to miss Club Bruges’ final games of the season and will travel to Lisbon with his new team-mates.

Enzo Marseca started with his players for the first time when those not involved in internationals over the summer reported back on July 4.
As things stand, no other friendlies have been arranged other than those on the club’s pre-season tour to the U.S. Chelsea had been in talks with League Two side AFC Wimbledon over playing a match before setting off across the Atlantic, although nothing has been confirmed as yet.
Chelsea are going to play five games in the space of 14 days in America, covering over 13,000 miles on the trip.
Maresca’s side have games against Wrexham, Celtic and Club America to build some momentum before the much tougher tests of Manchester City and Real Madrid. They also face Italian champions Inter on August 11, which will be Maresca’s first game in charge at Stamford Bridge.

Unlike previous seasons, Fulham are leaving it late to announce their plans for the first half of the summer. Twelve months ago, they travelled to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series and the season before that, they played in the Algarve Football Cup on Portugal’s south coast.
They are expected to travel to Portugal for a pre-season camp.
When are they back for pre-season training?
The majority of Fulham’s squad will be returning in stages to Motspur Park for pre-season testing and then training in the next two weeks. It will be a staggered return, with some players still on international duty and therefore will require some further time off.
Who will be missing during the early stages of pre-season training?
Those who are still involved in competition either at the Copa America or the European Championships will be the last to return. They include Andreas Pereira, with Brazil, Luc de Fougerolles, with Canada, and Joao Palhinha with Portugal — the latter is expected to leave the club after Fulham agreed a fee for him with Bayern Munich.
Timothy Castagne (Belgium), Bobby De Cordova-Reid (Jamaica) Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson (USMNT) have been eliminated from their tournaments but will likely be given a break before returning. Ream is also in talks with Charlotte FC regarding a transfer while De Cordova-Reid is technically out of contract, although he has an offer on the table from Fulham.
Sasa Lukic was on duty with Serbia, who were eliminated in the group stages at Euro 2024.

It’s all change at Ipswich this summer as the club prepares for a first season in the Premier League in 22 years, but they will welcome a familiar opponent to Portman Road in pre-season.
Ipswich host Fortuna Dusseldorf on July 27, having formed a long-standing friendship with the second-tier German side over the past 18 years. What began as an innocuous trip to Ipswich in 2006 by the former Fortuna stadium announcer Ulli Munsterberg has blossomed into an annual Portman Road pilgrimage for a large group of Fortuna fans, with Ipswich supporters frequently making the return trip to Germany too.

Just as they did last summer, Kieran McKenna’s side will also head to Austria in pre-season. There they will play two one-hour friendlies against Shakhtar Donetsk on the same day: July 20.
When are they back for pre-season training?
Ipswich returned to pre-season training on Monday, July 1.
Who might be missing when they return?
Vaclav Hladky is the big miss. The 33-year-old became Ipswich’s first-choice goalkeeper last season following an injury to regular No 1 Christian Walton. He seized his opportunity in the first team and was crucial to Ipswich’s promotion to the Premier League, earning particular praise for his ability with the ball at his feet.
However, Hladky and the club failed to agree new terms and his departure as a free agent was confirmed at the start of the month. Kayden Jackson and Dominic Ball have also exited after the conclusion of their contracts, Sone Aluko has retired, and Kieffer Moore, Jeremy Sarmiento and Lewis Travis have returned to their parent clubs.

The departure of Enzo Maresca to Chelsea has put plans for pre-season on hold until a new manager is brought in at Leicester City.
The aim this summer was to take advantage of a longer break until the Premier League kicks off on August 17, allowing more time to work on Maresca’s tactical approach.
After an initial week of testing and fitness work at their Seagrave training camp in north Leicestershire, the players will head to a European training camp and then play a selection of friendlies, some abroad and some against lower-league sides away from home. Traditionally, they finish with a home friendly.
When are they back for pre-season training?
The majority of the Leicester players will meet new manager Steve Cooper for the first time on July 8, when they return for pre-season training at their Seagrave training base.

Newcastle United’s pre-season schedule is looking pretty light at the moment — but that is because they have only confirmed their tour of Japan so far. That will take place at the end of July, with matches against the Urawa Red Diamonds and Yokohama F Marinos in and around Tokyo.
Before that, however, Newcastle are expected to head to Herzogenaurach in Germany, to Adidas’s state-of-the-art headquarters, for a training camp.
There will also likely be some domestic friendlies in July, as well as the Sela Cup at St James’ Park on August 9 and 10, while Eddie Howe, the head coach, is also looking to arrange some behind-closed-doors matches.

That is something Howe tends to do anyway during pre-season, but the need to get game time into Sandro Tonali’s legs, given the Italian’s 10-month ban for betting offences ends on August 29 and he cannot play in front of crowds, is also a factor.
And, of course, let’s not forget that Newcastle played a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur in Australia last month.
When are they back for pre-season training?
The squad is due to filter back in different groups for testing from around July 12.
Who will be missing during the early stages of pre-season training?
With Kieran Trippier, Anthony Gordon and Fabian Schar still at the Euros — and set to face off when England take on Switzerland a Euro 2024 quarter-final on Saturday — they are unlikely to be back for the first day. Martin Dubravka might not be either, despite Slovakia’s last-16 exit.
The same is true for Miguel Almiron, who was eliminated from the Copa America with Paraguay, but Bruno Guimaraes is still representing Brazil in the tournament.
Sven Botman and Jamaal Lascelles’ respective ACL injuries will also rule them out, but the rest of the squad should be fit.

They round off their time in South Korea with a friendly against Bayern Munich, which will reunite them with Harry Kane and Eric Dier. The fixture will also pit Son Heung-min and Kim Min-jae, two of the biggest Korean stars, directly against each other.
Spurs conclude their preparations for the 2024-25 season with another clash against Bayern, but this time it will be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, allowing their UK-based fans to show their appreciation for Kane and Dier’s contributions over the last decade.
