New Delhi [India], December 12 (ANI): Ahead of the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Brisbane, former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar said that now Australia has the momentum in the series.
The third Test match of the BGT series will be played in Brisbane's iconic The Gabba from Saturday. Earlier in the Adelaide Test, India conceded a disappointing 10-wicket defeat to Australia.
Speaking exclusively to Star Sports, Sunil Gavaskar said that following the win in Perth Test the momentum was with India but the 10-day gap affected the tourists.
"The momentum that the Indian team got in Perth was lost during the 10-day gap. Now the momentum is with Australia because they have won this Test match. After the Adelaide Test, a few days later, you are playing at The Gabba. So, the momentum is now with the Australian team," Sunil Gavaskar was quoted in a release from Star Sports as saying.
Recapping the Adelaide Test, India won the toss and opted to bat first. However, they had to face the wrath of a moving, erratic pink ball and its mastermind, Mitchell Starc (6/48). Except for a 69-run stand for the second wicket between KL Rahul (37 in 64 balls with six fours) and Shubman Gill (31 in 51 balls, with five fours) and a fighting 42 in 54 balls (three fours and three sixes) from Nitish Kumar Reddy, there was not much highlights from India who were skittled out for 180 runs. Skipper Cummins and Scott Boland also took two wickets.
In the first innings, a 67-run partnership between Nathan McSweeney (39 in 109 balls, with six fours) and Marnus Labuschagne (64 in 126 balls, with nine fours) for second wicket set the platform for Travis Head to impose his domination over Indian bowlers yet again with a counter-attacking 140 in 141 balls, with 17 fours and four sixes, just when Aussies lost some regular wickets. His century took Australia to 337 runs and gave them a 157-run lead.
Jasprit Bumrah (4/61) and Mohammed Siraj (4/98) were top bowlers for India. Ravichandran and Nitish got a wicket each.
In their second innings, India appeared even more toothless as the star-studded top-order and middle-order returned back to pavillion despite starts from Jaiswal (24 in 31 balls, with four boundaries), Gill (28 in 30 balls, with three fours) while KL Rahul (7) and Virat Kohli (11 in 21 balls with a four) failed to score well. India ended day two at 128/5.
On the third day, Pant also lost his wicket for 28 in 31 balls, with five fours. From there on, it was not looking back for the Aussies, who skittled out India for 175 runs in 36.5 overs. India led by just 18 runs, setting Aussies 19 runs to win.
Skipper Cummins (5/67) took a majestic five-wicket haul, his eighth as a captain. Boland took 3/51 while Starc took 2/60.
Set a target of 19 runs, Khawaja (10) and McSweeney (9) chased it down without breaking a sweat in 3.2 overs. (ANI)
