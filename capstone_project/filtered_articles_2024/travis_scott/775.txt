Hallmark Media Chief Communications Officer Annie Howell speaks during Hallmark Channel’s "Christmas ... More on Cherry Lane" New York Screening on December 07, 2023 in New York City.
Call them cheesy, sappy or too “touchy-feely.” Still, there is something inherently wholesome about Hallmark movies that makes them the ultimate winter staple.
Whether they are playing in the background as you cook with family or adding a cozy charm to your living room as you curl up on the couch, Hallmark movies have a way of capturing the spirit of the holidays. Love them or not, these movies’ timeless appeal shows they’re here to stay.
For over 60 years, the Hallmark Channel has created and distributed movies that tap into a unique niche: family-friendly, uplifting and heartwarming storytelling. While most people associate Hallmark movies with romance or Christmas, the network’s repertoire spans a variety of genres, including romantic comedies, family-friendly fantasies and lighthearted adventures. Whether you’re drawn to seasonal or holiday plots or prefer stories that are centered around Valentine’s romance, there’s likely a Hallmark movie tailored to what you like. In this list, I’ve ranked these films based on their popularity, storyline and replay value. So, if you enjoy charming small-town settings, heartfelt romance and don’t mind indulging in a bit of warm-and-fuzzy sentiment, this might be your sign to take a break from the grittier dramas.
In this holiday romance, travel writer Emory Blake (Bridget Regan) is eager for a break from her chaotic life after a sudden breakup two weeks before Christmas. Determined not to let the split ruin her plans, she decides to go on the couple’s getaway alone. Upon arriving, she discovers her reservation has been double-booked, forcing her to share the cozy space with widowed dad Scott Hays (Travis Van Winkle), his mother and his young daughter. What begins as an awkward situation soon blossoms into a heartfelt story of unexpected love, healing and rediscovering the magic of the holiday season.
