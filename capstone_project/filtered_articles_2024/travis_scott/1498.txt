Travis Konecny scored twice while Tyson Foerster netted a dramatic game-winner with 89 seconds remaining and added an assist as the Philadelphia Flyers earned a 3-2 win over the visiting Boston Bruins on Saturday afternoon.
Less than a minute after Boston goaltender Linus Ullmark denied Scott Laughton with his second breakaway save of the game, Foerster strode into a snap shot from the left circle to win the game at 18:31 of the third period. Ullmark finished with 26 saves.
Konecny became the first Flyer to record consecutive 30-goal seasons since Sean Couturier also reached the milestones in 2017-18 and 2018-19.
Samuel Ersson made 18 saves as Philadelphia (36-26-9, 81 points) improved to 2-2-1 in its last five games and rebounded from a loss in Boston last week.
Justin Brazeau and Danton Heinen scored third-period goals for Boston (41-16-15, 97 points), which has lost twice since a three-game win streak.
Philadelphia had a 29-20 shot advantage -- recording 16 in the third period -- and went 1-for-3 on the power play.
Konecny broke the scoreless deadlock with just 1:45 left in the second period. After Scott Laughton fed the puck to Foerster in the middle for a flubbed one-timer, Konecny banked it off a sprawling Ullmark and over the goal line.
Ullmark's breakaway save allowed Boston to come back and tie the game at 10:19 of the third as Brazeau took a give-and-go pass from Charlie Coyle, cut to the net and moved across from right to left to stick home a backhand finish.
Konecny gave Philadelphia the lead back after taking a quick pass from Morgan Frost in transition and beating Ullmark with 4:44 left in regulation, but the 2-1 advantage lasted just 56 seconds as Morgan Geekie spun for a pass through traffic that Heinen collected and finished with a one-timer from across in the left circle.
Despite each team drawing two power plays, the first period featured just 11 combined shots. Boston had six of them.
Philadelphia's first man advantage started at 14:00 as Brad Marchand was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, showing his frustration after a knee-on-knee hit from Erik Johnson went unpenalized.
The play tilted Boston's way for most of the middle frame, but Ullmark was challenged for key late stops on Ronnie Attard and Owen Tippett before the final timeout and the eventual go-ahead goal.
