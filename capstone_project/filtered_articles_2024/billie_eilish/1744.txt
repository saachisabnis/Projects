Concert season is in full swing around Colorado and many of the hottest artists in the world seem to be coming to Colorado, including Billie Eilish, who just announced two upcoming tour stops in our state.
Spring is here and the Colorado concerts are happening on the daily at this point. As you save your pennies to see some of your favorite artists, Billie Eilish is going to need to be added to your to-do list in 2024.
Making her mainstream debut in 2015 and has been one of the top artists in multiple formats since.  From the Blue Bird to Red Rocks to Ball Arena, Billie has partaken in the amazing music scene in Colorado multiple times.
The last time she was in Denver at Ball Arena, the show sold out in Minutes, leaving many Billie fanatics on the outside looking in, so this time, she's announced two concerts, back to back this November.
Billie Eilish has officially announced the "Hit Me Hard And Soft" World Tour that will kick off this fall. The highly anticipated World Tour will kick off in September in Quebec and will make back 2 back stops in the Mile High City at the Ball Arena on Tuesday, November 19th, and Wednesday, November 20th.
Tickets for both shows will go on sale this Friday, May 3rd, but the two shows on sale will be one hour apart to attempt to combat the high demand and website traffic when purchasing tickets.
The November 19th Denver show will go on sale at noon and the November 20th show will go on sale at 1 pm, and tickets are certain to go fast so plan accordingly.
