For the first time ever, the top five albums of the year were all by female stars
We already know women run the world, but for the first time ever, they all dominated the Spotify streaming charts too. 
The year 2024 marks the first time that the top five streamed albums globally were all from women, revealed by this year’s Spotify Wrapped stats, and a number of familiar faces filled the highly coveted spots. To no one’s surprise, Taylor Swift was named the top-listened-to artist this year with a whopping 26 billion streams, thanks to her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and her billion-dollar-earning Eras Tour, which has captivated audiences for the last two years. Following Swift came Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft in second place, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short ’n Sweet in third, Karol G’s Mañana Será Bonito in fourth, and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine in fifth. As for the top global artists of the year, following Swift is The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, Drake, and Billie Eilish. 
Another pop force, Beyoncé, also made an impact on the Spotify charts this year. Along with her collaborator Shaboozey, the two trailblazing artists helped bring in 36 million first-time listeners to the country genre with their respective records, Cowboy Carter and Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going. 
The pop girlies dominating the top Spotify albums this year provide an intriguing look at the upcoming Grammy season ahead, where Beyoncé, Swift, Eilish, and Carpenter—along with other peers like Charli XCX and Chappell Roan—are all nominated for some of the night’s buzziest awards. Dare we say, maybe the time has finally come to not overlook women’s contributions to music anymore.
