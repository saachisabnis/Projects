Billie Eilish recently announced her third album 'Hit Me Hard And Soft' is coming out in May 2024, but is she taking her new music on tour? Here's what we know.
Since September 2023, Billie Eilish had been teasing fans about new music and in April she officially announced that her third studio album 'Hit Me Hard And Soft' comes out May 17th 2024.
2024 has been a massive year for Billie already as she made history with her second Oscar win, as well as taking home 'Song Of The Year' at the Grammys. And now the 22-year-old singer songwriter is adding an album release to her list of 2024 accomplishments.
Billie concluded her 'Happier Than Ever' tour in April 2023 and it seems that from the moment she stepped off of the stage fans have been willing her to go on tour again. 
Now that she has new music ready, will a tour follow? Here's what we know.
Yep! Billie Eilish has confirmed that she is taking her new album 'Hit Me Hard And Soft' on tour after teasing it with some tour merch.
On April 29 she posted a pic to her Instagram story of her wearing what looked like tour merch for 'Hit Me Hard And Soft'. Excited fans were zooming into the picture trying to figure out when and where she's touring, but now they don't have to as Billie has officially revealed she's going on tour.
In an Instagram post Billie included all the cities and dates for her tour and revealed that tickets go on sale May 3rd.
According to Billie's tour poster she's going on tour as soon as September 2024! She's set to begin tour in Canada and conclude her tour July 2025 in Dublin.
The 'Lost Cause' singer went on tour for her first two albums 'When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?' and 'Happier Than Ever', so it's no surprise she plans to take this album on tour.
Billie pulled out all the stops for the promotional campaign of 'Hit Me Hard And Soft' so we're buzzing to see what her tour roll out is going to look like.

She teased the new album with billboards across the world that featured big blue text, reading things like "do you know how to bend?" and "she's in the headlights", which we assume are lyrics from her new music.
To make sure the whole world was ready for the album announcement she also pulled an Instagram stunt where she added all of her following to her 'close friends list'. This peaked people's curiosity and boosted her following count, when she first did this she had 111 million followers and on the day she announced her new album she had 120 million.
