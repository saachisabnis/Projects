Taylor Swift set a Grammy record by taking home her fourth Album of the Year award Sunday (February 3rd) night for Midnights.  She also won Best Pop Vocal Album and used her speech to announce that her next album, “The Tortured Poets Department” will drop on April 19th. 
Miley Cyrus also took home multiple awards, including her first-ever Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers.”  The Endless Summer Vacation track also took home the award for Record of the Year. The singer gleefully announced that she just won a Grammy during her performance of “Flowers” and revealed to the audience that she may have forgotten underwear during her second speech. 
The night’s leading nominee, SZA, who had nine nods coming into Sunday, left with three pieces of hardware, including best R&B song for “Snooze.” She ran onto the stage a few seconds late to receive her award because she says she stopped for a shot.  She also stopped mid-speech to say “hi’ to Swift from the stage. 
Boygenius and Killer Mike also took home three awards apiece.  And Billie Eilish and Chris Stapleton each took home two.
The most notable acceptance speech of the night belonged to Jay-Z who was presented with the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.  The rapper brought his 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy to the stage with him and noted how far the industry has come since Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff boycotted the Grammys in 1989 over the rap awards not being televised.  He continued to say that the academy still doesn’t always get it right, by referencing his wife, Beyonce's track record.  
Jay-Z said, “I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone, and never won album of the year. Even by your own metric that does not work. Think about that, most Grammys, never won album of the year, that doesn’t work.”
The performances include several tributes to older artists.  Luke Combs performed “Fast Car” with the song’s writer and original singer, Tracy Chapman.  Fantasia Barrino performed “Proud Mary” – her original American Idol audition song – in a tribute to Tina Turner, and 80-year-old Joni Mitchell made her Grammy performance debut with “Both Sides Now” after recovering from a brain aneurysm.
