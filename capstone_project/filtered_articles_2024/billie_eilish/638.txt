In a recent interview with Amelia Dimoldenberg, Grammy-winning artist Billie Eilish disclosed a peculiar dream from years ago that prompted her to end a relationship. The conversation unfolded during an Oscars Nominees “Pre-Luncheon” Luncheon, where Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell discussed various topics.
Prompted by Dimoldenberg’s question about their song Ocean Eyes possibly being about Cillian Murphy, Eilish humorously suggested it might have been about him, while O’Connell joked about admiring Murphy’s eyes in Dunkirk. However, Eilish interjected, emphasizing her admiration for Christian Bale, particularly for his role as Batman in The Dark Knight.
She then recounted a dream she had a couple of years back, where she found herself in a café bathed in sunlight with Christian Bale, an experience that served as a wake-up call for her to end her relationship at the time. Despite the surreal nature of her revelation, Eilish humorously asserted, “I woke up and I came to my senses. It’s over,” much to the surprise of Dimoldenberg and the amusement of O’Connell.
While Eilish didn’t specify the identity of the boyfriend in question, she was last rumored to be involved with Jesse Rutherford, the lead vocalist of The Neighbourhood, though their relationship reportedly ended the previous year.
Eilish and O’Connell are currently nominated for Best Original Song at the 96th Academy Awards for their track What Was I Made For? from the Barbie soundtrack, with plans to perform at the ceremony on March 10th, 2024.
