Billie Eilish isn’t stopping quite yet. Continuing on the HIT ME HARD AND SOFT release train, Eilish has revealed the “Over Now” extended edit of the album’s seventh cut “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE.”
Produced by FINNEAS, “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE [OVER NOW EXTENDED EDIT]” clocks in at four-and-a-half minutes long – which is a minute less than the original iteration of the track. 
This time around, the cut completely fleshes out the more lively, latter bit of the “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE,” skipping over the first half of the song and diving right into the second half. Infused with a bouncy backing beat, per Eilish, the electronic edition of the standout HIT ME HARD AND SOFT offering is club dancefloor-coded.
“MADE AN EXTENDED EDIT FOR YOU TO DANCE IN THE CLURBBBBBBB TO!!! WEEEEEEEE!!!” Eilish wrote in an Instagram caption this morning.

There’s no visual component yet for the song, as Eilish has only rolled out the “Lunch” music video thus far. She also took to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to properly give the fan-favorite cut its live debut just last night.
Stream “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE [OVER NOW EXTENDED EDIT]” on Spotify and Apple Music now and stay tuned to Hypebeast for more updates on HIT ME HARD AND SOFT’s aftermath.
