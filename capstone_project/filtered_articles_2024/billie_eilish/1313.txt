Billie Eilish fans won’t be performing three-hour shows when she heads on tour later this fall. Following the release of her highly-anticipated third studio album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, the singer appeared on the music streaming app Stationhead for a live Q&A.
Asked about the possibility of performing 3-hour shows, similar to some pop stars as of late, Eilish quickly shut down the notion.
“Nobody wants that,” the singer said. “You guys don’t want that. I don’t want that. I don’t even want that as a fan. My favorite artist in the world, I’m not trying to hear them for three hours.”
Taylor Swift’s ongoing Eras tour and Beyoncé’s Renaissance run both exceeded the two-hour mark, though that’s far from the norm for most artists. Eilish praised both of the artists in an interview with the LA Times, saying that “the fact that they can put on a show that long, and it’s filled with so many incredible moments, is really amazing.”
Later during the livestream, Eilish said that she wouldn’t be playing every track off of HIT ME HARD AND SOFT during her concerts. Since attendees will also expect to hear some of her older fan favorites, performing all of the album’s songs would make the show “like a million years long.”
While most venues are already sold out, the remaining tickets for Billie Eilish’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT tour are available now with its North American kicking off on September 29.
