Rita Ora and husband Takia Waititi packed on the PDA as they hit the red carpet at the MTV European Music Awards in Manchester on Sunday evening.
The singer, 33, stunned in a dramatic look as she prepared to make history as the first person ever to present the star-studded ceremony for a third time.  
Rita looked sensational in the light pink gown which was adorned with hundreds of feathers and featured a corset top as she shared a kiss with her filmmaker husband, 49. 
She boosted her height with huge silk heels and wore her brunette tresses in a wavy style while forgoing a necklace and letting the outfit speak for itself. 
Meanwhile Taika, who wed the songstress in 2022, cut a dapper figure in a tailored black suit which he wore over a crisp white shirt.

Rita previously presented the awards show in London in 2017, as well as Düsseldorf in 2022 where she was co-hosted alongside her famous husband. 
It comes after organisers were forced to cancel last year's event in Paris due to security fears amid the Israel and Hamas war. 
During the show Rita paid a heartfelt tribute to pal and collaborator Liam Payne, breaking down in tears she said: 'I just want to take a moment to remember someone very, very dear to us. 
'We lost him recently and he was a big part of the MTV world and my world and I think a lot of yours at home and everybody in here tonight.
'Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could. 
'He brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on the world.'
Breaking down she added: 'So let's just take a moment to remember our friend Liam...'
Rita previously admitted to being 'devastated' by Liam's passing.
The lovebirds couldn't resist a smooch on the red carpet
