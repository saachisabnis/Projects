Who is hosting the 2024 People’s Choice Awards? Canadian actor Simu Liu (Barbie, Shang-Chi, Kim’s Convenience) is hosting the 2024 People’s Choice Awards on Feb. 18. Liu is also nominated for The Movie Performance of the Year as one of the Kens in Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster hit, Barbie.
“I’m so grateful to have been asked to step up to the hosting plate for the 2024 People’s Choice Awards,’” the Marvel star said in a statement, according to NBC News. “It’s exciting to celebrate this incredible year in pop culture, and to do so with the incredible fans that make what we do possible.”

 









Liu promised that he would not “slander “any stars at the upcoming ceremony. “It’s not about slandering anyone. It’s not about getting the most offensive joke that you can possibly get away with. It’s not about being the guy that’s cutting other people down,” he told USA Today. Liu added that he worked with writers to come up with jokes in preparation for the show. “I have an incredible team of writers that are there to support that vision and to punch up and to suggest, ‘How does this joke sound?’ or ‘What if we instead did this?’” he said.
The MCU star also promised Swifties that he’ll talk about Taylor “in the best way.” He continued, “The People’s Choice Awards is about the fan moments of the year that moved us as a population, as a people, and I don’t think anyone had a year quite as influential, as impactful and as upward as Taylor did.”
In 2021 and 2022, the ceremony was hosted by SNL comedian and actor Kenan Thompson.
Who is nominated for the 2024 People’s Choice Awards? In film, Barbie leads with eight nods, followed by Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer with six. As for television, Only Murders in the Building earned seven nominations, followed by Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, and The Last of Us, with six nominations each.
