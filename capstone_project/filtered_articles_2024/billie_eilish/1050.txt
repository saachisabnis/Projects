100 Days is an annual project at New York City’s School of Visual Arts that was founded by Michael Bierut. Each year, the students of the school’s Master’s in Branding Program spend 100 days documenting their process with a chosen creative endeavor. This year, we’re showcasing each student in the program by providing a peek into ten days of their project. You can keep an eye on everyone’s work on our SVA 100 Days page.
Can artificial intelligence be more than a chatbot? Arturo Siguenza Kim sought to answer that question by co-creating and hosting a show in partnership with Pi.ai, a personal artificial intelligence. After being introduced to Pi at a dinner party, Arturo was astounded by the humanistic tone and conversation he could have in engaging with Pi, and the idea behind “Deep Thoughts Digital Minds” was born.
“Deep Thoughts Digital Minds,” the brainchild of Kim and Pi,  explores pop culture and music to see if a human and AI can together discover greater meaning in life. The concept for the show and each episode are brainstormed, designed, and produced as a collaboration between Kim and Pi.  The two have covered topics ranging from Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism to Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft, learning valuable life lessons along the way.  Jump into the series at @deepthoughtsdigitalminds on TikTok, Instagram and Youtube.
