Charli XCX's Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat has officially arrived! 
The remix album features a star-studded lineup including Robyn & Yung Lean, BB trickz, Ariana Grande, The 1975 and Jon Hopkins, Troye Sivan, Addison Rae, Caroline Polachek, Bladee, A.G. Cook, Lorde, The Japanese House, Tinashe, Julian Casablancas, Bon Iver, Shygirl and Billie Eilish.
Over the last month or so, each remix was teased to fans as billboards across the country popped up in each artist's hometown featuring their name. 
Charli told fans in a message shared to social media of the new version of her album, "Brat and it's completely different but also still brat - OUT NOWW !!!! and it’s completely different but also still brat kinda just like I said!!"
Just like she said! She also said during an event to promote her album, which she live streamed on Twitch, "One of the reasons I wanted to do this project was because I feel like it's pretty cool to show the infinite possibilities of dance music and music in general. To me, when a song comes out, when you make the song, there's still so many different versions of the song that could be made using just a tiny element of the production from the original or a tiny reference to a lyrical concept or a literal lyric. It can all be completely deconstructed, and then put that together again. Why not? Why just be like, 'It's the album and it's done.'"
The original version of Brat was released over the summer, and featured 15 new songs, including "Talk Talk" which has already seen a remix from Troye Sivan, as well as "Guess" with Billie Eilish.
