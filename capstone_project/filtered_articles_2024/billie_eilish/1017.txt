Record Store Day took place earlier this year. Back in April, independent retailers offered nearly 400 exclusive vinyl pressings from artists like David Bowie, Noah Kahan, Paramore, and many more. Next month, Record Store Day Black Friday will offer a new collection of limited-edition vinyl LPs from Billie Eilish, U2, Lightnin’ Hopkins, and more.
The event which celebrates independent record stores will take place on November 30. Some of the titles listed below will be available in participating stores and on their respective websites. However, some will only be available in-store and in limited numbers.
Highlights from this year’s list of Record Store Day Black Friday releases include a version of Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft featuring isolated vocals, U2’s How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb with unreleased tracks, a 7-inch Beatles single, and a 4 LP pressing of the Grateful Dead live at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on 180-grain vinyl.
