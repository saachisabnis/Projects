Charli xcx has sent the internet into a frenzy (again) by announcing the full slate of artists set to feature on the incoming remix version of her latest album. 
Entitled ‘Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat’, the reworked edition lands this Friday (11th October), and will see a different artist (or two) join Charli on each of ‘BRAT”s tracks. 
We’ve already been treated to a fair few of the new cuts - Charli joined forces with Lorde for a reworked version of ‘girl, so confusing’, with Billie Eilish for the pair’s seismic ‘Guess’ remix, and most recently with Troye Sivan for their ‘Talk talk’ team-up - but there’s still some huge collabs to come, with the likes of Ariana Grande, The 1975, Caroline Polachek, and The Strokes’ Julian Casablancas (!) all working it out on the remix. 
Although it only landed a few months ago, ‘BRAT’ well and truly defined Summer 2024; it was shortlisted for this year’s prestigious Mercury Prize, has become synonymous with a particular brand of chaotic, no-filter fun, and made lime green THE colour of the season. 
You can listen to ‘Talk talk’ (featuring Troye Sivan) and check out the full tracklist for ‘Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat’ below.
