Multiple Academy and Grammy Award-winning artist Billie Eilish is set to read a book by a Northern Irish author and illustrator for CBeebies.
As part of CBeebies Bedtime Story, the singer is set to read 'This Moose Belongs to Me' by Oliver Jeffers on CBeebies and BBC iPlayer this Friday.
Billie introduces the story by saying that as well as loving music, she also loves nature. She tells the tale of a little boy called Wilfred who says he owns a very big moose called Marcel. Most of the time Marcel is very obedient.

But one day, while deep in the woods, someone else claims the moose as their own, and Wilfred learns an important lesson.
Billie said: 'We need to look after beautiful, wild creatures like Marcel, but we also need to let them do their own thing.”
Oliver Jeffers is an award-winning artist, writer and illustrator and recently received an honorary doctorate from Ulster University this summer.
CBeebies Bedtime Story is on each weekday at 6.50pm on CBeebies and BBC iPlayer, bringing families together and has been a daily, family favourite since the channel launched in 2002.
It continues to get the nation reading with its star-studded guests, meaningful partnerships and brilliant stories that inspire a passion for the shared experience of reading.
Billie Eilish added: "My favourite thing in the world as a child was a bedtime story and I would be upset if I didn’t get one! I had a lot and I loved them all!"
