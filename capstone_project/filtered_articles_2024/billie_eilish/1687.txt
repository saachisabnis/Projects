On TikTok, creators share their creativity across a variety of formats, from multi-part Playlists to Stitches to LIVE videos. To expand on the ways creators share and connect, were introducing Flip Story - a new feature that allows creators to add a second side to every story that can be unlocked with a flip.

Flip Story opens new opportunities for connection and engagement between creators and their follower communities. Whether its before-and-after photos or exclusive announcements and sneak peeks, Flip Story adds a layer of fun and surprise to storytelling on TikTok.
How it works
To upload a Flip Story, tap the "+" button to access the Create page and toggle to Story, or select the "+" button on your Profile photo. Youll see the option to add a Flip Story, which requires creators to upload two sides to their Story.
Youll have the option to snap content for Flip Stories directly from the Create page or upload images to a Flip Story from your device. Flip Stories support only image uploads.
To view a Flip Story, simply press the [b"Hold to Flip"[/b] button on the first side of a Flip Story to reveal the hidden content, which will play for a few seconds. Creators will be able to see a separate list of viewers for those that unveiled the second side. All content shared in Flip Stories will go through the same moderation process applied to Stories that are uploaded to TikTok.
Billie Eilishs Flip Story reveal
Billie Eilish surprised fans this week with a Flip Story that revealed a before-and-after look at the build up to HIT ME HARD AND SOFT: THE TOUR. Artists like Billie can now use Flip Stories to connect with fans and surprise them with content drops that can only be unlocked on TikTok.
This past May, TikTok again collaborated with Billie Eilish to launch an exclusive in-app experience celebrating the release of the album. As part of the collaboration, Billie was the first artist to use TikToks Fan Spotlight feature, which allows artists to showcase fan videos at the top of their music tab for up to a week.
TikTok is also toasting Billie Eilish by launching a new in-app experience throughout the North American leg of HIT ME HARD AND SOFT: THE TOUR. Each week, fans can complete tasks to unlock rewards, including a special tour-themed profile frame & exclusive content from Billie.
