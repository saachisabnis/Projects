	As Finneas promotes his latest album For Cryin’ Out Loud!, the hit producer popped into the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge to perform a cover of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees.” In a video posted Friday, Finneas sang an emotional rendition to the 1995 hit, as piano keys swelled in the background.

	Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke previously divulged the origins of the track. The song was “the product of a joke that wasn’t really a joke, a very lonely, drunken evening and, well, a breakdown of sorts,” he said, per Far Out Magazine, describing its beginnings as “a very nice melody that I had absolutely no idea what to do with.”

	Yorke remembered the eventual studio recording as “was one of the worst days for me.” He explained, “I shouted at everyone, and then John Leckie sent everybody else away. He sat me down, and I did a guide vocal on ‘Fake Plastic Trees.’” 

	Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said that after “Thom played it in three takes,” the singer “burst into tears”. 

	










	“Fake Plastic Trees” has gone on to be one of the band’s standout offerings among a prolific body of work and has been covered by numerous artists including Hayley Williams, and Phoebe Bridgers and Arlo Parks (which was also performed on BBC Radio 1).

	Earlier this week, Finneas made a surprise appearance during Billie Eilish‘s tour stop in Newark, New Jersey. As Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft tour came to a close Wednesday, Finneas shredded his guitar alongside Eilish for “Happier Than Ever,” as flames plumed behind them, and also joined her for “Birds of a Feather.”

	In some ways, his second solo album For Cryin’ Out Loud! draws parallels to longtime collaborator and little sister Eilish’s latest album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan described how some tracks echoed her “shadowy, finely burnished alt-pop.” 

	Days after his album’s release, Finneas announced a new leg of his North American tour, with support from Bad Suns. His trek will kick off Feb. 13 in Nashville, followed by stops in Atlanta, Raleigh, Boston, Brooklyn, and Denver.

Finneas told Rolling Stone earlier this year that he hopes to “always be of service” to Eilish when it comes to making music together. Finneas also provided an analogy where if he were to become a father he may need to step aside.

	










	“But that’s so far off, and even then I would probably still be like, ‘I’ll be involved in whatever way you want.’ Totally up to her.” Finneas said. “Hopefully, she’ll just want to keep making albums with me.”
