The 2024 ceremony is the second time SZA has been nominated for record, album, and song in the same year.

The Recording Academy says Grammy award winners and current nominees Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, and Dua Lipa will perform on Feb. 4. More performers have yet to be announced.
All three have previously won in the best new artist category. Eilish has seven Grammys and is up for six this year. Lipa and Rodrigo both have three Grammys; Lipa is nominated for two awards and Rodrigo is nominated for six.
E! will host its “Live from the Grammys Carpet” show with its mix of fashion coverage and celebrity interviews.
The Associated Press will also stream a three-hour red carpet show with interviews and fashion footage. It will be streamed on YouTube, Twitter and APNews.com.
In June, the Recording Academy announced that the Grammys would add three new categories to its 2024 award show: best pop dance recording, best African music performance, and best alternative jazz album.
The new best African music performance category will highlight “regional melodic, harmonic and rhythmic musical traditions,” according to a Recording Academy press release, including genres like Afrobeat, Afro-fusion, Afro Pop, Afro-House, South African Hip-Hop, and Ethio Jazz. Before the addition, those artists would compete in the best global music performance category, first introduced in 2022.
Another notable change: the Academy announced “only human creators” could win the music industry’s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music.
“Here’s the super easy, headline statement: AI, or music that contains AI-created elements is absolutely eligible for entry and for consideration for Grammy nomination. Period,” Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. told AP at the time. “What’s not going to happen is we are not going to give a Grammy or Grammy nomination to the AI portion.”
