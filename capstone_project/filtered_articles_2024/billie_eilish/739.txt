After much anticipation, Billie Eilish’s third studio album has finally been released. The singer celebrated this past week by throwing album listening parties in both Los Angeles and New York City, in which she danced around the venue floors while letting the whole album play without pauses or interruptions. Those who were unable to attend these exclusive gatherings can still catch Eilish on tour later this year. 
While the entire Hit Me Hard and Soft album—which consists of just 10 songs, including the TikTok-viral “Lunch” hit—is available to stream on most platforms, diehard fans can purchase limited edition items at select retailers, like a Target exclusive CD with poster, Target exclusive yellow vinyl, a Walmart exclusive grey vinyl and an Amazon exclusive red vinyl
.

In a recent interview with Billboard, Eilish shared her thoughts on staying environmentally conscious and pursuing sustainable efforts in the music industry. “We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it’s very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging … which ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money,” Eilish said. “I can’t even express to you how wasteful it is.”
For this reason, the exclusive vinyl editions will feature recyclable or recycled compounds and packaging that is made from recycled paper/boards. The ink on these vinyl’s is raw plant-based and water-based dispersion varish, while the sleeves are entirely recycled and re-usable. In addition, CD packaging is made from “softpaks, 100 percent renerable fibers and up to 30% post-consumer recycled fibers that are 100% recyclable,” her website reads. 
All the exclusive Hit Me Hard and Soft merchandise has begun to sell out on Billie Eilish’s website, so look to the above retailers to score your own before it’s all gone.
