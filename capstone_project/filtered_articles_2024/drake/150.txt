Cody Maynard with his food truck Pin Up Coffee will be one of the many local food truck owners participating in next week's "Street Eats on the Green" event.
Green River is set to sizzle with excitement as the community comes together for "Street Eats on the Green," a new food truck event hosted by Green River Parks and Recreation. Set to take place at Expedition Island on July 18 from 5 to 8 p.m., this event promises to be a flavorful evening filled with fun activities and a lively atmosphere. 
"We wanted to create a simple yet enjoyable event for the community," explained Raime Drake, a program supervisor at Green River Parks and Recreation. "A local citizen came up with the idea, and after some brainstorming, we decided to launch 'Street Eats on the Green.' This is our first venture into such an event, and we're excited to see how it unfolds."
The food truck event will host six diverse food trucks, offering a range of meals, snacks, and even coffee. Attendees can look forward to a relaxed evening with friends and family, enjoying delicious food and engaging in various activities. 
"We'll have cornhole boards and a Gaga ball pit set up for some casual, family-friendly fun," Drake noted. "We'll also have non-live music playing through speakers to create a pleasant ambiance."
In addition to the July 18 event, two more food truck nights are scheduled for August 22 and September 12. Each event aims to provide a welcoming space for community members to gather, enjoy great food, and participate in fun games.
To stay informed about upcoming events, community members can follow the Green River Parks and Recreation Facebook page, which regularly posts updates and information. 
"We also share details through the Green River Chamber's newsletter, local radio ads, and news postings," Drake added. "Our Facebook page is a great resource for anyone looking to keep up with what's happening in our community."
Organizing such an event has been a rewarding experience for the team at Green River Parks and Recreation. 
"It's my first time managing events like this, and it's been wonderful to collaborate with supportive colleagues and community members," Drake shared. "It's all about providing a space for people to enjoy each other's company and support local food trucks."
The event is free to attend, with no entry fee required. 
"People can just show up, enjoy the food, and have a good time," Drake emphasized. "Our goal is to support local food trucks and give the community a nice space to hang out in the evening."
Green River Parks and Recreation invites everyone to come out and experience "Street Eats on the Green." It's a fantastic opportunity to enjoy good food, play some games, and connect with neighbors in a friendly, community-focused environment.
