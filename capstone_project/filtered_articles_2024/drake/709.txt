On a new episode of  Funny Marco’s popular web series “Open Thoughts,” the comedian and host welcomed renowned culture vulture and podcasting personality Bobbi Althoff. To the shock of many—including Marco himself—Althoff  dumped a bag full of cash on his lap. Marco immediately asked if it was a setup or if the cash was stolen. 
Althoff dryly replied, “No.”
There was an awkward pause before Althoff commented “you’re welcome” while Marco tried his best to put the pieces together. She stated that the money was a way to pay Marco back for helping her career. Althoff asked him to count the sum and according to an Instagram post from the pair, the total was $50k.
In that same interview, the host asked Althoff about copying his sarcastic comedic style. 
“I couldn’t take your stuff ’cause I have never seen you, at all,” Althoff said. “I honestly think that we were both kind of doing the same thing a little different and then someone… introduced me to you and was like, ‘You guys are so similar.’ That’s the first I ever heard of you or seen you.”
In addition to accusations of copying Marco’s approach to interviewing subjects, Althoff has also faced criticism for seemingly disrespecting Black music artists in attempts to go viral. She rose to infamy last year when she started hosting The Really Good Podcast, which features interviews with celebrities like Drake, Offset, Lil Yachty and Sukihana.
Althoff rudely inquired about Drake’s relationship with his son and implied he wasn’t a good father (the episode would later be deleted from her platforms). She also ridiculed Lil Yachty by saying the interview she did with him was “super awkward because he’s really kind of awkward.” 
Offset would later become an internet hero when he read Althoff for filth on her own platform after she claimed he didn’t know who he was. Perhaps Althoff gave Marco money out of the goodness of her heart, but it certainly feels like reparations to us.
