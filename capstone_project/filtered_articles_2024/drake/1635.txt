The rivalry between Drake and Kendrick Lamar could be the biggest rap story of 2024. Both are huge stars, and their recent disses have been intense. But none were as shocking as Lamar’s track “Meet the Grahams,” where he claims Drake is hiding a second child—a daughter. This sparked an internet frenzy, with fans trying to track down the alleged child. There was no solid proof, but people remembered that Drake had hidden his first child from the public for a while, so the rumor started to spread.
DJ Akademiks shared something new. He posted a DM dated July 15, 2018, from a woman linked to the rumor. In it, she mentions her daughter, Eternity: “My baby Eternity is five and she really adores you. We have tickets to your LA show, and she just wants to meet you. I’ll pay anything to make it happen for her.”

Akademiks explained that this message shows the woman and Drake didn’t know each other before 2018, making it unlikely he is the father.
Even though Lamar’s camp suggested otherwise, this new info seems to debunk the claim.
