Drake has gotten rid of every social post that fueled his highly-publicized feud with Kendrick Lamar. Fans began to notice some differences on Drizzy's Instagram timeline on Wednesday, June 5. All the posts he made during the height of his beef with K. Dot in May were taken down. Posts that promoted songs like "Family Matters" and "Push Ups" have disappeared from his IG. The Toronto native returned to business as usual by posting his latest sports bets and photos of himself while rocking a Rolex. He also appeared to defend his OVO crew in his latest caption. "The only yes man around me is my Rolex dealer," he wrote. 
It looks like Drake wants to move on from his issues with Kendrick Lamar a couple weeks after the beef dissipated. Both sides appeared to stand down, especially after things started to get crazy over at Drake's Toronto house. Police were called to Drake's mansion several times after Kendrick Lamar included a map of the Bridle Path property on the cover of "Not Like Us."TDE's Anthony "Top" Tiffith declared the battle was over and called it "a win for the culture." Neither artist has directly mentioned each other since then. However, Drake did make a general reference to the beef on Sexyy Red's "U My Everything."Drake's latest move seems ironic, especially since fans believed he accused Metro Boomin of doing the same back in December. Although he removed all traces of the beef from Instagram, it doesn't seem like he's reached complete "tweet and deleter" status just yet. His posts about the diss tracks are still up on X, formerly known as Twitter. Songs like "Push Ups," "Family Matters" and "The Heart Part 6" have yet to be removed.
