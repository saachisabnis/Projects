Iowa's snowmobiling season is just around the corner, and this year, residents will notice one key change thanks to a new law that went into effect on July 1st of this year (2024). If you’re gearing up to ride the snowy trails this winter, here’s everything you need to know about the updated regulations, including what’s new, how to register your snowmobile, and essential safety guidelines for both residents and nonresidents.
One of the biggest changes for Iowa snowmobilers is the elimination of the annual trail user permit for residents. In previous years, Iowa residents had to purchase both a registration and a trail user permit—each costing $15. Now, these fees have been combined into a single annual snowmobile registration fee of $30 (plus administrative fees). This streamlines the process and eliminates the need for a separate permit just for trail access.
Nonresidents, however, are still required to purchase and display a trail user permit to access Iowa trails. Permits are available at any County Recorder’s Office, from authorized retailers, or online at Go Outdoors Iowa.
If you’re an Iowa resident with a snowmobile to register, you’ll need to follow a few steps depending on whether you’re a new or existing owner:
All snowmobile registration and permit fees are allocated to a dedicated account for Iowa’s snowmobile programs. This account supports the Iowa Snowmobile Trail Grant Program, which funds crucial elements like:
In Iowa, safety education is mandatory for younger snowmobile enthusiasts. Riders ages 12 to 17 are required to take a snowmobile education course and carry a valid education certificate when riding on public trails, public land, or public ice. Here’s how the age restrictions break down:
The Iowa DNR Snowmobile Education Program covers safe snowmobiling principles and raises awareness of environmental concerns, responsible land use, and energy conservation. Courses can be taken online, and students must pass a written exam with a score of at least 80% to earn certification. For more information, call DNR Customer Service at 515-725-8200.
In the event of an accident, Iowa snowmobilers must follow specific reporting procedures:
Injury or Property Damage: If a snowmobile accident causes an injury, death, or property damage totaling $1,500 or more, the operator (or someone acting on their behalf) must immediately notify the county sheriff or another local law enforcement agency.
Accidents on Public Land or Trails: If the accident happens on public land, designated trail, or ice sheet under the jurisdiction of the Natural Resource Commission, the operator must submit a report to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) within 72 hours. The report uses DNR Form 542-8093, and should include a complete description of the incident.
