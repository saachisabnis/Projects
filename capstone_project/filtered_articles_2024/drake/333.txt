	It’s YMCMB for life, apparently. Nicki Minaj spoke out in support of Lil Wayne and appeared to take aim at Jay-Z after the NFL passed over Weezy in favor of Kendrick Lamar for the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show.

	With Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, Minaj took issue with Jay — who serves as a co-producer of the NFL Halftime Show — and the league’s decision to overlook her mentor and the Young Money leader, which sparked a fiery rant from the Queens rap legend on Monday afternoon (Sept. 9).

	“Go & enjoy your fkng money b4 it’s too late … One n—a took a knee The other n—a took the bag,” she wrote while subliminally shading Hov. “He gon get you ‘n—-s’ in line every fkng time.”

	She continued: “Got everything in the world. Still spiteful & evil. Disgusting. Be happy Abeg. Go be fkng happy n!gg@!!!!!!!! In rap business. In women business. When you got the Politicians & the police you good tho. Plus dat ugly laughy taffy alien … LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO.”

	Nicki didn’t stop there, as she appeared to blame Jay’s ego and hatred for Birdman, Drake and herself as the reason behind Wayne’s snub.

	“Denying a young black man what he rightfully put into this game for no other reason but your ego. Your hatred for BIRDMAN, Drake & Nicki got you punishing Lil Wayne?!?!!! LIL WAYNE!!!!!!!!!! THE GOAT?!!!!!!!!!!! Nola what’s good,” she wrote. “Eminem stood firm on having 50Cent come out. A white man. S–t sad. House N—-R TINGZ. but it’s GOOD FI DEM!!!!!!! No loyalty ? Welp. then n—-z will keep son’ing you!!!!!”

Birdman even chimed in as the Cash Money president looks to have been disgusted by the NFL’s decision. “Smfh… These n—az Pussi @NICKIMINAJ @Drake @LilTunechi YMCMB,” he added on X. “I’m make these n—az respek us on Gladys… Hatin s–t for real.”

Billboard has reached out to Jay-Z’s reps at Roc Nation for comment.

	The NFL announced on Sunday (Sept. 8) that Kendrick Lamar will serve as the headliner when the big game comes to New Orleans on Feb. 9, 2025.

	Others outside the Young Money family have spoken out in defense of Wayne as well, including Master P, Boosie Badazz, Cam’ron and Mase. Lil Wayne himself is yet to publicly react to the NFL’s move.
