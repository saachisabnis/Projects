Drake has turned an ongoing joke into bars on Sexyy Red‘s latest single, “U My Everything.” 

	On Friday (May 24), the St. Louis rapper released her new single, where Drizzy seamlessly raps over Metro Boomin‘s “BBL Drizzy” diss beat. He actually flips the humorous moniker to dubb himself a BBL investor who’s paid for multiple women to enhance their derriere.  

	“Why you love me? Still a mystery/ Me and the surgeon got history/ I changed a lot of girls’ lives for real/ They need a new body, they hittin’ me/ BBL Drizzy, they want a new body, they ask me for it/ The last one, Jung, he did it for free, ’cause I sent over so many past ones for him,” he raps.

	“U My Everything” is Drake’s second collaboration with Red following their For All the Dogs collab, “Rich Baby Daddy.” The new track hails from Red’s new EP In Sexyy We Trust, which released at midnight.

	










	Metro Boomin released his “BBL Drizzy” diss beat earlier this month, amid their ongoing rap feud. The super-producer not only dropped the beat on his official Sound Cloud account, but also challenged fans to freestyle over the instrumental, offering the winner a free beat from him. Additionally, he added a cash prize of $10,000.

	The loathing nickname came from rumors of Drake getting plastic surgery, which was first coined in Rick Ross’ diss track “Champagne Moments,” to the 6 God. 

	Ahead of the BBL claims, Drake dissed Metro and Ross on diss songs “Family Matters” and “Push Ups” respectively. In the latter he tells Metro, “shut your ho a** up and make some drums, ni**a,” and in the former spits, “What the f**k I heard Rick drop, ni**a?/ Talkin’ somethin’ ’bout a nose job, ni**a/ Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y’all ni**as.”
