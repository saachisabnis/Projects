Yung Miami recently welcomed Rick Ross on her podcast, Caresha Please, where they discussed various aspects of their lives and careers. A significant part of their conversation focused on Ross's ongoing conflict with Drake, which has been a topic in the context of the 2024 Kendrick Lamar battle. During their talk, Ross shared his thoughts on why their friendship deteriorated, how he feels about it, and whether he believes they could reconcile in the future. Given their extensive collaboration over the years, it was a question that had to be addressed.
When Yung Miami asked if the disagreement with Drake was personal or financially motivated, Ross said, "Nah, I’m not going to say it’s business." He emphasized that mentioning his name was unacceptable, especially if it wasn't grounded in reality. Ross expressed his enjoyment of life, being able to appreciate simple moments while listening to music, but noted that not everyone can handle such a mindset.
Yung Miami then asked if Ross would consider reaching out to Drake to resolve their differences, recalling that he had previously helped resolve Drake's feud with Meek Mill. Ross replied, "I don’t know, it depend on how I feel," while reiterating his earlier comments about Drake's plastic surgery. He reflected on how he views loyalty and opportunities in their falling out, indicating that some people do not appreciate what they have.
He continued by explaining that if someone is not truly connected to the streets, they might take situations lightly, which can backfire after a short time. Ross believes many issues could be resolved with a simple phone call, suggesting that misunderstandings often complicate matters. They also touched on Ross's encounter with Drake fans in Vancouver, where he explained his loss and how the outcome could have been much worse for them if he had had better support.
