Original Story: Drake is cooking something up with Arthur Kar for his latest collaboration. Nike NOCTA and L’arte de l’automobile are racing to the finish line with a newly surfaced collaborative capsule.
Known to combine a sporty look to versatile and functional pieces, NOCTA hops into the driver’s seat with L’arte de l’automobile for a collaboration that focuses on the world of automotive. The brand, which is founded by famed Parisian car dealer Arthur Kar, sees a broad range of essentials with the NOCTA and L’arte de l’automobile moniker. Giving a retro racing aesthetic, the collection delivers a selection of t-shirts, hoodies alongside the surfaced bright yellow tech pants, baseball cap, two-toned sock pack and a collaborative blue racing jacket.
The collection has not yet been officially released or announced but it is expected to be dropping later this month. The collection is in tune with Drake’s NOCTA releases in the sports realm, from golf to baseball to basketball, it was only a matter of time for Aubrey to hop on the motocross trend.
