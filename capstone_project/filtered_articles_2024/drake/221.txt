The "Drake curse" may have struck again.

But Usyk ended up winning the fight via split decision. Drake could have taken home $1 million had he won the wager.

The Canadian rapper's latest six-figure loss was used by some fans as another piece of evidence to support the so-called "Drake curse."
Over the years, fans have joked that Drake is "cursed" after many of the sports teams or players he publicly supported or placed bets on ended up losing.
Since 2022, Drake's betting losses have surpassed $5.9 million.
Just two months before his recent $565,000 loss, Drake also lost a $600,000 wager after Francis Ngannou was defeated by Anthony Joshua during their heavyweight showdown in March, according to the Daily Mail.
