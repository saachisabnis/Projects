ARCHER COUNTY, Texas (KAUZ) - New details are emerging from a standoff outside Holliday last night, including the name of the suspect in a double homicide that started the incident.
Texas DPS identified Corey Robert Drake, 28, of Wichita Falls, Texas as the suspect. A Wichita Falls SWAT officer shot and killed Drake last night, ending the standoff.
The victims of the double homicide were Drakeâ€™s grandparents, Fred and Peggy Maier of Holliday. After police responded to the homicide shortly before 3 p.m., Drake opened fire on officers before barricading himself in a barn on the property where he remained for several hours. 
Officers attempted to convince Drake to surrender, including using gas to try and force him out of his position. Drake shot down two police drones from the barn he was barricaded in. 
The Texas Rangers will lead further investigation.
