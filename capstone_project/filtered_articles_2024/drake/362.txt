The Kansas City Chiefs had their bye week in Week 6. If fortune favors them, this won't be their only break, as securing the #1 seed would grant them a bye for the Wild Card round. Following Week 6 of the 2024-25 NFL season, which teams are well-positioned for a playoff run, and which ones might want to start planning their January vacations?
Let's take a look at the standings in the AFC through six weeks.
1. Chiefs (5-0)
2. Chargers (3-2)
3. Broncos (3-3)
4. Raiders (2-4)
1. Bills (4-2)
2. Dolphins (2-3)
3. Jets (2-4)
4. Patriots (1-5)
1. Ravens (4-2)
2. Steelers (4-2)
3. Bengals (2-4)
4. Browns (1-5)
1. Texans (5-1)
2. Colts (3-3)
3. Titans (1-4)
4. Jaguars (1-5)
In London, the Bears thrashed the Jaguars. The Colts secured a crucial road victory against the Titans. Drake Maye's NFL debut was spoiled as the Texans left Foxborough with a resounding win. The Browns' offensive struggles continued, resulting in another loss. In the DMV battle, the Ravens triumphed over the Commanders.
The Chargers dominated the Broncos, securing a more decisive victory than the final score suggested. T.J. Watt's stellar performance propelled the Steelers to a win over the Raiders. In a defensive showdown on Sunday Night Football, the Bengals emerged victorious against the Giants. Meanwhile, the Bills triumphed over the Jets in a penalty-ridden contest on Monday Night Football.
Doug Pederson's job may in serious trouble if the Jaguars fall to the Patriots in London on Sunday morning. The Colts stay in playoff contention while Will Levis' opportunities dwindle in Tennessee. Drake Maye showed potential, but his less-than-mediocre supporting cast struggled against the Texans' dominant pass rush.
 In Cleveland, Kevin Stefanski faces mounting pressure to bench Deshaun Watson to maintain locker room support. Meanwhile, the Ravens' offense continues its elite performance, with Lamar Jackson building a compelling case for a third MVP award.
The Chargers displayed potential as Wild Card contenders, while the Broncos' lackluster offense seems insufficient for a playoff run. T.J. Watt has emerged as the leading candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, and the Raiders show signs of unraveling. 
Although the Bengals' defense finally performed well, facing Daniel Jones leaves questions about its long-term consistency. The Bills' defense remains uncertain, and Josh Allen's favorable turnover luck may soon shift. Despite coaching changes, the Jets continue to grapple with offensive challenges.
According to Team Rankings, the Chiefs remain the favorites to secure the AFC's #1 seed with a 56.9% chance. Follow them are the Bills at 12.2%, while the Texans and Ravens are next at 11.6% and 8.0%, respectively. The Steelers (5.9%) and Chargers (3.5%) both have an outside shot.
The Chiefs still lead the AFC in Super Bowl LIX odds with a 18.4% chance, followed by the Bills at 8.8% and Ravens at 8.0%. Other top contenders include the Texans (4.5%), Steelers (4.0%), and Chargers (2.2%).
The Chiefs likely used their bye week to address inefficiencies in their passing game and red zone offense. Their strong start has provided some margin for error. Beating the Ravens before Baltimore's hot streak gives KC the tiebreaker. Apart from Houston, whom they'll face at Arrowhead in December, every other AFC team has at least two losses.
Kansas City's schedule eases after their Week 7 game against the 49ers. They'll play the Raiders and Broncos twice each, host the Chargers, and visit the Panthers and Browns. While they'll also face the Buccaneers and Texans at home, plus the Bills and Steelers on the road, the Chiefs should aim to finish the season with no more than four losses. A win in Week 7 could set a realistic floor of 14-3.
However, the team still has offensive issues to resolve. They showed promise against the Saints, despite struggling in the red zone. If they can build on that momentum, combined with their strong defense, the Chiefs should be extremely tough to beat.
