Shortly after making its premiere, Ye’s remix of Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That” is now available to stream.
Listeners can officially stream three-minute cut via YouTube and Ye’s YEEZY.com. The VULTURES artist initially debuted the track with Justin LaBoy on The Download, and hears him publicly declare which side of the ongoing beef he’s on. “It’s a wrap for n***as / Where’s Lucian, serve your master, n***a / You caught a little bag for your masters didn’t ya / Lifetime deal, I feel bad for n***as,” West raps as he fires at Drake before taking aim at J. Cole, “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind / I can’t even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole, get the p*ssy dry.” After revealing his verse, he also took to social media to share an NSFW meme supporting his bars against Cole.
“You know we had to get the hooligans up here to get these p*ssy n***as out / Yo Dot, I got you,” Ye vehemently proclaims as he takes Kendrick Lamar‘s side.
