Luther College has become one of 80 new members of the FirstGen Forward Network, formerly known as the Center for First-generation Student Success. Among Iowa institutions, Luther joins the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and Drake University in the 429-member nationwide network. 
To be selected as a FirstGen Forward Network Member, Luther College displayed a demonstrated commitment to improving experiences and advancing success for first-generation college students.  
The FirstGen Forward Network empowers higher education institutions to benefit first-generation college students in many ways, such as advancing their academic and co-curricular outcomes and building more inclusive institutional structures. First-generation students are those whose parents or guardians have not completed a 4-year college degree. They come to college with a unique set of strengths as well as challenges. At Luther College, 21 percent of the student body was first generation as of last fall.

“We are very honored to have been selected for membership in the FirstGen Forward Network, and we are excited to maximize the opportunities this partnership will allow,” said Kate Elliott, Luther’s dean of student success. “I want to publicly commend my team in the Office of Student Success, especially Dr. Ann Smith, assistant dean and director of disability services, and Dr. Jennifer Hanifl, director of TRIO Student Support Services.”
“We are pleased to welcome Luther College into the network,” said Sarah E. Whitley, executive vice president with FirstGen Forward. “Through the application process, it was evident that Luther College is not only taking steps to serve first-generation students but is prepared to make a long-term commitment and employ strategies that foster an environment of success for this important population.”
“Being named as a Network Member in the FirstGen Forward Network is an exciting opportunity for Luther College to join a dedicated community of professionals prepared to share evidence-based practices and resources, troubleshoot challenges, generate knowledge, and continue to advance the success of first-generation students across the country,” said Maurice Jones, CEO of FirstGen Forward. “We are excited to see a groundswell of activity from the Class of 2024 Network Members and know Luther College will be a significant contributor.”
Jennifer Hanifl, director of TRIO Student Support Services
A commitment to first-generation college students is personal for several key Luther staff members. Smith and Hanifl, as well as Provost Brad Chamberlain, were all first-generation college students in their own families. Smith and Hanifl will serve as Luther’s leadership team for FirstGen Forward. “Because of our personal experience as first-gen students, we are especially excited about this program and the resources it will bring to help our current generation of first-gen students,” said Hanifl. 
Both Hanifl and Smith have extensive professional experience working with the first-generation population. Before Luther, Hanifl was the director of the first-generation initiatives student program at Saint Mary’s University in Winona, Minn. As Luther’s director of TRIO Student Support Services, she serves first-generation college students, as well as income-eligible students and students with disabilities. Ann Smith supports TRIO in her role as assistant dean and works directly with providing services for students with disabilities at Luther. Luther has an over 50-year history with the federally funded TRIO programs.  
At the 2024 TRIO Student Support Services banquet, students show the community they have formed in the program.
First-generation students in TRIO SSS are more likely to persist in their education, compared to their peers not in the program, largely because of TRIO’s support services. Based on federal funding levels, however, Luther’s TRIO program is able to serve less than half of Luther’s eligible first-gen students. “Of the 216 first-generation college students at Luther College in spring 2024, only 91 first-gens (approximately 42%) were served by the TRIO Student Support Services program,” said Hanifl. “The FirstGen Forward program will allow us to have nationwide support for more programming opportunities and, hopefully, funding to build out support for first-gens not in TRIO.”
She envisions programming such as persistence and academic recovery workshops, community-building, mentoring and networking geared toward first-generation students. “We will spend time digging deeper into what the students’ needs are,” Hanifl said. 
The FirstGen Forward program has three phases. After successful completion of the Network Member phase, institutions may progress to the second phase, FirstGen Forward Network Leader. Ultimately, all network institutions strive for national leadership as a FirstGen Forward Network Champion.
Hanifl is excited to work toward the champion phase of the network. 
“It’s all about creating community,” Hanifl said. “Luther is a wonderful community, but everyone needs a niche or group of their own. That’s what we are trying to create. Everyone needs a cohort or a family and a place that they can call their home away from home.”
