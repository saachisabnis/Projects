The Argentina national team took a playful jab at embattled Drake after the Toronto superstar took an “L” after losing a hefty $300,000 bet when Canada fell 2-0. 
Argentina’s win in the hugely popular Copa América semifinal on Tuesday was followed by a post on “X,” formerly Twitter, riffing off rival rapper Kendrick Lamar’s summer anthem—yes, you know it—“Not Like Us.” I guess Argentina was sending a message to Drizzy or chasing clout. Take your pick.
Curious, we get it’s all in jest, but who will tell them?
And why come for Drake? The 6 God posted his bet on the gram, where had Canada won, it would have netted him $2.88 million. Drake’s public gambling has been on the downside of luck lately after a few high-profile plays, as they are called in the sports betting world, didn’t go as planned. 
Goals from Julián Álvarez and Lionel Messi ensured the bad luck continued for Drake, securing Argentina moves on in the tournament.
Argentina is gunning for a record 16th Copa América title, and in Sunday’s final match, it will face either Uruguay or Colombia.
I wonder if Drake’s money is on any of the remaining teams or if he’s been gone for a while.
