Drake just wanted to chill. That’s all. In text to Akademiks, Drake revealed he just wanted to come off tour and relax but now he has to beef with the world, which he intends to win.
On a stream, AK read a text Drake sent him. “Ak, you know I was trying to come off tour and relax,” the blogger says the text reads. “”N–gas done f**ked up my whole feng shui. Now I gotta eat until this debate is done.”

Since Kendrick Lamar has yet to respond to “Push Ups,” Drake has gone back to back. Hitting Instagram, The 6ix God dropped off the “Taylor Made Freestyle.”
Upon pressing play you will hear something that you wouldn’t expect, Tupac’s voice.The single opens with an AI Tupac verse requesting KDot stands up for the West Coast. It is followed by an AI Snoop Dogg asking for the same.
AI Tupac raps:Fuck this Canadian lightskin, DotWe need an undebated West Coast victory, manCall him a bitch for meTalk about him liking young girls, that’s a gift from meHeard it on the Budden Podcast, it’s gotta be trueThey told me the spirit of Makaveli is aliveIn the nigga under five-foot five, so it’s gotta be you
AI Snoop added:‘Cause right now it’s looking like you writing out the game plan on how to loseHow to bark up the wrong tree and then get your head popped in a crowded roomWorld is watching this chess game, but are you out of moves?
After that, Drake pops in for his own slick talk:The first one really only took me an hour or twoThe next one is really ’bout to bring out the coward in youBut now we gotta wait a fucking week ’cause Taylor Swift is your new TopAnd if you ’bout to drop, she gotta approveSince “Like That,” your tone changed a little, you not as enthusedHow are you not in the booth? It feel like you kinda removedYou tryna let this shit die down, nah, nah, nahNot this time, nigga, you followin’ through
He ends the song with a message, “I know you’re in that NY apartment, you struggling right now I know it.”
