DJ Akademiks and Metro Boomin have been in a war of words for years. The latest round in their beef included Ak using deceased relatives as ammunition.
“@MetroBoomin. You a b#### ass n####. Don’t like s### bout me you hoe ass n####… every time I violated [you]… [you] basically ran and tuck your tail,” Akademiks tweeted on Saturday (December 30).
The Off The Record podcast host then posted, “@MetroBoomin your b#### ass ain’t respond to Drake… [You] a known hoe.. go mourn in peace [you] s#######.”
Metro Boomin seemed to be feuding with Drake in recent weeks before downplaying having any issues with the OVO leader. Ak’s “go mourn in peace” statement appeared to be a reference to Metro’s mother’s tragic death in 2022.
.@MetroBoomin You a a b#### ass n####. Dont like s### bout me you hoe ass n####… everytime i violated u … u basically ran and tuck your tail..
.@MetroBoomin your b#### ass aint respond to drake… u a known hoe.. go mourn in peace u s#######.
“@MetroBoomin, you a sucka n####… tweet [and] deleter.. .a true pure 100% [fish scale] p####. [Sensitive] beatmaker who [throws] stones and [hides your] hand… Keep mourning [you] b#### ass n#### and keep my f*cking name out of [your] likes and mentions,” Ak continued.
Allegedly, Metro liked a tweet about Akademiks’s domestic dispute with his ex-girlfriend. Ziya Abashe accused Ak and associates of sexual assault. He has denied those allegations.
Akademiks also wrote, “@MetroBoomin remember you the same b#### ass n#### who made No Jumper pull [an] interview [with] you because your sensitive ass didn’t change your tampon that damn day… your ass should be in the studio making beats and stay [the f###] off Twitter/Instagram/YT.”
In addition, DJ Akademiks and Metro Boomin clashed online in 2020. A dispute over Ak’s coverage of the Missouri-born producer led to Metro demanding the blogger stop covering him.
.@MetroBoomin you a sucka n####… tweet a deleter.. .a True pure 100% fishcale p####. Sensistive beatmaker who throw stones and hide ur hand…. Keep mourning u b#### ass n#### and keep my f*cking name out of ur likes and mentions.
