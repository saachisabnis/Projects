Five Texas Rangers A ball players are being promoted, the team has announced
The Texas Rangers have announced a handful of promotions involving minor leaguers today, with the promotions going into effect on Tuesday, when the full season leagues resume play.
Low-A Down East pitchers Alejandro Rosario and Kohl Drake and third baseman Gleider Figuereo have been promoted to high-A Hickory.
High-A Hickory pitchers Winston Santos and Skylar Hales have been promoted to AA Frisco.
No announcements as of now in regards to whether any players will be promoted from Frisco to AAA Round Rock.
The promotions of Rosario and Drake were, I think, expected, and the Rosario news leaked yesterday on Twitter.  We wrote about Rosario three weeks ago today, when he was named the Carolina League Pitcher of the Week.  The 22 year old righthander was the Rangers’ 5th round pick out of the University of Miami in 2023, where he had very disappointing numbers despite quality stuff.  In 47 innings over 10 starts for Down East this season, Rosario has put up a 2.11 ERA while striking out 69 batters, walking just five, and allowing two home runs.  He has definitely earned his promotion.
Kohl Drake has, arguably, been even more impressive at Down East than Rosario.  In 43 innings over 10 appearances, Drake has put up a 1.67 ERA with 71 strikeouts against 9 walks, with two homers allowed.  Drake also was pressed into duty at Frisco when they were shorthanded earlier this year and was less successful, allowing four runs while walking six in 1.1 IP.  The lefthander, who turns 24 next month, was the Rangers’ 11th round pick out of Walters State Community College in 2022.  Walters State also produced former major league lefties Chad Bell and Brett Martin, both of whom were drafted by Texas.
Winston Santos was repeating at Hickory after a disappointing 2023 campaign, and his performance this year is such that it was a matter of when, not if, he would get the in-season promotion.  Santos, a righthander who turned 22 in April, has a 2.80 ERA in 64 innings over 12 appearances, striking out 81 and walking 20.  
Skylar Hales, 22, was the Rangers’ fourth round pick out of Santa Clara in 2023.  A righty reliever, Hales has a 4.39 ERA in 26.2 IP over 20 appearances, with 35 Ks against 9 walks.  He had a couple of disaster outings in mid-April where he gave up 8 runs in 1.1 IP.  Since then, he’s had a 2.18 ERA over 20.2 IP.
The promotions of the four pitchers were all, I think, expected.  I was not expecting Gleider Figuereo to be promoted, and was surprised to see his name on the list.  The lefthanded hitting third baseman, who turns 20 in three days, was repeating low-A, having put up a .220/.300/.423 slash line for Down East in 2023.  
Figuereo’s numbers are generally solid — he is slashing .244/.346/.474 with 12 home runs in 269 plate appearances — but they didn’t appear, at first blush, to warrant a promotion, particularly given that he has struck out 74 times this year.  However, the Carolina League as a whole is slashing just .229/.324/.338, and Down East is one of the more pitcher-friendly parks in the Carolina League.  Among qualified hitters, Figuereo is second in the league in home runs (behind a 24 year old who has 14), 9th in slugging, and 18th in OPS.  
I would assume that a couple of pitchers would be in line to be promoted from AA Frisco to AAA Round Rock, given that Santos and Hales are moving up.  Among the starters, the most likely candidates would be Dane Acker and Emiliano Teodo.  
Acker is a 25 year old righty who was a 4th round pick out of Oklahoma in 2020, and who came to Texas in the Elvis Andrus/Jonah Heim trade.  He has a 3.00 ERA in 54 innings over 12 starts for Frisco this year after putting up a 2.74 ERA in 46 innings for Frisco in 2023.  Given his age and number of appearances he’s had at AA, Round Rock would seem to make sense for him.
Teodo, 23, is a righthander with an electric arm who seems likely to be a reliever in the long-term, but who is currently starting for Frisco.  He had a shaky season in 2023, when he spent all year in Frisco, but has a 2.06 ERA in 56 innings over 12 starts this year at AA, with 72 Ks against 31 walks.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Teodo was moved up now, but also wouldn’t be surprised if they had him make a few more starts in Frisco before challenging him at the AAA level.
If the Rangers promote a reliever from Frisco, Robby Ahlstrom would seem to be the most likely choice.  A 25 year old lefthander who was a 7th round pick of the Yankees in 2021, Ahlstrom was acquired by Texas in the Jose Trevino trade.  After starting the 2023 season at Hickory, Ahlstrom was promoted mid-season to Frisco, where he put up a 3.81 ERA in 26 innings over 18 appearances.  This year, Ahlstrom has thrown 29 innings over 19 appearances, striking out 42, walking 18 and putting up a 2.17 ERA.  Over his last 9 appearances, he has thrown 13.1 innings, allowed one run, struck out 18 and walked five.
