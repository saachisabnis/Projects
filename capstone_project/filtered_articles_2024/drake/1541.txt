It may not be the response format fans wanted, but it is something.

	People have been waiting to hear from Drake ever since about 12:25 a.m. on Friday (March 22); the time that they heard Kendrick Lamar go at him on “Like That” from Future and Metro Boomin’s latest album, We Don’t Trust You. The Toronto superstar shared his thoughts on the matter during his latest show on the It’s All A Blur – Big As The What? Tour.

	On Sunday evening (March 24), Drizzy hosted his second show at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Fla. It was supposed to be a happy time as he reunited with Lil Wayne for select shows while J. Cole is elsewhere. However, fans cited that he rapped certain bars on “Energy” and “Nonstop” with more passion than usual. 

	










	Finally, he cut the music and expressed himself in one of the many passionate speeches he’d made during shows on this tour. “A lot of people asking me how I’m feelin’,” he said before telling fans he wants them to feel how he felt at the time. “I got my head up high, my back straight. I’m 10 f**king toes down in Florida or anywhere else I go. And I know no matter what there’s not a ni**a on this Earth that could ever f**k with me in my life.” He closed by saying to move toward the future, sometimes one has to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, seeming as if he was cueing up the next song in his setlist.

	Now, of course, this wasn’t the Drake response people hoped for. Rap purists, Kendrick Lamar fans, and the Hip-Hop community overall hoped that he would release a diss record by now given how quickly he moved in his 2015 beef with Meek Mill or 2018 beef with Kanye West and Pusha T. 

	The internet attempted to manufacture more pressure for the For All The Dogs rapper. Footage surfaced online of a fan yelling “Yo Drake, Kendrick’s better!” while outside waiting for him to leave a hotel. Fans quickly pointed out that there was a Christmas tree in the video and that it looked like he was in New York City, which would not line up with his current Sunrise, Fla. stops. 

	As if that wasn’t enough, social media detectives also discovered that Nav and Rick Ross, both of whom have collaborated with Future, Metro Boomin, and Drake, no longer follow the five-time Grammy winner on Instagram. The St. Louis producer tweeted “Once you pick a side stay there” on Thursday (March 21), and it has led many fans to believe there is a civil war brewing within Hip-Hop.

once you pick a side stay there.. #WEDONTTRUSTYOU

	All of this commotion began after Kendrick Lamar targeted both Drake and J. Cole on “Like That” from Future and Metro Boomin’s album, We Don’t Trust You. The elusive Compton rapper said “Motherf**k the Big 3, ni**a, it’s just big me,” likened himself to Prince and said he outlived Michael Jackson, whom the 6 God often likens himself to, and used clever wordplay related to Drake’s latest album For All The Dogs to say he and his allies would end up in a pet cemetery.

	K. Dot wasn’t throwing shots alone, though. Throughout the album, Metro utilized audio clips where the late Prodigy calls out wack rappers and says people do not listen to them in the hood. In the opening title track, Future himself repeats “Fake written all over you, hate written all over you,” calls an unnamed person his No. 1 fan and refers to having tension with that same person over a woman. 

	Those internet detectives got to work again over the weekend, looking back at Drizzy’s record “What Would Pluto Do” and theorizing that it was a diss toward the Atlanta rapper instead of paying homage. Many people believe they have been distant since their 2022 records “Wait For U” and “I’m On One” because they had a falling out over engaging with the same woman. Beyond that, people reflected on N.O.R.E’s claim that Future was upset with Drake for putting out Her Loss with 21 Savage in November 2022, claiming that it made their 2015 collaborative album What A Time To Be Alive less important. 
If “What Would Pluto Do” is really a track about Drake trying to overcome the mental gymnastics before ultimately deciding to sleep with the same girl he last seen Future with….Then he might be the pettiest human to ever live + this beef has just begun ?

	As for Metro Boomin, he and Drake have seemingly been engaged in a cold war for over a year now. When a version of his song “Trance” featuring the Toronto rapper leaked online, Metro followed up by releasing a version of “Knife Talk” that had none of his verses. Toward the end of 2023, Metro tweeted and deleted a complaint about Heroes & Villains being left out of award nominations while Her Loss racked up a bunch of them. 

	










	This is one big, unclear mess that the fans are loving. Time will tell if Drake sets the record straight with a response record any time soon, or at all.
