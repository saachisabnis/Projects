"This has nothing to do with him, period"
Drake‘s father has fired back at Joe Budden after the broadcaster went on a tirade over the rapper’s recent lawsuits against Universal Music Group (UMG).
Last month, the Canadian hitmaker filed two lawsuits against his label UMG over ‘Not Like Us’ – a diss track by Kendrick Lamar aimed at Drake which called him “a certified paedophile”. The first alleged the label “artificially inflated” the song’s streaming numbers and the other accused them of allowing the release of a defamatory song targeting one of their signees.
When the news broke, Budden swiftly commented on the ongoing cases on his infamous Joe Budden Podcast. When one of the co-hosts suggested that Drake is facing “‘adversity for the first time in 15 years,” the ‘Pump It Up’ rapper rebutted: “Or he’s a selfish, lying, manipulative sack of shit who has made enemies for 15 years, and now we’re here at the fucking boiling point.”

“You’ve been behind the scenes being the biggest sack of shit you can possibly be,” Budden continued. “N****s know what it is out here – and he’s fucking white and he’s Jewish and he had too much dip on his chip. You have been behind the scenes hitting n****s’ baby moms, sending money to n****s’ baby moms, been sending messages to this n****’s wife…”
Budden said he believed Drake’s supposed bad behaviour went on for so long because he got fans and Lucien Grainge – the chairman and chief executive officer of UMG – to protect him. “Everybody just turns a blind eye,” he added, “but the blind days are done.”
A clip of Budden’s rant was posted to Instagram and Drake’s father Dennis Graham defended his son in the comment section beneath. Graham first wrote, “Stand down now!!!!!!” then followed up with a warning for the New Yorker: “Joe needs to back the fuck off. This has nothing to do with him, period.”

Budden and Drake also engaged in a rap “beef” last year after the release of Drake’s latest album, ‘For All The Dogs’. The broadcaster felt like the Torontonian was “rapping for the children” and wanted “to hear adult Drake rapping for adult people”.
 Drake replied to Budden on Instagram, writing in a long, scathing passage: “You withdrew from rap not cause you accomplished all you need to it’s cause it wasn’t working for you.”
The podcast host also said Drake was “talking shit about, ‘this n****’s mom died’” – leading many to think the ‘Hotline Bling’ star may have made insensitive comments about Metro Boomin’s mother who was tragically murdered by her spouse in June 2022.
Boomin recently spoke about his feud with Drake, saying: “Me and [Drake], we had a personal issue, and for the record, not over no girl or nothing silly like that. It was a personal issue that really hurt me and disappointed me.”
Drake also had rivalries with the likes of The Weeknd, Future, A$AP Rocky, Rick Ross and more – all of whom he exchanged shots with various songs throughout this year. His most prolific and infamous rap battle was with Kendrick Lamar, which resulted in many scathing allegations against both rappers and culminated with Lamar’s anthemic Number One single, ‘Not Like Us’.
Meanwhile, Drake announced he will be returning to Australia and New Zealand for the ‘Anita Max Win Tour’. It will kick off on February 9 next year – the same date his recent foe Lamar will be headlining the NFL Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans.
