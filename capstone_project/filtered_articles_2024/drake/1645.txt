 Same. Loved Michael but KD3 was truly something special. With that said i’m fully prepared to be angry as hell when Travis Scott’s name is called. 
Utopia was also a good album, i listened to it a lot but i don’t think it’s winning despite Travis Scott’s popularity. My choice for rage is Her Loss, that album was Misogny 101 with Drake.

Y’all think SZA can pull a surprise win in Melodic Rap ?
Since the re-introduction of Rap Performance in 2012, there hasn’t been a split in the rap field (meaning a case where Song A wins Rap Performance or Melodic over Song B but Song B wins Rap Song over Song A). I personally think Rich Flex and Scientists & Engineers are the only contenders with an actual shot in Rap Song so due to the aforementioned I will be predicting one of them to win both their categories.
Deciding which one of Rich Flex or Scientists & Engineers it will be is a little more hard. Rich Flex is the biggest hit by far in the lineups but Killer Mike performed great in noms, only missing Melodic Rap where he had two submissions by the way, and appeals to what I call “the Jay-Z voters” (basically old hip-hop heads). I also think Andre 3000’s name will attract a lot of voters. I am leaning towards the latter but Drake x 21 Savage does have a valid chance.

I actually thought Utopia was a massive let down compared to his previous work but i’ll readily say i’m not necessarily the target audience for Travis Scott so i’ll refrain from further criticism

If there is SZA fever, then yes. “All My Life” just seems like a Grammy-level song, but I think it’s beatable.

Honey, I mentioned in the Predictions thread that SZA might win Best Melodic Rap Performance.  Despite “All My Life” being favored, there is NOT a frontrunner.
Giving Lil Durk a Grammy is easily avoidable and they choose Kanye’s songs over J. Cole’s just 2 years ago. SZA has a solid chance.

If SZA wins Melodic Rap, then she is probably coming for 5-6 awards. 
Is anyone predicting something like this?
Rap Performance – “Scientists & Engineers”
Rap Song – “Scientists & Engineers”
Melodic Rap Performance – “Low”
Rap Album – Utopia
Honey, I would be shook if “Scientists & Engineers” pulled off wins over bigger names (Drake & 21 Savage, Kendrick Lamar).  I’m thinking:
Best Rap Performance – “The Hillbillies”
Best Melodic Rap Performance – “Low”
Best Rap Song – “Rich Flex”
Best Rap Album – Her Loss

These are my Predix too

I can’t see Killer Mike beating Kendrick Lamar in Rap Performance, even with Andre 3000 on his side. I think if ANY category is sure to be a lock its Kendrick and Keem walking away with Best Rap Peformance.
as of right now I have it
Best Rap Song- Scientists & Engineers
Best Rap Performance- The Hillbillies
Best Melodic Rap Performance- All My Life
Best Rap Album- Utopia (although i’m praying to God, Allah, AND Buddha that Nas wins)
how come ‘the hillbillies’ lost out on a best rap song nomination? that’s what’s holding me back from preidcting it to win in performance over drake/21 savage and killer mike
Yeah, looking at all the Rap Performance winners since 2012, all had Rap Song nominations as well – except “Bubblin” which won in a tie with “King’s Dead.” But if anyone can beat that stat, it’s Kendrick. 
I’m hoping “Scientists & Engineers” wins.  It’d be funny if Drake/21 Savage lose everything, despite being the most nominated.

Anything can happen; no one is a lock in any category.
