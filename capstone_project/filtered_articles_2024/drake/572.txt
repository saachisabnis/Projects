Luxurious Entertainment, an L.A.-based independent hip-hop label, is set to release 100 songs over the next 12 months. Riding the wave of West Coast hip-hop’s resurgence—marked by Kendrick Lamar’s triumph over Drake, DJ Mustard’s return, and the new release from Drakeo The Ruler—the label is gaining significant attention.
The music company is drawing comparisons to iconic names like Death Row Records and TDE, with rumors even suggesting that the label is secretly funded by a certain former CEO (who is currently serving time in a California prison). Coverage in top publications such as The Source, XXL, ThisIs50, Complex, HipHopSince1987, and Billboard highlights their growing influence, with their Instagram (@Luxurious.Entertainment) nearing 200K followers.
Feezy Lebron, a standout artist on their roster, has garnered over 32 million total streams with notable collaborations that include Lil Baby, Gunna, Wiz Khalifa, and 2 Chainz. Other talents on the label include Sweetie Hunndos, a rapper, model, and reality TV personality, and the gritty LA rap artist DeeDawgBby.
CEO and artist EveryoneLovesIce leads a skilled team of industry professionals and has secured partnerships with the popular streetwear brand Focus Rich Clothing and World Star Distro, a division of WorldStar Hip Hop, which has scored gold and platinum hits with Ice Spice and Lil Donald. The recording label also collaborates with music supervisors to place tracks in TV, film, and games, broadening their industry impact.
Luxurious Entertainment’s plan to release over 100 songs in the next 12 months stems from their dedication to maintaining momentum and visibility in the competitive hip-hop landscape. By consistently dropping new music, they aim to keep their audience engaged and attract new listeners. The label’s strategic alliance with World Star Distro and robust infrastructure enable them to handle such a high volume of releases effectively.
Upcoming releases from the music imprint include EveryoneLovesIce’s “Keep It Westside” with Young Buck, Snoopy Bad Azz, and Crip Mac, and “Put It Up” featuring San Quinn, Feezy Lebron, and Yhung T.O. The record company promises to release more collaborations in the following months with heavyweights like Snoop Dogg, Blueface, Boosie Badazz, Lil Wayne, Nipsey Hussle, The Game, and Shoreline Mafia.Follow Luxurious Entertainment on Instagram (@Luxurious.Entertainment) and visit www.LuxuriousEntertainment.com for more updates.
