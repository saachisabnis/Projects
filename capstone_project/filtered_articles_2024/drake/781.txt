Jay Electronica has seemingly weighed in on the ongoing beefs between rappers with not one, but two, cryptic posts.
The Louisiana native took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday (April 13) to share the two posts.

In the first, he wrote, “goodnight & good luck.” In the second, he shared a clip from a film wherein the protagonist says, “are you telling me that 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation?”
Check out both posts below.
Jay Electronica seemed to be referring to Rick Ross’s recent diss track called “Champagne Moments,” which takes direct aim at Drake.
DJ Akademiks premiered the diss track on his podcast on Saturday (April 13), with the Biggest Bawse teasing its drop on X, formerly known as Twitter, before unleashing it on the world.

“It’s the 1st qtr. This is going to be a good game. Grab a seat,” he wrote. “Perfect day to boss up.”
Ross then unleashed the full fury on the 6 God, accusing him of getting a nose job to appear less Black, spitting: “You ain’t never want to be a n-gga anyway, n-gga/ That’s why you had a operation to make your nose smaller than your father nose, n-gga.”

The track goes on to explain why the former collaborators fell out in the first place: “I unfollowed you, n-gga, ’cause you sent the motherfucking cease-and-desist to French Montana, n-gga/ You sent the police, n-gga, hatin’ on my dog project/ That wasn’t the same white boy that I seen, n-gga, when we were makin’ them early records, n-gga/ When you were happy to be around n-ggas, seein’ n-ggas holdin’ them sticks/ Yeah/ You owe motherfucking Stunna your life, n-gga.”
Drake has been in the hot seat over the past few weeks as a number of his A-list peers have taken shots at him, and a response that has been confirmed to be by him is now making the rounds online.

Drake also replied to Rick Ross’s diss by posting a text conversation between himself and his mother, which makes reference to the nose job insult.
“I would have gotten us a 2 for 1 deal if I went, Ma,” he wrote to his mother, before returning the insult back to Ross, captioning the post, “@richforever you’re one nosy goof.”
