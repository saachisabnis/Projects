A new grassroots coalition has formed in response to what it calls a major conservative threat to voters’ rights in Oakland and Alameda County, bluntly calling itself: “Respect Our Vote – No Recalls.”  “We already voted!  We shouldn’t have to pay for another expensive election because a handful of multi-millionaires from Piedmont and San Francisco, along with a few billionaires across the country, don’t like the results of the election we already had,” said longtime Oakland activist Mariano Contreras, reflecting a sentiment of some politically aware residents from many groups and neighborhoods across Oakland.

A new grassroots coalition has formed in response to what it calls a major conservative threat to voters’ rights in Oakland and Alameda County, bluntly calling itself: “Respect Our Vote – No Recalls.”



“We already voted!  We shouldn’t have to pay for another expensive election because a handful of multi-millionaires from Piedmont and San Francisco, along with a few billionaires across the country, don’t like the results of the election we already had,” said longtime Oakland activist Mariano Contreras, reflecting a sentiment of some politically aware residents from many groups and neighborhoods across Oakland.
While outside monied interests are paying for the recalls, other recall backers include supporters of those who lost the last election and those who are opposed to progressive reforms, according to anti-recall organizers.
“I can disagree with some actions of an elected official, but I want them to serve out their term and carry out the programs they ran on. I can vote for someone else next time if I don’t like what they are doing,” said Servant BK Woodson.
“Time is short, and it is important to mobilize now to defend our rights to pick the leaders of our choice. Early voting starts in less than 70 days, and Election Day is Nov. 5,” said Pamela Drake.TrendingBoko Haram Crisis: Nigeria Begins Sambisa Ground Offensive
“Our opponents are well funded, they utilize MAGA talking points, and have no respect for the truth. They are backed by corporate media. We have to make ourselves aware of what is really going on and mobilize with people power,” said attorney Walter Riley.
Among those throwing their energies into the coalition are representatives of labor unions, the faith community, nonprofit organizations, local Democratic clubs, African American community organizations, Asian and Pacific Islander organizations, teachers, and others.
“Respect Our Vote – No recalls” is holding a meeting at Allen Temple Baptist Church, 8501 International Boulevard, Oakland, on Saturday, Aug. 17 at 1 p.m.

“I accept your choice with a deep sense of responsibility, humility, and love. Oakland is a deeply divided City,” Lee said in an April 19 statement. “I answered the call to run to unite our community, so that I can represent every voter, and we can all work together as One Oakland to solve our most pressing problems.”

 As a candidate for mayor, former U.S. Representative Barbara Lee released a “10-point plan” last week to reassure residents that she will tackle Oakland’s most pressing challenges.



Now that she has edged out her competitors in the ranked-choice special election with 50% or more of the vote, the former Congresswoman, who represented parts of the Bay Area in the U.S. House of Representatives, can put her vision in motion as the city’s first Black woman mayor.
“I accept your choice with a deep sense of responsibility, humility, and love. Oakland is a deeply divided City,” Lee said in an April 19 statement. “I answered the call to run to unite our community, so that I can represent every voter, and we can all work together as One Oakland to solve our most pressing problems.”
On Saturday evening, Taylor conceded to Lee. There are still about 300 Vote-by-Mail ballots left to be verified, according to county election officials. The ballots will be processed on April 21 and April 22.
“This morning, I called Congresswoman Barbara Lee to congratulate her on becoming the next Mayor of Oakland,” Taylor said in a statement.
“I pray that Mayor-Elect Lee fulfills her commitment to unify Oakland by authentically engaging the 47% of Oaklanders who voted for me and who want pragmatic, results-driven leadership.”TrendingBlack Press, NAACP, and Lawmakers Warned America—Now Trump’s Project 2025 Agenda is Reality
The influential Oakland Post endorsed Lee’s campaign, commending her leadership on the local, state, and federal levels.
Paul Cobb, The Post’s publisher, told California Black Media that Lee will bring back “respect and accountability” to the mayor’s office.
“She is going to be a collegial leader drawing on the advice of community nonprofit organizations and those who have experience in dealing with various issues,” Cobb said. “She’s going to try to do a consensus-building thing among those who know the present problems that face the city.”
Born in El Paso, Texas, Lee’s family moved to California while she was in high school. At 20 years old, Lee divorced her husband after the birth of her first child. After the split, Lee went through a tough period, becoming homeless and having to apply for public assistance to make ends meet.
But destitution did not deter the young woman.
Lee groomed herself to become an activist and advocate in Oakland and committed to standing up for the most vulnerable citizens in her community.
Lee traveled to Washington, D.C. to work for then U.S. Congressman Ron Dellums after receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mills College in Oakland in 1973. Lee later won a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) fellowship to attend the School of Social Welfare, and she earned a Master of Social Work from the University of California-Berkeley in 1975.
Lee later served in the California State Assembly and State Senate before she was elected to Congress in 1998.
After serving in the U.S. Congress for more than 25 years, Lee ran unsuccessfully for California’s U.S. Senate in the 2024 primary election.
Lee joins current Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed as Black women serving as chief executives of major cities in California over the last few years.

Born in El Paso, Texas, Lee’s family moved to California while she was in high school. At 20 years old, Lee divorced her husband after the birth of her first child. After the split, Lee went through a tough period, becoming homeless and having to apply for public assistance to make ends meet.
But destitution did not deter the young woman.
Lee groomed herself to become an activist and advocate in Oakland and committed to standing up for the most vulnerable citizens in her community.
Lee traveled to Washington, D.C. to work for then U.S. Congressman Ron Dellums after receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mills College in Oakland in 1973. Lee later won a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) fellowship to attend the School of Social Welfare, and she earned a Master of Social Work from the University of California-Berkeley in 1975.
Lee later served in the California State Assembly and State Senate before she was elected to Congress in 1998.
After serving in the U.S. Congress for more than 25 years, Lee ran unsuccessfully for California’s U.S. Senate in the 2024 primary election.
Lee joins current Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed as Black women serving as chief executives of major cities in California over the last few years.

“I speak for our Oakland community and the families OEA serves in thanking Supt. Johnson-Trammell for her service. With public schools and immigrant families under attack nationally from Trump and with budget challenges affecting many California school districts, these are tough times demanding the best of what we all have to offer,” said OEA President Kampala Taiz-Rancifer in a statement released Thursday.

While pointing out that Supt. Kayla Johnson-Trammell has been planning to resign for a while, the Oakland Education Association (OEA) thanked her for years of service to the schools and called for community involvement in the search for a new superintendent.



“I speak for our Oakland community and the families OEA serves in thanking Supt. Johnson-Trammell for her service. With public schools and immigrant families under attack nationally from Trump and with budget challenges affecting many California school districts, these are tough times demanding the best of what we all have to offer,” said OEA President Kampala Taiz-Rancifer in a statement released Thursday.
“While we disagreed strongly on a number of issues,” said Taiz-Rancifer, “Dr. Johnson-Trammell is a daughter of Oakland and a product of our public schools. We thank her for her service and wish her the best moving forward.”
She said the schools’ community was aware that the superintendent had been planning to leave well before this week’s announcement.
“The superintendent has spoken publicly throughout the year about her planned departure. In August 2024, the previous school board approved a renewed contract raising her compensation to over $600,000 per year and allowing her to step back from daily responsibilities beginning in the 2025-2026 school year,” said Taiz-Rancifer.TrendingSupervisor Wilma Chan, City Of San Leandro Announce Free Flu Vaccination Clinic
She said the teachers’ union has been raising concerns about the need for stability and financial transparency in the district.  “For three of the last four years, the district projected major deficits, only to end with millions in reserve.” This year, she said, the district added $90 million to central office overhead expenses.
“Just last month, a majority of school board directors took action to cap expensive consultant costs and develop alternative budget proposals that align spending with community priorities to keep funding in classrooms,” she said.
Taiz-Rancifer said the union stands behind the leadership of Board President Jennifer Brouhard and Boardmembers Valarie Bachelor, Rachel Latta, and VanCedric Williams.
