Mariah The Scientist is giving fans a glimpse at Young Thug's initial thoughts about Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef. In a recent interview Billboard published, Thugger's girlfriend opened up about her conversations with the jailed rapper while he's currently on trial for the YSL RICO case in Georgia. Mariah said she played Young Thug several diss tracks from the glorified feud. She said he's cool with both sides and is a genuine lover of all music. "He thinks it’s interesting, for sure," Mariah said. "We were listening to some of the songs. Not all of them, because now I’ve gotten lost." 
Mariah The Scientist and Young Thug have been dating for at least two years. Since he was arrested and charged with numerous crimes with his YSL brethren, Mariah remained loyal and continues to support her man by vouching for his freedom and visiting him whenever she can. Recently the couple was at the center of a firestorm after video from their private phone call in jail leaked on the Internet. In the lengthy video, Thug and Mariah talk about their love for one another and dish about some jewelry Thugger bought her. The leaked video sparked plenty of outrage from artists like Meek Mill and Drake, who believed the leak was a violation of their privacy. Meanwhile, the Atlanta-based singer is currently on her "To Be Eaten Alive Tour" in support of her recent album. The 10-track LP dropped last year and features collaborations with Thugger and 21 Savage.
