Drake has been hit with a copyright violation claim from Universal Music Group for sharing portions of his recently released trove of unheard music on social media.
Drizzy’s recently-revealed burner Instagram account @plottttwistttttt took to Stories on Thursday (August 8) to share a screenshot of the violation issued by Instagram.
While the notification identified UMG as the plaintiff, it did not indicate which of his newly released songs caused the violation of the website’s copyright agreement.
Check out the screenshot below.
It was earlier this week that Drake shocked music fans around the world by unloading tons of old songs, videos and even concepts for his private plane decor.
Released via a website named 100gigs.org and advertised with a new Instagram page at the handle @plottttwistttttt, Drizzy unloaded the 100 gigs of files to the interwebs.

Among the treasure trove are three unreleased tracks – one titled “It’s Up” with Young Thug and 21 Savage, another named “Housekeeping Knows” with Latto and a third called “Blue Green Red.”
There is also behind the scenes footage from the studio, the making of the “Hotline Bling” video and more, as well as a 16-page “exterior concept pack” for his plane.

In a post to X, Latto expounded on the drop by sharing a video rapping her verse on the aforementioned collab, which was then shared on the Plot Twist Instagram account.
The track is produced by Gordo, who also shared the song on X, saying, “DRAKE – HOUSEKEEPING KNOWS PRODUCED BY MEEEEEEE!!!! HES BAAAAAAACKKKK!!!”

Now, it seems, Universal Music Group is claiming that Drake doesn’t have the right to release all of this music because he’s under contract with the label.
Also included in the dump was a video of Drake and producer Noah “40” Shebib anticipating JAY-Z submitting his feature for the Scorpion song “Talk Up” in crunch time.

In the clip, the 6 God strategically weighs his moves knowing that Jigga was performing with Beyoncé on their On the Run II Tour that evening and would have limited time to record.
“I’m only laying down for like two hours while Hov’s doing his show ’cause I don’t want him to hit me and be like, ‘Hey, what do you think of this?’ and I’m not there to respond,” Drizzy tells his team.

Predicting Hov’s post-show process, he adds: “He’s on stage now. Two hours from now, it’s four o’clock. He’s gonna get off stage, shower, probably have a drink and then set back up with Guru to write and [record]. So that process is gonna be two hours.”
