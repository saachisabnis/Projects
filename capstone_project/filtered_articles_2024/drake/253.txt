James Arden “Jimmy” Jenkins, 81, of Mauriceville, Texas, passed away on September 16, 2024, surrounded by family at his home. 



Funeral services will be held at 10:00 a.m., Friday, September 20, 2024, at First Baptist Church in Mauriceville. Officiating will be Reverend Kevin Brown. Burial will follow at Jett Cemetery in Orange.



Visitation will be from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., Thursday, September 19, 2024, at First Baptist Church in Mauriceville.



Born in Village Mills, Texas, on September 18, 1942, he was the son of Raymond Odis Jenkins and Lucille (McGraw) Jenkins.  Jimmy was a devoted member of First Baptist Church Mauriceville, where he served as a deacon.    After college, Jimmy had a long and fulfilling career as a Cable Repairman for Southwestern Bell/ATT, a job that allowed him to connect with many people in his community over the years. He and his wife, Sybil opened Mauriceville Feed & Grain along with many other businesses in his community.  His lifelong passion for restoring and trading tractors and farm equipment led him to travel the US to different tractor and equipment auctions along with Sybil and eventually to start his own business, J.A. Farm Equipment.   Among his many interests, Jimmy cherished the joyful pursuit of chasing his grandchildren across the United States to attend their rodeos, stock shows and sporting events. He was fondly known as “PaPaw,” a name that echoed the joy and warmth he brought to the lives of his grandchildren and many others.  His commitment to service also led him to become a founding member of the Mauriceville Crawfish Festival. His achievements were recognized when he was honored as Farmer of the Year in 2011, a reflection of his hard work and dedication to the agricultural community. Though he has transitioned from this life, the impact of Jimmy Jenkins will continue to resonate within the hearts of all who knew him. His legacy is one of his love for the Lord, familial devotion, community involvement, and a deep-rooted passion for life that will not be forgotten.
He is preceded in death by his parents, Raymond and Lucille Jenkins, and his beloved wife of 52 years, Sybil Kathleen Boles Jenkins.



He is survived by his son Chad Jenkins and his wife Windee, daughters Aimee Drake and her husband Clayton, and Cara Little and her husband Lance; grandchildren, Tanner Jenkins and his wife Landry, Tyler Jenkins, Trever Jenkins, Kinlee Drake, Chance Little, and Chloe Little; great granddaughters, Murphie & Lennyn Jenkins and sister, Edna “Sissie” Smith, along with numerous other loving family members and friends who will carry forward the memories of his generous spirit and unwavering love.



Serving as pallbearers will be Tanner Jenkins, Tyler Jenkins, Trever Jenkins, Chance Little, Clayton Drake and Lance Little. Honorary pallbearers are Judge Chad Jenkins and Guy Collins.
