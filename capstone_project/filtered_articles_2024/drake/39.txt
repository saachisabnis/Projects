“Drake will NOT be on Bfb Da Packman’s album tonight,” their post read. “His feature on “OLYMPIC SH*T TALKIN” has been seemingly removed. The song is already released in some regions without his verse.”
Check out the post below.
Drake has previously shown support for Bfb Da Packman’s work, as he did back in 2022.
The Flint, Michigan native, who’s best known for his humorous rhymes and conversational flow, was documenting his weight-loss journey on social media — and it appears the 6 God has been keeping tabs.

Drake — a keen gym rat himself — recently gave BfB Da Packman some extra workout motivation by gifting the 27-year-old rapper a pair of his coveted NOCTA Nike Air Force 1 sneakers.
In a vlog uploaded to his Lunch Crew YouTube channel back in December, Packman can be seen opening a package that was delivered to his apartment and losing his mind when he realizes it’s a surprise care package from Drizzy.

In addition to a fresh pair of his all-white kicks, the shoe box contained a note from Drake that read: “To Packman, I hope you enjoy the gift. More importantly, best of luck on your weight-loss journey. Keep it up, kid. — The Boy.”
“Bro, these came from Drake?!” Packman reacted before letting out a surprised laugh. “Bro! This shit came from Drake, n-gga! You feel me? Bitch, I’m lit! Fuck you talkin’ bout? I feel like Lil Yachty, no cap. Can’t no n-gga tell me shit!”

After holding back tears of joy, the Fat N-ggas Need Love Too rapper vowed to take his music career up a notch next year while reflecting on his long-running Drake fandom.
“2023, I’m going up!” he added. “Bitch, I got Drake’s support, you feel me? I’ve been fucking with Drake since two thousand — I don’t know when. As a little fat kid, I used to go in my basement and play ‘A Night Off’ by Drake, n-gga. This shit crazy, bro. I’m feeling like I made it! I’m about to go make my best songs this year, 2023.”
