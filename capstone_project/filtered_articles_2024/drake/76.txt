Dame Dash is set to lose his stake in Roc-A-Fella Records. This follows his failure to pay an $800,000 settlement from two years ago. Reports indicate that Dash’s 33 percent interest in the label will be sold at a public auction on August 29 in Manhattan.
To participate in the auction, bidders must register with lawyer Christopher Brown. The minimum bid starts at $1.2 million. Successful bidders must also make a deposit of $240,000 to finalize the purchase.
Key assets, including Jay-Z’s debut album “Reasonable Doubt,” are expected to be part of the auction. The full details are yet to be disclosed, but the sale marks a significant moment for Roc-A-Fella Records, co-founded by Jay-Z, Kareem Burke, and Dash in 1994.
The auction stems from a defamation and copyright infringement case Dash lost to filmmaker Josh Webber in 2022. Webber claimed Dash tried to pass off the 2019 film “Dear Frank” as his own. The court ordered Dash to pay $805,000 in total damages.
Webber alleged Dash was fired from the film for being inebriated on set but continued to pitch the movie under a different title. Following the verdict, Dash expressed his frustration on Instagram, saying, “You have to lose some battles to win a war… stay tuned #fatliars #youllneverbeme. Don’t ever say you Directed MY movie.”
Webber responded on Instagram, simply writing, “Case closed” while tagging Dash and adding the hashtag #dearfrankmovie.
The sale of Dash’s shares is a notable moment in hip-hop history. Roc-A-Fella Records, founded with Jay-Z and Burke, has been a major influence in the music industry. With Dash’s stake being auctioned, the future ownership of these shares could impact the label’s legacy.
Lupe Fiasco suggested Drake as a potential buyer, stating, “[Drake] will keep it safe for generations to come.” This statement reflects the high stakes and importance of the auction.
