The Ken & Friends concert is the culmination of a strong year for Mr. Duckworth, as he secured his second solo Hot 100 No. 1 with the Drake diss track “Not Like Us.” The song also reportedly pulled in a little over a quarter of a million dollars, validating its status as one of the few times rap beef actually paid off for a participant. 
Before that, Kendrick nabbed his third overall No. 1 with “Like That,” another song calling out Drake (I’m sensing a theme here), which appeared on Future and Metro Boomin’s joint album, We Don’t Trust You. So yeah, I’d say it’s been a good year all around for Kendrick Lamar, and now, he’s sharing the wealth with his hometown show.
