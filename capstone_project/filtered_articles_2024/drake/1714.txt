In a recent statement, Ross said no one "suffered any injuries" from the scuffle and "can't wait to go back"
A video of Rick Ross getting into a fight in Vancouver, Canada has gone viral amid his feud with Drake – and 50 Cent shared his thoughts on the altercation.
The assault reportedly took place after the ‘I’m A Boss’ star performed at the Ignite Music Festival on Sunday June 29.
Ross walked off stage while playing Kendrick Lamar‘s infamous Drake diss track, ‘Not Like Us’, and – in the viral brawl footage – you can see what’s thought to be Ross arguing with a member of the crowd. The man threw a punch at Ross, prompting a brawl between the attendees gathered around the two men.
In the video, some of Ross’ squad can be seen getting pushed around and falling to the ground. At one point, one of his affiliates was seemingly unconscious, suggesting he was knocked out during the scuffle.
Many believe that those who attacked Ross did so in support of Drake amid his feud with the Maybach Music Group founder.

The following Monday (July 1), Ross commented on his time at the festival. First, he shared a photo of him posing in front of a private jet on his Instagram Story, with the caption: “Vancouver it was fun, till next time”.
Then, in a statement to TMZ, the rapper said no one on his team “suffered any serious injuries” following the assault, adding “Vancouver is a beautiful city, and [I] can’t wait to go back.”
In an email to USA Today, a representative for Ross added that the rapper and his team “are all well” after the fight.
50 Cent has reacted to the footage from the Vancouver fight on his Instagram page. He said (per Complex): “I just saw a very unfortunate situation that took place in Canada. I wanted to say to everyone, you know, that I hope that that brother made it home safely.”
The New Yorker continued: “I hope that he now has a different perspective and a better sense of what to do and what not to do while you’re out in the world.
“That part where the young guy, he did this little move and shit and he got knocked the fuck out right there, that does not reflect him. That reflects his camp and he might need to go get the Dreamchasers or, um, the 305 Killers.”

In a now-removed tweet, 50 jokingly added, in part: “Nah pick up ya mans he over there laid out.”
Back in April, Drake released ‘Push Ups’ – his first diss track mostly aimed at Lamar – and took a jab at Ross. In response, the Florida rapper dropped ‘Champagne Moments’, where he accused the OVO founder of getting a nose job and sending a cease-and-desist to French Montana.
Ross continued to tease Drake online by calling him “White boy” and “BBL Drizzy” on Instagram. The latter later retailed on ‘Family Matters’ where he rapped: “What the fuck I heard Rick drop, n****?/ Talkin’ somethin’ ’bout a nose job, n****/ Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy/ And doctor never told y’all n****s.”
In other news, Camila Cabello has commented on the current Drake slander, saying it is “frustrating” because he is “‘such a delight”.
