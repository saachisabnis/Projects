Better relationships fuel the 2024 Atlanta Falcons. Natural pairings and refusing to force a square peg in a round hole are enthralling. 
Whether it be new head coach Raheem Morris and incumbent general manager Terry Fontenot’s vibrancy. Whether it be four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Kirk Cousins rejuvenating former Pro Bowl tight end Kyle Pitts, or All-Pro Justin Simmons & Falcons free agency Mount Rushmore safety Jessie Bates III, it must still be asked: Is the best wide receiver combination in the NFL Drake London and Darnell Mooney?

Leading WR Duos in the NFL: 
New York Jets (9 Games) - 1,075 yards, 10 touchdowns
Houston Texans (9 Games) - 1,063 yards, 6 Touchdowns
Atlanta Falcons (8 Games) - 1.025 yards, 9 touchdowns
Baltimore Ravens (8 Games)  - 949 yards, 4 touchdowns
The Texans' number is locked in: Stefon Diggs tore his ACL. The Davante Adams trade in New York means Lazard’s production is soon (now) slashed. Put my money on Atlanta’s “tandem bike”, as London calls it, to outlast Baltimore in that statistical category.
Let’s further project perspective with….projected numbers at the duo’s current rates alongside Cousins and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson.

QB Kirk Cousins:
Let’s also remember Cousins was coming off an injury and playing with a new team. In Cousins’s first-four games he averaged 216-yards passing and had four touchdowns. In the last-four games, Cousins is averaging 311-yards passing and has 10 touchdowns.
To be fair, the competition level kicked up a notch after the first-four games of the season, but there’s no doubt Atlanta passing attack has been more prolific as the season wears on.
WR Drake London
Drake London since Week 4: 🔻 49 Targets (2nd among WRs) 🔻 34 Receptions (3rd among WRs) 🔻 389 Receiving Yards (5th among WRs) 🔻 8 Contested Catchs (T-1st among WRs) 🔻 3 Touchdowns🔻 PPR WR2 pic.twitter.com/FGqPQkXrdo
WR Darnell Mooney
Darnell Mooney has been one of the most improved players to me. His route running has purpose and the Falcons are using his skillset correctly. Created lots of leverage vs. the coverage multiple times here. pic.twitter.com/oljHWd1Me0
"Both guys (London and Mooney)… are very smart football players, very unselfish, willing to do whatever it takes to win the game, and so that's always fun," Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said. 
Cowboys All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs did not practice Wednesday with a calf injury, nor did All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland with a foot. Bland was activated off injured reserve Wednesday. THE All-Pro on the defense, edge rusher Micah Parsons also did not practice Wednesday (high ankle sprain).
Let’s wrap up with some Cowboys quick hitters that support another projected big day from Mooney & London. 
The NFL’s best wide receiver duo currently costs AAV less than $20 Million a year COMBINED. Cee Dee Lamb’s average salary on his new contract? $34-million.
How ‘Bout Them Cowboys?
