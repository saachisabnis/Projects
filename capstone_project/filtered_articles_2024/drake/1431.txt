Ice Spice opens up about the time Drake “flew ” her out.
During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Spice talked her friendship with the 6 God. “We was on the jet like, ‘Wait, Drake’s flying us out? Like, gag. When we saw him, I was like, ‘Nah, this is crazy.’ He’s just casually there. There’s mad random people around, and he’s just, like, blending in somehow.”
The ‘Deli’ rapper does say she hopes to work musically with Drake in the future. She then speaks about their current friendship. “We talk, but we never really was on some bestie shit. He’s excited for Y2K!, he told me.”
When asked about the battle between Drake and Kendrick Lamar she says,  “I’m a music lover. So, I appreciate the sport of it — I think it’s really cool.”

Drake took a liking to Spice back in August 2022, with her breakout hit “Munch (Feelin’ U).”
She previously spoke about their first interaction together. “Linking up with him was so cool. Like, he’s mad nice and respectful. We went to OVO Fest. It was exciting because it was like his first time performing in Toronto, I think in like a couple of years. So it was just a movie, everybody was excited.”
Spice addressed her ongoing beef with rapper Latto. “I feel like if we ever spoke and I asked her ‘What’s the issue?’ it’d be like a blank stare. It’d really be no issue whatsoever. Especially from me,” Ice says.
“I can understand a friendly competition, but I just feel like at this point it’s a joke that she’s just dragged out, and it’s just not even funny. Like, bro.”
