Drake is not getting any love in his hometown of Toronto as the Canadian rap superstar was recently booed at a Limp Bizkit concert.
On Friday (July 26), a video surfaced of famed nu-metal legends Limp Bizkit performing at their concert in Toronto. During the band's set at Toronto's Budweiser Stage on Wednesday (July 24), the band's frontman Fred Durst causally revealed to the crowd that Drake was watching from the side of the stage.
"Did you know Drake’s here tonight?" Durst asked, which elicited a chorus of loud boos from the crowd. At one point in the video, which can be viewed below, one person can be heard saying, "What the f--k?"
Durst was stunned by the crowd's reaction.
"I thought Drake was your homie? What? No? Drake's my homie," he said before performing their next song "Take a Look Around," which he dedicated to the rapper.
