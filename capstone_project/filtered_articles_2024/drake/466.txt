Lil Yachty and Drake have been good friends for a long time, but fans believe a discrepancy over a song may have sparked a rift between both artists.It all began earlier this week when Akademiks told his followers that Drake plans to release the song "S.O.D (Super Soak)." The media personality also claimed Drizzy will drop a music video for the track and reportedly played a clip of the visuals during his live stream. According to Ak, the song will arrive with one major update â€” Lil Boat won't be on it. Fans believe the news upset Yachty enough to unfollow The Boy on Instagram. 
The alleged update shocked fans as well. Lil Yachty reportedly brought the song to Drake and intended to put it on the Concrete Boys' recent album. Their collaboration contains a sample of "Goodness Gracious" by Mr. HotSpot, who unfortunately prevented them from releasing it due to the explicit language in the song. Mr. HotSpot eventually told the duo they could use his song if they cleaned up their verses. Before the sample was cleared, Yachty decided to leak the song to streamer Kai Cenat. At first, Soulja Boy thought it was Drake's way of responding to his X rant about him, but he cleared things up with Drizzy and claimed it wasn't supposed to drop at all. Fans realized Yachty unfollowed Drake after news about the updated song went viral. It's not clear if he'll address the situation online. Yachty recently claimed he was done with social media after he confirmed Karrahbooo's departure from Concrete Boys. After fans called him out, Yachty returned to Instagram to re-follow Drake, and this time it was no accident. Check out the receipts below.
