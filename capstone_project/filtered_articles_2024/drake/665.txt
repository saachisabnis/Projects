Drake receives the wax figure treatment from Madame Tussauds once again, and fans are torn. The iconic wax museum debuted its reimaged concert floor earlier this week following a multimillion-dollar investment into its Times Square location in New York City. In celebration of the updated space, Madame Tussauds revealed its brand-new wax figure inspired by the Toronto native. Drizzy's wax figure wears a brown sherpa jacket over a grey t-shirt, black tie-dye jeans, and all-white Air Force 1's. The 6 God's wax figure also rocks the Boy's signature cornrows, his pricy 42-diamond necklace, a bracelet, and diamond earrings. 
“Our new music experience is one of those magical spaces within the museum that guests are immediately drawn to, so we’re confident the reimagined area, which is more immersive than ever, will bring a new level of excitement to the experience,” Eliza Rose, marketing manager at Madame Tussauds New York, told Billboard. “Plus, with so many A-list musicians surrounding you, who wouldn’t feel like a star here?”Drake's wax figure lives on the famed concert floor. The all-new theme keeps the spirit of New Year's Eve in New York City alive all year long. The room is illuminated by bright lights that resemble fireworks. It also has confetti-covered floors and a mock building with a countdown. Drizzy's wax figure throws up his infamous OVO hand sign next to other famous figures including Megan Thee Stallion, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, Beyoncé, Anitta, Harry Styles, Dua Lipa and more. This is the second time the wax museum has honored Drake with a life-like figure. The museum's London location debuted a Drake figure in 2019.
