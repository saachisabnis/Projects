With one preseason game to go here's our latest Patriots roster projection. Paul Perillo 
The Patriots will take on the Washington Commanders on Sunday Night Football to close out their 2024 preseason but there are still plenty of roster questions looming over the team with jobs to be won.
The linebacker, cornerback and offensive line groups are particularly hard to project, as the positions feature depth but untested quality.
With head coach Jerod Mayo saying that everyone healthy will play, save some valued veterans that are still working through camp bumps and bruises, it should be a good opportunity to get some more definitive answers how the 53-man roster will shake out.
In the meantime, here's our second projection with where things stand entering the final game.
Quarterback (3)
Jacoby Brissett, Drake Maye, Joe Milton
The only question here is what to do with Milton? The rookie is immensely talented but light years away from being able to operate an NFL offense. Mayo could try to squeeze him through to the practice squad, and likely would succeed, but he could opt to play it safe in order to continue Milton's development. Bailey Zappe never got a chance to truly compete and will likely be sent on his way.
Running back (4)
Rhamondre Stevenson, Antonio Gibson, Kevin Harris, JaMycal Hasty
This sets up in pairs of two with Stevenson and Harris the traditional ball carriers and Gibson and Hasty as the third-down types. Harris shows occasional power running between the tackles and should be given the opportunity to serve as the backup. Rookie Terrell Jennings has flashed at times in camp and has the ability to catch the ball as well, a skill that Harris struggles with.
Wide receiver (7)
DeMario Douglas, Tyquan Thornton, K.J. Osborn, Ja'Lynn Polk, Jalen Reagor, Kayshon Boutte, Javon Baker
PUP: Kendrick Bourne
Bourne still has yet to practice so the assumption is he'll start on PUP. That leaves an extra spot and Boutte has been productive enough to earn it. Seven is a big number but by October the number could be smaller, perhaps down to five. Thornton needs to stay healthy and provide an outside deep threat, as he has throughout camp. Polk looks like a solid possession type receiver, while fellow rookie Baker has been largely uneven all summer. Injuries generally help these decisions along.
Tight end (3)
Hunter Henry, Austin Hooper, Mitchell Wilcox
Injuries are part of the equation here as Henry has missed the last two weeks. Assuming he's ready to go to start the season, and Wilcox is as well, this trio makes sense. Rookie Jaheim Bell also missed some practice time to injury but flashed a bit upon his return. His versatility could earn him a spot over Wilcox but the practice squad to start might make sense.
Offensive line (9)
Vederian Lowe, Sidy Sow, David Andrews, Mike Onwenu, Chuks Okorafor, Caedan Wallace, Layden Robinson, Nick Leverett, Michael Jordan
The offensive line is obviously a work in progress. The two rookies, Wallace and Robinson, are pushing for playing time, especially with Lowe nursing an upper body injury and missing some practice time recently. Backup center is a minor concern as there have been a lot of issues with snaps throughout the summer. Leverett appears to be the lone center behind Andrews with the ability to handle those duties. Look for some additions after cuts.
Defensive line (5)
Davon Godchaux, Keion White, Deatrich Wise Jr., Daniel Ekuale, Jeremiah Pharms
The loss of Christian Barmore is enormous and the Patriots really have no one with anything close to his skill set. Pharms has enjoyed a solid camp while Ekuale has proven to be an effective interior sub rusher when healthy. White will get the opportunity to fill a larger role and his interior power could offer a lift. Veterans Armon Watts and Trysten Hill are run stuffers but neither has stood out this summer. One could stick around but based on how the reps were dealt out it wouldn't be surprising to see both go.
Linebacker (8)
Ja'Whaun Bentley, Jahlani Tavai, Anfernee Jennings, Joshua Uche, Raekwon McMillan, Oshane Ximines, Joe Giles-Harris
PUP: Sione Takitaki
The loss of Matthew Judon is every bit as damaging to this group as Barmore is for the defensive line. Jennings is solid setting the edge in the run game while Uche, when healthy, can get after the passer. Like Bourne, Takitaki hasn't practiced and seems destined to open on PUP. Christian Elliss and/or Joe Giles-Harris could earn a role here as well.
Cornerback (7)
Christian Gonzalez, Jonathan Jones, Marcus Jones, Marco Wilson, Shaun Wade, Isaiah Bolden, Alex Austin
Gonzalez and Jonathan Jones are the clear starters but after that there are questions. Marcus Jones appears to have the slot role but has battled injuries. The depth pieces all come with question marks. At times Wilson, Wade and Austin have shown flashes, and Bolden offers some versatility. But none has done it consistently. Rookie Marcellas Dial is worth keeping on the practice and has been competitive in coverage throughout the summer.
Safety (4)
Jabrill Peppers, Kyle Dugger, Jaylinn Hawkins, Joshuah Bledsoe
This is a versatile group with Peppers, Dugger and Hawkins all showing the ability to operate in the box and back in coverage. Marte Mapu hasn't practiced since Day 2 of camp and would appear ticketed to open the season on injured reserve. Rookie Dell Pettus has impressed at times and could take Bledsoe's spot but should stick around in some capacity regardless.
Specialists (4)
Kicker: Joey Slye
Punter: Bryce Baringer
Long snapper: Joe Cardona
Coverage: Brenden Schooler
Slye has been the better kicker and should win the job over second-year man Chad Ryland. Otherwise, these picks are all pretty straightforward.
