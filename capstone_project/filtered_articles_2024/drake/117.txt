“Lemme do a Drake face,” he said as he laughed while struggling to nail the look. “I”m just talking shit, man.”
You can view the funny clip below.
For his part, Drake himself has poked fun at the signature pout – though he says he doesn’t realize he’s doing it and even blamed Joe Budden for the influence.
Taking to Instagram on Wednesday (August 28), Drizzy posted yet another selfie showing off his signature pout along with the caption: “I’m not aware of my picture or mirror face it’s a curse from birth and I’m influenced by what I see.”

He also posted pictures of YouTube star Duke Dennis and a young Budden, seemingly crediting them for the widely-mocked selfie pose.
Dennis, who has almost three million YouTube subscribers and is best known for “hood vlogs” and NBA 2K-related content, reacted to the post by commenting: “Lmaooo [crying face emojis].”

Drake replied: “@dukedennis I accept my contributions to the mirror face members…we are akin to one another.”
Ice Spice and Soulja Boy also expressed their amusement at the post, while Lil Yachty poked fun at fellow rapper Ken Carson by writing: “u forgot to add ken carson in this line up.”

Drake and Joe Budden have a long and complicated history, with the two exchanging various shots over the years.
Meanwhile, Big Sean and Drizzy have always been amicable over the years and have collaborated multiple times in the past including on “All Me” and “Blessings.”

However, Sean did feel a way when Kanye West would praise frenemy Drake over him while he was signed to GOOD Music.
“Let me ask you, bro — if somebody owed you $500,000 how would you feel? And they were up a hundred million, how would you feel?” Sean asked N.O.R.E. in a 2021 Drink Champs interview. “What if they owed you three million? What if they owed you six? What if they owed you that and you showed up for them and doing all these things? And then the n-gga who talks the most shit about him, he bigging up in the interview and shit? I’m talking about Drake, who, you know, he loves. So when you talk ‘Loyal To A Fault’, not just the song but the mentality? It affected me personally, bro.”

Later he added, “It’s not all about the money. It’s the principle. I haven’t done a ‘7 AM On Bridle Path,’ I haven’t put it in nothing. I had an issue with all the respect being paid to somebody who publicly did that. And I know people be going through things, making up and that’s beautiful. I want to see my brothers together, but to me, I take that personal.”
Ye and Sean still appear to be at odds, with the the Detroit native seemingly dissing his former label boss in a freestyle just last month.
