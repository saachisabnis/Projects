Saturday night is alright for fighting. AEW Collision (Sep. 21, 2024) emanated from MassMutual Center in Springfield, MA. The show featured Dustin Rhodes & Sammy Guevara defending ROH gold in a Bunkhouse Brawl, Nigel McGuinness preaching the Fragile Countdown, and more.
The Sons of Texas
The opening contest was a wild and crazy time. Dustin Rhodes & Sammy Guevara defended the ROH World Tag Team Championship against the Kingdom in a Bunkhouse Brawl. The champs showed their new tag team name the Sons of Texas then arrived wearing local Massachusetts hockey jerseys. Nigel McGuinness rightfully ridiculed their pandering to the home crowd.
This brawl was a bloody affair with plenty of cool spots. Dustin hit a bulldog off stage on Matt Taven to crash through a barbed wire table.

Sammy hit a cutter out of nowhere on Mike Bennett off the apron through tables. When Sammy climbed a ladder, Taven tipped it over to send him smashing through a table. That led to a 2-on-1 sequence to rough up Dustin. The Natural did a double goozle on the Kingdom’s jewels, then he cleaned house with a cowbell. In the end, Sammy took out Taven with a GTH. Dustin wrapped barbed wire around his boot to deliver Shattered Dreams to Bennett’s groin. Sammy finished with a swanton off the ladder onto Bennett.

If you are a connoisseur of bunkhouse brawls, then this is a fun one to watch. There was a lot more physicality than I mentioned. The barbed wire Shattered Dreams was a fitting way to finish, since Bennett is a master of the wiener punch. The Kingdom were great in their roles for this match.

Sammy and Dustin were an unexpected duo when they first joined forces, but they have turned into a solid team. Their styles mesh well together with both adept at hot tag moments. Dustin’s presence helps Sammy get treated like a babyface from the crowd, because nobody will be booing the Natural at this point in his career. Sammy’s presence lightens the load for Dustin and gives him purpose to be on screen beyond the occasional spotlight. All in all, this tag team is a good use of both wrestlers.
Later backstage, Sammy wanted to have two title just like Dustin, so the Spanish God challenged Okada to an eliminator match for the AEW Continental Championship at Grand Slam. This promo shows exactly how strong the Sons of Texas’ partnership has blossomed with support for one another.

The Fragile Countdown
The show closed with Nigel McGuinness addressing his match against Bryan Danielson at Grand Slam. Nigel accused the American Coward of faking his injury, because he is afraid. Tony Schiavone interrupted to dispute Nigel’s garbage. Nigel responded with disgust and warned Schiavone to pipe down.
Nigel made his way to the ring. He urged Danielson to show up to New York to finish the final chapter in their rivalry. Nigel’s knows that he is as good as Danielson, but nobody believes him. This will be Nigel’s chance for the vindication that he deserves.
The Fragile Countdown was an okay promo spiel. I suppose Nigel’s speech was something that needed to happen at some point. I’ve heard the talking points through his social media videos, but I’m not sure how aware fans watching only on TV were of his logic. As a way to end the show, I thought the choice was a little flat. It was a lot of gabbing with no payoff in the moment. The dream rematch feels rushed for Grand Slam rather than unfolding organically.
Let’s jam through the rest of Collision.
Mark Briscoe, Kyle O’Reilly, & Hologram defeated Premier Athletes. In a pre-match promo, Briscoe pointed out Mark Sterling as a shenanigator (instigator of shenanigans). The word of the day was Azucar, because Rocky Romero was there to watch their back against Sterling’s cheating ways.

As Briscoe predicted, Sterling caused a distraction when Dat Boy climbed the corner for a froggy bow. Romero made the save, then Hologram tackled Sterling on a suicide dive. Briscoe finished Josh Woods with the Jay Driller.

Solid trios action. The Conglomeration is on a roll, and Hologram remains undefeated. I like how AEW used a backstage promo to set up the finish. The promo was a good example of adding interest to otherwise lukewarm matchmaking. Briscoe’s ‘word of the day’ should be a staple for these situations. His speaking style brings energy for viewers and O’Reilly to get excited for the upcoming match.
Mariah May defeated Lady Frost. AEW Women’s World Championship eliminator match. Mariah blew a kiss to Nigel on commentary, and it momentarily blew out the feed on TrillerTV. That must have been some kiss. Mariah handled business. She thwarted Frost’s rally for a headbutt, a knee strike, and a piledriver to win.
That's it. Nigel is done for the night.Watch #AEWCollision LIVE on TNT!@RealLadyFrost | @MariahMayx | @McGuinnessNigel pic.twitter.com/Dx7MioyUky
Mariah is racking up victories to legitimize her reign. I thought she was clearly presented on a higher level than Frost, and that’s not always the case in eliminator matches. It wasn’t an easy win, but Mariah was never in serious trouble.
Darby Allin defeated Evil Uno. Before the contest, Allin read the riot act to the Dark Order for people thinking that they are jokes. Allin refuses to lie down and die, and he wanted to see that same fighting spirit from Uno.
Darby Allin wants Evil Uno at his absolute best for their match later tonight!Watch #AEWCollision LIVE on TNT!@EvilUno | @YTAlexReynolds | @DarbyAllin | @LexyNair pic.twitter.com/7mpDaTJh4D
Uno took those words to heart and fought with aggression. He even whipped Allin with his belt. Allin matched that intensity to rally for victory. A suicide dive took down Alex Reynolds. A Coffin Drop on the outside and a Coffin Drop on the inside finished Uno.
Damn, that match was much more entertaining than I anticipated. The promo was a key ingredient to set the tone. Uno kicked Allin’s ass at the start. If this was the first time watching AEW, viewers might think Uno is the bigger star. That’s how much ass he kicked. Allin shined in victory by withstanding the beating to overcome the odds.
Serena Deeb defeated Queen Aminata. The Professor stretched her opponent. Aminata rallied with force. Deeb showed her veteran savvy in the end. Both wrestlers were on the outside. Deeb re-entered first. When Aminata followed, Deeb pounced for a dragon screw legwhip in the ropes. That move did enough damage for Deeb to execute her Detox finisher.
Queen Aminata gave it her all, but would fall to @SerenaDeeb #AEWCollision is LIVE on TNT pic.twitter.com/ipWA5CSOEg
Another match that delivered better than expected. Aminata was throwing bombs. Deeb showcased her technique. The blend of skills worked well together for nice chemistry as opponents.
Deeb’s attention now turns to Dr. Britt Baker DMD. AEW announced that Baker returns for the 5th anniversary of Dynamite on October 2. Deeb called out the dentist to be her opponent on that show.

Roderick Strong, The Beast Mortos, Rush, & Grizzled Young Veterans defeated FTR, Outrunners, & Hook. The most electric moment in the ten-man contest was Turbo Floyd running wild with body slams on a hot tag. He shared a muscular handshake with Truth Magnum for a teamwork standing elbow drop.

The Outrunners even hit a Shatter Machine on James Drake. Mortos made the save, and the match erupted into chaos leading to the finish. Mortos saved Rush from a Shatter Machine by FTR. The bulls were on parade to pull out the shocking win. Rush pinned Dax Harwood on the Bull’s Horns dropkick.
Wow. I did not see that result coming, especially with FTR taking the loss. That was a nice monkey wrench in the predictable to create the unpredictable. It felt like a big deal. AEW must follow up with FTR versus Rush & Mortos, because that’s now a match viewers will want to see. As for the action, the bout had an exciting pace with plenty of cool moves and sequences.
Notes: The MxM Collection will reveal the makeover of Max Caster’s jacket at Grand Slam. It is their magnum opus. Thus, the reveal can’t come so soon. That would be premature.

The Acclaimed responded to the himbos by claiming they had weak fashion. I’d say that’s just a lie. MxM are clearly fashion icons for the Tip Touchers.

Willow Nightingale spoke about being inspired by Yuka Sakazaki. Deonna Purrazzo interrupted to criticize Willow being a bad friend. Purrazzo offered protection to Yuka prior to the world title bout versus Mariah May at Grand Slam. Willow sassed back, so Taya Valkyrie stepped up in her face. Willow versus Taya was agreed for Rampage next week.

Saraya had Harley Cameron explain the Saraya’s Rules rules for her match against Jamie Hayter at Grand Slam. The rules were one-sided in Saraya’s favor, such as no outside interference unless from a friend of Saraya. Harley ate the paper with the rules on them.

Stud of the Show: Evil Uno
Damn. Where has that version of Evil Uno been? The masked man was a menace, and I want more of that attitude from him.
Match of the Night: Sons of Texas vs. Kingdom
The action was fitting for a Bunkhouse Brawl with equal parts badassery and cheekiness.
Grade: B-
This episode maintained the story momentum from last week. The flow was more cohesive than usual on Saturday nights due to promos setting the mood for the matches.
