Quarterback Michael Penix Jr., whose selection by the Atlanta Falcons at No. 8 in the first round of the NFL draft Thursday stunned many draft experts, smiled through most of his introductory news conference Friday in Atlanta.
"A dream came true," the former University of Washington star said. "It's a dream I've had since I was a little kid. ... It's a special moment and something I will forever remember."
Penix's excitement far overshadowed any concern over his position in the draft.
"I'm here to do whatever I can to help this team win football games," he said. "As far as what anybody else feels about the decision that was made, I have no control over that. All I can control is what I do and what I bring to this team.
"For me I know that I'm gonna be a great leader not just on, but off the field as well. I'm gonna be a great person and great teammate as well."
As amicable as he seemed Friday, it was clear Penix has no shortage of confidence.
"Personally, I feel like I'm the best quarterback out of the draft," he said. "I'm excited that I landed here and I'm excited to get started."
He was repeatedly asked whether he had any problem with the Falcons' succession plan, with Penix sitting behind No. 1 quarterback Kirk Cousins.
"I'm going to put in a ton of work," he said. "There's not going to be a beat missed. ... You got to be ready. I'm gonna prepare, I'm gonna work just as (if) I'm the starter."
The Falcons recently signed Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract, and the veteran QB was "confused" about the selection but reached out to Penix.
"Kirk he's an amazing guy," Penix said, adding that Cousins contacted him after the pick was made but wouldn't divulge details of their conversation.
"I'm gonna keep it between me and him right now but it was definitely a good conversation, and I'm super excited to work with him -- and he said he's the same with me."
Penix, the fourth quarterback drafted Thursday night out of a record-tying six first-round QB picks, led the Huskies to last season's national championship game where they were beaten by the Michigan Wolverines.
Michigan's quarterback, JJ McCarthy, was selected 10th by the Minnesota Vikings and Oregon's Bo Nix went 12th to the Denver Broncos.
The draft's first three picks were quarterbacks: USC's Caleb Williams (to the Bears), LSU's Jayden Daniels (Commanders) and North Carolina's Drake Maye (Patriots).
Penix was asked about comparisons with another Falcons left-handed signal-caller, Michael Vick, and said Vick was his favorite quarterback growing up.
"He did great things here, obviously," Penix said. "I keep in contact with him. He's been a guy that I can reach out to whenever. He actually sent me a text congratulating me this morning."
Penix said a recent visit to Seattle by the Atlanta coaches to see him throw apparently cemented their belief.
"It's different whenever you see it up close, in person," he said. "I feel like I did a very good job in the workout. ...
"I feel like the offense is very good for me. ... I felt very comfortable and confident with all of it."
