Kanye West aka Ye has decided to join the rap battle scene with a diss track of his own. 
The Chicago rapper decided to jump on a modified version of the Kendrick Lamar featured Future and Metro Boomin track ‘Like Dat’ which his own verse. 
Debuted on Justin LaBoy’s The Download, Ye raps, “It’s a wrap for nas, Where’s Lucian, serve your master, na, You caught a little bag for your masters didn’t ya, Lifetime deal I feel bad for n*****,” seemingly going after Drake. 
Kanye West also decided to diss J. Cole in some lyrics from the track, “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind, I can’t even think of a Drake line, Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry.”
Cole had previous taken shots at Ye in the 2016 track, “False Prophets.”
“When he tell us he a genius but it’s clearer lately, It’s been hard for him to look into the mirror lately, There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe, That’s the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take,’Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he the type of nigga swear he real but all around is fake. The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men, Nobody with the balls to say something to contest him, So it grows out of control, Until the person that he truly was all along is starting to show.”
Take a look at the track below.
