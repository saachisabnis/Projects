According to reports, BlocBoy JB has made it clear that his loyalty lies with Drake, especially amid the ongoing tension with Kendrick Lamar. In a recent Instagram Story, BlocBoy took aim at rappers who, once close to Drake, have since distanced themselves. The rapper shared, “I’ll Never Switch Sides ON Anybody That Helped Me This Rap Game Different N***as Will Fake Fucc Wit Ya For Da Moment Just Cuz It’s Beneficial I’ll Never Switch UP On Da [Owl] Ion Give Af Wat Cuh Do.”
BlocBoy JB’s loyalty to Drake is deeply tied to their 2018 collaboration on “Look Alive.” Reflecting on the experience in an interview that same year, BlocBoy shared the story behind how the track came to be, offering insight into the roots of their musical connection. 
BlocBoy stated, “OK, so, he had posted the song [on Instagram], and as soon as he posted it, I had replied 100.” “And then he was like, ‘My favorite rapper! We gotta cook.’ As soon as I said, ‘OK,’ he called me. And then the next day, he sent me his part of the song.” 
He further explained, “He knew my producer [Tay Keith] already so he was already talking to him and he got the beat from him, sent it to me early in the morning.” “I jumped straight up and went to the studio. Then about two or three days later, he was in the city and we shot the video. It still seem fake, like a dream. I could pinch myself and not feel it.”
Several months later, Tay Keith, the producer behind the track, shared that Drake had originally handed the song to BlocBoy, expressing gratitude for his involvement. 
In a recent conversation with Billboard, Keith expressed, “I had cooked up Drake a pack and that ended up being one of the beats he fucked with.” “Then, we eventually sent it to BlocBoy JB and let him hop on it. We shot the video the same week. We really did everything quick. It was a real Memphis vibe. That’s what we gave y’all. When you’re doing big things, you could bring the city out. The whole idea was from Drake. He did us a favor by giving us the song. Drake’s the G.O.A.T.”
