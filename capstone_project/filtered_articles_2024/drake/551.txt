DEFUNIAK SPRINGS, Fla. (WMBB) — A new walking path in Walton County is aimed to connect families with recreation.
County Commissioners and Mossy Head School children helped cut the ribbon to open the Mossy Head Park walking path Wednesday morning. 
The path spans approximately 875 feet in length and is 8 feet wide. The trail connects the sidewalk adjacent to Mossy Head School Road to the county park just off Highway 90.

District 3 commissioner Brad Drake said a local resident spawned the path idea, something he says is needed for overall community health.
“I think that’s probably one of the largest drivers of health care costs right now is inactivity, lack of recreational opportunities and exercise,” said Drake. “So we want this for all of our residents, especially our kids, to be an opportunity to be able to have as many exercise opportunities that we can make available.”
Recent improvements to the area included a redesigned path alignment, now featuring a crushed concrete surface. 
Additionally, 2,500 square feet of sod has been installed to stabilize any of the disturbed areas.
