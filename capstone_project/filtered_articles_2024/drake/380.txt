Asked about why she wouldn’t say who her child’s father is, Red replied: “Cause I don’t need anyone in my business — like why you want to be so nosy? Mind your fucking business.”
The rapper recently gave birth to her second child. During her pregnancy, she came close to revealing the identity of her partner after the two posed together for a maternity photoshoot, but his face was blurred out in the images posted online.

Sexyy Red toured with Drake while pregnant but managed to keep the news private.
She later detailed how she managed to keep it to herself: “When nobody knew I was pregnant, I’d be in the back room like tryna suck my stomach in or wear clothes to show that I wasn’t pregnant.

“And I had to practice my breathing — like before I’d go on stage, I had to hold my stomach in and look at myself and be like, ‘Can they tell?’ Once I just was like, ‘Okay I can’t keep hiding it ’cause it hurt to just be on stage all day holding your stomach in.’ So I’m like, ‘Just forget about it.’”
She continued: “I was pregnant on the Drake tour and the Moneybagg tour but nobody knew. People started suspecting it on the Drake tour because there was videos and pictures of me coming out. That’s the only reason I was hiding it because I just wanted me and my family and friends to know.”
