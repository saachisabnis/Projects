Snoop Dogg says he apologized to Kendrick Lamar for reposting Drake's AI-generated diss track during the height of their beef. On Tuesday, December 17, Bootleg Kev released his in-depth interview with Tha Doggfather. At one point during their conversation, Kev asked Snoop how he felt about Kendrick Lamar's lyrics about him on "wacced out murals." The Missionary rapper wasn't fazed by the line "Snoop posted 'Taylor Made,' I prayed it was the edibles/I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go." In fact, he admitted it really was the edibles. 
"He feels that I shouldn't have played that," Snoop explained. "Damn I was on them edibles my n***a I gotta be more careful, you right nephew." Drake's "Taylor Made Freestyle" features AI-generated verses from the late Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Soon after the song dropped in April, the Death Row Records owner appeared to co-sign the track after he posted a clip of it to his Instagram Story. The song also appeared in a collaborative post he did with someone, which also appeared on his Instagram account. During the interview, Snoop said he didn't hear the song in both videos before he reposted them. "When I do it, I don't listen to the music," Uncle Snoop said. "I just see 'Gin & Juice' 'cause it's my brand. So when I post it, I'm thinking I'm posting 'Gin & Juice.' I don't know what song it is. I'm not hip to everybody's music. Then I get the word that 'Nephew didn't like what you did. What did I do? You played some music. What music? I had to go look at the â€” I'm like oh that's cuz.' So I deleted it, called nephew, left him a message because he ain't pick up he was working on his s**t. I left him a message like 'Nephew this Uncle Snoop. I got the message. I apologize. I was f**ked up." It looks like Snoop and Kendrick are back on good terms. Watch Bootleg Kev's entire interview with Snoop Dogg below.
