NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Gloria Drake has lived in Nashville her whole life and said she is always out walking in the Edgefield area.
She says as times have shifted, she’s kept her walking to the daylight hours. While she wasn’t in the South 5th and Russell Street area Monday night, she was shocked to hear what happened.
“I’m surprised and I’m bothered,” Drake said. “This area is a good area.”
Metro Nashville police say they found 59-year-old James Sutton lying in the intersection around 8 p.m. Monday. Sutton had head trauma and multiple broken ribs, which is why police originally thought it was a hit-and-run incident.
Sutton later died at an area hospital.
“Why would someone want to have that kind of heart,” Rodney Corley said. “It’s bad...it’s sad, very very sad.”
After combing through area surveillance, police say they saw someone physically assaulting Sutton. That’s why detectives have now pivoted their investigation.
“I’ll be apprehensive when I’m coming this way because people are different,” Corley said.
Friends of Sutton tell us he was a war veteran, serving as a tank commander during his time in the service. He also spent time at Community Care Fellowship which is a local ministry.
While police search for the victim, people like Corley say the community needs to rally together to find the person or people responsible.
“When you see people acting like that it’s cause they’re hurting,” Corley added. “Hurt people hurt people.”
MNPD has not released any suspect(s) or surveillance of the incident.
