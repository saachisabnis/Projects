AMARILLO'S #1 HIT MUSIC STATION
An hour after Drake dropped his diss track "Family Matters," Kendrick Lamar delivered a nuclear response with the ferocious diss track "Meet the Grahams."
The song was in response to Drizzy's "Family Matters," on which he blasted the Compton rapper's family and his pgLang partner and former Top Dawg Entertainment president Dave Free.
On the six-minute-long "Meet the Grahams" diss, produced by The Alchemist, Pulitzer Kenny aimed his lyrical shots directly at Drake, dissecting the Toronto rap star and his terrible vices, including alcohol, gambling and drugs.
"You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems/Pill-poppin' and spendin’ problems, bad with money, whorehouse/Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start," he raps on the song.
Kendrick also accused Drake of being a deadbeat dad and alleged that he has another child, a daughter, in addition to his son Adonis, that he's purportedly keeping a secret. Drake would later deny Kenny's accusation.
"You lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh/You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come," K-Dot viciously rhymed on the track.
Kendrick also dragged Drake's mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham, and his father, Dennis Graham into his surgically-precise diss revealing who their son has become.
"Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator/Even usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor," K-Dot spewed in his verse, adding, "I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions/Psychopath intuition, the man who like to play victim/You raised a horrible f**kin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis."
Even more brutal, Kenny rapped to Drizzy's mother that he thinks immoral people, who he deemed her son is, should die.
"Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen/Mhm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts/I think n***as like him should die," he viciously rapped in the verse.
Kendrick Lamar didn't hold back when psychoanalyzing Drake. Peep the most brutal lyrics  from "Meet the Grahams" below.
