Their bank accounts must be unlimited
The long-awaited Wicked film has more celebrities than songs in it. Even the really minor roles went to A-list stars. The main Wicked cast has about $360 million (£290 million) between them – and that’s not all Ariana Grande!
Because we’re extremely nosy individuals, here is the main Wicked cast ranked by how ridiculously massive their net worths are. These figures come from Celebrity Net Worth.

The actor isn’t quite as rich as Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (yet). He apparently got a big pay rise after the first season of Bridgerton was so successful. The man needs to start a Regencycore luxury drinks brand or something, because at the moment he’s apparently got one of the lower net worths of the Wicked cast.
Maybe he has a great personality?(Image via Universal Pictures)
Ethan Slater’s main acting credential until Wicked was the lead role of SpongeBob SquarePants in The SpongeBob Musical: Live on Stage! Oh, and a single episode of Law 7 Order: Special Victims Unit back in 2018. Yet, the internet thinks he’s got $3 million in the bank? Somebody make it make sense.
Cynthia Erivo looking very green(Image via Universal Pictures)
Wicked is easily Cynthia Erivo’s most eye-catching role yet. But she’s been a successful actress for a while. Her big break was starring in the Broadway show The Color Purple from 2015 to 2017. She portrayed Harriet Tubman in the 2019 film Harriet, and Aretha Franklin in the 2021 show Genius: Aretha. Cynthia Erivo also had small roles in the live-action version of Pinocchio and the dystopian film Chaos Walking. She does also have one solo album out called  Ch. 1 Vs. 1.

Spoiler alert! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth were the original Elphaba and Glinda in the Broadway musical, whose recordings of Defying Gravity and Popular you probably screamed along to in the car when you were 12. They have a big surprise cameo in the Wicked movie. Idina and Kristin act as the actresses in the musical Wizomania within the movie (you following?), while Elphaba and Glinda sing One Short Day.
Idina Menzel definitely isn’t short of cash. Sing Let It Go, and you never have to work again. She was a successful Broadway performer long before she started landing film roles, but I’m guessing most of her money came from Arendelle.

You’re forgiven if you totally forgot that Peter Dinklage is part of the Wicked cast. The man voices a show tune-singing history-teaching goat. Although, “singing” might be a bit of a generous term for what he does during his musical number Something Bad.
“Rich as a Lannister” is a saying in the Game of Thrones world, but it totally applies to Peter Dinklage too. By the end of the show, HBO was paying him $1.2 million (£957,000) for each episode he played Tyrion Lannister in.
Michelle Yeoh slaying as always(Image via Universal Pictures)
The queen that is Michelle Yeoh has been scoring high-paying acting roles since the 1980s. Her breakout role was as a Bond girl in Tomorrow Never Dies. She’s starred in very deep and meaningful films like Memoirs of a Geisha and Everything Everywhere All At Once, but also quite a few less deep and meaningful films such as the Marvel movie Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.
Last year, she married Jean Todt, who’s been the boss of various motor racing organisations. He’s worth about $18 million (£15 million).
Well of course Jeff Goldblum is the Wizard of Oz(Image via Universal Pictures)
I’m really not surprised that Jeff Goldblum is absolutely loaded, to be honest. He’s been landing roles in expensive blockbusters for 40 years.
However, the 71-year-old said on the Table for Two podcast that he’s not going to leave much money to his eight-year-old and six-year-old sons. He wants them to make their own way in life without relying on him.
Maybe she’s planning more perfumes while she’s filming?(Image via Universal Pictures)
It’s not much of a surprise that the biggest star also has the biggest bank account. Ariana Grande legit has a bigger net worth than all the other Wicked cast members put together. As well as bashing out several albums over the last decade, she’s been cashing in on her fame by starting r.e.m. beauty and by churning out another perfume virtually every week.
I’m sure the Wicked movies will be very healthy for her bank balance. Universal Pictures has been really raking it in with the brand deals – you can legit buy Glinda-themed Crocs.
