The scent has a rating of 4.7 out of five stars on the Amazon website.
One shopper said: "I liked the good discount and that my niece absolutely adored it for her christmas present - the bottle was really pretty with the big fluffy pompom and the fragrance itself was much nicer than I'd expected - not as sickly sweet as I imagined it would be. Lovely gift for a teenager."
Another added: "Really nice sweet smell just like the body mist but stronger and will last all day. I would 100% [recommend]."
A third buyer said: "One of my favourite perfumes smells amazing and last[s] all day."
Although one shopper who wasn't a fan added: "Not for me, I was really disappointed as I love sweet perfumes. My body mist from superdrug smells better and lasts longer."
