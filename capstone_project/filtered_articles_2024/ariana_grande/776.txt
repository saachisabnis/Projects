Hollywood isn’t just about making movies anymore—it’s about creating what I’m calling Super-Brand Movies. These films aren’t just stories; they’re immersive, over-the-top ecosystems that infiltrate every corner of culture, from fashion and merchandise to social media trends and experiential marketing.
Take the new film adaptation of Wicked, produced by Universal Pictures. Starring pop icon Ariana Grande as Glinda, the good witch, and British powerhouse Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, the wicked witch, Wicked exemplifies this transformation. Grande’s global fame and Erivo’s critically acclaimed talent bring star power that extends far beyond the screen, anchoring a movie fans can engage with, wear, and even live in.
These Super-Brand Movies go well beyond storytelling. With Wicked introducing initiatives like "Shiz University"—the magical school where both witches meet—and Barbie sparking the viral "Barbiecore" movement, which embraces Barbie’s signature hot pink hues, Hollywood is diving headfirst into unrestrained branding. Films are no longer standalone narratives; they’re fully realized cultural ecosystems. Who knows? Maybe one day we’ll even see an Oscar category dedicated to these brand juggernauts.
For now, Wicked and Barbie stand as bold examples of the unashamed marketing I explore in my book, The Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells and How to Do It Right. And you all know that I’m here for it.
When Barbie launched in 2023, it set a new bar for over-the-top movie marketing. Margot Robbie’s Barbie-inspired press tour outfits, paired with collaborations with brands like Airbnb, Zara, and Bloomingdale’s, turned the movie into a full-blown cultural phenomenon. Fans didn’t just watch Barbie—they lived it. The rest of us couldn’t escape it.

Now, Wicked is taking its shot. With Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba—two unlikely friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz—Universal Pictures is applying its most ambitious and unapologetic marketing strategies yet. Over 60 brand collaborations, Wicked-themed Starbucks drinks, immersive fan experiences, and even Amazon Alexa integrations make one thing clear: Wicked isn’t just a movie—it’s a movement—or Universal Pictures best attempt at one anyways.
Wicked is doing something unique: it’s connecting emotionally not just by telling a story, but first and foremost, by building a brand. Most movies engage audiences emotionally through their narratives alone. Wicked, however, flips the script by taking a brand-centric approach—creating emotional resonance through its ecosystem of immersive experiences, merchandise, and cultural touchpoints, rather than relying solely on the film itself.
The emotional foundation is, of course, the source material. Adapted from Gregory Maguire’s novel and infused with emotional depth by Winnie Holzman, the Wicked musical version and stage musical has captivated audiences for decades. Themes of identity, otherness, and self-acceptance have made it a timeless and relatable tale. The film version builds on this legacy, with Idina Menzel, the original emerald-green skinned Elphaba, calling it “loving and respectful” while expanding on the original in “beautiful ways.”

But what sets Wicked apart is Universal Pictures’ decision to treat the movie as part of a larger brand experience. This isn’t just about crafting an emotionally moving film musical—it’s about extending the emotional connection beyond the screen. Initiatives like "Shiz University" invite fans to step into the world of Oz, while collaborations and merchandise tie the brand to everyday life. Instead of limiting the emotional impact to the story, Wicked allows audiences to live the brand, creating deeper, more personal connections. This strategy reflects a shift in Hollywood, where films are no longer standalone stories but immersive cultural ecosystems.
I’ve spoken at length about the importance of brands creating strong emotional connections with audiences. Deloitte's study underscores the importance of emotionally resonant storytelling in building customer loyalty. Their findings indicate that emotional connections are vital to customer loyalty and lifetime value. In brand relationships, as in personal ones, the foundation of emotional connection is trust, and the foundation of trust is consistency. Achieving this allows brands to deepen their connections, gain forgiveness when mistakes occur, and build stronger loyalty with each customer.
The Wicked film musical leans unapologetically into Hollywood’s brand-first philosophy, harnessing the global appeal of its entire cast. While the musical celebrates its 20th anniversary and its 7,486th Broadway performance—surpassing Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats—the movie production reinvents itself for modern audiences.
Rather than reprise the Broadway cast, including Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, executive producers Winnie Holzman, Jared LeBoff, Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, and Dana Fox opted for global icons. Ariana Grande’s cultural ubiquity and pop-star image infuse Glinda with contemporary glamour, while Cynthia Erivo’s emotionally charged performances lend Elphaba gravitas and intensity.
An expanded and diverse cast, featuring Bowen Yang, Peter Dinklage, and Danna Paola, modernizes the story and ensures it reflects today’s global audience. Winnie Holzman’s nuanced storytelling ensures that while the medium and cast have evolved, the heart of Wicked—its themes of identity, friendship, and extraordinary adventures—remains intact.

Wicked isn’t just about fan engagement—it’s about creating a brand-centric world. Platforms like "Shiz University," where Glinda and Elphaba first meet, transform the movie into a fully realized universe. By offering courses inspired by ethical commentary on topics like domestic violence, leadership, and personal identity, Wicked invites fans to connect in meaningful and purposeful ways.
Layering this with Winnie Holzman’s narrative craftsmanship, Wicked becomes more than a story—it’s a world audiences can inhabit. No different to Apple’s ecosystem of products or Virgin Atlantic’s commitment to making every interaction memorable, Wicked builds a space where audiences don’t just watch—they belong.
The strategy is a clever one and backed by research. According to Event Marketer’s EventTrack report, 98% of consumers said participating in an event or experience made them more likely to purchase if they were already interested in the product or service. Furthermore, PwC’s Experience is Everything report found that 63% of consumers are more willing to share their data with a brand they truly value—proving that immersive experiences not only deepen connections but also strengthen loyalty.

Over-the-top marketing used to be a gamble, but Barbie and Wicked prove that bold strategies can pay off big. Super-Brand Movies show that in an increasingly fragmented and cluttered landscape relevance can be achieved with extravagance.
Barbie nailed cultural resonance with "Barbiecore," blending nostalgia and female empowerment to dominate fashion, media, and lifestyle. What sets Wicked apart is how it tackles themes of identity, otherness, and acceptance. Elphaba’s emerald-green skin, symbolizing her outsider status, feels more powerful than ever in a world grappling with societal divides. Inspired by Frank L. Baum’s work, Wicked leverages timeless ideas that connect emotionally, while Universal Pictures builds an experience far beyond the movie.

Winnie Holzman, who adapted Gregory Maguire’s novel for Broadway, ensures that Wicked resonates deeply. The film celebrates its legacy, with a nod to the original cast and the Wicked 15th Anniversary Special, where Ariana Grande performed "The Wizard and I."
Much like Nike’s “Dream Crazy” campaign, reportedly inspired by The Kim Kardashian Principle, Wicked connects with cultural conversations, but in an immersive, unapologetic way, showing that cultural relevance can be bold and transformative.

Nostalgia Meets Modernity
Barbie seamlessly bridges the past with the present, reimagining the iconic doll with themes of empowerment and self-discovery that resonate with both long-time fans and newer audiences. This dual-layered approach allows it to strike a nostalgic chord while also staying relevant in today’s cultural conversations. Nielsen research shows that ads that elicited high levels of emotion performed twice as well as those with low emotional content when it came to driving sales, proving that this balance broadens a brand’s appeal without alienating core audiences.
Strategic Focus
Every element of Barbie’s campaign, from Margot Robbie’s “Barbiecore” fashion tour to collaborations with Airbnb, Zara, and Bloomingdale’s, ties directly to the film’s themes of individuality and self-expression. This coherence makes each aspect of the campaign feel intentional, amplifying its impact. A McKinsey study found that brands with focused strategies are more than twice as likely to report growth at least 10 percent above market rate, emphasizing the power of strategic alignment in successful campaigns.
Cultural Resonance
Barbie’s ability to embed itself into the zeitgeist is perhaps its greatest achievement. The “Barbiecore” aesthetic didn’t just dominate fashion—it sparked broader discussions about femininity, identity, and societal expectations. This cultural resonance has given the film a life beyond the screen, keeping it in public conversations long after its release. Edelman’s Trust Barometer reveals that consumers are more likely to buy brands that commit to taking actions like improving access to healthcare (7 times more likely vs. less likely), addressing climate change (5 times more likely), and ending racism (4.5 times more likely), proving just how much this matters in today’s landscape.
Tapping into societal themes and crafting multi-layered campaigns can make a story unforgettable—and impossible to ignore.

Build a World, Not Just a Product
Today’s consumers crave more than a product; they want immersive experiences. The Wicked musical version, inspired by L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, shows how creating a connected brand world invites audiences to immerse themselves deeply, forging emotional connections beyond the story itself. According to PwC, 73% of consumers cite customer experience as a critical factor in their purchasing decisions, with immersive, human-centered approaches driving stronger loyalty.
Amplify Scale with Story
In marketing, bigger can sometimes be better; as long as you’re amplifying emotional connection. Many of you know that I emphasizing importance of building brands that connect with audiences on an emotional level. That in my mind is the ultimate value of a brand creating emotional connections with consumers that transcend, rational ways of thinking. Deloitte reports that 60% of long-term customers use emotional language to describe their connection to fave brands, highlighting the power of authenticity and relatability. The Wicked film musical, featuring a cast led by superstar Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, builds on this with its emotional storytelling, balancing its roots with modern appeal. (Deloitte Insights)
Create Cultural Currency
To have long-term impact, brands need to embed themselves into the cultural zeitgeist. I’ve said it before, and I said I’ll say it again strong brands imbue themselves with an enormous amount of cultural currency, so the brand can start spontaneously emerging within the culture. McKinsey discusses how brands that excel in community engagement generate a fast-spinning flywheel, leading to increased conversation, engagement, and sales. And how shoppers are increasingly voting with their wallets based on a new set of concerns, including purpose, which drives their decisions.
Barbie’s "Barbiecore" aesthetic proves that tying a brand to societal conversations can dominate fashion, lifestyle, and media, ensuring relevance and resonance. Wicked, featuring an entire cast celebrating diversity and inclusion, taps into this by connecting with today’s broader societal themes. Marissa Bode makes history as the first actor portraying Nessarose in Wicked who uses a wheelchair in real life, bringing valuable representation to the big screen.

Pair Nostalgia with Innovation
Nostalgia is powerful, but it’s most effective when paired with bold innovation. Wicked exemplifies this by building on L. Frank Baum’s original work while introducing fresh concepts like the immersive "Shiz University." A study by YouGov and the7stars found that 90% of British consumers think fondly about the past at least occasionally, with 47% doing so almost always or quite often. This widespread sentiment underscores the potential of nostalgia in marketing strategies. I’d say nostalgia works best when reimagined with a forward-thinking approach.
Focus on an OTT Strategy
A clear, focused strategy outperforms campaigns that try to do too much. When every element of a campaign aligns with core themes, it creates a unified message that resonates deeply with audiences. According to a recent A Bain & Company survey of 650 senior marketing executives in the U.S. reveals that companies leveraging a strategic and effective approach to launching products, features, or campaigns see annual revenue growth rates up to twice as high—1.5 to 2 times—compared to those without a focused strategy. The Wicked film musical, drawing on its legacy and contributions from co-stars Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, ensures that its campaign reflects the brand’s core themes, resonating with both long-time fans and new audiences.
Prioritize Cultural Relevance
Younger audiences, especially Gen Z and Millennials, expect brands to stand for values that matter. A 2020 Consumer Culture Report by 5W Public Relations found that 83% of Millennials want companies to align with their values, and 76% expect CEOs to speak out on issues they care about. Additionally, Edelman's Trust Barometer indicates that 68% of consumers prefer brands that engage meaningfully with cultural moments, underscoring the importance of value alignment in today's market.
There is no doubt in my mind that the Wicked film musical, inspired by Frank Baum’s universe, and Barbie are transforming Hollywood as Super-Brand Movies. And Super-Brand Movies are attempting to reshape how audiences connect with entertainment.
Wicked builds on its rich theatrical roots while reinventing itself as a brand through and original cast and initiatives like "Shiz University," inviting fans to step into the world of Oz. Meanwhile, Barbie sparked the viral "Barbiecore" movement, blending nostalgia and cultural commentary to dominate trends across fashion, media, and lifestyle.
The film adaptation of Wicked exemplifies this evolution. Inspired by Frank L. Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the movie explores themes of identity, otherness, and acceptance, layered with extraordinary adventures and emotional depth. Its ethical commentary remains central, delving into what it means to belong and how society views those who are different—universal ideas that resonate deeply today. Elphaba’s emerald-green skin, symbolizing her outsider status, anchors this cultural relevance, making Wicked more than just a movie.

Set to premiere during the holiday season on November 22, 2024, Wicked boasts a star-studded cast, including Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, alongside Bowen Yang, Aaron Teoh, Danna Paola, and Joel Grey, the original Wizard on Broadway. Winnie Holzman, who first adapted Gregory Maguire’s novel for Broadway, returns with Dana Fox to craft the screenplay, preserving the story’s timeless emotional core. Principal photography, supported by Sky Studios, bridges Wicked’s theatrical legacy with cinematic grandeur, while cinematographer Alice Brooks (In the Heights) brings the vibrant world of Oz to life.
The journey doesn’t stop with Wicked. Wicked 2, set to premiere next year, could push Super-Brand Movies to new heights. And while we don’t know when the Wicked part two release date is quite just yet, could this sequel embody Super-Brand Squared, doubling down on the power of branding, cultural relevance, and ethical commentary and its marketing strategy and beyond? In the words of Wicked itself: “Are people born wicked, or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?” In the era of Super-Brand Movies, I think we all know the answer to that now.
