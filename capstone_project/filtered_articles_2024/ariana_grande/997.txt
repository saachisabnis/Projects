As the “Glicked” double feature continues, Paul Mescal reaches across the aisle and gives a round of applause. The Oscar nominee praised Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande‘s performances in Wicked after the Jon M. Chu-helmed movie musical adaptation premiered the same day as his Ridley Scott sequel Gladiator II, following last year’s Barbenheimer box office event.
“I met Cynthia and Ariana at the Academy Gala very briefly, and I’ve seen the film,” he told Attitude. “I think they’re both extraordinary. And I’m a musical theater guy, I’m a big advocate for that film.”
Amid the Glicked craze, Mescal said, “Give it whatever title you want to give it. [Barbenheimer] was an amazing thing for cinema in general. If we can get people in the door for both films, not only is it great for us, it’s great for Wicked, but it’s great for the cinema industry in general. So, if you like cinema, support it.”
In Gladiator II, Mescal stars as Lucius, who previously witnessed Maximus (portrayed in the first film by Russell Crowe) die at the hands of his uncle Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) in the first movie. As an adult, Lucius is forced to enter the Colosseum and fight to restore glory to the people of Rome.
Based on the Broadway musical, Wicked follows the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Erivo), and Glinda, the Good Witch (Grande), as they first meet at Shiz University and share a life-changing encounter with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum).
Breaking multiple box office records, Wicked had a $164.2 million worldwide opening. Meanwhile, Gladiator II made $221 million after an overseas head start.
