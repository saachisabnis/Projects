NBC's Saturday Night Live has tapped Sydney Sweeney & musical guest Kacey Musgraves and Josh Brolin & musical guest Ariana Grande for March.
Well, it looks like we won't have to wait until stand-up comedian Shane Gillis and musical guest 21 Savage take the stages of NBC's Saturday Night Live this weekend to learn who else is on tap this season to serve as host, musical guest – or both. On March 2nd, we have Sydney Sweeney (Anyone But You) hosting, with musical guest Kacey Musgraves. Following that, on March 9th, we have Josh Brolin (Dune 2) hosting, with musical guest Ariana Grande.
