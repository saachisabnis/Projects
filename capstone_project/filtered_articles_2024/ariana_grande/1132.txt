Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions: Pop Field
 With Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber all potentially dropping albums this year, BPSP already seems packed. I see “Agora Hills” getting in before “Cruel Summer” ever does. It would just be a nomination that’s taking up a worthy slot because it’s from 2019, it would be very unfair to give it a nomination when the Lover album already got it’s moment and accolades. 
I disagree. Lover didn’t get any recognition in 2020, all it had was a few nominations but 0 wins, which is understandable based on the other nominees. Truth Hurts managed to win BPSP after 3 years because it became a hit in 2019 so I think Taylor should be at least nominated for bringing back that amazing pop song to the charts. Quality-wise, it’s definitely a strong contender.
Taylor you better submit Reputation TV vault tracks for Grammy submission
I think she’s done submitting Taylor’s Versions. Her job was done when Red got her her much deserved Grammy. 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Are the lover accolades in the room with us rn?? Because that album literally got snubbed to death at the grammys.
Dua’s new era is an absolute non-starter, she’s not winning anything.

Not sure about that. She probably has a goal of getting all of her first 6 albums a Grammy. reputation will most certainly have something submitted even if it’s just to Best Music Video.

📈 | “Houdini” surpasses  “Physical” & “Break My Heart” as  @DUALIPA’s 6th song with the most top 10’s on Official Charts worldwide, with 25!
1. “Don’t Start Now” — 452. “Cold Heart” — 433. “One Kiss” — 394. “New Rules” — 364. “Dance The Night” — 366. “Houdini” — 257.… pic.twitter.com/3547GosLpW

US is just tasteless as always
I might be wrong, but I think Nicki Minaj & Lil Uzi Vert’s “Everybody” could end up in Pop Duo/Group instead of Rap Perf./Melodic Rap Perf.

The Grammys are an American awards show.
Also any metric where Houdini is ahead of Levitating is a worthless metric so…

No, Levitating was a very US hit (surprisingly)
Taylor will only submit Taylor’s Versions if she doesn’t have a new album out. It’s that simple.

well no…it was a hit everywhere. it has nearly 3 billion streams on spotify alone, that’s definitely not a “very US” hit
Is “Houdini” even going to be submitted? I think Dua made it very clear that it was a promo single and “Training Season” is the official lead single of her album, I’m presuming. 
I hope Ariana pushes a new song soon because “yes, and?” wasn’t it and I can barely see this song getting nominated in pop, let alone the general field.

it was promoted at radio, it’s an official single and it is the lead single. that doesn’t mean they’re going to push it the most

the only way it misses a nomination is if they don’t submit it or the pop dance recording category is removed. it is getting into that category very easily

Well, there’s virtually zero competition right now so that’s a given but depending on how her next single goes, I can see her team pulling a split in the pop vs GF like they’ve done in the past.
