After an impressive theater run, fans of The Substance were hopeful Demi Moore would earn nominations for her career-best performance in the film. Since the horror genre does not get as much attention from award shows, it felt like a long shot since the movie is a body horror satire. However, the film has continued to gain popularity and earned five Golden Globe nominations.  With the addition of the Critics Choice nominations, the film is carving a path to the Oscars.
The 30th Critics Choice Awards film nominations were announced and The Substance earned 7 nominations including Best Picture, Best Director (Coralie Fargeat), Best Original Screenplay (Fargeat), Best Actress (Demi Moore), Best Supporting Actress (Margaret Qualley), Best Hair and Makeup, and Best Visual Effects.
The film has some tough competition in their nominated categories. Dune: Part Two, Emilia Pérez, A Complete Unknown, Anora, The Brutalist, Nickel Boys, Conclave, Wicked, and Sing Sing are competing for Best Picture. While Moore competes with Cynthia Erivo (Wicked), Karla Sofía Gascón (Emilia Pérez), Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Hard Truths), Angelina Jolie (Maria), and Mikey Madison (Anora) in the Best Actress category. And for Best Director, Fargeat is up against Jacques Audiard (Emilia Pérez), Sean Baker (Anora), Edward Berger (Conclave), Brady Corbet (The Brutalist), Jon M. Chu (Wicked), RaMell Ross (Nickel Boys), and Denis Villeneuve (Dune: Part Two).
Margaret Qualley has also been recognized for her supporting role in the film. She is nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. She faces off against Danielle Deadwyler (The Piano Lesson), Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor (Nickel Boys), Ariana Grande (Wicked), Isabella Rossellini (Conclave), and Zoe Saldaña (Emilia Pérez) for the Critics Choice award.
The Substance has had a remarkable box office run that has resulted in $56.5 million globally on a 17.5 million budget. Initially, the film won Best Screenplay at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. Then, Mubi purchased the film for $12 million and it has become the biggest hit on the streaming platform.
The Substance currently sits at 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, with major critics citing Moore’s performance early on as an Oscar contender. Now, with the film earning nominations in other major categories, it gives it a better chance for nominations at Academy Awards.
