Frankie Grande is setting the record straight about his sister, Ariana Grande.
The YouTuber, 41, couldn't contain his laughter when it came to the latest rumor, which is that his beloved sister is a cannibal. "HAHAHAHAHAHA. Wow! This might be the most creative and lowest y'all have ever gone," Frankie wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Thursday, July 11.
"Reaching new depths daily! Listen, I know my sister's been eating the girls up for years but this is a bit extreme! Besides, she's vegan. 🌱 See you on tour! 🌈," Grande continued.
His response was shared along with a repost of a Buzzing Pop post with a couple images documenting the trend, along with the caption, "Fan's joke about Ariana Grande being a cannibal has gone viral in an effort to deter people away from buying concert tickets."
One of the images in the Buzzing Pop post featured a video of the Wicked star, with overlay text that read, "Police found evidence of human remains and cannibalism in the home Ariana Grande sold in Chicago in 2013." Another image showed that when you search "Ariana" on TikTok, the second suggestion to come up is "Ariana cannibalism."
The wild accusations began as a joke among fans who were hoping to get their hands on tickets to Ariana's concerts. A recent internet trend has fans "posting outlandish allegations" against their favorite artists in the hopes that it will deter others from buying tickets to their shows, allowing them to score the coveted tickets, per Billboard. Of course, the tour for Ariana's chart-topping album Eternal Sunshine has not even officially been announced as of yet.

The accusations against Ariana may have been a joke, but they did arise not long after the Grammy winner received flack for saying she found Jeffrey Dahmer "pretty fascinating." On an episode of the Podcrushed podcast shared on June 17, 2024, Ariana recalled a memorable fan experience from earlier on in her career.
She was speaking with a younger group of fans, and one of them asked, "If you could have dinner with anyone living or dead, who would it be?" After asking the parents if she could respond honestly, Ariana said, "They were like, 'Sure, what's the answer?' and I was like, 'I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer is pretty fascinating.'"
On the podcast she added, "I think I would have loved to have met him. You know, maybe with a third party or someone involved. But I have questions."
