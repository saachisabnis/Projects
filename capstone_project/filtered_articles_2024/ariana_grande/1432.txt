Unlimited…your future is…unlimited. At least that’s how Amazon Prime members should be feeling today as they’ve recently been offered an exclusive deal to be some of the first to see this year’s highly anticipated adaptation of the hit Broadway musical “Wicked.” 
While the film is set to release on Friday, November 22, Amazon Prime members can now purchase tickets for early screenings on Monday, November 18 at multiple theaters throughout the country. The deal is conducted in partnership with Fandango, where tickets will have to be purchased after logging into your Amazon Prime account. There doesn’t seem to be any limit on how many tickets can be purchased, but it is on a first come/first serve basis and will only be valid now until November 18.

A film adaptation of “Wicked” has ostensibly been in development since it first premiered on Broadway in 2003 starring Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth, Joel Grey, and Norbert Leo Butz. Marc Platt, who served as a producer on the musical, has led the effort, having produced many films musicals including “La La Land,” “Mary Poppins Returns,” and “The Little Mermaid.” Jon M. Chu was brought in to direct the project in 2021, taking over for British filmmaker Stephen Daldry who left as a result of scheduling conflicts. Chu, who is coming off a film adaptation of Lin Manuel-Miranda’s “In the Heights,” went on to cast pop singer Ariana Grande as Galinda, later Glinda the Good Witch of the North, and Broadway star Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, later the Wicked Witch of the West.
Rather than release “Wicked” as one film, Chu chose to split it into two parts, ending the first half around where Act 1 of the show concludes. The film has been screened for select audiences already and is being met with high praise, particularly for Grande and Erivo’s performances, as well as the level of spectacle on display. After seeing the film for herself, IndieWire’s own Erin Strecker posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, “Happy to confirm ‘Wicked’ is the best musical-to-movie adaptation since ‘Chicago’ and ‘Mamma Mia.’ Ariana Grande….is perfection!?”
In addition to their Amazon deal, “Wicked” has a plethora of product partners including Target, Betty Crocker, Bloomingdale’s, Ulta Beauty, Starbucks, and many more.
