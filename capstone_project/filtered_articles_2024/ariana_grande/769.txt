Ariana Grande teased a preview of her upcoming music video for “The Boy Is Mine” on Instagram.
The mysterious clip features an actor dunking his face into an ice-filled sink while a claw-like hand lurks in the background.
Director Christian Breslauer, who worked on Grande’s previous visuals, hinted at an exciting release with “ACT III… soon.” Grande posted two Instagram photographs a week ago that followers believed were from a music video set.
The photographs show her wearing a cat-ear headband and having “TRUE LOVE” and “BE MINE” hearts on her wall next to a painted depiction of a man from his bottom lip to his shoulders. The pictures had no captions.
“Meow,” Grande captioned the clip, which reveals that the video for “The Boy Is Mine” will be unveiled on Friday, June 7.
