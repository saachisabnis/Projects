Ariana Grande has been an it girl since the very start of her career. She’s constantly blowing us away with the best beauty looks, so we’ve formed a habit of tuning into her Instagram for all of the stunning hair and makeup inspo. Lately, she’s been turning heads both on and off the red carpet because of her chic hairstyles. So unsurprisingly, her latest IG post solidified our obsession with the nostalgic side bang trend.
Ari knows how to rock a hair trend. After the internet became rightfully obsessed with her iconic take on the curly prom updo, it truly feels like she’s in her best hair era yet. And ever since she went blonde for her role as Glinda in Wicked, she’s been effortlessly pulling off so many cutesy coquette-inspired hairstyles. Thankfully her high pony phase is in the past, because these days she rarely sticks with a single look for too long.

Yesterday, Ariana debuted her brand new side bangs on Instagram. The side-swept baby bangs were worn with her hair pulled back and a comfy sweatshirt. Even on her most casual days, Ari is still showing up with the trendiest hair. And even though most of Gen Z has sworn off side parts, Ari’s icon status might just be enough to change their minds. At the very least, we can acknowledge that side bangs are making their long overdue comeback.
You read that right, side bangs are back. The MySpace era trend was once huge in the mid-2000s, and like most things from that era—they’re slowly making their way back into the trend cycle. Stars like Dua Lipa and Sabrina Carpenter have dabbled with side bangs, and they’ve proven how stylish they can be. Listen up Gen Z—the side-swept look is seriously worth experimenting with, especially if you trust Ariana Grande‘s judgment as much as we do.
