Ariana Grande recently opened up about the challenges of a vegan lifestyle during her appearance on the YouTube series “Hot Ones.” The Grammy-winning artist shared that her vegan diet often clashes with her Sicilian-American family’s cooking. Despite host Sean Evans enjoying vegan wings alongside her, Grande revealed that her family, especially her grandmother, sometimes forgets her dietary preferences. “My nonna always offers me meatballs, and I’m like ‘No, thank you, I’m still plant-based,’” she said.Grande also mentioned that her brother Frankie’s husband, Hale Leon, who is also vegan, provides some Support in navigating family meals. “I’m not alone, my brother-in-law Hale is vegan, so we have each other,” Grande noted.The episode, titled “Ariana Grande Hits a High Note While Eating Spicy Wings,” showcased Grande’s reactions to a series of increasingly spicy hot wings. Despite her initial nerves and preparations of bananas, Tums, and popsicles, Grande handled the heat surprisingly well. She admitted to having a mixed experience with the hot sauces, describing one as “disgusting” and noting that she might not be a fan of hot sauce in general.Latest Petitions to Sign:
