While not a trained vocalist, Yeoh expressed that she "loves singing. But normally it's in the shower, not when there's other people around."
To prepare for the role, Yeoh worked diligently with a vocal coach, stretching her vocal range. "I was hitting notes that I never thought that I would try," she shared. Her initial apprehension stemmed from concerns about her singing skills, which led her to worry about the possibility of being replaced. "I went in thinking this is going to be so scary â€” they're going to recast me when they hear me. But I am having so much fun!" she told 'Variety.'

In the behind-the-scenes discussion with 'PEOPLE,' director Jon M. Chu was aware of her nerves and insecurity. He remarked, "I could see a little fear in her eyes, for sure."
However, with the support of Chu and co-star Cynthia Erivo, Yeoh gained confidence. "Most of my singing parts are with Cynthia. She said, 'Just sing it out, girl. I can hear you singing. Just come out with it.' So they made me comfortable," Yeoh recalled.
The 'Wicked' set has also been a place of kindness and camaraderie. Newcomer Marissa Bode, who plays Nessa, shared with the outlet that she really appreciated Erivo's thoughtfulness. She remembered that the Broadway star brought homemade cookies to set, including vegan and gluten-free options. "So sweet that she's thoughtful," Bode remarked.
