Good news has finally arrived in the form of a broom, a witch, and I believe a house? Tony award winner Cynthia Erivo shared on Instagram that the two-part movie adaptation of Wicked finally wrapped production. 
The photo that went with the news, shows Erivo in costume as her character Elphaba, in mid-flight. This news comes, after some setbacks for filming but everything is in order for a December 2024 movie premier. Wicked is the prequel to the beloved musical The Wizard of Oz. The film focuses on Elphaba known as the (Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (Good Witch) whose friendship, rivalry, and romance clash for a legendary and unforgettable tale. The film is directed by John M. Chu and the additional cast include Ariana Grande, Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.
The film was not originally intended to be a two part movie, but director Chu stated “ We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one ‘Wicked’ movie but two!” That means that we will be getting another movie that is aiming to premiere in December 2025.
