Republic Records, Grande's label, also shared the news on Instagram, writing that it is "so excited" for her follow-up to "Positions."
In response, Grande left a series of emojis on the post, potentially hinting at the upcoming song's lyrics with mending, red and anatomical heart emojis.
The singer first teased that a new album was on the way on Dec. 7 by sharing glimpses of her in a recording studio.
Grande also posted muted clips of her singing and collaborating with songwriters and producers.
Grande's Sunday announcement comes days after her outing with her beau, Ethan Slater, in New York City made headlines.
The pair were joined by her father, Ed Butera, for dinner at the Grande family's "favorite Italian restaurant," an unnamed insider told Page Six.

Reports that the "Wicked" co-stars were dating surfaced in July 2023.At the time, Grande was separated from her now ex-husband Dalton Gomez, while Slater had filed for divorce from his now ex-wife, Lilly Jay.The singer filed for divorce from Gomez in September last year.Last week, Grande reflected on a "transformative" year and addressed misunderstandings and "assumptions" in an Instagram Story."I have never felt more pride of joy or live while simultaneously feeling so deeply misunderstood by people who don't know me, who piece whispers together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of my life," Grande wrote.Despite feeling deeply misunderstood, Grande expressed gratitude for the support and understanding from friends, family and fans and said she would only be "reacting to things" deserving of her energy moving forward.
