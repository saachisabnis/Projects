Kourtney Kardashian served up some serious sass when a fan compared her to her 11-year-old niece, North West.
The Keeping Up With The Kardashians alum stirred up some Halloween fun online by flaunting a chic black dress and giving fans a teaser for the spooky season.
Fans showered her look with praise, with one calling her “so pretty.”

“Words can’t describe how beautiful you are!” one said, while another gave her the title of the “Queen of Halloween”
“I can’t believe you’re in your 40s,” said another.
But it wasn’t just her outfit that caught people’s attention. A keen-eyed follower couldn’t help but comment, “Why does she look like North West???” referencing the 45-year-old’s niece and the eldest daughter of Kim Kardashian and ex-hubby Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian Barker (@kourtneykardash)
Kourtney’s to-the-point response was a classic mix of humor and family pride.
“We may be related,” she drily said.
The family pride truly runs in the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Case in point: another Instagram post that Kourtney recently shared of herself lounging with a drink in her hand.

“Don’t ever say I’m not ikonik,” she wrote in the caption.
The post triggered a response from her sister, Khloé Kardashian, who wrote: “Does everyone know what Ikonik means? Like is this a universal thing.”
That’s when Kris Jenner, the family matriarch, chimed in with, “Yes, Khloe it’s universal.”

STOP with these people already!!!
Just don't let the kid perform a musical ever again.
Hey, she's just a kid. If she wants to sing she should take classes and learn, but she doesn't needs to be mocked by fully grown adults on the internet !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJtgDho8Zjg
Enough said.
I know, but this is still not an excuse to make fun of her. She's a kid, not a professional adult singer.
I'm not making fun. I'm stating facts and providing proof of the job she did. The kid doesn't need to perform in a musical ever again.
So you're saying that she should drop it even if she likes it ? No one is good at anything without practice. I used to sing like a dying cat when I was a kid, and I made a fool of myself on stage once. Did I let that stop me ? Nope, I took classes and years after I was accepted to a very selective Opera class and now I sing very well.
Put yourself in contact with North West and her parents and not me then.
