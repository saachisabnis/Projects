A Wicked Stocking Filler: The PR machine behind the Wicked film licensing have line up partnerships ... More across sectors from fashion, beauty and tech
As Wicked hits the big screen on November 22, 2024, brands across industries are preparing to leverage the film’s cultural impact with targeted, strategic collaborations just in time for the lucrative Christmas season.
With Christmas 2024 expected to be a major shopping season, brands are positioning themselves to take advantage of the Wicked release, which aligns perfectly with the start of holiday retail. The film’s November 22 release date in the U.S. provides the ideal runway for retailers to stock shelves with Wicked products and take full advantage of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and pre-Christmas shopping surges.

With a vast licensing network, Wicked is poised to be a major commercial force, following a playbook similar to the success of the Barbie movie earlier this year. The film’s appeal spans across generations and fan bases, from lovers of the original Broadway musical to a new generation of moviegoers attracted by stars like Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.
Unlike other dual-character stories that focus on the dichotomy of good vs. evil, Wicked weaves together a more nuanced relationship between its two main characters, Elphaba and Glinda. Rather than positioning them as opposites, the story creates a magical fusion that highlights the complexities of their characters. This central narrative allows brands to tap into both personalities without relying on a simplistic good/bad duality. Much like Frozen, where the distinct personalities of Elsa and Anna spurred a massive merchandising engine, Wicked presents a wide scope of possibilities for brand partnerships that cater to diverse consumer tastes.
One of the most significant categories for Wicked’s brand collaborations lies in fashion. High-profile designers and brands like Zac Posen, Aldo and Swarovski have joined forces to launch Wicked-inspired collections that will hit shelves just before the holiday season. Additionally Ariana Grande has been officially announced as Swarovski’s newest Brand Ambassador.
Zac Posen‘s elegant designs will channel the glamour of Glinda’s lighthearted, whimsical aesthetic, while Aldo shoes will likely play with the iconic green and pink color schemes associated with the film’s two lead characters.
Rebecca Minkoff and Cambridge Satchel Company are also creating bags and accessories that embody the story’s themes. These fashion collaborations give consumers the opportunity to integrate elements of Wicked into their wardrobes in a way that feels both on-trend and reflective of the film’s essence.
By tapping into these contrasting characters, brands can offer product ranges that appeal to both sides of the consumer personality spectrum, from bold, powerful pieces to more understated, ethereal styles. Fashion brands will thus aim to reach a broader audience during the holiday season, presenting Wicked-themed items as stylish, must-have accessories.
The largest category of licenses for Wicked lies in toys and collectibles, with heavyweights Mattel and LEGO leading the way. Mattel will likely launch doll sets that celebrate both Elphaba and Glinda, while LEGO is expected to release themed sets that allow consumers to build key scenes from the film. These products are set to dominate holiday wish lists, particularly for families with a shared love of the Wicked story.
In addition, collectibles brands like Funko and Build-A-Bear are primed to create limited-edition items that will cater to adult collectors and younger fans alike. By aligning with Wicked, these brands are tapping into a cross-generational audience that has a deep connection with the story, making these products prime gift options for the Christmas season.
Brands like LUSH and Beekman 1802 are leveraging the Wicked phenomenon in the beauty and wellness categories, with exclusive bath bombs, skincare and makeup tools inspired by the movie’s iconic characters. LUSH, known for its limited-edition themed collections, will probably use this opportunity to introduce pink and green-hued products that channel both the magical and the natural elements of the Wicked universe. These offerings allow fans to bring the film’s enchantment into their daily routines.
In the home goods space, brands such as Hunter Price and Maxwell & Williams are creating everything from Wicked-themed candles to kitchenware, ensuring that the movie’s impact extends beyond fashion and toys and into consumers’ everyday living spaces. This broad licensing strategy underscores the commercial scope of Wicked, making it one of the most expansive film tie-ins for the 2024 holiday season.
Major retailers like Target and Walmart have already secured licences to carry Wicked-branded merchandise across multiple categories. From fashion collaborations to toys and collectibles, these retailers are preparing for the influx of consumers eager to engage with the film beyond the theater. In particular, Primark and H&M are expected to roll out affordable Wicked apparel for the younger demographic, making the film’s merchandise accessible to a wider audience.
The marketing strategy for Wicked echoes the successful approach seen with Barbie earlier this year. Margot Robbie’s campaign of appearing in Barbie-inspired looks on red carpets set a high standard for brand partnerships and Wicked is following suit. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo have been donning Wicked-inspired couture at major events like Cannes and fashion weeks, ensuring that the film remains at the forefront of cultural conversations leading into the holiday season.

This strategic PR campaign, coupled with a strong focus on symbolic colors, Glinda’s pink and Elphaba’s green, allows brands to lean into the visual identity of the film. Expect to see these colors dominate retail windows, packaging, and marketing campaigns in the months leading up to Christmas.
The buzz surrounding Wicked isn’t going to stop after Christmas 2024. With part two of the film already announced for release in 2025, brands are gearing up for a multi-year licensing strategy that will keep the Wicked magic alive. As long as the film hits with audiences, this momentum is poised to drive sustained consumer interest and keep Wicked products on shelves for seasons to come.
With a strategic release date, a broad spectrum of brand partnerships and a cultural moment ripe for capturing, Wicked is poised to become more than just a box-office hit. It has all the elements to dominate the commercial landscape of Christmas 2024, from high-end fashion collaborations to mass-market toys and beauty products. By aligning themselves with the film, brands are tapping into the magic that Wicked represents, ensuring that the story’s enchanting appeal will be reflected not just on screen, but in consumers’ everyday lives.
This fusion of film and commerce creates a win-win scenario for both Wicked and its brand partners, making the movie one of the most anticipated commercial tie-ins of the holiday season. Whether it’s a Zac Posen gown or a LEGO set under the Christmas tree, Wicked will make its mark on every part of the holiday marketplace in 2024. And with part two already confirmed for 2025, the Wicked phenomenon shows no signs of slowing down.
