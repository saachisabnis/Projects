Wicked is officially one of the biggest movies of the year, shattering records and dazzling audiences everywhere. With Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, this two-part movie musical has brought the magic of the Broadway classic to the big screen in epic fashion.
The first part of Wicked hit theaters on November 22, and fans are already counting down to the second installment, which will premiere on November 21, 2025. Based on the Tony Award-winning musical—and Gregory Maguire’s novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West — this retelling of the Land of Oz takes us deep into the lives of Elphaba and Glinda long before Dorothy dropped in.
For Ariana, landing the role of Glinda was nothing short of destiny. Back in 2011, she tweeted, “Loved seeing Wicked again… amazing production! Made me realize again how badly I want 2 play Glinda at some point in my life! #DreamRole.” Manifesting works, folks!
Ariana’s connection to Wicked runs deep. As a 10-year-old, she not only saw the original Broadway cast but even visited Kristin Chenoweth’s dressing room. “We got to Kristin’s dressing room, which was at the very end of the hall, and she invited me in and let me overstay my welcome,” she shared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “Her dog peed on the couch. We cleaned it up together.”
In true Glinda fashion, Kristin gifted young Ariana a wand and “magical shower gel,” which Ariana fondly recalls using “every single day, dipping a tiny little pinky in.” She now calls it “magical” for real.
Director Jon M. Chu knew this beloved story deserved room to breathe, which is why the adaptation was split into two parts. “With more space, we can tell the story of Wicked as it was meant to be told,” he explained.
Now, the question remains: Are you more of a headstrong Elphaba or a bubbly Glinda? Dive into our gallery and let the stars reveal your Wicked witchy side based on your zodiac sign! ✨
