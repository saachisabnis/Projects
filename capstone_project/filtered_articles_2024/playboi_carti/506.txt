Ahead of the release of the first volume of their long-awaited joint album, Ye and Ty Dolla $ign are at Chicago’s United Center tonight for a special Vultures, Volume 1 album listening experience.
Similar to his DONDA album listening experience, tonight’s event “offers a rare opportunity to experience Vultures, Volume 1 in an audio and visual showcase, marking a historic moment as fans everywhere will listen to the album for the first time together with the artists, album collaborators and special guests.” The event is also currently being livestreamed on Veeps.
The duo make their way on stage, with Ye sporting a hockey mask a la Jason Voorhees. They run through several tracks from the record, including “In the Stars” and “Paid.” Your bestie, Ms. North West(ie) joins the pair on the empty black stage for her feature on “Talking / Once Again,” followed by “Everybody,” the cut that features Charlie Wilson and samples the Backstreet Boys.

Next up is “Back To Me” with Freddie Gibbs and Quavo, with the former previously appearing at the Miami event, and “Hoodrat.” For “Do It,” YG appears for his guest feature on the cut, but Quavo is not present for “Paperwork.” Ye and Ty also preview “Burn,” which will appear on Vultures, Volume 2 next month. The Playboi Carti, Travis Scott and Quavo-assisted “Fuk Sumn” is played next without the guests, but Bump J is present for the title track. Freddie Gibbs didn’t appear when “Back To Me” played, but he does join the pair on stage later on.
