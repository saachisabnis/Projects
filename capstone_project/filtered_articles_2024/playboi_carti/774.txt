The Weeknd comes through with his highly-anticipated collaboration alongside Playboi Carti, and it's iHeartRadio's latest World Premiere. On Friday, September 27, Abel Tesfaye delivered his new single "Timeless" featuring the Opium founder. The bass-heavy track produced by Mike Dean, Pharrell Williams, Ojivolta and Twisco opens with Carti's melodic verse with Tesfaye's haunting vocals in the background. In his verse, Abel shouts out Skateboard P and The Neptunes. Tesfaye debuted the record during his critically acclaimed concert in Sao Paulo, Brazil earlier this month. The Grammy award-winning singer invited Carti to perform the track with him for the first time live. 
"Feel like Skateboard P, BBC boys on the creep/Feel like it's '03, Neptune drum with a beam," Abel spits.This is the second time Playboi Carti and The Weeknd have joined forces on wax. The singer-actor recruited the Atlanta native for his hit "Popular" with Madonna. Their song was a part of the soundtrack for his HBO series "The Idol." "Timeless" serves as the second single from Tesfaye's forthcoming album Hurry Up Tomorrow. His sixth studio album will mark the end of his ongoing trilogy following Dawn FM (2022) and After Hours (2020). He announced the title in a lengthy announcement ahead of his Sao Paulo show where he premiered the lead single "Dancing In The Flames." Tesfaye followed up with the explosive music video for the song, in which he walks away from a horrific car crash. He also performed "Dancing In The Flames" during his headlining set at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas. Look out for Hurry Up Tomorrow coming soon and listen to "Timeless" below.WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE
