His second collaborative effort with Ty Dolla $ign has been plagued by delays since missing its initial release date of March 8. Ye later announced that it would drop on May 3, but the album again failed to arrive with no explanation.
Despite this, Ty Dolla $ign has repeatedly insisted that Vultures 2 is still happening, saying during a livestream with controversial Russian YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy in May: “It’s dropping ASAP. Vultures 2 is on the way. It’s coming soon. Any day now.”

The ¥$ duo were also recently hit by a huge leak of tracks from various Vultures sessions, with dozens of songs surfacing online in near-finished states.
