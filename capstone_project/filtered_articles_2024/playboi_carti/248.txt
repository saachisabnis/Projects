For years, Playboi Carti has been teasing the new album I Am Music (also maybe called just Music). He’s shared a handful of new songs, too, and it looks like he’s now going to play the full album for fans at Rolling Loud Miami. The Opium rapper will take the stage at the Florida festival on Sunday, December 15. See the festival’s full lineup in the poster below.
Playboi Carti released his latest official solo single, “All Red,” in September. He’s since previewed more new music on Instagram. The rapper’s follow-up to Whole Lotta Red does not currently have a release date.
