Playboi Carti allegedly scammed Adin Ross when he promised him a full interview, according to the internet personality himself.
During a Kick stream on Sunday (March 3), the 23-year-old alleged that the Atlanta rapper lied to him when he promised him a full interview that he has apparently been paid for already — Ross thinks he did so in an effort to prevent beef.

“I don’t think Carti 2 is happening anymore,” Ross said. “I have a theory that Carti was just texting me to kind of just keep me in the position where I’m not gonna be on his bad side, where I’m on the internet talking crazy, if that makes sense — to get the heat off his name type shit.”
He continued: “I think I got played, but hey bro, it is what it is. Because I was texting his phone and he stopped answering out of nowhere. I have the warehouse footage.
“I’m about to just release it. I mean, once I get the confirmation that we’re not doing part two. Is that blackmail? I mean dude, I kind of got scammed, so I’m blackmailing a fucking scam so you can’t blame me.”
As previously reported, Adin Ross claimed that he was paid Playboi Carti $2 million and even gifted him a new Ferrari to appear on his stream just hours before their very brief interview early last month. The conversation lasted all of six minutes, and it ended soon after the rapper was handed a bag of money.
Days later, Ross shared photo of himself on FaceTime with Carti on Twitter, promising that all the questions people had would be answered soon.

“Stream soon. Part 2, the right way for the fans… all questions will be answered,” he wrote.
The amount Playboi Carti was actually paid is yet to be confirmed as Ross later told 21 Savage (who had also appeared on his stream not long before) that he “didn’t pay that” when questioned about the amount.
Soon after Carti’s cameo, the “a lot” hitmaker confronted Adin on a phone call and asked: “$2 million, bro?!”

Though Ross denied that was the full amount that Carti was paid, that didn’t stop 21 from continuing with: “Why the fuck you ain’t pay me, bro? That’s crazy, bro. I ain’t gonna lie, bro, that’s fucked up, bro.”
When he continued to deny paying King Vamp said amount, 21 countered with: “I just seen you give him a bag of cash.”
The streamer then tried to convince 21 that they would make money together, but the rapper wasn’t having it as he replied: “Bro, we gotta have a talk when I see you.”
