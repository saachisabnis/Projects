Kanye was celebrating the "number one song in the world" aka he and Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti, and Rich The Kid's "Carnival" which earned the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 this week. This was Kanye's fifth No. 1, Ty's second, and the first leader for Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid. However, as Ye was celebrating his song, he also didn't mind telling everyone how he felt about those who didn't support him.
"Rich Ty Carti and the supporters that stood by us through everything This number #1 is for you. It’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system," he wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post per HipHopDX.
The next lines are when Ye did not hold back on how he felt about Adidas who he was once partnered with for his Yeezy brand until his antisemitism in 2022.
"And f--- adidas and everybody who works there or with them. Anyone who goes to school with anyone whose parents work at adidas. Just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the number 1 song in the world."
He added: "Like the fake dude I saw in the lobby at the Ritz that works at Goat: you p----- don’t stand for s---. And f--- everybody at the Dailey Mail [sic]."
He then proceeded to speak on the  luxury fashion houses who also decided to drop him after his antisemitic statements. The rapper also specifically called out Hailey Bieber who is Justin Bieber's wife and a model who he has verbally attacked in the past. He also went after Drake who took Lil Durk on tour with him for the It's All A Blur: Big As The What tour as a coheadliner.
“And F--- everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber F--- each and every single one of yall And f--- every so called Christian and so called friend or so called family member that watched me have my kids taken out of my control.”
“That’s how I feel And it’s f--- Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more f--- you’s," he concluded.
Before Kanye was the rapper, entrepreneur, and trendsetting mogul that he is today, he got his start as a producer most notably working with Jay-Z. Back in 2000, Ye was signed to Roc Nation’s team of in-house producers and from there the rest is history. With over 20 years of experience in the music business, Ye has continued to raise the industry standard.
