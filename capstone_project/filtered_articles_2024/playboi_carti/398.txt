Playboi Carti followed through and delivered the Instagram gem “PLAY THIS.”
The short cut is available to stream only on his @opium_00pium Instagram account, and it remains unclear whether the track is in its final form or is an unfinished snippet. “PLAY THIS” arrives as another smooth offering from Carti as he raps over bouncy production work, with the artist commenting, “IM NOT DONE AT ALL DIS SUM COOL SH*T I WANTED YALL TO HEAR BC I LOVE DIS SONG BUT DA SHIT DATS ON MY ALBUM OVRLY TRIMM.”
“PLAY THIS” arrives after a series of drops from the artist, including the Travis Scott-enlisted “BACKROOMS,” “All Red,” “TIMELESS” with The Weeknd, “EvilJ0rdan” and more. It remains to be seen whether a majority of these songs will appear on his upcoming album I AM MUSIC, which he confirmed will be produced by Ye. Carti also revealed that the record may not include any guest features.
