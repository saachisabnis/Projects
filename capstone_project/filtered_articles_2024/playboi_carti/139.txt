DJ Akademiks has expressed being a fan of Playboi Carti’s music and marketing skills. However, the outspoken Rumble streamer was not a fan of the Atlanta native’s recent outfit.
Images of Playboi Carti lit up the internet on Tuesday (February 6). The photos and video showed the Whole Lotta Red album creator wearing what appeared to be a sheer thong bodysuit.
“It’s like a onesie. You basically button it at the bottom which means Carti gotta button the s### under his balls. This s### is wild,” Akademiks stated during a livestream.
Ak then said, “The onesie is even worse than the thong, bro. Like, my n#### actually walked out of the store like he was on some Ice Spice s###. Like he was just shaking ass in the deli.”
DJ Akademiks went on to call Playboi Carti a “non-binary vampire.” Additionally, the Off the Record podcaster brought up Iggy Azealia, the mother of Carti’s 3-year-old son Onyx.
He said, “This n#### not doing a m############ thing but playing with [Iggy Azealia’s] makeup, painting his face, trying on women’s clothes. Doing all types of s### that she’s supposed to be doing.”
Akademiks also suggested the viral pictures could be part of an intentional Playboi Carti rollout. The 27-year-old recording artist is expected to release the follow-up album to 2020’s Whole Lotta Red in 2024.
Whole Lotta Red became a commercial success. The AWGE/Interscope-backed project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 100,000 first-week units. Plus, Whole Lotta Red earned gold certification from the RIAA.
