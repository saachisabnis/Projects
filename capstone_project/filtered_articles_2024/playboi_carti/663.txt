Playboi Carti is getting an early start for the rollout of his upcoming album, MUSIC, with the release of his new single “All Red” and the unveiling of merch bundles.
The latest track clocks in at two-and-a-half minutes and features production work from F1LTHY, Ojivolta, Lucian, Lukrative and Twisco. As per his website, MUSIC will be offered in three different box sets and a digital album. Fans can choose between box sets that include a Black hoodie, T-shirt or cap, all of which feature branded designs. The bundles specify that the actual release date for the album will be announced, however the digital album offering states that it will be available “near the release date, no later than six months from April 18th, 2025.”
MUSIC is set to become Carti’s third studio album following Whole Lotta Red from December 2020. It was first teased about two years ago under the title Narcissist, but was then marketed as MUSIC in April 2022 then I AM MUSIC in December 2023 before reverting it back to its current title.
