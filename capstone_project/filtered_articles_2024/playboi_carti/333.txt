Joe Budden was not a fan of Travis Scott and Playboi Carti‘s performance at the 2024 Grammy Awards.
The outspoken New Jersey native discussed the show on the latest episode of his eponymous podcast, clips of which began being shared on Wednesday (February 7). And while he’s praised Travis’ latest album UTOPIA in the past, Budden apparently did not feel it translated to the Grammys stage.

“What the fuck is Travis and his man doing up here?” he questioned. “Hey, you two bozos! Get the fuck off the stage when n-ggas got beautiful women and tuxedos on, honestly. You up there smashing shit. You got the nerve.”
He continued: “All that shit look different when it ain’t a thousand little white kids jumping up and down. When there are grown people here, all that ‘FE!N, FE!N, FE!N,’ that’s what you wanted to win over Killer Mike? You’re fucking stupid! You bring your man out, Playboi Carti [and] the crowd just stays silent. Playboi Carti looked confused like, ‘Y’all don’t know who I am?’ No, n-gga! You got a fucking mask on.

“Who the fuck are you under there? You are not at SXSW anymore! We can’t recognize you bozos by the stocking mask you wearing. I hate these n-ggas, man, all of ’em! I love that song, I love that song, but not when tuxedos are out. Take that shit to the dirty Coachella grass, n-gga. N-ggas showered and lathered themselves tonight.”
Like Joe Budden mentioned, Travis Scott was upset that Killer Mike won Best Rap Album over UTOPIA, and called the Grammys out for snubbing him during his performance at the ceremony.
La Flame delivered a medley of UTOPIA tracks while on stage, and during a fiery rendition of “FE!N” alongside Playboi Carti, he ad-libbed the phrase: “They slept on me 10 times,” in reference to his 10 lifetime nominations but zero wins at the awards.

Scot closed out his set by smashing folding chairs against the ground, mirroring a segment of his Circus Maximus film.
The Houston native’s sole nomination at last night’s awards was for Best Rap Album, with UTOPIA going up against Nas‘ King’s Disease III, Metro Boomin‘s Heroes & Villains, Drake and 21 Savage‘s collaborative effort Her Loss, and eventual winner Killer Mike‘s Michael.

After the winner of Best Rap Album was announced, Scott appeared to voice his displeasure on X (formerly Twitter) by posting a raised eyebrow emoji.
Prior to the loss, the Cactus Jack creative had spoken about his enthusiasm for UTOPIA being nominated for Best Rap Album.
