Las Vegas is no stranger to spectacle.
Known for its neon lights and a certain unapologetic swagger, the city felt like a natural extension for ComplexCon ‚Äì‚Äì the cultural zeitgeist that has become synonymous with streetwear, hip-hop, food and cutting-edge art.
Making its Vegas debut this past weekend, November 16 and 17, ComplexCon didn't just land in the desert ‚Äî it owned it. From the moment you stepped into the Las Vegas Convention Center, it was clear that this wasn't just another trade show. It was a celebration, a flex, and a meeting of minds all at once.
Newsweek got to attend the festivities, and the sprawling venue was a maze of exclusive drops, immersive brand experiences, and panels featuring some of the most influential voices in the culture. Think of it as a utopia for the stylishly obsessed.
This year, Travis Scott and his visionary collective, Cactus Jack, elevated the game with the launch of CactusCon ‚Äî an innovative, immersive experience that redefined creativity, collaboration, and cultural engagement. Serving as Creative Director and headliner of ComplexCon 2024, Scott introduced more than 35 exclusive collaborations and installations, partnering with some of the world's most creative designers, artists, and brands.
At its core, ComplexCon has always been about fashion, and the Las Vegas edition took that to another level. It featured booths from must have brands like Nike ‚Äì‚Äì with it's 3d printed Air Max 1000 which was available by winning a slot machine onsite at the booth. Other favorites like Ohana Hatake, Feature, Saucony, sat alongside smaller, rising labels like Pizzaslime. The NLE Choppa x FCTRY Lab Duckboot collab turned heads, along with the Ed Hardy x Ken Carson collab.
The crowd was a perfectly curated mix of hypebeasts, fashion insiders, and curious creatives, all scanning the floor for the next must-have piece. Long lines and high energy wasn't just expected; it was a part of the experience. Celebrities and music heavyweights were spotted in around the festival, in addition to Scott, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Playboi Carti, Machine Gun Kelly, Offset, 2 Chainz, Lil Yachty, Metro Boomin, Gunna, Xzibit, Sheck Wes, Cody Rhodes, FUTURA, Big Sean, Angel Reese, Big Boy, and FaZe Banks made appearances, amongst others.
Yet the true heart of ComplexCon is discovery. Wandering through the aisles, attendees stumbled upon niche designers from around the globe ‚Äî the kind of labels you'll likely be name-dropping in six months when their pieces start popping up on your Instagram feed.
Music isn't just an accessory at ComplexCon either; it's the lifeblood. The Vegas lineup pulled no punches, with performances from Scott, Don Toliver, Metro Boomin and Playboi Carti , each bringing their own flavor to the event. Scott's' set, as expected, was pure adrenaline, proving his influence is unmatched.
ComplexCon's dedication to culinary culture shined bright with Family Style, an outdoor food festival spotlighting some of today's most buzzworthy restaurant brands. Newsweek was able to savor mouthwatering bites from Trill Burgers (whose line didn't seem to stop all day), Big B's Texas BBQ, Sorry Not Sorry Creamery, and Camel Coffee adding a delicious finish to the day.
Collaboration didn't stop in the fashion aspects, it made its way to the culinary side as well. Vegas favorite Lotus of Siam collaborated with Billionaire Boys Club, while Howlin' Rays joined forces with Hellstar with some fire chicken and fashion.
ComplexCon's Las Vegas debut wasn't just a move westward; it was a bold statement. The city's ethos of reinvention and larger-than-life ambition aligned perfectly with the event's mission to push culture forward. Las Vegas, a place where dreams are made and broken in the same night, felt like the ideal home for an event that thrives on risk and creativity.
If ComplexCon Las Vegas proved anything, it's that the intersection of culture, fashion, and music isn't a trend ‚Äî it's the future. And that future looks very, very bright.
