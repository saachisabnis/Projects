Playboi Carti has yet to release a new album. Over the last few months, while he has shared some official material, a number of unofficial leaks have also emerged. A recently leaked track caught fans' attention for apparently taking a jab at Adin Ross, featuring what seems to be a phone call recording of the streamer at the start. The song itself offers a more understated vibe typical of this era for Carti, but it's unclear if this is meant to be a serious diss or just a joke. Regardless, it seems he’s playing into the drama, and it’s likely that Adin isn’t pleased, especially after the money Carti made off him during their unsuccessful livestream together. This isn't the first instance where a Playboi Carti leak has appeared to insult Adin Ross or executives at the Kick streaming platform. In an unreleased version of "Type S**t" featuring Future, Metro Boomin, and Travis Scott, he raps, "I scammed a billionaire, woah," which is an odd brag but still a noteworthy line. Adin Ross has expressed his frustration with Carti, critiquing his latest social media single, "KETAMINE," calling it "trash" and a way to handle the recent security footage he posted from their livestream. Fans from both sides tend to poke fun at the rivalry, likely enjoying the spectacle rather than taking it too seriously. Adin commented on the possibility of a collaboration, saying he doubts Carti 2 will happen. 
He suspects Carti was just messaging him to keep him from speaking negatively about him online. Adin believes he was deceived, noting that their communication stopped unexpectedly. He plans to release the warehouse footage once he confirms the collaboration won’t take place, questioning if this amounts to blackmail but feeling justified in light of his own experience.
