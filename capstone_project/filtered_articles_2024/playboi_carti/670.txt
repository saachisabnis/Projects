	Boosie was one of the first to deliver the news on X. “JUST GOT WORD @RichHomieQuan JUST [DIED]. JUST TALK TO WUAN THE OTHER DAY,” he wrote. “JUST TALKED TO YOU BRA #tipQUAN Never go forget yo smile n the way talked n of course yo music.”

	










	Jacquees, who has been a close collaborator of Rich Homie Quan’s for the last decade, wrote on X: “Rest in peace my brother Rich Homie Quan. I Love you for life. #Richgang,” he shared alongside a photo with Quan.

	Fellow ATLien Playboi Carti also posted clips and photos to his Instagram Story on Thursday of Quan and Young Thug.

Quavo added in photos of the Migos with RHQ and Thugger to his IG Story and emotionally wrote in tribute to his late nephew TakeOff and Quan: “May god be with US never saw this as part of our journey.”

	Rich Homie Quan emerged alongside Young Thug as part of a tidal wave that cemented Atlanta as the rap capital of the world in the mid-2010s. He made a splash with his debut on the charts in 2013 when his “Type of Way” anthem peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	Quan netted a pair of top 20 Hot 100 wins with his assists on platinum records like YG’s “My Hitta” (No. 19) featuring Jeezy and Rich Gang’s ubiquitous “Lifestyle” (No. 16) with Thugger, which has earned 926.8 million on-demand official U.S. streams, according to Luminate.

	RHQ earned his solo peak on the Hot 100 with “Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh).” The smooth Nitti-produced banger hit No. 12 on the chart in July 2015 and has accumulated 608 million on-demand official U.S. streams, per Luminate.

	Quan returned to the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart this week thanks to his guest appearance on Travis Scott’s “Mamacita,” which hit No. 26 after being re-released to streaming for the first time in celebration of the 10th anniversary of La Flame’s 2014 Days Before Rodeo mixtape.

	Motown Records came calling and inked Rich Homie Quan to a deal in 2017, where he released his Back to the Basics mixtape (No. 84 Billboard 200) and followed up with his Rich As in Spirit debut album (No. 32 Billboard 200) in 2018.

	










	To date, according to Luminate, Quan’s catalog has compiled 3.34 billion on-demand official U.S. streams. More recently, he independently released singles such as “Ah’chi” with 2 Chainz and “Authentic” earlier in 2024. His last project came with Family & Mula – Reloaded in 2022 via Rich Homie Entertainment. 

Jack Harlow recruited RHQ to perform at his debut Gazebo Festival, where he took the stage in Louisville back in May.
