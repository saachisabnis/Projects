Iggy Azalea is seemingly unfazed by the controversy that Playboi Carti, the father of her child, has caused recently due to his wardrobe choices.
On Saturday (February 10), Azalea shared a sultry post on Instagram in which she appeared to be smoking in her bathroom while wearing lingerie. In the comment section of the post, which has since garnered more than 400,000 likes, one troll in particular managed to gain Azalea’s attention by attempting to make a swipe at her and Carti all at once. 
“Yo BD out here in the same outfit,” the user wrote, to which Azalea responded, “Well, who wore it better?”
Playboi Carti went viral earlier this week after photos of an outfit he wore to the studio while working with Kanye West began circulating online. The photos and video showed the Whole Lotta Red artist wearing what appeared to be a sheer bodysuit that many social media users argued could be considered a thong.
