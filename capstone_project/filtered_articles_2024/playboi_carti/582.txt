Playboi Carti has released the new song “All Red.” He made the track with producers F1lthy, Ojivolta, Lucian, Lukrative, and Twisco. Listen to it below.
Carti has posted music—such as “2024,” “Backr00ms,” and “EvilJ0rdan”—on social media and his YouTube channel in recent years, but “All Red” is his first official solo song to appear across digital streaming platforms since the Christmas 2020 release of Whole Lotta Red.
Along with “All Red,” Carti has made his long-teased album Music available to pre-order on his website. It does not currently have a release date.
