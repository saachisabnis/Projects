Playboi Carti has hopped on Camila Cabello’s highly anticipated new Gucci Mane-sampling single “I LUV IT.”
On the track, the pop star drops a post-chorus that features a sample of Gucci’s classic track “Lemonade.” The song also interpolates Rihanna’s 2011 track “Cockiness (Love It).”

Playboi Carti delivers a mealy-mouthed guest verse, slurring words together in the way only he can.
He raps: “Oh, you on the road now?/ Oh, you grown now? Oh, you too grown now/ You tryna take your time by your ‘lone/ All this novocaine got ’em numb to the drugs now.”
The accompanying video features Camila losing a wrestling match, eating chocolate, being chased by a dog and more before her and Carti link up at a convenience store.
“Certain things in our human realm do make me feel like I’m in outer space, and the very rare few times where I’ve had incredible chemistry with someone is one of them,” Cabello said in a statement about the track’s inspiration.

“Part of that cocktail is also the emotional drama between you and that person, and the chaos and butterflies and nerves and passion,” she added. “It’s unsustainable and not peaceful and exhausting, but also, I LUV IT.”
Check out the new visual below.
This new single continues the duo’s highly scrutinized relationship.
At the end of 2023, Carti shared a FaceTime screenshot that Cabello presumably sent him. The front-facing camera shot shows her face on a call to “Jordan,” which is the rapper’s real name.

Though the two didn’t publicly commented on the specifics of their relationship, they didn’t seem concerned about keeping it a secret either.
It is unclear how long Playboi Carti and Cabello have known each other or what circumstances brought them together, but they teased being in the studio together in December, which likely served as the session where they created “I LUV IT.”

Later that month, he took to his Instagram Story and posted a flick next to the former Fifth Harmony singer inside his workspace. What raised eyebrows, however, is the caption, which read: “Baby Girl.”
Fans were delighted to hear Carti on the new single, though it was just earlier this week that he disappointed his diehard fans, when it was confirmed that he officially pulled the plug on his highly anticipated Antagonist Tour.

The international trek was initially announced for the second half of 2023, but was postposed just days before it was scheduled to commence. Every date of the tour was called off, with some listed as postponed while others were canceled altogether.
The Atlanta rapper’s plans remain unclear as of now. In what was likely a glitch rather than an actual rescheduling, his Ticketmaster page currently has a number of the aborted events listed under the date of January 6, 2026.

Without specifying a cause, the website has shared the following statement: “Unfortunately, the Event Organizer has had to cancel your event.”
