Playboi Carti says he wants to preview his long-awaited project during his headlining set at Rolling Loud Miami. On Wednesday, November 27, the Atlanta native posted a flyer for his closing performance at the 10th anniversary of Rolling Loud Miami. He reposted the same image on Opium's Instagram page where he promised to play tracks from his upcoming third studio album I AM MUSIC. His promise comes nearly a year after he officially began the rollout for his next LP. "I AM MUSIC WILL B PLAYED," he wrote in the caption. "KANT WAIT TO SEE YAL MFS NAH FR." 
Playboi Carti had fans going wild when he dropped tracks like "2024" and "H00dByAir" before the new year began. His viral hits had fans convinced that he would release the album on Christmas like he did for his previous LP Whole Lotta Red. Once the holiday passed, Carti hit the ground running in 2024 by dropping other hits like "Backr00ms" featuring Travis Scott, "EvilJ0rdan" and "Ketamine." He spent the year previewing other songs that may appear on the album like "All Red" and "F**k On My DJ," which he debuted at Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash in June. Months after teasing the album title, Carti confirmed in a social post he made in September that his upcoming project will be known as I AM MUSIC. As of this report, there is no confirmed release date. The 29-year-old artist plans to close out Rolling Loud Miami following other anticipated sets from Future, Travis Scott, Metro Boomin, Shaboozey, BossMan Dlow and more. The biggest hip-hop music festival in the world goes down December 13 - December 15 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. Tickets are on sale now.
