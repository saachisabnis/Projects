Cabello’s new record is awaited by her fans and by critics, who expect her to show a new side of her music. It also appears to be her record with the most collaborations with other artists.
“To me, it’s about going out more, going to more parties and just being a bit more fearless and rebellious,” said Cabello when discussing her new record and new mindset to Billboard. “Before, I would go out and not care about what I looked like. If I felt kind of ugly, it was whatever — but now, I always want to feel pretty for myself.“
