Playboi Carti  has left his fans disappointed yet again, this time by finally pulling the plug on his highly anticipated Antagonist Tour.
The international trek was initially announced for the second half of 2023, but was postposed just days before it was scheduled to commence. On Monday (March 26), every date of the tour was called off, with some listed as postponed while other have been canceled altogether.

The Atlanta rapper’s plans remain unclear as of now. In what is likely a glitch rather than an actual rescheduling, his Ticketmaster page currently has a number of the aborted events listed under the date of January 6, 2026.
Without specifying a cause, the website has shared the following statement: “Unfortunately, the Event Organizer has had to cancel your event.”

Refunds are currently being processed.
“i guess we’ll never get playboi carti’s unreleased antagonisttour merch,” one fan tweeted, while another added: “That antagonisttour was wild, it didn’t even seem real.”
One social media user expressed their frustration at the whole situation, writing: “so basically i’m gonna fucking kill myself bc 1. the antagonist tour was canceled & 2. cashapp closed my acc so i actually cannot get my $200 back and im so upset!”

In other news, Playboi Carti recently debuted a new look that generated quite a reaction from his fans, with many comparing him to fictional character Wednesday Addams.
The controversial rapper took to his Instagram Live last week to showed off his straight, jet-black hair, which had been parted down the middle and styled into two long braids that went down the side of his face and onto his chest.
