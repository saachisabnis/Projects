	When Birdman oversaw the supergroup Rich Gang, Quan became a standout on songs like “Lifestyle” with Young Thug, with whom he’d made the majority of the 2014 mixtape Rich Gang: Tha Tour Pt. 1.











	“I just want people to appreciate the music,” he said in an interview a day before his death, claiming he’d release the project before his Oct. 4 birthday. “The times we in, you play a song and that shit old in two days. When I get in the studio, I’m passionate about it, so I don’t want to drop music on deaf ears. I want to have marketing — I want to cross my T’s and dot my I’s.”
