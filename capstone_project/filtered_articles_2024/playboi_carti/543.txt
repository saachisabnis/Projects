Nick Young commented on his ex-girlfriend, Iggy Azalea's ex-boyfriend Playboi Carti’s choice of clothing. Young voiced his reaction to an image of Carti sporting a thong bodysuit, suggesting that the star was going too far to stand out. He speculated that Carti was teasing the idea of being gay for attention. Vlad and Young called out celebrities who flirt with culturally-defined and traditionally female or queer fashions for attention or shock value, asserting that if that is their true identity, they should just come out. Young expressed that he's careful with his own choices as he doesn’t want his sons to mimic potentially disingenuous actions. The conversation ended with both agreeing that pretending to fit a different sexual orientation for the sake of attention is not a commendable approach.
