Playboi Carti says his obsessive fanbase drove him out of his former home ahead of his highly-anticipated album. On Tuesday, September 3, Billboard revealed its new Power Players cover story featuring an interview with the Opium founder. During the conversation, Carti recalled how fans figured out where his mother lived last year and sent her flowers. Although it seemed like a genuine gesture,  fans crossed a line when they discovered his home address. The situation was so bad that Carti had to find another place to live. “I’m very blessed,” Carti says. “But it is frustrating because [that’s where] we have to lay our heads.”
Playboi Carti's fans have grown increasingly impatient amid the Georgia native's forthcoming third studio album I Am Music. The follow-up to his 2020 LP Whole Lotta Red has been in the works for quite some time. He's been cooped up inside his Mean Street studio in Atlanta for hours on end alongside revered producer Cardo, who produced Carti's recent single "H00DBYAIR." At this point, even Cardo is fed up with Carti's fanbase.  “It’s cool, but they got to stop threatening me,” Cardo quipped. “He’s putting it together! He isn’t rushing it.” Playboi Carti has been teasing the album for the past few months. After delivering his "2024" single at the tail-end of 2023, Carti surprised fans with his collaboration with Travis Scott "BACKR00MS." According to Billboard, Carti and Cardo have a name for the sound they developed while making the album. Cardo explained "burnt music" is inspired by the likes of DJ Toomp, DJ Paul, Juicy J, and The Legendary Traxster with a hint of horror icon John Carpenter’s movies.  “We’ll be in the studio, like, ‘This music is burnt,’ ” Cardo said. Playboi Carti's I Am Music is reportedly scheduled to arrive by the end of the year, which might arrive just in time for his headlining set at Rolling Loud Miami.
