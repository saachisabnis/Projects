If you had told me four years ago that I’d be streaming the likes of TikTok sensation Addison Rae’s music, I would simply not believe you — but 2024 has had many surprises in store for us. Following her viral hit, “Diet Pepsi,” and a successful feature alongside Charli XCX on the remix of “Von Dutch” and a performance at the Madison Square Garden stop for the Sweat Tour, Addison Rae solidified her standing in the pop world with the highly anticipated single “Aquamarine.” 
The track builds upon her artistry and sound through its melodic synth-pop production, enveloping you as though you had just dramatically fallen upon a bed of feathers. The song exudes a high-fashion, Hollywood glamor vibe, evoking images of pearls draped around your neck as you strut across a candle-lit restaurant. 
“The world is my oyster /
Baby come and touch the pearl /
The world is my oyster /
And I’m the only girl.”
The introduction hooks listeners with its sexual innuendos, deep-sea metaphors and dreamy vocals, reminiscent of a siren’s call (I’m noticing a pattern with the songs I write about). Nostalgic but still modern, “Aquamarine” is a refreshing take on the early 2000s pop sound, echoing the likes of hallmark artists like Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue, yet is still self-defining. I believe this is why the track stands out so much in the landscape of modern pop artists and music — they simply don’t have that star factor, it-girl image like they used to. While Rae had not started out her music career on strong footing, once she began to brush shoulders and collaborate with icons like Charli XCX, did she start to refine her sound and chic persona.
“I’m dancing in my own reflection /
I’m the ray of light /
I’m transforming and realigning /
I’ll take you with me, high, high, high, high.”
She highlights this herself through these lines, reflecting on the rebrand and the changes she has embraced throughout her journey from TikTok star to now, a legitimized artist. 
Despite its positive reception and oceanic vibe, the track feels as though it is missing out on its full potential and lasting effect on listeners’ ears, ending as abruptly as it begins. To truly reach pop girl stardom, Rae has some work cut out for her in the polishing of her lyricism and production. Nevertheless, “Aquamarine” is a leg-up from the previous release “Diet Pepsi” and paints an image of the Greek goddess of beauty, Aphrodite herself. The single will be featured on Rae’s debut album, AR1, which is expected to drop sometime in 2025. 
In the meantime, I will be relentlessly practicing the choreography portrayed in the music video, and have this song queued whenever I am near a body of water and feeling glamorous.
