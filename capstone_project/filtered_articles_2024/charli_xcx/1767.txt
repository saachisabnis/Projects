i can’t see how Charli will have enough pop support to beat Ariana to a pop duo nomination

She’s got more rising support than Beyonce/Miley, Ari, Coldplay and the AI Beatles. I’d argue that Pop Duo is a lock for her. 
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
Get real!  Charli XCX & Lorde are NOT happening in Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.  Pure delusion.  There are like 10 contenders ahead of that crap.

It’s happening. The other contenders have zero momentum. Aside from Fortnight, and maybe Beyonce/Miley, it’s wide open. Charlie’s got one of the biggest pop star narratives, she’s ahead of the name recognition all-stars

Hopefully, but we already saw last year that checknames are worth more to voters than actually popular songs.
It's me... Hi

Honey, Charli XCX is only happening in Best Dance Pop Recording.  Homegirl is NOT popular enough to get in over bigger Pop names.
Would it be a longshot to say that not my fault get nominated for duo/performance
Honey, “Not My Fault” is NOT happening in Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

Honestly, that category would be her well-deserved first win. Category was created for her style of music, so I’m perfectly fine with that.
But yeah, still saying she’s nominated for Pop Duo as well.

lock is total delusion. Charli is not the type of artist pop voters lean towards. any Ariana remix will get in before her based on Ariana’s name alone

 ok but like why
 ok but like why
it didn’t even chart on the hot 100 and Renee is not nearly a big enough name to make up for that

 I mean candy necklace didn’t chart and got nominated, and the SNL performance was pretty big and megan is a big name so I could see it happening, its the most poppy collaboration of the year imo
