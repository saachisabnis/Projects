Matty Healy has fully moved on from Taylor Swift, it seems. The 1975 singer is sparking engagement rumors with Gabbriette Bechtel.
Bechtel, 26, flashed a large black diamond ring on her left hand in a series of Instagram Story posts uploaded in the early hours of Wednesday, June 12. The photos and videos of Bechtel appeared to be taken during Charli XCX’s Brooklyn concert.
“MARRYING THE 1975 IS VERY BRAT,” Bechtel captioned a photo showing off her ring, referencing Charli XCX’s album BRAT, which was released on Friday, June 7. (Charli XCX is currently engaged to The 1975 drummer, George Daniel.)
In a second photo, Bechtel shared another look at the ring in a mirror selfie.
Healy, 35, has yet to address any engagement rumors. However, he did repost Bechtel’s Instagram Story. Us Weekly has reached out for comment.
Following a whirlwind romance with Swift, 34, last summer, Healy moved on with Bechtel in September 2023. The musician and model were photographed kissing in New York City on what appeared to be a date. Since then, Bechtel has attended various events with Healy, even offering a look into their relationship on Instagram.
Late last month, Bechtel — a model and musician — offered rare details about her romantic connection with Healy.
“I think that we just both enjoy good food, honestly. He’s taught me a lot about food,” she told E! News, adding that they “have the same taste in music.”
Further discussing their relationship, Bechtel revealed a recent meal she made for the singer.
“The last thing I did was a really good kale salad with pine nuts,” she said. “Parmesan, sexy little skirt steak and I did potato gratin.”

As Healy and Bechtel continue to strengthen their relationship, The 1975 singer is staying unbothered by songs written by ex-girlfriend Swift that appear to reference their short-lived fling.
Swift — who has since moved on with Travis Kelce — and Healy called off their brief relationship in June 2023. When she dropped The Tortured Poets Department on April 19, fans were quick to speculate that some songs shared the untold story of what went down between the exes. Tracks like “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and “But Daddy I Love Him” are speculated to be about Healy.
“He loves the attention it’s brought to him, [but] he also thinks it’s hilarious because at no time [were they] ever serious,” a friend close to Healy told Us Weekly earlier this month, referring to TTPD. Healy was reportedly “completely blindsided” by Swift’s lyrics, the insider added. “He’s taking it in stride.”
