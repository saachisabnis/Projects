As the week in music comes to a close, Hypebeast has rounded up the best projects for the latest installment of Best New Tracks.
This week’s lineup is led by albums coming from JPEGMAFIA, Khalid, and Killer Mike and singles from Doechii, A$AP Rocky x Jessica Pratt, Charli XCX x Billie Eilish, NAV x Cash Cobain x Bay Swag, Kitschkreig x Future x Fridayy x Mariah The Scientist, Big Sean and Mike Will Made-It x Lil Wayne x Lil Yachty.
JPEGMAFIA has unleashed his fifth studio album: I LAY DOWN MY LIFE. Tapping into trap, punk and even jazz-inspired subgenres, I LAY DOWN MY LIFE is another high-octane Peggy offering. The LP spans 14 tracks and sees features from Vince Staples on “New Black History” and Denzel Curry on “JPEGULTRA!”

Khalid – Sincere

Khalid has returned. Sincere signals his first LP since 2021’s Scenic Drive, and is exactly what listeners were vying for from the musician. “It was a very difficult process in naming this album because I had to find one that summed up what I really felt in this music,” he shared. “I thought of [this project] as my most vulnerable in a while.” The 16-track delivery is primarily a solo effort, with one feature coming from Arlo Parks on “Breathe.”

Killer Mike – Songs for Sinners and Saints

After announcing the project at the top of this week, Killer Mike’s Songs for Sinners and Saints has surfaced. An even 10-track effort, the album finds the rapper opening up about recent trials and tribulations post-MICHAEL. “For me this album is a testimonial,” Killer Mike explained in a statement.  “When I was growing up an important part of church service was people having the opportunity to stand up and give public testimony on their trials, tribulations, and triumphs. After the celebratory atmosphere that followed MICHAEL I was reminded that tribulations never cease, but God is always with me.”

A$AP Rocky x Jessica Pratt – “HIGHJACK”

Rocky’s first release since the announcement of his fourth studio album, Don’t Be Dumb, “HIGHJACK” is a high-octane first-look at what we can expect from the highly anticipated LP. With contributions from Jessica Pratt and Jon Batiste on backing vocals, the head-banging “HIGHJACK” was produced by Rocky himself.

Charli XCX x Billie Eilish – “Guess featuring Billie Eilish”

For the latest Brat remix, Charli XCX has tapped none other than fellow it-girl Billie Eilish to contribute to fan-favorite cut “Guess.” After teasing the remix with the faceless cover art on Instagram earlier this week, fans were quick to discern that the artist next to Charli in the photo was Eilish.
