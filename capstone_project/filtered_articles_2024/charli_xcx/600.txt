Teddy Swims’ “The Door” continues its climb at pop radio, securing a Top 20 position on this week’s Mediabase chart for the format. Isabel LaRosa’s “favorite” and Charli XCX’s “360” concurrently join the Top 30.
Smith’s “Pathetic” meanwhile ranks as the chart’s lone debut, climbing inside the latest Top 40.
— Played 3,586 times during the July 28-August 3 tracking period, “The Door” ascends one level to #20. The song’s spin count reflects a week-over-week gain of 337.
