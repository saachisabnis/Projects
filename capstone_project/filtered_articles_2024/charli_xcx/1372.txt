Charli XCX is ready to make waves in the acting world with her next big role. The 32-year-old pop sensation, known for her edgy style and chart-topping hits, is set to star alongside Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman in the upcoming film I Want Your Sex. Directed by Gregg Araki, the movie is already generating buzz as a provocative thriller that promises to push boundaries and captivate audiences.
The news of Charli’s involvement was confirmed by Deadline, sparking excitement among her fans and the film industry alike. However, the details of her role remain under wraps, adding an air of mystery to her new project. Given Charli’s bold and daring persona in the music industry, it’s easy to imagine her taking on a character that’s equally fearless and complex.
So, what’s the movie all about? The film’s synopsis reads: “When fresh-faced Elliot (Hoffman) lands an exciting job for renowned artist, icon and provocateur Erika Tracy (Wilde), his fantasies come true as Erika taps him to become her sexual muse. But Elliot soon finds himself out of his depth as Erika takes him on a journey more profound than he ever could have imagined, into a world of sex, obsession, power, betrayal and murder.”
With production set to begin in October, the film will be shot in Los Angeles, a city that perfectly complements the film’s edgy and provocative theme. Fans are eager to see how Charli will fit into this intense narrative, especially since this marks her second major acting role. Her acting debut is slated to happen in the remake of Faces of Death, another project that has piqued the interest of both her fans and film enthusiasts.
For those familiar with Charli XCX’s work, her transition into acting feels like a natural evolution. Known for pushing the envelope in her music videos and performances, she has always brought a cinematic quality to her artistry. Her songs often explore themes of love, power, and rebellion, which align closely with the storyline of I Want Your Sex. It will be fascinating to see how she channels these themes in a narrative film setting.
With production kicking off soon, the anticipation for I Want Your Sex is building, and Charli XCX is undoubtedly set to make a memorable impact in this thrilling new venture.
