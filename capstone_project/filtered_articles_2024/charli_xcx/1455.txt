Charli XCX described The 1975 frontman Matty Healy’s on-stage protest kiss, which shut down a Malaysian music festival last year, as “a little divisive, but I think great art is divisive”.
In July 2023, Healy made a speech about homosexuality, which is illegal in Malaysia, and kissed bass player Ross MacDonald during the band’s headline performance at the Good Vibes Festival in Kuala Lumpur.
