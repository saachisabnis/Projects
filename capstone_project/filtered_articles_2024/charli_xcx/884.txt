The wait for new music is (nearly) over! Charli XCX has taken to her socials to confirm that her upcoming new album ‘brat’ will arrive this summer, on 7th June. 
Having previously teased that it would be “15 songs. 41:23 minutes long. on repeat.”, she has now also unveiled the LP’s full tracklist - and don’t worry people, it is indeed set to include her recent, pounding instant-classic ‘Von dutch’. 
‘brat’ is set to be Charli’s sixth studio album (following on from 2022’s ‘CRASH’) and the release will see her step firmly into a new era, after last year’s two sucker-punch singles (Sam Smith collab ‘In The City’ and Barbie soundtrack cut ‘Speed Drive’) further cemented her status as one of the planet’s greatest pop stars. 
You can dive into ‘brat”s full tracklist and check out the video for ‘Von dutch’ below.
