A Charli XCX-inspired update for the 'Dress To Impress' game has launched

Roblox users can finally have a ‘Brat’ summer, with a new Charli XCX-inspired update launching over the weekend.
The newest update for the Dress To Impress Roblox game features a number of new ‘Brat’-inspired outfits, as well as poses, hairstyles and makeup allowing users to have the most ‘Brat’ summer possible.
The update has also redecorated the lobby and dressing room to match the aesthetic of Charli XCX’s newest album. Six new poses have also been added, with the likes of ‘Reference Baby’, ‘So Julia’, ‘Von Dutch’, Bumpn’ That’ and ‘Apple Dance’ all inspired by XCX’s ‘Brat’. Players can keep all the new additions, but they must log in during the event to claim them.
Roblox has yet to announce when the ‘Brat’ event will end, but these limited-time Dress To Impress updates typically stay live for two weeks.

Last week, Charli XCX teased a new remix on TikTok as she prepares to head into “Brat Autumn”. The new track appears to sample  Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’ and would follow on from the Billie Eilish-featuring remix of ‘Guess’. It comes after several think pieces were published that declared Brat Summer to be dead after Charli XCX tweeted “Kamala IS brat”, following Joe Biden endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential race.
Charli XCX is due to take ‘Brat’ on the road in the coming months. She’s got a co-headline tour with Troye Sivan that kicks off in September before she returns to the UK for her biggest ever UK tour. 
So far in 2024, Roblox has launched collabs with The Rolling Stones and the UK General Election.
In other news, Activision reportedly filed a cease and desist letter against a fan-made Call Of Duty mod because they were worried it would impact Black Ops 6 sales.
