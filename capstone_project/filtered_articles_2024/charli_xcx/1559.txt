The Mercury Prize 2024 recognises and celebrates the albums released between July 15, 2023 and July 12, 2024. The independent judging panel for this year's prize comprises Danielle Perry, Jamie Cullum, Jamz Supernova, Lea Stonhill, Mistajam, Phil Alexander, Sian Eleri, Will Hodgkinson, Sophie Williams and Jeff Smith, who is the Chair of the panel.
The winner will be announced in September, with further details of the award ceremony to be released in due course. However, there will be no ticketed public event for the first time in its 32-year history, with the usual live final element being scrapped in favour of "other extensive promotional activity." Dr Jo Twist OBE, CEO of the BPI, home of The Mercury Prize, said:
“The Mercury Prize is a cherished part of our cultural landscape, celebrating the art of the album and recognising the exceptional creative achievements of diverse British and Irish artists across the many different genres that make up our thriving and global-facing music scene.
“We are delighted to deepen our relationship with our long-term partner BBC Music to promote the Prize across its networks, including its national broadcast and digital channels, to ensure the greatest possible impact and profile as part of a wider campaign to support the artists who produced the 12 Albums of the Year. 
“For the 2024 Mercury Prize we will work imaginatively with the BBC to deliver a premium programme of music content and digital engagement that will, as ever, benefit all 12 artists in reaching a wider audience, providing an important platform for their evolving career and musical journey.”
Last year, the prize was won by Ezra Collective for their album 'Where I’m Meant To Be'.
