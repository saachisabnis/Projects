Fragrance is more than just a beauty essential; it’s a deeply personal expression of self. It can transport you back in time, evoke powerful nostalgia, and even offer insight into your own identity and sexuality. And because of this intimate connection, it's intensely interesting to discover which scents our favorite people are drawn to—celebrities included.
While many stars have ventured into launching their own fragrance lines, plenty still reach for the same department store classics as the rest of us. Case in point: Charli XCX, the queen of clubbing and our muse for staying out past 9 P.M. on a school night, wears Byredo’s dark academia-coded Bibliothèque, while Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo has sworn by Jo Malone London’s Myrrh & Tonka Cologne Intense after a chance encounter at a duty-free counter.
These stars' choices prove that they gravitate toward scents that tell a story about themselves—much like we do. Whether it’s nostalgia, comfort, or boldness they seek, these are the same bottles we either have on our vanities or will soon be racing to try ourselves. Below, we’ve rounded up our favorite celebrities and the fragrances they’re obsessed with.
Charli's Favorite: Byredo Bibliothèque
Byredo
Nordstrom
Saks Fifth Avenue
Now that we’ve established that “brat” isn’t a fleeting summer mood but a year-round lifestyle, why not follow the lead of our favorite party girl muse when it comes to scent? In a TikTok for British GQ, Charli XCX revealed Byredo’s Bibliothèque as one of her essentials. While she’s a fan of many Byredo fragrances, Bibliothèque is her current favorite — a moody mix of plum and cinnamon top notes with a patchouli and vanilla base that evoke the feeling of getting lost in a leather-bound book at the library. Consider it dark academia in a bottle. “People say I overspray, but that’s their problem.” Same, girl.
Taylor's Favorite: Tom Ford Santal Blush
Tom Ford
Nordstrom
Bluemercury
Saks Fifth Avenue
What we didn’t expect was to fall in love with Taylor’s reported favorite fragrance: Tom Ford’s Santal Blush. If you didn't already know, Swift admitted at the MTV Video Music Awards in response to a friend complimenting her scent, mouthing “you smell so good” that she does, indeed wear Tom Ford. Santal Blush is warm, woodsy, and earthy. Described as “exotic spices enhanced with luxe ylang ylang, warm cinnamon, and sumptuous woods…earthy and woody”—delicious.
Hailey's Favorite: Ex Nihilo Fleur Narcotique
Ex Nihilo
Amazon
"Sophisticated" is the word that best describes Ex Nihilo Fleur Narcotique Eau de Parfum, an intoxicating blend of peony, lychee, peach, and musk. Close your eyes and imagine your most glamorous friend—we guarantee they smell like this. Our most glamorous friend (and yes, we are friends) is Hailey Bieber, queen of nail trends and, well... pretty much everything else. She revealed to Harper's Bazaar UK that she “always goes back” to this sensual fragrance.
Olivia's Favorite: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540
Maison Francis Kurkdjian
Nordstrom
Let’s share a moment of vulnerability, shall we? We’ve all eyed Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 at department stores and calculated how long it would take to save for the splurge. But trust us: it’s worth every penny for the staying power alone. The scent is also unique, blending floral jasmine with a subtle woody note—perfect if you don't want to smell overwhelmingly like a bouquet. Just ask Olivia Rodrigo, who notes it as a fragrance she can’t live without to GQ. “I don’t love smelling like candy or flowers, but this kind of smells like you naturally would if you were, like, an angel or something.” She’s halfway through the bottle in the video so you know she’s using it consistently.
Gracie's Favorite: Diptyque Olène Eau de Toilette
Diptyque
Nordstrom
If Diptyque’s luxe packaging isn’t enough to win you over, their scent is love at first spritz. Or shall we say, something you’ll want to have close to you? We digress. Gracie Abrams, the singer behind the current soundtrack of our lives and hero of our Spotify playlists, is a fan of the wisteria-, jasmine-, and honeysuckle-dripping Olène Eau de Toilette. “I love the smell of jasmine, and Diptyque crushed it with this,” she told The Strategist. “I got it while on tour because I wanted something that smelled floral, not in a sweet way, but like if you walked through a garden at night.” Gracie notes she also goes back and forth between this and Glossier You.
Sydney's Favorite: Daisy by Marc Jacobs
Marc Jacobs
Nordstrom
Sydney Sweeney told The Cut that she's a fan of Marc Jacobs Daisy, praising its subtlety. It's not overpowering, but as Sweeney puts it, "if you want someone to smell it, it means they're close enough to you." This decades-old classic blends notes of strawberry, violet leaves, and jasmine for an airy, timeless floral finish that won’t leave you smelling too strongly like a bodega bouquet.
Cynthia's Favorite: Jo Malone London Myrrh & Tonka Cologne Intense
Jo Malone
Nordstrom
Bluemercury
Wicked is the next blockbuster Barbehneimer — we’re calling it now — and the supremely talented Cynthia Erivo will play a large factor in that. And her favorite fragrance to wear whilst belting out gravity-defying tunes? Jo Malone London Myrrh & Tonka Cologne Intense. Once a fan of rotating fragrances, a chance duty-free discovery led her to this new signature scent. She told The Strategist, “It’s so sweet and smoky at the same time, and it just works with my body chemistry.”
Lili's Favorite: Acqua di Gioia Eau de Parfum Spray
Armani Beauty
Amazon
Nordstrom
At Coachella last year, Lili Reinhart told Glamour that her all-time favorite fragrance is Acqua di Gioia Eau de Parfum. It’s designed to capture the essence of laying beach-side on the Mediterranean, with top notes of mint leaves, brown sugar, and Italian lemon zest, middle notes of jasmine, peony, pink pepper and a base of cedarwood and labdanum. It’s basically Positano in a bottle, perfect for transporting your mind to vacation whilst sitting in your cubicle.
Snoop's Favorite: Parfums de Marly Delina Eau de Parfum
Parfums de Marly
Amazon
Nordstrom
A quick scroll through perfume TikTok will inevitably lead you to countless videos (we’re talking thousands upon thousands) raving about Parfums de Marly Delina Eau de Parfum. With pretty pink packaging that looks like it was transported from Marie-Antoinette’s bathroom, it’s a vanity must-have. The fragrance itself offers a soft, powdery rose scent—think Parisian boudoir adorned in pink velvets, fine fabrics, and aesthetic little cakes. A big fan? Rapper and Martha Stewart’s best friend, Snoop Dogg. He listed it as one of the 11 essentials he carried in his Olympic tote bag, as revealed in an interview with Vogue.
