Charli XCX has shared a new remix of her recent single “360,” bringing along the Swedish phenoms Robyn and Yung Lean. Check it out below.
“360,” the fourth single from Brat, follows “Von Dutch,” “Club Classics,” and “B2B.” The song came with a video uniting a committee of “hot internet girls,” Julia Fox, Chloë Sevigny, Rachel Sennott, and Hari Nef among them. The new album arrives on June 7. Charli XCX has also announced a fall tour with Troye Sivan.
Last month, Yung Lean released his first collaborative LP with Bladee, Psykos. Robyn most recently released Honey in 2018.
