The duo covered the song at the Oxfordshire festival on Saturday
Wet Leg brought Brat summer to Truck Festival 2024 with a cover of Charli XCX‘s ‘360’.
During their headline set on Saturday night (July 27), the indie duo surprised the 25,000 strong crowd in Oxfordshire by launching into a rendition of the hit song, albeit to mixed reviews.
“I love her take of the song,” wrote one fan, “but she’s not giving”. Another compared it to “drunk karaoke”. Others were content enough with the nod to XCX, whose ‘Brat summer’ concept has overtaken pop culture of late.

As was explained in NME’s full timeline of ‘Brat summer‘: “The ‘Brat’ era got off to a massive start in February when Charli XCX shared a snippet of ‘Von Dutch’ on TikTok. Understandably, the reaction to it was huge, proving that the star wasn’t misguided in her insistence that she was “your number one” and “cult classic, but I still pop”.
“An Addison Rae remix built on that fervour before, in May, Charli added to her catchphrase-coining catalogue with ‘360’ and it’s lines “I’m so Julia” and “bumpin’ that”.
The ‘Brat summer’ catch-all has been referenced and riffed on by everyone from Jarvis Cocker, Kyle MacLachlan and Kamala Harris, whose social media accounts launched a new Twitter banner in the style of the lime green ‘Brat’ artwork – which meant CNN found itself having to explain the ‘Brat Summer’ trend to its viewers.
After XCX tweeted “Kamala IS brat”, following Joe Biden endorsing Harris as his successor in the 2024 US presidential race, several music outlets declared Brat summer dead after it became political meme fodder.
However, XCX recently teased new music in response, simply telling fans: “See u next week”
