As for what viewers can expect from the new ceremony format, Dr Jo Twist OBE, CEO of the BPI, home to The Mercury Prize, shared in a press statement: “The Mercury Prize is a cherished part of our cultural landscape, celebrating the art of the album and recognising the exceptional creative achievements of diverse British and Irish artists across the many different genres that make up our thriving and global-facing music scene.
“For the 2024 Mercury Prize, we will work imaginatively with the BBC to deliver a premium programme of music content and digital engagement that will, as ever, benefit all 12 artists in reaching a wider audience, providing an important platform for their evolving career and musical journey.”
DJ, broadcaster and author Annie Macmanus (also known as Annie Mac) and BBC 6 Music presenter Huw Stephens will present at the scaled-back ceremony.
Last year the Mercury Prize was won by Ezra Collective for their album ‘Where I’m Meant To Be’.
Speaking to NME on the day of their nomination, English Teacher frontwoman Lily Fontaine described the honour as as “mental” and called this year’s nominees as “the best year yet. Not just because we’re on it!”
Ghetts also shared that it felt “absolutely amazing” to be up for his second consecutive nomination, while Cat Burns reflected on her album’s recognition by sharing some apt advice for making it through your 20s.
Meanwhile, CMAT used her time speaking to NME on the red carpet to emphasise the need for a “real conversation” about “the industry’s ambivalence towards what’s going on in Gaza at the moment”.
The 2024 Mercury Award Prize ceremony will be filmed and broadcast live from Abbey Road Studios for TV on Thursday September 5 from 8pm until 9.15pm via BBC Four.
