Chappell Roan is facing online backlash after she appeared to 'shade' Charli XCX in a new interview with Rolling Stone.
The Red Wine Supernova singer, 26, spoke candidly about turning down lucrative opportunities that don't 'serve her music' or align with her image.
Specifically, Chappell furiously called out the fast fashion retailer H&M, who recently tapped Charli XCX to be part of their new star-studded ad campaign.
'That's why I am saying no to every f***ing brand deal right now, because I'm like "Does it fit in this world?" No, H&M does not fit in this world. Also, f*** H&M,' she said.
Fans were taken aback by Chappell's remarks, with many accusing her of unfairly taking aim at Charli XCX for agreeing to work with H&M.

'not the charli shade omg…' one X (formerly Twitter) user wrote Tuesday.
Fans of Charli XCX quickly came to her defense by arguing that the singer's campaign made sense because it evoked 'BRAT summer' vibes — a nod to her latest album.
'Charli spent (sic) some very nice words about [Chappell] why is she shading so much I don’t get it,' a disappointed fan wrote.
They were referring to a recent interview where Charli XCX called Chappell's music 'obviously God tier.' 
Most were shocked to see Chappell exhibit such 'rage' over the thought of a fast fashion collaboration while others praised her for putting her foot down. 
'Thank u finally an artist not doing a fast fashion collab,' one fan wrote, while another cited several 'ethical reasons' as to why Chappell may be so vocally opposed to H&M.
'It makes sense, the outfits she wears on stage and in album covers could not be sold at an H&M let’s be real,' another X user penned. 
Some found Chappell's fiery comments hypocritical as her music was recently featured in TV commercials for the major department stores Target and Marshalls.
But her devout fans insisted that 'using a song in a commercial vs being the face of a brand is not the same thing.'
They also noted that her music label Island Records 'probably gave Target the rights not Chappell herself so.'
Chappell's first-ever Rolling Stone cover story was unveiled Tuesday, where she voiced her 'frustration' that people are only now beginning to take her seriously as an artist.
The Missouri native made the comments in a cover story for the outlet which was published on Tuesday.
'What's so infuriating is how people are just now taking me seriously,' she expressed. 'Like, "You know what, b***h? I've been doing this s*** and you're just now catching up."'
'Part of me hopes I never have a hit again because then no one will ever expect anything from me again,' the star told Rolling Stone.

But Chappell explained that music is her passion. 'It's my dream job. I never know if it's going to be like this ever again, which is kind of scary.'
However, some fans were once again left unimpressed and jumped to X to share their thoughts, with one penning, 'All she does is complain.'
Another typed, 'I am tired of hearing about this woman all she does is complain,' while one shared, 'Girl, can you enjoy for a sec? You complaining about everything is kinda annoying.'
A social media user wrote, 'Girl are you appreciating your fame or what,' while one added, 'Fame takes time to come baby, calm down.'
'All she does is complain oh my god,' a fan penned, and another shared, 'Can she stop setting herself up.'
Others wrote, 'One thing about her is she's gonna complain about her job,' as well as, 'She should be thankful to her fans instead that she is getting the fame and getting recognized.'
However, some fans came to Chappell's defense on X, with one adding, 'Chappell Roan's frustration is totally understandable. It's tough when your hard work isn't recognized until later.'
'Well, that's the music industry for you-people love to jump on the bandwagon once you're already blowing up,' another penned.
'Chappell Roan has been grinding for years, and now everyone wants to act like they "discovered" her. Classic.'
The star also opened up about dealing with her rapid success following the release of her album The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess - which notably landed the number two spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart.
'I was getting almost a hundred thousand followers a day. At first, I was in severe denial,' Roan admitted.
'They would literally show me some stats and the only thing I could do is say, "No, no, no. It's not like that." I couldn't say, "I am gaining success."'
During her interview with Rolling Stone, she talked about fans and expressed, ' I don't want to be agoraphobic. That's [how] most of my peers [feel]. Every f***ing artist is on this page.'
'Everyone is uncomfortable with fans. Some people just have more patience. I f***ing don't.'
Last month in August, the songstress shared a rant on TikTok as she slammed 'weird' fans.
'I need you to answer questions - just answer my questions for a second. If you saw a random woman on the street, would you yell at her from your car window?' she expressed.
'That's why I am saying no to every f***ing brand deal right now, because I'm like "Does it fit in this world?" No, H&M does not fit in this world. Also, f*** H&M,' she said; Chappell seen in February

'Would you harass her in public? Would you go up to a random lady and say, "Can I take a photo with you?" and she says, "No, what the f***?" And then you get mad at this random lady?'
She continued, 'Would you be offended if she says no to your time - because she has her own time?' the Good Luck, Babe! artist said. 'Would you stalk her family? Would you follow her around? Would you try to dissect her life and bully her online?'
'This is a lady you don't know and she doesn't know you at all. Would you assume that she's a good person, assume she's a bad person? Would you assume everything you read online about her is true?'
'I'm a random b****, you're a random b****. Just think about that for a second, okay?' the performer added in the clip.
Chappell then explained that she refused to accept 'stalking' and 'harassment' as 'normal' behavior from fans.
'I don't care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous, whatever.'
She added, 'I don't care that it's normal. I don't care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, the career field I've chosen.'
'That does not make it okay that doesn't make it normal. That doesn't mean that I want it, that doesn't mean that I like it...'
Roan added that she didn't 'give a f***' if people thought she was 'selfish' if she said 'no for a photo or for your time or for a hug. That's not normal, that's weird.'
And while talking to Interview Magazine last month, she also admitted that she didn't care about being a success in the music industry.
At one point she said, 'Like, my career doesn't mean anything more now that I have a charting album and song. If anything, I'm just like, "F*** you guys for not seeing what actually matters."
'A chart is so fleeting. Everyone leaves the charts. I'm just like, "This is giving valedictorian."'
Chappell added, 'But everyone graduates. The valedictorian doesn't really matter, and that's kind of what I feel like right now. I'm like, "Cool. Maybe I'm valedictorian, but it's weird that we're graduating, and everyone's going to move, so…"'
Elsewhere in the Rolling Stone interview, the singer got candid about her mental health and how therapy has helped her.
'I realized I can't live like this. I can't live being so depressed or feel so lost that I want to kill myself.'

'Part of me hopes I never have a hit again because then no one will ever expect anything from me again,' the star told Rolling Stone; seen in June
'I just got my s*** together…I would not have been able to handle any of this even a year ago today. It would've just been too much.'
Earlier this year, Roan came out publicly that she is gay and told the outlet, 'You don't necessarily have to be out-loud out. You can kind of silently celebrate if you would like.'
'It's like, look, I love being gay. I just don't want to talk about it every second of every day.'
Chappell also briefly discussed a new love interest who is 'completely outside the industry.'
'She's so awesome and so secure in herself and [has told me], "No pressure, we can just be friends if you want."'
Roan said, 'I'm just running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I'm just like, "What? I can't get married!" It is that type of delusion right now.'
