Will the UK be Livin' on a Prayer or grooving to hyperpop beats?
Let's Ride! This week, the Official Albums Chart is hotter than a Bon Jovi concert in July, with the rock legends from New Jersey squaring off against hyperpop queen Charli XCX. 
It’s a clash of the titans as Bon Jovi's Forever goes head-to-head with Charli’s BRAT for that coveted Number 1 spot.

Bon Jovi, the iconic rock band known for making hearts throb since the '80s, has taken an early lead with their 16th studio album, Forever. 
If they maintain this pace, it will be their sixth UK chart-topper. 
These rock veterans previously rocked the Number 1 spot with classics like 1988’s New Jersey, 1992’s Keep The Faith, 1994’s greatest hits compilation Cross Road, 1995’s These Days, and 2000’s Crush.
But hold onto your leather jackets and Von Dutch caps, because Charli XCX isn't backing down without a fight. 
Her sixth studio album, BRAT, is sitting pretty at Number 2.
The chaotic pop queen sits  fewer than 2,500 chart units behind Bon Jovi. 
And she’s not just sitting idly by; Charli is is putting the pedal to the metal in promotion, pulling out all the stops with an expanded version of BRAT dropping today, featuring three new tracks. 
Could this hyperpop dynamo pull off a last-minute victory? 
Her previous album CRASH did hit Number 1 in 2022, so don't count her out just yet.
As if the battle between Bon Jovi and Charli XCX wasn’t enough, the UK charts are brimming with other contenders. 
In the middle of this musical melee, Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Departments is holding strong in the Top 5. Thanks to her Eras Tour, Swift's back catalogue is also climbing the charts. 
Lover is looking to leap to Number 10, Midnights might jump to Number 16, Reputation is rebounding to Number 17, and folklore could re-enter the Top 20 at Number 20.
Norwegian singer-songwriter AURORA is poised for her best chart position yet with What Happened To The Heart? aiming for Number 5. 
Previously, her 2022 release The Gods We Can Touch peaked at Number 8, so she’s no stranger to the Top 40.
Californian blues musician Seasick Steve is set for a splash with A Trip A Stumble A Fall Down On Your Knees possibly hitting Number 6. 
Meanwhile, Meghan Trainor's Timeless is predicted to claim the Number 7 spot, marking her third Top 10 record.
Making waves in the electronic scene, Berlin-based DJ Peggy Gou is hoping for her first-ever chart entry with I Hear You aiming for Number 12. 
Chappell Roan might see her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, climb into the Top 20 at Number 18.
South London post-punk trio Goat Girl are on course to match their previous peak with Below The Waste targeting Number 24. 
And Tems, the Afrobeats sensation, is eyeing her first Top 40 record with Born In The Wild aiming for Number 28.
Meanwhile, Californian rockers Eels are looking at their highest-charting album in six years with Eels Time! possibly hitting Number 32. 
Haitian-Canadian rapper KAYTRANADA aims to make his third UK Albums Chart appearance with TIMELESS targeting Number 33.
Finally, Bedfordshire’s own Alfie Templeman is in the running for his second Top 40 record with Radiosoul, expected to land at Number 35.
Whether you're a rocker at heart or a hyperpop enthusiast, this week's chart showdown promises to be one for the ages.
