Who’s bringing the poppers?
It’s not a show, it’s a rave — at least, that’s how Charli XCX and Troye Sivan want you to think of Sweat, their upcoming co-headlining tour across North America this fall. After weeks of mysterious teasing that included a billboard at Coachella, the two friends and pop stars have announced they’ll be hitting the road together this fall, turning famous arena stadiums around the country into inimate clubs — or as intimate as you can make New York City’s Madison Square Garden.
It’s a fitting team-up considering the dance floor is a central motif on both singer’s most recent projects. Sivan’s Something To Give Each Other soundtracks the euphoric and tender rise, peak, and fall of a party; while Charli XCX’s upcoming Brat is said to be her rave record, an ode to the “clubs that raised me.” And soon, you’ll be able to shake ass to both in succession.
Read on for everything we know so far about Sweat, including every city they’re playing, who’s opening the tour, and how to buy tickets.

Shygirl is opening the show on all dates as the tour’s special guest. The London-based DJ-producer, and songwriter hosts her own party series Club Shy, which she’s bringing on tour to the U.S. this summer. She most recently released an EP of club-pop tracks under the same name in February, and dropped her debut album, Nymph, in 2022.
