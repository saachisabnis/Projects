THIS IS A POP EMERGENCY
Just when you think Brat summer ended for good, Charli XCX starts teasing you all over again. Something huge happened last night, and whilst it may just be a little cute voice note from a mate Charli XCX posted – everyone thinks a new remix is coming with none other than Dua Lipa on board. No one saw this coming, but if this is true it’s about to cause societal collapse. Here’s what you need to know about the potential Dua Lipa Brat remix, with Charli XCX and Troye Sivan. I’m shaking.
🚨 Dua Lipa x Charli XCX x Troye Sivan is COMING!!!!

Before Brat was really on the radar, Charli XCX set up a private Instagram known as 360_brat where she teased what would become this album era and gave away insights into what was coming. She just posted a little voice note clip on there of Dua Lipa speaking to Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, speaking in Spanish. Dua says “Charli, Troye, un besito para ti mwah,” which translates to “a little kiss for you, mwah”.
i think that dua and charli’s friendship needs 2 be talked about more, they were both huge parts of each others career journey and have stayed tight since. those are my girls right there https://t.co/G3QwX6xKoc

This has of course sent the internet into a frenzy by people taking this as proof that a collab is coming between Charli XCX, Troye Sivan and Dua Lipa.
It’s not even that much of a reach to assume it’s coming. Charli XCX and Troye Sivan are just about to begin their joint SWEAT tour in America – so it makes sense that the two might release a collab to perform together alongside the other few they have. The choice of Dua to speak in Spanish has everyone theorising that the song might be a remix of Brat track Talk Talk – where Charli says “talk to me in French, talk to me in Spanish, talk to me in your own made-up language” during the outro.
I NEED IT NOW.
