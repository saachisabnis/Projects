Dionne Warwick knows the apple is rotten right to the core. The musical legend gave her two cents on the viral “Apple” dance video from night two of Charli XCX and Troye Sivan’s Sweat Tour in Los Angeles. For those not as informed as Warwick, there is a now-iconic audience dance segment of “Apple,” where hotties in the crowd are chosen to do the viral “Apple dance.” There’s been some flubs at past stops, but this time, a man in a black shirt aggressively shimmys his way into the frame, shoving influencer and podcaster Brittany Broski out of way. Warwick will tolerate a lot, but not that. “Now this is just crazy. Security!” Warwick shared on X after seeing the clip. Since the concert, Charli XCX has been reminding her fans to play nice with each other during the segment of the show. “You don’t want to be like that guy in L.A. on the internet,” Charli half-joked in San Francisco Sunday night. It seems like Warwick didn’t need to call for security anyhow; in San Diego, it looked like the Apple cuties were protected by security this time so no one else could ruin their time in the spotlight. Maybe it’s Warwick’s turn to split the apple down symmetrical lines.
Now this is just crazy. Security! https://t.co/V5HCwOKfEy
