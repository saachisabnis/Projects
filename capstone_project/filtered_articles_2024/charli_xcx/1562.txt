Charli XCX isn’t done revamping songs from her smash Brat album just yet. Just days after releasing her first-ever remix album Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat, the British singer-songwriter has released a remix of her track “Spring Breakers” with pop star Kesha.
“Spring Breakers” was first released back in June as part of the deluxe edition of the album, Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not. The new remix was promptly added to the tracklist for Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat on streaming services upon its release today.
“These b***hes rip off / Wish they could be OG, but they not / We going psycho, we going off / Yeah, me and Charli, we the party girl gods,” Kesha sings on the track. Given fans met Kesha more than a decade ago through party-centric hits like “Tik Tok” and “Blow,” it’s only fitting to have her on the “Spring Breakers” remix.
Kesha is in the midst of her own musical resurgence with her own record label and new album on the way, so the timing of the “Spring Breakers” remix couldn’t be better to help build momentum. Back in July, she released “Joyride” as the lead single from her forthcoming sixth studio album likely due out in 2025.
“I’ve never felt happier, more excited, more at peace and had such a purpose in my entire life. And I feel like I have earned the right to be this happy for sure,” Kesha told V magazine back in February of her life and career today. “I am loving every minute of what feels like a brand-new and very exciting chapter.”
Charli XCX and Troye Sivan’s joint Sweat Tour continues tonight in Phoenix and wraps up Oct. 23 in Seattle.
