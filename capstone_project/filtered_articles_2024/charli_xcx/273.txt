Several members of Hollywood and the music industry are pledging their support for Vice President Kamala Harris‘ presidential ticket in the 2024 election. Celebrities from Charli XCX and Barbra Streisand to Sheryl Lee Ralph and Kerry Washington shared their Harris endorsements on social media after President Joe Biden announced that he would not be seeking reelection.  

	On Aug. 5, actress and fierce environmentalist Jane Fonda shared her official Harris endorsement, saying she was voting for the Vice President “not just because Donald Trump would be a total disaster for our democracy and our planet, but because she’s the right person for the job.”

	“When you’re my age, you have the privilege of looking back and remembering when some great tectonic shift rearranged the pieces of your life — changing your story, and maybe even the planet’s story, forever,” she said. “We’re living through one of those moments. Everything is on the line.”

	Harris ended the month of July with two major celebrity endorsements at a rally in Atlanta: the VP brought out Quavo for a speech on gun safety and Megan Thee Stallion for a rap performance.

	










	After clips of Harris to the beat of Charli XCX’s album Brat went viral the weekend of her announcement, the singer wrote on X, “Kamala IS brat” on X. Harris’ X account then followed Charli on the platform. 

	For her part, Barbra Streisand shared her “love” for Biden, before adding that Harris would “continue Joe Biden’s work and will be a great president.” She added, “Trump is a pathological liar who lies as easily as he breathes. He wants to take away women’s rights and destroy our great democracy.”
I love Joe Biden, and all the wonderful things he’s done for our country. Trump is a pathological liar who lies as easily as he breathes. He wants to take away women’s rights and destroy our great democracy. Kamala Harris will continue Joe Biden’s work and will be a great…

Cardi B shared her excitement on Instagram saying she always thought Harris “should’ve been the 2024 candidate.” She wrote: “Stop playing wit me!!” Lil Nas X wrote simply, “Lock in lil bro @KamalaHarris!”

	Mark Hamill wrote in a post on X that President Biden “has a record of accomplishments unmatched by any president in our lifetime.

	Mark Ruffalo shared Biden’s announcement, telling his fellow Democrats, “Now we have our marching orders and time to hit the trail running.” He reposted a video of Harris on X, writing, “Trump is too old and of terrible personal character to be President. He just can’t be trusted or relied on and he is always falling asleep on the job. We need a young President who isn’t a convicted criminal to be President.”

	Yvette Nicole Brown shared a series of posts on social media pledging her support for Harris. “I’m sure it goes without saying but I FULLY stand with (and next to 😜) my Soror, the fabulous @KamalaHarris !

	Many Hollywood Democrats have remained publicly silent regarding the 2024 election, hesitant to support Biden’s bid for reelection. When there wasn’t much excitement around his candidacy, certain players in the industry still supported the current president’s campaign; they emphasized the importance of voting for Biden’s administration and rallying around issues he supported. But after the first disastrous presidential debate on June 27, many in the industry began to express their concerns about the likelihood of Trump beating Biden in November.

	Even Biden’s biggest donors and longtime advocates spoke out against him. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was one of the first major donors to speak out publicly, telling the New York Times on July 3, “Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous.” Then on July 10, George Clooney published an op-ed in the New York Times calling for Biden to rescind his campaign for presidency.

	Sigourney Weaver spoke out in support of Harris at the Venice Film Festival, where she was in attendance to receive the Golden Lion Lifetime Achievement Award. When a reporter asked Weaver about how her roles as an actress, specifically playing Ellen Ripley’s character in the science fiction classic Alien films, could help make it possible for Harris to be elected president, she said, “We’re all so excited about Kamala and to think for one moment that my work would have anything to do with her rise makes me very happy.

	










	Weaver teared up and continued, “It’s true, I have so many women who come and thank me…It’s been difficult since 2016, and we’re all very grateful about her.”
