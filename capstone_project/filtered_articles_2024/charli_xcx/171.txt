Paul Heaton is on track to land his first solo No. 1 on the U.K. Official Albums Chart this week with The Mighty Several (EMI).

	Known for his work with The Beautiful South and The Housemartins, Heaton has charted three No. 1 albums on the U.K. Official Albums Chart twice with former Beautiful South bandmate Jacqui Abbott, but never reached the top spot on his own—but all that could change come Friday.

	With The Mighty Several making its debut, Heaton’s long-established fan base is giving the album strong momentum, positioning him for his first solo chart-topping album, according to the latest Chart blast.

	Standing in Heaton’s way, however, is none other than Charli XCX, who rockets up the charts this week with her remix album Brat, But Not Really Brat (Atlantic), moving from No. 16 to No. 2. The album, which features collaborations with Ariana Grande, The 1975, and Shygirl, is set to give Heaton some serious competition.
