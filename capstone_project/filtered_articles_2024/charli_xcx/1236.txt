Ladies, For once it's good to be a 'brat'.
With the release of Charli XCX's insanely successful new party album, "Brat," Gen Z is gearing up for a crazy "brat summer." The phrase 'brat' is trending on tiktok as a search for “brat summer” yields thousands of posts, with self-proclaimed “brats” explaining what the term means.
For many, it represents a kind of recklessness, grittiness and supreme self-confidence the complete polar opposite of last year’s “clean girl” aesthetic, which was categorized by sleek minimalism, neutral colors and a kind of preppy look to it.
Others have describe “brat summer” as sleeping in last night’s makeup, stumbling through the front door at 2 a.m. after a night of clubbing or getting some spontaneous ink some diehard brats have even been branded with the “brat” album art as a lower back tattoo.
When asked about what she believes a “brat summer” is, Charli XCX described the attitude and aesthetic as “trashy, A pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a scrappy white top with no bra,”
“Brat summer” has a signature color as well the distinct acid green that’s the same shade as the cover of the Charli XCX album. 
It's important to note you don’t need to be a cool girl or a clubber to be a “brat,” so enjoy your unhinged bratz summer!
