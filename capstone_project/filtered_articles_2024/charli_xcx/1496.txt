You could be standing next to Chappell Roan anywhere and not know it, because she is GREAT at disguises! The singer/songwriter went to Charli XCX and Troye Sivan's "Sweat Tour" in Los Angeles this week ... under cover!
Chappell attended Charli and Troye's LA concert with her creative director, Ramisha "Misha" Sattar. A video posted to Sattar's Instagram stories shows Chappell dancing along to the show as the camera pans over to her, rocking a black wig to hide her signature red, freaking out over the concert (as one does).
Clearly celebrating #bratautumn:
In a recent interview with NME, Chappell explained how she was excited to see Charli XCX and Troye Sivan's tour, and told the outlet, "I love Charli so much. She was like the first girl to reach out and check on me. She was like ‘Hi, this is about to get really hard and if you need a friend, I’ll be here for you’. So it’s just so sick to see her just ruling the f***ing world and doing it her way." She added, "I think so many people have tried to put her in a pop box of like 'she’s a pop star' and like she is but she’s like a club girl and is fully living. She’s fueling the fantasy and it’s working because it’s her and it’s so inspiring to me. She’s just, I am so proud of her for Brat and I can’t wait to see her and Troye’s show."
