Get ready to tie the knot with me! l I’m hosting a wedding dance party!!!

	 

expect: A super long DJ set from me. A real wedding arch and a bouquet toss. And a night of non stop dancing to my all-time favorite songs—from Charli xcx, SOPHIE, Kesha, ABBA, 100 gecs, Caroline Polachek, Mura Masa, and Black Eyed Peas

And I'll be making my official live debut with a Justin Abisror performance! slay!!

	 

Each ticket purchase gets a ring pop at the door. Dress for the occasion. This is a special life event!! Also, no alcohol in the building so if that’s what you had in mind, don’t come.

	 

See you on the dance floor!
