If the Victoria’s Secret fashion show returning in 2024 wasn’t a sure-enough sign that sexy, barely-there looks were back, we can confirm that it isn’t just models on the runways embracing the trend, but all of the year’s it girls, too—including Kendall Jenner, Charli XCX, and Greta Lee, to name a few.
Off the runways, the streets went sheer at many of the year’s red carpet events, from the 2024 Met Gala to the Grammy Awards. Stars like Lee and Elle Fanning took to the carpet in see-through gowns from the likes of Loewe and Balmain. And for some, they even tried the trend off the carpet. (See: Anne Hathaway and Hailey Bieber, who chose to go about their usual New York City activities in gauzy and skin-tight dresses and catsuits.)
Those who didn’t want to go the sheer route—like Rihanna, Lisa, Tyla, and Addison Rae—instead opted for lingerie-like looks, taking their negligees from the bedrooms to the streets. Scroll through for our favorite barely-there looks of 2024.
