A clip of Charli XCX, our Mercury quiz, and is the shortlist any good?
Words by Loud And Quiet
Following on from last week’s Mercury Prize predictions episode, Greg and Stu dive into this year’s shortlist to see how wrong they were as they cast judgement on which of the nominated records they think might actually have a chance of winning this year’s award.
Stu picks out a clip from our 2018 Charli XCX episode, and you’ll all invited to play our Mercury Prize audio quiz, safe in the knowledge that you’ll more probably be better at it than Greg was.
