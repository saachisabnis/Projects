Once again, Duolingo has delivered a marketing masterclass by participating in a pop culture phenomenon that many have labeled the trend of the summer.
The language-learning app’s mascot was present at the opening night of the Sweat Tour, a co-headlining tour by British singer Charli XCX and Australian star Troye Sivan.
Last Saturday (September 14), Duo showed up to the concert in Detroit, Michigan, wearing a “Brat” shirt, the title of Charli’s album.
By the time the bright green owl was kicked out of the venue, it had already generated buzz online.

In fact, over the past few months, social media users have suggested a connection between the summer album and the viral mascot, noting their similar shade of green and the company’s history of embracing Gen-Z trends.
When the opportunity to collaborate—directly or indirectly—with a massive trend arises, brands are quick to respond.

Explaining what “Brat” means to her,Charli said, “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes. Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like, parties through it, is very honest, very blunt.”
The trend took over TikTok, with hundreds of posts under the hashtag #bratsummer.
The photo of the green bird wearing the “Brat” merch was posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) by PopBase. The brand then re-posted the image, writing, “Talk to me in French, talk to me in Spanish.”
In one of the remixed tracks from Brat, titled “Talk Talk,” Dua Lipa shows off her language skills by singing in French and Spanish.
“Hay una fiesta en mi casa, vengan. Será muy divertido,” the pop star says, translating to, “There is a party at my house, come. It will be very fun.”
In another voice note at the end of the song, Dua, who has previouslycollaborated with Duolingo, says, “J’ai perdu mon téléphone mais tu sais quoi? Ça valait la peine parce que c’était une soirée de fou,” which means, “I lost my phone, but you know what? It was worth it because it was an insane party.”

Inside the venue, concertgoers were in for another surprise. TheAmerican company had arranged for 20 employees to wear Duolingo heads, making the vibrant green owlseasy to spot from anywhere in the Little Caesars Arena.
That included the stage, too. During her performance, Charli gave a shoutout to the flock of birds who were jumping up and down to her electrifying, club-like beats.
“Duolingo right there, baby!” the 32-year-old said, pointing to the energetic crowd members.

The educational tech company shared their accomplishment on social media, generating even more engagement for the brand.
According to several TikTok users,Duolingo employees were also handing out “Brat green” merchandise featuring the company’s mascot before the start of the show.
Previously, the Duolingo TikTok accountposted a video of the iconic bird doing push-ups and other exercises in its “Brat” shirt.
“Training for Sweat Tour so I can fit through the door,” the overlay caption reads. The “bird” further declared, “Brat summer isn’t over until I say so.” (Charli XCX announced that Brat summer was officially over in a post on X.)

Duolingo’s recent posts have amassed millions of views onsocial media, with many users praising thebrand for tapping into pop culture with its amusing ideas.
“Duolingo’s marketing team deserves a raise,” one fan said.
“Duolingo really is the original creator of Brat green, huh,” another commented.
“Duolingo at a Charli XCX and Troye Sivan concert? That’s so random but kinda cool,” wrote a third user.
“The owl really knows how to stay on trend. Wonder what languages it’s learning at the concert,” a separate individual added.

Zaria Parvez, the company’s Senior Global Social Media Manager, celebrated the achievement on LinkedIn.
“With millions of impressions in UGC [user-generated content], a mention by Pop Base, and a feature from the official SWEAT tour – I think it’s safe to say this was a huge success,”she wrote.

According toKeyhole, Duolingo targets an audience that wants to learn a new language but doesn’t have the means to afford regular language courses. This includes Gen Z and millennials in the age group of 16 to 34.  
To appeal to their target audience, they gamify the learning process and invest in creating a playful social media presence, using informal language—their TikTok bio is “just an owl tryna vibe”—references to memes, and young celebrities. 
Last year, they jumped on the Barbie trend byposting an edit of Duo in BarbieLand in a blonde wig and a pink cowgirl outfit, saying hello to Ryan Gosling and twerking on the pink carpet.

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.
