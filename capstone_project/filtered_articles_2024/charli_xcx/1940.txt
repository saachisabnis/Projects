Charli xcx created her own version of Ariana Grande's iconic "Domingo" sketch on the latest episode of Saturday Night Live on Saturday (November 16). 
The Brat icon not only hosted the beloved comedy show for the first time ever (explaining what it really means to be "brat"), but she also took part in a handful of sketches and performed live to close out an unforgettable night of talent. One of the most memorable sketches of the evening was the "Babymoon" sketch which closely resembled Grande's "Bridesmaid Speech" (from a previous episode) turned "Bestie Babymoon." 
In the sketch, Charli and friends gifted the mother-to-be a song for her baby shower, revealing more than expected. The slightly off-tune message, paired with Chappell Roan's "Hot To Go," was cleverly titled "D-O-M-I-N-G-O" as the skit took fans on a rollercoaster ride through a twin pregnancy in which each child belonged to a different dad. 
The end of the sketch sees both fathers at the baby shower as the bridesmaids finish telling the story of their unbelievable bestie babymoon excursion in Miami. After debuting her exceptional hosting and acting skills, the "Guess" hitmaker took the stage to perform "Sympathy is a knife," bringing down the house with an epic SNL party in only a way Charli xcx could!
