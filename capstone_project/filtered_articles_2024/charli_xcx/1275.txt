Fresh off her recent Boiler Room DJ set at a Brooklyn warehouse last weekend, British singer Charli XCX is moving full steam ahead with her sixth studio album Brat, due out this summer. And while warmer weather might still be a ways away, the singer is giving fans a taste of what to expect with “Von Dutch,” the album’s lead single out now.
Charli recruited frequent collaborator Easyfun, who most recently worked with her on her Barbie soundtrack hit “Speed Drive,” to produce “Von Dutch.” The two previously joined forces on the songs “Femmebot” and “Backseat” from her 2017 mixtape Pop 2. On “Von Dutch,” Charli is in familiar territory as she celebrates having a good time over an electropop beat. “I'm just living that life Von Dutch / Cult classic, but I still pop / I get money, you get mad because the bank’s shut,” she sings.
Charli shows her perception of the “Von Dutch” lifestyle in the song’s music video. It begins with her escaping a swarm of paparazzi hounding her with microphones as she enters Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport. She’s chased onto an airplane and dances around the cabin before running out onto the tarmac and climbing onto the plane’s wing. Bloodied by the end, Charli lays on the baggage claim conveyer belt, remaining still on the carousel as the credits roll.
When thinking about her forthcoming era, the Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree explained to fans on social media just how much the LP means to her and how it’s a natural progression of her sound given her history. “I was born to make dance music. I came from the clubs,” she said. “[Brat] is the album I’ve always wanted to make.”
“[Brat] is a club record and I can’t wait to party around the world with you all,” she added.
