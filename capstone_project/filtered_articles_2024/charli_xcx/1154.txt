Don’t believe everything you see. Justin Timberlake is currently a hot topic after his DWI, and the internet is having fun teasing him about it. One particular post became super viral after people believed that a satirical account reported that the “Can’t Stop The Feeling!” singer had many drugs in his system at the time of his arrest.
Pop Crave parody account @poo_crave posted on X, “Justin Timberlake allegedly had traces of molly, poppers, Truvada, and coke in his bloodstream following his DWI arrest in New York.” Unfortunately as of writing this article, the @poo_crave account has been banned from X and the tweet was subsequently deleted. A community note was added to the post, “This is a satire [account]. According to JT’s lawyer, ‘The charge was a single count because he refused the breath test.'” Shockingly, the post ended up having over 28 million views with some users believing it was true.

The post spread to different social media platforms.

Justin Timberlake failed field sobriety tests and was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving on June 17, 2024. The singer was arraigned in the Hamptons, New York, and was released without having to post bail. He’s ordered to appear in court on July 26. 
A source told Page Six that the Sag Harbor Police Department cop who pulled him over was “so young that he didn’t even know” who the *NSYNC member was.
“He didn’t recognize him or his name,” the insider said. Another insider told the site about what exactly went down between the two, “Justin said under his breath, ‘This is going to ruin the tour.’ The cop replied, ‘What tour?’ Justin said, ‘The world tour.’” Timberlake is on a short break for The Forget Tomorrow World Tour which starts back up again on June 21 in Chicago.
