The Ella Purnell show is packed full of pop bangers, from Billie Eilish and Charli XCX to Sugababes and the Spice Girls
The new Sky Atlantic dark comedy Sweetpea is making headlines, but what songs feature on the show’s soundtrack? Read on for the full list.
All six episodes of the series are streaming on the platform and NOW TV in the UK as of Thursday (October 10), and it is available to watch on Starz in the United States and Canada.
The show has been created by Kirstie Swain and is based on the series of novels of the same name by CJ Skuse, the first of which was published in 2017.
Sweetpea stars Ella Purnell (Fallout, Yellowjackets) as Rhiannon, an admin assistant at a local newspaper who appears unassuming, but is hiding a rampantly murderous private life. Nicole Lecky, Jon Pointing and Ingrid Oliver co-star.
The show features an original score by Isobel Waller-Bridge (Fleabag, Emma), who also co-wrote the opening theme ‘Do You See Me Now’ with Chinchilla, who also sings the song.
