Newly Announced Keynotes:
• Privacy-in-Progress: Redefining the Boundaries of Being Online: For too long, we've accepted a world where tech companies go unchecked collecting, monitoring, and profiting from our personal information and activities. Then when that data is mishandled or used against us, we alone suffer the devastating consequences to our emotional well-being, financial security, or physical safety. While it can feel like this is just the price we pay to be online, as humans we deserve better, and as technologists we have the power to do better. In this Keynote Session, founder and CEO of Block Party and co-founder of Project Include Tracy Chou and Head of Product Design at Block Party Deonne Castaneda share where we are now and what more we can do to shape a privacy-forward, safer Internet together.
• Death of the Follower & the Future of Creativity on the Web: The internet started as a platform that democratized creative distribution. You could upload your work to platforms like YouTube and immediately have it accessible to millions of people. After that came the "subscribe" button, which enabled creators to go beyond reach, build a following, and find their true fans that would support them to build a creative business. But with the rise of platform-focused algorithms (Facebook's ranking, TikTok's "for you" curation), creators cannot reach their following and true fans. This shift has had a devastating impact on creators' creativity and ability to support themselves doing what they love. In this Keynote Session, co-founder and CEO of Patreon Jack Conte will explain how the current internet algorithms are killing the traditional "follower" for creators, threatening their creative freedom and livelihoods; and advocate for the new spaces on the internet (like Patreon) where creators can always connect with their communities, create what they want, and control their own destinies.
Newly Announced Featured Speakers:
• Vice President of Product Management of Smart Glasses at Meta Li-Chen Miller
Newly Announced Featured Sessions:
• The Artist Creative Process: It’s easy to appreciate a work of art solely based on the final product, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Behind a finished song or album is a trail of blood, sweat, and tears that were sacrificed, all for the sake of creating something that tells a story or leaves a lasting impact. The journey to this creation is different for everyone, as every artist has their own creative process and journey in how they approach their art. In this session, join singer, songwriter, orator, model, actress, visual artist, entrepreneur, and activist Kam Franklin, blues musician Buffalo Nichols, singer, songwriter, and guitarist Jackie Venson, and moderator, emcee, television reporter, Writer-at-Large at Texas Monthly and Host of the National Podcast of Texas Andy Langer for a conversation about the artist creative process and how each artist approaches their process in creating music.

• Technology, Leadership, Geopolitics and the Future: Growing up, our teachers emphasized the need to learn math by saying we would not always have a calculator in our pocket. Today, not only do we all have calculators, but cameras, emails, travel apps, instantaneous news, dating apps, and other social networks right at our fingertips.
