Selena Gomez is feeling the love like never before amid her romance with Benny Blanco.
The 32-year-old Rare Beauty founder opened up about her relationship with the 36-year-old music producer in a new cover story with Vanity Fair and how it's different than any other past romance she has experienced before. 
"I've never been loved this way," she said. "He's just been a light. A complete light in my life. He's my best friend. I love telling him everything."
Gomez and Blanco have known each other for years and have even collaborated in the past, but it wasn't until last year that they struck up a romance, per People. The "Love On" singer confirmed their relationship in December 2023, gushing that her boyfriend is "my absolute everything in my heart," and the pair have continue to publicly support each other and share their love with the world, with Blanco even opening up about the "next goal" he anticipates with Gomez.
"We always make sure we're protecting what we have, but there's no rules. I want him to always be himself. I always want to be myself," she said, adding that she would want to continue that pattern even if they were to get married in the future by keeping her name. "I'm not changing my name no matter what. I am Selena Gomez. That's it."
Elsewhere in the interview, the Only Murders in the Building star shared a vulnerable look into what her future family may look like as she revealed that she "can't carry" children on her own due to "medical issues."
"I haven't ever said this, but I unfortunately can't carry my own children," she said. "I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby's in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while."
