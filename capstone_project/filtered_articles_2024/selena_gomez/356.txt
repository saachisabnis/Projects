Selena Gomez must be hard at work on the Wizards of Waverly Place reboot because her boyfriend, Benny Blanco, just shared a cheeky throwback to her character on the show. In a snapshot shared via Blanco's Instagram Stories, the music producer can be seen holding a signed headshot of a young Gomez in character as Alex Russo while present-tense Gomez stands in the background, looking embarrassed.
It's hard to tell whether grown-up Gomez is in costume and therefore impossible to say that the image was taken on the set of the forthcoming Wizards reboot. But her bangs, lilac manicure, and geometric rings make a strong case for the possibility.
I've been shouting it from the rooftops for more than a year now. We have the indie-sleaze revival to thank for bringing icons like Zooey Deschanel, Sky Ferreira, and Avril Lavigne back into the zeitgeist. But the return of the indie-sleaze It girl simply wouldn't be complete without scene kid Selena Gomez and her streaky highlights. Gomez was Disney’s resident hipster when the trend was at its height, and she had the pop punk band and edgy cuff bracelets to prove it.
Just the other day Selena Gomez and her new bangs were giving serious Alex Russo vibes at the premiere of Lola, her bestie Nicola Peltz-Beckham's new movie. The Rare Beauty mogul sported similarly wispy bangs when she portrayed the young moody witch in the second season of the Disney Channel original series, which aired from 2007 to 2012.
