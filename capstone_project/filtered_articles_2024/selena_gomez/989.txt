Stumbled across Only Murders in the Building Emmy FYC booklet that Hulu’s sending out to voters and it’s interesting that they’ve only submitted one episode to both Writing (Opening Night) and Directing (The Show Must…) when they over submitted in Directing last year. Also interesting that they’ve submitted Ashley Park and Jesse Williams, but not Linda Emond and Wesley Taylor who both had much more substantial roles, granted, they weren’t ever getting in, but it’s still interesting. And it’s kind of confusing that they haven’t submitted Look For The Light in Original Music but instead chose to submit Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It? even though the former song went viral and was a substantial moment in the season. Interesting, interesting choices.

I thought they’d submit Opening Night to both categories, or the submissions would be the other way around so that they could submit Jamie Babbit for the one episode she directed, so it genuinely surprised me when I realised they’d snubbed her for the submission, but then they probably realised where they went wrong with the over submissions in Directing last year.

Since there has been talk of Young Sheldon on here recently thanks it’s appearance on Netflix, there is currently fan edit going viral on TikTok at the moment (5.4 million likes, 25 million views). Granted there could be hundreds of those going around that just never made its way to my algorithm/feed but I don’t recall it being this popular before on such a youth skewing app
This is one of the reasons I’ve been a bit higher on it than some – it’s come across my TikTok algorithm quite a bit however I’m not in the US and it’s been airing on Netflix overseas for a while. There is a definite family audience for this.
I also think this something that makes more sense if you have kid around you and realise there isn’t the feed-in there once was from Disney and Nickelodeon (which in Nickelodeon’s case is probably a good thing given recent documentaries) that it this point stretches back in nominees legacy as far back as Kenan Thompson, who’s 45 – plus there’s no more Modern Family etc. There’s also barely any high school shows or CW shows.
This is one of the very, very, very few shows on TV with kids at this point. It’s an anomaly. Kids want to watch kids. If you look at Raegen Revord on IMDBPro (as well as McKenna Grace, who has guested on this and has already been a guest nominee), they are sky-high – considerably higher than Zendaya and Ortega at the same age. They have zero competition in their age group. The same also more or less true for Armitage.  Half the reason kids are watching endless YouTube I suspect is because they don’t have anyone their age to watch.
I mean I get it, Hoffman is the showrunner. But Babbit has directed more episodes of OMITB than he has in his entire career and is an actual past nominee for the show with the stronger submission on paper. Not exactly a good move from them. It’s not like their support with directors is big when DGA never nominated them and they were snubbed just last year at the Emmys. The directing branch is also someone with a well-documented bias for known and established directors.
A Negroni. Sbagliato. With Prosecco in it.
I feel like OMITB have always been a bit hmmm in submissions and campaigning, you could see it on the acting side beyond the leads last year. They were never overly in to pushing Da’Vine over someone more flashy and I never really got why they didn’t push Houdyshell last season who whilst not the biggest star in the world had a perfect submission episode and was likely to be popular with the same sort of demo as, say, the people who voted for Lane  (admittedly, that category was stacked).
They also really didn’t campaign Selena at all last year – I know she’s famous as hell and hardly needs an overall profile boost but there’s something to be said for a more targeted approach.
Houdyshell was not eligible for guest and as great as she was, she wasn’t getting in in a stacked supporting lineup no matter how hard they pushed her so I don’t think that was a bad decision, just a bad situation for them because of ineffectual rules.

That’s been my main annoyance about Hulu’s campaigning for OMITB, because they very clearly threw season 2 under the bus to make way for Handmaid’s S5, only for that to be DOA, but then they didn’t do much campaigning on behalf of the trio when they weren’t able to. It’s very obvious, however, that this year OMITB is Hulu’s main priority given that they’re directly targeting voters with their submissions and excerpts praising their main acting submissions; they also probably know that this is their best chance on getting Selena an individual acting nomination which is why I’m also hoping she campaigns herself this year too. The show feels locked in many categories, but given the right push, which I am optimistic about, it could surpass S1’s 17 nominations haul.

I know but I don’t mean hardcore campaigning, I mean I don’t think her name was even on their FYC stuff to alert people she was supporting.
Aside from that, I do wonder if maybe the overall Disney/FX/Hulu/ABC strategy comes in to play with OMITB/Abbott/The Bear though – like they don’t really want to cancel each other out?
but then they didn’t do much campaigning on behalf of the trio when they weren’t able to
Yeah, Selena aside, they hugely under-campaigned Steve last year in my opinion, I tend to think Segel’s campaigning is what got him over the line (this isn’t a criticism of either performance, I enjoyed both). I think they assumed he was locked when he wasn’t. It’s why I’ve said I really wouldn’t overthink Selena too much given they totally underplayed Steve’s FYC.
That said last years campaigning was the most in person skewed I can remember, especially in competitive categories, in a way I thought was kind of unsustainable (both as a time hog and from a $$$ perspective) and I don’t think will be replicated this year post strike.
I feel like Only Murders in the Building has a problem campaigning its actors in general. Part of the reason why Martin ended up getting snubbed last year was because the novelty around him making entering the foray of television for the first time in decades with a show he co-created had faded and the consensus of which of the two leading men gave the stronger performance shifted further in Short’s direction (arguably something similar happened two years ago with Aniston/Witherspoon). But prior to that in spite of strong notices and being an Oscar nominated actor they couldn’t really manage to get the wheels rolling on a campaign for Amy Ryan in spite of there being room in that category that year for her. Furthermore they’ve still not been able to get Fey in for either season of the show in spite of her being a perennial nominee in that comedy guest actress category, failed to get the wheels rolling on a Shirley Maclaine campaign last year and couldn’t manage to net Jane Lynch a win in spite of the buzz her performance in season 1 received and the fact that she was the only person in her category that year who had no internal competition. They do seem to have stepped up this year in highlighting all four of Gomez, Martin, Short and Streep but I think this is partly why, as deserving as he is, I’ve left out Rudd from my predictions in the supporting actor category in spite of it being a weak field. He’s much more of a guest than Streep is, he has never received a major industry nomination before and his buzz pales in comparison to the rest of the ensemble’s all in spite of him being a major Hollywood A lister doing great work.

Give Meg Ryan the Oscar vehicle she deserves!
I’m not familiar with Luminate (I understand they’re new?), but they released the list of most watched movies and series on streaming from March 22nd to 28th. Palm Royale is one of only two non-Netflix series to make the Top 10, coming in fifth place (and The Gentlemen in third).

It wouldn’t surprise me if those minutes were reflected in the Nielsen charts. Masters of the Air charted and Palm Royale knocked it off of number one on Apple’s charts as soon as it debuted.

it’s basically Nielsen Music (which gives data to Billboard Music), after being bought out.
Luminate have been around for a while, jjjmoss is right re the Nielsen Music but they have a TV section which functions a little like IMDBPro and  I am inclined to think the data is probably legit because even on the lower tier for the TV and film membership anyone can sign up for they have +3, +7 etc data for all the network and cable shows. They are under Penske like GD and the trades I believe.
