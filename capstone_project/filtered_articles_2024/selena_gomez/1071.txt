I am SO shocked
As of yesterday, Benny Blanco is Selena Gomez’s fiancée and the celebrity reactions to the pair getting engaged have all been overwhelmingly positive. However, like many famous people on the internet, Benny Blanco has a questionable digital footprint. A thread on X has been going viral after somebody compiled a huge list of all his wildest behaviours over the years. Here’s a rundown of all the problematic stuff he’s posted online: Let Benny Blanco’s controversies speak for themselves.

People on X are concerned after watching this disturbing video Benny filmed of his kid and their dog.
In addition to revealing that he doesn't shower every day, Benny Blanco said he has a fetish for tasting human pee:

On the Wild Ride podcast, Benny revealed that one time is friend “pissed” in his mouth. His reaction? “It tastes crazy, but it is so good.” This isn’t exactly a crime but you couldn’t torture this information out of most normal people, never mind give it willingly.

There’s no evidence this is about Selena but it just makes me feel a bit icky.

There’s nothing wrong with being a fan of someone, but Benny Blanco’s obsession with Justin Bieber is kind of wild. They have worked together on songs before so it’s not completely out of nowhere but in case you forgot, Justin is Selena Gomez’s ex, which makes this whole situation very weird indeed.

A user wrote underneath how “uncomfortable” they thought Justin looked during the conversation.

I honestly don’t know what was going through Benny Blanco’s mind when he posted this video of his dog, but shocked doesn’t even cover it for me.
