Selena Gomez found singing in 'Emilia Perez' to be a "therapeutic" experience.
Selena Gomez loved singing in the movie
The 32-year-old actress stars alongside Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofía Gascon in the crime-comedy film, and Selena has revealed that she relished the challenge of singing 'Mi Camino' in the movie.
The brunette beauty - who plays Jessi Del Monte in the film - said at the Telluride Film Festival: "It was actually a totally different song.
"It had a bit more of a rough sound to it and over the course of, you know, working with [singer-songwriter] Camille on the song intimately, it became almost like a ballad.
"It was more of a story about a woman and phases of life that she goes through and it just was beautiful.

"I watched it, I was in the studio for hours and hours and it was just so much fun, but also not trying to sing the way that I would normally sing.

"I had to try and, you know, in my mind to think, ‘Okay, this is what were the limits I could reach within my character.' And it was really therapeutic and I thought it was so beautifully done."

Meanwhile, Selena recently confessed to feeling inspired by Meryl Streep.

The actress worked with Meryl on 'Only Murders in the Building' and Selena recalled being brought to tears by one scene in particular.

Selena - who plays Mabel Mora on the TV show - told The Hollywood Reporter: "My favourite moment was watching Meryl sing onstage. That was chilling, and she would do it acappella, live every time, and I cried. 

"I wasn’t in the scene, but I was there sitting in the audience, and I was completely moved and was brought to tears. Just the way she commits to her craft in every way is remarkable. It was beautiful."
