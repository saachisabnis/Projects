Selena Gomez thinks showing vulnerability is "one of the strongest things you can do".
Selena Gomez released her documentary in 2022
The 32-year-old star shared her struggles with the world in her 2022 documentary film 'Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me', and the brunette beauty has now admitted that she felt a little nervous about releasing the project.
Selena - who opened up about her physical and mental health in the film - told 'CBS Sunday Morning': "Once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. 
"But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing."
In 2022, Selena launched the Rare Impact Fund, a charity that helps young people who suffer from mental health issues. And Selena has now described the project as the "cherry on top of everything".

The actress said: "This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family. This is the cherry on top of everything."

Selena achieved billionaire status earlier this year, and she recently admitted that she feels "really proud" of her success.

Selena doesn't feel fame and success has changed her at all, but she's still proud of everything she's achieved in her career.

Asked about her billionaire status, Selena told The Hollywood Reporter: "I don’t really pay much attention. 

"I don’t think anything about me has changed. I don’t think that I feel different. I think I’m just really proud. And also, personally, I just don’t think it’s anyone’s business."
