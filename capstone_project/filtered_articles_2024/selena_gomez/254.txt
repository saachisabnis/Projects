We're just over a week into Women's History Month, and today, March 8, 2024 is International Women's Day. This marks the perfect time to learn about the powerful women who blazed trails and broke through glass ceilings to build a better world for all of us.
Though huge strides have been made, we still have quite a ways to go before we achieve equality between the sexes. This disparity is still very apparent in the film industry. For example, in the history of the Academy Awards — which will air its 96th ceremony on Sunday, March 10 — only eight women have been nominated for Best Director, and only three women have won. But the fight for representation continues daily, and one of the best ways you can help is by supporting women-led films. This can be as easy as popping some popcorn, plopping on the couch and streaming an excellent movie or two. 
If you're not sure where to start in your streaming, we're here to help. In honor of the groundbreaking women of history and film, we've rounded up a preliminary list of our favorite female-led and -created movies and documentaries. From eye-opening documentaries about some of the world's most inspiring women to fictional accounts of badass women who fight the status quo, our list is wide and varied. Stream everything from historical dramas about the women who helped us land on the moon to a documentary about Gloria Steinem and everything in between.
Ahead, load up your queue with all these powerful movies and documentaries for International Women's Day today.
