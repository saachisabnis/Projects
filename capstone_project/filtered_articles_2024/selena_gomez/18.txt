The gasp I exhaled 
Right, there are few things I look forward to than People’s sexiest man alive award, although they don’t always hit the nail on the head. This year has become particularly fraught as X has become filled with concern over the fact that Benny Blanco has been crowned People’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2024.
But let’s get to the bottom of this because all might not be what it seems, so let’s debunk whether Benny Blanco has actually been voted People’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2024.
Straight off the gate this rumour obviously came from X, as all celebrity rumours tend to with people saying: “Benny Blanco is People’s sexiest man alive??? Y’all I need 2024 to be over right now.” Another added: “Wydm Benny Blanco as the sexiest man alive???”
Benny Blanco was just voted sexiest man alive. Thanks 3rd party voters

But no, he has not in fact been officially voted as THE Sexiest Man Alive, although he is on the shortlist so to speak and is heavily featured in the issue. This means he could be crowned People’s Sexiest Man Alive 2024 but he’s currently up against the likes of Glen Powell and Manny Jacinto so the competition is fierce.
The official winner will be announced on Wednesday, so we don’t have long to wait! They will be joining the likes of previous winners such as Patrick Dempsey, Chris Evans, Paul Rudd and Michael B Jordan.
A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez)

During his interview for People’s Sexiest Man Alive 2024, Benny Blanco revealed more about his relationship with Selena Gomez, admitting: “I’m a real morning person. It’s my favourite time to spend with Sel, because we both wake up really early.
“It’s like our moment before the rest of the world wakes up. I have a true best friend that I get to do everything in the world with, and every day is the best day of my life.” That is quite wholesome I won’t lie. Although he did also admit he doesn’t shower every day and we’ll leave it at that.
Looks like we’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see if Benny will be joining the hall of fame as the official sexiest man alive in 2024.
