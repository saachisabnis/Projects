celebrity weddings
Pop star and actress Selena Gomez, best known for her role in "Only Murders in the Building," has announced her engagement to renowned record producer and songwriter Benny Blanco. The 32-year-old shared the joyous news on Instagram, posting a close-up of her diamond ring alongside a series of photos featuring the couple at a romantic picnic. Her caption, "forever begins now," perfectly captured the moment, while Blanco's playful comment, "Hey wait… that's my wife," added a personal touch.
The announcement was met with an outpouring of congratulations from fans and celebrity friends alike. Taylor Swift, a close friend of Gomez, humorously wrote, "Yes I will be the flower girl," while Jennifer Aniston chimed in with, "HONEY!! Congratulations sweet mama!" Other notable names like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cardi B, Lil Nas X, and Julia Michaels also joined in the celebration, making the moment even more special.
Selena Gomez's stunning engagement ring has become a topic of fascination, with experts weighing in on its brilliance. Ann Grimmett, VP of Merchandising at Jared Jewelers, provided HOLA! USA with her professional insight, stating, "Selena Gomez's engagement ring is fitting for a talent as rare as hers given less than 5% of diamonds are marquise." The marquise shape dates back to the 18th century and is enjoying a modern revival, reflecting the trend toward elongated fancy shapes.  
Grimmett described the ring's design as featuring a large marquise diamond estimated to be about 6 carats in an eternity setting. "Considering the large center stone in this setting, we estimate the value to be around $225,000," she noted. The unique cut and timeless appeal make the ring a perfect symbol of Gomez's individuality and elegance.
Gomez and Blanco's relationship, which became public in 2023, has captured the hearts of many. The couple has worked together on several songs, including Gomez's 2023 hit "Single Soon" and their 2019 collaboration "I Can't Get Enough." Their romance reportedly began with Gomez confidently asking Blanco out, a moment he revealed during a livestream with Kai Cenat. "She asked me out," Blanco recounted. "We were just talking, and she was like, 'Do you wanna get dinner?'"
Their love story is marked by sweet, unexpected moments. During their first outing, Blanco doesn't even realize it is a date until Gomez teases him about her outfit choice. By their second meeting, he had figured out her feelings, and as he put it, "The rest is history."
This engagement marks a new chapter in Gomez's life, as she appears more comfortable sharing glimpses of her personal life with fans. Known for being private about her past relationships, including her high-profile romances with Justin Bieber and The Weeknd, Gomez has embraced openness with Blanco. From heartfelt interviews to candid social media posts, she has shared her happiness while maintaining a sense of privacy.
In a recent interview with "The Hollywood Reporter," Gomez explained why this relationship feels different. "I guess this is the safest I've ever felt in one," she said. "And I see a future with this person." 
Gomez has often spoken about her dream of having a family, though her journey to parenthood will be unique due to health challenges. Diagnosed with Lupus and having undergone a kidney transplant, Gomez has been candid about her inability to carry children safely. In an interview with "Vanity Fair," she reflected on grieving this reality but expressed gratitude for alternative paths like surrogacy and adoption.
"I'm excited for what that journey will look like," she shared. "At the end of the day, I don't care. It'll be mine. It'll be my baby."
Fans celebrate their love story as Gomez and Blanco prepare for their future together. With a dazzling engagement ring symbolizing their commitment, the couple has shown that their connection is as genuine as inspiring. "Forever begins now," indeed.
Congratulations, Selena and Benny!
