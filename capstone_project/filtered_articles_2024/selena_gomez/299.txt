Selena Gomez is madly in love. After a romance with The Weeknd and a long-term on-off romance with Justin Bieber, Selena has found “The one.” “I’ve never been loved this way.” Benny Blanco “is supportive and lets Selena be herself,” says a source.  “He’s kind, generous, sincere and loyal. There’s no competition between them like there was with Justin. No one would be surprised if they get engaged soon.”
