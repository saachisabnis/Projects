It was an eventful awards show, to say the least.

 The 76th Primetime Emmys returned to ABC on September 15, 2024, bringing together the biggest stars in Hollywood to celebrate the best in television at downtown Los Angeles's Peacock Theater. Year after year, the ceremony is guaranteed to see the most glamorous couture looks, plenty of sweet red-carpet PDA, and powerful, emotional remarks on stage. The 2023 show alone saw The Bear sweep the categories, Pedro Pascal and Kieran Culkin get into some silly banter, Ebon Moss-Bachrach plant a big kiss on his co-star Matty Matheson’s mouth, and Ali Wong make history. This time around was no different.

 Between The Bear dominating the show yet again and Selena Gomez sparking engagement rumors once more, 2024 was another memorable Emmys in the books. Ahead, InStyle rounded up everything you might have missed from this year's Primetime Emmy Awards.

 It's rare to have Only Murders in the Building co-stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez together and not fooling around. It was no different on the Emmys stage, when they were presenting the first award of the night. Their introduction saw them talking over each other, trolling one another, and erupting in laughter.

 Although she revealed she didn't prepare one, Liza Colón-Zayas gave a moving speech while accepting her first Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of Tina in The Bear. Colón-Zayas urged, "All the Latinas who are looking at me: keep believing and vote. Vote for your rights."

 While accepting the Emmy for Outstanding Scripted Variety Series, Oliver gave a touching tribute to his deceased dog, which was interrupted by music signaling him to wrap up his speech. The talk show host let out a "fuck you" before chaotically dedicating his award to "all dogs."

 "All dogs, you're all very good girls and very good boys," he continued. "You all deserve a treat. Play me off, now!"

 The music producer forewent another opportunity to walk the carpet with the Only Murders star, but made sure to secretly support her inside the ceremony. The love birds were spotted getting cozy while sitting next to each other. Gomez also continued to spark engagement rumors after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on *that* finger.

 In a memeable moment, comedian and screenwriter Will Smith ascended the stage to accept the Emmy award for Writing for a Drama Series for Slow Horses. Once he got there, he started his remarks with, "Despite my name, I come in peace," referencing the infamous moment Bad Boys star Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards.

 You could say The Bear casts' friendships were forged in fire—working in a hot, tense kitchen will have that effect. On-screen chefs turned real-life friends Ayo Edebiri, Liza Colón-Zayas, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach took a moment to show their appreciation for one another by reuniting for a tight hug.

 Dan and Eugene Levy did not disappoint as the first father-son duo to host the Emmys. If their performances in Schitt's Creek were not enough to show they were meant to share the screen, the awards show served as proof. Their silly antics and constant jokes ("[My] most rewarding dad role ever has been being your dad—in Schitt's Creek. Because it got me my first acting Emmy," Eugene quipped at Dan.) had the audience and viewers smiling throughout.

 For a second year in a row, The Bear dominated the Emmys with Jeremy Allen White taking home Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, Liza Colon-Zayas making history for her Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series win, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach clinching Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.
