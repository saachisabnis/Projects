Emmy nominee for her work on Only Murders In The Building, Selena Gomez is moving to the film world in a new biopic about American singer Linda Ronstadt. Gomez is set to play Ronstadt in a movie based on the singer’s 2013 memoir titled Simple Dreams. 
David O. Russell has been announced as the director attached to the film with Ronstadt’s manager, John Boylan co-producing alongside James Keach.
Following rumors about the actress’ involvement with the film, Gomez posted a photo of Ronstadt’s memoir on her Instagram story, and Rolling Stone later confirmed her participation.
The story will follow Ronstadt, who is a rock, country, and Latin music star. She is known for her albums Heart Like a Wheel, Prisoner in Disguise, Hasten Down the Wind, Simple Dreams, and Living in the USA. 
In 2023, her 1970 song “Long Long Time” resurfaced and topped the Spotify charts after the song was featured on an episode of HBO’s The Last of Us. Rondstadt is also the recipient of 11 Grammys, 3 American Music Awards, 2 Academy of Country Awards, and 1 Emmy.
Rondstant, who is now retired due to a progressive supranuclear palsy, was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Latin Grammys.
David O. Russell, who is directing the movie, is known for films like Silver Linings Playbook (2012), American Hustle (2013), and most recently Amsterdam (2022).
The film is currently in pre-production and no release date has been announced.
