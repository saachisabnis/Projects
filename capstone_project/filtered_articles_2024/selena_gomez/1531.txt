A supportive boyfriend. Benny Blanco’s response to Justin and Hailey Bieber’s pregnancy announcement was focused entirely on his girlfriend, Selena Gomez. 
After the Biebers announced they were expecting their first child together on May 9, 2024, Benny took to his Instagram Stories to share a timely video with his followers. The short clip was recorded from a camcorder video, and in it, Selena could be seen blowing a kiss toward the camera (and presumably, at Benny behind the lens) while doing her makeup. She appeared to be holding her Rare Beauty mascara tube in one hand, with the wand in her other hand. While Benny’s Instagram Story didn’t address the recent news about Selena’s ex-boyfriend directly, his post did seem to tell followers everything they needed to know: his girlfriend is doing just fine, thank you very much.

The “Lose You to Love Me” singer and the producer have been dating since June 2023. The pair went public with their relationship a few months later in December 2023, after Selena revealed they were dating when she started liking fan account posts on Instagram speculating that the pair were an item. “He is my absolute everything in my heart,” she commented on one post, confirming that the rumors were true. Since then, the pair have been pretty much inseparable. They often post each other on Instagram, and Benny even attended the 2024 Golden Globes as Selena’s date. 
Things between Benny and Selena seem to be pretty serious, as a source told Us Weekly in May 2024 that Selena considers Benny to be “the love of her life.” According to a second source who spoke to the outlet, “She definitely sees this relationship going the distance. They’ve talked about marriage and having children and are very much on the same page.”
While the happy couple continues to make plans for their future, that hasn’t stopped some from trying to bring Selena’s ex, Justin Bieber, into the conversation. As fans of Justin and Selena know, the pair had an on-again, off-again relationship from 2010 until March 2018. Later that same year, Justin moved on with his now-wife, Hailey Bieber. The pair had a whirlwind romance, getting engaged just a few weeks after they started dating. By September 2018, Justin and Hailey were already married. The pair had a civil ceremony in New York City, and eventually, they had a larger wedding with friends and family in 2019.

 









Now, after nearly six years of marriage, Justin and Hailey have taken the next big step in their relationship. The couple announced on May 9, 2024, that they were expecting their first child together—and naturally, the announcement had some wondering what Justin’s ex, Selena Gomez, made of the news. The Only Murders in the Building star notably disabled her comments in the days leading up to Hailey and Justin’s announcement, only leading to further speculation from social media users who might otherwise hash things out in the comments section of her posts. 
For now, however, we’ll have to take Benny’s post as the clearest update on Selena’s state of mind. The Rare Beauty founder has yet to publicly comment on her ex’s growing family, and her lack of response is a response in itself.
