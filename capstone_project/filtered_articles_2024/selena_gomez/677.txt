Her return to social media comes just one day after she announced she'd be ditching Instagram for a while. The Only Murders In The Building star shared a short clip of her boyfriend Benny Blanco playing with two young children as she made the announcement via her Instagram stories. She wrote: "'I'm off social for a while. I'm focusing on what really matters."
The move came after Selena found herself caught up in a web of drama as she was spotted gossiping with Taylor Swift and Keleigh Teller at the 81st annual Golden Globe Awards. The friends were filmed having what seemed to be a rather serious chat, with Selena leaning in to Taylor and Keleigh to share some juicy gossip.
Fans were unable to hear what the women were talking about but thought she had asked Timothee Chalamet for a picture and his girlfriend Kylie Jenner stopped her. Fans think Selena said to Taylor: "I asked for a picture with him and she [Kylie] said no." To which Keleigh then mouthed: "With Timoth√©e?" to which Selena nodded.
It was suggested that Selena then said: "Do you know what they said/did to me?" before Taylor eyes widened as she replied: "S**t, what the..." The Anti-Hero singer later added: "Oh my God, love you," and Selena replied: "Brought them back together."
But a lip-reading expert exclusively told The Mirror that Selena was talking about her boyfriend Benny Blanco - and not Kylie.
