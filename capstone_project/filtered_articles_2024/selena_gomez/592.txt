This is Selena Gomez's go-to moisturizer for makeup prep. This pillowy lavender-tinted cream is "so thick and yummy that you actually don't need to use that much of it," Gomez shared in her Vogue Beauty Secrets video. As for the dewy finish, you can thank a concoction of plumping Okinawa algae and hyaluronic acid, antioxidant-rich Japanese purple rice, and a blend of ginseng, wild thyme, and sweet marjoram extracts and oils. Dry, chapped skin? Not a chance.

Wearing sunscreen all year long is mandatory so you might as well pick out a formula you actually enjoy wearing daily. Tatcha's The Silk Sunscreen melts into the skin like butter, leaving behind zero white cast. The formula features the brand's silk protein, which is a blend of sericin and fibroin. According to New York City-based dermatologist Morgan Rabach, MD, "sericin forms a layer of protection over the skin and may help promote hydration while fibroin may help repair skin cells and balance moisture levels." When you mix that with the formula's hyaluronic acid, you'll notice dewy and brighter skin.

You may be familiar with bakuchiol as a retinol alternative but what if we told you that cranberry extract and sea fennel also lend similar wrinkle-smoothing, collagen-boosting results? Tatcha's The Silk Serum won a 2023 Best of Beauty Award in the sensitive category and will leave your skin feeling silky-smooth to the touch—literally, as there's silk protein present in the formula.

Considering that The Water Cream is a three-time Allure Readers' Choice Award winner, it's safe to say that this oil-free moisturizer is worth the hype—especially if you have oily skin and find creamier moisturizers too heavy. Its lightweight, gel-like texture instantly absorbs into the skin, and key ingredients such as Japanese wild rose and leopard lily extract curb excess oil, smooth skin texture, and tighten the look of pores. Not to mention, 23-karat gold imparts a subtle glow, which will make you feel oh-so luxe.

The Essence is a hero product that earned a Best of Beauty Award for its skin-plumping abilities. A few pats of this water-like formula all over your face and neck result in a major spike of hydration and allows your subsequent skin-care products to absorb more deeply. The key is in the proprietary trio of Japanese superfoods rich in lactic acid and other alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs)—Akita rice, Uji green tea, and Okinawa algae—which work harmoniously to retain moisture and promote cell turnover. "It leaves my skin looking like it took a page straight out of the glass-skin handbook," Allure's commerce editor Sarah Han previously shared.
"I apply this before moisturizer, as it makes it more effective, and helps to plump up your complexion," Daniel Martin, makeup artist and global director of artistry & education at Tatcha, tells us.

Indigo Overnight Repair is a soothing cream that is incredibly kind to sensitive skin and a damaged skin barrier. "Think of this cream as a serum-moisturizer hybrid: It's infused with tried-and-true skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides to hydrate and plump your skin," commerce writer Jennifer Hussein shared, who has been loving this on her acne-prone skin.
Martin also agrees that the texture is "super dreamy" and works wonderfully on irritated skin. "I've been using it a ton this summer, especially when I haven't been as careful as I should be with reapplying my sunscreen," he divulges. Also in the mix is microbiome-balancing mondo grass root and soothing Japanese indigo extract to minimize signs of redness and irritation.

Melt every last bit of dirt, sunscreen, and makeup (including waterproof mascara) with The Camellia Cleansing Oil. This non-comedogenic, fragrance-free oil is spiked with lightweight tsubaki oil, which is rich in vitamins A, B, D, and E, as well as multiple omega fatty acids to deeply nourish skin as it breaks down the day's grime. It washes away cleanly and leaves your skin feeling as soft as a baby's butt.

The Deep Cleanse is essentially the end-all cleanser for oily skin. Proof: It scored an Allure Best of Beauty Award two years in a row. This pore-purging gel lathers into a foam as you massage it into your skin and contains ground-up fibers from the Japanese luffa fruit to gently exfoliate and boost cell turnover. As a bonus, amino acids derived from silk seriously rehydrate skin so your complexion never feels stripped—just balanced and clean.

With Japanese peach at its base, The Kissu Lip Mask works similarly to a hydrating face mask but is formulated especially for the delicate skin on your lips. Right away your lips will feel soft and moisturized, and over time, you may even notice a smoother, more plumped look. Plus, you don't have to mess with constant reapplication. "I smear it on in the morning before my coffee—and my lips still look lush and juicy by the time lunchtime rolls around," our reviewer noted. 'Nuff said.

Formulated with a powerful blend of 20 percent vitamin C and 10 percent AHA, it won't take long for this lightweight Violet-C Brightening Serum to even out any discoloration or overall dull, lifeless skin. The formula utilizes Japanese angelica root as its effective yet gentle dark-spot-reducing agent. It absorbs almost instantly into the skin so you can go in with your moisturizer or night cream without a bunch of downtime in between.

Tatcha's beloved Dewy lineup absolutely deserves a spot in your shopping cart. The Dewy Serum relies on lactic acid and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) to smooth uneven texture and skin tone while hyaluronic acid and squalane work hard to replenish moisture levels. "The milky, floral serum replaces all the moisture that was sucked out of [my skin] like dehydration never even happened," said former beauty editor Devon Abelman.

As the last step before makeup, apply the oil-free Liquid Silk Canvas Primer to create a green-tea-fueled shield around the skin that will not only protect it against environmental pollutants but keep your makeup in place for hours on end. Three types of silk (fibroin, sericin, and silk powder) also blur enlarged pores and absorb excess oil, so skin doesn't appear overly shiny.

Pucker up and swipe on Tatcha's The Kissu Lip Tint SPF 35, a skin-softening lip balm available in three classic shades, including the true-red Camellia, seen above. This little tube of tinted lip balm keeps chapping and dryness to a minimum thanks to a combination of silk protein and lanolin.
