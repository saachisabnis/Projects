It’s official! Selena Gomez got engaged to Benny Blanco during a romantic Taco Bell picnic (relatable queen). She shared a lil dump on Instagram with shots of the proposal setup, her ear-to-ear smile, and the *stunning* ring. And, of course, her rock was paired with a stunning bridal-esque mani.
The second most important part of an engagement (step one is finding your dream partner) is being prepared with the right nail color. So, if you want the details on Sel’s manicure, we gotchu covered. She went with Chanel’s Le Vernis in Ballerina, and it’s the ideal combo of pale pigments and glossy finish.
Ahead, find the best nail polishes to replicate Selena’s chic engagement nails.
I mean, I’m definitely not surprised that Selena wore this luxe polish for her big engagement. So if you’re looking to splurge on a designer color and wanna twin with her, this is the *exact* shade she said “Yes” in!
OPI’s Bubble Bath shade is a mainstay on my mani rotation, and it looks nearly identical to the luxe Chanel one. Pro tip: For a closer match to Selena’s nails, use just one coat. In two coats you get an opaque neutral pink, gorge for a bride or simply for everyday wear.
More of a press-on nail person? No worries, this Glamnetic set will give you the most gorgeous and sleek pastel pink.
Essie’s Longwear Polish has the same lasting powers of gel—no UV lamp needed! And I’d say this shade match is pretty dang close.
You can never go wrong with a quick-drying nail polish, and the shade Pointe from Olive & June gives the same ballet vibes as the Chanel hue. 
This single polish acts as a gel base coat, top coat, and color coat. Simply apply two layers, cure under a lamp, and voilà! Weeks of pretty pink nails in just minutes.<3
