MIAMI - The Emmy nominations announced on Wednesday have made Latino entertainment history. Sofía Vergara, Selena Gomez, Liza Colón-Zayas and Nava Mau have been recognized for their work in television, while Eiza González, Ricky Martin, Moisés Arias and Issa López have also received nods through their projects,
There were also some painful snubs, but nevertheless, the news highlights the remarkable achievements of Latina actresses in television.
All nominations were hard earned: It was Vergara's first dramatic role and it is Gomez's first Emmy recognition as actress for "Only Murders in the Building." Colón-Zayas and Mau, on their end, had never been nominated before.
Sofía Vergara, known for her long-running role on "Modern Family," has been nominated for her first Emmy in a limited series for her role in "Griselda." This marks a significant milestone in her career, showcasing her versatility as an actress beyond the comedic roles that made her a household name. This nomination also highlights her continued impact on the industry, as she moves from ensemble casts to leading roles in limited series.
"Griselda was my first dramatic role ever, and it took us 15 years to bring her to life. I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who was a part of this series. I could have never done this without my director Andres Baiz, my costar Alberto Guerra, Eric Newman and the full creative team," Vergara wrote on social media. She also thanked her partners, cast and crew.
"I never dreamed that after "Modern Family" I would be able to be a part of something as special as "Griselda." I'm honored to be recognized alongside Jodi (Foster), Brie (Larson), Juno (Temple,) and Naomi (Watts,) incredible women who gave us incredible TV this year. Thank you to the television academy for this incredible honor! ❤️

Selena Gomez has also been recognized once again, adding to her growing list of accolades. Previously nominated for her work in "Only Murders in the Building" as producer, the Emmys this time nominated her as best actress in a comedy series.  Gomez continues to impress critics and audiences alike with her dynamic performances. Her continued presence in major award nominations underscores her talent and the industry's recognition of her abilities.
Puerto Rican Liza Colón-Zayas and Mexican Nava Mau have received their first nominations for their roles in "The Bear" and "Baby Reindeer," respectively. Colón-Zayas has been praised for her compelling portrayal in the critically acclaimed series, while Mau's nomination marks a breakthrough moment for transgender representation at the Emmys. Their nominations not only celebrate their individual talents but also signify a broader shift towards inclusivity in the entertainment industry.
This year's Emmy nominations also spotlight the work of the team led by  Issa López behind "True Detective: Night Country." The series, which has captivated audiences with its gripping narrative, is helmed by the talented Mexican writer and director, further emphasizing the importance of diverse voices in the industry.
Mexican actress Eiza González, Ricky Martin and Moisés Arias are part of the nominated series "3 Body Problem," "Palm Royale," and "Fallout."
