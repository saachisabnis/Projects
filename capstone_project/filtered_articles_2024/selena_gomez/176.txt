Laredo is ringing in the New Year with a special tribute to the legendary Selena, courtesy of Joe Ojeda, the former keyboardist of Selena y Los Dinos. Ojeda, a Grammy Award winner, will headline a Selena tribute show at Cosmo’s Bar and Grill, giving fans a chance to experience the unforgettable hits of the Queen of Tejano music.
On December 31st, starting at 8 p.m., Cosmo’s Bar and Grill will offer a festive five-course dinner with champagne for just $25. At 11 p.m., Ojeda will take the stage with his tribute band, Tributo A La Reina, delivering the music that made Selena an icon. This event promises an unforgettable night of music, food, and celebration.
In addition to the tribute performance, Ojeda recently released a new single, “Maldito Castigo,” featuring Laredo-based singer Lorena Gomez. The cumbia track, co-written by Ojeda and Gomez, is a reflection of their artistic chemistry and marks Ojeda’s return to the music scene.
