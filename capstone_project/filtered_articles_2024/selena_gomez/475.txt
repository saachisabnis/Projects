Selena Gomez relished the challenge of making 'Emilia Perez'.
Selena Gomez loved starring in the movie
The 32-year-old actress starred alongside Zoe Saldana, Karla Sofía Gascon and Adriana Paz in the musical crime comedy film, and Selena has now suggested that it was a unique experience in her career.
The brunette beauty - who plays Jessi Del Monte in the Jacques Audiard-directed movie - told 'Extra': "I think I’ve been dreaming of doing a role like this for many reasons. 
"I felt challenged and I felt excited and eager to see all the places that Jacques was going to take me and it was a million times better than I even imagined because I got to meet these women and it just felt like a whole experience that I had never felt before and I hope this is just the beginning."
Selena also admitted that she feels "really lucky" to have been a part of the movie.

The actress said: "I’m just enjoying it moment by moment. I feel really lucky to be with these amazing women and I just love every moment, so I’m soaking it all in."

Earlier this year, Selena claimed that she hasn't even "scratched the surface" of her acting ambitions.

The Hollywood star has enjoyed huge success with 'Emilia Perez' and 'Only Murders in the Building', the mystery comedy-drama series - but Selena insisted that she still has so many ambitions to achieve as an actress.

Selena - who has also enjoyed success in the music world - told The Hollywood Reporter: "Acting has, and will always be, my heart.

"There’s so much that I want to do and that I haven’t even scratched the surface of, and it’s exciting to me."
