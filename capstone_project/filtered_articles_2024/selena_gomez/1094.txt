From timeless styles like Grace Kelly’s Cartier rock to trendy cuts like Selena Gomez’s marquise sparkler
There are few accessories that capture the public’s attention as much as celebrity engagement rings.
Besides the obvious wow factor inherently associated with massive diamonds, these one-of-a-kind accoutrements also intimately illuminate the relationships of the world’s rich and famous, from Prince Harry sourcing a Botswana diamond for Duchess Meghan to Machine Gun Kelly installing thorns in Megan Fox’s engagement band. The rings are also often harbingers of engagement ring trends to come, whether that means Princess Kate reviving the floral cluster halo design or Selena Gomez cementing the marquise-cut diamond for a new generation of brides.
