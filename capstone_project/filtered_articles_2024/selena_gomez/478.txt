 Selena Gomez has always loved to cook, but during the pandemic, she turned her curiosity of cooking into a true passion. On her Food Network series “Selena + Chef'' — which premiered in August 2020 and finished its fourth season — Gomez invites celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsey and Rachael Ray into her own home for virtual and in-person cooking lessons. And while she might not yet be a pro chef herself, Selena’s kitchen looks the part nonetheless. 

 The recent premiere of the show’s restaurant-focused spinoff, “Selena + Restaurant,” has inspired me to rewatch past episodes of “Selena + Chef,” and I’m coveting every single tool and appliance the multihyphenate uses. Gomez’s kitchen is decked out with colorful, professional-grade gear from brands like KitchenAid, Our Place, and Le Creuset. Read on to shop Selena Gomez’s kitchen staples at Amazon — starting at just $5.

 Le Creuset’s classic Dutch oven is a staple in Selena Gomez’s kitchen, and we can understand why. The 5.5-quart cast iron pot is one of the most versatile items you can add to your collection, coming in handy for everything from baking bread to simmering soup. The enameled Dutch oven comes in a wide variety of colors, but Gomez went with light pink and Marseille, a royal blue shade that adds a pop of fun to her stovetop.

 When it comes time to pull out the kitchen scale, Gomez opts for this now-$10 powerhouse from Bagail Basics. The scale measures 8 by 6 inches, giving it a very small countertop footprint, and it features a handy tare button, allowing you to measure in the vessel of your choice. It also provides accurate measurements in grams, ounces, milliliters, and pounds. Best of all, the surface is waterproof, protecting the control panel during those inevitable spills.

Amazon
 Selena Gomez has collaborated with Our Place multiple times, so I wasn’t surprised to see her using the Perfect Pot in the most recent season of “Selena + Chef.” The celeb worked with Our Place on several limited edition colors last year (one of which you can still get) and uses her ceramic Perfect Pot in rosa (a magenta hue) in several episodes. The pot comes with a built-in pasta strainer among other genius features, and it’s 21% off in five colors at Amazon right now.

 Nearly every episode of “Selena + Chef” begins with Gomez standing behind her kitchen island with this ultra-thick cutting board. The maplewood block is 18 by 18 by 3 inches in size, making it sturdy enough not to warp or split over time. We named John Boos our top cutting board during testing thanks to its reliability and aesthetic appeal, so it comes as no surprise that Selena has been using hers for all four seasons of the show.

Amazon
 I never thought I could get excited about a vegetable peeler, until I saw Selena Gomez using a baby pink one to peel ginger in a recent episode. I found a similar one at Amazon that costs just $5 for a set of three peelers — each with flexible, rust-proof ceramic blades and a hanging loop for easy storage. Snag yours now for less than $2 apiece.

 Iridescent pink cooking products could make anyone love baking — especially when it’s a high-performing KitchenAid stand mixer. This classic, multifunctional appliance is a longtime Food & Wine favorite thanks to its powerful motor and durability, and Selena Gomez seems to agree. The star’s uses this rose gold mixer in several episodes of “Selena + Chef,” and thanks to its eye-catching color, she keeps it displayed on the countertop even when not in use.
