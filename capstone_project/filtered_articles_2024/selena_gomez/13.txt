Need to know his plans for his wedding toenail art
I’m just going to say it outright but something about Benny Blanco has always given me the ick, and now I know his unique toenail art is all to blame.
In truth, I never thought I’d be willingly seeing Benny Blanco’s toenails let alone the art that goes along with it but there we go. I won’t lie the level of intricacy which must have gone into the design is really amazing, so let’s get into it all.

Benny Blanco shared a picture of his toenail art on Instagram a few months ago and the design is inspired by Persian rugs. But that’s not all, he’s literally had mini rug tassels glued onto the end of his toenails and genuinely imagine being Selena Gomez sleeping in bed and feeling a soft tickle of tasselled toenails next to you. Genuine nightmare fuel.
Given that Benny Blanco has a whopping net worth of over $50 million I think this man could afford to get his toenails done every day of the month. I think for his wedding nails he should have a mini Selena Gomez and instead of a tasselled rug, he could make the ends into a veil or something.

And that’s not all as he also got some pickle inspired nail art, inspired by Selena Gomez’s favourite brand of pickles. Honestly if that’s not true love I actually don’t know what is.
