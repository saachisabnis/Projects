Gals, have we been lied to?!
So, in case you were somehow living on a desert island with no 4G and missed it, Selena Gomez announced her engagement to Benny Blanco yesterday. I may never recover. But are we so sure that the engagement actually happened this week? People are theorising Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco may have been secretly engaged since August, and not going to lie, the evidence is pretty convincing. Here’s a rundown of all the reasons why they could have hidden their engagement for months.
Let’s please start by examining the engagement photos themselves. There’s one picture in particular which just makes very little sense to me.

Are we expected to believe they went on a picnic in a park in December? Why are the Taco Bell boxes positioned so we can see the logo? Did Taco Bell sponsor their engagement? Did they pay for the ring? Clips on Selena’s Instagram make it look like this picnic wasn’t outside at all, but was at some kind of sound stage. The plot thickens.

Please note that Selena Gomez has very similar nails in the other engagement pics to her nails in July and August. Of course, a girl can have the same colour nails twice. But it’s perfectly feasible that some of the other pics could have been taken in the summer.

Sorry, but this piece of evidence is the most damning. Why on earth would Selena put those little heart emojis over the exact spot where an engagement ring would be? And more importantly, how on earth could Selena reveal this photo to her 423 million followers and not expect them to reach this conclusion? Maybe she just really rated this pic and put the emojis there at the last minute. But could it have been a deliberate ploy to spark engagement rumours? And what human would do that who wasn’t already engaged?
Er, so the Daily Mail says an inside source revealed Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco actually got engaged in August, but delayed the anouncement because of Justin Bieber drama.
The insider reportedly said, “They became engaged in August and Selena didn’t want her engagement to be tied to Bieber in any way. They knew it would. Selena knew that there would be stories accusing her of getting engaged to turn attention away from Justin’s baby, or that people would claim that she did this to one up him.”
For context, Justin and Hailey Bieber’s son Jack was born on 22nd August.
Selena Gomez doesn’t seem to relish in online drama. She definitely likes taking breaks from social media. And she has tried to distance herself from the constant comparisons between her and Hailey Bieber. Selena has called out her followers before for sending nasty messages to Hailey Bieber. So, I believe Selena would want to announce her engagement in the most drama-free way possible. I’m just not convinced she’d delay sharing such big news for four months purely because of this reason. God forbid a woman do anything without it being all about her ex-boyfriend!
Way back in May, Benny Blanco confirmed on The Howard Stern Show that he definitely saw marriage in his future with Selena Gomez. Now, the engagement ring is absolutely gorgeous, but did it really take Benny Blanco seven months to pick it?

And obvs, DeuxMoi knows everything. So, the gossip site said on 4th August that they’d received a blind item. It read, “This A-list actress/semi-retired singer got engaged over the weekend to her bf of a year recently surrounded by friends at their usual beach house hang out.”
Now, DeuxMoi just published what it receives. It doesn’t claim all the information is true. But a lot of people have put this information alongside all these other details, and theorised away. Wherever Selena Gomez got secretly engaged to Benny Blanco in August or not, they seem super cute together and I’m deeply invested xxx
