Zoe Saldaña, the actress known for her starring roles in franchises such as Avatar, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Trek, will be honored with the Vanguard Award at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival.
The festival, presented by the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), will run from October 26 to November 2. It is in celebration of both independent and studio films, alongside panel discussions and workshops.
Saldaña, at the ripe age of 46, is also gaining recognition for her performance in Emilia Pérez. This bold musical is directed by Jacques Audiard. At this year’s Cannes Film Festival, she shared the Best Actress prize with her co-stars Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz for their roles in the film. She is the only performer in history to star in four films grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. 
Her Vanguard Award will be presented following a screening of Emilia Pérez on Friday, November 1 at the SCAD Trustees Theater. Before that, at 5:15 p.m. ET, Saldaña will participate in a career-retrospective conversation at the SCAD Museum of Art. She will be speaking with Scott Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter. This is going to offer people the chance to hear her reflect on her career. 
Christina Routhier, the festival’s executive director, expressed her excitement for this year’s event. It will certainly unite the film community. With more surprises and highlights on the horizon, anticipation continues to build among fans.
