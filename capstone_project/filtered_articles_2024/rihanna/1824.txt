Rihanna Navy, get ready to rejoice!
The multi-talented 36-year-old icon, known for her groundbreaking music and revolutionary beauty brand Fenty Beauty, has given a long-awaited update on her music career. After causing a stir last week by sporting a shirt emblazoned with the words “I’m Retired,” Rihanna is here to set the record straight about her musical hiatus.
At the launch of Fenty Hair in Los Angeles on Monday (June 10), Rihanna offered insights into her creative process and the status of her highly anticipated R9 album. “I think that music, for me, is a new discovery,” she shared with ET. “I’m rediscovering things. I have been working on the album for so long that I kinda put all that stuff aside and now I’m prepared to go back in the studio. I’m gonna start — give me a second!”
With a fresh perspective and renewed enthusiasm, Rihanna revealed her intention to revisit her musical journey, also addressing the intriguing “I’m Retired” shirt, Rihanna clarified, “Yeah, I’m starting over. But I don’t want to neglect the songs that I have, so I actually want to go back and listen to stuff with new ears, with my new perspective and then see what applies and what I’m still in love with.”
While fans eagerly await new music from Rihanna, they can take solace in the fact that her last album, Anti, released in 2016, continues to captivate audiences with its timeless sound and groundbreaking tracks. As Rihanna embarks on this new chapter in her musical journey, anticipation is high, and the Rihanna Navy stands united in support of their beloved icon.
With her unparalleled talent and visionary approach to music, Rihanna’s return to the studio promises to be nothing short of extraordinary. As she delves into this new phase of creativity, fans can expect to be treated to a musical experience unlike any other, as Rihanna once again redefines the boundaries of artistry and innovation.
