ASAP Rocky isn't interested in waging a lyrical war with Drake.
The Harlem rapper made this quite clear in a recent interview with Billboard, insisting his problems with Drizzy are trivial in the grand scheme of things.
"You got to realize, certain n****s was throwing shots for years," Rocky told the magazine. "I ain't in the middle of that shit. That's not how I retaliate right now. I got bigger fish to fry than some pussy boys. It is real beef outside. It is real. N****s getting really clipped and blitzed every day. N****s sniping n****s every day. That little kitty shit ain’t about nothing."
These comments come nearly a year after Drake seemingly took aim at Rocky in "Fear of Heights," a standout cut from his eighth studio album, For All The Dogs. Many were convinced that Drake was subbing Rocky and his longtime partner Rihanna. "I had way badder bitches than you, TBH Yeah," he rapped in the song. "That man, he still with you, he can’t leave you/ Y’all go on vacation, I bet it’s Antilles."
The drama spilled into 2024, after Rocky appeared on Kid Cudi's track "Wow," where he questioned why an unnamed individual was "causing a scene" before referencing the "mandrake" medicinal plant.
"My boo got the Glizzy, keep the receipt if it’s beef," Rocky rapped. "Cheffin' mans, Boyardee, with the latest Goyard/ Me and my vamp bae got our own handshake/ These n****s can't stomach me, gotta go get a mandrake."
And the subs didn't end there. Fans were convinced that Rocky fired more shots at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin's "Show of Hands." Listeners suspected that the ASAP Mob de facto boss alluded to having sex with Drake's baby mama, Sophie Brussaux, before she gave birth.

Drake seemingly fired back in "Family Matters," after which Rocky came through with "Highjack" — a Jessica Pratt-assisted single in which he delivered several lines that were apparently aimed at the 6 God. 
"These n****s want my wife bad, the people want my next track," he declared. "The coppers want my black ass, fucked up, but it’s like that."
"Highjack" is expected to appear on Rocky’s fourth studio album, Don’t Be Done, which is scheduled to drop on Aug. 30. You can check out the song’s official video below.
