“It was ripped away from me,” Lil Wayne tells a crowd of his fellow New Orleanians during his annual Weezyana Fest. In September, Kendrick Lamar was chosen to headline the Super Bowl Halftime performance. The decision was met with an onslaught of criticism especially from Lil Wayne’s Young Money/Cash Money family members Nicki Minaj and Birdman.
Lil Wayne did admit to feeling “hurt” by the decision, but his latest comments indicate that this hurt runs deep. That said, witnessing the festival’s turnout gave him something that the Super Bowl cannot. “I worked my a** off to get in that position and it was ripped away from me,” Lil Wayne tells the crowd. “But this motherf*king moment right here? They can’t take that.”

While many people like Nicki Minaj and Birdman, spoke out about the decision to select Kendrick Lamar as the Super Bowl Halftime performer; many came to his aid, like Rihanna. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the singer says she believes Kendrick Lamar’s selection was fate, almost “meant to be.” She added, “It’s Kendrick Lamar! Kendrick Lamar is the one to do it right now. He’s gonna crush it.”
Rihanna doesn’t doubt that Lamar will be able to stun the crowd and those at home with his performance: “We should never doubt him. He’s an amazing artist, top-tier. He had an incredible year,” she said. “He actually brought so many people together. It’s to be celebrated. That’s what culture is. He deserves it. I cannot wait to see it. Kendrick, thank you.”
