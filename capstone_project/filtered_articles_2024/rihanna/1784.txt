And they're going to Rihanna's childhood home.
California Dreams was better than Saved by the Bell. There, I said it.
 The 13 teams racing across the globe in the hopes of winning $1 million on season 36 of The Amazing Race have been revealed and include twins, a pair of Air Force pilots, a duo of firefighter moms, and a former first-round NFL draft pick racing with his wife.

 This season (which premieres March 13 on CBS and once again features no non-elimination legs) begins in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as teams will have to participate in a Mexican rodeo and must “lasso their way to the finish line without coming in last.” Other tasks this season include paragliding in Colombia and rally car racing in Argentina. The course will also wind its way through two new countries for the show as players will swim through waterfalls in the Dominican Republic while also visiting Rihanna’s childhood home in Barbados. Yes, that Rihanna.

 It has been a long wait for the season 36 cast, who originally filmed this installment back in the fall of 2022 as what was then supposed to be the 35th season of the reality franchise. With the writers and actors strikes of 2023, however, CBS decided to specifically film a season that could run as 90-minute episodes, so flipped seasons 35 and 36. Once the strikes were over, the network then decided to keep the show at 90 minutes, so the new season 36 will be running at the longer airtime anyway.

 That means we’ll get to see even more of contestants like Rod Gardner, who played six seasons in the NFL after being selected 15th overall in the 2001 draft by Washington. He will be joined by wife Leticia in his quest for more competition glory. But they will have to battle 12 other teams to take home the loot. Get your official first look at those teams below.
