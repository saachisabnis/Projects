The billionaire also shares her desire to have a daughter with more children.
She continued: “I don’t know what God wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl. But of course, if it’s another boy, it’s another boy.”
Rihanna and A$AP Rocky have two children. They had their first child in 2022 after being quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I felt like god knew we needed because we were going to start a family,” she said. “And had it not been for COVID, we would’ve taken a lot more time to get comfortable with each other, to even know that we were ready.”
Even though Ri Ri craves more children, she had never discussed children with Rocky while the pandemic was in progress.
“We didn’t even really talk about [having kids]. There was no denying it. It was the best thing that ever happened to us. It just happened.”
She added, “I let God lead and just let go. Because in previous relationships, I tried and tried and tried my best, and you still feel like it’s not enough. So when someone sees you completely, believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling. I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.”
In November 2023, Rocky told the press that having children with Rihanna was his best collaboration. 
During the interview, Rihanna also discussed her empire, dating Rocky, and new music.
