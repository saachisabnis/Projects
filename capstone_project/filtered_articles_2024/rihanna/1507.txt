Suge Knight has claimed that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre are among those involved in a ‘secret ‘society’ with Diddy.
On a new episode of Collect Call With Suge Knight that premiered on Monday (March 11) via Dave Mays’ Breakbeat Media, the former music mogul suggested that rappers painting their nails and buying Diddy gifts are indications of them being a part of an exclusive group.

“Once they start painting they fingernails and wearing women’s clothes, they got you,” he said. “I remember when they was giving Puffy an award at the ASCAP Awards — Andre went up there and got him an expensive watch and gave it to him in front of everybody.
“He basically confessed his love to this man. Then Puffy and Snoop became besties. Every time you see one, you seen the other one. Next thing you know, they start painting they fingernails. Didn’t make sense.”

He continued: “[The] Game bought Puffy a Lamborghini when Puffy got more money than Game. Why you buying this man a Lamborghini? You know your homies don’t even got a Lamborghini. But once again, it’s that secret society.
“For this thing to work and fix it, they gotta start all the way over in these major record labels and these big buildings. They need to get rid of all the guys who was connected to the poison and the snake.”
Suge Knight has previously talked about Dre, Snoop and Diddy on his podcast as well as the aforementioned ‘secret society.’ Back in February, he referenced the N.W.A beatmaker’s history of violence against women and his participation in said group while defending Chris Brown.
“You can have a man that’s part of that secret society and they gonna give him an award — the Impact Award,” he said. “That muthafucka beat up more bitches than anybody. This man gets an award for beating up women.”

The incarcerated record executive then compared Dre’s situation to Chris Brown’s 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna, saying: “Chris Brown is stripped of his crown, and not saying it was right that him and Rihanna got into it and they had a fight or he beat her up …
“I’m not saying that, but what I’m saying is this: he had a fight with one woman or he beat up one woman, and they still casting stones at him.”

He added: “They don’t give him his cigar, they don’t let him come perform, they don’t let him pretty much win awards. But you can have an Impact Award with Andre.”
