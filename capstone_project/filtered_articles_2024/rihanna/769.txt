There are so many dogs who have been in shelters far too long and one of these dogs is an adorable Pit Bull mix named Rihanna who has been in a Maryland shelter for 426 days.
When you hear about how awesome she is it's pretty unfathomable that someone hasn't given her a forever home yet!
The Montgomery County Animal Services And Adoption Center explains that Rihanna is not only house trained and crate trained, but that she is great with kids, smart as a whip and good on her leash! She does need to go to a home with no other pets, however.
Here's another sweet post about beautiful Rihanna.
It's so heartbreaking because the shelter explained that Rihanna was briefly adopted, but she was returned to the shelter through no fault of her own and that "upon her return, staff members report that Rihanna resisted returning to her kennel, urinated on herself, and had a visibly broken heart."
This poor girl needs the best forever home as soon as possible. You can just tell she'd make someone the most wonderful companion ever. Fingers crossed for you Rihanna!
Adopting a dog, especially a dog that has spent weeks or months in a shelter, if an absolutely wonderful thing to do. But there are many important factors to take into consideration before you add a fur baby to your family, and they can include things like how much time do you have to spend with a dog? Do you work long hours? If you are gone most of the day it may be a good idea to adopt an older dog instead of a puppy who needs frequent attention and bathroom breaks.
Where you live. A larger dog may need a yard or close access to a park so they can have room to run, where a smaller dog may be better suited to apartment living.
What grooming requirements a dog has. Are you willing to shell out money for monthly grooming appointments or do you want a shorter hair breed dog who can do with the occasional bath?
Do you want a more playful dog, a dog that follows commands well, or a lazy dog? The AKC is such a wonderful resource for information on so many different dog breeds. You can also ask shelter volunteers what they would suggest for the best type of dog for your family. We are sure they'd love to match you with your forever friend. If you are interested in donating, volunteering, or adopting your own cat or dog, please check with your local animal rescue, breed specific rescue, or Humane Society.
