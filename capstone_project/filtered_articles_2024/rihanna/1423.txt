	That’s right, ladies and gents! A$AP Rocky just confirmed that his itty bitty son Riot Rose — whose name, sex, and exact birthday were up in the air for so long last year — turned 1 yesterday. (Or close enough to yesterday that the rapper had the desire to post a sweet birthday tribute on Instagram.)

	










	“HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY TO MY 2ND BORN SON RIOT ROSE MAYERS ❤️,” the clearly excited dad of two wrote alongside an adorable carousel of photos and videos.

	In the opening shot, A$AP sits with Riot on one knee and his son RZA, 2 — both of whom he shares with Rihanna — on the other. In a later photo and video, it’s clear Riot is just as in love with his dad as the “Sundress” rapper is with his son. In a precious home video, A$AP Rocky holds Riot, rocking him back and forth and kissing him on the cheek. The little guy has a straight face until he turns and looks at his dad. Then he immediately the widest open-mouth smile. It’s seriously too cute!

	Then there are two screenshots of FaceTime calls that are just heart-melting. Riot’s eyes crinkle as he gives his dad another big smile that shows off his teeth. “Them 2 lil teeth at the bottom 😊,” one person commented because they’re so cute!



	“We love to see father and son bonding,” another fan commented.

	“My heart 🥹 you are such an amazing father ❤️”

	In May, A$AP Rocky posted an equally sweet birthday tribute for RZA that made it especially clear why a fan would say, “Had the same baby twice 😍” this time around. With all the family photos of Rihanna, Riot, and RZA and more throwback pics of the power couple’s firstborn as a baby, it looks like the brothers could be twins.

	Really freakin’ cute twins! So cute, in fact, that they’ve both been models. The two of them joined their dad in a Bottega Veneta campaign, and RZA is one of the new faces of his mom’s brand, Savage X FENTY. Last month, he and his dad posed in Savage X Classics sets (black tank tops with black boxer briefs that have the “Diamonds” singer’s brand’s name along the waistband). And we’re sure it won’t be long until Riot is flaunting his mom’s gear too.
