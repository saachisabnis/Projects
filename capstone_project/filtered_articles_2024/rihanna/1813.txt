Rumors are circulating on social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit and TikTok that Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar are collaborating on a new song, sparking speculation about a potential anti-Drake track.
While some fans are excited about the possibility of a new project from Rihanna, others doubt the credibility of the news.
Drake hit at Rihanna’s partner, A$AP Rocky, on his “Family Matters” track and mentioned Rihanna, which makes sense since she may hit back at her former lover.
Do you think Rihanna and Kendrick will collaborate on a song against Drake?
