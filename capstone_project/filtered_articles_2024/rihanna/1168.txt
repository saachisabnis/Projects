“My lazy days consist of always wearing a scrunchie because I want [my hair] out of the way,” she revealed. “So I find myself always wearing a scrunchie on my wrist. I want it out of my way. I don’t want it to be on my kids when I lean forward; just messy!
“Whether you have tendrils or whatever, you still gotta keep it together because when Rocky comes home, I don’t want to look busted either. There’s the first half of the day and then there’s the dad’s coming home [half]!”
A$AP Rocky is just as obsessed with Rihanna.
Talking to Billboard about his new music for an in-depth interview published last month, Rocky opened up about his life at home and why he and Rih are so equally yoked.

“It’s crazy how we find balance with our chaotic schedules,” he said. “[The relationship] is going great. I don’t think there’s a more perfect person because when the schedules are hectic, she’s very understanding of that. And when the schedule’s freed up, that’s when you get to spend [the] most time together. It’s all understanding and compatibility.”
As for his forthcoming album Don’t Be Dumb, Rocky told the publication it will be his best piece of work so far – even though got delayed past its initial August 30 release date.

The article also offers some insight into Don’t Be Dumb: “He’s only been working on it for the past year but he believes, like most artists discussing their new work, that it’s the best album he’s ever made.
“Don’t Be Dumb skews slightly heavier topically and goes deeper than Rocky’s usual vainglorious works. The 35-year-old jack-of-all-that’s-fly chalks this up to him getting older (“I’m an OG now”) and wiser and the world being batshit crazy at the moment.

Don’t Be Dumb will serve as A$AP Rocky’s first album in six years and the follow up to his third LP Testing, which arrived to mixed reviews in 2018.
