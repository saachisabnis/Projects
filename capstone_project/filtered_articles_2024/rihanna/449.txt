	Besides offering a glossing sheen over your lips, the Fenty Beauty Gloss Stick comes in a variety of shades from the deep statement-making red of Black’r Berry to the rosy mauve color of RiRi. While the Blaz’D Donut shade is out of stock at Sephora, you can still find the exact one Lisa wore in her TikTok at Fenty Beauty and Ulta Beauty — and for under $30.

		This celebrity-approved gloss stick comes in eleven different shades for you to stock up on. With ingredients like vitamin E and shea butter, you’ll notice a soft and hydrating feel from first apply. Plus, it also comes with squalane to help lock in moisture for up to eight hours. 	

	Whether you’re on the hunt for a fresh celebrity-approved item to add to your cart or just want something to complete your Halloween look, reviewers are considering this gloss stick is a must-have. 

	One Ulta Beauty shopper noted how the formula “feels very creamy and hydrating when you first apply” while the color appears “very pigmented but can be sheered out.”
