Rihanna may be a mother of two and possibly married to A$AP Rocky, but many men still daydream about her. Recently, she gave everyone something else to think about whenever fantasizing about her.
Yesterday, the bombshell from Barbados took to Instagram to post a video of her new photoshoot in which the 36-year-old was decked out in “schoolgirl” attire and flashed her panties as she walked away. Looking like she could easily walk into any high school and not be questioned about her age, Rihanna once again reminded us why she’s one of the baddest women alive and in the caption took a humbling and comedic approach to her beauty writing, “since I clearly won’t be achieving my six pack til next summer, I switched my summer goal to matching my shoes to my panties!”
The new post comes weeks after she posed as a schoolgirl in a promo clip for her FENTY x PUMA collection. No panties were shown in this video, but needless to say, fans still took notice of her schoolgirl look. Whether that leads to high schoolers actually buying the merchandise remains to be seen, but we’re not mad at her effort.
