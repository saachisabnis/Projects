Rihanna’s former stylist and current Interview editor-in-chief say that she wants a breast lift. “I want my ti__ies pinned back to my shoulders, precisely where they used to be,” said the Fenty Beauty founder: “I don’t want implants.
 Just a lift.” As for the popular BBL surgeries, Rihanna says she’ll stick to squats.
 "My whole t_ts and BBL fantasy is on the record," laughed Rihanna. 
Fans quickly let Riri know how they felt about any possible procedures the mother of two may be considering. "She's too naturally beautiful for cosmetic surgery anyway. She doesn't need it," as one fan replied: "Don't do it riri!! Ur so beautiful the way you are."
