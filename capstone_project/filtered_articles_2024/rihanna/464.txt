Rihanna recently shared an Instagram video of herself rapping along to GloRilla’s “TGIF” on Friday (June 28). Ya’ll seen it? We did. Then things took a turn, albeit in good fun. 
Rihanna reached out to the Memphis star via IG DM with a playful question. Hmm, about her next project’s release date.
Rihanna kind of had the hilarious audacity to ask, “You got all summer sis! I know dis wild hypothetical, but when the album drop?” 
Fans, being overly sensitive fans, were a bit more concerned with the long gestating drop of Rihanna’s own album, R9, than that of Glo’s debut body of work.
ICYMI, back in June, Rihanna ignited excitement about her ninth studio album by wearing a T-shirt that read, “I’m Retired. This Is As Dressed Up As I Get.” Although it might have just been a vintage fashion statement, it led to speculation among fans. Rihanna later clarified to Extra, “They didn’t read the second line. I’m not retired, I’m just retired from dressing up — it’s a lot of effort.”
If you’re curious, the tee, according to Vogue, is from Peacock Papers, a brand known for its eye-catching slogans on apparel.
Get this, the 36-year-old told Entertainment Tonight that she’s “starting over” with her music. “I don’t want to neglect the songs that I have, so I actually want to go back and listen to stuff with new ears, with my new perspective and then see what applies and what I’m still in love with,” she explained.
She went on to add, “I think that music, for me, is a new discovery. I’m rediscovering things. I have been working on the album for so long that I kinda put all that stuff aside and now I’m prepared to go back in the studio. I’m gonna start. Give me a second!”
What ya’ll think, was Bad Gal RiRi being a playful, hypocritical or both? Lets us know.
