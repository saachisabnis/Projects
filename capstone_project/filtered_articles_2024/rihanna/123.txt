Just when we thought we’d seen every hair look possible from Rihanna, she brings back her iconic blonde hair. The change is a huge shock—especially because she just stepped out in Miami with bubblegum pink hair. Only a few days have passed since that bold hair transformation, and already, Rihanna’s blonde again. So far in 2024, the star has sported at least three different hair colors. And we’re not even halfway through the year yet. 
It’s clear Rihanna is no stranger to changing her hair color. She spent most of 2023 as a brunette, lightened her hair at the end of the year, and kicked off 2024 by going ginger in a Savage X campaign. After that, she sported an icy blonde updo. Then, she showed up with long blonde locks and bangs. And over the weekend, she brought back her iconic 2014 bubblegum pink hair—a change we thought would at least last the week.

But alas, we were wrong. Days later—right after sitting out this year’s Met Gala—Rihanna kept us on our toes and brought back her light hair again. While the initial debut of Rihanna’s icy blonde hair left us shook, we had no idea there were still so many more shocking looks to come. 
Last night, Rihanna stunned us with yet another blonde hair look—her ashy blonde hair is back and longer than ever. Styled straight with a side part, it might be her best blonde look yet. Even more shockingly, her blonde hair looks like she never dyed it pink. While such drastic overnight hair changes are common in Hollywood, Rihanna’s blonde locks look as pristine as they did when she first revealed them.
If we’re being honest, we knew better than to get used to Rih’s pink hair. While we were living for the long pink locks, we figured she’d debut another hair transformation at the 2024 Met Gala. At this point, it seems like we might’ve been right. While we’re not sure what Rihanna would’ve done with her hair at the event, if last night’s look is any indication, we assume blonde Rihanna would’ve been in full force. (Unless, of course, there was another new hair color in the works we never got to see.)
We’ll never truly know what Rihanna had in store for us, but the bubblegum pink locks over the weekend—and the long blonde hair now—makes us think Rihanna had a jaw-dropping blonde look planned for the 2024 Met Gala.

 









If there’s one thing Rihanna knows how to do, it’s reinvent her hair. On April 17, about a week after first donning blonde hair, the star arrived to the FENTY x PUMA launch party with long blonde locks and heavy Hannah Montana-esque bangs. She debuted pink hair a couple weeks later, but her latest hairstyle looks more like this one. 
Rihanna has kept us fed with so many blonde serves, but we can’t forget the look that started it all. She first debuted her icy blonde hair with the hottest hairstyle of the year—the Y2K prom updo. The curly updo has been seen on all the it girls, and it has us seriously nostalgic for all of the prom hairstyles of decades’ past. While Ariana Grande dressed up the hairstyle at the Oscars, Rihanna paired the updo with jeans and looked equally chic. 
From ginger, to blonde, to pink, and to blonde again—Rihanna doesn’t like to keep the same hair for too long. And while we know she’ll slay in practically any hair color, we do hope that she keeps the blonde inspo coming. (At least for a little longer.)
