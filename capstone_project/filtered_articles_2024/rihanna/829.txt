Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are couple goals, and we have the footage to prove it. 
The pair attended the 38th Footwear News Achievement Awards in New York City on Wednesday (December 4) night, per TMZ, and were "very loving with each other" at the event. 
Video footage captured by the outlet shows the world-renowned hitmakers sharing a hug, kiss, high five, and multiple laughs as they graced the awards and posed for pics on the red carpet. Rocky donned a black leather coat with a sherpa collar and matching black pants aside RiRi in a stunning white gown with pearl accessories. 
The "Sundress" rapper not only showed up and showed out in style next to the "Diamonds" songstress, but he also won the Collaboration of the Year Award for his creative vision with Puma. 
Rihanna and A$AP Rocky share sons RZA, 2, and Riot 1, and sparked relationship rumors in 2020 years after meeting. In October, Rocky spoke with W Magazine about parenting with his partner, sharing that he always knew RiRi was going to be the mother of his children. 
"I knew from when we were younger. We both did, I think. So it was only right when we got older. We just kind of reconnected."
Watch the couple shine at the annual Footwear News Achievement Awards below.
