Rihanna loves appearing in Savage x Fenty's advertising campaigns. After all, the multi-hyphenate owns the brand. So it isn't at all surprising to see Rihanna modeling her label's latest Valentine's Day collection in its new set of ads.
In the images posted to Instagram, Rihanna sports pieces from Savage x Fenty's new See Thru U line. But that's just the start of the brand's holiday lineup. There are slips, stockings and even comfortable sleepwear for after Valentine's Day is over. As usual, becoming a VIP will score you extra discounts on the hottest styles.
Savage x Fenty's new Valentine's Day collection is currently available on its website.
