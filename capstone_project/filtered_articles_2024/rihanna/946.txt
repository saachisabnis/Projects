“He got his mom’s forehead, but he got everything else from me,” the rapper joked. The interview, published Tuesday, was accompanied by stunning photos, with Rihanna herself behind the camera as the photographer.
A$AP Rocky’s playful comments gave fans a glimpse into his and Rihanna’s family life, showing how they’ve embraced parenthood with humor and affection. “I love my boy’s big forehead! I loved it on his mother,” Rocky said, even referencing his 2015 track “Jukebox Joints,” where he raps, “Ain’t nothing better than the pretty, big forehead bitch.”
Beyond their personal lives, both A$AP Rocky and Rihanna have experienced tremendous career growth. Rocky, known for hits like “Praise the Lord” and “Fashion Killa,” has evolved from being a Harlem rapper to a fashion icon and music mogul. Rihanna, once a pop sensation, has transitioned into a business powerhouse with her successful ventures like Fenty Beauty and Savage X Fenty. Together, they are a powerhouse couple, balancing high-profile careers and family life with charm and humor.
