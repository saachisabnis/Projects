A$AP Rocky opened up about his parenting style as he and girlfriend Rihanna raise their two sons together.
The rapper, 35, and his 36-year-old partner - who recently enjoyed a family vacation, have RZA, two, and Riot, one.
When a reporter noted the kids do not have the same kind of childhood he did growing up in Harlem, New York, the singer pushed back.
'Yes they do,' Rocky stated firmly in a Billboard video posted on TikTok.
That is when Rocky and the reporter engaged in a back and forth argument.

'Man, let me show you little RZA last night, bro. Look, this is my little man right here,' said A$AP.
'A$AP Rocky and Rihanna's kids aren't going to walk to a corner store in the middle of the night...' the reporter said before Rocky cut him off.
'Why the f*** not? the hitmaker asked.
'Because they're the kids of A$AP Rocky and Rihanna,' the reporter answered.¬†
'But they're still human,' the Good For You artist asserted. 'Like, they're human beings man. Look,' he said, displaying a video of RZA. 'This is him last night. He's walking to the corner store.'¬†
Later in the Billboard interview, the BET Award winner revealed the little ones don't have the same taste in music as mom and dad.
Right now, the tykes are fans of a popular kids' show called CoComelon.
The animated educational program contains lots of child-friendly songs that they like to listen to over and over.

'Don‚Äôt tell my girl I said that. I‚Äôm totally joking. I don‚Äôt give a s**t. She‚Äôs tired of it, too, probably.'

'HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY TO MY 2ND BORN SON RIOT ROSE MAYERS ‚ù§Ô∏è' the proud papa wrote next to a carousel of photos.¬†
The rapper, born¬†Rakim Mayers, said of his partner, 'It‚Äôs crazy how we find balance with our chaotic schedules.'
'I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a more perfect person because when the schedules are hectic, she‚Äôs very understanding of that,' he said. 'And when the schedule‚Äôs freed up, that‚Äôs when you get to spend [the] most time together. It‚Äôs all understanding and compatibility.'
