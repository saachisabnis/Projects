 Kristin Cavallari is feeling love while on vacation with boyfriend Mark Estes.

 Cavallari, 37, shared a series of videos of Estes, 24, while vacationing together in the Bahamas In a new TikTok, which was set to Rihanna and Casa Di's remix, “I’m in Love and I’m Obsessed.” 

 In the beginning of the clip, the Laguna Beach alum mouths the lyrics to the hit song, “I’m in love. I’m obsessed. And I don’t even feel guilty about it.”

 The video then shows Estes barbequing in a tank top, which shows off his tattooed arms, before he ditched the shirt completely in the second clip. The third was a sweet moment of him playing cards with one of Cavallari’s sons.

 The Uncommon James founder also posted a series of photos to her Instagram account that chronicles her trip to the Bahamas with Estes and her three kids — sons Camden, 11, and Jaxon, 10, and daughter Saylor, 8, whom she shares with ex-husband Jay Cutler.

 "Bahamas with my favorite people 🇧🇸 ☀️," the Hills alum wrote in the caption, alongside photos of herself and Estes sharing a kiss on a boat, the family playing with wild pigs on a beach, herself and the kids relaxing on the same boat and Cavallari sitting in Estes lap.

 Estes is known for being a part of the TikTok group “Montana Boyz,” an account where he and his friends post thirst traps and videos being cowboys in Montana. He recently ended his college football career at Montana Tech Orediggers in November 2023, and now splits his time between Montana and Nashville, where Cavallari lives.

 "We love it. [We] support it. It’s been fun," Montana Boyz member Kade Wilcox told PEOPLE in March, with Kaleb Winterburn adding, "It's been fun meeting her and getting to know her and just everything about that whole world, too. It's cool to see.”

 Now with 849,000 followers on their TikTok, the boys said their account has blown up following Estes and Cavallari’s public relationship.

 “It all kind of happened in the right time, but since that's happened, yeah, it's been a complete shift,” Winterburn told PEOPLE. “I think more people are curious about what we're doing — different age ranges, different everybody. It's just from her…. what she's done before. I think it's sweet to see all those other people that are curious about what we're trying to do.”

 Estes met Cavallari through the DMs, admitting he accidentally sent the message from the Montana Boyz account instead of his own.

 “Yeah, I thought I was on my own account and I DMed her,” Estes admitted. “We woke up the next day and [my friend] was like, ‘Who DM'd Kristin?’ I was like, ‘Oh, that was me.’”

 Cavallari shared the story on her podcast, with co-host Justin Anderson poking fun at her acting like a “little high school girl.”

 “I get a DM on Instagram from the Montana Boyz that just says ‘I love you.’ And I’m going, ‘Oh, my God!’ ” Cavallari recalled.
