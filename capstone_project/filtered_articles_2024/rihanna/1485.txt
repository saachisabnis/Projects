Rihanna‘s got jokes when it comes to her fans awaiting new music, trolling them during a recent outing with a bold message about retirement.
The superstar mogul was spotted out with A$AP Rocky in New York City on Thursday (June 6), rocking a top that read, “I’m retired.”

In smaller print, it also said, “This is as dressed up as I get.”
The Rihanna Navy has not gotten a new album from their fave since 2016’s ANTI, as she’s been focused on building both her beauty empire and her family – having welcomed two children in the last two years.

All hope is not lost, however, as Rihanna shed more light on her upcoming ninth album in an April interview with Entertainment Tonight at the launch party for her FENTY x Puma Creeper Phatty Earth Tone sneaker in London.
After being asked if her children, RZA and Riot, will be featured on the record, Rihanna offered up some exciting news.

“I mean, it’s up to them,” she said. “I already got stuff that I feel like I can make hits out of. Me and Rocky are really trying to figure out who’s gonna use what because it’s so good!”
When asked about the visuals for the as-yet-untitled album, Rihanna kept mum: “I can’t tell you! That would be me, like, snitching on my record.”

Earlier that month, she spoke about her creative process while making the album and explained how her approach differs compared to previous projects.
“I have a lot of visual ideas,” she told Interview magazine. “It’s weird. My brain is working backward right now. I usually have the music first, and the music leads me into all of these visual opportunities, and now I’m having all of these visuals.

“I don’t have the songs for them yet, but maybe that’s the key, this time. Maybe the visual ideas are leading me to the songs that I need to make.”
When asked if the album will be a “rebirth” for her, she replied: “Random ideas, quirky ideas, things that have nothing to do with me at all. I mean, I can’t tell you. The opps is watching.”
