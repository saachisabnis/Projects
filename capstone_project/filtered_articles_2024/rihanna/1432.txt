Rihanna knows how to turn heads through her style and shoes, and her ensemble for the 2024 Fashion Awards on Dec. 2 in London, England was no different. The Fenty Beauty founder was in attendance wearing Saint Laurent heels to support her partner A$AP Rocky, who is set to receive the Cultural Innovator Award on behalf of the British Fashion Council Foundation.
The singer popped on the red carpet at the event wearing a teal wide brimmed hat and a turquoise blue fur dress, which was Christian Lacroix Fall/Winter 2002 Couture. As a true fashion girl, Rihanna knows accessories are the keys to putting together the right look and paired the look with stacked diamond necklaces that danced around her chest, bringing attention to the deep cut of her dress. She added a pair of black leather gloves, black sheer tights and Saint Laurent’s Harlow pumps on her feet. She was styled by Jahleel Weaver.

The shoes are made from black satin crepe and feature a large crystal in the center. The heel features a flared heel, pointed toe, and low-cut vamp, and an ankle wrapped strap with a giant crystal ornament at the center bringing all the straps together. A 4.3 inch heel brings it all together. The YSL shoe currently retails for $ 1,490. Keke Palmer recently wore the same shoe for an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
Rocky kept it cool in a deeper shade of blue, wearing an oversized navy blue suit, orange tie and square toe dress shoes.
Rihanna is no stranger to the event since she attended when she won the “Urban Luxe” award for her eponymous Fenty label in 2019. The fundraiser, which was presented by Pandora this year, takes place at the Royal Albert Hall in London and celebrates designers in the womenswear and menswear world for their work each year.
“We are thrilled to honour A$AP Rocky with the Cultural Innovator Award tonight. Rocky has had a resounding impact on the creative industries and popular culture this year – from his Paris Fashion Week debut to designing the retro futuristic neighbourhood in the Moncler’s The City of Genius in Shanghai,” Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council. “Through these collections and the promotion of his upcoming album ‘Don’t Be Dumb’, he has firmly positioned himself at the intersection of culture and innovation. We are also incredibly grateful for his continued support of UK designers and retail.” 

 









Rocky is on a winning streak this week. A$AP Rocky x Puma will receive this year’s Collaboration of the Year award at the FN Achievement Awards on Dec. 4. The celebrated rapper will accept the award during the FNAA red carpet and gala event on Dec. 4 at Cipriani South Street in New York.
“We’ve been working hard together on developing product that speaks to me and my culture and blurs the lines between motorsport, streetwear and fashion,” A$AP Rocky told FN. “It’s been an exciting challenge, and I’m really happy with how my designs and creative interpretations have come to life. Puma has given me the keys to push the boundaries, and I’m immensely grateful for their trust. This is just the beginning.”
