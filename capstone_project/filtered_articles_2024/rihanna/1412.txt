Haters say she didn’t “work, work, work.”
Rihanna has been panned for her “lazy” and “boring” performance at a pre-wedding bash for Indian billionaire Anant Ambani— despite reports she was paid over $6 million for the 90-minute appearance. 
The “S.O.S” singer, 36, took to the stage at the lavish event in Jamanagar, India on Friday, performing in front of some of the world’s richest and most powerful people. 
Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Ivanka Trump are among the attendees who have jetted into the city for the festivities. 
Ambani, 28, is youngest son of India’s biggest business tycoon, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani. 
He is set to marry long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant in July.
Videos of Rihanna performing at the pre-wedding event have gone viral, with the superstar mercilessly mocked for seemingly doing the bare minimum. 
“She just don’t give a f–k,” a critic wrote on X, before a second sassed: “Ri is the laziest performer ever! Even Taylor swift brings more energy.”
“She got that coin and said ‘F–k y’all ima do what I can,'” another chimed in.
Another described her as a “scammer,” saying she was over-paid and under-performing. 
At the party, Rihanna sang a medley of her famous hits, including “Umbrella, “We Found Love,” “Stay,” “Rude Boy,” “Diamonds” and “Work.” 
“I’m here tonight in honor of Anant and Radhika. Thank you for having me here. God bless your union. I wish you all the best. Congratulations,” the Fenty Beauty CEO gushed to the couple on stage.
Ambani’s father has a current net worth of $113 billion, and is the head of the company, Reliance Industries.
The pre-wedding party is a three-day event and is set to continue on into Monday, March 4. According to the Daily Mail, the event cost over $120 million.
But it doesn’t seem Rihanna is sticking around for the entirety of the festivities. 
On Saturday, the “Ocean’s 8” actress was spotted departing from Jamnagar Airport less than 24 hours after her performance.
