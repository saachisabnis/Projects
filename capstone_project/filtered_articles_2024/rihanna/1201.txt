Stephen A. Smith revealed that Jay-Z hit him up over commentary he made about Rihanna before her NFL Super Bowl Halftime performance. 
While on the ‘Connect The Dots’ podcast, Smith said Jiggaman called him after his comments. Smith’s comments found him saying, “I love Rihanna. I bought her album, she gets my money. Mad love for her, wish her nothing but the best … But you do know there’s only one Beyonce.”
In another part of the interview, Smith said, “A month later, Hov and I were on the phone. Hov was like, ‘My dawg, you family, that’s family. That’s too close to say that.’ I said, ‘I didn’t know.’ He said, ‘I know.’ Done! In other words, it’s a business, it’s a part of it, you don’t know how she’ll receive it, etc. etc. etc. That’s all he had to say. I appreciated that.”
