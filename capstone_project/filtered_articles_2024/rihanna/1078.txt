Who is on the confirmed guest list for the Met Gala 2024? Here's everyone who has been invited, is attending and all the rumours explained.
The Met Gala 2024 is upon us and speculation about who might be attending is truly starting to ramp up.
An Instagram post featuring an alleged list of 'confirmed Met Gala guests' has started to circulate on social media, including the likes of Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift, Timothée Chalamet, Kylie Jenner, Pedro Pascal, Zendaya and Tom Holland. 
While some of those names are already 100% confirmed (Zendaya is one of the co-chairs), some might be unlikely. Tom, for example, will probably be in intense final rehearsals for his upcoming West End play ahead of the first performance on May 11th. Olivia Rodrigo also has a show in Glasgow the day after the Met Gala. Jared Leto, who appears on the viral list, has also confirmed he is not attending. 
Taylor's Eras Tour also kicks back off in Paris on May 9th, and it's been reported that she'll be skipping the event to rehearse for the show. 
Every year, Anna Wintour selects a group of celebrity co-chairs who will help host the event on the night. For the 2024 Met Gala, those co-chairs are: 
Ben Affleck will likely attend alongside Jennifer Lopez, and Elsa Pataky will likely join Chris Hemsworth on the red carpet. As mentioned above, a Tom Holland appearance might be unlikely. 
Zendaya admits she doesn’t know what she’s doing as Met Gala co-chair
Every year, Vogue gathers a small group of celebrities, internet personalities, fashion lovers and influencers to host their red carpet and social media coverage. Here's who will be hosting Vogue's livestream and red carpet interviews this year:
Confirmations about who will be there begin to trickle in on the day of the event, as celebrities and designers begin to share sneak peaks of the looks and their muses on social media. Plenty of celebs have already been spotted at The Carlyle Hotel – a popular hotel for guests of the event – in New York, too. 
Queen of the Met Gala herself, Rihanna, has confirmed her attendance. Speaking to Extra, Rihanna teased: "I'm actually just keeping it real simple this year... Very simple... I think it's gonna come to what my makeup and what my hair is going to do. We wanna play with that, but I have no idea what I'm gonna do with that."
Here's who has been confirmed for the Met Gala 2024 so far:
Plenty of rumours about who might attend are already circulating... Beyoncé might be there, but for those hoping to see Blue Ivy, she's sadly too young to attend. 
The former Met Gala attendees such as Jessica Chastain and Jared Leto have already ruled out their appearance. Various people have reported that Bella Hadid is unlikely to appear.
And the jury is still out Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. As mentioned above, Taylor resumes her Eras Tour in Paris on May 9th and may have opted to rehearse instead of attend the event.
