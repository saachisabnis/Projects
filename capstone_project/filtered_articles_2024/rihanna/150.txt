On Saturday night, the Friends of the Carnegie Library of Homestead will put on a night of laughs for a good cause at the Munhall venue.

The third annual “Comedy at the Carnegie” benefit will be headlined by Mark Eddie and hosted by Aaron Kleiber, with a slate of local comedians to keep the giggles going.

Kleiber, a Steel Valley native, wanted to get involved to raise money for educational and community programs at the Carnegie Library of Homestead.

“The Carnegie Library of Homestead is where I grew up,” he said in a phone interview.

A few years ago, the Friends of the Carnegie Library of Homestead, a nonprofit that raises money to benefit the library, approached him about doing a comedy fundraiser in the spring. The event has been a success for the past two years, and it’s back this Saturday for year three.

Donna Tomasic, president of the Friends of the Carnegie Library of Homestead, said that the event raises about $10,000 a year for the library.

“Our main mission is to support the library by raising funds and providing volunteer services,” she said. “The library gives us a list of their needs.” The funds they raise go towards classes and educational programs, as well as equipment and material needs, even items as simple as chairs and iPad covers. They fund programs for people of all ages.

Mark Eddie, a Steubenville native, will be headlining the event this year. “He’s been doing comedy for 25 years. He bills himself as a rock comedian,” Kleiber said. “He brings a guitar onstage, and he makes fun of music anywhere from Buddy Holly to Rihanna.”

“He’s unbelievable,” he added.

Kleiber also always makes sure to get local comedians on the bill. Every year, fellow Steel Valley alumnus Brian Linsenbigler performs. This year, he and Eddie are joined by Tyler Ray Kendrick, who was voted Pittsburgh Magazine’s Best Comedian in 2022 and 2023.

“I’ve won five times, he’s won twice, so he’s gaining on me,” Kleiber joked.

Chrissy Costa will also perform.

“People may know her, they’ve seen her all over the city … she’s super funny,” Kleiber said. He will be hosting the evening himself. “I’m just excited to bring an incredibly talented lineup every year.”

The benefit is billed as “17 and over” but Kleiber promises it “won’t be crazy.” It will feature a cash bar, basket raffles, a 50/50 raffle and “local tastings and baked goods.”

The general admission tickets are $25 and proceeds go to the Friends of the Carnegie Library of Homestead. For those who can’t make it to Saturday’s show, “regrets donations” are also available.

There will be a 6 p.m. pre-show mixer and seating in the music hall will open at about 6:45 p.m. The show will begin at 7:30 p.m.

Both Kleiber and Tomasic emphasized the importance of the Carnegie Library of Homestead to the area.

“The library itself is like the heartbeat of the community,” she added.
