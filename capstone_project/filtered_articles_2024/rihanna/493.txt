The Top Boy star, 31, and the U.S. skateboarder 33, whom she's been dating since 2021, announced the happy news to Instagram on Wednesday. 
Uploading photos during her emergency cesarean birth, Adwoa revealed the couple had welcomed a baby girl, who they have named Shy Trinity Afua Wheatley.
The new mum captioned her photos: 'Our stunner of a daughter was born at 11:22pm on the 23rd of August by emergency cesarean. 
'Our hearts have literally exploded into a million pieces. Shy Trinity Afua Wheatley. What the f**k'.'
Adwoa Aboah has welcomed her first child with her boyfriend Daniel Wheatley
The Top Boy star, 31, and the U.S. skateboarder 33, whom she's been dating since 2021, announced the happy news to Instagram on Wednesday 
Adwoa and US-based skater and videographer Daniel keep their romance low-key, sharing the odd cosy snaps of one another on birthdays and just special occasions.
Daniel is also a member of the editorial teams on Thrasher Magazine and The Perfect Magazine.
In 2021, she told Daily Mail: 'I’ve always wanted to go out with a long-legged skater.' 
Adwoa announced her pregnancy with her first child by appearing at this year's Met Gala with a baby bump.
The Top Boy star drew attention to her blossoming bump in a red balloon skirt and matching crop top for the glitzy fashion night in New York City. 
Rather than slip into a big budget designer gown, Adwoa took inspiration from an iconic high street brand, as she showed off her bump in a red ruffled crop top from H&M.
The top comprised a capelet in fiery red silk organza, its tulle ruffles resembling petals, worn over a bralette delicately embroidered with rhinestones.
Adwoa's look was paired with a voluminous bubble-hem skirt in red silk taffeta, lending an effortlessly modern edge to this charm-infused confection.

Speaking about her outfit choice, Adwoa said: 'My Met Gala looks are always very instinctive.
'I love leaning into the theme, but I always want to feel completely like myself with the confidence to stand out from the rest.'
The beauty added: 'We created a look to mark a very special moment in my life.'
She joked to Harper's Bazaar just a few days before the event: 'I’m gonna do my Rihanna reveal moment, whatever that looks like … and then I’ll probably go back into hiding.'
Adwoa later told the publication: 'I wanted to feel like my best self, and it’s hard when you have literally no control over your body and the way that it’s moving and growing and doing its own thing.
'I did a lot of research on pregnant women on the red carpet. Obviously, we have the likes of Rihanna, who killed it in such an incredible way. Sienna [Miller] was also a big reference for me.' 
The actress has been open about her difficult past and problems with alcohol and drugs, previously recounting how she first tried marijuana at the age of 14 after getting drunk at a house party.
From then on, she started using harder drugs, trying both cocaine and ketamine, with the latter being the drug which 'really got' her.

Last year, Adwoa revealed she was 'pushed to rip apart myself and put it all back together' while in a treatment facility for her drug addiction.
She added that she is 'lucky' to be sober and go to treatment as it forced her to confront herself and her addiction issues.
Speaking on the Reign With Josh Smith podcast for World Mental Health Day, she said: 'I was lucky enough to go to treatment, so I met a mad variety of people there who'd been through all sorts of different things.
'It kicks it out of you when you are forced to really confront yourself. I'm actually quite lucky. A lot of sober people say that. I think I'm quite lucky that I was pushed to deal with it now.
'Pushed to pick apart any judgments I had towards other people. Pushed to rip apart myself and put it all back together so that I could look at things a bit differently.
'Even though it was pretty f***ing s**t, I'm pretty lucky to be quite honest that I've been given this chance to do things differently and to look at situations in a more empathetic way, actually.'

Adwoa wants to use her platform to raise awareness for mental health and admitted: 'I've resigned myself to the fact that life is just so messy and one's mental health journey couldn't be further from linear.
'So the fact is it's just ebbs and flows and we find ways of dealing with things and then we're confronted with another thing, whether it be grief or identity or love or sex, it's endless.
'I think because our stories change and evolve, and we grow so our perspective on things changes, and it's so mad that you can look at a situation that happened a few years ago and then with some age and wisdom you suddenly reframe it and you're like, "Okay maybe it was my fault".
'Or maybe there are different ways that we can look at things, I think that comes with age definitely. I've started really putting into place those boundaries and knowing what's good for me and what is not good for me.'
