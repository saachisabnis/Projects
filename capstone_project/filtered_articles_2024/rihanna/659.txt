Comedian Luenell recently shared her thoughts in an interview about Tiffany Haddish's DUI and addressed her recent foray into adult content on OnlyFans. Commenting on Haddish's DUI charges, she expressed concern, asserting that DUIs are serious, embarrassing, costly, and potentially dangerous. She hopes Haddish will successfully navigate the situation. Luenell also touched on her decision to stop posting on OnlyFans. Despite reaping financial benefits from the platform, she said the risqu√© photos were never her end goal. Luenell clarified that she's quitting due to her primary income being from her standup comedy, lacking need for the supplemental income from OnlyFans. Furthermore, shifting from the matter of OnlyFans, she humorously recounted times of having been asked to model for Rihanna. She admitted to initially being apprehensive, but eventually conceded, playfully attributing it to Rihanna's persuasive influence and status.
