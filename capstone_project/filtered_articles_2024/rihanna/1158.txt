JAY-Z isn’t completely rejecting the opportunity to one day perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show.
In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, the founder of Roc Nation — the company producing the Halftime Show since 2019 — briefly explained that he didn’t want to come off as egotistic if he chose himself as the performer right after taking on the project. “I don’t know, I thought it would be selfish to pick myself too early,” Hov shared. “Maybe one year. Maybe.”
Despite the uncertainty, he publicly shared his excitement about Usher’s upcoming Halftime Show performance this February and even gave the artist his flowers, ”I think he’s gonna take his rightful place. He’s one of the greatest performers we’ve seen in our time, and I think he’ll take his rightful place.”
Although JAY never performed a Halftime Show, he did perform before the Super Bowl in 2011 which gave him the Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition/Direction/Lyrics for “Run This Town (Live at Super Bowl XLIV).” He also just won the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special alongside Hamish Hamilton for Rihanna’s 2023 Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show.
