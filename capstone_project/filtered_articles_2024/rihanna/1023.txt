“Water” hitmaker Tyla has confirmed she is in talks with BLACKPINK’s Lisa for a collaboration.
After teasing fans that the pair are “definitely” going to work together “down the line,” Tyla spilled the news that they have been discussing teaming up on a song.
The singer had posted a clip of her and the K-pop star goofing around while listening to “Art,” from Tyla’s self-titled debut album, which came out last week.
“Sweetest gorllll, played her some of my favorite songs on the album … Definitely a LISA x TYLA collab down the line,” Tyla captioned her Instagram Story video.
“We’ve been speaking about making a song together, so yes, for sure,” she told Reuters.
The viral star — who teamed up with Travis Scott for a remix of her breakthrough hit “Water” —  also wants to work with rap superstar Drake and has vowed to become “the biggest pop star” of her generation.
“It feels like it happened very quickly. Whenever I get a new DM, I’m shocked. It doesn’t feel real yet. But I want to be the biggest pop star of my generation. That’s always been the goal, and it still is. And I really want to work with Drake. I’m going to say that in every single interview until he makes it happen,” she said to Trevor Noah for Interview.
The Grammy-nominated South African star says Barbadian superstar Rihanna’s success story made her believe her “dream was achievable.”
“I do remember loving the story of Rihanna because she came from outside of America. It made me feel like my dream was achievable because, like you said, it’s not something that happens every day for us. My whole family wanted to be stars and it didn’t happen for them,” Tyla said of the “Work” hitmaker.
