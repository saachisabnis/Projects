Rihanna is gearing up for fashion’s biggest night on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
However, the singer and fashion and cosmetics mogul — known as the big closer of the widely watched red carpet festivities – promises that her outfit this year won’t be as over-the-top as in previous years.
“I’m actually just keeping it real simple this year. Very simple,” she revealed to Extra. “I think it’s gonna come to what my makeup and what my hair is going to do. We wanna play with that, but I have no idea what I’m gonna do with that.”
In the past, Rihanna’s show-stopping looks included a Christian Louboutin Pope-inspired ensemble in 2018, and 2015’s flowing yellow robe designed by Chinese couture designer Guo Pei that was lampooned for resembling an omelet.
Last year, the Bajan billionaire was pregnant and donned a white floral hooded Valentino gown, with her baby daddy A$AP Rocky by her side.  The appearance was a few months before the birth of the couple’s second child, Riot Rose.
The 2024 Met Gala’s theme, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, is inspired by the Costume Institute’s 33,000-piece garment collection, which will be exhibited from May 10 to Sept. 2.
The dress code for the event presided over by Vogue editor Anna Wintour is defined as “The Garden of Time.”
Zendaya,  Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez were previously announced as co-chairs for the event which raised funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute.
