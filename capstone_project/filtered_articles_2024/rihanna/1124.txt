Rihanna is making family time fashionable in the new Savage x Fenty holiday campaign, where she stars alongside her sons, RZA, 2, and Riot, 14 months. The Grammy-winning artist and business mogul introduced her brand’s latest holiday pieces with an intimate family portrait on Instagram. The images, showcasing her family decked out in the new “Forever Savage” onesies, give fans a heartwarming glimpse into their holiday preparations.
Rihanna’s post revealed her playful side, captioning the photos with a relatable message: “Yea I know! We are officially one of those families that match for the holidays.” The singer posed alongside RZA and Riot on a gold bed with cheetah-print sheets, all three donning cozy onesies in the collection’s festive blue and green “Holly Daze” print. Each family member wore a version of the Forever Savage Hooded Onesie, available in children’s, toddler, and adult sizes.
Throughout the photos, Rihanna keeps it cozy yet chic. She sports the brand’s signature onesie with hair rollers, adding a touch of mom-life humor to the shoot. In one touching shot, she wraps her arms around her two little ones as they teethe on toys, while another shows her kissing Riot on the cheek. Fans were quick to celebrate the family-first focus of the campaign, with one follower commenting, “This is the real holiday spirit!”
The Savage x Fenty brand has quickly become a staple in Rihanna’s personal life. Recently, she spoke with PEOPLE about her go-to “mom uniform,” emphasizing her preference for comfortable, stretchy fabrics. “Anything that’s cozy, anything that’s easy to bend down and pick my kids up in,” Rihanna explained. She’s often celebrated for pushing fashion boundaries, whether she’s designing intricate lingerie or creating laid-back pieces for every day.
The Forever Savage Hooded Onesie is now available on the Savage x Fenty website, with prices from $49.95 to $94.95. As Rihanna prepares to launch the full holiday collection on November 1, she’s proving that family and fashion can go hand-in-hand, just in time for the holiday season.
