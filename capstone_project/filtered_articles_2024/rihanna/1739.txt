A$AP Rocky and Rihanna have made headlines after sneaking in a visit with French president Emmanuel Macron during the latter part of their most recent trip to Paris.
PEOPLE was able to catch the couple as they left the Élysée Palace on Wednesday (January 24). The reason for their meeting wasn’t clear, but it wasn’t the power couple’s first sit down with Macron.

“Rihanna previously met with Macron in July 2017 to discuss the country’s international education funding,” PEOPLE reported. “The meeting occurred a month after she publicly reached out to him on X, formerly known as Twitter, about his support for the cause.”
Rihanna also met with Macron in 2018 to raise money for education in Dakar, Senegal.
Earlier this month, A$AP Rocky officially entered a not-guilty plea related to two felony charges of assault with a semi-automatic firearm.
The plea, which was entered in a Los Angeles, CA courtroom on January 8 during his arraignment, was necessary because a judge ruled that there was enough evidence to warrant a trial based on an alleged 2021 shootout after he’d gotten into an argument with fellow A$AP Mob member A$AP Relli.

Rocky’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina — who is also currently defending Donald Trump in New York, for charges relating to the ex-president’s alleged falsifying of business documents — told Rolling Stone that his client is “confident” he’ll be vindicated.
Tacopina also said that the “Praise the Lord” rapper (real name Rakim Mayers) is looking forward to getting home to his family, including the two children he shares with Rihanna.

“He’s a very strong character, a very strong individual,” Tacopina said.
Rocky is accused of shooting at former friend A$AP Relli during a “heated argument” in Hollywood in 2021. According to Relli, tensions between the two ignited after Rocky allegedly promised to help the family of a deceased member of the A$AP Mob, but never did.
Relli (real name Tyrell Ephron) is also suing A$AP Rocky and his lawyer Joe Tacopina for defamation, alleging the attorney of launching a media campaign against him that paints him as a liar.
