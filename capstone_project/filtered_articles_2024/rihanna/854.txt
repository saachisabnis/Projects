In a campaign video showcasing a variety of hair types and textures (including Rih's shaggy blonde pixie cut), the Fenty Beauty founder, 36, gives fans a sneak peek into her newest product line.
"A new family is moving in!" the star, 36, wrote in the caption. "@fentyhair is pullin up and it’s time to finally have the hair experience you’ve been waiting for."
The "Diamonds" singer went on to explain that Fenty Hair will focus on reparative formulas that work for all hair types.

 "You know how much switching my hair up matters to me," she continued. "I’ve had almost every texture, color, length, from weaves to braids to natural — so I am launching a flexible line of products for not only every hair want, but every single product is designed to strengthen and repair all types of hair, which is what we truly need! It’s time to play and get stronger by the style 💁🏿‍♀️"
