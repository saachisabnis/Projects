“Texas Hold ‘Em” is a certified hit for Beyoncé. It’s looking to be her biggest hit since I Am Sasha Fierce. Wouldn’t be surprised if this is her ticket to a ROTY win.

 Adele still performs exceptionally well, she just needs better work ethics. 800k+ debut, 3x platinum, super hit and great reviews in an artist’s flop era is outstanding. She’s not business savvy at all which is bloody annoying. Swift & Beyonce made the best out of Super Bowls but Adele was nowhere. She’s practically dragging herself to oblivion with the sparse activity. 21 & 25 were released in my teens with 30 in my mid 20s. That was a massive gap from my perspective and I got to love Bruno then. Honestly, I’m practically forcing myself to remain a fan at this point, and I loose that eagerness for her return each passing day. No tour, no merch, no music, no feature, no side project, no appearances. Swift, Beyonce, Drake etc are acquiring new fans from Gen Alpha with new strategies while its the same old us for Adele who she barely maintains. Horrible management, terrible release strategies. Just some long distance residency of which the opportunity to attend was taken from me. I’m already over Kendrick & Rihanna, Adele will be next if she waits all these years just to drop another album I don’t feel. ***Deep breath*** Ok, I’m done venting now. 
She doesn’t care about the records and accolades. She released 1 album in the last 8 years and she’s not releasing a new album anytime soon, I’d be surprised if she releases before 2027. The blame is on her, not on her management and marketing. She doesn’t have the drive, motivation and  work ethic and that’s fine. She achieved so much with 2 albums, who can blame her.</p>

 I don’t see it. Yeah it’s a hit but it’s nothing special overall. This will be her Break My Sou/Formation/Black Parade GF nomination. This year is gonna be stacked and I doubt that it’s gonna stay relevant for the whole year. It’s not even a smash hit. Flowers, Kill Bill, Anti Hero were pulling much bigger weekly streaming numbers than Texas and had insane longevity. We have so many new releases ahead of us, Im sure that its streams are gonna start declining soon

Adele needs not only better business savvy, she needs a reinvention. She doesn’t have the youth appeal of Taylor or Beyoncé. People get bored with “ballad queens” over time. I still think 30 is a better album than 25 and maybe 21, but I was mildly disappointed by the limits of that supposed reinvention. However, perhaps she doesn’t want to have that type of gravitas and broad appeal. Her success wasn’t as carefully calculated as Taylor or Beyoncé. Perhaps it’s not her ambition. I’m in the same boat with Doja Cat. She had potential to be easily the biggest star of her generation but got addicted to being a messy “rebel” and also clearly got scared of a how big she was becoming. And we all saw what happened to someone like Britney Spears. That level of years long pop star domination and pop culture omnipresence isn’t meant for everyone. Even Beyoncé scaled back. I think Billie has also become more careful about being too seen and too pop culture immersed. Adele clearly has a comfort zone as far as her creativity, her image and how much she wants to work.

Yes!! It’s quickly becoming her biggest hit in YEARS! So excited. 
Texas Hold ‘Em will have cross genre appeal. I can see pop and R&B voters voting for it. That’s the main advantage it’ll have.

None of these were huge hits like that. Texas is about to top the Hot 100 and it’s probably gonna be there for a couple weeks just based on how it’s gaining. Plus, like M said, it’s got mass cross-genre appeal. 
I would have to see how well the Billie would perform, but Beyoncé could pull a Flowers if Texas Hold ‘Em becomes a stable hit for multiple weeks this year.

This area is more marketable to white general audiences, and I think the fact that we have been WAITING for Beyoncé to get some love for AOTY,ROTY, and SOTY would make me believe that it’s going have the momentum to win at least one general field award. However I need to see how well Billie, Dua, and most importantly Taylor does to challenge Bey for AOTY
Also sounds crazy but I feel like 16 Carriages should be Beyoncé submission for SOTY. I feel like Grammy now do care about the ROTY/SOTY, and Texas Hold ‘Em in reality is giving Break My Soul 2.0 in terms of songwriting. However, I prefer 16 Carriages, and I know Beyoncé will already be nominated regardless of what song she submits, but to go and win, I feel like lyrically and compositionally, 16 Carriages is the better song imo

Yeah Beyonce always gets GF nominations even for “flops” but she’s never competitive in ROTY/SOTY. Texas will be more competitive but I just dont see it doing that good in the long run. I think that it’s gonna get overshadowed by new releases. It’s doing good but not that good if you know what I mean. It’s doing great numbers for her standards but it’s not even the biggest song WW, its Spotify numbers are quite similar to Carnival by Kanye. January and February are perfect months for new singles cuz there is no competition but yeah I don’t see Texas becoming this mega smash that would be one of the defining songs of 2024.
Formation was not competitive in 2017 but I think if the song and its music video came out a few years later or in the BLM era she could easily win ROTY/SOTY (like Gambino and HER). Formation was the OG “This Is America”, it was actually a huge moment when jt was released, she sabotaged and ruined its chart success tho since it wasn’t available on all streaming platforms. Grammys were way more white and less progressive in 2016 and Formation just wasn’t a part of any real momevent, well it was very important for the black community but that’s it. If Formation came out during the Floyd protests and if it wasn’t a TIDAL exclusive it could easily win ROTY and SOTY cuz of the narrative. I know she released “Black Parade” in 2020 but that song was a non event, it was way weaker and no one really cared about that song tbh
Honey, Adele is NOT thirsty like Beyoncé and Taylor Shit.  Adele releases music when she wants to.  Adele does NOT give a shit about chart success.  Adele is NOT trying to appeal to this fucked up social media era.  Gucci can go on and on…

Beyoncé will still have to deal with SZA who just dropped Saturn track. But it would be dope for Beyonce to get ROTY although I love Texas Hold ‘Em track.

I beg to disagree over all of these points. Completely subjective, sorry.
The song is actually growing on streaming as each day goes by. It did 4M on its first day and just did 6M yesterday, a whole two weeks after – keep in mind that Act II is a month away (and album releases always boosts pre-singles, in special the track 1, which is the case for “Texas”).
This “no competition in January and February” type of thing is just… silly excuse. Just look at how Ariana released her supposedly highly anticipated lead single with this very same perspective and, well… this one is actually plummeting as we speak.
The GP really said yes “This ain’t Texas” and “ain’t no hold ’em”. And, given its cross-genre appeal, which is a big factor among voters (and maybe with Columbia playing the cards right this time), it’s an actual competitive ROTY.
I don’t think it’s winning tho

Beyoncé will still have to face off against Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus and even Vampire Weekend who are in Columbia Records.
