Chris Brown found himself under fire this week after a seemingly innocent meme he posted led to fans bringing up his domestic violence incident with Rihanna.
Taking to his Instagram Story on Thursday (March 21), the singer shared a meme that read: “Dating me is fun. You get a comedian, mental patient and a pornstar all in one.”

When The Neighborhood Talk shared his post, however, all hell broke loose in the comments.
“Might even get an asz whooping,” one person wrote, while another added: “He forgot boxer.” A third person added: “He forgot, a punch and coke.”

Not all the comments were negative, however. Some laughed at how much of a ‘Taurus thing’ it was to share the sentiments of the meme, while others noted things among the likes of “i love you christopher maurice brown” and “where do I sign up.”
See the Neighborhood Talk post below:
While he’s many years removed from moment with Rihanna in 2009, and she has since forgiven him, Chris Brown is still affected by it in other ways outside of social media. In February, he claimed that the NBA disinvited him from the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game after receiving pushback from the event’s sponsors.
The singer took to his IG Stories to detail his exclusion from the event. “I was asked by the NBA to play in the all star game this year! Only for them to call later and say they couldn’t do IT because of their sponsors like RUFFLES,” he wrote. “At this point I’m sick of people bothering me and I’m tired of living in the fucking past. I POSTED THE EMAILS SO YALL COULD SEE. The NBA still was tryna get me to come and sit court side…NOT FUCKING HAPPENING.”

Activist Tamika Mallory commented on the situation on Instagram, defending the corporation and also asking whether Chris Brown deserves a second chance.
“On this issue…brands have every right to choose who they do or don’t want to work with in situations surrounding domestic violence, sexual assault etc etc…,” she wrote. “I have questions for our community…especially our women. Does there come a point when a younger person who did something wrong gets to move forward or do we hold them to their actions forever?”
