Styling underwear as outerwear is one of the more risqué fads to hit the trend cycle over the past few years, with everyone from Dakota Johnson to Kristen Stewart offering up their own takes. But, there is perhaps no better champion of the trend than the lingerie mogul herself: Rihanna.
On Thursday, the superstar showed us how the trend is done by visiting Savage x Fenty’s Lavish Lace collection debut at Nordstrom in Los Angeles. For the occasion, she wore a slate gray bustier made out of floral mesh, coordinated with matching gray lace tights.
She kicked it up a notch with the non-lingerie elements of her outfit, including black heeled sandals with bedazzled criss-crossing straps and a gigantic shag coat with tiers of multi-colored brown and burgundy fur.
Beauty-wise, Rihanna styled her chin-length bob in slick, wet mermaid waves. She wore a shimmery champagne eyeshadow with a smoked out cat eye, plus glossy brown lipliner.
At the event, the “Love on the Brain” singer talked about her love for the lingerie trend in an interview with People.
“Lingerie to me should be worn any way and anywhere that you want,” she told the outlet. “Whether you want it to be seen on display outside of T-shirts, inside a jacket falling off, or just to be cozy or just to have a little support.”
But, when it comes to dressing up at home, the mom of two revealed that she tends to opt for more relaxed outfits. “Anything that's cozy, anything that's stretchy, anything that's easy to bend down and pick my kids up in. Those are the things I look for,” explained. “Things that don't scratch me, don't scratch them. We've got a lot of work to do in a day of a life of a mom.”
