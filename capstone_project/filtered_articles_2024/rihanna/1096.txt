Jill Scott has been fighting for her life on social media after she praised Chris Brown, who has a long and storied history of violence against women.
Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday (April 21), the R&B songstress appeared to be overly obsequious when describing Brown, calling him “amazing” and praising everything from his looks to his dance moves.
“@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap… like THAT? Beyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional [fire emoji]. There’s nothing to debate,” she wrote in the first post.
When fans began pushing back — with one saying that she could “never forgive me who commit crimes against women and children. They can not be rehabilitated” — Scott doubled down.
“And I caution those who refuse to forgive because they will undoubtedly need forgiveness at some point in their lives,” she continued. “We’re all flawed and need help. Power to people who move past violence. The past is a terrible reminder AND the future is ours.”
Check out some of the posts, and replies, below.
Despite Jill Scott’s praise of Chris Brown, he has a history of violence against women, and continues to have legal issues stemming from violence to this day.
Back in 2009, he assaulted his then-girlfriend Rihanna, resulting in him pleading guilty to a felony charge and accepting a plea deal of community labor, five years’ probation and domestic violence counseling.

In the documentary Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life, Brown described each violent detail of how the incident unfolded.
“I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, like I punched her,” Brown said. “I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, ‘Fuck, why the hell did I hit her?’ From there, she just spit in my face … like spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more. It was a real on fight in the car.”
