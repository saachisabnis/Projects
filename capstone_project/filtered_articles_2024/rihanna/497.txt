Name: SAN SAN GEAR x PUMA Mostro
Colorways: Pink, Gray, Black
MSRP: TBC
Release Date: September 27
Where to Buy: SAN SAN GEAR
Update: It’s been over seven months since SAN SAN GEAR first teased its collaboration with PUMA on the Mostro silhouette. Now, it’s finally time for not only all three colorways of the duo’s first project together to drop, but a complementary apparel range too. Looking first at the kicks, all three looks sport the Mostro’s spiky outsole while hosting the SAN SAN GEAR logo at the tongue. The pink, gray and black pairs all feature gray detailing and the sneaker’s signature strap system. On top of this, SAN SAN GEAR has prepared its own in-line launch of apparel that is inspired by the collaboration, depicted in the Instagram gallery embedded below. Several racing-inspired pieces are joined by hooded long sleeves and a reversible zip-up hoodie. Release for both capsules is set to take place on September 27 via SAN SAN GEAR.

Original Story: It’s shaping up to be a big year for PUMA in the sneaker scene as it continues to iterate upon its staples while also embracing its partnerships. While key moments have included reconnecting with the likes of Rihanna and Hajime Sorayama, the German Sportswear brand has also looked to emerging labels to revitalize its offerings, with South Korea’s SAN SAN GEAR as the latest to join PUMA’s movement.

Connecting on the PUMA Mostro, the duo has prepared the recently-revived silhouette in three colorways that were unveiled at SAN SAN GEAR’s Paris showroom for Fall/Winter 2024. While the Mostro has been around for decades, its design remains as modern as ever. However, all three pairs from this collaboration favor a retro flair by offering all-suede uppers. SAN SAN GEAR branding appears at the shoe’s lateral, positioned next to the silhouette’s signature strap system. As for the color arrangements, all three utilize various grays at the Formstrip and spike-covered outsole while black, gray and pink uppers are featured across the shoes respectively.
At the time of writing, neither SAN SAN GEAR nor PUMA have shared any release details regarding their three colorways of the Mostro silhouette. Stay tuned for updates as, based on its inclusion in SAN SAN GEAR’s Fall/Winter 2024 showcase, it’s likely to arrive much later in the year, possibly as an exclusive regional release.
