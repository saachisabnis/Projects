In this new album, Jamie xx uses the staple sounds of house music with some R&B samples to create an irresistibly danceable set of songs. The use of horn also adds a lot of flare to the album on tracks like “Baddy On The Floor” and “Life”. “In Waves” also features many of the artist’s longtime collaborators like The Avalanches, and Romy who was also a member of The xx.

1)Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)
Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “Love Is Everywhere” has a chilled bass line and drawn out vocals. It is also used as a sample in Lil Yachty’s 2023 song “running out of time”.


    
This week we’re highlighting the track “Sleep Talk”, which has a relaxing vibe with drowned out vocals and melodic drumming.


6) Hippo Campus – “Flood” (2024)
Hailing from St. Paul, Minnesota, bedroom pop band Hippo Campus is back with the release of their 4th full-length album, “Flood”. On this album the band attempts to step away from any preconceived notions of how their music ‘should’ sound, instead deciding to start creating this album from a clean slate.
With themes of vulnerability across the record, the group aimed to capture a universal feeling that everyone can relate to. This new set of songs demonstrates what can be made when you have a tight-knit group that has been growing together both musically and personally, strengthening their bond with their art and their fans.
The highlighted track, “Slipping Away”, is sad in lyrics but has a beachy sound to balance out the song.
