Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were a must-see while celebrating the rapper’s birthday.
Rihanna, 36, turned up the heat with boyfriend Rocky while celebrating his 36th birthday on Thursday, October 3, in New York City. Rihannah, for her part, wowed in a bodycon black dress featuring a halter top, a plunging neckline and a flowy skirt. She made her look even more fabulous with a brown fur coat, sparkly sandals and layered gold and silver necklaces. She topped off her outfit with red tinted sunglasses and diamond stud earrings.
Rihanna’s makeup included bronzed and rosy cheeks and glossy lips. Her brunette hair was parted to the side and straightened with her curtain bangs covering one of her eyes.
While celebrating his birthday, Rocky wore a wool gingham coat from Bottega Veneta. The piece featured a gray body, classy lapels and black buttons. Underneath, he wore a silk striped button-up top and gray pants from the designer’s pre-spring 2025 collection. The rapper completed his ensemble with a yellow Bottega Veneta leather shopping bag featuring a white bunny, gold hoop earrings, Ray-Ban sunglasses and patent leather shoes.
This is hardly the first time Rihanna and Rocky, who share kids Riot, 15 months, and RZA, 2, have slayed while strutting through the streets.
