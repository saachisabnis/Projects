Rihanna has new music on the way but not in her usual format.
The 36-year-old mom of two is set to contribute original music to The Smurfs Movie, which Paramount Pictures and Paramount Animation will produce. Rihanna will also voice the iconic Smurfette in the forthcoming animated film.
The news comes one year after Rihanna appeared in Las Vegas to reveal that she’s voicing Smurfette in the new film slated for a Feb. 14, 2025 release.
Starring alongside Rihanna in Smurfs are Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation), Natasha Lyonne (Poker Face), JP Karliak (X-Men ’97), Daniel Levy (Schitt’s Creek), Amy Sedaris (BoJack Horseman), Nick Kroll (Big Mouth), James Corden (Peter Rabbit), Octavia Spencer (The Help), Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso), Sandra Oh (Grey’s Anatomy), Alex Winter (Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure), Billie Lourd (American Horror Story), and Xolo Maridueña (Blue Beetle), with Kurt Russell (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) and John Goodman (Monsters, Inc.).
Rihanna’s loyal fanbase, the Navy, has eagerly awaited a new album from the Grammy Award-winning singer since 2016’s Anti. Naturally, some of her devoted followers were disappointed upon learning about her decision to focus on original music for The Smurfs Movie.
“You’re telling me the only way I’m getting new Rihanna music is through Smurfs?, one user wrote.
