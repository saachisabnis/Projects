On the track, A$AP Rocky appears to fire some shots in Drizzy’s direction, rapping: “These n-ggas can’t stomach me, gotta go get a mandrake.”
A mandrake is the root of a plant, historically derived either from plants of the genus Mandragora found in the Mediterranean region, and is used to treat a variety of stomach issues.
Drake appeared to target A$AP Rocky and Rihanna — who he was previously romantically linked to — on his For All the Dogs album which dropped in October.
On the song “Fear of Heights,” he led fans to believe he was addressing RiRi by rapping: “Why they make it sound like I’m still hung up on you?/ That could never be/ Gyal can’t run me/ Better him than me/ Better it’s not me.”

Seemingly referencing her 2016 album, he added: “I’m anti, I’m anti/ Yeah, and the sex was average with you/ Yeah, I’m anti ’cause I had it with you/ Okay, I’m auntie like your daddy’s sister/ Auntie like a family picture/ And I had way badder bitches than you, TBH/ Yeah, that man, he still with you, he can’t leave you/ Y’all go on vacation, I bet it’s Antigua.”
Then, on “Another Late Night,” Drake mentioned Rocky by name, rapping: “I ain’t Pretty Flacko, bitch, this shit get really Rocky/ Damn, what? Dirty how I did him in the Wraith.”
