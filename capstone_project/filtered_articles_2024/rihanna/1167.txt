Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty is going to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, marking one of the brand’s most high-profile premium partnerships yet. Volunteers awarding medals to athletes will receive makeup kits so they can create a “designated look” using Fenty Beauty products, according to a press release.
Rihanna shared news of the linkup on the beauty brand’s Instagram this morning. 
Six hundred volunteers, ranging in ages from 18 to 21, will receive kits and tutorials on how to do their makeup for the global event. Fenty Beauty will also have its own makeup artists on-site in order to match volunteers to their foundation shade. 
Products in the makeup kit include the Eaze Drop’Lit All-Over Glow Enhancer, the Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint, Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer, and the Invisimatte Instant Setting and Blotting Powder.
The Paris Olympics begin on Friday, July 26, and run through August 11. The Paralympics will start on Wednesday, August 28 and run through Sunday, September 8.
Given the partnership, it wouldn’t be surprising if Rihanna herself made an appearance at the Games. She shared the collaboration news on her personal Instagram as well, writing, “tried to tell yall….we outside all 2024!!! PROUD to announce that @FentyBeauty is a premium partner of the Olympic AND Paralympic Games baby!!! #FentyxParis2024 💄🏆”
Rihanna spoke to ELLE in February 2023 about what she wants her beauty legacy to be—something to which Fenty Beauty’s Olympic partnership only adds. “My mantra has always been and always will be, ‘Beauty is there to have fun with. It should never feel like pressure or a uniform,’” she said. “I hope that carries on, because it’s an incredibly joyful and freeing way to live.”
