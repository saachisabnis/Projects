Whether it’s with her music, her fashion or her makeup, Rihanna has always been a trendsetter. Now, the “Don’t Stop The Music” artist is giving us a peek inside her #momlife – putting us on to an extravagant new snack and leaving us trying to find a way to get invited to her next play date.
If you’ve ever had small children in your house, you already know you need a constant supply of chicken nuggets in your kitchen to keep them happy. And while you may not have wanted to give the bite-sized breaded snacks that may or may not include actual chicken a try, the mom of sons RZA and Riot is here to let you know that it’s because you aren’t eating them right.
In a recent Instagram post, RiRi dropped a video of her and one of her mom friends sitting at a table full of snacks and having way too much fun.
“In the spirit of Christmas, this one is for all the “soccer moms,” she tagged the December 19 post, which has already received over 1.2 million likes.
The two can barely get through their laughs while trying to explain how they joined forces to turn chicken nuggets into a  delicacy. 
“You have your broke friend bring the nuggets,” Rihanna says, pointing to her partner holding up a plate. 
“And then you have your rich friend bring the caviar,” the friend says pointing back at Rihanna.
The two then spread the caviar on their nuggets, toast each other and take a bite – and the look on Rihanna’s face is priceless.
“I hate when I like my kids’ food, because I just be stealing their sh*t,” she said. 
Because there’s nothing better than the comment section of a Black person’s IG post, we went straight there to see what RiRi’s followers were saying.
Most of them were trying to figure out how they could get an invitation to hang out with the mompreneur. 
“Why do I wanna be Rihanna’s other broke friend so bad?” wrote someone in the comments.
Others couldn’t help but wonder if Rihanna and her friend had another snack they weren’t telling us about.
“When the eddie’s hit.. 😶‍🌫️🫡” wrote another commenter. 
If that’s what’s going down at all of Rihanna’s play dates, we  have a feeling there are plenty of moms willing to bring the nuggets!
