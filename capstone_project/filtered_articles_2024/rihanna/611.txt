‘The White Lotus’, ‘Wednesday’ and ‘Beef’ also scored multiple wins at the ceremony
The Last Of Us, The Bear, The White Lotus and more have nabbed multiple awards at the 2023 Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
The ceremony took place on Saturday (January 6) at the Peacock Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, and honoured artistic and technical achievements in American primetime television programming. The Last Of Us, which received the most nominations – 19 to be exact – also emerged as the biggest winner of the night, taking home eight awards.
Among these awards were wins for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, which were given to Storm Reid and Nick Offerman respectively. In addition, the series won several technical awards including Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup and Outstanding Visual Effects.
The Bear, The White Lotus and Wednesday followed The Last Of Us’ lead in multiple wins, earning four awards each. The Bear, which received seven nominations for its first season, won awards for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series, Outstanding Sound Editing and Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Outstanding Picture Editing for a Single-Camera Comedy Series.
Beef also received three awards, namely, Outstanding Casting for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, Outstanding Contemporary Costumes for a Limited of Anthology Series or Movie and Outstanding Picture Editing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.
The Last Of Us, Beef and The Bear were all named in NME’s top five TV shows of 2023, with The Bear’s second season emerging in the number one spot. In honour of its leading position, Paul Bradshaw highlighted the quieter side of the gritty, restaurant-situated comedy-drama.
“The genius of The Bear’s second season was found in the quieter moments,” he wrote. “No other series has since proved better at showing the shit endlessly hitting the fan, but it was the flashbacks, side-steps and breath-catching across these 10 perfect episodes that charred, sliced and tenderised harder than any of the kitchen chaos.”
Other winners at the 2023 Creative Arts Emmy Awards include Ted Lasso, with Sam Richardson winning Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Ed Sheeran, Foy Vance and Max Martin also won Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for their contribution to Ted Lasso’s soundtrack, ‘A Beautiful Game’. The Daniel Radcliffe-starring biopic Weird: The Al Yankovic Story also took home the award for Outstanding Television Movie.
The real-life “Weird Al” Yankovic was also present to accept the award, and offered a heartwarming speech about self-acceptance, stating: “Live the life you want to live. Be as weird as you want to be. Believe me, you will never find true happiness until you can truly accept who you are.”
