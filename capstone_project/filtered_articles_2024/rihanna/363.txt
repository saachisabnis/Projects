Rihanna celebrated the launch of Savage X Fenty Lavish Lace at Nordstrom Century City held on Oct. 10 in Los Angeles. 
The “Diamonds” songstress flattered her feet in a pair of glitzy Saint Laurent Liz satin crepe rhinestone mules. Retailing for $1,750, the designer pair featured almond-shaped toes, crisscrossing straps chocolate brown satin uppers and crystalized appliques that gave the shoe an undeniable shine. Geometric 4.3-inch heels rounded out the set, diversifying the silhouette. 
The sculptural heel has become an unofficial trademark for Saint Laurent, seen on many of their recent footwear creations. Rihanna’s footwear pick is nostalgic, harkening back to popular mule styles from the 2000s and early 90s.

Beyond the welcomed shine of the crystalized detailing, the chocolate brown uppers acted to ground the silhouette, giving it a wearable feel. Not to mention the satin sheen mirrored the applique’s shimmer. Similar mules to the performer’s own can be found via top brands like Prada, Zara, Saint Laurent and Gainvito Rossi, among others.

All cozied up, the “Umbrella” singer layered on a brown and red Fendi curly lamb shaggy coat paired with a matching brown lace corset slip hailing from her very own Savage x Fenty. Worn beneath her dress, Rihanna sported lace camo tights, also from Savage x Fenty. 
The neutral tones found throughout her look complimented her footwear choice. Rihanna’s ensemble was quintessential fall, marrying comfort and style perfectly. 
For Rihanna, no shoe is too bold — or heel too high. The “Rated R” musician has worn many shoes over the years, including sky-high heels and chunky sneakers. Rihanna’s red carpet styles often include strappy sandals, platforms and pointed-toe pumps by Amina Muaddi, Prada and Tom Ford that coordinate with her outfits. Her off-duty styles also include similarly daring sandals and boots by Celine, Givenchy and Saint Laurent.
