GloRilla has stated many times in the past that she is “twins” with Rihanna, and now fans are starting to see the resemblance with the release of Glo’s debut album cover.
On Thursday (September 19), the Memphis native unveiled the LP’s cover in an Instagram post, confirming that GLORIOUS will arrive on October 11.

Moments later, a Rihanna fan shared a side-by-side of GLORIOUS and Rih’s debut Music Of The Sun, noting the similarities.
“I really see the vision wait…” the fan wrote. In the replies, another fan made a play on Glo’s accent and said, “her Murrrsic of the Sun wait—”

Another fan did a side by side of a photo of Glo that looks similar to the cover of Rih’s 2010 album LOUD, adding, “I ain’t never seen Rihanna and Glo in the same room. Just sayin.”

Last year, GloRilla shared an audio clip on X of a voicemail left by her grandmother (presumably to her mother), where she asserted that Glo and Rihanna share a striking resemblance.
How come you didn’t tell me Rihanna and Gloria look so much alike?” her grandmother began.

She continued: “I can’t tell them girls apart on TV. That girl look just like your daughter.”
And the album news will be music to Rih’s ears, as she previously inquired about its arrival when she fell in love with Glo’s most recent single, “TGIF.”

In July, Rih privately messaged GloRilla saying: “You got all summer sis! I know dis wild hypocritical but when the album drop?”
The Memphis native shared the message in a recap of her visit to the 2024 BET Awards but did show her response to the “Umbrella” singer.

Rihanna’s question had many fans in stitches, with one joking: “Ri asking for an album is diabolical asf.”
Another said: “Rihanna play to much! Tell her to jump on the album!!!”

As for what fans can expect on the LP, GloRilla gave fans a first taste of what to expect earlier this week, previewing a new track on Instagram Live that borrows from a Southern Rap classic.
In one clip, reposted by The Shade Room, Big Glo can be seen rapping along to a snippet of a new song, which borrows both its cadence and beat from “Wipe Me Down,” the 2017 hit by Foxx-a-million, Boosie Badazz, Webbie.

The LP follows the Memphis native’s mixtape Ehhthang Ehhthang, which dropped in April. The 12-track project features appearances from Moneybagg Yo, Megan Thee Stallion, Kevo Money, Real Boston Richey and Finesse2Tymes.
