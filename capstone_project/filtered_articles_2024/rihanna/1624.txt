 Almost five months after finalizing her divorce from Benjamin Millepied, Natalie Portman is publicly speaking about the split for the first time. On Monday's episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the May December actress opened up about splitting up with her ex-husband of 11 years—and credited an unlikely star with helping her get her groove back after a tough year.

 Portman shared the way Rihanna boosted her confidence at Paris Fashion Week in January amid her divorce. Portman–who, at the time, had been separated from Millepied for a few months, per People– ran into Rihanna outside of the Dior Haute Couture show. The fangirling was mutual, with the “Umbrella” star calling Portman "one of the hottest bitches in Hollywood” while the Oscar-award winning actress reciprocated, “I love you, and I listen to your music all the time.”

 The compliment clearly stuck with Portman, who told Fallon, "I think every woman going through a divorce should get to have Rihanna say to her that she's a bad bitch."

 The host gave her a round of applause before showing the clip of them meeting. Watching the moment, Portman continued, "It was exactly what I needed.” 

 "That's a big deal," Fallon agreed. The Black Swan star went one step further, revealing, "It was a formative moment in my life."

 In the viral video, Portman can also be heard freaking out after receiving RiRi's compliment. “I love you,” she told Rihanna, who replied, “I am a fucking fan.” Overwhelmed, Portman told her, "I’m gonna faint. I’m gonna black out. You’re just such a queen. Thank you.”

 She later shared a photo of the pair hugging on her Instagram, writing, "Still not over this… 🥹 @badgalriri."
