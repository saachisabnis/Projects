Rihanna and A$AP Rocky just brought their mutual love of lip balm to a small screen near you.
The beauty mogul, 36, and rapper, 35, just released a nearly two-minute short film, Born to Steal: Yours, Mine, Ours on YouTube to support their first beauty collaboration, Fenty Skin Lux Balm, which launched in January.
Rihanna doesn’t speak in the black-and-white, old Hollywood-inspired spot, where “lips speak louder than words,” according to the clip’s description.
It opens with Rihanna giving one of her iconic stares to the camera while a narrator begins, “She was a classy dame, but she had odd ways of showing her affection.”
The narrator goes on to tell the story of a woman (Rihanna) who steals the heart — and stuff — of her lover (A$AP Rocky).
“The more savage of the species, the females are known to hoard from the unsuspecting male,” the narrator continues as the Diamonds singer is seen lifting one of his blazers from the closet.
Later, in bed, Rihanna applies the balm to Rocky’s lips. Her fragrance makes a cameo on her nightstand as well.
The video dropped following hours of anticipation.
On Feb. 27, Rihanna’s Instagram handles for Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin resurfaced a clip of Rihanna telling Complex that “anything me or Rocky collaborate on is gonna be fire,” with a caption that read: “@badgalriri x @asaprocky 🤍 2.28.24 📺”
Later that day, Rihanna posted a teaser of the clip on her Instagram feed, which drew a black heart reaction from Rocky.

Rihanna and A$SP Rocky’s lip balm came out in January.
“Introducing new Lux Balm, Fenty Skin 4her, 4him, 4all,” he said in a press release for the collaboration, while Rihanna shared, “We created the baddest lip balm out there! [This] is the ultimate effortless lip savior – it glides on like butter and delivers instant hydration. My lips are looking and feeling better than ever, and the packaging is so sleek it fits in any purse or pocket.”
Rocky originally teased the collaboration when he released song “RIOT (Rowdy Pipe’n)” months earlier. “Flossy, glossy / Nah b---- this ain’t lip gloss / Lux Balm up in my palm / New collab with my baby mom.”
