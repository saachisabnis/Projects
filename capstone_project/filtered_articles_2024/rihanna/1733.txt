Rihanna is a style icon. Full stop.
But as such, the Savage x Fenty founder, who won the CFDA Fashion Awards' Fashion Icon Award in 2014, occasionally gets compared to fictionalized characters when she wears out-of-this-world looks.
Her latest fashion statement, a furry Christian Lacroix coat and matching hat she wore to the 2024 Fashion Awards presented by Pandora, had fans swearing she was channeling beloved muppet Cookie Monster.
The "Woo" singer, 36, attended the event to support 36-year-old partner A$AP Rocky, who was honored with the Cultural Innovator Award. Under her asymmetrical coat, her ensemble seemed to feature a black bustier and a lace skirt.
She added more splashes of black with sheer tights, and opera gloves. Naturally, she shined bright in diamonds, from her multiple necklaces to her shoes.

The Fenty Beauty founder rocked a glossy, ombré lip and styled her hair in a half-up 'do. The face-framing pieces that were left out had a soft curl.
The blue-on-blue look had some spectators comparing her to a number of fictional creations.
One wrote, "Nothing like a James P. Sullivan fur coat & hat," in reference to the lovable Monsters Inc. character, while another questioned, "Is Rihanna being attacked by the cookie monster?"

This is not the first time fans felt one of Rihanna's looks vibed muppet.
When she appeared on stage at the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Awards to perform "Bitch Better Have My Money" in a furry money-green Versace coat accessorized with matching boots, sunglasses, and a massive "Versace" choker, the ensemble was compared to Sesame Street's Oscar the Grouch.

Other furry coats she's worn, such as a read heart-shaped topper and a purple floor-length design, at one time were likened to Looney Tunes monster Gossamer and Grimace, McDonald's enormous taste bud.
