Rihanna is coming into the holidays red-hot.
The superstar, 36, took to Instagram Tuesday to show off her seasonally appropriate red lipstick look: a lip liner ($20 $15) and liquid lipstick ($29 $17.40) from her own Fenty Beauty brand, both in the blue-red shade The MVP.
Along with her cherry-colored lip, Riri wore a risqué Savage X Fenty dress ($90) with a second-skin fit and  sheer fishnet insets that framed her curves.
The mom of two finished things off with some truly jaw-dropping jewelry, wearing two enormous diamond rings that took up more than half of her fingers.
She also layered a few onyx and diamond bracelets and pulled her hair into a festive updo that showed off her sparkling stud earrings.
While plenty of fans complimented her lipstick, others took notice of the eye-popping baubles. “Not those rings costing more than my apartment,” one person commented.
Stylist Matthew Mazur wrote, “let’s discuss the rings,” to which someone asked, “THE boulder?” and another said, “that’s my whole college tuition right there lmaooooooo.”
And singer-songwriter Ayra Starr dubbed Rihanna a “yummy mummy.”
Naturally, many fans begged the singer to return to music in the comments — but in a recent interview, the Bad Gal may have squashed hope for a ninth studio album.
Speaking at a Fenty Beauty event in Barbados earlier this month, she said, “Music was the thing that got the attention, but God had other plans for me.”
She continued, “I was able to create in ways that were very sincere and genuine, organic, and authentic to the things that I love. So, it doesn’t even feel like a job.”
Rihanna shares two sons, RZA, 2, and Riot, 1, with boyfriend A$AP Rocky.
