Rihanna has turned more than a few heads by stepping out in a sexy and stunning carnival costume while partying in her homeland of Barbados.
RiRi appeared at Crop Over Festival on Monday (August 5) wearing a flamboyant and revealing outfit designed by Gianvito Rossi that was adorned with gold and bronze jewels, along with a regal headpiece and feathered wings.

This is the first time the Barbadian beauty has attended the historic festival since 2019, during which time she’s given birth to two children with boyfriend A$AP Rocky.
Fans have been seeing quite a lot of Rihanna of late, with the singer also flashing her underwear in a recent Instagram video.
In the short clip, the “Diamonds” hitmaker was seen prancing around a city sidewalk in a mini skirt and blouse before pulling up the skirt to show off her black panties.
She captioned the clip: “Since I clearly wont be achieving my six pack til next summer, I switched my summer goal to matching my shoes to my panties!”

“[Y]ou know how much switching my hair up matters to me. I’ve had almost every texture, color, length, from weaves to braids to natural — so I am launching a flexible line of products for not only every hair want, but every single product is designed to strengthen and repair all types of hair, which is what we truly need! It’s time to play and get stronger by the style.”
The Fenty Hair collection currently features nine different products that cater for a wide range of hair styles, similar to the inclusive approach to her underwear and beauty lines.
