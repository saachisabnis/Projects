Rihanna has kicked off her new collection of Savage X Fenty Valentine’s Day lingerie with a “Savage Confessions” campaign.

	This time around, Rih has introduced the “See Thru U” and “Ruffle Luv” women’s line — and for men, the “Luv Language” capsule including satin boxers, sleepwear and more.

	To further promote the collection, the mama-of-two sat down to answer some of the most burning, steamy, intimate questions as she wears the “See Thru U” unlined Balconette bra, high-waist bikini panty, garter belt, and monogram micro-fishnet stockings in Millennial Pink. 

	“Who wrote these questions?” she starts in the video as the entire room bursts in laughter. 

	










	In another Instagram clip, the “Lift Me Up” singer is asked the question: “What is your love language?” to which she responds, “quality time.”

	“It’s a luxury around these parts,” she added. “I’m busy … baby daddy’s busy. Anytime someone could carve out a little bit of time for me, I feel really special.” Hilariously, a voice in the background blurts out, “Bi**h, that’s why you’ve been keeping us held hostage?” as Rihanna replies, “Que?”
