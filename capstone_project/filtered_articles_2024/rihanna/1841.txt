WE DO NOT DESERVE HER. 
Because she's nothing if not relatable, Rihanna stepped out for a Target run in New York City on Sunday—apparently to pick up some items for New Year's Eve. But while some of us (me) show up to the supermarket in straight-up pyjamas accessorised with nothing but pimple patches and my Clubcard, Rihanna rolled up in a statement-making furry hat paired with an oversized Tupac shirt and jeans + a leather jacket and matching bag. The rest of us could... simply never.
FYI Rihanna is about to launch the  Cherry Dub Pore Purify’r gel cleanser (on January 2), and spoke to InStyle about the product. Honestly, it sounds amazing and I can't wait to add it to my basket.
“I’m obsessed with my pores; ask anyone!” she said. “If your pores are tight, you’ll get a smooth canvas for makeup; if you’re going makeup-free, you’ll look fresh and photo-ready.”
 The wash uses Barbados cherries, Niacinamide and Aloe, and Rihanna says “It just makes the whole skin-care experience super sensorial—you get this juicy red color and uplifting tropical scent. It smells like home to me! It’s fun to look at and smells amazing, which I think is the key for consistency in skin care. You gotta love the whole experience to be able to do it all the time and get those results.”
