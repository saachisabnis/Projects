For once, there are no football games or sold-out stadium shows to attend, so Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are enjoying some well-deserved downtime together, according to reports. With the occasional Oscars after-party thrown in, naturally.
According to an anonymous source speaking to Us Weekly, Swift and Kelce are currently in the “nesting” phase of their relationship (cue the baby speculation). “They're focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,” the insider said. “They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed.”
While the couple are (allegedly) currently cohabiting at Swift's house in LA rather than her usual home base of New York City, they took a break from their Netflix-and-chill schedule to attend several Oscars parties, including the one hosted by Madonna, which had a strict no-cameras policy. Per Page Six, Kelce was also spotted at Jay-Z and Beyoncé's “Gold Party” in an Instagram snap with the Oscar-winning American Fiction screenwriter Cord Jefferson and podcaster Tommy Alter. His girlfriend, for whatever reason, was not pictured with him, however.

That said, I'm going to go ahead and guess that Taylor Swift was there, even if we don't have the pics to prove it. As Us Weekly's source noted, “They don’t want to spend too much time apart.”
