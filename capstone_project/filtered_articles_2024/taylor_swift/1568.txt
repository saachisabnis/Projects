LISA BOOTHE (FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR): I find Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce insufferable, from the beer chugging thing from Taylor Swift — cool, everyone can do it, it's not that hard, Taylor, we've all done it, from chugging a beer — to Travis Kelce knocking his coach over with his chest in his violent bit of rage. Taylor, you should break up with him, he's got issues. I find the two of them insufferable. I wish they weren't a part of the whole thing and then I could have enjoyed the Super Bowl more.
...
HARRIS FAULKNER (CO-HOST): But you're right, I'm not going to argue with you, when she was chugging beer, and you've got kids in the room and she's slamming it down, I did question, you know, what do we really know about this 34-year-old woman, and does she realize how young her audience is? Or does it not matter?
BOOTHE: It's like, “OK, you're so cool, Taylor.”
