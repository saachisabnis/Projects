This is not the first time that a fake Swift song has made its rounds on the internet. In October of last year, a fake breakup song emerged.
"You stole my heart, you intercepted it / Now youâ€™re gone, have to accept it / Did I meet your mom too soon? / Or did I do what I always do? / Yeah, we made it to the 50, and then you kissed me / We made it to the 40, a new love story," Swift's AI song lyrics said.
Swift and Kelce have been together since the summer of last year, and Swift recently cheered Kelce on when the Kansas City Chiefs won the 2024 Super Bowl against the San Fransisco 49ers.
