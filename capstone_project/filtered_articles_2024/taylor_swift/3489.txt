Taylor Swift is counting down the days until the release of her new album.

	On Saturday (April 6), the 34-year-old pop superstar used her lucky number to remind Swifties that there are only 13 days left until the arrival of her highly anticipated album, The Tortured Poets Department.

	The “Cruel Summer” singer took to her Instagram Story to share a clip of a typewriter writing the words, “13 days until THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,” alongside a pre-order link to the album.
