Swifties...are you ready for it? 
Taylor Swift's upcoming album The Tortured Poets Department is slated to drop this week and fans around the globe have already begun searching for clues (in true Swift/Swiftie fashion) amid the highly-anticipated release. After all, it wouldn't be a Taylor Swift album release if Easter eggs weren't involved. 
Chicago Swifties gathered at the site of a mysterious mural on Monday (April 15) in the River North neighborhood as artists crafted a "secret message" QR code that is definitely album coded. The QR code in question is surrounded by typewriter-style letters that read "TTPD" (A.K.A. The Tortured Poets Department). Windy City fans encompassed the mural in both awe of its design and suspicion of its message. 
What does it all mean? Are the artists Taylor's personal messengers hired to spread new album details, or was it just for fun? Hopefully the answers to these questions will be revealed along with the album's release later this week. 
The Tortured Poets Department stands out as Swift's 11th studio album, and one she's been teasing since 2023. As if a brand new album wasn't already thrilling enough, the record-breaking GRAMMY Award winner gifted fans a TTPD bonus track back in February titled, "The Bolter," and shared the record's track list featuring a few collabs! 
Swiftes can look forward to the release of The Tortured Poets Department in its entirety on Friday, April 19th!
