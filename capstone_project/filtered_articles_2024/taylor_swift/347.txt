Love her or hate her. Taylor Swift has created an empire and influenced way more than just her millions of fans.
Swift is so polarizing, that colleges and universities around the country have started offering courses on her, including one in New York State.
St. Bonaventure University will explore pop culture’s role in the media landscape and its impact on public policy in a new special course during the spring semester.
“From the protest music of the 1960s to the phenomena of Taylor Swift, pop culture has been a part of daily life in America,” said Dr. Richard Lee, a professor in the university’s Jandoli School of Communication.
Several topics will be covered in the course, all designed by Professor Lee who integrated elements from his career in journalism, government, and academia.
St. Bonaventure University was founded in 1858 thanks in part to Nicholas Devereux, a large landholder and financier from Utica, New York. He and John Timon, Bishop of Buffalo, persuaded a group of friars to venture from Italy to America and establish a Catholic college and seminary in Western New York.
