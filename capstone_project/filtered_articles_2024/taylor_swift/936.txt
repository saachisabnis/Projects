As their relationship continues to evolve, it’s not out of the question that these two could be headed toward the altar in the future—and with this comes some pretty major decisions. Namely, would Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce sign a prenup? While only time will tell if this duo decides to take that next big step toward marriage, we might have gotten a pretty good hint about their financial plans as a couple from a surprising source: Kelce’s dad, Ed.
Swift and Kelce were linked publicly for the first time in September 2023, when the Midnights singer attended her first Chiefs game in support of her NFL beau, who plays as a tight-end for the Kansas City team. Their romance started sometime earlier that summer, after Kelce revealed on an episode of his “New Heights” podcast, which he hosts with his older brother Jason Kelce, just how much he wanted to meet Swift and exchange numbers with her after attending her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. During an interview with the Wall Street Journal in November 2023, Kelce went to reveal that Swift reached out to him after listening to the episode—and the rest, as they say, is history.

The couple—who have continued to make appearances together during the NFL’s regular season and postseason—have already started sparking rumors of a future engagement. In December 2023, a source told Page Six that the tight end had asked the singer’s father, Scott Swift, for permission for her hand in marriage. “Scott has been asked for his blessing and has wholeheartedly given it, and Travis has been talking to friends about a ring,” the insider said at the time, speculating that the engagement could happen as soon as the summer of 2024. Though, a source later told The Messenger that an engagement wouldn’t be happening “anytime soon,” noting, “There is no engagement at this time.” 
Of course, that doesn’t mean that an engagement isn’t in the cards later down the line. But there’s one big question that remains to be answered: would Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce sign a prenup? Kelce’s dad, Ed, was asked the same question during a recent interview—and his answer was pretty revealing. Keep on reading ahead for what he said about the potential for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s prenup plans.

 









During an episode of Audacy’s 92.3 The Fan radio show, Ed was questioned about his son’s financial plans in the event that he decides to get married to Taylor Swift one day. The father of two had a graceful answer for the somewhat awkward question, explaining his thoughts about Swift and Kelce’s future. 
“I don’t know that Taylor is out there trying to make money, trying to build this huge empire,” Ed said. “I think she’s out there following her passion, doing what she knows and what she enjoys. People are just throwing money at her, you know what I mean.”
While this neither confirms nor denies Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s prenup plans, it does seem to echo what we all know: as two successful people in their own right, Swift and Kelce don’t need to worry about needing each other’s money. Only time will tell where this takes them!
