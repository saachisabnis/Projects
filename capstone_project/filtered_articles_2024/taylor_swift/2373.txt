How interesting that Taylor Swift's latest album is called The Tortured Poets Department. You'll see what I mean in a second.
When you think of her creativity, writing, and powerful influence as a living icon, it's not a surprise that one of her relatives is already in the history books for the same things.
To Massachusetts and then Connecticut we go, where Taylor's lineage traces her to a literary icon, according to the CT Insider website.
The two famous writers in this family tree are Taylor, with her incredible songs she personally pens, and Emily Dickinson, one of the most important figures in poetry and the literary world.
You may recall that according to Rolling Stone, Taylor referenced Emily when she was accepting the Songwriter-Artist of the Decade at the Nashville Songwriters Association International in 2022.
If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre.
We've all heard of the genealogy company Ancestry.com, and maybe you've even used it to research your family tree. Well, according to CT Insider, the company itself combed through historical records and found that Taylor and the 19th-century poet born and raised in the Amherst area of Massachusetts are distant cousins. They're sixth cousins, to be exact.
Swift and Dickinson both descend from a 17th-century English immigrant (Swift’s 9th great-grandfather and Dickinson’s 6th great-grandfather who was an early settler of Windsor, Connecticut). Taylor Swift’s ancestors remained in Connecticut for six generations until her part of the family eventually settled in northwestern Pennsylvania, where they married into the Swift family line.
I'm sure Taylor will visit the Emily Dickinson Museum one day, even if it's privately.
