A notorious Philadelphia jeweler has reportedly made an offer to pro footballer Travis Kelce to help him propose to girlfriend Taylor Swift.
Swiftce's Getting Hot and Heavy
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance began innocently over a friendship bracelet the Chiefs tight end gifted the singer during her The Eras Tour stop in Kansas City in the summer of 2023.

By the time the NFL season began in September, the two seemed serious enough that Swift began showing up at Arrowhead Stadium on a regular basis to watch Travis play football. He, in turn, would follow her to South America for her tour stops there.
When Will He Put a Ring on it?

That's what EVERYONE is waiting for, including Steven Singer in Philadelphia. Yes, the 'I Hate Steven Singer' guy. The jeweler, located on Walnut St., is reportedly so enthralled with Traylor that he's offered up a $1 million dollar diamond engagement ring in hopes of encouraging Kelce to propose to Swift.
Singer has reportedly said, “I would be honored to help design a truly extraordinary ring exclusively for them,” according to The Independent. The jewelry also remarked that his own daughter is an 'avid' Swiftie.
An Offer Kelce Can't Refuse?

He can and probably will say, 'Thanks, but no thanks.'
Travis Kelce has won two Super Bowls. Not to mention, in 2020, Travis Kelce signed a 4-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs worth $57.2 million.
As for Taylor Swift? Well, she's reached a billionaire status, thanks in large part to The Eras Tour.

Travis is probably going to spend more than a $1M on a Swift-worthy engagement ring, but you can't blame Steven Singer for trying.
