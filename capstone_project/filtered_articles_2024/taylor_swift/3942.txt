Turns out Taylor's most intense relationship is with 🇬🇧.
Taylor Swift has made several references to London over the years, and The Tortured Poets Department is no exception thanks to a lil' song casually titled "So Long London." And her focus on the city makes sense! London has been a huge part of Taylor's life; She's lived in England, has had several serious relationships based in the city, and even recorded music there.
Considering Tay's Tortured Poets promotion already has several 🇬🇧-themed Easter eggs (um, hi to the QR code referencing Matty Healy's alias), we're here with the Taylor + London relationship timeline you didn't know you needed. 
Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.
Alexa, play “...Ready for It?”
Correction: screaming!
Taylor starts dating the original London Boy™ Harry Styles, and they actually spend quite a lot of time together in England! Like, here they are chilling in Cheshire:
Taylor drops Red, and let's just say the song "Come Back...Be Here" has some telling London refs....
"I guess you're in London todayAnd I don't wanna need you this wayCome back, be hereCome back, be here"
and...
"But you're in London, and I break down'Cause it's not fair that you're not around"
Taylor Swift writes 1989 and has this to say about "Clean:"
Taylor and another ~London Boy~ Matty Healy are spotted at a party in the U.K. and a quick round of dating rumors begins:
Taylor starts dating Tom Hiddleston, man who is from—you guessed it—London. She loves herself a British accent! Though FWIW, the vast majority of Taylor and Tom's short relationship takes place stateside (specifically in Rhode Island) vs. in Tom's homeland.  
The Sun reports that Taylor was staying in North London (in disguise) and that she and Joe Alwyn are dating. Note: Taylor and Tom Hiddleston broke up in September of 2016, and she seemingly moved to London soon after. 
Taylor actually spoke about this phase of her life with TIME Magazine during her Person of the Year interview, saying (re: Kim Kardashian infamous leaking her call with Kanye West), “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”
Anyway, back to The Sun! The outlet spoke to an insider in May 2017 who says "She's been walking around with Joe in London using disguises, like scarves and hats, to keep her identity under wraps. Nobody has a clue they've been walking past a music superstar - not even her new neighbors." 
Taylor starts working on Lover and records both "London Boy" and "Daylight" at Metropolis Studios in London.
The closest Tay and Joe come to going Instagram official is when she drops this pic from the BAFTAs in London, where she and Joe celebrated his film The Favourite. 
A source tells E! News that Taylor is "back and forth between Nashville and England spending time with her family and with Joe's family. They take walks in the neighborhood and go on hikes to get fresh air." 
Tay wins a BRIT Award and mentions Joe explicitly in her speech.
Taylor starts dating Matty Healy shortly after her breakup with fellow Brit Joe Alwyn. They don't spend time (that we know of) in London during their brief 'ship, but the vibes are...certainly messy:
