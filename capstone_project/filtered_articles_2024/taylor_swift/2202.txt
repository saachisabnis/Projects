For some Swifties flying to Singapore for Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour shows this weekend, the concert experience is starting before they even touch down.
Philippine Airlines has been giving custom friendship bracelets to fans en route to Singapore National Stadium, where Swift will soon set up shop for six shows starting Saturday (March 2). The company shared a photo of strings of beads reading “1989,” “Lover,” “Fly Pal” and more on Instagram, as well as videos on its Story of flight attendants passing them out from a box to fliers.

“Look what you made us do! #flyPAL 03.01.2024 ✈️💫,” the airline captioned one of its posts.
The accessories have been a staple of the “Anti-Hero” singer’s Eras Tour since the very beginning, with fans trading them at shows in honor of the “You’re on Your Own, Kid” lyric “Make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.” Even A-list concertgoers such as Halsey, Mariska Hargitay, Simu Liu, Brie Larson, Sarah Paulson, Lupita Nyong’o and more have participated in the trend.
And at Swift’s Feb. 23 show in Sydney, Australia, Travis Kelce got in on the fun. Photos from the night show him enjoying his superstar girlfriend’s performance with both of his wrists stacked with various friendship bracelets from fans, some of whom he gifted guitar picks.
The bracelets also happen to be a key part of the 14-time Grammy winner and Kelce’s love story. Before they started dating last summer, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end revealed on his New Heights podcast that he’d tried unsuccessfully to give Swift a beaded band with his phone number on it at her performance at Arrowhead Stadium — and the rest was history.
The “Karma” musician will be in Singapore through March 9, as will opener Sabrina Carpenter. After that, the Eras Tour will take a two-month pause — during which Swift will release her new album The Tortured Poets Department April 19 — before resuming in May with a stint in France.
