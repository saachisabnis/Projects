The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Channel
They were an unlikely pair at an unlikely event. Taylor Swift hung out with Real Housewives of New Jersey's Teresa Giudice at Coachella.
Ug, Taylor...why do you make me come for you during an album release week? Lol.
JK, lol, for all I know, Taylor spends her time on the road binge-watching episodes of Bravo's Real Housewives. If Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence can count herself as one of the most devoted fans of The Kardashians, TSwizz could surely find entertainment with the Housewives, no?
Coachella, one of the most high-profile musical festivals of every year, happened in Indio, California over the weekend.
It was there that Taylor Swift and boyfriend Travis Kelce took in the performances and caught up with Ice Spice, Jack Antonoff, Sabrina Carpenter, and, of all celebs, Teresa Giudice.
The reality television star, one of New Jersey's most notorious, managed to get Taylor to pose for a photo, snapped by Giudice's hubby 'Louie' Ruelas, according to People.com.

Giudice went 'Coachella Barbie' for the festival with bright pink cowboy hat, while Taylor was dressed in jean shorts, baseball cap, and a black leather jacket.
Hmm, wonder what they talked about?

One thing's for sure, though, Teresa looks, um, different.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be catty. I'm prob just jelly, lol.
Coachella marked the return of No Doubt. It was the first time in almost eight years the band had performed together.
