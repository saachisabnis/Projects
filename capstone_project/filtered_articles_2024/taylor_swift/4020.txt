The video appears to tell the tale of star-crossed lovers set in a dystopian romance.
It was during the Grammys in February that the Anti-Hero singer, who has been touring the world this year, said that her 11th studio album would drop on April 19.
The record, which includes a collaboration with Florence And The Machine, achieved more than 300 million streams in a single day after its release, according to music streaming platform Spotify.
Hours after dropping the 16-song edition of her album the US pop superstar announced an expanded version with an extra 15 songs, titled The Anthology.

The Bad Blood singer, who is known for taking inspiration from past relationships for her music, has placed So Long, London at number five in the album‚Äôs tracklist ‚Äì the slot reserved for the most meaningful song on each of Swift‚Äôs records.
The song is thought to offer new insight into her split from The Favourite actor Joe Alwyn after six years together.
Before the album‚Äôs release, fans had speculated whether the album title was a reference to Alwyn.
In December 2022, Alwyn and Normal People star Paul Mescal said they had a WhatsApp group chat with Fleabag actor Andrew Scott called The Tortured Man Club.
Fans have also speculated that a number of her tracks refer to her blossoming romance with NFL star Travis Kelce.
In addition to his collaboration with Swift, Malone recently featured on Beyonce‚Äôs highly anticipated Act II: Cowboy Carter on the track Levii‚Äôs Jeans.
