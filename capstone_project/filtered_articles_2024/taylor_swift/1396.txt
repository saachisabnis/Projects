The limited-edition Echo Falls Summer Berries bottles feature four American Football buzzwords: Tight end, Kickoff, Blitz and Touchdown.
Once again, Swift is expected to make the big game, taking the 11-hour flight from Japan post-concert to watch Travis perform.
Travis previously applauded his popstar girlfriend for being 'all in' on supporting the Kansas City Chiefs ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl.
Having attended 12 games so far this season, Taylor's undeniable support did not go unnoticed as Travis gushed over her loyalty.
The tight went on SiriusXM NFL Radio on Monday and praised Swift's dedication to the team.
'She's all in man, she's all in,' Travis said. 'She's part of Chiefs Kingdom 100 per cent.'
Travis also talked about how he has been handling the magnitude of their relationship.
'You asked me how it is and to be honest, I'm learning throughout this all, you know?' Kelce said. 'I'm just kind of on the plane ride just cruising and trying to figure this thing out on the run, man.'
The loved-up couple made their relationship public in September with the singer's first appearance at a Chiefs game.
Taylor is expected to attend her 13th game in the Super Bowl despite having a concert in Tokyo the day prior as part of her world tour.
She appears to be taking her busy schedule in her stride in late months as she has also released five albums in five years and has rerecorded many of her past records.
