Twitter/X users are facing issues searching Swift’s name on the site.
Earlier this week, several graphic A.I. images of Swift circulated on the social media site.
Things got so bad that the White House released a statement on the situation.
“We are alarmed by the reports of the…circulation of images that you just laid out – of false images to be more exact, and it is alarming,” said White House press secretator Karine Jean-Pierre.
“While social media companies make their own independent decisions about content management, we believe they have an important role to play in enforcing their own rules to prevent the spread of misinformation, and non-consensual, intimate imagery of real people,”
On Saturday afternoon, several Twitter/X users noticed they couldn’t search for “Taylor Swift” on the platform.
