So, if it happened in those cities, could psychedelic mushrooms come to Idaho, become legal, and then become available to the general public (over 18, or 21, depending on whatever rules/laws come with it)?

What do you think? Could 'shrooms ever get legalized in Idaho, and if so, do you think it's a good idea? Let's connect and get your two cents. Always curious to get your point of view.
