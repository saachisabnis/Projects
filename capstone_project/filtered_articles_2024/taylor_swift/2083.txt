It seems like everyone is in Australia right now — Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Pink. But some people who maybe shouldn’t be down under? Kourtney Kardashian’s school-aged children! The Lemme founder shared a bunch of beautiful new pictures from Australia, where she currently is to support husband Travis Barker and his Blink-182 tour, and it sparked a bunch of backlash from people for a pretty valid reason: why are Kourt’s kids out of school?
The Kardashians star is mom to Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, with ex Scott Disick, and baby Rocky, 3 months, with Barker. She took at least the younger three with her to Australia, which she shared in a recap photo dump on Instagram.

“Thank you @airbnb for such a beautiful home to create memories that I will always remember and cherish,” she wrote. “Mornings making banana pancakes and nights playing uno forever and ever!!”
The pictures included one shot of Kardashian walking along a pier holding Barker’s hand in one hand and Reign’s hand in the other, a picture of Reign and Penelope walking down a huge set of steps toward the ocean, and a picture of Penelope smiling in the mirror as Kardashian takes a selfie. (And a bunch of photos of their luxe AirBnB too, obviously.)
But people were worried about the kids being out of school this long. “Were the kids out of school this whole time?” one person asked.
“Don’t your kids go to school?” someone else wondered.
Others defended her. “Who gives a sh*t these memories, family time last forever probably learnt more than in school. History, culture, music, geography, 👏” one person wrote.
Still, we wondered too. I got a phone call from the principal after taking my kindergartener out of school a couple days before Thanksgiving break for a family vacation, so I can only imagine what weeks away in the middle of February would be like.
We do know a little about their schooling situation, thanks to Kardashian’s sister Kim Kardashian. “I love my morning routine. It’s like madhouse chaos, it’s amazing. I do carpool every single day that’s my thing. All my sisters do, so we see each other at school,” the mom of four said in a 2022 episode of Live With Kelly and Ryan. “There’s like seven cousins all together. So there’s three in one class, one in another, two in another, two in another — did I count right? Something like that,” she added with a laugh.
So there you go — Penelope and Reign’s cousins are probably collecting their homework for them while they are hanging out halfway across the world!
