BALTIMORE (WBFF) â€” Still stung by the Baltimore Ravens loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game on Sunday, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott apparently changed his view of the big event in Las Vegas two weeks from now.
The Chiefs defeated the Baltimore Ravens, 17-10, at M&T Bank Stadium to win the AFC Conference Championship. They will play the winner of the NFC Title Game, the San Francisco 49ers.
"I know we're all still in disbelief. This is 'Blue Monday,' Mr. Governor," said Scott. "We no longer call it the Super Bowl. It's the Usher concert in Las Vegas."

Scott made the brief remarks about the game during an event announcing a plan to combat poverty.
Taylor Swift was spotted at the game, supporting her boyfriend, Kansas City TE Travis Kelce.
