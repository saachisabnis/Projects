The Taylor Swift Effect
Since the launch of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in the USA 17th March 2023, the travel industry is seeing a significant shift in consumer behaviour for searches to concert destinations around the world. Opodo reveals how “The Taylor Effect” continues to take root with her shows for 2024.
Opodo has looked at searches to cities over the dates of Taylor Swift events in 2024 and compared these to searches to the same cities over the same dates last year. This data reveals that searches for Stockholm have increased almost five-fold (+473%) year on year for 17-19 May. Searches for Warsaw increased +339% over her August tour dates in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Searches for Edinburgh and Liverpool over the 7th-15th June have grown +176% and +133% respectively. Finally, searches for Paris over Swift’s May tour dates show a bounce year on year of  +108%.
Beyond these top five cities, others  enjoying ‘the Taylor Swift effect’ include  Zurich (+76%), Lyon (+67%), Milan (+57%), Amsterdam (+50%) and Vienna (+46%). Notably, it continues to drive Americans abroad: US travellers lead the board globally for  the most searches over concert dates to Paris, Madrid, Dublin, Amsterdam, Zurich, Hamburg and London.
How does the Swift effect reveal itself in the UK? Brits take the leaderboard for the most searches for travel to Lisbon, Warsaw, Edinburgh and Cardiff over her tour dates.
Australians willing to make a long-haul Taylor Swift pilgrimage, on the other hand, are heading to London over any other Swift-tour destination. Aussies rank 2nd for searches to travel to London over her dates there (21- 23 June), behind first-place interest from Americans.
Which other artists might replicate ‘the Swift effect’? Bad Bunny with his latest North American tour? Or perhaps Lauryn Hill’s 25th anniversary tour of her wildly successful album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
