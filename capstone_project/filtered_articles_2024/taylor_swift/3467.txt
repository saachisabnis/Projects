It is just over two months until global superstar Taylor Swift makes her return to Dublin for her sold-out Eras Tour.
The Cruel Summer singer is coming to the Aviva Stadium to perform her three-and-a-half-hour set for three nights from June 28-30.
For Swifties who survived the 'Great War' last year and were able to secure tickets for her upcoming shows, Ticketmaster has confirmed a promoter ticket policy has been updated which could have seen fans miss out - despite having tickets.

The Eras Tour in Dublin was previously confirmed as a 'lead booker' event meaning the person who purchased the ticket must attend the show for entry to be valid.
For example, if the cardholder purchased tickets for their children or as a gift, they must be present at the show as well as they could not be passed on.
Earlier this week, it was confirmed that this policy has now been removed as fans with tickets for the Dublin shows received an email update from Ticketmaster.
It read: "Hi there, We’re reaching out in case you were not already aware, to remind you that the terms and conditions relating to Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour shows taking place in Ireland this summer, have been updated by the promoter.
“The ‘lead booker’ policy has been removed, meaning that the person whose name is on the Ticketmaster account used to purchase tickets is no longer required to attend the event.
“All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. We hope you enjoy the show!”
