Travis Kelce
Fans of celebrity couple Travis Kelce, who plays the tight end position for the Kansas City Chiefs, and Taylor Swift, award-winning singer-songwriter, are eager to see their red carpet debut, leaving many hoping the upcoming Grammys will be the venue.
So, will Kelce be attending the star-studded award show to support his girlfriend, who has six nominations this year?
Unfortunately, it's not looking likely, and fans will probably have to wait a little while longer for the two to grace a red carpet with a glam couple moment.
Kelce was seemingly booked for a work gig the same night, as the Grammys are taking place in Los Angeles, California, this year, on Sunday, Feb. 4, while Kelce was expected to attend the 2024 Pro Bowl Games atÂ Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, on the same day.
Kelce was picked as part of the 2023 AFC Pro Bowl team, while his older brother, Jason Kelce, is a part of this year's NFC Pro Bowl team. The event starts with a Skills Showdown on Thursday, Feb. 1, with the highly-anticipated flag football game on Sunday.

However, according toÂ SI, players who make it to the Super Bowl historically have passed on their chances to participate in Pro Bowl festivitiesâ€”meaning that he's unlikely to play on the 4th. However, seeing as his brother, Jason, has also been invited to play, he may still fly out to support him, if he's not too busyÂ squeezing in some additional practice.
Meanwhile, Swift is still one to watch on the Grammys red carpet, as fans wonder if she will be taking home any awards that night.Â In 2023, Swift won the Grammy for Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film, which she directed.
This year, Swift is nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Midnights, along with Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance for "Anti-Hero." Swift also has a nomination for her song "Karma" with Ice Spice for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
