March on Disney+ really runs the gamut. If you want your Marvel super heroes, you get the premiere of X-Men ’97, a sequel series to the beloved X-Men cartoon show from the 1990s that helped build interest in and out of Hollywood for the first live-action X-Men movie. And at the other end of the spectrum you’ve also got the streaming premiere of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. What a double feature those two would make together.
There’s also more episodes of Star Wars: The Bad Batch, and the Disney+ premiere of Morbius. Yes, all this and it’s Morbin’ time in March. What a month to stream.
