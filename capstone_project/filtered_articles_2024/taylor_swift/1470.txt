BERKS COUNTY, Pa. (WHP) — Penn State Berks is offering a brand new course, highlighting Taylor Swift as a means to educate students on the arts and sciences as well as women's studies.
The university states the course will "take the unique approach of examining Swift’s cultural and musical impact and her portrayal in the media, rather than focusing on Swift’s marketing strategies or how her lyrics fit into literary canon like other universities' courses on the singer."
The class, titled "Taylor Swift, Gender, and Communication," was developed and will be taught by Michele Ramsey, associate professor of communication arts and sciences and of women's gender and sexuality studies.
Other universities who have developed courses on the pop star including Brigham Young University and the University of South Carolina.
The class will then meet as a whole one day each week to discuss the week's content.
