	Super Bowl 2024 has come and gone, but the big game has left an everlasting impression, from Usher’s halftime show to its star-studded attendance. (If you missed it, you still have an opportunity to watch the big game here.) Among the celebrities in attendance was none other than Taylor Swift, who flew from her Tokyo leg of the Eras Tour to cheer on her boyfriend and tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce.

	The “Anti-Hero” singer rooted for the Chiefs alongside her family and friends including Ice Spice, Blake Lively, RIOTUSA and Lana Del Rey in a trendy game day look.
