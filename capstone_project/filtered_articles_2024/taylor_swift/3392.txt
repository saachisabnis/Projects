Not much has changed for Brittany and Patrick Mahomes in the last 12 years! The high school sweethearts have a long history together, which the mother of two highlighted on her Instagram Stories on Monday. 
Posting a recent snap of herself laughing and squeezing her husband's cheeks, Brittany shared the image alongside a throwback of herself and the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback doing the same pose in high school. 
In the throwback photo, Brittany is rocking braces, pale blue eye shadow, and a hot pink headband and bracelet. The teenage Patrick looks unamused by his future wife's antics. 
"Who knew 12 years later we would be where we are at!" Brittany wrote. "This life with you," she added with a wide-eyed and heart emojis, tagging Patrick. 
Brittany and Patrick met at Whitehouse High School in East Texas when Patrick was a sophomore and Brittany was a junior. They tied the knot in 2022. The couple has been together amidst Patrick's rise to fame playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. The athlete has gone on to help his team win a total of three Super Bowl championship games. They have also welcomed daughter Sterling, 3, and son Bronze, 1.
In recent months, Brittany has also been spotted getting friendly with Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The two supportive ladies have been spotted cheering on their partners from the Chiefs' private box. 
In December, an onlooker shared with ET that Brittany and Patrick went on a double date with Taylor and Travis. 
"Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Brittany and Patrick Mahomes, and Blake and Lyndsay Bell all enjoyed a night out at Miracle Pop Up Bar in Kansas City on Friday night," an onlooker confirmed to ET. "They were in a semi-private area of the venue and all enjoyed a great evening."
