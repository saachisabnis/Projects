TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Steelers plus-11; Bills plus-2.
STEELERS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Mason Rudolph’s unlikely late-season emergence helped Pittsburgh rip off three straight wins to reach the playoffs for the 11th time in coach Mike Tomlin’s 17 seasons. Rudolph is set to be a free agent in the offseason and how he plays on Sunday could go a long way toward determining his future in Pittsburgh or elsewhere.
BILLS PLAYER TO WATCH: With WR Gabriel Davis’ status uncertain because of a knee injury, look for Khalil Shakir to take on an even bigger role in the Josh Allen-led passing attack. Shakir’s stock has already been rising over the past three games, in which he’s combined for 13 catches for 198 yards, and coming off a six-catch, 105-yard outing against Miami.
KEY MATCHUP: The Bills defensive front vs. Steelers RB tandem of Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. In closing the season by winning five straight, Buffalo is allowing an average of 96 yards rushing, but has given up six TDs rushing. Harris has heated up in combining for 312 yards rushing and four scores in his past three, with Warren contributing 132 yards rushing and a score over the same span.
KEY INJURIES: The Steelers will be without star OLB T.J. Watt. The NFL’s sack leader is out with a left knee injury sustained in the season finale at Baltimore. Rookie Nick Herbig and veteran Markus Golden will fill in. Pittsburgh is optimistic safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (knee) will return after missing the past three games. ... Buffalo’s depleted defense could be missing two more key players with CB Rasul Douglas (knee) and S Taylor Rapp (calf) not practicing on Wednesday. Douglas indicated he could have returned after being hurt against Miami. WR Davis’ status bears monitoring after he hurt his knee last weekend. LT Dion Dawkins is expected to play after requiring stitches to close a deep cut on his hand last weekend.
SERIES NOTES: The Bills have won three of four, including a 38-3 rout in their most recent meeting in which Allen threw four touchdown passes, and Buffalo totaled 552 yards. The outing was Kenny Pickett’s first career start, in which he went 34 of 52 for 327 yards and an interception, with a majority of his production coming in the second half, which began with Pittsburgh trailing 31-3. ... The winning team in each of their three playoff meetings has gone on to reach the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh beat Buffalo in the divisional round in 1974 on its way to winning its first Super Bowl title. Buffalo beat Pittsburgh in the 1992 season divisional round, before going on to lose its third of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances. And the Steelers beat Buffalo in the divisional round of the ‘95 season playoffs, before going on to lose to Dallas in the Super Bowl.
STATS AND STUFF: Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin and Buffalo coach Sean McDermott were college teammates at William & Mary in 1993 and ‘94. McDermott has a 3-1 edge against Tomlin. ... The Steelers are looking for their first postseason victory since the divisional round in 2016. They’ve dropped four straight playoff games since and their seven-year postseason victory drought is the franchise’s longest since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. ... While Rudolph has helped spark one of the NFL’s worst offenses down the stretch, the running game is what has powered the Steelers over the final three weeks. Pittsburgh is averaging 156.7 yards on the ground over its past three games and will likely try to lean heavily on it with gusty winds and temperatures in the 20s expected. Steeler RBs Harris and Warren both topped 1,000 yards of total offense this season, the first time Pittsburgh has had a pair of backs reach that mark since Walter Abercrombie and Earnest Jackson in 1986. ... Herbig, a fourth-round pick, has been a solid contributor in a smaller role. That role will expand with Watt out. The Steelers have struggled without the all-time leading sacker in franchise history during his seven-year career. Pittsburgh is 1-10 when Watt isn’t in the lineup since he was drafted in 2017, including their 2022 loss at Buffalo. ... The Steelers’ 62 playoff games are the most in the NFL since the merger. Pittsburgh’s 36 postseason wins are tied with San Francisco and New England for tops in the league over that span. The Steelers, however, are just 6-7 in the wild-card round, including losses to Kansas City in 2021 and Cleveland in 2020. ... Tomlin is 8-9 in the playoffs but just 3-7 since the Steelers reached the 2010 Super Bowl against Green Bay. ... Pittsburgh managed to get into the playoffs despite an offense that struggled most of the season thanks in part to taking care of the ball. The Steelers committed just 16 turnovers in 17 games, the third fewest in the NFL and the team’s fewest in a season since 1990. Pittsburgh’s plus-11 turnover margin tied with New Orleans for third best in the NFL. ... Rudolph’s biggest impact has been his ability to get the ball down the field. He is averaging a healthy 9.7 yards per attempt since becoming the starter, with each of his three touchdown passes going for 61 or more yards. ... The Steelers took the unusual step of practicing at Acrisure Stadium this week in an effort to mimic the feeling of the turf they will play on in Buffalo. ... The Bills are 5-1 against the playoff field, and the hottest team entering the postseason having won five straight. It marks the fourth straight year Buffalo has won at least four straight entering the playoffs. ... Buffalo is making its fifth straight playoff appearance and sixth in seven years under McDermott, who took over in 2017. Before McDermott’s arrival, Buffalo endured a 17-season playoff drought. ... Allen finished the season leading the NFL with 44 touchdowns (29 passing/15 rushing), but ranked 32nd with a career-worst 18 interceptions. Allen has a career record of 38-26 in regular-season games he commits a turnover, and is 1-3 in eight playoff appearances. ... With 107 catches for 1,183 yards, WR Stefon Diggs is the NFL’s third player to have four or more consecutive seasons with 100 catches, joining Antonio Brown (2013-18) and Marvin Harrison (1999-2002). ... Buffalo opened the season 2-6 in games decided by seven points or fewer, before finishing 6-6. ... In its past four outings, Buffalo has allowed allowed 64 first downs and giving up an average 259 yards. Opponents have converted just 27 of 81 third down opportunities over the same span. ... Since 2019, Buffalo is 21-2 against quarterbacks with 16 or fewer career starts. Those QBs have combined for 12 TDs passing, thrown 34 interceptions and been sacked 70 times.

PHILADELPHIA (11-6) AT TAMPA BAY (9-8)
Monday, 8:15 p.m. EST, ESPN, ABC
AGAINST THE SPREAD: Eagles 8-8-1; Buccaneers 11-5-1.
SERIES RECORD: Tied 11-11, including postseason.
LAST MEETING: Eagles beat Buccaneers 25-11 in Tampa on Sept. 25, 2023.
LAST WEEK: Eagles lost on road to New York Giants 27-10; Buccaneers won 9-0 at Carolina.
EAGLES OFFENSE: OVERALL (8), RUSH (8), PASS (16), SCORING (7).
EAGLES DEFENSE: OVERALL (26), RUSH (10), PASS (31), SCORING (30).
BUCCANEERS OFFENSE: OVERALL; (23), RUSH (32), PASS (17), SCORING (20).
BUCCANEERS DEFENSE: OVERALL (23), RUSH (5), PASS (29), SCORING (7).
TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Eagles minus-10; Buccaneers plus-8.
EAGLES PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Jalen Hurts injured the middle finger on his throwing hand during Philadelphia’s regular-season finale against the New York Giants, raising questions about how effective he will be Monday night. In addition to throwing for careers highs of 3,858 yards and 23 touchdowns, he also rushed for 15 TDs. He’s led the Eagles into the playoffs the past three seasons and has accounted for nine TDs — five rushing, four passing — in four career games, including last year’s Super Bowl.
BUCCANEERS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Baker Mayfield is back in the playoffs for the first time since 2020, when he was with Cleveland, and has made the most of his opportunity to revive his career as the successor to Tom Brady in Tampa Bay. He’s completed 64% of his passes for career single-season bests of 4,044 yards and 28 touchdowns while minimizing costly turnovers that hindered him in previous stops with the Browns, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams.
KEY MATCHUP: Bucs WRs Mike Evans and Chris Godwin vs. Eagles CBs Darius Slay and James Bradberry. Philadelphia lost five of six down the stretch following a 10-1 start to the season. A leaky defense shares responsibility. The Eagles ranked 31st in pass defense, allowing 252.7 yards per game. Evans (1,255) and Godwin (1,024) are one of three sets of teammates who each had more than 1,000 yards receiving in 2022 and 2023. The others are Miami’s Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and Philadelphia’s A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. Evans tied Hill for the NFL lead in TD catches with 13. He had nine receptions for 117 yards and a TD when the Bucs beat the Eagles in the playoffs two years ago.
KEY INJURIES: Eagles QB Jalen Hurts (right finger) isn’t the only player who’s banged up heading into the postseason. WR A.J. Brown (knee), WR DeVonta Smith, S Reed Blankenship (groin), RB D’Andre Swift (illness) and CB Darius Slay (knee) are on the Eagles injury report this week, though Smith, Swift and Slay were listed as full participants in practice. Hurts was limited early in the week but will play. Brown was officially ruled out on Saturday. Tampa Bay’s injury report includes Mayfield (ribs, ankle) and LT Tristan Wirfs (illness). They were listed as nonparticipants early in the week but will play. “Everybody is good to go,” coach Todd Bowles said Saturday.
SERIES NOTES: While the Eagles lead the regular-season series 9-8, the Bucs hold a 3-2 edge in the playoffs, including the past two. Ronde Barber’s 92-yard interception return in the 2002 NFC championship game in Philadelphia clinched Tampa Bay’s first trip to the Super Bowl, while Tom Brady beat Hurts and the Eagles in a NFC wild-card game in Tampa two years ago. Back-to-back road playoff losses to Philadelphia in 2000 and 2001 were a major factor in Tampa Bay’s decision to fire Tony Dungy as coach after that second meeting. Jon Gruden led the Bucs to their first NFL title the following season.
STATS AND STUFF: Hurts led the Eagles to a dominating 14-point victory over the Bucs in a Week 3 prime-time matchup in Tampa. The Eagles QB threw for 277 yards and one touchdown and also ran for a TD. Philadelphia rushed for 201 yards, with RB D’Andre Swift (18 carries, 130 yards) doing much of the damage. The Eagles ran 78 plays to Tampa Bay’s 44 and outgained the Bucs 472 yards to 174. Philadelphia led 25-3 before the Bucs finally got into the end zone with 9:22 remaining, then ran out the clock to end the game. … Swift finished fifth in the league in rushing with 1,049 yards and had a career-best 1,263 yards from scrimmage. … Brown led the Eagles with a career-high 106 receptions for 1,456 yards and seven TDs. Smith had 81 catches for 1,066 yards and seven TDs. … Eagles LB Hassan Riddick had 11 sacks and 13 tackles for loss. He and Cleveland’s Myles Garrett are the only players with 10-plus sacks each of the past four seasons. … The Buccaneers are the only NFC team that’s appeared in the playoffs each of the past four seasons. Kansas City and Buffalo are the only AFC teams that have done that. … The Chiefs have the most playoff wins (seven) since 2020. The Bucs are second with five, with Tom Brady at QB. … The Tampa Bay defense has 16 postseason takeaways over the past three years, most in the NFL. … Bucs rookies Yaya Diaby and Calijah Kancey combined for 22 tackles for loss, 20 quarterback hits and 11 1/2 sacks this season. … Bucs S Antoine Winfield, Jr. was the NFC defensive player of the month for December/January. He’s one of four players since 2000 who’ve had five-plus sacks, five-plus takeaways and five-plus forced fumbles in the same season. The others are T.J. Watt, Justin Tuck and Terrell Suggs.
