Taylor Swift
The Super Bowl is right around the corner, and people everywhere have been asking one burning question about the big game: is Taylor Swift going to make it?
Fans haven't been so sure if Swift will be able to travel to Las Vegas to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce play in the Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs, as the "Cruel Summer" songstress is scheduled to perform a concert in Tokyo, Japan, the night before.
While Swifties have been doing the math to see if the Grammy-winner has enough time to make it back to the U.S. for the game, some have been worried that she might miss the Chiefs taking on the San Francisco 49ers—or worse, that she might rush her concert in order to make it there on time.
But on Friday, Feb. 2, the Japanese embassy sent out a statement to reassure everyone that it is totally possible for Swift to make it back in plenty of time, as long as she hops on a plane right after her show.
"The Embassy of Japan in the United States is aware of recent media reports concerning the steps Taylor Swift will need to take to travel from Tokyo after her concert on February 10th to Las Vegas in time to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play in Super Bowl LVIII," began the statement, issued via X (formerly Twitter).
"Despite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now to say that if she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins."

"We know that many people in Japan are excited to experience Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, so we wanted to confirm that anyone concerned can be Fearless in knowing that this talented performer can wow Japanese audiences and still make it to Las Vegas to support the Chiefs when they take the field for the Super Bowl wearing Red," the statement—which was sprinkled with references to Swift's albums—concluded.
Swift's upcoming shows in Japan mark her first time back on tour since November 2023. After just a few months off, Swift will make a return to stage at the Tokyo Dome on Wednesday, Feb. 7, and is scheduled to play three additional shows on that Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
