A Gretsch White Falcon guitar autographed by Harry is expected to sell for $3,000 to $5,000. Harry also donated a signed CD copy of his self-titled debut album to the auction: That’s expected to go for $300 to $500.
Meanwhile, a Taylor Swift Baby Taylor Signature model acoustic guitar donated and signed, but not played, by Taylor is expected to sell for $1,000 to $1500.
An autographed copy of Sam Smith‘s debut album, In the Lonely Hour; an autographed copy of Lady Gaga‘s 2020 album, Chromatica; a custom Lionel Richie jacket that says “All Night Long” on the back; and an autographed Stevie Nicks Barbie Doll are among the other items going on the block at the auction.
