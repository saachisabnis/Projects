The Comeback: Today’s Top Sports Stories & Reactions
Over the past several months, global pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have become arguably the most high-profile couple on the planet. And it sounds like the couple is planning to take their relationship to the next level this summer.
According to a report from Page Six, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are planning to get engaged this summer with a source telling the outlet that “Taylor and Travis discussed it and there is a plan” and that the current buzz is that “they will get engaged on their one-year anniversary in July.”
“There are rumors the pair held off from having Kelce pop the question over the winter holidays because ‘they don’t want it to seem like it’s rushed insanity,'” Mara Siegler reported for Page Six. “Our source also said he won’t go down on one knee for Valentine’s Day for the same reason.”
Obviosuly, this news caused quite a reaction on social media.
