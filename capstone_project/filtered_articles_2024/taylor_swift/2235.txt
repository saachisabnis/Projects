This is the Ron DeSantis that seems to have his finger on the pulse of America.
In a matter of days, the Governor of Florida posted multiple damning messages to Joe Biden on X, spotlighting his refusal to release the federal government’s Epstein files and his refusal to close the border and get tougher on illegal aliens–especially Jose Antonio Ibarra, Laken Riley’s murderer and a released convict. This, in addition to his signing of HB 117, which allows for the public release of grand jury documents related to notorious child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, going all the way back to a 2006 investigation.

Why won’t Biden release the federal government’s Epstein files? https://t.co/mkafel41bD

The combination of open borders and sanctuary and soft-on-crime policies is deadly.  The illegal alien who murdered Laken Riley had recently been arrested in NY — and then released. https://t.co/afdw19X7om

While the focus of this piece is child trafficking, I conflate the issue with the heinous Laken Riley murder and illegal aliens because it is clear that DeSantis’s messaging has been strong this week and momentum is ever-important in information war. Not to mention child trafficking is raging as we speak at the southern border.
Admittedly, as I have argued just a couple of days ago, so much more needs to be done in the way of public outcry about the despicable acts the Epsteins of the world do to young children. But, and it is a big but, it is good to see another public official drawing attention to this absolute wicked reality of our time, a reality Donald Trump is fighting as well.
Thank you, Governor DeSantis.
Incidentally, these developments have occurred in a week when one of pop’s most visible figures in Sean “Diddy” Combs is under hell’s fire yet again for being a kingpin in this entire depraved sexual empire. Likely government psy-op Taylor Swift is also being accused by another pop star of performing demonic rituals on stage unbeknownst to her adoring fans. A lot of celebrities are feeling the pinch right now because a lot of information is dribbling out all at once, it seems. The crimes against children go well beyond underage sex–and that of course would be plenty bad enough.
These people in entertainment–the ones our children are listening to–are in a cult. They sell their souls. They have been sucked into the world of child trafficking and torture and are blackmailed into staying in that world because of the things they’ve done to attain fame. That is the difficult truth we are going to have to come to terms with at some point. And that is only going to happen if the leaders who both inspire us and have the clout to move and shake on this issue rally the cause. Small-timers like me can only do so much.
DeSantis stepped up big this week.
Trump could stand to be a little inspired by DeSantis’s lead and the momentum of such narrative convergence with the pop world. Yes, Epstein Island was shut down during his presidency and he did more than any other president to fight human trafficking, but it is time he ramps up the rhetoric again. It doesn’t matter how many children are being saved right now in secret (as is supposedly the case, thank God). It is the American people who need to be riled up enough to demand justice of the perpetrators. It is the court of public opinion that always pushes the needle of every narrative in this country.
What Trump has that DeSantis doesn’t is inspiration and power with the people. He is the beat up, flawed hero in this segment of American history that sometimes seems more like a movie. The people relate to him. He is us, he is our frustration and anger with the federal government. And when that emotion meets the type of heady legislative and executive moves coming out of Florida, the Deep State child torturers won’t stand a chance.
“The public deserves to know who participated in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking,” DeSantis said. “Nobody should be protected from facing justice due to their wealth or status, and those who harm children should be exposed and punished to the fullest extent of the law.”

“Palm Beach County and the victims suffered from Epstein’s vile behavior before the world ever knew his name,” said Representative Peggy Gossett-Seidman. “I followed the story as we parents kept our kids close, but we never stopped seeking the truth. The police investigated relentlessly, and now the Governor opens up the last chapter of this sordid story.”
Here are even more details from DeSantis’s Florida Governor site:
After a 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the State Attorney to charge Epstein with multiple felony charges, including unlawful sexual activity with a minor and lewd or lascivious molestation. Rather than charge Epstein directly, the State Attorney at the time chose to present evidence to a grand jury—ensuring the names of those involved and the details of the accusations were kept sealed.
HB 117 will allow disclosure of grand jury testimony if the following conditions are met:

The subject of the grand jury inquiry is dead.
The investigation was about sexual activity with a minor.
The testimony was previously disclosed by a court order.
The state attorney is notified.

Because all the above apply to the Jeffrey Epstein Florida case, this legislation will authorize release of the Epstein grand jury documents when it takes effect on July 1, 2024.
Smart government.
The rebel yell of an American people pissed off about all things federal government and protecting its most vulnerable.
It is a combination even the legions of hell cannot overcome, with God Almighty blessing us for our righteous protest against tyranny, of course.
Thankfully, Trump was talking about this evil long before now. Back in 2015 with Sean Hannity when he implicated Clinton and Epstein. Back in 2012 when he tweeted about the death penalty for the pedophiles. Back in 2009 when he was the only one to cooperate with the Florida prosecutor in his investigation of Epstein. Epstein is “Epstein” and all that word now entails largely because of Trump, and that is commendable. But the People’s President needs to join the DeSantises of the country now in this war of all wars for the children. Such potential dual firepower was one reason we were waiting for DeSantis to drop from the Presidential race in the first place.

May everyone named directly or referenced indirectly ask forgiveness and do penance for their sins against America and God. I fight this information war in the spirit of justice and love for the innocent, but I have been reminded of the need for mercy and prayers for our enemies. I am a sinner in need of redemption as well after all, for my sins are many. In the words of Jesus Christ himself, Lord forgive us all, for we know not what we do.
