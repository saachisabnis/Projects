The Fair's first announced headliner is fun for the whole family!
The Wisconsin State Fair is right around the corner! (*looks outside at a foot of snow and 10-degree temperatuers*) OK, maybe not RIGHT around the corner – but the late summer spectacular is slowly yet surely en route! And to help encourage warm thoughts and summer vibes, the State Fair today announced their first Main Stage headlining act: the return of Kidz Bop Live on Tuesday, Aug. 6. 

Coming back to the State Fair for its third straight year, the Kidz Bop Live 2024 tour will bring a brand new show to the stage, performing kid-approved covers of some of the past year's hottest songs – including the likes of Taylor Swift hits "Karma" and "Cruel Summer," Dua Lipa's "Dance the Night" and much more. 









Tickets for the Kidz Bop State Fair show will go on sale to the public Friday, Jan. 26 at 10 a.m. at the Wisconsin State Fair's website. Reserved seating tickets will range in cost from $30, $35 and $40. For more information, click here. 

And for more State Fair updates and announcements – including some new cream puff flavors cooked up in March for St. Patrick's Day – stay tuned to OnMilwaukee.

As much as it is a gigantic cliché to say that one has always had a passion for film, Matt Mueller has always had a passion for film. Whether it was bringing in the latest movie reviews for his first grade show-and-tell or writing film reviews for the St. Norbert College Times as a high school student, Matt is way too obsessed with movies for his own good.
When he's not writing about the latest blockbuster or talking much too glowingly about "Piranha 3D," Matt can probably be found watching literally any sport (minus cricket) or working at - get this - a local movie theater. Or watching a movie. Yeah, he's probably watching a movie.
