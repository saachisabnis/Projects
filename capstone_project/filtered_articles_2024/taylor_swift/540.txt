A jeweler is making Travis Kelce a tempting offer, but it comes with a catch.
Steven Singer Jewelers, which is based in Philadelphia, is offering the Kansas City Chiefs star tight end a $1 million engagement ring for Taylor Swift.
Kelce has not made any announcement about getting engaged to Swift, but the couple’s relationship continues to get stronger and everyone has been paying attention. For Singer, the ring is a way to honor the “most renowned couple globally.”
“I recognize that the most renowned couple globally has an abundance of options when it comes to choosing engagement rings, should they decide to tie the knot,” said Steven Singer, via Page Six.
“If they do, I would be honored to help design a truly extraordinary ring exclusively for them.”
Singer noted that his daughter is a huge Taylor Swift fan and he’s hoping the ring could make it easier to secure her a pricey concert tickets.
“My daughter is an avid fan of Taylor Swift, and we admire not only her but also the values she champions,” he added. “Perhaps, by presenting them with the ring of their dreams, it might make securing concert tickets for her next tour a tad easier.”
It seems like a win-win situation.
Of course, Kelce could easily afford an engagement ring for Swift on his own, but Singer is doing the smart thing by getting his name out there. You can never get enough free promo.
