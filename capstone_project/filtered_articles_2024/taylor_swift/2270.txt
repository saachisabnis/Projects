If you can't get enough of Taylor Swift (and who can't?), you've got plenty on the way. The singer announced a third and final limited special edition of The Tortured Poets Department, her upcoming album.
It'll be themed around a bonus track called The Black Dog, Variety reports. This all came to light as Swift wrapped up a gig in Singapore. There, she performed a mashup that included Evermore's Long Story Short and The Story of Us, Billboard mentions.
“I kind of wanted to show you something that nobody else has seen,” she addressed the Singapore audience before showing everyone The Black Dog.
Though not much about the song, it does refer to depression and melancholy. Plus, she hinted at a possible lyric in a social post. There, she wrote, “Old habit die screaming…”
The post has a couple of black-and-white photos of the star and a link to her website to order the unique edition album. The vinyl edition is only available through the link and expires Wednesday at 2 pm.
