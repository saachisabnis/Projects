We love a supportive couple! Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce‘s relationship has brought some of the most iconic IT Couple moments in the modern age. However, it’s surprising that the couple hasn’t made their red carpet or awards show debut yet. Will they finally do it at the Grammys? 
Taylor is a veteran artist at the prestigious awards show. She’s been nominated for a total of fifty eight times and has won fourteen awards. She was first nominated in 2008 for Best New Artist and at one point of time, she was once nominated for eight Grammys at a single awards show. This year, she’s nominated for six awards. Her album The Tortured Poets Department was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Album, her song “Fortnight” (featuring Post Malone) was nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Music Video, and her feature on Gracie Abrams’ “Us” got nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

It’s a pretty monumental year for Taylor, but will her boyfriend come along?
It’s highly unlikely that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end will attend the 68th Annual Grammy Awards. When the Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl in 2024, he confirmed that his schedule didn’t allow him to go to the awards ceremony. “I wish I could go support Taylor at the Grammys, and watch her win every single award that she’s nominated for,” he said on The Pat McAfee Show.“But I think I’ve got practice on Sunday. Unfortunately, I’ve gotta get ready for this big old Super Bowl that we’ve got in a week.”
The same schedule is lined up this year, with the Chiefs going head-to-head with the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9. If they win this year, the Chiefs will have scored a three-peat—winning the Super Bowl three years in a row. It’s a feat that’s never been done in NFL history. It’s no wonder that Travis would want to focus all his energy on that!
As for whether Taylor Swift will attend Super Bowl LIX, we are certain that the “Miss Americana” singer will watch her boyfriend from the bleachers. She’s already done so when he won the AFC Championships just a couple weeks before. Last year, it was heavily debated that Taylor would make an appearance since she was in the middle of her Eras Tour and across the Pacific Ocean in Japan. Even though she had a show the day before the Super Bowl, she braved through the plane ride and arrived in the Las Vegas heat. Taylor’s Eras Tour concluded on December 8, 2024, so her schedule is clear for football’s big day. We might even see an on-field Super Bowl winning smooch again!
