 Vanessa and Nick Lachey are celebrating their little girl on her special day.

 On Friday, the Love Is Blind co-hosts and real-life couple shared an adorable series of photos on Instagram in celebration of their daughter Brooklyn's 9th birthday. In the first photo, Brooklyn smiles in a birthday crown on her first birthday.

 In the second shot, the newly minted 9-year-old holds up her hands in a heart and poses by the water at sunset.

 "Brooklyn Elisabeth Lachey, from 1 to 9 in the blink of an eye. Happy Birthday to our Baby Girl. ❤️," the couple wrote in their joint caption.

 In August, Nick, 50, and Vanessa, 43, enjoyed a night out with daughter Brooklyn at Taylor Swift's Eras tour. Before attending the show, the three Lacheys stopped by the SoFi and PEOPLE Taylor Swift pre-concert party, posing together for a sweet family photo.

 In one snap, the proud parents placed their hands on their daughter's shoulders as the three of them smiled at the camera. In another photo, Vanessa and Brooklyn wore matching denim jackets with "Lachey" written across the back.

 Vanessa later carried a sleepy Brooklyn as they stood by a railing. Decked out in their denim jackets, the mother-daughter duo shared a sweet moment before the Taylor Swift show.

 On her Instagram, Vanessa posted another adorable photo with Brooklyn, with the two putting their hands together to make a heart.

 "🫶🏽 @taylorswift A night we will remember forever! Thank you @sofi & @people for this incredible moment! A core memory was created for SURE! 👯‍♀️🪩🤠," she wrote in the caption.

 Earlier that summer, the family of five enjoyed a family vacation to Kiawah Island, where Vanessa shared a sweet photo of her family on Instagram. The picture showed herself and Nick with all three of their kids and their extended family.

 "Party of 10!!!" the NCIS Hawaii actress captioned her photo.

 "2 families, 6 kids, LOTS of laughs & good times!!! We love our Christensen Family and the Kiawah Island/Charleston hangs," she continued. "(Fun fact, I went to school here 6-12th grade!) Summer fun going strong, lots of QT! ❤️ Now on to the next stop #LacheyPartyof5."
