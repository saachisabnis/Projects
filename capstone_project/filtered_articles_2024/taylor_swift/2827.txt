	During Taylor Swift’s six year romance with Joe Alwyn, he helped her out by co-writing a few of her iconic songs. And because of this, he’s making bank.

	










	While Swift’s upcoming album The Tortured Poets Department, has fans excited for a potential few diss tracks to Alwyn, it’s clear he won’t react to it, and that he probably doesn’t care since he’s racked in literal millions. An inside source told Life & Style that “Fair or not, it’s made him a very rich guy. Joe is making so much on royalties and returns from [Taylor’s] Eras tour that he doesn’t ever need to worry about money again.”

	For those who need a reminder, he is credited as a songwriter on the songs “Exhile,” “Betty,” “Champagne Problems,” “Coney Island, “Evermore,” and “Sweet Nothing.” So he helped out with quite a few songs across three albums, and by doing so, he’s getting so much money (and even won a Grammy from it).

	The same outlet estimated that Alwyn had made at least $2.3 million in streams alone.



	According to Celebrity Net Worth, the actor has a net worth of $4 million. It’s unclear how much he’s made in total from Swift’s projects, but we do know it’s at least $2.3 million, and we do know he’s brought home quite a few big projects from his acting credits.

	For those who don’t know, Swift and Alwyn dated from Sept 2016 to March 2023, and were incredibly private about their relationship.
