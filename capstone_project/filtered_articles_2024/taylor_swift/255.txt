So Jean Milburn of her
If there was anything more iconic at the 2024 Golden Globes than Taylor Swift’s face after Selena Gomez told her that Kylie Jenner wouldn’t let her get a pic with Timothée Chalamet then it was Gillian Anderson’s dress.
Yesterday, icon Gillian Anderson attended the red carpet of the Golden Globes and everyone can’t stop talking about her dress.  From afar, it just kinda looks like a normal, albeit lovely white dress. But when you zoom in you can see that it’s actually covered in vulvas.
Speaking to Deadline on the red carpet she said she wore the dress for “so many reasons. It’s brand-appropriate.” Earlier this year, Gillian launched a brand of wellness soft drinks called G Spot.
Talking to Vogue, she added: “Since my Instagram presence has been highlighting yonis (the Sanskrit word for womb or vagina) since Sex Education landed on Netflix and with the mantra of my brand G-Spot being to prioritise pleasure, I wanted to bring this element into the design… I’m so pleased Gabriela was up for the challenge!”

The dress was designed by Gabriela Hearst and each vulva took around three and a half hours to embroider.
In a post on the designer’s Instagram about the dress Gabriela Hearst said: “Vulvaliciously chic as always. We collaborated with Gillian Andersin in a custom gown for the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards. Gillian wears an ivory wool silk structure cady corset gown with custom embroidery. Made entirely in New York City, the embroidery was crafted in the garment district and the gown was assembled at the in-house studio. Each motif took approximately 3.5 hours to embroider.”

Posting on Insta after the ceremony, Gillian posed in the dress eating a sausage with the caption: “Sometimes you just need a sausage to go with your yoni dress.”
