Is Blackpink's Lisa in our area? On Thursday (Feb 29), several social media accounts posted videos of the Thai singer-rapper at Changi Airport – prompting speculation that the Lalisa singer could be in town to catch Taylor Swift's concert.
An X user by the handle @aripinkcrumbs posted a series of videos and photos showing Lisa interacting with fans at the airport. The 26-year-old K-pop idol even accepted gifts including a yellow Care Bear toy.
According to fans who were present at the airport, Lisa quickly made her way into a van upon landing. It is unknown why Lisa is in Singapore, although some fans are speculating that she might be here to catch one of Taylor Swift's six shows here. Others claim that she might be in town for an event by a luxury brand.
Lisa recently established her own agency Lloud, following the end of her contract with YG Entertainment. Soon, she will also be seen in the third season of HBO's hit series The White Lotus.
