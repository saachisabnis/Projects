Taylor Swift's Eras Tour continued it's international journey on Saturday night in Singapore (morning in the United States). The now 14-time Grammy winner will be touring almost non-stop for the entire year, and at each show she adds two "surprise songs" to her 44-song, three hour plus set list.

For the final night in Singapore, Swift once again went with the mashups that she's been so fond of in 2024. On the guitar, she played a combination of "Tim McGraw" from Taylor Swift and "Cowboy Like Me" from Evermore. On piano, Swift went with a mashup of "Mirrorball" and "Epiphany" from Folklore.
"Tim McGraw" and "Mirrorball" were the songs Swift played at the very first Eras Tour show on March 17 in Glendale, Arizona. That night, she played "Mirrorball" on guitar and "Tim McGraw" on piano.
Swift will now take off from touring in April for the launch of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department. She will restart the Eras Tour in May with stops in Paris, Stockholm, Lisbon and Madrid on the schedule for the month.
