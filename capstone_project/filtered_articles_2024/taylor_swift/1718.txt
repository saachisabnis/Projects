The Tejano music community stands united in grief as we remember the life and legacy of Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a cherished DJ and mother of two. Lisa’s untimely passing during the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade left a void that resonates far beyond the airwaves. But amidst the sorrow, a beacon of compassion shines through: Taylor Swift.
Pop superstar Taylor Swift has extended her hand in support, donating a staggering $100,000 to a GoFundMe campaign set up by Lisa’s family. The campaign was initiated to provide vital financial assistance to Lisa’s loved ones as they grapple with this unthinkable tragedy. Lisa, who hosted the weekly music program “A Taste of Tejano” on KKFI 90.1 FM, touched countless lives with her passion for the genre.
In a heartfelt virtual donation, Taylor Swift expressed her sentiments: “Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. With love, Taylor Swift.” Her words echo the pain felt by Lisa’s family and the entire Tejano community. Two donations of $50,000 each now grace the public list from Swift, propelling the fundraiser beyond its initial goal of $75,000.
Lisa Lopez-Galvan’s brother, Beto Lopez, shared memories of his vibrant sister. “We woke up this morning excited, and the last thing we ever expected was to have a tragedy in our family,” he revealed. Lisa’s love for her family, her bubbly personality, and her dedication to Tejano music defined her. She leaves behind a husband and two young children, a testament to her enduring legacy.
As Lisa’s favorite Tejano tunes continue to play, let us honor her memory. Taylor Swift’s generosity reminds us that music transcends boundaries—it unites hearts, even in times of sorrow. Lisa Lopez-Galvan’s spirit lives on, forever etched in the melodies she spun and the joy she shared.
