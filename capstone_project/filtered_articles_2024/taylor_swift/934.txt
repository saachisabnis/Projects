We all know that the NFL’s AFC Championship weekend is bringing the action—but apparently, the drama is getting personal. Patrick Mahomes’ dad shaded Taylor Swift after recently revealing that he doesn’t plan to share a private box with the pop sensation at the Kansas City Chiefs next game against the Baltimore Ravens.
When asked about sitting with Travis Kelce’s brother and girlfriend in an interview with WFAN Sports Radio’s “Evan & Tiki” show, the 53-year-old cheekily quipped, “I hope not.” He went on to explain his reasoning: “Travis normally has his own thing, and Patrick has his own deal too. I imagine if Taylor wants her own suite, she’s got enough money to get whichever one she wants.”

The AFC showdown will determine who gets a shot at Super Bowl LVIII, and the Chiefs, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce, are set to face off against the Ravens at Maryland’s M&T Bank Stadium.
Taylor has been making headlines for her blossoming romance with Travis since last year. She made her debut appearance at a Chiefs game in September 2023, cheering them on to victory from the Kelce family’s private suite. While Taylor hasn’t confirmed her attendance for Sunday’s game, Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie Kelce, confirmed their plans to cheer on Travis and the Chiefs in person during a recent appearance on Good Morning America.
Most recently, Taylor joined the Kelce crew for the divisional playoff matchup against the Buffalo Bills on January 21, where Jason and Kylie, 31, also made their first appearance in support of Travis. Jason even stole the spotlight with his rowdy antics, stripping off his shirt and pulling a stunt out the window after Travis scored a touchdown.
Pat Mahomes Sr. shared his thoughts about the moment, revealing on the “Evan & Tiki” show, “I was actually two booths down. But as soon as [Jason] started doing that, I started looking down and I saw him. It just so happens that at one point, we were both having a beer in the bathroom. I’ve known him for quite some time because Travis is like another son to me.”
As for his son Patrick Mahomes’ take on Taylor, the Chiefs quarterback seems all for her romance with his teammate. In a sit-down with CBS Mornings’ Nate Burleson in December 2023, Mahomes shared, “At first, I feel like everybody kind of stayed away, let [Kelce] do what he was doing. Then he started bringing Taylor around, and we realized how cool of a person she was. So for us, there was a couple of jokes here and there at the beginning. But now, she’s just part of Chiefs Kingdom. She’s part of the team.”

 









Mahomes also mentioned the close bond between the Grammy winner and his wife, former soccer player Brittany Mahomes. The two ladies frequently share a box suite at Chiefs games, and they’ve spent quality time together in both New York City and Kansas City on multiple occasions. 
“It’s cool that she’s embraced Brittany and they’ve built a friendship as well,” the quarterback shared. “[Kelce is] lucky enough to be with a great girl, and a great woman. She’s top tier at her profession. It’s really cool to hear about and to see, and now I have a first-hand look at that through Brittany and Travis’ eyes.”
He went on to add, “It is really cool. I’m glad she’s the person she is, and she and Travis match so well.”
