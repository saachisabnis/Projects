Since it began publishing weekly in 1956, the Billboard 200 has tracked the best-selling albums in the US.
Today, it's still an impressive feat to reign atop the chart, especially with several different albums.
Only a handful of artists have crossed into double-digit No. 1s, including modern superstars like Taylor Swift and Drake. They're listed below in ascending order.
Editor's note: Although Elvis Presley is often credited with 10 No. 1 albums, a Billboard representative told Business Insider that most of his biggest releases pre-date the modern Billboard 200 chart, which launched in 1963.
Bruce Springsteen's 11 chart-topping albums span over three decades, from 1980's "The River" to 2014's "High Hopes" — even though Springsteen has yet to score a No. 1 hit song on the Hot 100.
Barbra Streisand logged her first No. 1 entry on the Billboard 200 with "People" in 1964.
Fifty-one years later, she set a record for the longest span between No. 1s when "Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway," her 2016 studio album, topped the chart.
Streisand previously had the most No. 1 albums among female artists until Taylor Swift broke her record in 2023.
Ye, who still releases music under the name Kanye West, topped the Billboard 200 for the first time in 2005 with "Late Registration."
He logged his 11th consecutive No. 1 album in 2024 with "Vultures 1," a collaborative effort with Ty Dolla $ign.
When it was released in 2000, Eminem's "The Marshall Mathers LP" sold over 1 million copies in its first week, easily earning a No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200.
Two decades later, "Music to Be Murdered By" debuted at No. 1, becoming Eminem's historic 10th chart-topper. He logged his 11th in 2024 with "The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)."
Future earned his first No. 1 album in 2015 with "DS2," which has since spent over 300 weeks on the Billboard 200.
In 2024, Future's "Mixtape Pluto" debuted atop the chart — his third No. 1 album in just six months and 11th overall.
Earlier that year, Future topped the chart with "We Don't Trust You" and "We Still Don't Trust You," collaborative efforts with Metro Boomin. The former is widely known for reigniting a feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
Jay-Z began collecting No. 1s in 1998 with his third studio album, "Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life." In 2017, he extended his total to 14 with "4:44," setting a record among solo artists.
Jay-Z is also one of the most-awarded artists in Grammy history.
Taylor Swift has only released one album that didn't top the chart: her self-titled debut, which peaked at No. 5 in 2008.
Swift earned her first No. 1 later that same year with "Fearless," which has since been ranked the fourth-biggest album in Billboard 200 history.
Most recently, "The Tortured Poets Department" launched atop the chart in 2024 with Swift's biggest sales week to date. It became her 14th No. 1 album, extending her record for the most among women, and reigned atop the chart for 19 weeks.
Swift has also broken Elvis Presley's record for the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 among all solo artists.
Drake has racked up 14 No. 1 albums in nearly the same number of years, from 2010's "Thank Me Later" to 2025's "$ome $exy $ongs 4 U," a collaborative effort with PartyNextDoor, released one week after Kendrick Lamar's triumphant Super Bowl performance.
Drake's grand total also includes one mixtape ("Care Package"), two more collaborative albums ("What A Time To Be Alive" with Future and "Her Loss" with 21 Savage), and one project mysteriously billed as a playlist ("More Life").
He is currently tied with Taylor Swift and Jay-Z for the most No. 1 albums among solo artists.
The Beatles hold both records for the most No. 1 songs on the Hot 100 and the most No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200. The latter group includes classics like "Revolver" (1966), "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (1967), "Abbey Road" (1969), and their post-breakup compilation "1" (2000).
As a solo musician, Paul McCartney has topped the Billboard 200 eight more times, while John Lennon managed the feat thrice before he died in 1980.
