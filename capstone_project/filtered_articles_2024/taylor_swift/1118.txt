Let’s first start with some background.
In 2020, Swift told Rolling Stone that 13 was her lucky number.
“I was born on the 13th, I turned 13 on Friday the 13th, my first album went gold in 13 weeks,” said Swift. “Also, my first song that ever went number one, it had a 13-second intro, I didn’t even do that on purpose.”
There are other things about the number 13 that Swift has talked about in the past, like sitting in row 13 or seat 13 at award shows when she takes home a big award.
