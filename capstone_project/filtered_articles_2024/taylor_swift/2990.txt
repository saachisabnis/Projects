The celebs are “taking a break from the buzz of their careers.”
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce appear to be enjoying their time off together! And by that, we mean they were spotted looking cute on vacation in some pics posted by celebrity gossip account DeuxMoi.
A quick reminder that Taylor and Travis are both enjoying lengthy breaks from their grueling schedules: The footballer is currently in the NFL offseason after his February Super Bowl win, while the singer has the rest of March and all of April off before resuming her Eras Tour in May. 
Prior to their vacation, the couple was seen spending a buncha time together in Los Angeles, during which a source told Us Weekly, “They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together. They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed.”
The insider also noted that the celebs were taking “a break from the buzz of their careers” and were busy hosting “small, intimate gatherings” with Taylor’s inner circle. 
“They can finally rest and intend on spending quality time together and with friends and family,” the source revealed before adding that Tay and Trav were organizing their respective schedules so “they can see each other as much as possible” since they “don’t want to spend too much time apart.”
Oh, and this person *also* claimed that “toward the end of the month, they’re still talking about going on a private vacation where no one can find them before her new album drops,” which they were c-l-e-a-r-l-y right about based on these pics!
