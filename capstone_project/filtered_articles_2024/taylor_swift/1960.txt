Let’s be honest: Taylor Swift is no conservative. From her endorsement of Democrat Joe Biden in his 2020 presidential race to her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce of the now-irritatingly woke National Football League, the 34-year-old billionairess singer-songwriter can drive the right flank of the political spectrum crazy.
Ms. Swift obviously has great fashion sense, but she offers something more: a look that is sexy and attractive but also tasteful and refined. Even when she is wearing something casual—denim shorts and a T-shirt, or a miniskirt and lug-sole boots—she looks carefully put-together, with understated accessories and a simple hairstyle that complements the outfit. She projects wholesomeness, a sophisticated version of the girl next door—the girl a guy might ask out on a formal date instead of a hangout session, and maybe, ultimately, marry and make the mother of his children.
It’s likely that Taylor Swift’s liberal politics won’t shift to the right, nor will the politics of most of her fans. But there’s always the chance that the femininity she projects will rouse their desire for a different kind of womanhood than the sterile ones society blasts at them from every corner.
