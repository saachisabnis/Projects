Cam’ron has no doubts about Taylor Swift’s immense popularity, going so far as to say she now outshines Kanye West.
During an episode of It Is What It Is that aired on Tuesday (February 13), the show’s co-hosts discussed the now-disputed rumor that Ye was kicked out of the Super Bowl due to his proximity to Taylor Swift.

“Tried to diss that young lady years ago and she ain’t forget about it,” Cam said, referring to the infamous incident from the 2009 VMAs. “She don’t want to be seen with you, let alone the Super Bowl screen […] That man got up there, embarrassed Taylor Swift at them awards, tried to go Beyoncé crazy.
“Taylor Swift, since that moment, became a[n] astronomical superstar — awards on top of awards, record sales on top of record sales — and now, to me at this particular point, Taylor Swift is a bigger star than Kanye.”

He added: “There’s a reason the NFL is showing her 17 times a game, each and every week. That’s just my opinion. I believe with all this stuff going on with Kanye now, his celebrity kind of died down. Kanye just put a[n] album out last week, I didn’t even know.”

Last year, the Dipset MC weighed in on Ye’s off-the-wall antics, suggesting that they’re calculated.
The sports media personality sat down for an interview with All The Smoke co-hosts Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson in December, where he was asked to share the first thoughts that came to mind when he heard the name “Kanye West.”

“Kanye, he play crazy with who he wanna play crazy with, you know what I’m saying? That n-gga’s crazy when it’s convenient,” he said, prompting laughs from the former NBA duo, with Jackson saying he “agrees wholeheartedly.”
Cam furthered his argument by saying that he himself has never encountered the side of the Yeezy mogul’s personality that often stirs up controversy.

“I seen Kanye about a year and a half, two years ago… the n-gga was sane as a muthafucka!” he added, before recalling that the Chicago native asked him if he wanted beats.
“Two days later, he going crazy on the news and all type of shit. Every time I seen Kanye he’s perfectly fine — I’ve never seen the crazy Kanye, personally. Ever.”
