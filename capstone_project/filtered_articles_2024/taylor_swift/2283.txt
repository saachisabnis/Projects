	The black-and-white cover art featured a photo of Swift holding her head in an upward position, while the back includes another fierce snapshot along with the quote, “Old habits die screaming.” The fourth variant of The Tortured Poets Department is scheduled for release on April 19.

	“‘Old habits die screaming…’ File Name: The Black Dog 🖤 Pre-order the final new edition of THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT with exclusive bonus track ‘The Black Dog’ on my website now,” Swift wrote on Instagram alongside photos of the cover art.

	Fans will be able to order “The Black Dog” edition on the singer-songwriter’s webstore through March 6.

	Swift has already announced three variants of the album, each featuring a different bonus track: “The Manuscript,” “The Bolter” and “The Albatross.” She revealed “The Bolter” and “The Albatross” editions at previous tour dates in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Fans guessed another announcement might have been made at the first Singapore concert of the tour.

	The “Anti-Hero” singer first announced The Tortured Poets Department while accepting the best pop vocal award for Midnights at the 2024 Grammys on Feb. 4. Shortly afterward, she dropped the project’s tracklist, which features 16 core songs and collaborations from Florence + The Machine and Post Malone.
