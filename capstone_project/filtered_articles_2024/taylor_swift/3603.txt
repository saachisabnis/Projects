Travis Kelce is out here promoting something called the Kelce Jam (aka his music festival!!!), which means he's blessing everyone with a buncha interviews. And as much as we all want to know more about the Kelce Jam, we're obviously here for the Taylor Swift content—and Travis didn't hold back!
Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.
Alexa, play “...Ready for It?”
Correction: screaming!
In response to Entertainment Tonight straight-up asking, “Is it the Bahamian sun or the Bahamian love that has you just glowing right now,” Travis said, “You know what? It’s just the lovely place down there, isn’t it? You can get it all down there. All the love in the world.”
Coy! But cute!
Meanwhile, Travis told the outlet that Taylor has hugely influenced his taste in music. Ahem: “It's definitely been fun to experience her taste in music, for sure. She's so amazing at what she does. And to find that creativity to see where she likes to pull things from and just, really, how she listens to music is very eye-opening for me. It's been fun to hear her take on it.”
“I'll tell you what, I'm a real music lover and it goes all over the place, especially when it comes to a game day playlist because I go all over,” he added. “Things from my childhood. My high school pep band used to play 'SpottieOttieDopaliscious' from Outkast. On top of that, Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz back in the day had a song called 'Duffle Bag Boy' and I loved that. I play everything, from the old school jock jams from being a little kid. It goes all over the place. It's definitely a variety of music. I just can't pick one thing.”
And when it comes to Taylor Swift's tracks? “That's my everyday playlist,” he gushed. “Not just my game day.”
My heart? Just casually melting out here, NBD!
The Tortured Poets Department drops April 19!
"I've never had an album where I needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets."
Okay, this kiiiiinda disputes breakup album theories.
Interesting timing!!!!!
Joe Alwyn found shaking.
Once you see these side-by-sides, you will not be the same.
"From 'london boy' to 'so long london'..."
Joe Alwyn has everything to do with April 19.
It has to do with a group chat Joe has... 👀
