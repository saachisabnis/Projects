Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour opened in October with more than $92.8 million in grosses, instantly becoming the top-grossing concert film in history after just one weekend. The Eras Tour film was shot over the course of Swift’s first three shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., where she performed six shows in early August. The film was directed by Sam Wrench, who received a Grammy nomination late last year for directing Billie Eilish Live at the O2, which was a contender for best music film.

	Swift then unveiled an on-demand The Eras Tour extended edition film, which included performances of “The Archer,” “Long Live” and “Wildest Dreams.” The version was available on Prime Video, Apple TV+, Xfinity, Vudu, Google Play, YouTubeTV and SkyTV Premiere.
