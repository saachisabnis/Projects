#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
My fellow Swifties, if you have not been able to attend a Taylor Swift concert recently for one reason or another, a new type of show is coming to Evansville, Indiana that you're going to be excited about.
Tribute bands have been growing in popularity in the past few years. Many times, it's because that particular artist is no longer with us or the band is not together anymore. These tribute shows are really just a fun way to gather with fellow fans, and have a great time.
This isn't your average concert, folks. It's a full-on Taylor Swift experience, complete with a killer tribute band that'll have you belting out all your favorite hits. We're talking "Love Story," "You Belong With Me," "Shake It Off" – all the classics!
