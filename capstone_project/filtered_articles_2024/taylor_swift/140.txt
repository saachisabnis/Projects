Taylor Swift fans from all over Southern California celebrated the beloved megastar at Garden Amp in Garden Grove during a special tribute evening on Saturday, Jan. 6.
The crowd sang and danced along to Swift’s hits courtesy of tribute act Taylor Nation, including tracks several from her ongoing The Eras Tour, a cultural phenomenon so intriguing it has inspired full college courses to study it and publications have hired dedicated staff to cover Swift’s every move.
Daniel Park, promoter and talent buyer at Garden Amp, said in a previous interview that the event was booked more specifically for the Southern California Swifties that weren’t able to get a hold of or afford the tickets for Swift’s The Eras Tour when it hit SoFi Stadium in Inglewood for six sold-out evenings back in August.
Though Swift also released the “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film in theaters back in October and it was made available on demand in December, those experiences didn’t include the live concert element that created the special moments and bonds between strangers that suddenly became friends by swapping friendship bracelets and singing loudly to each and every song.
