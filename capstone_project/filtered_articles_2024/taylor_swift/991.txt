She’s dominated the music industry for years – and now Taylor Swift is making waves in the sports world, too.
The pop superstar made a surprise appearance at an NFL game in September to cheer on her boyfriend Travis Kelce for the first time when his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, took on the Chicago Bears.
Since then, the 34-year-old has been seen in the crowd at several Chiefs games – often dressed in the team’s colours of red and white alongside Kelce’s family.
The so-called ‘Taylor Swift effect’ has led to inflated viewing numbers for the NFL, and brought in a new female audience.
After Kelce and the Chiefs secured a place at the Super Bowl with a win over Baltimore, Swift celebrated the victory by kissing him on the field – and she now faces a mad dash to get back from her Eras World Tour show in Tokyo to be there for the Championship game.
Swift’s first appearance at a Chiefs game against the Bears in September was watched by 27 million people – making it the most-watched Sunday show since Super Bowl LVII in February.
Her presence has drawn in a new female audience to the game, with female viewership rocketing by 37%.
The number of girls aged 12 to 17 watching NFL games has increased by 53%, leading some dads to joke that Swift has brought them closer to their young daughters.
One father said on X: ‘My 12-year-old daughter just asked me to point out Jason Kelce & it spurred an entire conversation about why lineman have the numbers they do. I love her beyond words, but the kid never cares about football. That was cool.’
Another dad wrote: ‘The Taylor Swift effect: My seven year old daughter is demanding we watch the KC/Miami game.’
It looks like the phenomenon isn’t stopping any time soon. 23 million people tuned in to watch the Chiefs-Dolphins game last weekend – a record number for a playoff game since 2016.
And it’s not just viewing figures that Swift is having an impact on.
At a September Chief-Jets game, interest in tickets on StubHub rocketed by 175%, making it the second-highest selling game of the season. The match was watched by more than 24 million.
The singer’s presence at the games has boosted the NFL’s brand value by $122 million through the increase in interest, according to MarketWatch data.
Swift told Time that she wasn’t always aware that she was being filmed during the games.
‘​​There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once,’ she said. ‘I’m just there to support Travis’.
Some NFL fans have been disgruntled by Swift’s appearances at games.
Buffalo Bills fans booed the singer when she arrived at the Chiefs-Bills playoff game on Sunday. In response, Swift blew a kiss at the booing crowds.

Former NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy said that Taylor Swift is ‘disenchanting people with sports’.
‘There’s so much on the outside coming in entertainment value and different things taking away from what really happens on the field,’ he told Fox News.
At the Golden Globes, host Jo Koy joked about the amount of airtime Swift got during NFL games.
‘​​The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift. I swear, there’s just more to go to,’ Koy said.
Other fans have even said they want the Chiefs to be knocked out of the league because they think Swift is distracting from the game.
‘There’s a side of America that wants the Ravens to beat the Chiefs strictly because they are tired of seeing Taylor Swift every 5 mins during the game,’ one social media pundit wrote.
The @Ravens are Americaâs Team right now. They are the last line of defense in preventing Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce storyline from infecting the #SuperBowl. Go #Ravens!
‘Baltimore has to beat the Chiefs. I can’t handle Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce coverage for two weeks at the Super Bowl,’ another wrote.
Most fans, though, ignored the backlash. ‘Nobody’s asking if Travis Kelce is distracting her [Swift] from a world tour,’ ESPN sports anchor Elle Duncan said on her podcast at the end of last year. And the exposure she is bringing speaks for itself.
Even Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, isn’t immune from the ‘Taylor Swift effect’.
There’s been a 400% boost to his No. 87 jersey sales, and his social media following has exploded.
Kelce’s Instagram following ballooned to 3.5 million following Swift’s appearance at the Chiefs-Bears game in September.
He also gained 570,000 followers on TikTok and 25,000 on X.
