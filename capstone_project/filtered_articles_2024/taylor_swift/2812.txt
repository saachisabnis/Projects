Former Rep. George Santos made a joke at the expense of Taylor Swift on Saturday, predicting she will endorse President Joe Biden.
“I see @taylorswift13 endorsing @JoeBiden for president,” Santos wrote. “I mean I see how this makes sense since 95% of her songs are about choosing the wrong guy. I guess we can all expect a Taylor Swift revenge song on Biden in 2025…”

In 2020, Swift endorsed Biden over then-President Donald Trump. The pop star has yet to endorse anyone ahead of the 2024 race.
Swift is known for her political activism. Last year, she encouraged her followers on her Instagram story to register to vote, which resulted in 35,252 registrations on the site, in addition to over 150,000 visits to the site. Notably, 18-year-old first-time voters registered by an increase of 115% from the previous year.

Santos, notably, hasn’t issued an endorsement of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, ahead of the 2024 election. Previously, Santos served as president of United for Trump, a New York-based campaign for Trump’s reelection in 2020.
Despite being expelled from Congress last year, Santos has filed for reelection in New York’s 1st Congressional District, with plans to primary Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY). Santos is lacking endorsements in his second campaign. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY) has already replaced him in New York’s 3rd District.
