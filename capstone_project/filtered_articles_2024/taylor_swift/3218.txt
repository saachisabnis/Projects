Beyoncé’s new album Cowboy Carter is out now, and while it’s the latest execution of her beloved vision, she didn’t make the project all by herself: Shaboozey, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Linda Martell, and others make appearances on the album. The way some hear it, though, it sounds like Taylor Swift is involved, too.
Some reports have indicated Swift is credited on the song “Bodyguard,” citing supposed credits on both Spotify and Genius. As of this post, though, Swift does not appear to be officially credited on those platforms or others. That said, while Swift may not be credited, there’s one snippet of the song that fans point to, a brief portion that to them clearly indicates Swift sang backing vocals for the track.
Give it a listen:

Worth noting is that back in February, “a source with knowledge of the situation” told Entertainment Weekly that despite rumors, Swift is not featured on the album “in any way.” Of course, the source could have been denying the rumor to keep the truth a secret, Swift could have gotten on board with the album since then, or the source could have just been wrong.
Either way, listen to “Bodyguard” above.
