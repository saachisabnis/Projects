Pop sensation Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce found themselves in the crosshairs of animal rights organization PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) following their recent visit to Sydney Zoo during Swift’s “Eras Tour” in Australia. The couple’s decision to tour the zoo instead of opting for a ‘true sanctuary’ sparked criticism from PETA‘s Director of Captive Animal Welfare, Debbie Metzler.Source: Sky News Australia/YouTubeIn a statement, Metzler expressed PETA‘s disappointment, suggesting that Swift and Kelce should have chosen a sanctuary instead of a zoo to experience Australia’s wildlife. The controversy didn’t end with the zoo visit; Swift and Kelce faced additional scrutiny for feeding a young kangaroo during their tour. PETA highlighted the distinction between zoos and sanctuaries, emphasizing that sanctuaries prioritize the well-being of animals by prohibiting visitor interactions like feeding or touching.This isn’t the first time PETA has called out NFL figures for animal-related controversies. Previously, the organization targeted Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, for sharing images of herself swimming with dolphins.Celebrities should be held accountable when setting an example for animal welfare. Zoos do not always treat their animals how they should be treated. By attending a sanctuary instead, Taylor and Travis could meet some amazing animals while also supporting an organized effort for animal welfare.Tiny Rescue Animal CollectionEmpty The Cages Tee By Tiny Rescue: Animal CollectionBeing publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high-quality content.Click here to Support UsRelated Content:
