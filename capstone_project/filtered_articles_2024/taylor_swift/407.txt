Taylor Swift never leaves the Billboard 200, as fans across the U.S. never stop consuming her albums. Not only is she present at all times on the ranking of the most popular albums in the U.S., but more often than not, she owns the most real estate on the tally. This frame, Swift not only occupies more spaces than any other artist, but she matches a historic feat that only she’s managed.
On this week’s Billboard 200, Swift fills 10 spaces on the 200-spot chart. Impressively, all of those hit albums appear in the upper half of the ranking.
Swift remains the only living artist to claim 10 spaces inside the top 100 on the Billboard 200. She first managed this feat in May 2023. Now, she’s replicated the showing, as only she can.
The singer’s dominance is evident at first glance at the Billboard 200, as Swift sits at No. 1 yet again. Her 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is steady in first place on the tally for a sixth nonconsecutive frame. The title is the most successful in her re-release series, and it has now led the charge in both 2023 and 2024.
Swift claims three more top 10 titles this week, giving her control over 40% of the highest tier on the Billboard 200. Midnights rises to No. 5, Lover ascends to No. 6, and Folklore is back inside the uppermost region on the chart, settling at No. 10.
Between Nos. 11 and 20, Swift fills yet another three spaces. Evermore, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), and Reputation all climb significantly from where they ranked last time around. Those sets currently appear at Nos. 16, 17, and 19, respectively.
As for Swift’s three other top 100-charting albums, they aren’t far away from her higher-reaching wins. Red (Taylor's Version) lands at No. 21, Fearless (Taylor's Version) improves to No. 39, and 1989 (the original) sits at No. 59.
Nearly all of Swift’s charting titles on this week’s Billboard 200 improve significantly from where they ranked last frame. This period marks the first in more than a month that the ranking isn’t filled with Christmas projects. As those efforts fall away following the end of the holiday season, dozens of albums return to the chart, while plenty of others climb on the freer tally.
