OutKick on Tuesday welcomed author Nick Adams into its fold, possibly confirming one of the most absurd voices in political media might actually mean some of the things he says.
In his debut column on the platform founded by Clay Travis, Adams played some of his greatest hits: women need an alpha male, he is the alpha male that women need, and anyone saying otherwise is simply spouting ‚Äúwoke nonsense.‚Äù
He described this first piece as his way of establishing ‚Äúsome cold, hard facts.‚Äù
MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT:
I am taking my talents to @Outkick and joining the team as a columnist. In my first piece, I establish some cold, hard facts.
Women don‚Äôt want soft men. Women want alpha males like Nick Adams!https://t.co/bTTDCbU9xM

A source clarified that Adams is a guest columnist at Outkick, not an employee.
Adams, originally from Sydney, Australia, got his big break in 2017 when then-President Donald Trump praised him for his book Green Card Warrior ‚Äî in which Adams details his arduous journey acquiring said green card. He believes immigration officials conspired against him because of his conservative views.
Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends

With his profile elevated by Trump‚Äôs endorsement, Adams has become a caricature of conservative commentary. He frequently boasts about being an alpha male and has a strange obsession with bashing pop stars Taylor Swift and Harry Styles to prop up Kid Rock.
Raise your children to be like Kid Rock and Kyle Rittenhouse, NOT Taylor Swift and Harry Styles!

Unlike Taylor Swift and Harry Styles, Kid Rock is one of the greatest musicians on planet earth.
‚Äî Nick Adams (Alpha Male) (@NickAdamsinUSA) March 22, 2022
Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, and Gene Simmons are each a million times MORE talented musicians than Harry Styles or Taylor Swift could ever DREAM of being!

Alpha males listen to Jason Aldean and Kid Rock, NOT Taylor Swift and Harry Styles.

He‚Äôs also at war with tapas, the Spanish dish he deems too ‚Äúbeta‚Äù for his liking.
Alpha males eat wings and drink beer at Hooters with the boys, Beta males nibble on tapas at Spanish Vegan cafes with their wives.

His current pinned tweet is some bizarre video that shows him walking up to a convertible car full of women with beer in hand. After some driving, it‚Äôs revealed they‚Äôre actually in one of those amphibious cars that lets him drive into the water where it becomes a boat. Then, the women begin reading his new book Alpha Kings while he joyfully cruises around. They end up on a yacht to party and continue reading the book.
An average day in the life of an alpha male.

His commentary has become so ridiculous that most assume it‚Äôs nothing more than an act. Others aren‚Äôt even sure if Adams exists.
Enough with the dunks, that Nick Adams guy is obviously doing a bit

Hold up. Nick Adams is a real person? https://t.co/HDdI53IpZc

While it‚Äôs been easy to brush it off as an over-the-top gimmick, Adams joining OutKick ‚Äî an outlet that takes itself seriously for the most part ‚Äî changes things. Does he actually view himself as some ideal specimen of masculinity? Does he actually despise Taylor Swift and delicious tapas as much as his hundreds of tweets about them would dictate?
Despite him doing multiple public appearances and TV spots, even I still have to ask: Is this actually a real person?
