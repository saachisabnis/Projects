We’re so back, Swifties.
Starting in February, Time Magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year and Kansas City Chiefs superfan Taylor Swift is resuming her international ‘Eras Tour’ that will send her and special guests Sabrina Carpenter, Paramore and Gracie Abrams all over the world in 2024.
This time around, she’ll be hitting Asia, Europe, the U.S. and Canada.
And while prices remain characteristically high, a select few concerts have seats going for under $500 before fees on Vivid Seats.

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely.
Over the past few months, we’ve a) spoken to a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, b) came up with a list of all the most exciting fan trends and c) explained the drama surrounding her international opener Sabrina Carpenter.
Want to see how much it cost to see Taylor in the states at the outset of the ‘Eras Tour?’ You can find that information right here.
When Taylor travels internationally, she’s only bringing two opening acts along for the ride.
Here’s what you need to know about her well-established special guests.
Sabrina Carpenter, 24, isn’t just a singer. Over the past decade, she’s also starred in the Disney Channel’s “Girl Meets World” and the feature film “The Hate U Give.” if you’re more interested in her music, we recommend you check out her biggest singles “On My Way,” “Nonsense” and “Thumbs.”
Paramore will play alongside Swift after mounting a massive 2023 arena tour of their own. The group, fronted by lead singer Hayley Williams, reunited in 2022 after a five-year hiatus. For fans that want to check out their latest, you can listen to “This Is Why,” their sixth studio album, which dropped in February 2023.
Gracie Abrams, the daughter of film director JJ Abrams and producer Katie McGrath, is a star in her own right. Her song “I miss you, I’m sorry” has upwards of 100 million streams on Spotify, she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the 2022 “Sour Tour” and headlined her own tour last spring as well.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (maybe more!) to see Swift live this year, there are much more affordable concerts you can attend this year.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Adele
• Olivia Rodrigo
• Pink
• Christina Aguilera
• Alanis Morissette
