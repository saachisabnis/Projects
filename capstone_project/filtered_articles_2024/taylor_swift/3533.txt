Bruno Mars has been announced as the first-ever performer for the IntuitDome, a new Los Angeles arena that will serve as the home of the Clippers.
In a press release, it was revealed that the Silk Sonic crooner will break his six-year performing hiatus in L.A. to appear at the Intuit Dome, located in Inglewood, CA, this summer.

The back-to-back dates are August 15th and August 16th, and tickets will go on sale on April 11.
“We are thrilled Bruno Mars will open Intuit Dome,” said Gillian Zucker, CEO, Halo Sports and Entertainment, in a statement. “Bruno, who has a strong connection to Inglewood, will undoubtedly deliver an iconic performance that is worthy of this moment, and will leave a lasting impression on everyone who attends these two shows.”

Mars said in a video tied to the shows: “I moved to Inglewood, California when I was eighteen years old, in hopes one day I could write a song. A song that would allow me to perform all over the world. Opening up this arena is a full-circle moment, and I can’t wait to celebrate.”
Back in February, the “Uptown Funk” singer celebrated the grand opening of his Las Vegas lounge The Pinky Ring with a star-studded party during Super Bowl weekend.
Going down on February 10, just two days ahead of the spot’s official opening to the public, Bruno partied with the likes of Janelle Monáe, Lady Gaga, Victoria Monét, Babyface, T-Pain, Karrueche Tran, Lucky Daye and more at the venue located inside Bellagio Resort & Casino.

The famed singer also hit the stage with his group The Hooligans for a live performance, and the band continued performing nightly for the first two weeks of the opening.
Per a press release, “guests will enjoy Bruno’s homage to the entertainers who helped shape Las Vegas and immerse themselves in his vision of timeless glamour and remarkable artistry. Every element of the experience — from the specialty bar program and live entertainment — has been curated by the global superstar as a place for people to get lost in a good time they will remember forever.”

Nick Cannon recently gave Bruno Mars his props as one of his favorite performers – though he caught the ire of Beyoncé fans in the process because he argued that Bruno had more hits than her.

The Wild ‘N Out host made the controversial statement during an episode of his Daily Cannon radio show on Amazon’s Amp last spring, with the debate being sparked by Cannon praising Mars’ live performances.
“Have you ever seen Bruno perform live?” he asked his co-hosts. “Fire! ‘Cause he got his whole crew on stage with him and they be doing the little dances. It feels very Morris Day and the Time-ish.”

“I could probably afford those tickets,” Mason Moussette replied, before bringing up the sky-high prices for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift’s respective tours.
“See, no offense, but I would rather go to a Bruno Mars show than a Beyoncé or a Taylor Swift [show],” Cannon then declared, which was met with bemusement from his colleagues.
