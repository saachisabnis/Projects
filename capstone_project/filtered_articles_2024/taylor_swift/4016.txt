Ye is jumping in to the ongoing melee by firing his own shots on his version of Future & Metro Boomin's "Like That." On Saturday, April 20, the artist formerly known as Kanye West debuted his "Like That" (Remix) on Justin Laboy's "The Download." Ye put his own "hooligan" touch to their top-charting record by switching up the beat. He also replaced Kendrick Lamar's infamous verse with his own insulting bars about Drake and J. Cole. "Y'all so outta sight, outta mind, I can't even think of a Drake line," Ye raps. "Play J. Cole, get the p*ssy dry/Play this s**t back a hundred-thirty times." 
The song comes less than 24 hours after Drake dropped off his second diss track aimed at Lamar. On the track, Drizzy cooked up AI-generated verses from the late Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg to taunt the Compton rapper into dropping a response. He also accused Kdot of delaying his response due to the release of Taylor Swift's new album. "The first one really only took me an hour or two/The next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you," Drake raps. "But now we gotta wait a f**kin' week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new Top/And if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve/This girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud/She tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop." So far, neither Drake nor J. Cole have responded to Ye. Watch Ye debut the song below.
