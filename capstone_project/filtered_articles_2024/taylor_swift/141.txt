Taylor Swift is all everybody's talking about lately. The talented pop star's love life, career, and fashion choices are all trending topics of conversation - being discussed, shared, and reposted by millions of people across the globe.
Colorado State University recently entered the Taylor Swift chat, citing an interesting connection between the famous singer and the college in Fort Collins.
During the December 17 Chiefs vs. Patriots game, Swift was seen cheering on her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, while wearing a red, gray, and black plaid mini-skirt paired with a vintage Chiefs sweatshirt. Per usual Taylor's spirited outfit received immediate attention for being stylish, but especially caught the eye of Swifties in Fort Collins.
The now-famous pleated skirt was designed by Rails, where CSU alum Linney Warren, is the Vice President of Women’s Design. Warren graduated from Colorado State University in 2009 with a Bachelor's Degree in Health and Human Sciences, focusing on Apparel and Merchandising; Apparel Design and Production. It's safe to say this former Ram has gone places in her career since leaving CSU!
In People Magazine, Warren explained the '90s-style skirt was designed to be a garment that Swift could seamlessly blend into her existing wardrobe. The superstar is reportedly a fan of the brand and has been sporting pieces of clothing from the line for 15 years.
Swift's exact skirt was custom-made and isn't available for sale, however, Rails does offer something similar for those trying to replicate Swift's style.
Thanks to a talented CSU alum, Taylor Swift will never go out of style!
