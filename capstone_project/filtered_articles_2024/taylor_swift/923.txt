AI-generated images showing Taylor Swift in explicit sexual poses circulated on social media Thursday, prompting her fans, known as Swifties, to leap to her defense.
Since Thursday morning, “Taylor Swift AI” has been trending on Twitter with more than 58,000 posts, the New York Post reports.
The images, called “deepfakes,” depict Swift naked with Kansas City Chiefs players, an allusion to her relationship with the team’s tight end, Travis Kelce.
In October, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to regulate the use of AI and prevent the production of child pornography and “non-consensual intimate imagery,” according to New York Post. Several states have outlawed non-consensual AI-generated images, but a federal law to do the same is still making its way through Congress (RELATED: Here Are A Handful Of Incredibly Realistic Deepfake Videos Of Zuckerberg And Chris Christie)
Now, Swifties are rallying to protect their idol, flooding social media with positive Taylor-related posts to drown out the porn while also demanding that lawmakers step in to stop explicit non-consensual deepfakes.
One user asked how there could be “no regulations [or] laws preventing this.”
Another noted that the “‘silver lining’ about it happening to taylor swift, is she likely has enough power to get legislation passed to eliminate it.”
“those taylor ai pics are straight up sexual harassment and it’s disgusting that man can do those things without repercussions. they see women as objects made for their sick fantasies and i’m so sick of it. it makes me want to throw up PROTECT TAYLOR SWIFT,” another user posted.

“‘taylor swift is a billionaire she’ll be fine’ THAT DOESN’T MEAN U CAN GO AROUND POSTING SEXUAL AI PICS OF HER LIKE A FREAK SHE’S STILL HUMAN BEING WITH FEELINGS,” another wrote.
Swift’s publicist has not issued statements regarding the images, the New York Post reported.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
