(SOUNDBITE OF TAYLOR SWIFT SONG, "SHAKE IT OFF")
A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:
Good morning. I'm A Martínez. Last year, Taylor Swift was seen everywhere, from movie theaters to Kansas City Chiefs football games, and now it sounds like she was heard everywhere, too. The pop queen accounted for nearly 2% of all songs streamed in the U.S. last year - about 1 in every 78. Swift's dominance happened during a record year for global streaming. Audio streams increased by a third in 2023, crossing the 4 trillion mark for the first time. And yet, Taylor just shook off the competition. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.
