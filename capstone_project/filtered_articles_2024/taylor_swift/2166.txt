On the Town: Art With a Heart celebrates resiliency
By : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//March 1, 2024//  
The Tri Delta Alumnae Chapter of Oklahoma City recently celebrated the resilience and creativity of children who are current or past patients of the Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders while raising funds for local organizations.
Each year, the fun Tri Delts’ Art With a Heart event keeps its focus on these patients, their stories, their families and their colorful artwork, which sold for high amounts throughout the evening, held in downtown Oklahoma City at Leadership Square. Proceeds from this year’s auction – and related sales of art reproductions on other items – benefited the Oklahoma Children’s Cancer Association, Cavett Kids Foundation and the K Club (Keaton’s Kindness Foundation).
Art With a Heart artists arrived by limo that evening to be greeted by University of Oklahoma football players, who escorted them inside along a red carpet lined with cheering players, the artists’ parents and paparazzi-like fans and others as announcers celebrated them one by one. 



After the presentation, I enjoyed visiting with many of them at the tables where guests were bidding on their paintings. Sonja Sebastian, 5, who is in post-treatment from a liver tumor, painted a great picture of a black cat that looks like my own. Bo McDonald, a Norman North High School senior, a colon cancer survivor, worked with Hadly McIntyre to create a moody and beautiful sunset painting. And it was fun to visit with a fellow Taylor Swift fan – Audra Yarholar, 13, who loves basketball and golf and was taking part in her fifth Art With a Heart event.
Event chairmen were Jordan Fritz, Calli Henderson, Hannah Hunt and Claire Atkinson. Key (“Degas”) sponsors were Candid Color Systems, MidFirst Bank, Framed in the Village, HBC Champions Foundation and friends and family of Daylinn Rae Kimbro. Volunteers included collegiate Tri Delts attending area universities at OU and Oklahoma State University.
