X has blocked Taylor Swift searches temporarily following concerns about explicit deep fake images spreading across the site.
At the time of writing, if you search “Taylor Swift,” a message reading “posts aren’t loading right now” will appear.
And Elon Musk‘s microblogging app — formerly known as  Twitter — has explained that they have done so due to “safety” concerns arising from the graphic images, seemingly created by AI, of the “Anti-Hero” hitmaker being spread around.
“This is a temporary action and done with an abundance of caution as we prioritize safety on this issue,” X said in a statement.
The social media site had already warned against posting “nonconsensual nudity images,” as they work to take down content of this nature.
“Posting nonconsensual nudity images is strictly prohibited on X, and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,” it said in a statement last week.
“Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them. We’re closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed. We’re committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users,” it added.
