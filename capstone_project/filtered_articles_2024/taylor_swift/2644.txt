Here is what else is happening across the ‘net.
🚘 This Mercedes-Benz dealership worker went viral after sharing some harrowing advice about identity theft. 
🛒 Viewers are divided after watching a woman grocery shop for the week at Dollar Tree. “Dollar Tree steak is crazy,” a top comment read.
💼 Some people take the meaning of “remote” work to its absolute limits. Although the average employer would probably prefer if their employees were working from a desk or somewhere more stable, users on TikTok have admitted to clocking in from all sorts of wild destinations—often without their boss knowing.
🍔 The quality of a hamburger patty may soon see a U.S. school system in court after a parent’s concerns about food quality in their school system were allegedly brushed off as a simple preference.
☎️ One shopper took it upon himself to answer a ringing Walmart store phone and assist customers calling about online order issues and inventory questions. The reason? No workers were around to answer the phone. 
🍽️ A couple shared a hack to save money when out at restaurants, but TikTok viewers were left divided over whether it was an ethical hack.
🍸 This server says he refilled bottles of Patron, Don Julio, Hennessy, and Grey Goose to trick customers.

The Internet can be terrifying sometimes—but other times, it can be a magical place.
Case in point, the recent viral reemergence of these A+ ads that ran back in 2003 when Chilean TV first aired the original Star Wars films on cable.
According to several reports, these channels didn’t want to have to cut away for an ad break, but also still had to have the ads in there—so, their solution was to simply put the ads in the movies themselves. 
Specifically, ads for Cerveza Cristal beer.
This resulted in Luke receiving his father’s beer supply instead of a lightsaber. Oh, and Palpatine using the force to summon—you guessed it—a beer.
