Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is understandably taking every moment to celebrate his team's back-to-back Super Bowl wins in the offseason. He's partied in Vegas with teammates, continued his mega-popular podcast with big brother Jason and traveled the globe to see his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, perform her Eras Tour show.

Next up, Kelce is hosting Kelce Jam for the second straight year, a music festival that the three-time Super Bowl winner will once again throw in Kansas City. Kelce told The Hollywood Reporter about the event and even shared what lessons he learned from watching Swift perform more this year.
"Don’t try and be Taylor, that’s what I learned," Kelce said in the interview. "Yeah, she’s on a whole other stratosphere. She’s the best at what she does for a reason. It’s because she’s so articulate and just very dialed into every single thing that she does. And that’s the beauty of it. I’d be silly if I ever tried to take anything from what she does, other than just enjoy the people that show up."
Kelce Jam will take place May 18 and feature artists like Lil Wayne, Diplo and 2 Chainz.
