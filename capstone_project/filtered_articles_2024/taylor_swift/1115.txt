Well, it's officially official.
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49s are going to the big game in a few weeks. It's the most-watched TV moment in America year after year, and we couldn't be more excited.
Why? Because if the Chiefs are playing, that means we get more camera cutaway shots of Taylor Swift!
As you can see, we got a few really cute shots of Taylor and Travis Kelce at last night's AFC Championship Game. The question is, now that Travis and the Chiefs (and Taylor) are going to the Super Bowl, how many times are we going to see Taylor Swift on TV?
If you've actually been paying attention, you've probably seen Taylor on TV a few times during the last couple Chiefs games. Normally, they'll cut to her and friends and family in the stands for just a moment, then return back to the game. For most of her NFL appearances, that has added up to about :30 seconds of air time per game.
But will the Super Bowl be the same case?
We have to imagine with the Super Bowl being the biggest TV moment of the year, the people behind the broadcast are going to want to capitalize the millions and millions of eyeballs that'll be fixed to their TV screens. Does that mean showing more Taylor to appeal to her fans, or showing less so viewers can focus more on the big game?
Either way, we're voting Taylor Swift as the NFL MVP of the year.
The Super Bowl airs Sunday, February 11th, on CBS.
