On Friday (September 13), Nasty Nas re-shared Lamar’s Super Bowl announcement on his own Instagram Story, adding: “Congratulations to my brotha @kendricklamar. Can’t wait to watch the party die!!!!”

Nas was congratulating Lamar, of course, on the announcement that the West Coast rapper will be performing during the halftime show at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, news that was announced just last weekend.
On Sunday (September 8), the NFL announced that K. Dot has been confirmed to headline the Apple Music Halftime Show at next year’s championship game, which is set to take place on February 9 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.

“Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,” Lamar said as part of the formal announcement. “And I’ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.”
Alongside the organization’s statement, which they issued in partnership with Apple and JAY-Z‘s Roc Nation, the former TDE rapper shared a video clip on X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and YouTube — one Nas re-shared in his message.

In the clip, Kendrick is seen running a practice session with an unseen receiver off-screen. After launching a few passes, supported by guidance and praise for the player, he shares the big news and subtly references his beef with Drake earlier this summer.
“My name’s Kendrick Lamar and I’ll be performing at Super Bowl LIX,” he begins. “Will you be pulling up? I hope so! You know it’s only one opportunity to win a championship; no round twos. I wouldn’t want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans, February 9, 2025. Wear your best dressed too, even if you’re watching from home.”

The “no round twos” line seems to be a direct call back to a post which Drizzy made via his burner account exactly two weeks prior, amid his onslaught of new releases.
Seemingly indicating that he was gearing up for a second round of their battle, Drizzy shared a clip of former Detroit Pistons star Rasheed Wallace’s famous interview where he guaranteed that the team would triumph over the Indiana Pacers in game two of the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals.

“Y’all can put it on the front page, back page, middle page, wherever, headliners, column one or two — we will win game two,” the four-time NBA All-Star confidently says in the video following the Pistons’ game one defeat.
Sheed’s prediction came true as the Pistons defeated the Pacers on their way to winning the series 4-2.
