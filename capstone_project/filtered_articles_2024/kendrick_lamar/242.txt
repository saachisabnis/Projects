Kendrick Lamar sparked controversy on his latest album, GNX, with the opening track “Wacced Out Murals.” In the song, he called out a “white comedian” for making offensive jokes about Black women, leading fans to speculate he was addressing comedian Andrew Schulz. Known for podcasts like FLAGRANT and The Brilliant Idiots, Schulz has faced criticism for remarks deemed disrespectful toward Black women.

Schulz didn’t shy away from responding, using sarcasm to dismiss Kendrick’s critique. On FLAGRANT, Schulz mocked hip-hop’s history of misogyny, claiming, “No one has respected women more through art than rappers.” He pointed out the contradictions in Kendrick’s own career, such as collaborating with controversial artists like Kodak Black and nearly pulling his music off Spotify in defense of R. Kelly during the platform’s crackdown on “hateful content.” Schulz argued this undermines Kendrick’s stance on protecting Black women.

The debate raises questions about Kendrick’s position. While his advocacy for Black women is evident in his work, critics argue that working with problematic figures in hip-hop could be seen as hypocritical. Hip-hop, as Schulz highlighted, has its own history of misogyny, making Kendrick’s critique of Schulz potentially contradictory.
Schulz’s sarcastic remarks about Kendrick, which turned disturbingly personal, reignited criticism of his behavior. However, Kendrick’s silence on the matter leaves the conversation open, forcing fans to question whether his callout reflects genuine advocacy or selective outrage within a culture that still grapples with misogyny.
