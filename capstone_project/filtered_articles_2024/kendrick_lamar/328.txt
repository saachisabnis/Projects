“So many people kept calling and texting me with excitement of my name being used and for me it kinda just felt like… I really didn’t want anything to do with it,” he confessed.
“I got a ton of respect for both of these guys. Honestly, it was a cool thing to watch. I learned so much. It was an honor and blessing to be able to experience it firsthand.”
Yachty also revealed that he had prior knowledge about Kendrick namedropping him: “I knew that my name was mentioned before it came out. I didn’t hear the record but I had got word that I was mentioned. I wasn’t surprised.”

Lil Boat, who has worked extensively with Drake in recent years, also offered his thoughts on the high-profile feud, which has been crowned by many as Hip Hop’s greatest ever battle.
“Kendrick clearly had a lot more animosity, and you felt in every song that he dropped,” he said. “Drake dropped great records. But also, let’s be fair: Drake was deemed a loser in this battle before it started because people don’t like him and haven’t.

“Because he’s won for a very long time and he’s sat on the throne — respectfully, he still sits on the throne. Even if the opinionated masses say that Kendrick won, I don’t think people are gonna stop listening to Drake and Drake’s career is gonna flush.”
He added: “I told Drake, ‘I don’t feel like you won or lost.’ Rappers have lost, and then lost everything. But this hasn’t happened to Drake. He will still be in everybody’s Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year and he’ll still drop hits and control the summer. I think Kendrick made very smart moves and I don’t think Drake would disagree.”
