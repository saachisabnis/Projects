It’s the rap feud that has everyone talking right now. After the surprise drop of “Euphoria” on April 30, Kendrick Lamar’s “6:16 In LA” lyrics are a direct, blistering attack on Drake and it seems things are really heating up between the two. 
In the world of hip-hop, friendly competition, and the occasional back-and-forth banter in lyrics are not uncommon, but things between Drake and the Pulitzer-winning Kendrick have been boiling over as of late. 
On April 19, 2024, Drake released “Push Ups” as his response to Kendrick Lamar’s verse on Metro Boomin and Future’s “Like That.” The verse was a jab at J. Cole’s “First Person Shooter,” in which he referred to himself, Drake, and Kendrick as “the big three.” Drake fired at Kendrick again with “Taylor Made Freestyle”. 
On April 30, Kendrick issued a rebuttal with “Euphoria”; a striking 6-minute takedown of Drake: “A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now / You’rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted.”
Kendrick lobbed another music grenade at Drake on May 3, 2024. Kendrick Lamar’s “6:16 in LA” lyrics are scathing attacks on the Canadian-born rapper. The song title seems to reference a song format Drake is known for popularizing, including “6PM in New York” from If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late to “8am in Charlotte” from his recent album, For All the Dogs.
