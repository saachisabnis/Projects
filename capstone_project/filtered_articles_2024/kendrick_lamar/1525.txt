DeMar DeRozan is letting it be known he has no beef with Drake. DeRozan was on stage at Kendrick Lamar’s “The Pop Out” and also in the “Not Like Us” video, prompting questions about whether all was well after years playing for the Toronto Raptors.
Appearing on local Sacramento TV after joining the hometown Kings, DeRozan says Lamar is “family,” but Drake remains a friend.
“We love Drake, we always can play him,” said DeRozan. “Kendrick been a friend of mine, family. Damn near family, for a long time, for a while. We’re from the same city, we grew up damn near in the same neighborhood. It’s always been there. It hasn’t always been publicized, but, you know, that’s basically family.”
