Tension between Kendrick Lamar and Drake‘s camps has escalated after Top5 issued a menacing threat to K. Dot and his crew.
The recently freed Toronto rapper, who just earlier this week beat a murder case after evidence was dismissed by a judge, appeared on a stream with Adin Ross and Akademiks following his release.

During the broadcast, Top5 threatened both Kendrick and fellow Drake rival Metro Boomin by saying: “I’m looking for Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar. I’m doing my homework right now, I’m doing my task on them. Nothing incriminating, I’m just looking for them.
“I want Metro Boomin one on one. I don’t want no weapons, nothing. I’d knock him the fuck out. Kendrick Lamar, you passed the border. Chubbs called me.”
He added: “I will quit rapping if Kendrick Lamar goes to [the Toronto restaurant] New Ho King without 20 police officers […] You’re crazy for testing my gangsta. You see what happened to DJ Drama?”

Top5 also said he and Drake were planning to link up and do their “homework” on every one of Kendrick’s friends who appear in his “Not Like Us” video.
“Me and Drake are gonna link up in a couple of days and we’re gonna do this podcast, and we’re gonna play the ‘Not Like Us’ video and we’re gonna look at every n-gga in the video and we’re gonna do homework,” he warned.

“We’re gonna look for them n-ggas. I don’t fuck around, play around ’bout Aubrey, that’s my bro. My Jewish brother, shalom.”
Top5 soon got a response from Kendrick’s longtime friend and fellow rappper Hitta J3, who appears on the cover of To Pimp a Butterfly.
“Come find out then,” he hit back on X (formerly Twitter), before posting a video of the Canadian rapper getting punked in his hometown of Toronto.

Another Kendrick and TDE affiliate Smac also responded to Top5, saying on the FMW podcast: “Fuck you and Toronto, Top5. You ain’t gotta come find us, we’ll find you, bitch. I’m on that muthafucka. Come to L.A., we’re gonna shut you down, bitch.
“We’re gonna smack the fuck out this pussy bitch. We stand on business. N-gga gonna slap him. Fuck him, fuck Toronto. Fuck Top5. Fuck his sister, fuck his daughter. He threatening us, it’s all off the table now. You threaten us, fuck your whole family.”

Kick streamer Adin Ross then waded into the feud and responded: “I’m not banned from L.A., bro. I wish somebody would, I swear to God. I’m gonna go to L.A., nobody’s gonna do shit to me, I promise you, bro. You think I’m scared of L.A.? What? I’ve lived in L.A. for years and years.
“Fuck that old ass muthafucka on that podcast. I’ll smack the shit out of you — well, not me but I’ma have security smack the fuck outta you and beat your ass.”
Smac really spazzed out when he heard Top5 threatened Kendrick: 
“It’s all off the table now …you threatening us? …Get it in blood, trick!”
