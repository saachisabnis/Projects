Kendrick Lamar shocked the world once again by dropping a brand-new album. On Friday, November 22, the Compton native debuted his latest album GNX via pgLang. The project comes with 12 fresh tracks beginning with "wacced out murals," in which he alludes to his beef with Drake, and ending with "Gloria" featuring SZA. The TDE crooner also appears on "Luther," which contains a sample of Luther Vandross' "If This World Were Mine." "I never peace it up, that s**t don't sit well with me/Before I take a truce I take 'em to hell with me," Lamar raps on the introductory track.

The also includes "squabble up," a song he teased at the beginning of his "Not Like Us" video earlier this year. His long-awaited song samples Debbie Deb's "When I Hear Music." It also holds "Heart Pt. 6," which bares the same name as Drake's final response to Kendrick during their beef. Lamar also recruited Roddy Ricch, Ink, Sam Dew, Mustard, Jack Antonoff and more to throw down on the album. Right before the album dropped, Kendrick Lamar shared a teaser for GNX. The minute-long clip opens with a scene of K.Dot getting out of a 1987 black Buick Regal GNX. His verse plays but he doesn't physically recite it. Instead the camera slowly zooms in as he stands besides the vehicle and walks to the center of a massive white showroom."Quiet on set but my aura loud I never gained through hood s**t and wisdom," he spits. "The money out here young man/F**k holding your hand, you'll die broke trying to play victim." Listen to Kendrick Lamar's new album GNX on iHeartRadio now and watch the teaser below.
