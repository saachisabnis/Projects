Kendrick Lamar has been taunted by Drake’s associate OVO Chubbs over an alleged diss song at the 6 God he has in the stash.
Rumors began spreading earlier this week that Kendrick has a whole track lined up for Drizzy after taking aim at his longtime rival — as well as J. Cole — on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.”

The speculation stemmed from Adin Ross claiming he had knowledge of the song during a recent Kick stream.
“Past couple nights I’ve been going out … and I bumped into somebody who’s very close on this Kendrick/Drake situation,” Ross said. “There’s a bird on the street that Kendrick already has a full-on diss track ready to drop for Drake.

“Kendrick, I’m a fan of Hip Hop and if you’re gonna diss Drake, drop that shit is all I’m gonna say, bro. Yeah man, I mean, let it fly … we all wanna listen to that.”
Chubbs, who used to be Drake’s security guard, reposted Ross’ comments on his Instagram Stories and appeared to suggest that Kendrick didn’t have the balls to drop the track.
He wrote underneath the clip: “Tell That Little Boy Drop!!! But He Won’t. He Knows Better.”
Kendrick Lamar has previously shown little evidence he’s afraid of targeting Drake on wax, not least through his scathing guest verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.”
On the song, from the duo’s recently released joint album We Don’t Trust You, K. Dot unloaded a barrage of shots at his longtime rival, as well as fellow “big three” competitor J. Cole.

“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum, what? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack,” he rapped.
He also referenced Drizzy and Cole’s chart-topping collaboration “First Person Shooter”: “Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches.”

Drake himself has yet to directly respond to the diss but did deliver a defiant speech during a recent stop on his Big as the What? Tour where he declared: “There’s not a n-gga on this Earth that could ever fuck with me in my life!”
He also wrote in an Instagram post: “They rather go to war with me than admit they are their own worst enemy.”
Cole, for his part, has stayed silent.
