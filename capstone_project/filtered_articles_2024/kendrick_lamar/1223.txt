Halle Bailey looked red hot as she arrived at the 2024 MTV VMAs held at the UBS Arena in Elmont, New York on Wednesday evening.
The 24-year-old singer put on a busty display in a strapless dress with intricate beaded embroidery and sexy cutouts highlighting her incredible, post-baby body. 
Modeling a monochromatic, red outfit, the Little Mermaid actress turned heads as she joined the best dressed bombshells leading the star parade on the red carpet.
Her stunning dress featured a structured, bullet bra-inspired bust and an asymmetrical, deep V-cut neckline. 
The ankle-length hemline of her glamorous garb was decorated with long, floor-sweeping fringe, which acted like a curtain to her chic sandal heels with satin straps.

The Color Purple star — who announced the birth of her baby boy Halo in January after her secret pregnancy — rocked a bold, crimson-colored lip, which perfectly matched her ruby red dress and Jimmy Choo shoes.
For the rest of her makeup, she opted for a sultry, cat-eye look with dramatic winged eyeliner and full, wispy lashes.  
She styled her braids into a high ponytail with a long, luscious plait that cascaded down her back.
On the red carpet, Bailey spoke about her latest single, Because I Love You, which debuted recently and landed on several top hits charts.
Her new single, which she dropped on August 30, marks her third consecutive single that has debuted in the top five on Billboard's R&B Digital Song Sales chart. 
The release of her new track follows the success of her songs In Your Hands and Angel. 
She co-wrote Because I Love You with RAYE and collaborated with Dem Jointz to produce the track. 
Her award show appearance comes after she enjoyed a trip frolicking across Europe with her family. 
The 24-year-old singer put on a busty display in a strapless dress with intricate beaded embroidery and sexy cutouts highlighting her incredible, post-baby body. Modeling a monochromatic, red outfit, the Little Mermaid actress turned heads as she joined the best dressed bombshells leading the star parade on the red carpet
Her stunning dress featured a structured, bullet bra-inspired bust and an asymmetrical, deep V-cut neckline
In July, she shared photos of her family in Italy and unveiled her son's face for the very first time after she gave birth six months ago. 
Music's biggest stars are back for another night of celebration at MTV's legendary Video Music Awards.
This year's festivities will be hosted by rapper Megan Thee Stallion and will be held at the UBS Arena in Long Island on September 11. 
Stallion, 29, is herself nominated for five awards, including best collaboration and best hip-hop. She previously won best power anthem for Hot Girl Summer.
The evening will be a who's who of music superstars with Sabrina Carpenter, Katy Perry, Camila Cabello, GloRilla, Rauw Alejandro, Benson Boone, Halsey, LISA, Lenny Kravitz, Anitta, Karol G, LL Cool J, and Shawn Mendes all set to perform at the show. 
The MTV VMAs will air live on 8pm ET/PT.
This year's recipient of the legendary Video Vanguard Award will be Katy Perry.  
'Katy is a musical powerhouse and true pop culture icon,' said Bruce Gillmer, chief content officer of music at Paramount+ and president of music, music talent, programming and events at Paramount in a statement.
The ankle-length hemline of her glamorous garb was decorated with long, floor-sweeping fringe, which acted like a curtain to her chic sandal heels with satin straps
She styled her braids into a high ponytail with a long, luscious plait that cascaded down her back
The Color Purple star rocked a bold, crimson-colored lip, which perfectly matched her ruby red dress and shoes. For the rest of her makeup, she opted for a sultry, cat-eye look with dramatic winged eyeliner and full, wispy lashes
'With her game changing creative vision, she has become a global phenomenon and taken over the world’s biggest stages,' added Gillmer.
Past winners of the Video Vanguard Award include David Bowie, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pink. 
The award comes as Perry prepares to release her upcoming seventh studio album 143. 
Her comeback single from the album, Woman's World, flopped in the charts following its release over the summer.
As for accolades, Taylor Swift is the most-nominated artist at the event with an impressive 10 nods to her name. 
The hitmaker, 34, has the chance to make history as she could become the first artist to win Video Of The Year five times. She already holds the record for most Video of the Year victories with four trophies under her name. 
Her collaboration with Post Malone, the track Fortnight, is up for Video of the Year.  
Post Malone trails Taylor by just one nomination as he has earned nine total with most of them being from their collaboration.
At the award show, she showcased her incredible figure after she welcomed her baby earlier this year
At the beginning of the year, she announced the birth of her baby boy Halo after her secret pregnancy
The one nomination he received without Taylor's assistance was for Best Collaboration for I Had Some Help, his track with Morgan Wallen.
Also up for six nominations are Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, and Eminem.
Like Megan Thee Stallion, SZA is up for five nominations.  
Meanwhile, Olivia Rodrigo, Teddy Swims, and Blackpink member Lisa all tied with four nods each. 
Finally Benson Boone, Anitta, Dua Lipa, Tyla, Bleachers, and GloRilla all have three nominations.
To finish off her look, she opted for bright, white gold jewelry.
With her hair pulled back, her dangling diamond earrings were on full display. 
She also sported identical bangle bracelets on both wrists.
On her well-manicured hands, she added several, stunning eternity rings.
