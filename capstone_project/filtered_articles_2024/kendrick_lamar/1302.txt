4Batz, who was recently signed to OVO Sound, has made it clear that he doesn’t want any smoke with Kendrick Lamar, who has been on a rampage against label co-founder Drake for days on end.
Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday (May 4), the up-and-coming singer begged the Compton native for mercy so as not to compete in sales or streams with his new project U Made Me a St4r.

The post — which read, “yo @kendricklamar I just dropped my tape my nigga can I get 24hrs at least [crying laughing emojis] — was quickly deleted.
Part of 4Batz’s concerns had to do with the release of “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar’s third diss track in just as many days, where he doubled down on serious accusations against Drake.

The track, which was released on Saturday (May 4), doubles down on the Compton native’s previous claims of the Toronto actor-turned-rapper’s predilection for young children.
“Say Drake, I hear you like ’em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any bitch that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your little sister from him,” he spits.

But he didn’t stop there. In addition to making the diss track art a photo of Drizzy’s home in Toronto — complete with “tags” that imply the residents are registered sex offenders (“Certified lover boy, certified pedophiles“) — K. Dot implied that Drizzy slept with Lil Wayne‘s then girlfriend while the Young Money rapper was locked up on a gun charge in New York.
“Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that’s connivin’ / Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizing,” he spit.

Kendrick Lamar’s unrelenting attacks on Drake have been hailed as a master class in diss tracks.
In the early hours of Friday (May 3), K.Dot amped up the rivalry by dropping “6:16 in LA.” A follow-up to “euphoria” from earlier in the week, the cut alleges that people in Drizzy’s own team are praying on his downfall and even leaking information to his adversaries.

That same evening, the Canadian superstar responded with a seven-plus minute joint packaged with a music video that shows a 1996 Chrysler Town & Country (the same make and model of car displayed on the cover art of good kid, m.A.A.d city‘s deluxe edition) being taken to the junkyard and crushed.
In addition to reprising the “Drop, Drop, Drop” from the “Push Ups” outro, the 6 God takes the war of words to a new place by accusing his rival of domestic violence, insincere racial activism, distancing himself from his native state of California and nudging 2Pac‘s estate to have his “Taylor Made Freestyle” removed from social-media platforms, among countless other jabs.
