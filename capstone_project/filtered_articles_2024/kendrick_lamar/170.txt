Juvenile has joined the chorus of criticism against Lil Wayne being snubbed for next year’s Super Bowl halftime show — but his frustration lies with the NFL, not JAY-Z.
In a video shared on Instagram on Monday (September 9), the former Cash Money rapper sounded off on the controversy surrounding Weezy not performing at Super Bowl LIX, a gig he had openly coveted given it takes place in his hometown of New Orleans.

While some prominent Hip Hop figures have accused Hov, who helps organize the Super Bowl halftime show, of intentionally denying his one-time rival the opportunity in favor of Kendrick Lamar, Juvie’s anger is directed higher up the NFL hierarchy.
“So everybody wants me to speak on this Super Bowl situation,” he began. “Look, I’m mad about the situation just like y’all, but my hatred is towards the NFL — not really the people that booked the halftime show. I’m mad at the people that hired the muthafuckas that booked the halftime show!

“I feel like y’all should step in. Y’all done had 11 Super Bowls in New Orleans, man. Y’all have yet to put a Hip Hop artist from New Orleans on the damn Super Bowl!”
He continued: “I feel like every time y’all come here, y’all should have somebody from our city on the shit. But this time it really hits hard when you don’t have Lil Wayne on the show.
“I don’t see how the fuck y’all don’t have Lil Wayne doing the halftime show. Somebody that has a whole bunch of fucking hits and somebody that really deserves it and somebody that can bring out multiple artists of all genres. Think about it.”
Juvenile then called out NFL commissioner Roger Goodell: “So this goes to you, Roger Goodell, you need to get it right, man. You coming to our city, sucking up out culture and making all this money and putting all this bread in your pocket and other people’s pockets and leaving us to hang out dry. It gotta stop.”

Fellow Cash Money almunus Nicki Minaj also vented about Lil Wayne’s Super Bowl snub in a heated social media rant, although she had a very different stance towards JAY-Z.
In a series of explosive yet subliminal posts on X, she accused the Roc Nation boss of “denying” Weezy the Super Bowl halftime show out of “hatred” of herself, Birdman and Drake, as well as his own “ego.”

The Pink Friday 2 rapper also called Hov “spiteful,” “evil” and “disgusting,” labeled him a “house n-gger” and claimed he’s in bed with the police and politicians.
Birdman later echoed Nicki’s sentiments by tweeting: “These n-ggaz Pussi @NICKIMINAJ@Drake@LilTunechi YMCMB. I’m make these n-ggaz respek us on Gladys [goat emoji]. Hatin shit 4real.”

JAY-Z has yet to address the backlash, but in a statement coinciding with the initial Super Bowl announcement, he praised Kendrick Lamar as “a once-in-a-generation artist.”
“His deep love for Hip Hop and culture informs his artistic vision,” he added. “He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendrick’s work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come.”
