Kendrick Lamar hasn’t pulled any punches during his ongoing beef with Drake, and some of the claims he’s made on the diss tracks taking aim at his foe have fulfilled a prophecy Shane Gillis made on his podcast all the way back in 2019.
Based on the information that’s come to light since the feud reached a tipping point, it seems like Kendrick Lamar spent more than a decade resisting the urge to go scorched earth on Drake before the Toronto rapper gave him an excuse to do exactly that by taking aim at him in a couple of songs that dropped in April.
Since then, K-Dot has used the four tracks he’s released as of this writing to accuse Drake of being a culture vulture, a deadbeat dad, and a snake who’s reviled by members of his own inner circle to the point where they were willing to leak inside information to make him look bad.
However, nothing has garnered more attention than the explosive claim Kendrick made on “Not Like Us” while accusing Drake of engaging in inappropriate behavior with minors. While there’s no concrete evidence that suggests he’s done anything illegal, the assertions have led to renewed interest in his relationship with Millie Bobbie Brown and an old clip of him interacting with a 17-year-old he once invited on stage.
There’s another old clip that’s also made the rounds courtesy of Shane Gillis, as the comedian was very ahead of the curve based on the prediction he issued during an episode of Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast in the summer of 2019.
Shane Gillis in 2019: “Drake likes em young, he’s gonna get got in the next 5 years”
Kendrick in 2024: Say Drake, I hear you like em young”
Poetic Justice 😂

The duo was discussing the Jeffery Epstein scandal during a conversation that eventually turned to R. Kelly before Gillis decided to shift his focus to Drake, saying:
“I want to be on the record: Drake’s on that R. Kelly tip. Drizzy Drake likes ’em young. He does. 
It’s somewhat known already. This is one of those things where you gotta say something. Remember Louis [C.K.]? That whole thing? We knew about that and we were just like, ‘Eh, I don’t know.’
Drake’s into the young ones. He’s gonna get got in the next five years.”
That episode was released around four years and nine months before Kendrick floated similar accusations, so congratulations to Shane for nailing his prediction.
