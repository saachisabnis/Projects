	While hosting the 2024 ESPYs on Thursday, Serena Williams marked the occasion by sharing some sage advice. 

	“If I’ve learned anything this year, it’s that none of us, not a single one of us, not even me, should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar,” she said as the song “Not Like Us” began to play and Williams crip-walked on stage. As the crowd clapped in approval, she added: “He will make your hometown not like you, the next time Drake sits courtside at a Raptors game, they’re gonna Forest Gump him, seats taken”

	The tennis legend previously declared “Not Like” us the song of the summer during a panel discussion at Essence Fest in New Orleans earlier this month. “I love that song. It’s like the hit of the summer,” she said. “When they play that jam, I’m jamming. That jam is jamming.”

	“You definitely Crip walking in that song. It’s so cool what he did though. Bringing everyone to the stage? That was incredible … I couldn’t believe it,” the Compton native added, referencing Lamar’s now legendary Juneteenth Pop Out concert where he brought a host of artists and celebrities on stage including DJ Mustard, Dom Kennedy, Tyler the Creator, YG, Ty Dolla $ign, Blxst, Roddy Rich, and Dr. Dre.

	On the explosive track, Lamar name-drops Williams: “From Alondra down to Central, n—a better not speak on Serena.” For a refresher, Williams and Drake were rumored to be romantically involved in 2011 and four years later, were spotted locking lips by TMZ.

	Williams married Alexis Ohanian in 2017, and in 2022, Drake dissed the Reddit co-founder on his 2022 Her Loss track “Middle of the Ocean,” rapping: “Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie/ He claim we don’t got a problem but/ No, boo, it is like you coming for sushi.”

	In a post on X/Twitter at the time, Ohanian seemed to allude to the jab, writing, “The reason I stay winning is because I’m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter.”
