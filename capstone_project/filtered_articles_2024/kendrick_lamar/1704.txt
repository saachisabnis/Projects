Ab-Soul is over people “pretending” to underestimate and overlook his talents. On Monday (Dec. 16), Soulo hit X/Twitter for a rare rant, addressing what he perceives as fans undervaluing his art and pointing to his latest album, Soul Burger, as proof.  

	“THIS MAY BE DISTASTEFUL FOR ME TO SAY ON MY OWN, GIVEN THE INSATIABLE STATE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT, FUCC IT,” he started his mini-rant. “SOUL BURGER IS A PHENOMENAL BODY OF WORK. I PUT IT ALL ON THE TABLE. STOP PRETENDING TO OVERLOOK ME. ITS UNBECOMING OF THE CULTURE…I WILL BE HEARD. MARK MY WORD. LONG LIVE @DOEBURGER.”

	










	As Kendrick Lamar and Drake (mostly Kendrick) dominated Hip-Hop in 2024, Soulo’s LP will probably become one of those projects that fans will reconsider as they head into 2025. Soul Burger was released on Nov. 8, 2025, and featured 15 songs in total. The moody and retrospective album is stacked with guest appearances from other emcees such as Lupe Fiasco, Vince Staples, JID, Ty Dolla $ign, Doechii, Blxst, Problem, TDE’s president, Punch, and more.

	Soulo previously shared what inspired his sixth studio album. During an interview with DJ Hed back in October, Ab-Soul expressed how Doe Burger, his best friend, passing away made him confront death from a different vantage point, ultimately leading to this body of work.

	“The idea came to fruition after [Doe Burger]’s transition and it’s just something that was very important for me to do ’cause I don’t even know how I’m really still doing this without him,” he told Hed. “That’s how tight-knit we were… He wasn’t no hype man or hangaround; he was really my big homie. He was really the star of it. He put the glow on it. I just been tryna channel him. I got my hair braided — that was against my religion — I got jewelry on.”

	“I just been trying to channel him, and my best way of doing that is through the music. Hence the title—it’s the fusion of me and him. We was literally Huey and Riley from The Boondocks. To where this album is not me, it’s Soul Burger. That’s not me. It’s like a new artist. It’s not an Ab-Soul project, it’s a Soul Burger project, so I recommend everybody listen to it in terms of that.”

	When you get the chance, spin Soulo’s album one time for the one time — there are rich and dense layers to the music that longtime and new fans of TDE would appreciate.
