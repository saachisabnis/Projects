“I have had an insane week,” he said. “You guys know what’s coming for you. Party and Drake have a classic. And we, you know, we trying to put the finishing touches on it, so. Yeah, it’s a jam-packed month for me filled with the thing that I love to do the most.”
The conversation happens around the 1:37:21 mark below.
In August, PARTYNEXTDOOR revealed there will be 15 songs on the project – which was announced the week prior during his PARTYNEXTDOOR & Friends concert at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage
“I know all you girls are outside and when it gets a little chilly, PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake album will be right there for you,” Drake said as he made a surprise appearance on stage.

No release date has been announced, aside from Drake’s hint that the project will be out “when it gets a little chilly.”
Hopefully the LP will mark Drizzy’s return to the Billboard Hot 100, as for the first time since April 2022, he did not have a single song or feature on the chart last week.

In other news, Drake is definitely “hurting” following the Kendrick Lamar beef, at least as far as Charlamagne Tha God sees it.
Last weekend, Drizzy dropped by a party in Toronto and hopped on the mic to talk about how friends can betray you before throwing to Beyoncé‘s “Me, Myself & I.”

While discussing the speech on The Breakfast Club, the radio host shared his thoughts on the moment, expressing that it clearly shows how hurt he feels in the wake of his highly-publicized battle.
“That was by far one of the top three most beige moments in light-skin history. I thought that Kendrick’s execution of this battle was flawless – the strategy, the songs, everything – but I didn’t think that it had that much of an impact on Drake,” he said.

“Drake is hurting! Oh my God! He is hurt! You can’t go on an unfollow spree then go on a stage and cry about not having no real friends or whatever that was about and go into Beyoncé’s ‘Me, Myself & I.’ When I tell you Kendrick Lamar put his foot all the way up Drake’s ass…”
“One thing about Nostalgia, this party here, my real friends are definitely in the building,” Drake said in his initial speech.

“But I’m gonna tell you, you’re gonna come to a point in life where people you thought were friends, or people you thought were close to you, they might switch up, they might try fighting with you, they might stab you in the back, they might do a lot of things to you.
“You’ll come to that realization. Wherever you’re at in life, you’ve probably been there, and you’ll be there again. That’s how life is.
