It appears Snoop Dogg is unfazed by Drake using artificial intelligence to mimic his voice on his new Kendrick Lamar diss track, "Taylor Made Freestyle."
Following the release of Drake's diss track "Taylor Made Freestyle," which targets K-Dot, fans were shocked that Drizzy used A.I. to mimic the voices of West Coast rap icons Tupac Shakur and Snoop in the song. Surprisingly, the Doggfather appeared unfazed by Drake imitating his voice on the track.
On Friday (April 19), Snoop posted a video on his Instagram page reacting to the hoopla over his fake voice appearing on Drake's song.
"They did what? When? How? Are you sure? [Sigh] Y’all have a good night," the rap veteran said in the IG clip, which can be viewed below. "Why everybody calling my phone, blowing me up? What the f**k— what happened? What's going on? I'm going back to bed. Good night."
It's not clear if Snoop Dogg was tipped off that his A.I. voice was going to be used on Drake's diss track.
On Friday (April 19), Drake surprised fans by posting on his IG account another diss track aimed at Kendrick Lamar called "Taylor Made Freestyle."
