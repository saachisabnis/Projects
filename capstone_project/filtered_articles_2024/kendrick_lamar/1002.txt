In  the course of a week, Drake’s mansion in Toronto has been  the site of a shooting and two separate incidents of alleged trespassing. 
Toronto police officers reported back to the “God’s Plan” rapper’s home Thursday afternoon after receiving a call about a trespasser at the Bridle Path property, The Times confirmed. The call came in  around 3:30 p.m.  
Before police arrived  at the scene, the alleged trespasser was taken to the hospital after an altercation with security guards on the property. Toronto police are  investigating Thursday’s incident, a spokesperson told The Times.

The shooting outside Drake’s Toronto mansion comes amid his public feud with Kendrick Lamar. For weeks, the two rappers have traded scathing diss tracks.
Thursday marked the third consecutive day Toronto police responded to Drake’s home this week. First, police responded to a shooting that occurred early Tuesday.   Police Inspector Paul Krawczyk confirmed in a press conference earlier this week that upon their arrival, officers found a  security guard for the property suffering from a gunshot wound. 
The guard, whose identity was not revealed, was allegedly “shot while standing outside the gates in front of” Drake’s home and hospitalized with “life-threatening injuries,” police said in a release published Tuesday
During Tuesday’s press conference, Krawczyk said the suspects involved in the shooting  drove up in a vehicle, but he did not share further details, including a motive. He also did not confirm whether Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, was home at the time of the shooting, but said  the rapper’s team  was cooperating with the police investigation.

The feud between the two superstar rappers appeared to climax over the weekend. What will it mean for their careers going forward?
On Wednesday,  police returned to Drake’s home  in response to a report of an attempted  break-in. Police detained the  suspect on the scene for an evaluation under Canada’s Mental Health Act,  a spokesperson confirmed to The Times. As of Thursday, the alleged trespasser  had not been  charged. 
The three  incidents  come amid Drake’s  highly public feud with rapper Kendrick Lamar. For weeks, the  Grammy-winning musicians have traded diss tracks filled with scathing allegations,  including domestic violence and child sex abuse. For the cover art on his “Not Like Us” diss, Lamar used a Google Earth image of Drake’s home pinned with multiple red “sex offender markers,” according to online fans. 
As the two traded tracks,  artists including J. Cole, Rick Ross, ASAP Rocky and Metro Boomin also joined the fray. 
During  the press briefing Tuesday, Krawczyk acknowledged the ongoing beef between Drake and Lamar, but  emphasized that investigators  had not yet identified a motive. “I cannot comment further on that,” he said. 
Krawczyk added that  authorities collected  some video evidence that captured the shooting. The investigation is ongoing.
