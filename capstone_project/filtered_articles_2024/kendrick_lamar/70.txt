After his scorching series of Drake diss tracks from this past May, rapper Kendrick Lamar is back with a brand-new song.
While the new song doesn't seem to be a direct Drake beef track like his last few, we're sure that some of the track hints at the simmering beef between the two rap superstars.
Perhaps the new song is just a one-off track from an artist whose banner year has come off of them, or perhaps this is the start of an album rollout for Lamar.
His last album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, came out in 2022, which means he may hypothetically be ready to release a new record this year.
The new song comes in the same week that Lamar revealed he'll play the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans.
You can hear the song below from Lamar's Instagram page.
