This trio, Ifedayo Gatling, Dennis Bailey, and George Marage, got their musical journey started back in 2019. They began as a duo when Gatling and Marage studied under the same mentor, learning about the combination of 60’s inspired gospel music and more contemporary funk and soul.


The group released their first album, “He’s On Time”, in 2019 earning them comparison to some of the greats such as Elton John, and even slots in music festivals like Telluride Jazz. This new album is the group’s attempt at making music that bends genres and makes the listener reconsider the idea of categorizing music.


The highlighted track, “Somebody’s Watching You” features some beautiful singing that sticks with you even after the song ends.

When Gambino shifted into a more serious tone while maintaining his whimsy, he really began to shine as a musician. This album came shortly after the release of “Atavista”, allowing Childish Gambino to solidify his spot as a staple summer artist.

This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.

This album came shortly after the release of “Atavista”, allowing Childish Gambino to solidify his spot as a staple summer artist.

In 2019, she released her first full-length project, “Immunity” which kept all the soft qualities fans had come to love with some higher quality production and clarity.

After no album release for 3 years, fans were enthralled when Clairo announced “Charm”. The lead single, “Sexy to Someone”, showed a new side of Clairo. The artist-led into a new style of instrumentation with piano and woodwinds heavy in the mix. The release cycle also saw the artist’s first music video in 6 years, for the track “Juna”.

1)Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)
Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “Image”, features rolling synths and sweet vocal melodies. The build-up of the guitars in the background is guaranteed to make you want to dance.


    
Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, started his musical career in 2011 with his album “Camp”. He was known widely as a comedian who got his start as a writer for “30 Rock” before becoming an actor. Both of us on the music team were big fans of his work in the show “Community” as Troy Barnes.


His comedy background and musical inclination explain the silly nature of his earlier work. When Gambino shifted into a more serious tone while maintaining his whimsy, he really began to shine as a musician. This album came shortly after the release of “Atavista”, allowing Childish Gambino to solidify his spot as a staple summer artist. Glover has also stated that this album will serve as the soundtrack to an upcoming movie of the same title.


The highlighted track this week is “Lithonia”, which gives gospel vocals and some Midwest emo vibes.

Songs like “Pretty Girl” and “Flaming Hot Cheetos” garnered the singer/songwriter swarms of fans, eager to hear what she could do on a record. In 2019, she released her first full-length project, “Immunity” which kept all the soft qualities fans had come to love with some higher quality production and clarity. Tracks “Bags” and “Sofia” from this project remain popular among fans and casual listeners alike.


After no album release for 3 years, fans were enthralled when Clairo announced “Charm”. The lead single, “Sexy to Someone”, showed a new side of Clairo. The artist-led into a new style of instrumentation with piano and woodwinds heavy in the mix. The release cycle also saw the artist’s first music video in 6 years, for the track “Juna”.

1)Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)
Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “Image”, features rolling synths and sweet vocal melodies. The build-up of the guitars in the background is guaranteed to make you want to dance.
