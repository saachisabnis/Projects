We previously reported that Kendrick Lamar joined Future and Metro Boomin on their new album We Don’t Trust You. In one of his verse- he gave the internet something they were not expecting as he raps, “Yeah, get up with me, f*ck sneak dissing/’First Person Shooter,’ I hope they came with three switches,” on the single “Like That” taking direct shots at Drake and J. Cole.
“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/Motherfuck the Big 3, n***a, it’s just big me” dissing J. Cole as he rapped, “Love when they argue the hardest MC/Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?”
“We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali” rapped Cole on Drake’s chart-topping single, First Person Shooter. Obviously- Kendrick disagreed.
Drake addressed the diss while on stage suggesting, “I got my head up high, my back straight, I’m ten f**king toes down… and I know no matter what there’s not another n**** on this Earth that could ever f*ck with me.”
