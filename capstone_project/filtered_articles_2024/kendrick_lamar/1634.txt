Snoop Dogg recently weighed in on the much-discussed rap beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, offering some insightful commentary that's got the hip-hop world buzzing. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the West Coast icon refrained from taking sides but couldn't help but acknowledge the impact of the lyrical showdown.
According to Snoop, the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has raised the bar for lyricism and songwriting in the rap game. "I want to give both of them a shout out for raising the bar as far as lyrics, as far as song-making and writing," he remarked.
But it's not just about the music; Snoop believes this feud has had a lasting impact on the hip-hop landscape. "They made you rap again," he stated, suggesting that the era of mumble rap and gimmicks might be on the decline.
Despite his admiration for both artists, Snoop made it clear that he's staying out of the drama. "Those are my nephews," he said. "I'm not in the middle of it. I support both of them, and that's personal business, not my business."
However, even with his neutrality, Snoop Dogg found himself unexpectedly drawn into the beef. Drake's diss track, "Taylor Made Freestyle," features an A.I.-generated recreation of Snoop Dogg and Tupac's voices, further entangling the rap legend in the feud.
In essence, Snoop Dogg's take on the Drake-Kendrick Lamar beef highlights its significance not just as entertainment but as a pivotal moment in hip-hop history, reshaping the genre for years to come.
