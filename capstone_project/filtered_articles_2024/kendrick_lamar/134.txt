Kendrick Lamar and Drake‘s feud has already produced a number of scathing diss tracks from each side, and Akademiks has now taken a closer look at some of the imagery surrounding the music.
On Friday (May 3), soon after K.Dot responded to Drizzy’s “Family Matters” diss track within an hour by unleashing “meet the grahams,” the internet personality went live on Rumble to share his reaction to the back-and-forth. During the stream, he even claimed to receive information from the Compton MC’s team about the meaning behind his latest offering’s cover art (which features, among other things, what appears to be a prescription for Ozempic, a drug frequently used for weight loss in Drake’s name), though this has yet to be verified.

“Akademiks got intel from Kendrick’s camp that the details of the cover of ‘Meet the Grahams’ containing a glove, ozempic, receipts etc was stolen from a suitcase that belonged to Dennis Graham, Drake’s father,” the 32-year-old wrote in a TikTok post.
“This cover art contains things that is from Drake’s pops’ suitcase, so Drake’s pops’ suitcase had these things in it,” he said. “Don’t know how he got a hold of it, don’t know how this happened to get in Kendrick’s hand. But apparently Kendrick Lamar must’ve got a hold of Drake’s dad’s suitcase. So we’re talking about Dennis Graham, which is Drake’s pops […] remember all that talk about leaks in the camp?”

The Los Angeles MC amped up the rivalry earlier this week by dropping “6:16 in LA,” on which he questions Ak’s objectivity in the matter with the bar: “Yeah, somebody’s lyin’, I can see the vibes on Ak/ Even he lookin’ compromised.”
A follow up to “euphoria” from earlier in the week, the cut alleges that people in the 6 God’s own team are praying on his downfall and even leaking information to his adversaries.

Later that same day, the Canadian superstar responded with a seven-plus minute joint and accused his rival of domestic violence, insincere racial activism, distancing himself from his native state of California and nudging 2Pac‘s estate to have his “Taylor Made Freestyle” removed from social-media platforms, among countless other jabs.
Less than an hour later, the good kid, m.A.A.d city rapper posted his rebuttal. “meet the grahams” clocks in at roughly six-and-a-half minutes and addresses each member of Drake’s immediate family — Adonis (son), Sandy (mother) and Dennis (father) — in addition to the Toronto MC himself, who is referred to by his real name, Aubrey Graham.
