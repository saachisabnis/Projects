According to a new Bloomberg report, Jay-Z and the NFL have extended their creative partnership, with the rap superstar and his Roc Nation entertainment company continuing to curate the musical performances at the Super Bowl Halftime Show into the future. While the length and financial details of the new deal have yet to be released, the original agreement they signed in 2019 was worth $25 million over five years. At the NFL owners meeting in Atlanta on Tuesday (October 15), NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said, “It’s been a mutually positive relationship. I’m not sure either one of us really spend much time talking about contracts. Jay is happy. [Roc Nation CEO] Desiree Perez is happy. I’m happy, so we’re all good.” Jay-Z chose Kendrick Lamar to headline the upcoming 2025 halftime show, saying at the time, “Kendrick Lamar is truly a once-in-a-generation artist and performer. He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally.” (Uproxx)
