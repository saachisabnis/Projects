Lil Wayne had made no secret of his desire to headline the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show, which takes place in his hometown of New Orleans.
“As an artist, this is an achievement,” he said in an interview with Taylor Rooks last year. “This has nothing to do with the sport. That’s so crazy. I don’t care what teams are playing, what city it’s in. ‘You performed for the what?!’ Like, what? Oh man, that right there is an achievement.”
Weezy had even received the support of former NFL star turned college football coach Deion Sanders, who promised to “put a phone call in” to help make it happen.

But his dream was dashed this past weekend when it was announced that Kendrick Lamar will perform at Super Bowl LIX at the Caesars Superdome on February 9.
Kendrick will become the first rapper to headline the halftime show by himself, adding to Dr. Dre‘s star-studded set two years ago which featured a cameo from the Compton rap star, as well as Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige and surprise guest 50 Cent.
While it’s hard to dispute K. Dot’s selection, considering his chart-topping Drake diss “Not Like Us” dominated the summer in the midst of his unanimous victory over the 6 God (who caught another stray in Kendrick’s announcement video), Lil Wayne fans are taking the news hard.
It begs the question: if not now, when?

Several prominent rappers have been quick to voice their disapproval with the decision, with some even pointing the finger at JAY-Z and Roc Nation, who have helped organize the halftime show since 2020.
While neither Wayne, Kendrick nor Hov have yet to address the commotion, what was supposed to be a historic and celebratory moment for K. Dot has been dampened by the disappointment over Weezy’s perceived Super Bowl snub.
From Nicki Minaj and Birdman to Juvenile and Master P, here are all the rappers who have come out in defense of Weezy F. Baby.
No rapper has been more vocal about Lil Wayne being passed over for the Super Bowl halftime show than his Cash Money disciple Nicki Minaj.
In an explosive yet subliminal social media rant, she accused JAY-Z of denying her label boss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity over personal grievances with the Young Money camp.
“Denying a young black man what he rightfully put into this game for no other reason but your ego. Your hatred for BIRDMAN, Drake & Nicki got you punishing Lil Wayne?!?!!! LIL WAYNE!!!!!!!!!! THE GOAT?!!!!!!!!!!!” she wrote.

“Nola what’s good?!!!!!! Eminem stood firm on having 50Cent come out. A white man. Shit sad. House N-GGER TINGZ. but it’s GOOD FI DEM!!!!!!! No loyalty ? Welp. then n-ggaz will keep son’ing you!!!!!”
She added: “Got everything in the world. Still spiteful & evil. Disgusting. Be happy Abeg. Go be fkng happy n!gg@!!!!!!!! In rap business. In women business. When you got the Politicians & the police you good tho. Plus dat ugly laughy taffy alien.”
Nicki continued speaking up for mentor and collaborator, writing: “God forbid if Wayne was to leave this earth right now, the culture would be in mourning. That’s why so many ppl keep saying to give our legends their flowers while they are still around to smell them.

“Sitting around all day playing games with ppl life & legacy. God ain’t sleep. Gee Roberson [Nicki’s former manager] you will learn that, too. Very soon.”
In response to a user who argued that Kendrick was the right pick because he “represents [Hip Hop] to its highest degree” in 2024, Nicki fired back: “God will punish you. Mark my words. The man that has not only pushed his pen the hardest, but gave the game more than 1 hip hop ICON as well on his watch?
“Represent the RAP game?!?!! The best RAPPER don’t represent the RAP GAME well enough 4u? Black ppl. Wow. If this don’t hurt your heart to read, it will one day. Look @ how our legends keep being treated. After they’ve given so much to us.

“Who are you?!!!! You GOD?!?!!!!! Judgmental swine DELETE!!!!!!! lol you will regret tweeting this. Life is funny that way. Don’t you dare turn your nose up @ Lil Wayne you dick munchin bozo.”
Nicki later clarified her feelings towards Kendrick, making it clear that she didn’t mean to disparage him: “You can love & respect Kendrick and still love & respect Wayne. Even Kendrick loves & respects Wayne. Every real rapper loves & respects Wayne.”

Soon after Nicki Minaj’s tirade, Birdman also chimed in on the debate surrounding Lil Wayne not being chosen as the halftime performer for Super Bowl LIX.
He, too, appeared to throw a jab at JAY-Z, tweeting: “These n-ggaz Pussi @NICKIMINAJ @Drake @LilTunechi YMCMB. I’m make these n-ggaz respek us on Gladys,” referencing his mother, Gladys Brooks.
In a second post, the Cash Money mogul added: “Hatin shit 4real.”

Of course, Baby and Jigga previously had issues in 2009 when the former claimed that Lil Wayne was a better rapper than JAY-Z because, among other reasons, he “makes the most money.”
That sparked some lyrical sparring between Wayne and Hov, with financial- and family-related jabs being thrown on “H.A.M.,” “It’s Good” and “La Familia.”
However, mutual respect always existed between the Young Money and Roc Nation figureheads and they later patched things up. In 2018, Wayne even revealed that Jay helped him pay off a hefty multimillion-dollar tax bill, calling him a “real friend.”

Killa Cam shared his unfiltered thoughts on the NFL’s decision to book Kendrick Lamar for the Super Bowl on his sports talk show It Is What It Is.
He began by singing K. Dot’s praises, saying: “Listen, I love Kendrick Lamar, I love the Pop Out. I think he’s one of the top artist of this generation, period,” before bluntly admitting: “Hate the selection.”
“It’s in New Orleans and you don’t get Lil Wayne? That’s what we doing? You don’t get Lil Wayne in New Orleans for the Super Bowl? It’s no reason why Lil Wayne should not be performing at the Super Bowl,” Cam added.

The Dipset rapper then blamed his former Roc-A-Fella boss JAY-Z.
“It’s one person who’s stopping this. It’s not really a secret,” he continued, albeit without naming names. “Lil Wayne had a problem with somebody before who’s kinda part of the organization running it. This is payback. Who’s Lil Wayne’s artist? Drake. This is crazy, bro. It’s ridiculous.”
He concluded by emphasizing his point once more: “Lil Wayne not to be performing in New Orleans for the Super Bowl is egregious, and it gotta stop.”
"I hate the selection."

Fellow New Orleans rap legend Juvenile also came to his former Hot Boys groupmate’s defense in a video shared on Instagram. While others have blamed JAY-Z for Wayne’s snub, Juvie’s anger is directed higher up the NFL hierarchy.
“So everybody wants me to speak on this Super Bowl situation,” he began. “Look, I’m mad about the situation just like y’all, but my hatred is towards the NFL — not really the people that booked the halftime show. I’m mad at the people that hired the muthafuckas that booked the halftime show!
“I feel like y’all should step in. Y’all done had 11 Super Bowls in New Orleans, man. Y’all have yet to put a Hip Hop artist from New Orleans on the damn Super Bowl!”

He continued: “I feel like every time y’all come here, y’all should have somebody from our city on the shit. But this time it really hits hard when you don’t have Lil Wayne on the show.
“I don’t see how the fuck y’all don’t have Lil Wayne doing the halftime show. Somebody that has a whole bunch of fucking hits and somebody that really deserves it and somebody that can bring out multiple artists of all genres. Think about it.”
Juvenile then called out NFL commissioner Roger Goodell: “So this goes to you, Roger Goodell, you need to get it right, man. You coming to our city, sucking up out culture and making all this money and putting all this bread in your pocket and other people’s pockets and leaving us to hang out dry. It gotta stop.”
Master P named the official “entertainment ambassador” for the 2025 Super Bowl by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell earlier this month. After Kendrick Lamar was announced as the halftime show headliner, the No Limit mogul issued a diplomatic statement congratulating Kendrick on the nod while expressing disappointment over Lil Wayne’s exclusion.
In true OG fashion, P also offered a solution, urging Kendrick to bring Weezy out on stage at the Super Bowl as a special guest.

“Salute to @kendricklamar for performing at the halftime show at Super Bowl LIX.. well deserved, he’s one of the hottest music artists in the world and has one of the biggest songs right now,” he wrote on Instagram. “As Ambassador of Entertainment in the City of New Orleans I have to agree with the fans that @liltunechi #LilWayne should be a part of this celebration as well.
“He’s one of the greatest Hop Hop artists alive, still relevant and he’s a New Orleans native. Let’s not miss this cultural moment in the South. Life is too short! We have to give our legends their flowers while they are here. @masterpmasterclass #Godisgood Change starts with us. @nfl @jayz @mayorcantrell.”
Fellow Louisiana native Boosie Badazz is not one to hold his tongue, and that was certainly the case regarding next year’s Super Bowl.
After learning that Wayne wouldn’t be headlining the halftime show, he vented on X: “ALL YALL ACTING LIKE YALL COOL WITH HOW THEY PLAYING IT FOR THE SUPERBOWL SMH THE MOST CULTURAL CITY N THE USA( NEW ORLÉANS)ITS A SMACK N THE FACE TO EVERY HIP HOP LEGEND FROM LOUISIANA @MasterPMiller @BIRDMAN5STAR.

Hurricane Chris, who also hails from the Bayou State, appeared especially angry at Lil Wayne being denied the Super Bowl halftime show, going so far as to threaten violence against outsiders.
In a video posted on Instagram, the “A Bay Bay” rapper referenced his recent triade against 50 Cent’s Humor & Harmony festival in Shreveport and claimed Wayne’s snub is further disrespect against the state of Louisiana.
“So now you n-ggas understand it, huh? Same shit that I was just saying 50 Cent did in Shreveport, now it’s happening in New Orleans on a bigger scale,” he said. “People like Master P come in on it, so now everybody understand? I just made this same fucking statement.”

Chris then warned: “When you come to the South, y’all gotta show more respect than this. We got our own culture here. N-ggas coming down here laughing, playing games, thinking they just gonna use their money and take over everything.
“It ain’t going down like that. We going back to that old fucking law. You n-ggas stepping on turf gon’ do what you supposed to do, or you gon’ pack your shit up and get the fuck on.
“All that nice guy shit is out the window. Fuck being nice, fuck trying to cop deuces. I take back every nice word I said to you n-ggas. Get your fucking mind right or we gon’ make n-ggas get their mind right. How about that?”

Hurricane Chris’ fiery rant even led to a tense exchange with Slim Jxmmi after the Rae Sremmurd rapper accused him of “reaching.”
“@slimjxmmi mind yo business unless you wanna see these hands bruh on god what’s poppin,” Chris hit back, to which Jxmmi responded: “I’ll slap the ‘A Bay Bay’ out this n-gga [100 emoji].”
