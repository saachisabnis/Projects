Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions (Part 3)
i’m halfway through cowboy carter and very confused by the ‘the voters won’t like this’ accusations?? 
I haven’t listened yet. But I assume they mean County voters won’t embrace it in Country Album.
I’m not like some music guru with superior opinions or anything but some statements here are just laughable. Albums with pretentious narratives often get better reviews and GD users ingest that so fast lol. In fact, if we were to tally albums with the highest win percentage. There’s a strong chance R.A.M had more than 21, certainly more than 24K Magic; another album techies rate, but discussions for another day. Jheeze guys, take RAM to any studio along with whatever 100-star album you like. Ask the team to recreate both and see which one they’ll struggle with. Even funnier that “Instant Crush” had better writing and more complex composition than every SOTY nominee that year, yes even Royals. The committee just had to block them to give Lorde a fighting chance. Did we even play R.A.M? Play the damn album y’all. 
I definitely think RAM is the best album to win AOTY from the 2010s on. My adoration for it isn’t quite on the level of many critics. But it’s the best. I’d place Golden Hour, When We All Fall Asleep… , 1989 behind that. Those are the only AOTY winners from the 2010s on that I’ve pretty much thoroughly liked, even if they weren’t my personal winners from the crop of nominees in their years. Folklore is a solid winner. But in a year where there was a couple of masterpieces and Taylor already had a couple of AOTY wins, it should have not been the victor. Everything is on the level of eh to okay for me. 21 was just too gigantic and voter friendly to deny. But I can’t say it’s throughout good. I’d love to have a higher opinion of The Suburbs. But I greatly prefer Arcade Fire’s first couple albums to it.

Maybe Lady Gaga has confirmed the LG7 for this year yet.

My favorite AOTY wins ranking since 2011 :
01. Taylor Swift – folklore
02. Arcade Fire – The Suburbs
03. Kacey Musgraves – Golden Hour
04. Billie Eilish – WWAFAWDWG
05. Adele – 21
06. Daft Punk – Redddddom Access Memories
07. Taylor Swift – 1989 (Still prefer TPAB tho, it was the album of the century)
08. Beck – Morning Phase (Sorry Beyhive but I like this more than Self-titled)
09. Jon Batiste – We Are
10. Taylor Swift – Midnights (Should go to The Record or SOS)
11. Adele – 25 (Lemonade was monumental, it was like the female version of TPAB)
12. Harry Styles – Harry’s House (Ren is not my favorite record from Bey but it was definitely the best among the contenders)
12. Mumford and Sons – Babel (Channel Orange was robbed)
13. Bruno Mars – 24K Magic (the fact that the award went to the worst nominee lol, Melodrama should win this)
Sexy, confident. So intelligent.
She is heaven-sent. So soft, so strong.

My only con for 21 would be the piano ballads. 
Acoustic records often need to either have advanced compositions for the solo instrument or extraordinary songwriting, else they sometimes feel incomplete or simple. Rolling in The Deep, Set Fire To The Rain, Rumour Has It and I’ll Be Waiting all felt rich to me. 
Unlike EOM and To Be Loved which both had complex vocal riffs, Someone Like You and Turning Tables never had “woah factors” to me. Even though an amateur, I learnt to play the piano for both in 2-3 listens. They both had the same bars playing in a loop, very easy. I’m sure users who play can corroborate. Their lyrics/composition and vocals felt easy to ideate and perform respectively. 
Albeit Someone Like You had a strong theme and narrative, while Turning Tables is affective.
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
Quick opinions:
– RAM aged appropriately. The album is fondly remembered by internet music “snobs” at least. The people who disavow its victory are largely popheads and sore swifties.
– I agree that being a musician among the voters doesn’t automatically make your judgement better than that of critics and audiences. There are mediocre musicians, producers and writers especially in this age of Tik Tok fast music (see: abcdefu). Someone here once said that the academy needed more Kendricks Lamar, Beyoncés and Swifts (i.e. people who take music very professionally) and he’s right.
– Personally I will say that the worst AOTY win of these times was 24K Magic, not because of anything against Bruno, but because it was a slap in the face to the musical innovation that the other contenders represented. (Babel would also get in here but outside of Chanel Orange it was a somewhat weak lineup I guess).
It's me... Hi

– Beyonce holds writing bootcamps with multiple songwriters, then merge their outputs into the songs that form her album, ask around. She does it very well but what then makes her “professional” in that context?
– Swift is a great songwriter when she makes efforts and quite creative, but an average pianist/guitarist with below average vocals/performance. Would you consider her a gold standard against say Jacob, Jon, Nile etc?
– TPAB is a 10 and Kendrick is great but remove the politically charged narratives and affective theme let’s see if GD’s opinion of him remains the same.
– What musical innovation did DAMN, Melodrama, 4:44 and Awaken, My Love bring to the table exactly? Genuinely asking for specifics.
N/B: I very much like Beyonce, Swift and especially Kendrick. Love ya more than noticeable Goldwing but I feel users accept the consensus without chewing on it or at least providing compelling justifications. 
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
Honey, there is nothing revolutionary or game-changing in this Beyonce album. We know she mostly did not write these songs like Taylor, Adele, Mariah and other authentic songwriter does. She is just parotting somebody else artistry hence country does not suit her because we know she didn’t write this.
Yeah, but she won’t do that. She’s over her pop mainstream era. This woman enjoys doing weird albums that are objectively well done and are called revolutionary or game-changing by critics and press. The album isn’t even officially out and there are already headlines calling the album the revolution of country music. She won’t leave this type of releases and won’t do anything as basic and boring as Harry’s House, Midnights or 24k Magic. Good and interesting albums are NOT winning Album Of The Year anymore. That’s the problem. Voters have to change, not Beyoncé. 
Love and respect everyone else too and certainly know within myself what I dislike about 24K Magic. Albeit I wanna hear everyone else’s because:
“It’s the worst album” = “I don’t like the album”.
Enjoying music is subjective but music quality is objective and so should deciding a winner, unless you’d agree if I claimed that “Biden sings better than Gaga”.
I have given cons for 21, my favourite winner by my favourite artist. 24KM is subjectively hated here however so doing the same for it will only underpin the notion. 
Again, no need to take my word for it but the fact that most voters chose it, not just in a few categories but everywhere, should hint that maybe we’re missing something. They further reinforced that resolve by again giving him the only sweep this decade so far.

I like 21 enough. But I prefer 30 and 19 to it. I just think they’re more interesting works, even if neither reaches the heights of “Rolling In The Deep” and “Someone Like You”. 25 winning is more problematic, with it pretty much being a more generic 21, Adele already winning, and it being a bit less successful than 21 in the long run.

I hate 30 but lowkey know it’s probably her best album. My most played album this decade yet I dislike the sound haha. Maybe I’m just salty she went contemporary. 19 was 🔥.
25 was the soundtrack to my first experience of completely falling in love 😭. The album I made the most memories with, I just can’t accept the album isn’t perfect, never!

Most country artists aren’t song writers but instead record songs written by traditional Nashville songwriting teams.
The key is that country artists aren’t pressured for vanity credits and so usually don’t seek them.
I’ll have a more full opinion of the album later. But the “Jolene” remake is so wonderfully camp 😭.
II MOST WANTED BEST COUNTRY DUO
i think that bey saying “it isnt a country album, its a beyonce album” is an obvious sign that shes submitting the album and some of the songs to americana and then a song or two to country because if she can get those americana votes, shes taking AOTY
