During a recent interview with Link Up TV, dancehall artist Popcaan made it clear where his loyalties lie—by shutting down a Kendrick Lamar song playing in the background. While discussing his career, Popcaan was interrupted by the unexpected sound of a Kendrick track blaring through the speakers. The sudden appearance of Lamar’s music seemed to irritate the Jamaican star, who immediately questioned why it was playing.
When the interviewer informed him that the song was coming from the “surround sound upstairs,” Popcaan’s frustration was evident. He quickly demanded the song be turned off, stating, “I don’t care. I don’t wanna hear that. Change the station. Weh? If a dat a play, skip dat bloodclaat! Nuh waan hear daat… Change di station!”
Popcaan’s reaction wasn’t just about his personal music preferences—it was a demonstration of his allegiance to Drake and his OVO crew. To drive the point home, Popcaan rolled up his sleeve to reveal an OVO tattoo, underscoring his commitment to the collective. Even though he recently became an independent artist, Popcaan emphasized his continued support for Drake. “Mi nuh know why di bomboclaat dem a play Kendrick Lamar in yah bout. Mi nuh waan hear no Kendrick Lamar ni**a,” he said. “All when time mi independent, an OVO mi ting deh same way. Yeh, a loyalty me deal wid.”
Popcaan has been associated with OVO since 2016, officially signing with the label in 2018. However, by 2023, he was ready to move on and become a free agent, as he shared with Crack Magazine. He expressed mixed feelings about the label, stating, “I have so much music [but] the label can be weird sometimes. I love the label, but I don’t like them. But I’ll be independent soon.” Despite stepping away from the label, Popcaan remains a loyal supporter of Drake and OVO, making it clear that his commitment runs deep.
