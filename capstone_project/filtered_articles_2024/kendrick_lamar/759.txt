Cam’ron isn’t happy with Lil Wayne being passed over as the headliner of next year’s Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans — and believes JAY-Z is to blame.
Speaking on his sports talk show It Is What It Is on Monday (September 9), the Dipset rapper shared his unfiltered thoughts on the NFL’s decision to book Kendrick Lamar to perform at Super Bowl LIX.

He began by singing K. Dot’s praises, saying: “Listen, I love Kendrick Lamar, I love the Pop Out. I think he’s one of the top artist of this generation, period,” before bluntly admitting: “Hate the selection.”
“It’s in New Orleans and you don’t get Lil Wayne? That’s what we doing? You don’t get Lil Wayne in New Orleans for the Super Bowl? It’s no reason why Lil Wayne should not be performing at the Super Bowl,” Cam added.

The Harlem native then pointed the finger at his former Roc-A-Fella boss JAY-Z, who has helped organize the Super Bowl since 2020 as the NFL’s live music entertainment strategist.
“It’s one person who’s stopping this. It’s not really a secret,” he continued, albeit without naming names. “Lil Wayne had a problem with somebody before who’s kinda part of the organization running it. This is payback. Who’s Lil Wayne’s artist? Drake. This is crazy, bro. It’s ridiculous.”
He concluded by emphasizing his point once more: “Lil Wayne not to be performing in New Orleans for the Super Bowl is egregious, and it gotta stop.”
Cam’ron’s co-host Ma$e was more supportive of the selection, saying: “I think it’s a great opportunity for him to bring the Pop Out to the Super Bowl. That would really be crazy. If you really want to make a statement, Kendrick, bring the Pop Out out on stage, bring every California artist that was at that show.”

Cam’ron was referencing Lil Wayne and JAY-Z’s rivalry in the late 2000s and early 2010s which was sparked by a hungry young Weezy vying for Jigga’s Best Rapper Alive crown.
Birdman famously ruffled feathers in 2009 when he took issue with Hov being named MTV’s Hottest MC in the Game, claiming that Wayne deserved the nod because, among other reasons, he “makes the most money.”

That prompted some lyrical sparring between the Cash Money and Roc Nation titans, with financial- and family-related jabs being thrown on “H.A.M.,” “It’s Good” and “La Familia.”
However, mutual respect always existed between the two and they appear to be firm friends these days, with Wayne and Jay reuniting on DJ Khaled‘s Grammy-nominated “God Did” last year.

Hov even once helped Weezy pay off an almost $8 million tax bill, as the “A Milli” hitmaker revealed during a 2018 show.
As for the Super Bowl snub, Lil Wayne has yet to comment on the matter himself but one of his closest collaborators has seemingly voiced his frustrations.

Posting on his Instagram Stories, the rapper’s longtime engineer Fabian Marasciullo wrote: “Confused. Disappointed. Angry. But most of all. Inspired. Will never again be in a position or have the [goat emoji] in a position where we are at the mercy of someone else’s decision. We will make the decisions.”
Wayne had been vocal about his desire to headline next year’s Super Bowl given it takes place in his hometown of New Orleans.
