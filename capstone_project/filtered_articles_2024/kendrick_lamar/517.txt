For another year, Black Americans were at the forefront of 2024's most impactful news stories. Comedian Katt Williams set the tone in January with a candid and explosive interview with Shannon Sharpe, making remarks that many believe foreshadowed the defining moments of the year. “All lies will be exposed,” Williams told Sharpe.
By mid-year, Kendrick Lamar and Drake were engaged in one of history's most prolific rap beefs. The music industry was further sent through waves as video surfaced showing Diddy assaulting Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel. Diddy was subsequently arrested and charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation for prostitution.
One of the most pivotal stories of the year broke in July, when President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. By the end of the month, Vice President Kamala Harris launched her historic bid for the White House, going on to become the first Black woman to secure a major party's presidential nomination.
Tragedy struck as we continued to seek justice against police brutality amid the killing of Sonya Massey. Along the way, we tragically lost some of the most significant figures in Black culture, including Rich Homie Quan, Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones, and others.
Amid these challenges, Black athletes representing Team USA showed up and showed out at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Their success was hard-earned, as gymnast Jordan Chiles fought to retain the bronze medal she earned in the gymnastics floor final. In basketball, LeBron James and his son, Bronny, made history as the first father-son duo to play in the NBA together.
Beyoncé ended the year with a bang, performing during halftime of Netflix’s first-ever NFL stream.
