Terrace Martin has issued a stern warning to members of Drake’s OVO family who are based in LA, in what appeared to be a response to Drizzy and Kendrick Lamar‘s recent surprise releases.
The California-bred producer took to X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday (May 5).

“Yall in trouble,” he wrote in the since deleted tweet. “To my OVO folks living in LA . Your summer just got hotter . Stay home with air on or move back to the 6 [dog on leash emoji] . With love Terrace .”
The taunt arrived shortly after Kendrick Lamar’s latest diss track, “Not Like Us” — his third surprise release in just as many days.

The track, which was produced by LA staple Mustard, doubled down on the Compton native’s previous claims of the Toronto actor-turned-rapper’s predilection for young children.
“Say Drake, I hear you like ’em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any bitch that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your little sister from him,” he spits.

But he didn’t stop there. In addition to making the diss track art a photo of Drizzy’s home in Toronto — complete with “tags” that imply the residents are registered sex offenders (“Certified lover boy, certified pedophiles“) — K. Dot implied that Drizzy slept with Lil Wayne‘s then girlfriend while the Young Money rapper was locked up on a gun charge in New York.
“Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that’s connivin’ / Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizing,” he spat.

Kendrick Lamar’s unrelenting attacks on Drake have been hailed as a master class in diss tracks.
In the early hours of Friday (May 3), K.Dot amped up the rivalry by dropping “6:16 in LA.” A follow-up to “euphoria” from earlier in the week, the cut alleges that people in Drizzy’s own team are praying on his downfall and even leaking information to his adversaries.

That same evening, the Canadian superstar responded with a seven-plus minute joint packaged with a music video that shows a 1996 Chrysler Town & Country (the same make and model of car displayed on the cover art of good kid, m.A.A.d city‘s deluxe edition) being taken to the junkyard and crushed.
In addition to reprising the “Drop, Drop, Drop” from the “Push Ups” outro, the 6 God takes the war of words to a new place by accusing his rival of domestic violence, insincere racial activism and distancing himself from his native state of California.

He also alleges that Dot nudged 2Pac‘s estate to have his “Taylor Made Freestyle” removed from social-media platforms, among countless other jabs.
