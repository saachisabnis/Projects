Featuring first-time performances of 'Euphoria', 'Not Like Us' and appearances by Dr. Dre, ScHoolboy Q and more
Kendrick Lamar‘s ‘The Pop Out: Ken & Friends’ concert as the Kia Forum in Los Angeles has come to a close after a slew of live debuts and surprises – here’s everything that went down at the show.
Last night (June 19), the rapper took over the Kia Forum in California to celebrate Juneteenth with a special concert, which was live-streamed by Amazon Music on its website and on Twitch. Those streams have ended and cannot be replayed.
During the show – Kendrick’s first since he’s heated rap beef with Drake earlier this year – the rapper kicked off his incendiary set with the live debut of his Drake diss ‘Euphoria’, which featured a deafening singalong from the audience.
The performance also featured a new verse, in which Kendrick called for Drake to return Tupac‘s ring: “Give me Tupac ring back and I might give you a little respect“. The dig comes after Drake seemingly confirmed on Travis Scott’s ‘Meltdown’ that he had purchased one of Tupac’s rings at an auction.

It is also worth noting that for the concert, Kendrick Lamar donned jeans, a white tee and a red hoodie – an outfit similar to what Tupac had worn for a concert in 1994.

Afer ‘Euphoria’, Kendrick Lamar performed hits like ‘DNA.’, ‘ELEMENT.’, ‘Alright’, ‘Swimming Pools’, and more before bringing out Jay Rock to perform the latter’s ‘Money Trees’ and ‘King’s Dead’.
Kendrick then returned to dissing Drake, performing ‘6:16 in LA’ for the first time ever. He followed that up by inviting ScHoolboy Q onstage to perform ‘Collard Greens’ and ‘THat Part’.

After playing a collection of his other career-spanning hits including ‘King Kunta’ and ‘HUMBLE.’, Lamar performed ‘Like That’, the song that reignited the long-dormant rap beef back in March this year.
