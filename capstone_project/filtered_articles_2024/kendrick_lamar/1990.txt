Although the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake may have settled, it continues to inspire new jokes and humorous moments, this time involving Drake's rumored ex-girlfriend, Serena Williams.
At the 2024 ESPY Awards on Thursday night (June 11), the tennis legend and host unexpectedly referenced the Canadian rapper’s high-profile rap dispute with Lamar during her opening monologue. 
Williams stated, “If I’ve learned anything this year, it’s that none of us — not a single one of us, not even me — should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar.”

As Kendrick’s diss track “Not Like Us” played, the Compton native started to Crip Walk before adding, “He will make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits courtside at a Raptors game, they’re gonna Forrest Gump him. Seats taken!”
It's unsurprising that Williams is team K. Dot, especially after an incident in 2022 when Drake mocked her husband, Alexis Ohanian, in his track "Middle of the Ocean" from the album “Her Loss,” calling the Reddit co-founder a “groupie.”
Ohanian later responded on social media, writing: “The reason I stay winning is because I’m relentless about being the best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter.”
Lamar also warned Drake: “better not speak on Serena” on his track “Not Like Us.” Check out Williams’s monologue below.
