Drake’s reps reportedly denies sending Kendrick Lamar a cease and desist to prevent him from performing ‘Not Like Us’ at the 2024 Super Bowl. 
We previously reported that Wack 100 seemingly alleged that Drake was attempting to block Lamar from performing that song. “He’s trying to get the NFL to restrict Kendrick” Wack stated. 
Wack has since clarified his comments, stating he was seemly regurgitating what he’s heard. “I read a f*cking clip,” Wack argued. “I wouldn’t know if Drake sent a cease and desist. Why? Because I don’t represent Kendrick in business or Drake in business so I wouldn’t know if a cease and desist happened. I wouldn’t know. All I did was read a f*cking clip.”

A rep for Drake reportedly told media outlets that the rumors are simply “not true.”
“There was never any intention or plan to send a cease and desist to anyone,” a source claimed.
We previously reported that Lamar shared the news that he will be performing at the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show. “What the deal everybody, my name is Kendrick Lamar,” the video begins. “[And] I’ll be performing at Super Bowl 59. Will you be pulling up?”
He continues: “I hope so. You know it’s only one opportunity to win a championship, right? No round twos. I wouldn’t want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans [on] February 9, 2025. Wear your best dress too, even if you’re watching from home. Let’s go.”
He captioned the post, “Super Bowl LIX. New Orleans. February 2025.#AppleMusicHalftime.”
