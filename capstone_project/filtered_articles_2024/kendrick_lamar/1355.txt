Guest who’s dropping that fire tonight?? 
Kendrick Lamar may have some new music on the way. Rumor has it the third new album is dropping at midnight. Apple Music and Spotify has listed a new project from the Compton rapper simply titled Untitled Unmastered. It is not available for streaming yet and has no titles for the eight tracks listed, but it appears this release is official as producers Cardo and Frank Dukes have made posts on Instagram hyping up the project.
It appears that these tracks may be the untitled creations that Kendrick Lamar has played during appearances on talk shows like The Colbert Report and The Tonight Show with Jimmy
Fallon. Via XXLmag.com
