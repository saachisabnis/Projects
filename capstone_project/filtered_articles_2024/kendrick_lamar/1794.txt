Drake has issued yet another firm warning to his haters, this time while performing on stage during a tour stop in New York.
This week, the OVO boss brought his ‘It’s All a Blur Tour – Big As the What?’ to the UBS Arena in Belmont Park. True to form, Drizzy used his performance to confront his ongoing feud with Kendrick Lamar.

Capitalizing on a performance of “Energy,” with the chorus “I got enemies, got a lot of enemies” — on repeat, Drake exclaimed, “Fuck these n-ggas,” referencing “rap guys” targeting him.
Watch a clip of the performance below.
Drake’s fiery delivery closely follows a string of statements that may or may not be responses to Kendrick Lamar‘s verse on Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That.”
The Hip Hop world has been ablaze since Lamar’s scathing diss of Drake and J. Cole on that track, released earlier this month. However, Drizzy has seemingly remained unfazed by the uproar.

Sharing various pictures of himself enjoying life on Instagram, on Thursday (March 28), the 6 God wrote in the caption: “They’d rather go to war with me than admit they are their own worst enemy.”
Though he avoids naming names, the message appears to squarely address his intensifying conflict with both Kendrick and Future.

The very next day, Drake, returning to IG, posted a different photo dump, with a caption that many observers thought was aimed at Future and Metro.
“I could never sell ya’ll out to sell my latest work,” Drake wrote. “Never do you bad out the blue but I’m down to make it worse.”

Kendrick clearly dissed Drake on his guest verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That”.
K Dot references Drake and Cole’s number one hit “First Person Shooter”: “Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches,” he raps.

Kendrick Lamar then directly references “the big three” — himself, Drake and J. Cole — claiming it’s only him at the top of the rap chain.
“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me,” he spits.

Kendrick also mentions Drake’s album For All The Dogs: “N-gga, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary.”
