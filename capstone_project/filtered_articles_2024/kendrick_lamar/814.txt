J. Cole surprised fans and dropped a new single titled “Port Antonio.” On the track and addressed Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s infamous beef.
On the track Cole raps, “I pulled the plug because I seen where that was about to go, they wanted blood, they wanted clicks to make they pockets grow” he began. 
The verse continued: “I wouldn’t have lost the battle, dog, I would’ve lost a bro, I would’ve gained a foe, and all for what?/ Jermaine is no king, if that means I gotta dig up dirt and pay the whole team of algorithm bot n*****s just to sway the whole thing on social media, competing for ya favorable memes”
Elsewhere in the song directly addressed Drake. “Hey Drake, you’ll always be my n***a/ I ain’t ashamed to say you did a lot for me, my n***a.” 
Drake seemingly reacted to the lyrics as he “liked” J. Cole’s post on Instagram.

Cole previously apologized for dissing Kendrick Lamar in his track “7 Minute Drill.”
“…Man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did. In my fucking life’ right?” said Cole about making the track. “And, I know, this is not what a lot of people want to hear… I can hear my n***as up there right now like… ‘Nahhh, don’t do that.’ But, I gotta keep it 100 with y’all. I damn near had a relapse, right? Because, y’all heard some shit that happened two-three weeks ago, however long it was… y’all heard that bazooka that was dropped.”
He continued: “I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, bruh I know I don’t really feel a way. But the world wanna see blood… so I say all of that to say, in my spirit of trying to get this music out, I moved in a way that spiritually feels bad on me. I tried to jab my n***a back and I tried to keep it friendly. But at the end of the day, when I listen to it and when it comes out and I see the talk, that sh*t don’t sit right with my spirit.”
