Mustard may have stormed his way back onto the charts and radio airwaves thanks to Kendrick Lamar‘s “Not Like Us,” but he isn’t precious over people meddling with his production — especially when it concerns a fellow West Coast producer.
Legendary L.A. beatmaker Battlecat earned a thumbs up from the “Ballin'” hitmaker after he shared a mash-up of K. Dot’s hit Drake diss that somehow makes the West Coast bop even more, well, West Coast.

The remix, produced by Amorphous and played by Soulection co-founder Joe Kay during a recent DJ set, blends K. Dot’s bruising bars with the funky beat from Kurupt‘s 1998 hit “We Can Freak It,” which was produced by Battlecat.
While reposting the clip on Instagram, Battlecat wrote in his caption: “BANG THE ‼️ CLASSICS WIT A NEW CLASSIC & THIS HAPPENS.”

Mustard, who made the original hyphy-flavored, club-friendly beat for “Not Like Us,” commented on the post with several fire emojis.
Fellow producer Rockwilder also co-signed the remix, writing: “That was a bop right there king! That would have given me chills!!”
“Not Like Us” has made a tremendous impact since its release earlier this month, not only dealing a devastating blow to Drake but making a huge splash commercially.
Last week, the song debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, earning Kendrick Lamar his fourth No. 1 hit and second as a lead artist (following 2017’s “HUMBLE.”).

Rubbing salt into the 6 God’s wound, the track has also broken several records previously held by Kendrick’s bitter rival.
It recently became the fastest song in history to surpass 100 million streams on Spotify, eclipsing Drake’s 2018 hit “God’s Plan.”

More importantly, “Not Like Us,” in the eyes of many Hip Hop fans and figures, secured victory for Kendrick in his hotly contested feud with Drizzy.
Following the song’s release, which came hot on the heels of his previous diss song “Meet the Grahams,”Cam’ron and Ma$e both crowned the Compton native the winner of the beef.

“It seemed like whatever he started out doing, he picked up the speed — pause — and really did what he was supposed to do,” the latter said on their sports show It Is What It Is.
“I thought the last record that he did [‘Not Like Us’] was the one […] That was crazy. When I heard that, I was like, ‘Oh yeah, it’s gonna be tough.’ That was the one I was expecting.”

Joe Budden echoed that sentiment on his self-titled podcast, saying: “I think he won this off skill. He was much better than Drake the whole way.”
Drake responded to “Not Like Us” with the largely defensive “The Heart Part 6” before appearing to back out of the battle.
