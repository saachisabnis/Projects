Kendrick Lamar surprised fans by dropping his new album “GNX,” featuring 12 new songs.
The album is executive-produced by Jack Antonoff and includes multiple SZA features.
Lamar had been teasing new music for months, but now fans can enjoy his latest release.
The album is a victory lap for Lamar after a successful year and will likely add to his upcoming Super Bowl halftime show performance.
Recently, Kendrick Lamar addressed the internet debate over Kendrick being chosen as the Super Bowl performer over Lil Wayne.
Kendrick rapped on “Wacced Out Murals,” “I used to bump ‘Tha Carter III,’ I held my Rollie chain proud/The irony I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down.”
He continued, “Whatever though, call me crazy, everybody questionable/Turn em to an Eskimo/I drew the line and decimal.”
He added, “Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me, all these n*ggas agitated/I’m just glad they showing they faces.”
