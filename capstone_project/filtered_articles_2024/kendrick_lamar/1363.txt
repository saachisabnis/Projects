Terry Crews has experienced a lot over the years, but something he’ll never forget is making a prediction about Kendrick Lamar that came true.
Crews appeared on the latest episode of Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast, and mentioned meeting K. Dot at an awards show around the time of his 2011 project Section .80.

“We were at the BET Awards and I saw this little kid walking around with a little hat on,” Crews began. “I was like, ‘Hey, I got his mixtape.’ … He’s like, ‘You know who I am?’ It’s Kendrick Lamar.
“I said, ‘Man, your mixtape Section .80  is amazing. You are the next.’ I said, ‘Rebecca [King-Crews, his wife], this is Kendrick.’ He was like, ‘You know who I am?’ I said, ‘I love you. I think you are going to be the future.’”
You can see Crews’ recollection below.
That initial meeting was not the end of the story.
“What’s so crazy is he called me a few years later [and] I ended up doing a video with him,” the actor continued. “He said, ‘Remember when you told me you knew who I was, and remember you told me I was going to be doing something great?’”

“Tell me he’s not the best in the world right now, and I’m so proud,” Crews concluded.
Not all of Crews’ experiences with rappers have been as positive as those with Kendrick. Back in 2020, the athlete-turned-actor had a run-in with Rick Ross.

Crews was in the news at the time for his stance on the Black Lives Matter Movement, saying it could lead to a state of “Black supremacy”; and for an attempt to reclaim the word “coon” by using the acronym Conquer Our Own Negativity.
