Who is ready for new music from SZA? I think I can say it's everyone, but the singer announced that 'Lana' deluxe would be coming this Friday, December 20.
The Love Galore singer made the announcement with a video trailer on social media starring Ben Stiller. The post was captioned "Deluxe Friday" She then posted another clip with Ben Stiller with the caption, "SEVVEREANCE SEASON TWO OUR JANUARY 17."
After the recent announcement of her stadium tour with Kendrick Lamar in 2025, many were excited to expect new music to be coming soon from the singer. Now, we are anticipating the deluxe drop right before the end of the year.
Lana has been in the works for the last two years, and the singer has teased many things about the album over the years. In a recent interview with British Vogue, she referenced her new music and the season that she is in. “I’m not identifying with my brokenness. It’s not my identity. It’s shit that happened to me. Yeah, I experienced cruelty. I have to put it down at some point. Piece by piece, my music is shifting because of that, the lighter I get.”
SZA and Kendrick Lamar will kick off the Grand National Tour in April 2025 with the perfect amount of time for fans to learn the new lyrics to both of their latest projects. Lamar recently released his new album, GNX, just a month ago.
