Ab-Soul has responded to the shoutout he received from Kendrick Lamar on “The Heart Pt. 6.”
On the GNX track, which samples SWV‘s “Use Your Heart,” Kendrick rapped: “Ab-Soul in the corner mumblin’ raps, fumblin’ packs of Black & Milds / Crumblin’ kush ’til he cracked a smile / His words legendary, wishin’ I could rhyme like him / Studied his style to define my pen.”

Speaking on Instagram Live over the weekend, Kendrick’s Black Hippy brother reciprocated the love and praised the Compton native for teaching him a thing or two as an artist.
He said: “I’m very honored, that’s my brother in real life. I’d take a bullet for cuz. Aside from that, I guarantee you he didn’t study me as much as I studied him.

“He taught me the most as a professional recording artist. I just wanna make that very clear. We really slept on the floor for this shit, all of us. Dot, [Jay] Rock, [ScHoolboy] Q, Sounwave.”
Soulo also declared: “I am the B.O.A.T. I am the best rapper. Ask anyone. I say that humbly, it’s not from a place of arrogance. I really do this.”

“The Heart Pt. 6” also saw Kendrick Lamar take responsibility for why a full Black Hippy album was never released.
On the last verse, he acknowledged that the group never put out a full-length project because he was too focused on other endeavors.

“I jog my memory, knowin’ Black Hippy didn’t work ’cause of me / Creatively, I moved on with new concepts in reach / Top, remember all them sessions we would strategize / To hit the streets, then come back, record three records?” he spit.
Back in April, ScHoolboy Q appeared on an episode of The Danny Brown Show and was asked about the prospect of reuniting with his Black Hippy compatriots.

“I’m not making no Black Hippy shit,” he responded. “Hell no. I’ll never do that shit.”
When Danny Brown pressed, asking if he would consider doing it “for the culture,” Q snapped back: “Fuck the culture. Ain’t no culture. What is the culture? What is rap culture? What is the fucking rap culture?”

On a more serious note, he continued: “I think we’re all kind of on our separate paths right now. Dot is doing his own thing with pgLang. I’m doing my own thing, curating a new artist. I did that part already, I gotta have this second part ’cause I got like 18 more albums to make.
“So it’s like, I’m tryna figure out this phase before I get to the third phase. And Ab-Soul, he’s working, Jay Rock‘s working. I just don’t see where we’ll ever have time to.”
