Kendrick Lamar has shared a video for Squabble Up.
The track features on the Compton rapper's new album, 'GNX', which he surprise-released last Friday (November 22).
The clip, meanwhile, was directed by Calmatic and finds Lamar reading a book called How to Be More Like Kendrick for Dummies, among several nods to Los Angeles hip hop history.
'GNX' serves as the follow-up to Lamar's 2022 album 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers'. It features guest contributions from SZA, Jack Antonoff, Sounwave, Mustard, Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, Lefty Gunplay, Dody6 and more.
Lamar will headline the 2025 Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show in New Orleans on February 9. The event will take place a week after the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, which sees the artist dominating the rap categories with seven nominations, including Record and Song of the Year for Not Like Us.
