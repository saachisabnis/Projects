(1) BUTLER CONFERENCE AT HUNTINGTON THIS MONTH. The Huntington Library in Pasadena, CA will host a two-day conference, “Futurity as Praxis: Learning from Octavia E. Butler” on May 23-24.
The year 2024 marks the beginning of the critical dystopian future Octavia E. Butler (1947–2006) envisioned in her groundbreaking novel Parable of the Sower. Her fiction and the story of her life compel us to reckon with power, leadership, creativity, the Earth, human relationships, and the unknown possibilities that await us in the stars. Now, intellectuals from different communities will gather to contemplate her legacy. This conference asks how we have learned from Butler’s writing and what her archive at The Huntington—a short distance from where the author spent her formative years in Pasadena, California—can help future generations discover.
One of the panels will feature well-known sff creators.
Session 1: Creativity as Praxis
Tickets for the two-day conference are available here. General: $25 (Students free). Optional lunch: $20 (each day)
(2) ROMAN AROUND. “’Megalopolis’: New Teaser Trailer Drops Ahead of Cannes Premiere” reports Deadline.
Ahead of its world premiere here at Cannes, Francis Ford Coppola has dropped a teaser trailer for his master epic Meglopolis. While the first trailer showed Adam Driver’s ambitious architectural idealist Cesar attempting suicide atop a skyscraper, yet stopping time, here we see a montage of the pic’s action: a devastated city indulged in neon and noir infused Bacchanal.
Coppola’s latest is billed as a Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America. The City of New Rome must change, causing conflict between Cesar Catilina (Driver), a genius artist who seeks to leap into a utopian, idealistic future, and his opposition, Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), who remains committed to a regressive status quo, perpetuating greed, special interests, and partisan warfare.  Torn between them is socialite Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), the mayor’s daughter, whose love for Cesar has divided her loyalties, forcing her to discover what she truly believes humanity deserves.
(3) FROM SOUP TO NUTS. The Guardian has a long feature on the history of Coppola’s efforts to make this film: “’Has this guy ever made a movie before?’ Francis Ford Coppola’s 40-year battle to film Megalopolis”.
Early reactions to Megalopolis have been mixed. After a private screening in Los Angeles last month, one executive described it as “batshit crazy”….
…Others, however, were fulsome in their praise. “I feel I was a part of history. Megalopolis is a brilliant, visionary masterpiece,” said the director Gregory Nava after the screening. “I was so overwhelmed that I couldn’t do anything for the rest of the day.” An anonymous viewer at a London screening went even further: “This film is like Einstein and relativity in 1905, Picasso and Guernica in 1937 – it’s a date in the history of cinema.”…
(4) CAROL SHIELDS PRIZE. The 2024 Carol Shields Prize for Fiction, which provides $150,000USD to the winner, is the largest English-language literary prize in the world for women and non-binary authors. So the announcement of the winner may be of interest to you even if the book is not genre.
V. V. Ganeshananthan has been named the winner for her novel Brotherless Night, published by Random House.
(5) COMPUSERVE GETS A PLAQUE. It didn’t take as long as you might have expected for one of the building blocks of personal computing to earn its own historic marker. Alex Krislov shared a photo of Ohio’s salute to CompuServe.
(6) LATEST ITERATION OF FANHISTORIC CLIFTON’S. Boing Boing says “Legendary L.A. eatery Clifton’s Cafeteria is back! (but is called Clifton’s Republic now)”.
…To say Clifton’s is kitschy doesn’t begin to capture it. It’s more like if uber-kitschy, ur-kitschy and mondo-kitschy had a baby….
We’re interested because LASFS used to meet at Clifton’s in the late 1930s. And consequently, Discover Los Angeles’ article “Clifton’s Republic: The Story of an LA Icon” has the tidbit of greatest interest to fans:
…The third floor is home to the Gothic Bar, which features a booth named after sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury, a patron of the original Clifton’s who became a pal of Meieran’s. The back bar is a repurposed 19th-century gothic altar. The third floor also features Clinton Hall, a live performance and private event space, and lots of taxidermy dioramas created in consultation with experts from the Natural History Museum….
(7) HE’S ON THE COVER. Fantasy author Lev Grossman in on the front of Publishers Weekly.
(8) DON’T REIGN ON THEIR PARADE. Scavenger’s Reign may get a second chance on another platform. “Netflix Just Saved 2023’s Most Underrated Sci-Fi Show From Cancelation” reports Inverse:
Scavengers Reign, the remarkable but underseen sci-fi series that premiered on Max in late 2023. Scavengers Reign was widely regarded as one of the year’s best shows, and one of many projects that heralded a golden age for indie animation. Unfortunately, the series was canceled on May 10… but that development has a silver lining.
Per Variety, Scavengers Reign will remain on Max (a rare concession for WB’s canceled shows), but its first season will also stream on Netflix. The rival streamer is reportedly interested in picking up the show for more seasons, but continuation is contingent on Scavengers’ success on the platform.
… Given Netflix’s growing interest in adult animation, the streamer might be an ideal destination. Scavengers Reign follows the crew of a deep space freighter after they crash on a hostile alien planet. Across 12 episodes, the crew works to find their way back to their ship, and survive a world trying to annihilate them. The series doesn’t shy away from dark themes, so it should feel at home alongside Netflix originals like Blue Eyed Samurai….

(10) TODAY’S BIRTHDAY.
[Written by Cat Eldridge.]
Born May 14, 1944 — George Lucas, 80. I can say without doubt George Lucas was a director whose first work I encountered was THX 1138. What a damn strange film that is. Upon rewatching it twenty or so years later, the Suck Fairy wasn’t pleased by it as I’ll say she holds that it just feels really dated now which I agree with her. 
Ahhh but then was Star Wars, and no I won’t accept the renaming it. Simply didn’t happen. The film itself which I’ve seen at the theater and watched a number of times since is extraordinary. That it garnered a Hugo at IguanaCon II shouldn’t surprise anyone here. 
Confession time. I’ve not watched any of Star Wars films past the first three. I adore The Empire Strikes Back, a Hugo winner at Denvention Two, actually my favorite of the first three films. I don’t dislike the final film, Return of the Jedi, Hugo of course, this time at L.A. Con II, but I really do think the story is better in The Empire Strikes Back. Also, Lucas gave his screenwriting credit to Leigh Brackett for that film after her death from cancer.
So, what’s my next film that he did that I really like? Oh guess. It was when he was story writer and executive producer on the first four Indiana Jones films, which his colleague and good friend Steven Spielberg directed, so it is Raiders of The Lost Ark is my favorite film here (with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom being almost as good), and the last should been not have been done. So not surprisingly Raiders of The Lost Ark would win him and Spielberg a Hugo, this time at Chicon IV.
Need I say that The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles was wonderful? Yes, it stretched probability to the breaking point and way beyond continuously in terms of who young Indy met, but that was the sheer fun of the series. No Hugo nomination, why, oh why?
Did you know he wrote the story for Willow? (Not the screenplay.) Well, he did. Cool. I mean really cool. Noreascon 3 nominated it for a Hugo but a rabbit from Toon Town won that year. Speaking of really cool films, he was executive producer and co-edited Labyrinth with director Jim Henson. Yes, you nominated it for a Hugo, this time at Conspiracy ’87. 
He produced Howard the Duck, which the French had the gall to name on the one-sheets Howard Une nouvelle race de héros (Howard: A New Breed of Hero) was considered his worst film by far. It’s not a film I like but I feel that it should be noted here. No, you did not nominate Howard Une nouvelle race de héros for a Hugo. Nor did French give it any Awards either.
Finally for me, he also was the creator and executive producer of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series which premiered with a feature film of the same name that aired just before its first episode. 
I know he’s done a lot more including some new material now on Disney+ but I’m not taking that streaming service now. At some point, I’ll gorge myself over there but not yet. 
(11) COMICS SECTION.
(12) SPEAKING OF GEORGE. “’Grow up. These are my movies, not yours’: George Lucas Won’t be Happy How Star Wars Fan Group is Illegally Saving the Original Trilogy” Fandomwire says confidently.
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away began George Lucas’ epic space opera tale that eventually grew into the pop culture phenomenon we know today as Star Wars. The original trilogy of films Lucas made during the 70s and 80s, became beloved across the globe, but the theatrical cuts of the movies have neared the brink of extinction following Lucas’ special edition re-releases.
As a result, a group of rebel Star Wars fans have taken it upon themselves to not only preserve but also digitally restore the original cuts so that the fanbase can enjoy the version of the films they first fell in love with. However, the group’s activities directly clash with Lucas’ vision for his franchise and border on a legal grey area. Here is why George Lucas won’t be happy with the rebel fans trying to preserve the original cuts of the original trilogy.
The original trilogy of Star Wars films, spearheaded by George Lucas were critical and commercial successes. However, in 1997 Lucas released the “Special Edition” of the films for the trilogy’s 20th anniversary, which featured extensive changes to the original theatrical cuts.
The original cuts have since become scarce. However, a group of Star Wars fans, known as Team Negative One have reportedly almost completely digitally restored the original cuts in 4K using 35-millimeter prints of the original trilogy….
To show how serious Lucas is about his later cuts —
…Similarly, when the National Film Registry aimed to preserve 1977’s Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope), Lucas reportedly refused to provide them with a copy of the original theatrical release…
(13) Q&A ABOUT FUNDRAISING ANTHOLOGY. Broken Olive Branches is a charity anthology; over 30 authors in the horror community donated stories to help the civilians of Palestine. The proceeds from the anthology go to ANERA and the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund. Roseanna interviews the editor and some of the authors involved in “Roundtable Interview: Broken Olive Branches” at Nerds of a Feather.
(14) WHERE’S THE BEEF? AI raises the dead: “It was a classic rap beef. Then Drake revived Tupac with AI and Congress got involved” on NPR’s “Planet Money”.
In late April, Senator Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) began his testimony before a Senate subcommittee hearing by doing something unusual for a stuffy institution like Congress: He played a new song from the rapper Drake.
But it wasn’t Drake’s rap verse that Tillis felt was important for Congress to hear. Rather it was a verse in the song featuring the voice of the legendary — and long dead — rapper Tupac Shakur.
In a kind of uniquely modern sorcery, the song uses artificial intelligence to resurrect Tupac from the dead and manufacture a completely new — and synthetic — verse delivered in the late rapper’s voice. The song, titled “Taylor Made Freestyle,” is one in a barrage of brutal diss tracks exchanged between Drake and Kendrick Lamar in a chart-topping rap battle. Kendrick is from California, where Tupac is like a god among rap fans, so weaponizing the West Coast rap legend’s voice in the feud had some strategic value for Drake, who is from Toronto.
Drake, apparently, thought it’d be okay to use Tupac’s synthetic voice in his song without asking permission from the late rapper’s estate. But, soon after the song’s release, Tupac’s estate sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding that Drake take the song down, which he did. However — given the murky legal landscape regulating AI creations — it’s unclear whether Tupac’s estate actually has the law on their side.
And so the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has become not only one of the most brilliant — and most vicious — battles in the history of rap. It’s also become a historic flashpoint for the issues posed by what you might call AI necromancy — resurrecting traits of the dead using AI technology.
We’ve entered a new world where anyone can conjure the voice or visual likeness of a dead celebrity — or really anyone, dead or alive — with a few clicks using AI software.

(16) ALIEN EMBASSIES. [Item by SF Concatenation’s Jonathan Cowie.] It was the monthly  ‘Sci-Fi Sunday’ over at Science & Futurism with Isaac Arthur with a look at the SF trope of alien embassies.
Because it was a Sci-Fi Sunday episode, Isaac assumed some sort of FTL travel but not instantaneous communication. He takes a (he himself says) simple assumption of all civilizations arising together and expanding their sphere of influence, which in 3-dimensions would give each 12 neighbors.
With regards to SF, he draws mainly on cinema and TV looking at embassies Babylon V, Star Trek and Stargate.  However Niven and Pournelle’s A Mote in God’s Eye,  and Dune do get a look in.
He also points to flaws in many SF shows’ plot arising out of mis-understandings making a fairly plausible case against such actually taking place.He opines that the embassy would be in space for control biological contaminants (both ways) and here, it is bacteria rather than viruses are the major problem. He also notes that assuming an advanced planetary system might be colonized out to the equivalent of it Kuiper belt, such is the distance between stars that any traveler passing through a stellar empire would likely come no closer than many thousands of times the Kuiper orbit distance to a single star’s civilization and so no need or practicality to control travelers simply passing through.
“We often imagine encountering many alien civilizations, and establishing trade and relationships with them, but what would being an alien ambassador be like?”

12) The reason that I purchased the DVD set I have of the original trilogy was because it also included the original versions of those films.  Not sure I’ve ever watched those DVDs, but it’s reassuring that I can still see the original films, if I want to.
(12) George is missing the point here: the fans enjoy the originals, and it was the originals that were going into the archives, not his retconned versions.
16) Just wanted to mention in passing Keith Laumer’s Retief stories, which usually took place in and around embassies:
“Let me add my congratulations, Retief,” he said. “That was fast thinking.”
“Are you out of your mind, Magnan?” the Ambassador barked. “I am extremely displeased.”
“Why,” Magnan stuttered, “I was speaking sarcastically, of course, Mr. Ambassador. Naturally I, too, was taken aback by his presumption.”
(2) Interesting.
Birthday: sigh I like the first three. On the other hand, I liked the re-edit of Star Wars – seeing Han “accidentally” stomp on Jabba’s tail worked for me. Of the rest? Episode III is the one I was waiting for, let’s forget I and II. And then final? Only the last worked for me. Blowing up Trantor, um, sorry, whatsit from parsecs away? Nope.
Indy: as far as I’m concerned, there were only about a dozen minutes of Temple that were worth it – the beginning, where you see as the scum everyone takes Indy for in Raiders, and the scene where nothing happens – where he sits outside of town all afternoon, and you see him change, to the Indy of Raiders. Otherwise, if Raiders was all the things that made the old serials good, Temple was everything that made them bad.
And, hell, yes, The Young Indian Jones should have gotten awards.
(12) The first movie, in 1977, was Star Wars.</em Not Episode IV:A New Hope. I saw it in May1977, after having seen the trailers as part of Boston’s First Night celebration.
Among other gripes–Han shot first. And that’s no minor point. Han shooting first in the cantina was critical to Han’s character arc over the course of the film, and the course of the trilogy. You can’t make him an ethical, moral man from the beginning, and still have the movies we loved.
No matter how George Lucas feels about it.
The best George Lucas movie, by far, is the non-genre American Graffiti.  If not for The Sting, it very well could have won the Oscar in 1974.
Title credit!  And however I may feel about the changes he’s made over the years, or his more recent work, it’s unquestionably true that without Star Wars I wouldn’t be who I am today.  (Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is left as an exercise for the reader.)
Birthday: I still enjoy THX 1138, but it has “I’m fresh out of film school and want the critics to think I’m a genius” all over it.
(12) It’s unmistakably clear that the Star Wars we all fell in love with was not the movie that Lucas intended to make, and as soon as he got the chance he went back and “fixed” it. And then couldn’t understand why everyone was angry.
Still doesn’t understand, apparently.
@Lis Carey: Han shot first is critical not only to his character arc, but also to the scene in question, which doesn’t work without it.
8) Scavengers Reign is a damned good show and I really hope it gets continued.
(12) I’m going to be contrary. Fans aren’t wrong to prefer the theatrical release of Star Wars et seq., but neither is Lucas wrong to prefer his version. I know that director’s cuts usually exist as alternatives, not replacements, but do this type of complaint appear in other areas? Do Tolkien readers complain about the (I presume) inability to buy the first edition text in bookstores, instead of the revised version? Are there people outraged by fixups which have supplanted the original short stories?
(Maybe there are, and it’s only the relative size of SW which makes this instance of the complaints more visible?)
12) Also there’s an amount of professional jealousy involving the success of Star Wars. Marcia Lucas was the primary Editor of the classic version that made George rich and famous. After they divorced George HAD to show how it was all him and so put his fingerprints/edit-scissors on everything
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Lucas
Lis is right about “Han shot First” as well.
(10) I saw “Howard the Duck* in a movie theater; “Star Wars” I saw at a drive-in (my mother said “It’s just a Western” afterwards).
I concur on Han shooting first. It’s essential for his character arc.
@Ken Finlayson–Yes, directors’ cuts usually exist as alternatives.
Lucas is attempting to erase the existence of the theatrical release–which he doesn’t appear to have had a problem with, till after the divorce.
Tolkien made an appeal to the readers to back the Ballantine edition, because the Ace edition was the result of Ace exploiting a mistake by his UK publisher that killed the US copyright. That appeal was effective; the fans wanted him to benefit from the success of his work, too.
And his edits didn’t fundamentally change critical parts of the narrative, either.
Fix-ups rarely change the stories themselves in any significant way.And if any of the stories were ever published in anthologies, there’s no attempt to get them pulled from any subsequent editions.
Lucas, because of professional jealousy of his ex-wife’s role in making it the success it was, wants to erase the theatrical release from existence, and from the memories of the fans who saw it.
11)  I share the enthusiasm of this tribute for George and his work.
12)  …but that doesn’t mean that he is incapable of being wrong everyone once in a while.
Regards,
Dann
Why should freedom of speech and freedom of the press be allowed? Why should a government which is doing what it believes to be right allow itself to be criticized? It would not allow opposition by lethal weapons. Ideas are much more fatal things than guns. Why should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious opinions calculated to embarrass the government? – Nikolai Lenin
Personally, I’m looking forward to the original version of The Hobbit going into the public domain (at least in the US) in 2033.  Not because I think it’s superior to the updated version, but because it will then be easily available to fans (thanks to free book digitization projects) who can then compare it with the better-known version, and more easily imagine alternative ways the world could have developed.  And the later version that has compatible continuity with The Lord of the Rings will continue to be available (and I’d imagine will remain the version usually read).
In contrast, it does disturb me that by the time Star Wars reaches the US public domain in 2073, there may well be no surviving copies of the original release that fans fell in love with in 1977, outside of “pirate” restoration projects.  (As far as I know, all DVD and VHS versions are from later releases; some show versions prior to Lucas’s more pronounced “special edition” tinkering, but all the ones I know of have some degree of post-release tinkering, such as the addition of “Episode IV: A New Hope” to the opening title sequence, or subtler change to some of the special effects.)
(10) I can blame George Lucas for my science fiction movie magazine habit. 🙂 Imagine going to the magazine stand and finding out there are magazines for sale with cover stories about that mysterious Darth Vader guy. (Back then, the world was so new that many of us thought “Darth” was his first name.) Those magazines also taught me about other movies — and even lead me to read Dune.
(12) To a point, I can understand why he’d be upset — they are his movies. But I can also understand why fans want to preserve the original. (Han shot first.) My co-worker said her first reaction after seeing the remastered version was something like, “What the crap is this stuff?” There were little robots and aliens and what-not added.
The original version should be available legally for fans who want it. (Yes, even if your ex-wife was the editor.) Then, it wouldn’t be an issue.
Yeah, I had thought Darth Vader was related to Spacen Vader. I don’t remember Han shooting at all–little more than the trash compactor and the music.
(10) “I’ve not watched any of Star Wars films past the first three.”  Don’t write them all off.  Rogue One is a good movie, and feeds directly into the 1977 film.
“No Hugo nomination [for Young Indiana Jones Chronicles], why, oh why?”
Because it was neither SF nor Fantasy?
“Spacen Vader” — I like that.
May 14, 1973 — the last Saturn V launch, carrying Skylab.
Is there any source to support this idea that George wants to withhold the original version out of jealousy? The Wiki article that Jeff Warner linked doesn’t seem to support that. In fact, it says her main contribution was editing the Battle Of Yavin sequence which, so far as I remember, remains pretty much the same in the later cut, with the exception of better pyro for the Death Star destruction.
(12) A more accurate account of the <Lord of the Rings copyright controversy. Not majorly different, but corrects some details that may matter to picky minds like mine.
Lord of the Rings copyright controversy
(12) I’ve seen a beta release of the group’s 35mm scans. It was a real kick seeing “Star Wars” scroll at the front, with no episode number or subtitle attached
@Cliff
It’s complicated. It’s well documented that the original Star Wars was saved in the editing room by his wife, who he later had a massive falling out with. And that while he was very happy with it, it wasn’t quite the cut he would have gone with if there’d been better options.
There’s also some credible reports that the Star Wars masters have not aged well. You can look up “vinegar syndrome” and red film syndrome for more details. But the short version is that a lot of professional prints from that era have deteriorated badly. Part of the remaster push was to preserve a new “master” copy, and the restoration techniques available in the 1990s pale in comparison to current ones. It’s very possible there really is no surviving studio master of the original cuts
So you’ve got a situation where Lucas never loved the original edit, and then got a situation where due to the technology at the time they basically had to recut it anyways. Now, it’s not the choices they would make now, but walking it back would mean walking back a lot of public statements and choices that made perfect sense at the time. Much easier to dig in his heels
The version I heard is that the Lucas’ divorce agreement gives her a share of royalties/residuals from the original movie, and the Special Edition was made to displace those royalties/residuals, and minimize the amount of money she gets.  Supposedly this story is taught (anecdotally, at least) in law schools.
