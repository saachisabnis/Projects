In Kendrick Lamar's first song since his Drake diss track 'Not Like Us', he expresses his frustration with the current state of the hip-hop industry.
Kendrick Lamar has shocked fans by releasing a brand-new song titled Watch The Party Die, in his first release since immense Drake diss track Not Like Us. 
The 'Humble' rapper dropped the song at the exact moment the 2024 VMAs started airing, and with the themes of the new song including critiquing commercial artists, it is no surprise with him choosing this release date and time.
Fans have spotted that the song cover is an eBay listing showing some pre-owned Nike trainers, but what is the meaning behind Watch the Party Die and what are the lyrics to the new track? Here's everything you need to know.  
Kendrick does not hold back in this new song, however he appears to diss some unknown targets, unlike his full-throttle diss against Drake in Not Like Us. 
Much of the song shows Kendrick to appear frustrated at the state of hip-hop and the music industry as a whole. 
He specifically critiques what commercial artists like Drake represent, including materialsim and what 'success' appears to be. 
I think it's time to watch the party die
This sh*t done got too wicked to apologize
It's different, get him whacked and disqualified
We even kill the killers 'cause they like taking innocent lives
Burn a whole village, we start over, it's really that time
Why reason with these n****s if they can't see the future first?
Why argue with these clowns if the circus is well at work?
Just walk that man down, that'll do everyone a solid
It's love, but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence
If you parade in gluttony without givin' truth to the youth
The graveyard is company, just tell us what casket to choose
They party more than b*tches, tell me, what are you working for?
They glorify scamming, you get chipped over this credit card
Influencers talked down 'cause I'm not with the basic sh*t
But they don't hate me, they hate the man that I represent
The type of man that never d*ckride 'cause I want a favor
The man that resides in patience, so where the soldiers at?
The one's that lost it all and learnt to learn from that
A thirst for life, head inside a book 'cause he concerned with that
Information that'll change his life because he yearns for that
Dedication, findin' out what's right 'cause he can earn from that
I feel for the women that deal with the clown and nerd sh*t
Can't blame them, today they ain't really got much to work with
How many b*tches harder than a lot of you n****s?
Would trade all of y'all for Nip, I can't be proud of you n****s
[Chorus]
God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace
Dear God, please keep these lame n****s away from me
Dear God, keep me shinin', the f*ck do they really think?
Pocket-watching, you must be the police
God, bless these words, dear God, bless how I think
Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me
Dear God, please forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried

I think it's time for me to watch the party die (Uh-huh, huh)
Get 'em gone, we gon' watch the party die (Uh-huh)
Send 'em home, we gon' watch the party die
[Verse 2]
I think it's time to watch the party die
Street n****s and the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies
I need they families mortified
We can do life without 'em, get they bodies organized, tell me if you obliged
No more pillow-talkin', jump-startin' neighborhood wars
Dirty-mackin' b*tches because your spirit is insecure
The flashy n****a with nasty decisions usin' money as a backbone
I want his head cracked before he's back home
The radio personality pushin' propaganda for salary
Let me know when they turn up as a casualty, I want agony
Assault and battery, I see a new Earth
Filled with beautiful people makin' humanity work
Let's kill the followers that follow up on poppin' mollies from
The obvious, degenerates, that's failing to acknowledge the
Hope that we tryna spread, if I'm not his vote
Then you need to bring his f*cking head, I’ll film that sh*t in hi-res
[Chorus]
God, give me life, dear God, please give me peace
Dear God, please keep these lame n****s away from me
Dear God, keep me shinin', the f*ck do they really think?
Pocket-watching, you must be the police
God bless these words, dear God, bless how I think
Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse 'em with me
Dear God, please, forgive me, you knowin' how hard I tried
I think it's time for me to watch the party die
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do
F*ck these n****s up or show 'em just what prayer do?
I want to be empathetic, my heart like Dee-1
But I would—
It's time to get these devils out the way, heavy metals on my sword
We settle hard disputes today, the ghetto Hollywood divorce
Say hello to your future fate, the culture bred with carnivores
You let 'em snack, they eat your face, the signatures is bein' forged
They wonder why I'm not enthused to drop
The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried
It's cynical to say I know these artists petrified
The end result in jail by Jezebel or drugged up full of lies
Critical, I know my physical is tested all the time
I'm pitiful, sunken place soon as I'm questionin' my pride
I'm seein' ghosts, blackin' out, relapsin' one thought at the time
I spare no feelings that ain't mine, I'm in my feelings when I slide, I mean
A n***a wonder what Lecrae would do
Terrace Martin said I'm mentally with layers, true
I flood the market with my best regards, I paid your dues
And so it's up, if you ain't one of ours, it's bad news
My n***a Jay Estrada said I gotta burn it down to build it up
That confirmation real as f*ck, it ain't too many real as us
Lockin' in to what I trust, lookin' outside
The kids live tomorrow 'cause today, the party just died
