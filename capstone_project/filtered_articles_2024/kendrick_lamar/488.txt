The article has amassed thousands of views since published. Landon Buford is best known for his exclusive interview with Zyir Brown, the former bodyguard of Tory Lanez, who claimed he never witness Lanez assault women. 
The news of Lamar’s alleged plan comes after Akademiks reported that the Pulitizer Prize winner will be releasing new music soon. According to Akademiks, the information is valid because he is “the greatest journalist in the world.”
Responding to DJ Hed’s dismissal of his access to unbeknownst information, Akademiks said, “I’m the greatest single journalist you’ve ever heard of. I built a $20 million industry by doing this sh*t. I played Drake’s video and Drake had to ask me, ‘How’d you get it?’ When I tell you something came from or something I know when it comes to Kendrick or whatever– I don’t give a f*ck who Kendrick is, I don’t give a f*ck about none of these n****s. Akademiks is the greatest single journalist you’ve ever heard of. You could be f*cking Kendrick if I said it that’s what it is. Let me be clear: I don’t need to talk to the artists. How much sh*t did I break about Yung Miami? You think I ever talked to her? Nope.”

Kendrick Lamar teased a new track in the video for “Not Like Us.” Outside the snippet, neither Lamar nor his team have revealed any information about a potential single or album. “Not Like Us,” a potential song of the summer, continues to break records at the top of the charts. 
This month, Drake released a collection of new music on his new website, 100GB. The releases include unreleased collaborations with Latto, Playboi Carti, Young Thug, and 21 Savage. All the tracks would eventually be released onto streaming platforms through Universal. 
Before 100GB, news circulated that Drake will allegedly release a new collaboration album with Lil Yachty. However, a release date or confirmation of the joint album has surfaced yet. Last month, Drake joined PartyNextDoor on stage and announced they would release an album together in the fall.
As part of the new releases, Drake posted a caption on his new Instagram account, claiming that “We will win Game 2” in his feud with Lamar.
