Metro Boomin and Future are taking no days off. The duo just dropped off the first trailer – and release date – for the follow-up to WE DON’T TRUST YOU entitled WE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU.
The album is set to release in just eight days, on April 12.
“Job’s not finished 4/12/24,” Metro wrote in an Instagram caption in the post revealing the trailer.
Both rappers wear all-white, with Future donning a cloth zip-up balaclava and black sunglasses and Metro in a crisp white Yankees fitted. The duo wear clean all-white suits, with Metro rocking a white tie as well. A WE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU title card appears at the end.
Stream the full trailer for the album above.
WE DON’T TRUST YOU has done numbers in the two weeks the project has been out, with the album debuting at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and (one of) the track’s fan-favorite cuts “Like That” with Kendrick Lamar also achieving the same feat.
