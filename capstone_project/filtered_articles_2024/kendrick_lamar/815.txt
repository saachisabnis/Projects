Drake sparked controversy online by wearing a t-shirt that read "RAP IS A JOKE" in his recent Instagram post. The caption accompanying the post hinted at the challenges of being at the top of the rap game. Speculation arose linking this to Drake's past feud with Kendrick Lamar, as well as to a recent news event involving a Donald Trump assassination attempt. However, the origins of the t-shirt actually trace back to a comedy rap duo from the Bay Area called Frank Stacks and L-Money. Despite the ongoing debate, Drake is unlikely to provide clarity on the matter. The t-shirt is available for purchase for $20. Whether this move by Drake is connected to Kendrick Lamar or not remains unclear, and fans will likely continue to speculate.
