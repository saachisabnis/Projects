Jermaine Dupri has called out the person who created a fake Kendrick Lamar diss song using AI.
The So So Def founder took to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday (April 18) to react to Sy The Rapper outing himself as the mastermind behind the viral track, which contained shots at Drake and J. Cole.

Alongside a screenshot of a Complex headline that reads: “How a 23-Year-Old From LA Fooled The Internet With an AI Kendrick Lamar Diss Track,” Dupri added his own unfiltered commentary.
“This is the dumbest most irresponsible thing I’ve seen in years, Hip Hop is too dangerous and Hip Hop has always gone against fake shit,” he wrote.
The fake song, titled “One Shot,” initially surfaced online on Monday (April 15), although it was immediately met with skepticism from listeners.
DJ Dahi, who has worked extensive with Kendrick Lamar, tweeted: “Man we live in a weird time, AI diss tracks!! we need Google authentications to make sure all this shit is real or not lol.”

The confusion was settled the following day when Sy The Rapper posted a video on social media showing how he made the song.
In his interview with Complex, Sy said he thought it would be obvious that the track was fake.

“I thought people were going to know that it was AI,” he said. “Although it did sound real, it sounded like an old version of Kendrick Lamar.
“It didn’t sound like his more up-to-date style, at least in my opinion. The style sounded kind of dated, so I just thought that would be a giveaway, but apparently it wasn’t.”

“I was going to make a Drake track first, but his track leaked, and I didn’t really get around to doing it,” he added, referencing Drizzy’s “Push Ups.”
Sy The Rapper also explained how he came up with the “One Shot” lyrics and why he ultimately decided to come clean about the song.

“I just had to place myself in Kendrick’s shoes, and it didn’t seem like Kendrick would come out swinging for the kill, considering that the [Drake] song was a ‘leaked’ track,” he said.
“[Drake’s leaked diss song] didn’t officially drop. So I was thinking more so in the mindset of, ‘If I’m Kendrick, I wouldn’t want to show my hand too early, since this song has been leaked and it’s not an official drop, so I can’t just come out swinging. I’ve got to come out with sort of a warning shot.’

“I really didn’t think it would affect anything, but when I saw that narrative, I’m like, ‘Nah, I can’t just let that rock,’ because that’s just not the truth. That’s what made me debunk it.”
Drake has since released “Push Ups” on streaming services, while Kendrick has yet to respond.
