Who Is Teddy Swims?
If you don’t know who Teddy Swims is, I really question where you have been this past year or so. How is that even possible?!
In any case, I'll help you out. 
Teddy Swims is an American singer-songwriter who crosses over several genres: R&B, soul, country and even pop music.
You might not have known this, but he actually got his start on YouTube back in 2019. He started doing covers of different songs and quickly became popular. Now, Swims is known all over the world.
You've probably heard some of his songs on pop and country radio. His most popular song to date is “Lose Control."
