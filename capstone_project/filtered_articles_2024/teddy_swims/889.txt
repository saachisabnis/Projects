Underwood says, "I have such fun memories of performing on New Year's Rockin' Eve in Times Square in both 2007 and 2015, and I'm so excited to perform just before the ball drops again this year.  I'm thrilled to celebrate 20 years since winning 'American Idol' by joining Ryan as he hosts his 20th New Year's Eve in Times Square."

Performers Highlights:
·	Marking 20 years since her 2005 life-changing "American Idol" win, current "Idol" judge Carrie Underwood will perform a medley of some of her biggest hits in Times Square just before midnight. 
·	Megan Moroney will take the Times Square stage to culminate an eventful year which included the release of her second album, "Am I Okay?" The CMA New Artist of the Year will perform a two-song medley of tracks from the album, which debuted at No. 3 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart and was her first Top 10 album on the Billboard 200 chart. Moroney also spent much of 2024 on tour with Kenny Chesney, hitting sold-out stadiums across the United States.
·	Legendary British singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor will make her "New Year's Rockin' Eve" debut with a performance of her platinum-certified hit "Murder on the Dancefloor" from Times Square.
