He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!
It's official, Teddy Swims will make his way to our corner of the world to put on his stellar show. The countdown has begun, and he and his buttery voice will melt your face off this August 7 at the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, as per TeddySwims.com.
Where do I see myself in 30 years? Still listening to the vocal stylings of this genius of a man. Teddy Swims song "Lose Control" has taken the world by storm, and we are all obsessed.
Take a listen to a live performance of the song below.
Teddy is a rising star in the music industry, and he is mostly known for his powerful and soulful vocals. Teddy is from Atlanta, Georgia, and originally gained a lot of his following from singing covers on his YouTube Channel. Teddy's talent has now extended beyond covers, and he is releasing his own music. So with that, he's on tour!
Teddy Swims' rendition of "Lose Control" with Kelly Clarkson is going viral on social media! With such a buzz, I bet that he'll have some amazing guest stars joining him for performances.
His talent is undeniable, and he will be showing it off for all of our enjoyment this August in New Hampshire!
