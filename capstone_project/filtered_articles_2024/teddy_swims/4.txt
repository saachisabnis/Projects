It’s Not a “Rumour,” A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac is at The National Theatre

See Iron & Wine at The Anthem
Samuel Ervin Beam, better known as the indie and folk singer Iron & Wine, heads to The Anthem Friday evening. He’ll be singing songs from his new album “Light Verse,” which touches on acceptance and moves a bit more to a certain peacefulness after lots of middle-aged angst. More information on getting tickets to the show can be found here.


Check out a “Firsthand Experience” at The National Museum of Women in the Arts
The National Museum of Women in the Arts is hosting a “Firsthand Experience” bringing contemporary artists together with students ages 13+ for hands-on programming.
