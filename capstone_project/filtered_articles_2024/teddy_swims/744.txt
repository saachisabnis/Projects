Week two of Friday Night Football in the books! We went to Roseville Area High to try and give a student a chance to win a $25k scholarship to ANY school thanks to The College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University. Also shoutout to weather for playing in our favor the past two weeks. Wayzata, we'll see you this Friday!
Saturday morning we all woke up and went to our boss, Rich's, house to see his new horses. It was so nice and Alyssa LOVES horses so she was living her animal dreams.
The HIGHLIGHT of my weekend was driving up to Hinckley to see TEDDY SWIMS at Grand Casino. We interviewed him before the show then watched him live and he is such a dope and down to earth human.
Go listen to Teddy Swims music, not just the songs you hear on the radio. His albums and singles are soooo good because of his sultry voice and the amount of passion he puts into his music.
Sunday I almost DIED! Alyssa and I were at Crave and after an intense battle with a bee, I lost the battle. This is the second time I've been stung and I truly thought my arm was going to fall off! It was nice knowing you all...
