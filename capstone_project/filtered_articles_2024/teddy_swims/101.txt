Well, our Minnesota man has done it! Adam Bohanan from Minneapolis won the battle round between Adam and his teammate Kevin James Graham. You can watch the performance below. They performed an amazing version of a song recorded by Teddy Swims called 'Lose Control.'
Reba had to make a decision to pick either Adam or Kevin to move on and she chose Adam!
Adam discovered 'Dirty Soul,' and took a great interest in artists like Al Green and Sam Cooke. Adam has lived in New York, Israel, England, and currently resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife, whom he hopes to start a family with soon.
There were times when you really thought that Adam was channeling Teddy Swims, as he can do all the amazing runs that Teddy can do, but when he put his falsetto high, not at the end of his performance, I think it sealed the deal for Reba.
That's not to say that Kevin was any less. He certainly has the stage presence; AND a very unique styling. Depending on what Reba was looking for, she could have just as easily chose Kevin, because he could wail on the high notes, and was just as fluent with harmonies as Adam.
I feel that Kevin was very loose with the tempo of the song; purposefully singing behind the beat just a tad; which he maintained through the entire performance. He hit runs and notes in his own style.
As all the coaches agreed, both of these artists are going to have music careers. The talent is great. I would go to see either one of these two in concert. Kevin sort of has a Johnny Depp vibe, while Adam has a Carrie Underwood kind of power, and a kind spirit.
Watch the entire performance below. Maybe these two should form a duet? They sure are amazing together.
