Rock-and-roll legends Aerosmith have relaunched their Peace Out Tour after previously postponing the run stemming from frontman Steven Tyler’s vocal cord injury. The band returned today with an updated list of dates. The tour is slated to feature special guest Black Crowes, fresh off the release of their first collection in 15 years, Happiness Bastards. The run will now pick up on Friday, Sept. 2, in Pittsburgh, with a one-night-only performance from one-off accompaniment Teddy Swims.
During the forthcoming 40-stop run, the esteemed act will draw on its rich five-decade history, reviving classic material from its expansive discography, ranging from its self-titled 1973 debut to 2012’s Music from Another Dimension! HX Certified Live! will enhance the live music experience by equipping each arena appearance with high-fidelity and leading-edge technology.
As noted, the makeup dates follow the band’s previous postponement, meaning the locations remain the same. However, given heightened interest, a trio of new concerts has been added to the band’s schedule, including their aforementioned Pittsburgh opener and follow-up on Monday, Sept. 23, in Philadelphia. The group’s third and final newly added show comes late into their touring lineup, landing on Feb. 11, 2025, at the Kia Center in Orlando, Fla.  
All previously purchased tickets will be honored for the rescheduled shows. Ticketholders will receive more information via email. Tickets for the rescheduled dates and newly added shows are on sale Friday, April 12th at 10 a.m. local time on ticketmaster.com.
