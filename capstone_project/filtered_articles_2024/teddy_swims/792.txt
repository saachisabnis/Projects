Some of the year's biggest newcomers will also take the stage, including Laufey, Ernest and Dasha.
"Oh my god, I was so excited I couldn't believe it, I was like 'REALLY!' And then I told my dad immediately, who grew up watching Dick Clark and he was freaking out.  So it was like a fun family moment," Laufey revealed.
"I obviously grew up watching the show so it was cool to call my mom and tell her I was going to do that," Ernest added.
"I'm just so honored to be asked to be part of this amazing thing - I mean, there's no better way to celebrate the new year and it ties a wonderful bow on the crazy year I've had," Dasha said.
