"It’s always such an honour and so humbling to see the different walks of life that come together to listen to music"
Teddy Swims has given a surprise intimate performance at a train station ahead of this year’s edition of Reading & Leeds.
The American singer took over Reading train station for an impromptu acoustic performance of his songs ‘Lose Control’ and ‘Funeral’ ahead of his appearance at the festivals.
Swims – real name Jaten Collin Dimsdale – also performed his song ‘The Door’. The stripped-down performance was in collaboration with Rockstar Energy Drink, who are sponsoring this year’s festival.
The singer showed up to the train station sporting an incognito hat and sunglasses to seamlessly blend into the crowd full of festival goers and passers-by going about their commute to the festival, passing through the station, before making his way to an unattended piano set-up inside the station. Check out the footage of the performance below.
