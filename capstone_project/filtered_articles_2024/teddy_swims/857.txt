	From the start, Dee Dee brought an exciting energy to the stage as she wowed the crowd with her vocal brilliance. Halfway through the song, she kicked off her shoes, letting the moment take over as she poured her heart into the performance. The judges couldn’t help but take notice.

	“You knocked your shoes off. You knocked my shoes off,” Howie Mandel said, nodding to Dee Dee’s spontaneous decision to perform barefoot. “You made the song your own, and you were amazing.”

	Simon Cowell, never one to hold back his opinion, was hugely impressed by the powerhouse performance, saying, “This is what it’s all about—someone who isn’t a full-time singer seizes the moment and shows the world who they are. Dee Dee, I think you’ve got a real shot at winning this competition.”

	Sofia Vergara, clearly impressed, added, “This was your lane, and you took control of it. This performance topped your audition—you’re a star tonight.”

	But it was Heidi Klum who sealed the deal. “Dee Dee, your voice has such a rich tone, and you look stunning tonight. But I felt like something was missing—like a sparkly belt, a sparkly ring, something gold,” Klum said, just before she hit the Golden Buzzer, sending the singer straight to the finals amid a shower of golden confetti. 

	“My stomach was talking to me, and you were the best tonight—you’re amazing!”

	As the confetti fell, Dee Dee stood in disbelief, thanking the crowd and the judges. “Oh my God, thank you so much, America. I love you.”

	“Lose Control,” the song Dee Dee performed, has been a major hit for Teddy Swims. The track debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2023 and climbed to No. 1 in March this year. It would go on to stay on the chart for a whopping 54 weeks.

	The competition may be tough, but with this performance and the Golden Buzzer, Dee Dee Simon has positioned herself as a serious contender for the AGT 2024 title.
