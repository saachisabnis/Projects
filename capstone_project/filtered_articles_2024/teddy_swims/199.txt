Taylor Swift may well have led the nominations, but it was an array of home-grown stars bringing the glamour as the MTV Europe Music Awards got underway in Manchester on Sunday evening. 
The English city hosted the annual ceremony for the first time in its storied 29-year history, with Co-Op Live Arena chose as the appropriately cavernous venue for this year's event. 
Having already made history as the first person to host the MTV Europe Music Awards for the third time, Rita Ora claimed the red carpet as her own as she arrived alongside her filmmaker husband Taika Waititi, 49.
The singer, 33, who wore a dusty pink feathered gown, was joined by the equally glamorous Maya Jama, whose safety-pin embellished dress conjured images of Elizabeth Hurley's iconic Versace outfit from 1994. 
The BRIT Award-winning singer Raye, 27, and radio presenter Vick Hope, 35, also ensured the fashion stakes were raised as guests made their way into the venue.

Having already made history as the first person to host the MTV Europe Music Awards for the third time, Rita Ora claimed the red carpet as her own as she arrived alongside husband Taika Waititi 
Rita looked incredible in a pink feathered dress as she posed on the star-studded red carpet
Rita looked sensational in the light pink gown which was adorned with hundreds of feathers and featured a corset style top.
She boosted her height with huge strappy silk heels and wore her brunette tresses in a wavy style while opting for a glamorous makeup look. 
Meanwhile Maya put on a jaw-dropping display as she arrived on the red carpet. The Love Island host, 30, commanded attention in a plunging black gown with a daringly high slit, showcasing her cleavage and toned legs.
Her racy dress boasted cut-outs, held together with giant gold safety pins, and almost identical to the iconic Versace number that shot Elizabeth Hurley to fame.
The actress, 59, went from an unknown star to making headlines around the world, when she wore the £3,000 plunging gown to the 1994 premiere of Four Weddings And A Funeral, with then-boyfriend Hugh Grant.
And exactly three decades later, Maya brought the career-making gown back to the red carpet, ensuring she stood out from the crowd.
Raye put on a very animated display as she hit the red carpet. The British singer, who is nominated for Best UK & Ireland Act, Best Artist, and Best Live, posed up a storm in a quirky dark gold gown. 
Raye's dress hugged every inch of her jaw-dropping figure and boasted sparking bejewelled detailing and quirky hem.

Raye oozed confidence as she posed up a storm ahead of her performance to a crowd of 20K fans at the ceremony.
It comes after organisers were forced to cancel last year's event in Paris due to security fears amid the Israel and Hamas war. 
Rita paid a heartfelt tribute to Liam Payne at the event. She gave an emotional speech to honour the former One Direction singer, who died in October, aged 31. 
Rita - who collaborated with Liam on the 2018 single For You - broke down in tears as she said: 'I just want to take a moment to remember someone very, very dear to us. 
'We lost him recently and he was a big part of the MTV world and my world and I think a lot of yours at home and everybody in here tonight.
'Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could.
'He brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on the world.'
Breaking down she added: 'So let's just take a moment to remember our friend Liam...'
Rita previously admitted to being 'devastated' by Liam's passing.
The singer took to social media in October to pay tribute to Liam, sweetly saying that he had 'the kindest soul'.
Rita wrote on X: 'I'm devastated [broken-heart emoji] He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. 
'I loved working with him so much - he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage. 
'This tragic news breaks my heart. Sending all my love and prayers to his family and loved ones. Our song For You takes on a whole new meaning for me now. R.I.P [dove emoji] (sic)'

'Thank you to the fans for voting on this. You're the reason any great thing happens to me and I know it every single day. I'm so thankful for it and this is just so exciting and so wonderful. I had the best time touring in Europe this summer so it is just wonderful for you to do this.'

Speaking on stage at Co-op Live in Manchester, Busta, 52, said: 'This is my first time here. I’ve never got an award from MTV before.
'Thirty-four years of professionally recording, this is the first time I’m getting an award from MTV. It feels f****** incredible."
Busta thanked his mother - who he described as his best friend - and fellow rap icon LL Cool J during his acceptance speech.

He explained: 'I want to salute my brother LL Cool J. Everything that I aspired to be, that man planted that seed.'

Because I am never going to stop."
Busta previously described winning the award as a "celebration" of hip-hop culture.
The rapper - who performed a medley of his songs after receiving his award - said: 'I am beyond honoured and grateful to receive the MTV EMA Global Icon Award.
'This recognition is not only a celebration of my career but also of hip-hop culture. To be acknowledged on this global stage is a reminder that hip-hop has no boundaries - and neither do I!'
