The list includes Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and more
The Top 10 highest-grossing music world tours for this year have been revealed, along with how much they made. Check it out below.
The new report into the live music sector over the past 12 months was shared by Pollstar, and confirmed which 10 artists were behind the biggest tours.
Unsurprisingly, it was Taylor Swift‘s massive ‘Eras Tour’ which took the top spot – breaking the record as the highest-grossing tour of all time, bringing in a reported $2.2billion (£1.73b) since it began. Running for a combined total of 21 months across 149 shows, the stadium tour marked a new high for the global pop star, and ended on December 8 at Vancouver, British Columbia’s BC Place Stadium.
Last December, at the tour’s midpoint, Swift made history when the tour became the first to gross $1billion (£796million). Prior to that, it was estimated that, once it had concluded, the tour would be the most lucrative in music history. In total, 10,168,008 people across the world attended the ‘Eras’ shows, and the money made from 2024 alone is reportedly just over $1billion.

Also on the list of the Top 10 highest-grossing music world tours for 2024 is Coldplay, who are continuing to make huge leaps with their environmentally-friendly ‘Music Of The Spheres Tour’. The dates have seen them produce 59 per cent less CO2 emissions than previous tours in 2016 and 2017, and in August was declared to be the highest-grossing rock tour ever. According to the new list by Pollstar, it has brought in $421.7million (£332.3m).
Elsewhere in the Top 10 is P!nk with her ‘Summer Carnival’ tour ($367.3m), Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band ($251.3m), The Rolling Stones’ ‘Hackney Diamonds’ tour ($235m) and Metallica’s ‘M72’ tour ($179.4m).
Check out the full list below.

The report of the highest-grossing tours of 2024 comes as some huge names have been making more of an effort to support their smaller counterparts in recent times. Coldplay, for instance, confirmed earlier this year that 10 per cent of the proceeds from their 2025 shows will be donated to the Music Venue Trust – helping to keep UK grassroots music venues open and fighting for the survival and development of upcoming artists.
It’s an example of a ticket levy also recently practised by Enter Shikari, Katy Perry and Sam Fender, which has since been backed by the UK government.
Earlier this month, council members in Glasgow also backed the proposition, and claimed upcoming performances in the city – ranging from comedy shows, Kylie Minogue and WWE events – could raise £160,000 alone for grassroots venues.
This echoed an argument made by Bristol’s night-time economy advisor Carly Heath too, who said a levy added onto tickets could generate up to £1million each year and allow the venues and emerging artists in the UK to have a more secure future.
Although in the spring, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee welcomed the UK government’s new backing of a levy on gigs at arena level and above, some have called for a clear deadline for the industry to take urgent action.
