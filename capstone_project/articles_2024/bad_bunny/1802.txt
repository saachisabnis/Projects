	Travis Scott’s Days Before Rodeo is viewed as a cult classic by the masses. The 12-track project boasted popular records such as “Drugs You Should Try It,” “Skyfall” featuring Young Thug, “Mamacita” featuring Thug and Rich Homie Quan, and “Sloppy Toppy” featuring Migos and Peewee Longway. Other featured artists included Big Sean and The 1975. 

Days Before Rodeo was the precursor to his debut studio album, 2015’s Rodeo, both of which cemented the Houston artist as a future star in the music industry. One year later, he released Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight and then took things to another level with his current magnum opus, Astroworld, in 2018.

	Scott’s latest LP was 2023’s Utopia, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold 496,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. The album featured Drake, The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, Beyoncé, Future, SZA, Playboi Carti, Young Thug, and more.
