Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck showed some courtside PDA during their latest outing!
On Saturday, Mr. and Mrs. Affleck attended the Los Angeles Lakers vs. Golden State Warriors game inside of Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. 
The pair attended the game with Affleck's 11-year-old son, Samuel, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner. While the game was in full swing, Affleck and Lopez sat with their arms around each other.
In a couple of sweet moments, the pair leaned in close to chat with each other. The pair also held hands as they made their way down the court, following the game that saw the Warriors beat the Lakers 128-121.
After the game, Affleck's son had a cute moment of his own when he met Warriors star, Stephen Curry. Meanwhile, Lopez reunited with collaborator Bad Bunny -- who is currently in the midst of his Most Wanted World Tour.
Also in attendance was Kim Kardashian and her son, Saint West, who had courtside seats as well.
Affleck, 51, and Lopez, 54, made their last glamorous appearance together in February. The Oscar-winning actor joined his wife in Los Angeles for the premiere of the This Is Me...Now: A Love Story musical experience. 
Lopez credits her husband -- whom she tied the knot with in 2022 -- for being one of the biggest inspirations for her return to music.
"When Ben and I got back together, it was just like, 'I want to make music again, I want to get back in the studio,'" she previously told ET. "I was very, very inspired."
She continued, "Once the music was done, it felt so special to me. It felt like something very different than I had ever done, even though I've written about love my whole career."
