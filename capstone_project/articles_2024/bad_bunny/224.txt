Becky G is coming to your block.
Well, maybe not your block, per se. But the Latin music superstar, who first gained attention with the single “Becky from the Block,” is heading to the home of the SAP Center in San Jose.
Bay Area fans can make plans to catch the vocalist when her Casa Gomez: Otro Capítulo Tour hits the home of the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 21. Showtime is 8 p.m. and tickets start at 8 p.m., ticketmaster.com.
The Southern California native, who was born in Los Angeles County and raised in Riverside County, is out on the road in support of the recently released “Encuentros.” It’s Becky G’s fourth full-length Spanish language studio album, following last year’s “Esquinas.”
The singer has experienced much success during her still-relatively young recording career. Notably, her first two full-length studio efforts — 2019’s “Mala Santa” and 2022’s “Esquemas” — proved to be multiplatinum-selling success stories.
Her best-known songs include “Mayores” (with Bad Bunny), “Sin Pijama” (with Natti Natasha) and “Cuando Te Besé” (with Paulo Londra).
