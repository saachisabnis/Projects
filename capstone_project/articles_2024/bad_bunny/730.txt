The show — now in its 49th season — returned with new episodes in mid-October. And, in typical “SNL” fashion, the long-running show brought in a very special guest for its season premiere on Oct. 14: Pete Davidson, the born-and-raised Staten Islander who joined “SNL” in 2014 at the ripe age of 20, and bowed out at the end of Season 47. Ice Spice was the musical guest.
Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny pulled double duty on Oct. 21. Stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze hosted the Oct. 28 episode, alongside musical guest the Foo Fighters.
Nov. 11 saw “Dune” and “Wonka” actor Timothée Chalamet host for his second time. He was joined by musical guest Boygenius, which is comprised of singers Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker. On Nov. 18, Jason Momoa returned to “SNL” to host for the second time. Tate McRae made her debut as musical guest.
On Dec. 2, actress Emma Stone hosted alongside musical guest Noah Kahan. It was Stone’s fifth time hosting “SNL,” which inducted her into the illustrious Five-Timer’s Club. On Dec. 9, actor Adam Driver hosted, with Olivia Rodrigo as musical guest. On Dec. 16, former “Saturday Night Live” superstar Kate McKinnon returned to Studio 8H for the first time since her exit from the show in 2022 at the end of Season 47. She was joined by singer Billie Eilish.
Hosting the very first show of 2024 on Jan. 20 was “Priscilla” and “Saltburn” actor Jacob Elordi, alongside musical guest Renee Rapp. Both Elordi and Rapp made their “SNL” debuts.
The Jan. 27 episode featured “Madame Web” actress Dakota Johnson, alongside musical guest Justin Timberlake. 
Fans of “SNL” will be happy to know former Staten Islander Colin Jost, the longest-serving “Weekend Update” anchor in the show’s history, is still at the desk. Joining Jost for Season 49 of “SNL” is his longtime “Weekend Update” co-anchor Michael Che, plus Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, Punkie Johnson, Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang.
Featured players Marcello Hernández, James Austin Johnson, Molly Kearney, Michael Longfellow, Sarah Sherman and Devon Walker have also returned. Chloe Troast is the only new addition to the cast.
