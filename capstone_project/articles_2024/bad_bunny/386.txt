Just when you think you’ve caught up with the best adidas shoe trends, there’s always another stylish Three Stripes sneaker waiting in the wings. The Adidas Taekwondo shoes appear to be the next under-the-radar adidas walking shoe to be be dubbed the next “it” sneaker, especially when the slender style was spotted on street style stars and celebrities in recent weeks — and the shoe’s growing TikTok popularity could make these coveted kicks harder to get your hands on. 
The popularity of the Adidas Taekwondo shoe may seem unexpected, considering its roots in martial arts performance, but its low-profile design falls right in line with top retro sneaker trends sparked by Adidas Samba shoes popularity. The laceless slip-on sneaker dons similar flat soles to coveted adidas SL 72 shoes in a nostalgic, Y2K-inspired unisex design, but it offers a more elevated touch to everyday ensembles with smooth leather uppers with stylish forefoot stitching that creates a quilted effect. The early aughts archival model saw a stylish re-issue in 2019, but it’s back with a much more stylish upgrade for 2024.

Ayo Edebiri, for one, has been sporting her Adidas Taekwondos in off-duty ensembles, whether shopping with friends or attending Kaia Gerber‘s birthday bash at Disney Land in September. Jennie from Black Pink was also seen donning the sneaker earlier this summer, influencing fans to snag a pair as soon as they dropped at Adidas. Bad Bunny is only adding to the hype; just recently the singer debuted his upcoming twist on the Taekwondo during Paris Fashion Week on a night out with Kendall Jenner. His “Ballerina Shoe” collaboration with Adidas swaps its classic leather uppers for canvas, a change of translucent gum soles, and soft, slipper-like elastic collars.
TikTok considers the OG Adidas model a “grail”, where over 46 million dedicated posts feature unboxing hauls, styling videos, and reviews that corroborate it as the next It-shoe. Like most Adidas shoe trends, the heritage sneaker has been reframed as a style statement, where online creators are invoking the viral “wrong shoe” theory in eclectic stylings. Its versatile design allows the Adidas Taekwondo to play with pared-down athleisure, chic office wear, and everything in between. Just take a scroll on TikTok for a wealth of outfit inspiration — one creator paired them with frilly women’s socks for feminine flair, while two friends in matching pairs juxtaposed the shoe’s narrow profile with a sheer midi skirt and baggy trousers.
