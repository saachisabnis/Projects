	Thanks to “Sandunga,” the indie imprint nabs its first top 10 on the overall Latin Airplay tally. Previously, “Navidad Pa’ La Calle” took the company to a No. 42 high in 2020. The label, however, scored its first top 10 on any Billboard chart when “Navidad” peaked at No. 5 on Tropical Airplay in Dec. 2020

	“Sandunga” is also first charting collab from Don Omar and Wisin & Yandel since 2007, when “No Se De Ella (My Space)” reached No. 20.

	Further, “Sandunga” earns Don Omar his 21st top 10 on Latin Airplay. The Puerto Rican rapper was last in the top 10 with the chart-topping “Podemos Repetirlo,” with Chencho Corleone, leading for one week last September.

	Wisin & Yandel, meanwhile, up their career count to 29 top 10s as a duo, the fourth-most among Latin rhythm acts since the Latin Airplay chart launched in 1994. Among Latin rhythm acts on Latin Airplay, Daddy Yankee has the most top 10s, with 49. Here’s a look at the Latin rhythm acts with the most top 10s on Latin Airplay:

	In addition to its new top 10 on Latin Airplay, “Sandunga” holds steady at its No. 6 high on Latin Rhythm Airplay for a third week.
