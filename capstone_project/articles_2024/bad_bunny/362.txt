* ICYMI: ShotSpotter microphones have been hidden from police and the public, now the secret locations of microphones are revealed.  WIRED…
- SoundThinking equipment has been installed at more than a thousand elementary and high schools; they are perched atop dozens of billboards, scores of hospitals, and within more than a hundred public housing complexes.
- An analysis of sensor distribution in US cities found nearly 70 percent of people who live in a neighborhood with at least one SoundThinking sensor identified as Black or Latino.
- In February, a leaked internal report from the State’s Attorney’s Office in Illinois’ Cook County found that nearly a third of arrests stemming from a ShotSpotter alert had nothing to do with a gun.

* Paul Sullivan | Jerry Reinsdorf’s about-face on the White Sox possibly leaving Chicago is history — and hypocrisy — repeating itself: The good news for Chicago White Sox fans is the team eventually will be up for sale, according to Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. The bad news is it won’t happen as long as Reinsdorf is alive. Before he does go, Reinsdorf — who turns 88 Sunday — wants to leave Chicago with a special gift: a shiny, new ballpark for the Sox that would anchor the redevelopment of The 78 site in the South Loop. Sox fans would enjoy the gift long after he’s gone, and Reinsdorf believes the city and state would benefit as well.

But that six-decade tradition is set to come to an end Sunday with the last deep-fried pastry passing the counter at 704 Keokuk St. Lincoln’s original home to Mel-O-Cream is closing as owners relocate the business to a newly constructed structure at 227 N.

-  Nick - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 8:51 am:  $8.6 million is more than what sharpshooter cost the city the entire year of 2023. 
It honestly makes no sense to me. If this is important / effective enough that it has to be extended through the Democratic National Convention, then it should just be extended period.
But if it’s as ineffective as the activists and studies say, which I’m inclined to believe, then Johnson is just giving away money here.

-  Three Dimensional Checkers - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 9:19 am:  It is painfully obvious Mayor Johnson had no plan to cancel Shotspotter, despite a transition period and 10 months in office. With the deadline approaching, he just threw together a press release that he hoped would avoid the issue. No matter your viewpoint or ideology, everyone should demand basic competency from their Mayor.



-  Charles Edward Cheese - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 9:46 am:  The ShotSpotter contract mismanagement is just another masterclass from Mayor Johnson’s administration - It’s not effective and we won’t extend it, let’s cancel the contract, oops we let it auto renew, let’s cancel it early, just kidding we’ll temporarily extend it at a higher cost, etc. Goodness gracious the inexperience is showing and the gaffes just keep piling up.



-  OneMan - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 9:48 am:  I went to grade school and high school in Dolton, and as a youth, I worked for the Village of Dolton as a lifeguard at the public pool and the pool in the retirement center (an old modified hotel).  Working at the pool, the trustees and folks from public works would stop by since the pool wasn’t owned by the park district but the village, so we were public works employees.  I got to learn a lot about city government over those summers; the public works guy would tell you all sorts of stories, and the trustees would talk quite a bit.  I think they were just happy to chat with interested people. There was some drama, but it was always low-key.  A useless piece of trivia is was one of the largest towns in the Chicago area with a volunteer fire department (not even pay-per-call for the volunteers) at the time.
I also realize now that I am older it would have been an excellent place to ‘get away with stuff’ if you didn’t draw attention to yourself. Heck, the town owned a retirement center (they purchased it to keep it out of bankruptcy), and there were all sorts of opportunities to take care of folks and the like.
Whoever recommended that she draw this much attention to herself did not do the mayor any favors. Heck, Instagram and Twitter have all sorts of folks talking about her and Dolotn as well as miss-pronouncing the name (Doll-ton), not (Daal-ton).  This much attention to these issues never ends well.
Also, she has a detail, and the city spent money on an ice rink blows my mind.



-  Chicagonk - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 9:49 am:  @Nick - If the metric is whether ShotSpotter reduces crime, that is inconclusive. It’s a tool and police departments view it as an effective one at improving response times and responding to shots fired incidents that do not have a corresponding 911 call. I think it is likely somewhat useful and do not really understand why activists are expending so much political capital on this, but in the end it going away is probably not a big deal.

Maybe, but the huge percentage of false alarms/no evidence of gunfire is diverting a whole lot of resources.
And there’s also this

-  Three Dimensional Checkers - Friday, Feb 23, 24 @ 12:54 pm:  To me, it seems like Shotspotter opponents have the same non-binding promise they had 10 months ago, and Shotspotter has a contract for millions of dollars. Opponents probably should not be throwing around the gullible word.
