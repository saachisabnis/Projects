Well, it looks like the Easter Bunny needs to step up his hiding game. The Blaze Easter Keg has been discovered, bringing this year's hunt to a close.
The Grand Prize: Bayern Brewing will award 52 FREE Growler Fills (1 year = 52 weeks)
Our winner, Rob, discovered the keg hidden near the Tower Street Trails on Missoula's west side.
Let's do a quick rundown of the clues. We typically begin our hunt by eliminating neighborhoods to search through. Then we get more specific as the days go on.
