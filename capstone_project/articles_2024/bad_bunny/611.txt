Rihanna has broken two more records, as she has now become the female artist with both the most diamond singles, and the most diamond-certified songs.
The RIAA is reporting that as of Friday (May 30), four singles — “Needed Me,” “Work,” “Umbrella,” and “Stay” — were bestowed with the honor, which means that they’ve each moved at least 10 million units (with a unit being one physical sale or digital download, or 150 on-demand audio or video streams).

That brings the singer’s total number of diamond songs to seven — the aforementioned four alongside “We Found Love,” the Eminem collaboration “Love the Way You Lie,” and the appropriately-named “Diamonds,”
The Fenty billionaire, too, shared the good news on her Instagram page on the same day. “Ain’t no back and forth,” she wrote in the caption.

Rihanna isn’t the only artist who has enjoyed diamond success recently.
Nicki Minaj just earned her second diamond single with “Bang Bang,” the 2014 single featuring Jessie J and Ariana Grande.

The RIAA has confirmed that the single — which initially went gold (sales of 500,000 units) in October 2014, three months after its initial release — was certified diamond as of Thursday (May 23).
“Bang Bang” is Minaj’s second song to achieve such a certification. 2011’s “Super Bass,” which initially went gold in November of that year, was certified diamond on March 29, 2024.

The only female rapper to have more diamond singles than the Young Money First Lady is Cardi B. The “Bodak Yellow” rapper achieved her third diamond single with the Bad Bunny-assisted “I Like It” back in December 2021.
As for Riri herself, she and her boo A$AP Rocky recently made headlines during their date night.

In a video that went viral on May 15, the billionaire can be seen mouthing “That’s my baby daddy!” while making appropriate hand gestures as the Mobster cuts up on the classic Cam’ron track, “Oh Boy.”
The pair, of course, share two sons: RZA and Riot Rose.

Despite being together for quite some time, it’s clear that the Hip Hop power couple can’t get enough of each other.
RiRi was signing autographs in New York City on Sunday night (May 12) when one fan said to the Barbadian singer: “Rih, happy Mother’s Day, sweetheart.”

After taking a moment to process the remark, Rocky took issue with the fan’s forwardness and replied: “Don’t be romantic to my girl like that!”
He also squared up to the fan who had a flower ready for the pop star and said: “Wassup, n-gga?!”

However, Rocky soon began laughing and reassured the fan: “I’m playing with you, man” before they shook hands.
“It’s all love,” the man replied, taking the joke in stride.
