Of course this year's A-list celebs brought their fashion A-games.
The 2024 Oscars are officially here, people! Each year, the Academy Awards highlights the most recent best performances in the world of film, but—let's be honest—the red carpet prior to the highly-anticipated ceremony delivers some of the best performances in the world of ~fashion~.
And this year is no different, and with the list of attendees being fully s-t-a-c-k-e-d (Mahershala Ali, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michelle Yeoh, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lawrence, and Kate McKinnon are just a handful of the iconic presenters who will grace the stage during the ceremony), of course celebs got dressed to the nines in stunning 'fits. Enter: us (dressed to the nines in our finest PJs), ready to discuss every must-see look and highlight moment of the 2024 Oscars red carpet. Enjoy!
