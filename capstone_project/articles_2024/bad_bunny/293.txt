“Your House” – Inhaler
Review by Emily Rabeno
Inhaler, the Dublin-based indie rock band, first caught my attention in early January. I started with just two or three of their tracks on repeat, but by the end of September, my interest had intensified, skyrocketing from a modest 150 listens to a shocking 2,200 in October alone. This obsession continued with the release of their single, “Your House,” on October 29, 2024.
“Your House” is more than just another track; it’s a masterpiece in songwriting and performance. The melody is so beautiful, and the lyrics are rich with meaning, weaving an emotional narrative that feels both personal and universal. What sets this song apart from their previous work is its distinctive sound and the harmonization. The lead singer’s interplay with the background vocals is nothing short of breathtaking and might be some of the best harmonies I’ve ever heard.
One lyric, in particular, stands out: “There ain’t a sharp enough knife to cut me out of your life.” This line alone encapsulates the song’s depth, and raw emotion with sad imagery. The way it’s delivered, makes it one of the most powerful and memorable lyrics I’ve encountered. “Your House” isn’t just a song; it’s an experience that cements Inhaler’s place as a standout in modern indie rock.
“Mezzanine” – Declan McKenna
Review by Emily Rabeno
Declan McKenna is often recognized for his breakout hit “Brazil,” released in 2015, but his true brilliance shines in the track “Mezzanine” from his 2024 album, What Happened to the Beach?. Released on February 9th, 2024, this song quickly became a personal favorite, and I’ve spent all year obsessed with this song.
“Mezzanine” beautifully showcases McKenna’s vocal skills, navigating a dynamic landscape of highs and lows that highlight his range. The lyrics, especially the lines, “And so I woke up, praise the night. I woke up, chose the man to criticize,” are delivered with such a raw intensity that feels like the satisfying sensation of a good back scratch. The addition of trumpets was such a good idea, elevating the song with a rich, textured sound that complements its emotional peaks and valleys.
“Same” – Cage The Elephant
Review by Emily Rabeno
After a five-year hiatus from releasing new music, Cage The Elephant made a triumphant return with Neon Pill, their sixth studio album, released in May 2024. Featuring 12 tracks, the album shows a blend of their signature style and a fresh new sound. Track 11, “Same,” stands out as my personal favorite. With its introspective lyrics and haunting melodies, the song explores themes of identity and resilience, capturing a raw, emotional depth that resonates deeply. “Same” features atmospheric guitar riffs and frontman Matt Shultz’s evocative vocals, reminiscent of their earlier work on albums like Thank You, Happy Birthday and Melophobia. As a longtime fan of the band, I find “Same” evokes the familiar essence of their earlier albums, bringing a comforting sense of nostalgia while showcasing their continued growth. It’s a track that feels both fresh and timeless, perfectly putting their past sound with the maturity they’ve gained over the years.
“Breakthespell” – Mk.gee
Review by Andy Cook
From my favorite album of 2024 Two Star & The Dream Police, Mk.gee’s “breakthespell” is a track that will place you under a spell you won’t want to break. Mike wants listeners to acknowledge his experience of being in love with someone after breaking up with them, and how her “spell” is forever branded in him. Its soft instrumentation with longing, powerful vocals immerses listeners into his struggle. The minimalist writing gets the point across in a masterful way. It’s (in my opinion) the perfect breakup song, as it isn’t overly dramatic but doesn’t shy away from his truth.
“Dream Sequence” – Jane Remover
Review by Andy Cook
Who would I be if I didn’t discuss Jane Remover. “Dream Sequence” by Jane is a powerful, hard-hitting shoe-gazey take on her own song. In Sept. 2022, she released “Aberdeen Dream Sequence” under her side-project “venturing” and for fans of her music, we wanted an official release on streaming services. “Dream Sequence” came packed with “Flash in the Pan,” a drill-infused track perfect to hear performed live (which I saw live in September!), but sonically, it couldn’t be more different. It’s about wanting a relationship to stick and feeling regretful for having it not. The refrain is my personal favorite part of the song; “If you could go anywhere, where would you go? / If you could go anywhere, where would you go? / If you could go anywhere, would you want to stay here?” It’s very simple but hits hard. A great song for late-night drives. 
“Rewind featuring bladee” – Charli xcx feat. bladee
Review by Andy Cook
In the summer, I got really into two artists. Week in and week out these two artists would be the only thing I listened to. Those artists are Charli xcx & Bladee, making me a Drained Angel. I listened to every Charli xcx album in preparation for BRAT and fell in love with her discography, seeing how impactful it is on the modern state of pop music. I’ve known about Bladee’s music for a long time, but never got into it until this summer after hyper-obsessing over his 2024 record “Cold Visions.” “Rewind featuring bladee” is my 2024 in one song. And the song is very good, its electronic instrumental compliments the vocals, keeping the original message of “Rewind” alive but enough for it to be its own thing.
“Nobody’s Soldier” – Hozier
Review by Giuliana DeGrazio
Andrew Byrne, famously known as Hozier, is the singer of the hit song “Take Me To Church.” He released his new EP this year titled Unaired. This EP consists of three songs that didn’t make it onto his 2023 hit album Unreal Unearth. Which coincidentally is why this EP is called Unaired! The first one is titled “Nobody’s Soldier.” This allows Hozier to expand on his vocal range and hit those high notes we all loved in his 2023 trending song “Too Sweet.” The lyrics in this song are about tolerance and peace in the world today. This represents his live shows because he finishes his concerts by expressing there should just be peace and love all over the world! Some of these lyrics include “I don’t wanna choose between being a salesman or a soldier / Just let me look a little older, let me step a little bolder / Choose between being a butcher or a pauper / Honey, I’m taking no orders, gonna be nobody’s soldier.” This song is bursting with an upbeat melody for 3 minutes and 57 seconds straight. This is normal for a Hozier song because he is such a powerful songwriter/singer! 
“Bad Dream” (Alternate Version) – Wallows
Review by Giuliana DeGrazio
Wallows is a three-person rock band. The members consist of Dylan Minnette, Braeden Lemasters, and Cole Preston. You might know Dylan Minnette from a variety of TV shows. They have released an Alternate Version of their hit song “Bad Dream.” “Bad Dream” was featured on their 2024 album Model. Wallows loved this version of the song so much, they wanted to share it with their fans! This new Alternate Version of the song is more rock-based, with more guitar riffs added, and a lot more drumming! Through this Alternate Version the eeriness and uncertainty of a bad dream are definitely shown, combined with the lyrics and this new rock beat they came up with. It is 3 minutes and 16 seconds of pure music magic if you ask me! Personally, they are one of my favorite groups of all time, and I have seen them on tour many times. Wallows put on quite an epic concert, especially with their more upbeat rock songs like this one!
“Growing Up” – Jason Schmidt
Review by Giuliana DeGrazio
Jason Schmidt is an actor/performer. He is best known for his role as Sodapop Curtis in the 2024 Tony Award Winning Musical “The Outsiders,” and he also played an acting role in the TV show “Grease: The Rise of the Pink Ladies.” This song is about growing up and living life while feeling like you’re alone at the same time. Also missing your friends and family, as you navigate adulthood. This emotional journey that Jason Schmidt takes us on expresses missing nostalgic memories of when you were a kid. While this is a slower alternative rock song, it expresses what we all feel which is the uncertainty of our future. One of the lyrics that I relate to the most is “I didn’t know if I would ever make it out this way.” I certainly feel like this, as do so many others, because the future can be such a scary thing to think about, especially when you do not know where you are going to end up, which is why it’s important to keep going. Which is what Jason Schmidt expresses by the end of the song. By singing the lyrics “Now I’m ready for life.” This song is definitely one of my top picks of 2024. I have been playing it on repeat for weeks because it is relatable, Jason Schmidt truly has the voice of an angel, and it is a comfort song for me while I am away at college. 
“Frownland” – Chat Pile
Review by Sophia Veronsky
The grip that Chat Pile, especially their new album- Cool World has on me is nothing more than a sludgy, grimy, and filthy obsession. The band from Oklahoma City has been around for a while now, but their new album brings them to a new level, especially their song- “Frownland.” Incidentally, this song is named after a film of the same name (released in 2007, directed by Ronald Bronstein). Both the song and movie are littered with themes of being isolated, awkward, and the feeling of uselessness in a world so much bigger than them. The parallels, unintentionally or not, made this a standout track off their new album. The direct and punctual lyrics and their signature aggressive sludge sound create a cry of desperation that no one is hearing. It is dark, it is bleak, and yet it is exploratory of a mind that isn’t ours. A diatribe of a silenced outcast with cries of a lack of attention creates a masterful song for anyone interested in experimental rock genres.
“Veneficium” – Xiu Xiu
Review by Sophia Veronsky
Long-standing pioneers of experimental music, and a favorite group of mine, Xiu Xiu, led by the haunted brain of Jamie Stewart has released one of their best albums this year- 13” Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips. It presented no stopping of the experimentation and passion of the group. The song off that album, “Veneficium” mixes the chaos of progressive rock and the melodies of indie rock with their unique experimental edge to create a sound completely devoid of genre. Throughout the journey of the four-minute-long track, Jamie questions our own existence, fears, and realities. Taking the classic mix of ideas from existentialism and absurdism, blending it together, and throwing all that up onto the listeners. Perfect for those looking for something deeper within their listening experience.
“Punish” – Ethel Cain
Review by Sophia Veronsky
The horror starlet, Hayden Silas, with her persona Ethel Cain has a grip on the alternative music world with her dark and atmospheric themes of southern gothic and uses her immaculate storytelling to bring you into any world she creates. Her first album, Preachers Daughter had a story throughout, her next project- “Perverts” is not connected to the story told in that album. Coming off her new EP, and now officially released- “Punish” is a masterclass of minimalism, stripping back of her usual firework of sound, with just a simple piano, letting the space of her poetry fill you in. Crying like the creaking sound of a swing, with a six-minute haunting melody of the harms and horrors of love and what it does to her mind and soul. This is what music is about in its most raw, and naked core. If you haven’t listened to Ethel Cain, this is the time to jump on the bandwagon because there is no one else like her.
“Blinding Faith” – Knocked Loose
Review By Jake Pino
ARF ARF! One of my favorite songs and records of this year came from Knocked Loose, which had the Metalcore and Hardcore scene in a chokehold with their third album, You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To, released in May. Blinding Faith was the lead single off of that record, and the minute it was released to the world, It had the metal and hardcore community at a standstill. From start to finish, the song was just pure anger and loud, punishing sounds that feel like your ears are taking a prime Mike Tyson punch. Although the band has been around for about a decade, they are finally getting the attention they deserve in the metal community and the mainstream realm. In November, they performed one of their newest singles, “Suffocate” feat. Poppy on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which was sick. As someone who has been a fan of the band for a few years, I find it amazing to of been able to see them grow and become more significant by the minute. This is only the beginning of what’s yet to come for the Kentucky natives.
“Routines in the Night ” – twenty one pilots
Review By Jake Pino 
Twenty One Pilots’ Clancy was one of the year’s most awaited and anticipated album releases. Released back in May, with lead singles “Overcompensate” “Backslide” and “The Craving.” Every single song on this album was fantastic and gave a throwback to OG Twenty One Pilots fans who have been with them since the beginning. One of my favorites off of that album is “Routines in the Night.” This song narrates how one struggles to fall asleep and stays in the maze of the mind. As someone who has had many sleepless nights, I find this song to be pretty relatable. This song is a bop during the day and during the night. It was also played live on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon back in September. 
“Walk With Me” – bôa 
Review by Arianna Arocho
“Walk With Me” was the first song bôa released in almost two decades. This is track number three on their newest album Whiplash. The album starts off with uncertainty in love until we get to “Walk With Me.” It shares a deep meaning and passion for loving someone and wanting them to be by your side. This song reached a lot of hearts as it talks about love and being vulnerable around loved ones. The vocals in this album are so angelic and soothing. Definitely one of my favorite releases of this year!
“Sickly Sweet” – NewDad 
Review by Arianna Arocho
NewDad’s first album MADRA has “Sickly Sweet” as track number two. The name speaks for the meaning of the song in a way. The song talks about going back to someone or something even though you know it’s bad for you. “Your garden is desolate / It’s full of disease / But I’ll have one more piece.” Also shows how boredom can sometimes make you make poor decisions. The vocals however are my favorite as it is so angelic and melancholy.
“Favourite” – Fontaines D.C. 
Review by Arianna Arocho
Fontaines D.C. really came back this year with their newest album Romance! “Favourite” is the last track on the album and it holds a special meaning to the band. The song talks about the band members’ youth and reminiscing on their past. This is my favorite song on the album and also the band’s favorite song to date! When listening to this song it almost feels nostalgic and airy. Something that can make you feel young again and just dance around!
“Take a Bite” – Beabadoobee
Review by Mia Savidge
This song is like walking through a park at dusk on a crisp autumn night. The vibes that are brought by its fresh melody and lyrics are like no other. I remember first hearing “Take a Bite” earlier this year and it was instantly on repeat for me. I love how descriptive the lyrics are which really transports you into the world of the song. The meaning behind the lyrics provides an interesting awareness of looking within oneself and recognizing how our habits and actions could have an undesired effect. Overall, Beabadoobee’s “Take a Bite” delivers not only with an extremely catchy melody but also on a deeper level helping convey a powerful message. 
“Heavy Is the Crown” – Linkin Park
Review by Danny Ortiz
Linkin Park’s “Heavy Is the Crown” is a sonic bridge between past and future, where raw nu-metal riffs meet modern production. With Emily Armstrong’s intense vocals complementing Mike Shinoda’s rap delivery, the song wrestles with themes of resilience and responsibility, encapsulating the weight of personal and collective burdens. It’s a fiery anthem that pays homage to the band’s roots while boldly stepping into new territory, making it both nostalgic and refreshingly current. Overall, “Heavy Is the Crown” is a standout track that balances innovation with homage, offering both long-time fans and new listeners a powerful listening experience. For those eager to hear how Linkin Park navigates this new chapter, this song is a testament to their enduring legacy.
“Summer” – Good Kid
Review by Danny Ortiz
Good Kid’s “Summer” feels like a warm breeze of nostalgia and self-reflection. With its infectious indie-rock rhythm and a chorus that insists, “This can’t be the end,” the song captures the bittersweet joy of holding on to fleeting moments. Inspired by stepping out after a long winter—literal or emotional—it’s an anthem about resilience, hope, and piecing yourself back together. Both catchy and introspective, “Summer” is a perfect soundtrack for those sunlit days you never want to forget.
“Vertigo” – Beach Bunny
Review by Danny Ortiz
Beach Bunny’s “Vertigo” is a whirlwind of raw emotion wrapped in upbeat pop-punk energy. Written mid-flight and fueled by themes of self-sabotage and jealousy, it captures the messy beauty of spiraling thoughts with an unexpectedly empowering edge. Lili Trifilio’s lyrics navigate vulnerability and self-awareness, all while backed by punchy guitar riffs and infectious melodies. It’s a relatable anthem for anyone learning to embrace their imperfections, one turbulent thought at a time.
“Die With A Smile” – Bruno Mars & Lady Gaga
Review by Sola Fide Johnson
The early 2010s were filled with dramatic, emotional, and heart-wrenching Bruno Mars medleys. That was something I liked about him. While I love a man who can sing Smooth Soul and RM, I do miss that emotional soft pop I had grown up hearing from him. Also as a Filipina, I know that the fellow Filipino pop star has always been popular at family karaoke. The moment I heard this song, I knew it would take a storm at all the Filipino karaoke parties. 
Short n’ Sweet – Sabrina Carpenter
Review by Sola Fide Johnson
This year has been a huge year for Sabrina Carpenter. She has become a viral icon, owned the summer, and dazzled millions of people all over the world. But while she may seem like a new star to most of the world, I have been a fan of hers since 2015. I have seen her music evolve from music that can be played on the Disney channel to age-restricted concerts. Her album Short n’ Sweet has made her growth into adulthood especially apparent. The album is full of great bangers such as “Espresso”, “Bed Chem” and “Juno.” Although I am not a big fan of country music, I appreciate how this pop album had a sort of country tinge in some of the songs. Her song “Please Please Please” was my most listened song this year. 
“You Need Me Now” – girl in red feat. Sabrina Carpenter*
Review by Sola Fide Johnson
This song is a fun bop that touches on vulnerability, intimacy, and emotional dependence. By featuring Sabrina Carpenter in this song it added a smooth, polished pop sound that greatly contrasted Girl In Red’s more raspy and Indie-style timbre. Even the elements each artist brought to the song displayed a beautiful contrast in their individual styles. Girl In Red’s segments convey a sense of urgency and emotional intensity. It also highlighted the vulnerability in the song. While Sabrina Carpenter’s segments were more refined and catchy, she seemed to radiate more confidence. This is very reflective of their style of music. 
“Field of Vision” – King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
Review by Erendira Benyo
Neo-psychedelic Australian rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard released their 26th studio album, Flight B741, back in August of this year. This album brings a brand new twist on their signature blues rock and boogie sound – a genre they’ve explored in the past. This time around, they embraced the jam-session vibe, focusing on raw, spontaneous rhythms, often recording with minimal prep. One track that stands out is “Field of Vision.” It encompasses a 60’s and 70’s rock groove, with a sprinkle of American southern twang. The distorted guitar riffs combined with soulful, brassy harmonica melodies add a rich texture that defines this song’s essence. What’s worth noting here, is that all six members are credited as writers of this song, a shift from their usual songwriting approach. And towards the end of this track, all the members chant, “I’m being a silly billy!” This playful lyric quickly turned into a fan-favorite meme. Overall, “Field of Vision” is a fun, laid-back ride through King Gizzard’s continuously transforming sound.
“Black Lung” – Pond
Review by Erendira Benyo
Eclectic psych-rock group Pond released their tenth album, Stung! in June of this year. While this album explores surreal psych-pop sounds, I’d like to put a spotlight on the track titled, “Black Lung.” The deep synths and fiery guitar create an atmosphere reminiscent of Tame Impala mixed with a bit of Black Sabbath, all while having you feeling like you’re floating amongst the stars in space. But once Nick Allbrook’s piercing vocals take over, the song becomes distinctly Pond – raw, energetic, and gripping. ”Black Lung” balances a dreamy soundscape with distorted motifs, a bold step forward in Pond’s musical journey.
“Resilience” – GUM
Review by Erendira Benyo
GUM (aka Jay Watson of Tame Impala and Pond) has released a collaborative album with Ambrose Kenny-Smith, a member of King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. This is the first album they have released as co-producers, and it is a treat for the ears. Watson and Kenny-Smith bring their distinctive musical styles to the table, swirling them seamlessly into one groovy album. A standout track, “Resilience,” kicks things off with funky keys, followed by a reverberating harmonica, which echoes its melody in a cheeky call-and-response. The rest of the instruments blend in, adding to the funky, twangy vibe. The album as a whole is like a gold mine, with each song diving into a different theme while staying true to the psychedelic funk-infused foundation.
“If Our Love Is Dead” – Royel Otis
Review by Ming-Jing Qin
I was first introduced to Royel Otis after stumbling upon their cover of Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Murder on the Dancefloor. An electrifying rendition of the song that well deserves its seven million views. But the duo is much more than an inventive cover band. This year they released their debut album PRATTS & PAIN, a perfect embodiment of their budding creative genius. However, it is their latest single, “If Our Love is Dead,” that in my opinion already stands out as an instant classic in the alt/indie rock catalog. Royel Maddell’s opening electric guitar riff sets the tone for a song that simultaneously captures the melancholy and magnetic energy of lost teenage years. Layered with Otis Pavlovic’s deep-hitting vocals, Royal Otis transcends you for the next three minutes into a dreamlike dimension where anything feels possible. Closing my eyes I can easily imagine the song playing in an early 2010s coming-of-age film.
“In The Living Room” – Maggie Rogers
Review by Ming-Jing Qin 
As a longtime fan of Maggie Rogers, I relish the soft vocals and acoustic instrumentation of her Alaska era. Safe to say I was brilliantly surprised when she released “In The Living Room” a couple of months ago. The new single has brought fresh life to her voice and music, with its
catchy alternative guitar riffs and striking vocals. It’s refreshing to hear her full-force choruses in a song that aches to be blasted through car speakers. “In The Living Room” is built for a live band and tugs at a soft spot I have for music that prioritizes live performance over digital studio compositions.
“Nowhere To Run” – Kings of Leon
Review by Ming-Jing Qin
“Nowhere To Run” off of King of Leon’s 2024 album Can We Please Have Fun struck me first because of its pulled-back bass line that grooves through an unquestionably danceable chorus. And as always, there is nothing quite like lead singer Caleb Followill’s vocals. The whole album is definitely worth a top-to-bottom listen and will slowly draw anyone back into a Kings of Leon addiction, that is if they ever left to begin with. The album proves the band has not exhausted its creative capabilities and is more than ever here to stay. Its title is incredibly fitting for a band that just wants to have fun now after establishing itself as an anthem of early 2000s alt-rock.
“I Look Alive” – Phoneboy
Review by Genevieve Cai
My favorite alt/indie band from Hoboken Phoneboy’s “I Look Alive” is definitely one of my top five favorite songs of the year (and not just because I got to be in the music video, subtle flex). It’s a super relatable and catchy song about pretending to be okay in social settings while dealing with inner conflict, but it is not at all sad sonically; a nice synth-y intro, a danceable drum beat, and earnest vocal blend of the different members are paired with its fun, zombie prom-themed music video. “I Look Alive” also marks a very important and fresh new era in Phoneboy’s music as Jordan Torres (their keyboardist) shines as the featured vocals for the first time! It is also their newest release since their 2023 album Moving Out. Lovingly dubbed “Miss Phoneboy” by the fans, Jordan is shown in the MV being crowned the queen of all the zombie prom-goers and jamming out with the rest of the beloved band members Ricky, Wyn, and James. It was extremely special hearing the live debut of this song at Phoneboy’s Halloween show at Brooklyn Made since everybody was all dressed up again.
“Where Blue Light Blooms” – Origami Angel
Review by Genevieve Cai
Off of their album Feeling Not Found, which came out in September, “Where Blue Light Blooms” by Origami Angel blends so many elements of a perfect song for me: relatability, an energetic style, and catchiness while still sounding unique. The punchy drums that start the song off drew me in right away, and the almost dichotomous, jingly guitar during the slower parts of the song as well as what becomes a more grinding guitar later on is also so satisfying. The chorus is the exact genre I call “upbeat sadness”, which I think very much comes from their Midwest emo traits. Vocalist Ryland invents an incredibly vibrant melody as he says: “It feels like I’ve been underground for this whole year / Just waiting for the sun to reappear / But now I see the distant glow / I think I’m feeling higher in a place that’s low.” I was lucky enough to hear this song as well as some others of the album when Gami had a signing event celebrating its release. #Gami Gang!
“A Lifetime in the Service of Darkness” – Ashbury Heights feat. Ulrike Goldmann
Review by Aidan Ivers
The electro-darkwave scene was gifted a timely collaboration this year with “A Lifetime in the Service of Darkness” by Swedish duo Ashbury Heights featuring Ulrike Goldmann. Off their 2024 record The Ghost House Sessions, Vol.1, the expertise of Anders Hagström, Yasmine “Yaz” Uhline, and Goldmann are on display. The three artists coming together for this piece add a unique element to the record amongst various other collaborations. The song is filled with tenebrous imagery, yet it “…invites one to let loose and embrace the good times in black, both the ones in the past and those still to come.” Goldmann has been the frontwoman for dark-electronic band Blutengel since 2005, and she shines throughout the piece signifying the strong partnership between the bands as they’ve evolved in the industry. They have collaborated in the past, and this was just more icing on a delightful darkwave treat. 
Version 1.0.0
“Top 10 Statues tHat Cried Blood” – Bring Me The Horizon 
Review by Alyssa Arroyo
2024 was an amazing year for metal. The one album that has stood out to me since it was released back in May has been POST HUMAN: NeX GEn by Bring Me The Horizon. Specifically the song, “Top 10 Statues tHat Cried Blood” has by far been one of my favorite songs off the entire record. Something that I really appreciate when it comes to new releases in metal music is taking chances and experimenting. Whether it is slightly bending the genre as a whole or collaborating with different musicians, metal has so much to offer and it is always appreciated when artists take risks. “Top 10 Statues…” is a great example of BMTH being that band unafraid of limits as this song is insanely dynamic. My favorite part of the track is definitely the chorus when a sound drops between the lyrics “ No one’s gonna come and rescue me.” From the heavy guitar features, hard-hitting drum sections, and strange tech sounds added, this song truly has it all. The cult concept of the album as a whole was very interesting for me as a listener, and with this song expanding that idea further captivated my attention wholeheartedly. 
“LALALALA (Rock Ver.)” – Stray Kids
Review by Ash Schnoor
My number one alternative song of 2024 is “LALALALA (Rock Ver.)” by Stray Kids. I had a little bit of a tough time picking a song since a lot of the music I like isn’t even bordering the alternative genre, but I came across this while searching through my top songs of the year on Spotify. Honestly I just really like Stray Kids. I could yap about them for hours and hours. But I shall not, for your sake of course. I chose this song because it’s honestly just a really fun song. The normal version is good but something about the rock version is just very *chef’s kiss*. Stray Kids is my favorite K-pop group & I actually have the absolute honor of seeing them in concert next summer so trust there will be a review. But back to the music – I love how just…heavy the instrumentals are, yet somehow not overpowering at all. They are simply so heavy while letting the vocals shine in such a magical way. This song is a wonderful gateway into K-rock, and if this interests you I’d look into other groups such as Dreamcatcher, Xdinary Heroes, and The Rose. That’s all I have for this year, I shall see you 365 days in the future. XOXO, gossip girl.
“Taste” – Daisy Grenade*
Review by Ash Schnoor
PUNK GOES POP IS BACK!!! YIPPEEEEE!! But for real, Daisy Grenade popped off with this cover of “Taste,” originally by Sabrina Carpenter. The original song is such a classic pop song, but Daisy Grenade does such a good job with their rendition. It is such an amazing blend of pop-punk, alternative, and all-around just amazing feminine vibes! Daisy Grenade is a recent discovery of mine, but I absolutely love them. But their cover of Taste has been one of the best covers I’ve heard this year – and I hope you enjoy it too! 🙂
“Search & destroy” – ericdoa
Review by Tina Mell
“Search & destroy” has genuinely been on repeat for me since the day it came out. Eric ALWAYS delivers and is one of my favorite artists of all time. The hook is always in my head and the beat keeps that hyper pop vibe but is completely evolved from what he has made in the past. He made this song on his “Locked In” livestream where he locked himself in the studio for two weeks until he finished his most recent project. Seeing this song come to life has been amazing and I can’t wait for him to come back to the US and get my rib bruised again from the barricade which was totally worth it.
“Radiant” – Real Friends 
Review by Amber Bintliff
Blue Hour was hands down my favorite album of this year. The album marks Real Friends’ first full-length release with lead singer Cody Muraro and their first release as an independent band. “Radiant” feels like the perfect embodiment of this new era for the band. The song explores themes of rebirth and wanting to start over after a rough patch. It has that classic emotional and cathartic sound that Real Friends is known for, which is one of the many reasons why “Radiant” has entered my top three favorite songs from them. 
“Whenever You’re Ready” – Alpha Wolf
Review by Amber Bintliff
Half Living Things, the third studio album by Australian metalcore band Alpha Wolf, was one of the best metalcore albums of 2024 (you can fight me on this… I might win). After seeing them live in October, I have been painfully obsessed with this record, especially “Whenever You’re Ready.” It’s intense, brooding, and full of anthemic screaming. What more could you ask for? The four minutes and 13 seconds that “Whenever You’re Ready” plays for is enough time for one to realize how massively talented Alpha Wolf is. Hopefully, 2025 will see them come back to the states so I can get thrown around in a mosh pit to this song and many more. 
“Sobering” – State Champs
Review by Amber Bintliff
If 2024 was the year of anything, it was pop-punk and self-titled albums. Funnily enough, one of my favorite records of the year was New York pop-punk icons State Champs’ self-titled fifth album. It’s extremely hard for me to pick just one favorite from this, but “Sobering” has been climbing its way to the top. This song is easily recognizable as a classic-sounding State Champs song but with a fun, fresh twist. They’ve created such an authentically fantastic-sounding album and are carrying the pop-punk genre on their backs like they’ve been since 2010. 
“PLAYLIST of DOOM” – Robert DeLong
Review by Emily “Emol” McCormack
The title track of Robert DeLong’s 2024 album PLAYLIST of DOOM brings a smile to my face every time I listen to it. It reminds me a bit of the Pet Shop Boys meets Love And Rockets. I have been a fan of his since 2018, gravitating towards his hit “Favorite Color Is Blue” feat. K.Flay quite simply because– My favorite color is also blue! I am also stunned each time I hear his song in the Applebee’s near campus (“This is Robert DeLong!” “That’s great, Emol- Your food is ready.”) I was ecstatic to see that DeLong was releasing another album this year. Though it’s a bit dancier than some other music I listen to on a daily basis, it’s been a fun addition to my daily rotation of tunes. Though I love the whole album, “PLAYLIST of DOOM” is a standout to me because of the relatable lyrics. Sure, I may sound like I’m saying “I’m not like other girls” when I explain this, but I often feel like the songs I play when I have control of the aux in a car are a playlist of doom to some other people… DeLong sings “No one else likes the things we like / Put it on when the mood feels right / Really know how to clear a room / When we put on our playlist of doom.” Sometimes certain music isn’t always right for the occasion, but if others can’t handle your playlist curation and music taste, then let them clear the room. Listen to your playlist of doom! Other notable tracks on the album: “Headrush,” “Sweet Talker,” and “Fatal Flaw (Livin’? Alright!).”

“Here’s To The Years” – Jeris Johnson
Review by Emily “Emol” McCormack
Jeris Johnson is my favorite new music discovery of 2024. I had the pleasure of seeing him on Kim Dracula’s tour in the spring, and I have been listening to him every day since (this is not an exaggeration, just ask my Spotify wrapped.) His debut album Dragonborn released in August and is full of upbeat tracks. He mixes sounds typical of metal with electronic, elements of rock with pop – and most unique to my playlists, this epic medieval sound that ties everything together (I have never heard the genre “bardcore” before this man, and it is so incredible). This is one of the few albums I downloaded on my flight to Seattle in the Fall (I didn’t download nearly enough music to span six hours…), so needless to say I became very familiar with this album front to back (and front to back again) very quickly. While this album is outstanding from start to finish, if I had to pick just one standout it would be his single “Here’s To The Years.” It makes me feel nostalgic for a time I wasn’t around for, I just want to get up and dance with all my bard homies. I can’t wait to see all that Johnson does in the future – Here’s to the year 2024!
