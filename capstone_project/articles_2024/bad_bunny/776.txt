Hello Nightly!!!
Tonight, we take a look at Backlash 2023, from Puerto Rico!
Bianca Belair vs. Iyo Sky for the WWE Raw Women’s Championship:
Solid match.
Seth Rollins vs. Omos:
About what I expected, could have been worse.
Austin Theory vs. Bronson Reed vs. Bobby Lashley for the WWE United States Championship:
Secent triple threat, but never quite got going.
Rhea Ripley vs. Zelina Vega for the WWE SmackDown Women’s Championship:
Really good match with a standout performance from Zelina, who repped Puerto Rico. If only the company actually did anything with her after this.
Bad Bunny vs. Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight:
Really fun match, had good pacing, just the right amount of overbooking, Bad Bunny held his own, this was a great match.
Bloodline vs. Matt Riddle, Sami Zayn, and Kevin Owens:
Really good tag match.
Brock Lesnar vs. Cody Rhodes:
Not a bad match, but this felt rushed, Brock bled for some reason, and did not feel like a main event compared to some of the other matches on the card.
Overall, while not an amazing show, the good stuff on this show was very good. Easily the best Backlash since 2016. The Puerto Rico crowd being fired up all show also helped this show a lot.
On to the Nightly.
