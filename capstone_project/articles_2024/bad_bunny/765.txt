STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Another new episode of “Saturday Night Live” is in the works, but fans will have to wait to see it.
On March 30, the late-night staple will welcome comedian and actor Ramy Youssef for his debut as host with Travis Scott as the musical guest.
Youssef, a versatile talent, starred in the 2023 Academy Award-nominated film “Poor Things,” portraying the role of the impressionable doctor Max McCandles alongside Emma Stone’s Bella Baxter. 
He also created and stars in “Ramy,” a comedy series on Hulu. Inspired by his own life as an Egyptian-American in a New Jersey Muslim community, the show has received a ton of praise. In 2020, Youssef earned two Emmy nominations and won a Golden Globe for his role as lead actor in the series.
Scott is a world-known Grammy-nominated rapper who recently dropped a new album, “Utopia.” This marks his second appearance as the musical guest on “SNL”; he also appeared alongside host Awkwafina in October 2018.

“Saturday Night Live” — now in its 49th season — returned with new episodes in mid-October. And, in typical “SNL” fashion, the long-running show brought in a very special guest for its season premiere on Oct. 14: Pete Davidson, the born-and-raised Staten Islander who joined “SNL” in 2014 at the ripe age of 20, and bowed out at the end of Season 47. Ice Spice was the musical guest.

On Nov. 18, Jason Momoa returned to “SNL” to host for the second time. Tate McRae made her debut as a musical guest.

On Dec. 16, former “Saturday Night Live” superstar Kate McKinnon returned to Studio 8H for the first time since her exit from the show in 2022 at the end of Season 47.
