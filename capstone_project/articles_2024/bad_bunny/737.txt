I can’t wait to go to NXT next week yall I might RKO somebody 😭😭 @WWE #nxt

	No one really knew if she was trolling or not, so we had to wait for WWE to confirm, which it did on last night’s WWE NXT show on USA:
Yall ready?? @WWENXT @WWE 🤭 pic.twitter.com/WlkLmXJ7Qj

	Sexyy and her fans seem hype too, with one X user calling her Sexyy Orton:
Sexyy Orton 🤣🔥 https://t.co/YLFPvsR5cB

	Her music is no stranger to the wrestling world. Last year, wrestler Jey Uso used her hit “SkeeYee” as a walk-up song and, in turn, spurred this interesting partnership.
I wanna see this happen Fr 😭😭😭 @WWE when yal gonna invite me? https://t.co/Q1MK0JceIB

	According to the WWE, Sexyy Red is “a lifelong WWE fan.” Backing up that claim are a bunch of posts across social media, like when she took to X to comment on wrestler Trick Williams and his feud with the Meta-Four stable:
Mannnn wtf I just watch on Supernova Sessions? MetaFour betta watch dey back cause Trick Williams gon be on dey ass now!! 😭😭

	Hip-hop has been intertwined with pro wrestling since the ’80s when Run-DMC performed at Wrestlemania V in 1989. A slew of rappers have also made appearances in and outside of the ring like Ice-T, Bad Bunny and Salt-N-Pepa, to name a few. And rappers like Westside Gunn, Action Bronson and Wale frequently make wrestling references in their music, with the latter going as far as to host a yearly wrestling event called WaleMania.

	Big Sexyy will be on NXT, live next Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET, on the USA Network.
