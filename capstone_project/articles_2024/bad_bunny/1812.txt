The official diamond award was unveiled by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1999. In the years since then, it has been bestowed sparingly — only if a song has moved at least 10 million equivalent units by combining sales and streaming numbers.
Crucially, an artist or label must also request certification through an application process, which can lead to a delay in updated sales figures.
