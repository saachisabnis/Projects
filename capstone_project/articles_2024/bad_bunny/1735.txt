Songs from some of the world’s biggest artists have begun disappearing from TikTok following a falling out between the social media platform and Universal Music Group.
Stars such as Billie Eilish, Drake and Kendrick Lamar are among those whose music will no longer be available. Taylor Swift’s own videos, from her account, have even been muted.
Existing videos now include a notice saying the sound has been removed due to copyright restrictions.
Until yesterday, Universal Music Group currently allowed TikTok users to add songs by its artists to their videos, helping promote new talent, make big stars bigger and, in the case of Murder On The Dancefloor, revive older hits.
However, Universall accused the platform of ‘bullying’ over its licence fees, meaning millions of songs could disappear from TikTok when the clock strikes midnight.
Universal said TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, was trying to pay a much lower rate for its entire back catalogue than other social media platforms.
In response, TikTok accused Universal of ‘putting their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters’.
The current contract expires at midnight, meaning if a deal is not struck, artists including The Beatles, Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, Elton John and Bob Dylan will disappear from TikTok.

An open letter posted by Universal highlighted the importance of music to TikTok, yet added the income contributed just 1% of the record label’s revenue.
‘Its senior executives proudly state publicly that “music is at the heart of the TikTok experience” and our analysis confirms that the majority of content on TikTok contains music, more than any other major social platform,’ it wrote.
‘Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music.’
In a short statement on its website, TikTok said Universal was pushing a ‘false narrative and rhetoric’.
‘TikTok has been able to reach “artist-first” agreements with every other label and publisher,’ it said. ‘Clearly, Universal’s self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.’
However, it is not only money causing the rift.
Universal also raised the spectre of artificial intelligence in its letter, stating that TikTok was ‘allowing the platform to be flooded with AI-generated recordings’.
It said the company was also developing tools to ‘enable, promote and encourage AI music creation on the platform itself’, diluting the royalty pool for human artists – ‘a move that is nothing short of sponsoring artist replacement by AI’.
The scathing letter also slammed TikTok’s response to dangerous content on the platform.
TikTok did not address any points raised in Universal’s statement beyond the pay deal.
Universal claimed that when it raised the issues directly with TikTok, it was met ‘first with indifference, and then with intimidation’, as the platform began ‘selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.’
With a resolution unable to be reached, the split has begun, and TikTok sounds very different today.
