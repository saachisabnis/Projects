Since her first Met Gala in 2015, Zendaya has become a staple at the annual ball. 
The actress delivers drama at each Met she graces with the use of textures, prints and colors. She doesn’t shy away from boundary-pushing silhouettes and effortlessly modernizes dated aesthetics. 
Zendaya also perfectly complements her ensembles by playing up her glam. She’s blessed Us with teased extensions, wet hair, bowl cuts and more. 
After attending the gala back to back for several years, she took a break in 2019 to focus on her various film projects. In February 2024, Vogue announced Zendaya’s return to fashion’s biggest night as a co-chair alongside Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Wintour.
