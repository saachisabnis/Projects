Midway through 2024, Madonna’s Celebration Tour is the highest-grossing worldwide tour of the year thus far.  Pollstar’s mid-year report finds that Madonna’s Celebration Tour grossed an average of $2,794,007 for each of her 65 shows, making for a total gross of $178.8 million for the Material Girl’s entire tour. Bad Bunny is No. 2 with $174.6 million from his Most Wanted Tour, followed by Luis Miguel at No.3 with $169.4 million, U2’s Las Vegas Sphere residency ranks at No. 4 with $135 million, and Karol G is No. 5 with $111 million. Pollstar‘s report finds that after three years of record-setting ticket sales tied to a post-pandemic touring boom, live music’s growth has evened out in 2024, with no noticeable surges or declines compared to the past few years. Those findings are slightly skewed, however, because Taylor Swift’s record-setting The Eras Tour does not report its tour figures to Pollstar. (Variety)
