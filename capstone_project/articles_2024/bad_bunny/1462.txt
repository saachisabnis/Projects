So, if you’re looking to score some of the best adidas pieces for a fraction of the price, get your wallets out because there’s no better time than now to start saving big. Ahead, we break down the best adidas Black Friday deals, available to shop exclusively at adidas.com.
Die-hard fans of adidas know two things — the brand is the only destination for beautifully designed sportswear with something for everyone, and each year, its Black Friday deals go above and beyond the prior year’s. It’s a one-stop shop to pick up amazing gifts for sneakerheads at a discount or stock up on a new pair of the best adidas running shoes.
While many other retailers that host Black Friday sales offer adidas shoes, clothing, and accessories at discounted prices, there’s a benefit to shopping directly from adidas.com. For starters, shoppers are the first to shop adidas Black Friday drops of any new adidas clothing and sneakers. If you’re an adidas Creators Club member, you’ll get access to the most savings, potentially up 70 percent off nearly the entire site, as well as guaranteed free and speedy shipping, and easy returns including full refunds within 30 days of purchase.
