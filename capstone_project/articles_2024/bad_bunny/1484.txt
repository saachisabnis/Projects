 It seems like smooth sailing into the New Year for Hailey Baldwin Bieber.

 The model, 27, posted a series of photos on her Instagram on Thursday, showing off her tropical Barbados vacation where she rang in the new year. In several of the snaps, Bieber is enjoying the sun on a boat.

 “2024… I’m along for the ride 🤪,” she captioned it.

 The first photo shows the Rhode skincare founder wearing a long white dress with her hair in a bun as she stands on the sand as the sun is setting.

 The next is much more casual, with Bieber’s hair wrapped in a towel — highlighting her makeup-free face — and a pair of shorts hanging out of her bag as she exits the ocean.

 The following several images put her figure on display, as she poses wearing a skimpy green bikini and a straw bucket hat.

 In one picture, Bieber is turned around, showing a cheeky display of her tan figure.

 Bieber’s close friend and fellow model Kendall Jenner also posted images taken on the beach, where they vacationed together. In her post, Jenner, 28, posed next to Bieber in a long sheer Helsa gown — leaving little up to the imagination — as the pair stood oceanside.

 “years pass, and they seem faster and faster. presence and time is all i can ask for,” the caption began, reflecting on 2023. “so grateful for what has past, so optimistic for what’s to come. go love on the people you hold close to your heart, and don’t waste a second ❤️.”

 She concluded: “2024, shower me with love and laughter, gratitude and growth, patience and presence.”

 Sources told PEOPLE on Wednesday that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum's ex, Bad Bunny, and Bieber’s husband Justin Bieber were also on the trip.
