Karol G has officially received not one but two of her very own wax figures at the renowned Madame Tussauds wax museum.

	The Colombian artist was present at the recent grand reveal in New York City, where she reacted to her two figures: one that captures the Colombian-inspired outfit and signature blue hair that she rocked during her 2022 Coachella performance; the other is one of her looks from the “TQG” music video with Shakira, where she had her striking red locks.

	“Wow, how impressive!” Karol said in a press statement. “My first impression was I love my smile, and the color of my eyes […] I hope when my fans meet the figures that it’s a manifestation for them that one day they will meet me.”

	“Karol G is one of our generation’s greatest living Latina performers,” added Eliza Rose, marketing manager at Madame Tussauds New York. “Her figure is a beautiful addition to our museums, and a testament to her talent, influence and the love her fans have for her.”

	The “Bichota” singer—who’s a 17-time finalist at the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Awards and whose “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido” has spent 12 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart—joins Maluma, Anitta, Selena, Bad Bunny, Shakira and other Latin acts with their own wax figures.
