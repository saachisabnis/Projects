As she arrived at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center, the girlfriend to tennis player Taylor Fritz was spotted wearing a light gray set that was composed of a mini skirt and a blazer which featured raw hemming and a black button down closure. The jacket was paired with a white collared shirt and a light gray checkered tie. She accessorized with a black leather handbag, a tennis bracelet and a pair of diamond studs.
Along with white crew socks, Riddle completed the look with a pair of white Stuart Weitzman pumps. The heels featured a satin upper that slimmed into a pointed toe. The chic set was supported by a stiletto heel that was about 4 inches tall. Although this colorway is no longer available, this style is available in other finishes, which retail for $495.
