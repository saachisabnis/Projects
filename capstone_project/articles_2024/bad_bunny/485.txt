Myke Towers earns his second No. 1 on Billboard’s Tropical Airplay chart as “La Capi” jumps 2-1 to lead the May 18-dated list. It’s the second ruler on the radio ranking for Towers, who first crowned the list through “Travesuras” in 2021. While the Puerto Rican picks up his second No. 1 with his second entry, he’s notched 30 titles on the Latin Rhythm Airplay ranking, including 11 No. 1s.

	“La Capi,” released Nov. 23, is one of 23 songs on Towers’ LVEU: Vive La Tuya…No La Mía album, which debuted at No. 9 on Top Latin Albums (December 2023). The song launched at No. 7 on Tropical Airplay in March and completes a steady climb to the summit in its eighth week, with 9.17 million audience impressions, up 49% on U.S. reporting radio stations during the May 3-9 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The song’s eight-week trek to the penthouse bests Towers’ preceding ruler: “Travesuras,” with Nio García, Casper Mágico, Ozuna, Wisin & Yandel, Myke Towers and Flow La Movie, wrapped a 17-week journey to in March 2021.

	With “La Capi” ascending to the summit on Tropical Airplay, Towers joins six other artists outside the genre who have secured a No. 1 through a collab or as soloists in the last year.

	Here’s the recap of those winners dating back to May 6, 2023:

	“La Capi” also rallies 11-3 on the overall Latin Airplay chart, and gifts Towers his 13th top 10.

	Beyond its radio popularity, “La Capi” debuts at No. 45 on Hot Latin Songs, the airplay-, digital- and streaming-combined chart, despite a 2% decline in streaming activity, which translates to 145,000 official U.S. streams logged during the same period. The song joins two other Tower tracks on the multi-metric tally, “Adivino,” with Bad Bunny, which drops 2-4, and “La Falda” dips 15-19.
