When you take a deep dive into "Wizard of Oz'' trivia, it's amazing the legendary cast survived the filming.
As the Wicked Witch, Margaret Hamilton caught fire and suffered serious burns. Both she and other actors suffered skin issues from toxic makeup. As the Scarecrow, Ray Bolger had marks on his face for months due to facial prosthesis. And Judy Garland, who played Dorothy, allegedly was forced to lose weight and was slapped at one point for laughing on set.
But for 85 years, for movie fans, "The Wizard of Oz'' has been nothing but a wonderous, joyful, multi-colored ride (OK, except maybe for the flying monkeys!)
The American Film Institute has ranked "Wizard of Oz'' as the No. 6 top film on its 100 Movies ... 100 Years list.
“The Wizard of Oz” received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and won for Best Song (“Over the Rainbow”) and Best Original Score, as well as a special award for Outstanding Juvenile Performance by Judy Garland.
To mark its anniversary, Fathom Events’ Big Screen Classics begins with the 1939 fantasy, bringing it back to big screens nationwide on Sunday, Jan. 28; Monday, Jan. 29, and Wednesday, Jan. 31.
"The film was an overwhelmingly popular and critical success upon its initial release and proved its ability to continually captivate audiences when M-G-M reissued the film in 1949 and 1955,'' according to Fathom.
According to press materials, each screening of the "Wizard of the Oz'' includes "an exclusive introduction by acclaimed film critic and historian Leonard Maltin, shedding light on the groundbreaking film’s incredible legacy and lasting impact — both on cinema and pop culture.''
