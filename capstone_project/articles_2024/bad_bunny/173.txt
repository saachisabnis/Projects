Latinos have been shaping the cultural landscape globally, showcasing their talent and influence across film, TV, and music. As we look at the influential figures leading this movement, their roots and contributions stand out more than ever.
Late last year, USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative shared that “Hispanic/Latino representation in film has not improved in 16 years.” This comes after years of advocacy groups highlighting the Latino demographic’s growing consumer and cultural influence. Despite these longstanding conversations, the impact of the Latino community is undeniable: It contributes trillions to the national GDP and makes significant strides in the global cultural landscape.
In 2023, Latin music generated $1.4 billion in revenue, proving that language barriers are minimal regarding artistic expression. Latino moviegoers accounted for 29% of ticket sales, reflecting their substantial role in the entertainment industry. According to Nielsen, Latinos consume around nine hours of community time daily, underscoring their engagement and influence.
