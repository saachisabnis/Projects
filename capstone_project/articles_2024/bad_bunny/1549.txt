Green Day and Keurig have teamed up and made a punk rock coffee machine! This is definitely the most punk way to start a morning.
You may be familiar with Green Day's hit, "Wake Me Up When September Ends." Now, you'll have help waking up any month of the year with a new coffee machine from Green Day and Keurig! The collaboration is happening to celebration the 20th anniversary of their "American Idiot" album.
This gives you a chance to enjoy your coffee like a rock star. The Keurig is red and black and features some of the band's song lyrics along with the iconic red grenade heart seen on the album cover. However, it's not just the machine, it comes with a lot more!
According to Food & Wine, the machine from Green Day and Keurig also comes with Punk Bunny Coffee K-Cup pods and a Green Day-branded tumbler. Additionally, it comes with exclusive access to a Spotify playlist personally curated by the band! That's a pretty sweet deal, especially if you're a fan! It gives you some exclusivity that's sure to make your friends bitter and jealous. The unique coffee machine will reportedly be available starting on August 20th and can be purchased for $159.99 at Keurig.com.
Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, said in a statement shared to Food & Wine, "We are on the road celebrating 20 years of American Idiot all summer. Our buses and back stages have been stocked with our coffee company's first-ever signature brewer. Now, we can finally announce this release and hope you guys love it as much as we do." Not a bad idea to get into the coffee game! Pretty much everybody consumes coffee, or at least a majority. That enables them to reach a wide market. I feel like it's a much better decision than creating a fragrance like so many companies are doing, like Auntie Anne's.
Green Day isn't the only one excited about the collaboration. Becky Opdyke, the senior vice president of coffee marketing at Keurig Dr. Pepper added, "What's impressive about Green Day is their unwavering passion for both their music and their coffee. After working closely with the band on our Punk Bunny partnership, we were inspired to design a brewer that embodies their enthusiasm and celebrates one of their biggest accomplishments. We're excited to deliver a piece of the band right to fans' kitchen counters," via Food & Wine.

Rolling Stone created some major buzz today (September 15) with the release of an updated version of their "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.
The first version of the list was released in 2004, a time when "...the iPod was relatively new, and Billie Eilish was three years old." With that in mind, Rolling Stone reached out to a wide variety of music figures, from artists to industry professionals to journalists, "to give the list a total reboot."
Rolling Stone notes, "Nearly 4,000 songs received votes. Where the 2004 version of the list was dominated by early rock and soul, the new edition contains more hip-hop, modern country, indie rock, Latin pop, reggae, and R&B. More than half the songs here — 254 in all — weren’t present on the old list, including a third of the Top 100. The result is a more expansive, inclusive vision of pop, music that keeps rewriting its history with every beat."
Of course, with that in mind, that means there are many songs from the 2004 version that are no longer on the 2021 version. Which tracks didn't make the cut this time around? Scroll below to view just 30 songs that are no longer on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list and where they ranked on the list in 2004.
