Chris Evans joined Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, and several other “Avengers” stars for a new video endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.
The nearly two-minute clip, shared on Ruffalo’s X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, also featured appearances by fellow Marvel movie stars Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, and Danai Gurira, assembling to offer a bit of superheroic support for Harris and running mate Tim Walz in the final days leading up to the 2024 US presidential election.

“Don’t sit this one out,” Ruffalo added to his video post on X. “It’s the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women’s reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines.”
“This [expletive] is real and it’s going to come for you,” he continued, while imploring his followers to take three friends with them to the polls. “Always give it all.”
In the video, Evans and his fellow “Avengers” stars hop on a call with Johansson to encourage viewers to vote on Tuesday. While assembling in support of Harris, the Marvel heroes also shared a few catch phrase ideas for her campaign.

“How about this, I’m just off the top of my head: I can do this all day,” said Evans, referencing the famous Captain America tag line. Unfortunately, that idea didn’t go over well with his costars, earning a “Shut up” from Downey Jr. and an “I hate it” from Cheadle.
After workshopping a few ideas, the actors landed on “I am down with democracy”; although Ruffalo pointed out that depending on the word emphasized, the intent might not sound “the way we want it to sound.” However, that didn’t stop the “Avengers” stars from delivering the line as heroic music played in the background.

This isn’t the first time that Evans has weighed in on politics, as the Sudbury native has been a frequent critic of former president Donald Trump on social media. Evans told the Hollywood Reporter in 2019 that he “might have to cut ties” with former Patriots star Tom Brady if the Super Bowl-winning quarterback continued supporting Trump.
As for Harris, the vice president has racked up a number of high-profile endorsements in the lead up to Election Day, including Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Leonardo DiCaprio, Eminem, and Bruce Springsteen.
