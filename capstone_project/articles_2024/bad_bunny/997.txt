iHeartMedia Tampa Bay has moved Rumba down the dial to a stronger signal. Formerly at 106.5 WRUB, the Contemporary Latin Hits station is now at home on 95.7 WBTP‘s 100,000-watt signal. WBTP previously carried Hip-Hop and R&B as The Beat.
The station’s lineup includes The Enrique Santos Show, Sarykarmen Rivera, Los Anormales, Rodolfo El Chamo, and Laura Laserna, with more local talent joining soon. Rumba 95.7 kicked off its new era by stunting a commercial-free lineup of hits from Latino artists like Bad Bunny, Feid, Karol G, and Marc Anthony.
As such, The Beat has traded places with Rumba, moving to 106.5/102.
iHeartLatino SVP of Programming P.J. Gonzalez said, “Rumba 95.7 will feature a special mix of music tailored specifically to the local Latino community in Tampa Bay. We’re also excited to have Enrique Santos hosting our morning show on a far superior signal, ensuring that his unique content reaches even more listeners.”
Rumba Program Director Super Martinez remarked, “I’m thrilled to provide our listeners with our brand Rumba and to become the largest Spanish-language station with the strongest signal in all of Tampa Bay.”
Division President Chris Soechtig added, “We are thrilled to expand coverage of Rumba 95.7 on a massive 100,000-Watt signal, in addition to being available across multiple platforms via the iHeartRadio app, dedicated to serving and celebrating the vibrant Latino community in Tampa Bay. This station will provide a platform for diverse voices, culture and music, and we are excited to foster stronger connections within our community.

This was a big mistake placing a latin music station over a Black American station.. America first!
Bug off MAGA fool….! Puerto Rico is America, dummy..!!!!
What about the segment of the community that would be enlighten and empowered by content on The Beat???
Timing couldn’t be worse…
Tampa has become quite competitive as far as Spanish Rhythmic that is the Rhumba format.   It gives it a signal that can compete with WYUU and Sol that has made some serious in roads.  So they didn’t want to be left behind.  As far as the priority of formats it boils down to revs and potential revs typically.   It’s been almost 10 years ago that I told the upper management I worked for at the radio group I was at that there was a room in that ‘playground’.   It was based on several factors and now iHeart, SBS , and Beasley are trying to get their portion of the Hispanic market revs.   It continues to grow.
Wow I woke up to no 95.7 the beat I hate it here
Typical.  The hip hop stations always get the short end of the stick.  This has happened in several radio markets across the country.  Hip hop listeners go from a clear 100,000 watt station to a crappy one.  Make it make sense iHeart Radio…SMH
Bring 95.7 BACK! All Latin music?! Isn’t it still America?! What the HELL, I can’t even listen to it. Sad just Sad
Of course it’s still America. And this is a format that’s very successful in many many markets. And I’ve never once tuned in the Polka station in Owatonna, Minnesota and wondered what happened to my country.
I was born in Puerto Rico and that’s America, Cynthia…… I love their music, Salsa..!!!!
