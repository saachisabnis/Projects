Jennifer Lopez will join Vice President Kamala Harris in Las Vegas for a presidential rally on Thursday, October 31.
J-Lo’s involvement follows Beyonce’s appearance last week at the Harris campaign rally in Houston. Kelly Rowland and Queen Bey’s mother, Tina Knowles, also attended the Texas rally. 
The event, which also featured a performance by the Latin rock band Maná, highlighted the significance of voting in this election cycle, with early voting in Nevada closing on November 1 and Election Day looming.
Lopez will take the stage to emphasize the power of the vote, discuss the issues at stake for the nation, and share why she endorses Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Her involvement adds star power to the campaign’s Get Out the Vote effort, aiming to energize voter turnout in these crucial final days.

On Sunday, Lopez posted on her Instagram story supporting Harris’s plan to revitalize Puerto Rico’s economy and rebuild its energy grid. Her post came amidst a backlash sparked by comedian Tony Hinchliffe, who, during Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, dismissed Puerto Rico as a “floating pile of garbage.” 
Harris directly responded to the remarks in a video shared by Bad Bunny, stating, “I will never forget what Donald Trump did—and didn’t do—when Puerto Rico needed a compassionate, competent leader. He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after devastating hurricanes, and offered nothing but paper towels and insults.” Lopez’s endorsement, amplified to her 45.6 million Instagram followers, aims to resonate deeply with those concerned about the U.S. government’s treatment of Puerto Rico.
Musician Ricky Martin shared a clip of Hinchliffe’s remark with a strong message: “This is what they think of us.” Singer Luis Fonsi also weighed in on social media, drawing attention to the incident and reinforcing the rallying call for Puerto Rican solidarity.
