Apple Music released its list of the 100 best albums of all time on Wednesday - and music fans are shocked by the results.
Lauryn Hill's 1998 solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill topped the list at No. 1, while Beyoncé was the only woman on the list to have two albums in the top 100.
Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) cracked the top 20 at No. 18, while the Eagles' Hotel California barely made the list at all, scraping in at No. 99.
More than 22% of the albums on the list were hip-hop/rap, making it the most represented genre in the top 100.
Rock was second, followed by alternative and pop, while country music made up just 1% of the albums.

'This is my award, but it's a rich, deep narrative, and involves so many people, and so much sacrifice, and so much time, and so much collective love,' Hill said in a statement
The sole country album on the list was Kacey Musgraves' Golden Hour.
Countless music fans on social media were outraged by the results, with many pointing out some of the pop titans that were snubbed. 
'So Apple Music made a list of 100 best albums of all time and didn't include any of Mariah Carey Whitney Houston and Brandy albums?' asked one.
'No Mariah Carey in the Apple top 100 albums list so far……. I know this stuff doesn't truly matter but people really play with her legacy,' wrote another.
'Apple's 100 Best Album's List is insane. The Fame Monster being No. 89 but 1989 being No. 18??? Are you joking me??? And it's Taylor's Version which isn't even as good as the original version,' raged another fan.
'The only country album in Apple Music's Top 100 Albums list is Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves? Bruh ain't no way…' wrote one. 
One music lover even complained that Beyoncé deserved a third entry on the list, despite the fact that her self-titled album ranked No. 36 while Lemonade was an impressive No. 10. 
'Beyoncé is the only female artist with TWO Albums in the Apple Music 100 Best Albums of All Time list….should have been AT LEAST three,' they posted to X.

In addition to Whitney and Mariah, other divas who were snubbed from the list include Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand.
Hip-hop icons like Nicki Minaj and Lil' Kim were also nowhere to be found, while country superstars like Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert and The Chicks were all missing.
A number of rock icons were snubbed too, including Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Queen, The Who, and Black Sabbath. 
Reacting to taking out the top spot, Fugees superstar Lauryn said, 'This is my award, but it's a rich, deep narrative, and involves so many people, and so much sacrifice, and so much time, and so much collective love.'
Music fans took to social media to the blast the ranking over some of the major snubs
The ranking was decided by Apple Music's editorial team of editors and music experts, which included radio hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden.
'This list isn't a popularity contest,' Darden said earlier this year, according to the Associated Press. 
'We challenged everyone to not vote based on your favorites. You're invited into the panel because you have music knowledge beyond what you listen to when you're on the elliptical machine.'
