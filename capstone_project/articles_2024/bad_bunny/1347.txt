The real question is, who wasn't at the Vogue World: Paris fashion show on June 23? The mega-production featured fashion's biggest names and celebrities, including two well-known names who nearly brought the house down. Models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid stunned the crowd when they came out on horseback during the star-studded affair. And people online are calling it true horse girl vibes.
It's well-known that both Kendall and Gigi are fans of horseback riding. But no one expected that they'd show up at the fashion event in full equestrian mode.
The magazine shared a clip of the two models making their grand entrance on TikTok. Unlike their normal catwalk strut, the besties hit the runway on horseback. The models were dressed in Hermés, as were their horses Django and Napo, who wore scarves from the legendary fashion brand. The two experienced riders trotted in front of the crowds at the Place Vendôme, but broke their usual stoic model faces to crack a smile at each other as they rode by. Not your typical day at the office we guess.

The comments section was seriously impressed with the models' skill. "Kendall cheesing 'cus [it's] her two passions combined," wrote one person. "When your childhood passion stayed alive throughout your career!! Ugh....I'm am sooooo happy to see this!!!" another commenter cheered. "Now show up at the Eras Tour and be so iconic," one person pleaded.
The model besties weren't the only spectacle at the fashion extravaganza, which celebrated the intersection of Paris fashion and sports. According to the New York Times, the event was previously held in New York and London, but this year was in Paris in honor of International Olympic Day. The show was meant to celebrate "100 years of French fashion and sport" between the last time Paris hosted the Olympics in 1924 and today.
Vogue World: Paris featured 180 unique looks and more than 150 models and celebrity performers. Celebrities in attendance were Maluma wearing Thom Brown. Sabrina Carpenter in a 1940s red and white Jacquemus dress. Katy Perry in a 1980s-style Noir Kei Ninomiya dress. Sisters Venus and Serena Williams were also there and stunned in Off-White and Marine Serre.
Rapper Bad Bunny and French-Malarian singer Aya Nakamura performed as models strutted around the space. Each decade represented a different time in French sports history and there was even an appearance from the French national cycling team.
It's all to say that this was the fashion event of the year. But we don't know who we were more excited to see — Kendall and Gigi or Django and Napo.
