It’s Bad Bunny ’s (Vogue) world, and we’re all just living in it.
Ahead of Vogue World 2024 in Paris, rumors began to swirl that Bad Bunny—who co-chaired the 2024 Met Gala—would make an appearance. And, lo! The superstar singer graced us with not one but three of his biggest hits in the latter part of the show.
Bad Bunny took over the Place Vendôme during the 1990s tribute to football, performing his bop “Monaco.” Then, singing “Vou 787,” he provided the foot-tapping soundtrack for runway turns from Venus and Serena Williams, who helped celebrate tennis and 2000s fashion. For the 2010s, breakdancers defied gravity to “Tití Me Preguntó.”
Never one to be overshadowed—even by a century-spanning fashion show—Bad Bunny modeled some spectacular suiting for his performance. He wore a gray pinstripe, double-breasted suit with statement padded shoulders from Pressiat. He accessorized with cherry red cowboy boots, yellow-lens sunglasses with thick black frames, and three diamond-encrusted chains from Messika layered on his neck.
There was jaw-dropping fashion throughout Vogue World 2024—but Bad Bunny still managed to command the Place Vendôme.
