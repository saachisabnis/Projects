Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for April 23rd, 2024. I sure hope you like reviews, because I have five of them for you today. Grounded, Ikki Unite, Hydlide II, Picross LogiartGrimoire, and Sokobond Express all get evaluated by yours truly. Then, it’s time for new releases! Some good ones today, actually. A solid Tuesday. We finish things up as we always do with the lists of new sales and expiring discounts. You know, in case you need to spend more money. Spoiler: lots of expiring ones today. Let’s get to it!
This is a really interesting spin on the usual survival game experience. Taking obvious cues from the classic Rick Moranis vehicle Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Grounded sees you playing as a kid who has been shrunken down and now has to survive in just about the most mundane but surprisingly hostile environment you could imagine: a backyard. It’s clever because every aspect of it is immediately recognizable, and yet the perspective makes things feel just fantastical and deadly enough to put some teeth on the experience. If you don’t like bugs, you might want to avoid this one. Yes, even with all the handy options that let you tone down some of that.
You can play this game cooperatively online with others, or so I’m told. I imagine that would be pretty fun, but I couldn’t get the online mode to work at all. Apparently an update has fixed this, but because I still haven’t been able to get it working as I write this, I can’t consider it in my evaluation. The big problem is an expected one, given this game’s origins. While at first it seems like another one of those miracle ports, the deeper you play into it the more the performance suffers. If you build any particularly complicated bases, the framerate will absolutely dive. Like, sometimes into the single digits. I’m sure whoever handled the port did their best with this aged hardware, but the compromises greatly impact its playability.
And that’s where we’re left with Grounded on Switch. It’s a cool twist on the usual survival game idea that I think is worth a go for fans of the genre, but this particular version of it quickly falls apart after a decent first impression. The framerate gets frankly horrendous during some sections of the game, and the online co-op feature is hit or miss. You’re better off playing this game anywhere else if you have the option to do so. If all you have is a Switch, you’re going to have to be even more tolerant of rough edges than usual to fully enjoy it. In a bit of an unusual case for one of our reviews, our pal Mikhail has requested a little space for his thoughts. Take it away, Mikhail!
I had access to Grounded on both Switch and PS5. Having only played it a bit on Xbox long ago, I was curious to see how it had improved over time. Right now, Grounded is a good concept that is fun in co-op with friends (even on other platforms), as long as it works. I ran into a few issues with playing thanks to the game not letting me swap between platforms seamlessly. There seems to be some sort of cooldown period because after quitting Grounded on Switch and booting it up on PS5, I got an error saying I can’t play because I’m already logged in elsewhere.
Being able to access your shared worlds across platforms is nice, but for a game that offers cross play and has Microsoft account linking, I really wish it was full cross progression and cross play like you’d expect from a modern game with online components. I can see myself coming back to Grounded to play with friends online, but I’m leaning towards playing it more on PS5 with the faster load times, better performance, and more. – Mikhail Madnani
SwitchArcade Score: 3/5
You know, as attempts to shoehorn a classic IP into a popular modern genre go, turning Ikki into a Vampire Survivors-style game is a good fit. While not well-known in the West, Ikki is one of Sunsoft’s more recognizable titles in the Japanese market. Not in a good way, I suppose, but certainly in an affectionate way. It was a clumsy top-down shooter of sorts, so this Survivors take on the concept works just fine. You wander around, battle enemies, level up, recruit followers, and take down nasty bosses.
Beyond the Ikki theme, the main thing that makes this one a little different from the norm is the online multiplayer support for up to sixteen players at once. It can be a bit of a wait to find people online to play with, so you’ll probably have to be patient depending on the time of day you’re online. It’s worth the wait, though. The sixteen players will be scattered across the map in groups of four, and part of the strategy is in trying to get as many people together as you can. Not just because it concentrates your attacks and abilities, but also because it’s easier to revive fallen members when you’re grouped up. One is weak, but sixteen are strong. Finally, the peasant rebellion that sits at the heart of Ikki feels like it’s being expressed properly.
There are a bunch of different characters to use, and they all have their own stats, weapons, and so on. You’ll be assigned a character randomly when you play online, and learning how to make the best use of each keeps things fresh. The online multiplayer is really the way to enjoy the game, as while you can play solo it just isn’t as fun. Still, the broad goal is the same. You’re starting a rebellion, and you need to overthrow the wicked ruler sitting at the center of the map. But to do that, you’ll need to defeat a variety of other bosses first. To be powerful enough to beat those bosses, you’ll need to power up by collecting chests and leveling up. And you can’t just grind in this game, either.
You have a timer counting down, and if it reaches zero you’ll hit an immediate game over. Defeating bosses add minutes to the timer, so you need to balance between seeking out chests to power up and beating bosses to keep the timer fed. This aspect is another way that Ikki Unite differentiates itself from its source of inspiration. Also, despite a steady stream of upgrades and power-up, you’ll never really reach that god-like level of power that you will in most games of this sort. The game is very clear in its design intent: one person is not powerful enough to overthrow a government. You can get strong, but the only way you’ll really overpower the flows of foes is by working with others.
Ikki Unite is a game with two faces. If you play it in the form I assume it was intended by heading online, it has a powerful identity of its own despite being clearly inspired by Vampire Survivors. If you play alone, you’ll find a very challenging game that isn’t quite as fun as the game it draws inspiration from. You can tell the developers really considered how to make this game feel like Ikki despite hopping on to a popular genre-of-the-moment. I’d recommend this to fans of this kind of game, provided they’re okay with playing online. After all, the rebellion that slays together, stays together.

Another Picross game? Yes, another Picross game. Even just sticking to games that have the Picross brand name attached, the Switch has over a dozen of these things. Each one offers over ten hours’ worth of puzzling fun, and those who like them tend to have at least a few stacked up in their backlogs. So why would you need this one? Okay, that’s a question that doesn’t need answering for the Picross die-hards. They already bought this. For the rest of you, why would you buy this one over the others?
The main thing that makes this different from the Picross S line of titles is that you get a bit of a story and some things outside of the puzzles to deal with. Not much of a story, mind you. But you’re trying to help some little wizard fix its grimoire, or something like that. You solve Picross puzzles like usual, and that’s no different from the other games. But in this game, you take the completed puzzles and merge them with each other to unlock more puzzles. You’ll also level the wizard’s magic up by solving puzzles, which opens even more puzzles. Puzzles into puzzles. You also get some additional puzzles to solve that were provided by backers of the game’s crowdfunding campaign. Sure, it’s just a fancy way of dressing up the same old business, but the effort is appreciated.
While Picross -LogiartGrimoire- doesn’t do anything revolutionary from a mechanical standpoint, its new framing for the puzzles makes this the best entry point for the series in quite a long while. If you’ve never played a Picross game before, I think this is the one to start with as far as the Switch releases go. If you have played a Picross game before, you probably picked this up the minute it released anyway.
SwitchArcade Score: 4/5
Mikhail was quite insistent that I try this game out when it released on Switch, and having played through it I can see why. This is a very cool puzzle game that also teaches you a thing or two as you go. At a basic level, it feels a bit like a PathPix-style puzzle where you need to draw a line from a starting point to an ending point, following certain rules along the way. The rules in this game’s case involves picking up all of the atoms on the board to create a certain kind of molecule by the time you hit the end of the line.
It’s trickier than it might initially seem, since you can have atoms bumping into each other. You need to consider your path so that you’ll brush up against the atoms with the part of your molecule you want the atom to attach to, and there are plenty of monkey wrenches thrown in as you make your way through the game’s stages. It all has a proper basis in chemistry, and so do all of the gimmicks. Each puzzle concludes with a little science fact, and that’s lovely. Even if you’re not interested in all that, the game part of things works just fine on its own. It starts off nice and simple, but by the end of its puzzles it’s wildly complex and devilish.
If you enjoy logic puzzles, you’ll likely find Sokobond Express to be a treat. It has a nice, simple presentation that makes all of its elements clear at a glance, chill music to listen to as you mull things over, a solid difficulty curve that eases you into the boiling pot, and has some educational value to boot. As path-finding puzzlers go, Sokobond Express is a superb example.
SwitchArcade Score: 4.5/5
I was going to lead with saying how this is probably the least-appealing Hydlide game and what a statement that was, but then I remembered Virtual Hydlide. The statement lacks punch if I switch it to say “second least-appealing Hydlide game", so let’s try another approach. The first Hydlide was a trailblazer whose influence on its genre goes largely ignored in the West. The third game face-planted hard but did so in large part because of its ambition. A commendable failure, in other words. Heck, even Virtual Hydlide has some comedic value to it. Who uses a golf game engine to make an action-RPG? T&E Soft, I suppose.
Hydlide II, though. Hydlide II is a very safe sequel, or at least it would seem to be in concept. There are a few new bits in here, like a basic morality system and a magic system, but by and large it plays out like the first game. There’s just a lot more of it here, and it’s there that it stumbles. Because more Hydlide largely amounts to more grinding, and my goodness is there a lot of grinding in this game. Indeed, the provided instructions in this EGGCONSOLE release advise you to use the nearby ghouls to grind up to level 5 before doing anything else, noting that you can use the fast-forward feature to speed up the process. This took me almost an hour. Again, it is the first thing you should do.
Aside from the grind, you also get some “puzzles" that are virtually impossible to solve without stepping on every square of the map or being told by someone else what to do, and this is the one Hydlide that never had a Western release in any guise up until now so English walkthroughs aren’t exactly plentiful. There are some hints in the game itself, but they’re very vague at best and of course are only in Japanese. This is, after all, the Japanese PC-8801 release of the game. Like some other EGGCONSOLE releases, you can skip around to various highlight moments in the game if you just want to do a little tourism.
Hydlide II isn’t the greatest of games even by the standards of its own series, and those coming to it with no nostalgia, nearly four decades later, are probably not going to have a very good time with it. The relatively low amount of text means the language barrier isn’t as big of an issue here as it is in some other EGGCONSOLE releases, so you probably could play through it if you have a mind to. But I doubt many but the most stubborn and dogged of gaming historians are going to try to do that.

Between the Cowabunga Collection and Shredder’s Revenge, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans definitely have their beat-em-up bases covered on modern consoles. I hope you have room for one more in your heart, as Raw Thrills’ 2017 arcade TMNT title makes its way home. You get three extra stages and six new boss fights in this version, and you can play it all with your buddies via four-player local multiplayer. Where will this fall in the Switch TMNT rankings? Find out when I review this one very soon!
Atari’s latest revival of one of its classic IPs goes a little bit beyond a recharge. Lunar Lander Beyond is a full-on follow-up to the original, though it incorporates a lot of elements from the likes of Gravitar along with some fresh mechanics of its own. Control a group of pilots and embark on a variety of missions that will test your navigation skills and your nerves. Does it do its legacy justice? Does it have what it takes to survive in the current year? I’ll be reviewing this one fairly soon as well, so keep your eyes open for that.
Dadish makes the leap from 2D platforming to the mysterious and dangerous world of the third dimension in this latest chapter of the Dadish Saga. The kids are missing again, led astray by pop-up ads, and Dadish has to round them all up by hopping and battling his way through deadly traps and hostile fast-food. There are fifty levels to play, a hamburger that does crimes, hidden collectible stars, and lots of dad jokes. Wouldn’t you know it? I’ll be reviewing this game, too. What a nice day for Shaun.
Here’s another Metroidvania-style exploratory platformer for you, and it’s a real mix of remarkable and plain elements. The presentation is really strong here all-around, and the story is well-told and poignant. At the same time, the gameplay mechanics and overall design are both surprisingly bland. Not bad, mind you. Just a bit middle-of-the-road in a very competitive genre. If you’re going into it for its distinct theme and highly personal story, I think you’ll be fine. There’s definitely something here, so it all comes down to what you’re looking for in this kind of game.
The only reason this isn’t in the Bin Bunch is that I feel it’s really important to warn people. Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is a solid, albeit flawed, spiritual successor to Konami’s Suikoden series of RPGs. Or at least it is on other platforms. On Switch, it’s an absolute mess. There is no excuse for a game that looks like this to run as badly as it does on the Switch. It’s also extremely buggy, in some very bizarre ways. Maybe this can get patched into something passable, but here and now I absolute cannot recommend this version of the game.

There are a couple of interesting things in the inbox, such as LEGO Star Wars hitting a new low price. But that’s not really the main point today, is it? No, it’s the end of the big Indie Partner sale that kicked off last week that is the chief concern. It’s time to check your wishlists and that list down below and make some final purchasing decisions while you can. I have faith in you.
