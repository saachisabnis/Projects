Tonight, luminaries from the worlds of fashion, sport, and the arts descended on Paris’s Place Vendôme to celebrate Vogue World: Paris—a dazzling showcase of the past, present, and future of French fashion, with performances by the likes of Aya Nakamura and Bad Bunny. Just as thrilling as those runway appearances—Gigi! Kendall! Paloma! Anok!—was all the behind-the-scenes commotion to bring the spectacle to life. And luckily, Vogue had a team of photographers—including German Larkin, Morgan O’Donovan, Corey Tenold, and Acielle—on the ground to capture all of the action. Take an exclusive look inside the Vogue World 2024 event in Paris here.
