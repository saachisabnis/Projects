Eladio Carrión shines bright with the highest debut of the week on Billboard’s Top Latin Albums and Latin Rhythm Albums charts, as Sol María, his sixth studio set, launches at No. 6 and No. 3, respectively, on the Feb. 3-dated rankings.

Sol María, a tribute to his mother, starts with 18,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 25, according to Luminate. The 17-track set blends trap, Afrobeats, reggae and ’90s pop, all genres that resonate with his mother. The set was originally set for a Dec. 23 release, but finally dropped Jan. 19, the first day of the chart’s tracking week.

Three other sets have peaked in the list’s upper region: Sauce Boyz 2 at No. 2 (2021), SEN2 KBRN, Vol. 2 at No. 4 (2022), and 3MEN2 KBRN at No. 3 (2023).
