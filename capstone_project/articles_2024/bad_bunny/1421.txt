Kid Cudi has been tapped to star alongside Adam Sandler in a sequel to the 1996 hit film, Happy Gilmore.
Deadline announced Cudi’s inclusion in the Netflix film on Friday (October 25), though they noted that his role – as well as the film’s plot – is still under wraps.  Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald will be reprising their roles of Virginia Venit and Shooter McGavin, respectively, and Sandler previously teased that both Travis Kelce and Bad Bunny will be making appearances as well.
