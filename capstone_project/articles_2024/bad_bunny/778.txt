LUMA Energy, responsible for Puerto Rico's electric transmission and distribution, reported progress in restoring power after a widespread outage affected the island. By Wednesday morning, 96.1 percent of customers had regained electricity.
However, the company warned that load shedding may occur in the coming days due to power plants still ramping up to full capacity following the disruption.
The extensive blackout that began on Tuesday has caused significant inconvenience across Puerto Rico, particularly as residents were preparing for the New Year. LUMA Energy has focused on restoring service but noted that full recovery could take time as power plants gradually return to operational levels. With load shedding expected to continue, managing the electricity demand will be crucial for avoiding further disruptions, per local outlets.
By Wednesday at 10:50 a.m., LUMA Energy reported that 96.1 percent of customers, or 1,410,643 people, had power restored. Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz√°lez Col√≥n indicated that as the power plants start generating from scratch, the grid may face load shedding, which would temporarily affect some customers in the upcoming days. She encouraged citizens to use energy more conservatively to help reduce strain on the system.
The blackout, which began early Tuesday morning, was caused by a malfunction in a 230,000-volt underground line, which carries electricity from the Costa Sur plant and the EcoEl√©ctrica cogeneration facility. The problem triggered a chain reaction that impacted the island's entire electricity grid. While the incident is under investigation, LUMA Energy has apologized for the disruption, which came at a particularly inconvenient time for Puerto Rican families.
LUMA Energy has been working to bring the grid back online. As of 5:00 a.m. Wednesday, 76.9 percent of subscribers had power restored. However, as of 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Costa Sur and EcoEl√©ctrica were still offline, and the total generation capacity was well below the usual levels, at around 1,000 MW instead of the typical 2,500 MW. The company relied on backup generators to help stabilize the situation, but it's clear that full recovery will take time.
LUMA Energy said that the entire restoration process could take 24 to 48 hours, depending on the situation. As of 1:00 p.m. Wednesday, 44,700 customers in the metro area and Culebra had their power restored, which is about 3 percent of the affected customers. Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi has urged LUMA and Genera PR to accelerate efforts to bring additional generating units back online and keep the public informed throughout the recovery process.
Puerto Rico's aging power grid, which has long been plagued by frequent blackouts, speaks to the vulnerability of its infrastructure. This ongoing energy crisis has even found its way into pop culture, with Puerto Rican icon Bad Bunny addressing the issue in his popular track "El Apag√≥n," which references the persistent power outages.
The island's electrical grid, already in poor condition before Hurricane Mar√≠a, has suffered from years of underfunding and inadequate maintenance. The hurricane worsened these existing problems, leading to a cycle of chronic blackouts and escalating electricity costs.
A major outage in June 2024, which impacted more than 340,000 residents, emphasized the system's fragility. Experts and critics, including community organizations, are calling for urgent reforms to prevent further disruptions and demanding accountability from companies like LUMA Energy for their role in the ongoing power struggles.
Jenniffer Gonz√°lez Col√≥n, governor-elect: "We remain in communication with the energy and security component so that the energization work throughout Puerto Rico is carried out in a coordinated, safe manner and with a sense of urgency."
LUMA Energy: "We continue to be in close communication and collaboration with island officials, the Governor, the Governor-elect, and our Mayors to keep them updated."
Seguimos en comunicaci√≥n con el componente de energ√≠a y seguridad para que los trabajos de energizaci√≥n de todo Puerto Rico se lleven de manera coordinada, segura y con sentido de urgencia. En la reuni√≥n de esta ma√±ana, nos aseguraron que cerca del 90% de los consumidores ya‚Ä¶
The power restoration process will continue over the next few days, with LUMA Energy focusing on increasing generation capacity and ensuring stability across the grid. The company will provide regular updates and is working closely with local officials to manage the situation.
