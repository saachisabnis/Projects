One of the creepiest animals in existence was just spotted in the Hudson Valley. The good news it that they don't have opposable thumbs so they can't sneak into your bedroom at night... the bad news is everything else.
Our corner of New York is full of beautiful natural wonders, but for every fluffy bunny or baby bird, there are some not-so-savory creatures. From the multiple carnivorous plants that live in New York's wetlands to the myriad predators stalking in our backyards, there's two sides of every coin. Few can compare, however, to the horsehair worm.
"What is this wild nope I saw in my driveway?!", came the question in a local Hudson Valley Facebook group. The accompanying photos and videos showed what looked like a wriggling piece of spaghetti on the blacktop. The answer was much more sinister.
The animal in question was the horsehair worm. Found in bodies of water ranging from ponds and puddles to residential pools and animal drinking troughs, certain insects like crickets and the praying mantis are at risk from a parasitic takeover from the worm's larvae. From the Wildlife Trusts:
Some species of horsehair worms [have] the ability to highjack the host’s nervous system, altering their behavior to make them actively seek out water... [hosts] jump into waterbodies, drowning themselves when the horsehair worm reaches its adult stage.
Thankfully, horsehair worms can only parasitize invertebrates, meaning that creatures ranging from humans to birds (and everyone else with a spine) are safe from the water-loving animals. That might not stop this video (below) from giving you nightmares, however.
While horsehair worms are thankfully non-invasive and non-human hunting, there are still plenty of plants and animals in New York state to give us a headache. Check out the worst offenders below.
