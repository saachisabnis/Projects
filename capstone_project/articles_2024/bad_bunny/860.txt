George and Amal Clooney's snub on the Met Gala red carpet left Vogue editor Andre Leon Talley absolutely livid.
The star-studded Met Gala is where A-listers dazzle with their most extravagant ensembles, yet sometimes things don't quite go as expected.
Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber have historically graced the event in outfits that leave the public speechless.
George and Amal are no strangers to the Met Gala either, having attended multiple times, but their behaviour during the China: Through the Looking Glass exhibition caused quite a stir.
At the 2015 gala, Amal turned heads in a striking red ruffled gown that accentuated her figure, while George looked dapper in his classic black tuxedo.

However, their sartorial elegance didn't win over Andre, who was visibly upset when they ignored him on the red carpet.
The incident was captured on film for the documentary "The First Monday in May."
Andre can be seen gesturing and speaking to a staff member at the event. 
"Can somebody go and tell Sally that the Clooneys did not stop? Go tell her now," he demanded.

When another staff member approached, Andre reported: "You know the Clooneys didn't stop so let Anna know that.
"George said hello but Mrs Clooney did not stop in her Galliano dress, I told Sally."
Whether George and Amal will grace this year's Met Gala remains to be seen.
The 2024 Met Gala, curated by Anna Wintour, is set to be a star-studded affair with Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, and Jennifer Lopez all confirmed as hosts.
The event will pay homage to the historical influence and artistic imagery in fashion.

The theme for the evening is 'Garden of Time', which will also be reflected in the post-Gala fashion exhibition titled 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'.
This exhibition promises to revolutionise the way we appreciate fashion, featuring 250 pieces and incorporating AI and CGI to enhance the experience.
While the guest list remains largely confidential, a few attendees have been disclosed. Lily Gladstone, Ayo Edebiri, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, Rihanna, and Kendall Jenner are among those invited to the prestigious event.
