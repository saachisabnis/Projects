As we approach the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards, the excitement and anticipation surrounding potential nominees have reached a fever pitch. This year, a notable highlight is the remarkable number of Latino actors vying for consideration. 
As informed by Variety, out of 1,957 actors submitted across all Emmy performer categories, at least 110 Latino actors are in contention, showcasing a significant step forward in representation. Despite a historical underrepresentation in major acting awards, this year's Latino nominees span various genres and platforms, highlighting the diversity and talent within the community.
Latinos have been historically underrepresented in the entertainment industry in front of and behind the camera. In the combined 249 years of the Oscars, Emmys, and Tonys, Latino actors have only won 25 awards (five Oscars, ten Emmys, and ten Tonys). This disparity is stark, especially considering the significant and growing Latino population in the United States. The underrepresentation has spurred calls for change and greater inclusivity within the industry
This year's Emmy acting ballots feature Latino actors across various genres, including comedy, drama, and guest roles. Some standout candidates include:
The global music sensation made a memorable guest appearance on "Saturday Night Live," showcasing his comedic talents and wide-ranging appeal. 
Known for his role in Apple TV+'s "Acapulco," Derbez continues to charm audiences with his portrayal, earning him a spot among the top candidates. 
A legendary figure in comedy, Lopez's performance in NBC's "Lopez vs. Lopez" has garnered attention, cementing his place as a contender in the comedy categories.
Already an Emmy winner, Leguizamo's role in "The Green Veil" has made him a hopeful for the Lead Drama Actor category. His passionate plea for greater diversity, highlighted by his full-page advertisement in the New York Times, underscores the ongoing need for change in the industry.
Her performance in Netflix's "3 Body Problem" has captivated audiences, positioning her as a strong candidate in the drama categories.
Ortega's role in Paramount+'s "Finestkind" has showcased her versatility, placing her among the top contenders in the drama categories.

This year promises to be a landmark moment for Latino representation in television, celebrating Latino actors' rich and diverse contributions to the industry.
