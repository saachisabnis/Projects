Drake has been immortalized in wax in Times Square as he becomes the latest celebrity added to the display at Madame Tussauds New York.
Drizzy’s wax figure was unveiled on Monday (July 1), as part of what Billboard reports is a multimillion-dollar investment into the NYC location. The OVO rapper was added to the ‘concert floor’ alongside fellow superstars Beyoncé, Bad Bunny, J. Balvin and more in a New Year’s Eve-type celebration.

Drake’s wax figure is pretty spot on, though Madame Tussauds can be hit or miss with their creations. Fans were less than impressed with the Beyoncé the museum debuted at the their Blackpool, England location earlier this year – but Jack Harlow was taken aback by the resemblance of his figure in Las Vegas in 2023.
Last July, Madame Tussauds USA shared footage of the moment Harlow came face to face with a spitting image of himself. The Kentucky rapper was highly impressed by the attention to detail, even saying that it exceeded his expectations.

“That is crazy,” he said as he stood beside the sculpture. “Is this mine? Everything just looks like he’s about to come to life. It’s good. He’s cut. I just wanna knock his ass over, you know?”
A little later, he added: “I was worried I was gonna sit here and be like, ‘Okay, this is funny cause it’s like an attempt,’ but it looks just like me.’”
