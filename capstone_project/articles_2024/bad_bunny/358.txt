Puerto Rico faces the prospect of ringing in New Year's Eve in darkness following a widespread power outage that has impacted 80 percent of the population and may see flights delayed or canceled.
Newsweek reached out to LUMA Energy, the company overseeing Puerto Rico's electricity transmission and distribution system, for comment via email.
Puerto Rico's aging power grid, long plagued by recurring blackouts, continues to highlight the fragility of its infrastructure. The energy crisis has even permeated pop culture, with Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny addressing the issue in his hit song "El Apag√≥n," which references the recurrent blackouts.
The latest outage, striking during New Year's Eve celebrations, has disrupted travel plans and daily life. For travelers, it has sparked concerns over flight delays and cancellations, while for residents, it serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for significant upgrades to the island's power system.
This incident follows a series of blackouts earlier in the year, including a storm-related outage in August that left 700,000 without power. Despite a recent transition to private grid management, progress in improving reliability has been slow.
The power outage began at approximately 5:30 a.m. Tuesday when a fault in an underground cable led to cascading failures across multiple power plants. Josu√© Col√≥n, director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said the repairs would require most of the day to stabilize the grid.
Governor Pedro Pierluisi called for urgent solutions from LUMA Energy and Genera PR, a private company that manages the grid. "We are demanding answers and solutions...and urging measures to restore service throughout the island," Pierluisi said on X (formerly Twitter).
LUMA Energy attributed the outage to a fault in an underground cable at a power plant on the island's southern coast. The failure triggered a "cascade effect," causing widespread failures across multiple power plants. The aging infrastructure, much of it reliant on fossil fuels, remains a critical weakness in Puerto Rico's energy system.
Restoration efforts have begun in phases, with LUMA Energy estimating that full service could return within 24 to 48 hours. Josu√© Col√≥n noted that while some areas were already seeing progress, stabilizing the grid would be a time-intensive process.
By 11 a.m., LUMA reported that power had been restored in some areas. The Medical Center and the San Juan Municipal Hospital were back online, and Culebra was receiving electricity through generators provided by Genera.
The Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in San Juan has managed to maintain operations using generators, allowing flights to continue. However, airlines advised travelers to monitor their flight statuses, warning of potential delays or cancellations if the situation worsens.
Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi, on X: "We are in communication with LUMA, Genera, and the PREPA team regarding the massive blackout affecting a large portion of the island due to a critical failure. Efforts are already underway to restore service using the San Juan and Palo Seco power plants. We are demanding answers and solutions."
Josu√© Col√≥n, director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, in a radio interview: "The fault triggered a cascade effect, resulting in widespread outages. Repairs are in progress, but complete restoration will take time."
Enid N√∫√±ez, a Puerto Rican resident, to the Associated Press: "The blackouts are just part of my everyday life."
Luma Energy, in a statement on X: "LUMA will restore power to customers in phases. We have already begun the restoration process for some customers, and the full process will take between 24 and 48 hours, provided conditions allow."
Power restoration is expected to continue into New Year's Day, with full service potentially returning within 48 hours. However, the recurring blackouts have intensified pressure on local and federal authorities to accelerate grid modernization efforts.
The blackout has intensified frustration with LUMA and Genera PR, the entities responsible for Puerto Rico's power distribution and generation, fueling growing calls for their removal.
Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz√°lez Col√≥n, who will assume office on January 2, has proposed the establishment of an "energy czar" to investigate potential contractual breaches by LUMA while exploring alternatives for a new operator.
