Spanish company DQuality Group and Puerto Rico-based Grupo VRDG announce a $90 million investment in Latin urban music festivals across Europe, aiming to enhance transparency, professionalism, and opportunities for artists in the burgeoning music scene.
In a groundbreaking move, the Spanish company DQuality Group and Puerto Rican Grupo VRDG have announced a strategic partnership to revolutionize Europe’s Latin urban music festival scene. Over the next three years, the alliance plans to invest over $90 million to boost the industry’s growth and bring top-tier festivals to new heights.
The partnership’s first major initiative will be felt in the summer of 2024 with the Reggaeton Beach Festival, a prominent series of Latin urban music festivals. This festival circuit includes 12 events and attracts approximately 450,000 attendees annually. “This alliance seeks to export that talent with a formal corporate structure,” explained Julio Cabral, CEO of Grupo VRDG, at a press conference held at the Spanish consular residence in Puerto Rico.
Cabral emphasized the goal of ensuring transparent pricing, direct and transparent artist bookings, and unprecedented technical production. “We aim to create more synergy and transparency, professionalize the market, offer better conditions to artists, and implement new performances in Europe,” added Raúl Rojas, director general and founder of DQuality Group.
This summer, the partnership secured top Latin urban artists for European performances. The lineup includes big names like Anuel AA, El Alfa, Tainy, Manuel Turizo, Jhay Cortez, Farruko, Saiko, María Becerra, De La Ghetto, Nio García, Bryant Myers, Lenny Tavarez, and Noriel, among others.
These festivals will be held from June 29 to August 4 in various Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, Tenerife, Mallorca, Santander, Torrevieja, Galicia, Gran Canaria, Asturias, Benidorm, and Oropesa del Mar. The Reggaeton Beach Festival, established by DQuality Group over a decade ago in 2017, has grown into a significant cultural event attracting massive crowds.
Rojas highlighted the importance of partnering with a Puerto Rican company, noting that it provides a direct pathway to booking artists, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries. “Puerto Rico has become the most important exporter of urban music to our country (Spain), and this alliance aims to stabilize, bring more transparency, and increase efficiency in these bookings, helping the entire market flourish,” Rojas stated.
Beyond enhancing the European festival circuit, the alliance aims to bring this successful festival model to Puerto Rico. Leaders from both companies see potential in exporting the Reggaeton Beach Festival format to Puerto Rico, further solidifying cultural and economic ties between the two regions.
Josep María Bosch, the Spanish Consul in Puerto Rico, emphasized the broader economic impact of these festivals. “There is an economic impact that goes beyond the money moved by the festivals, as there is a massive movement of people behind this,” Bosch pointed out. He stressed that Spain is “the natural gateway” for Puerto Rico to enter Europe, and this alliance will help increase the island’s visibility through music and attract potential tourists.
To integrate best market practices, the alliance will establish an advisory council comprising music industry professionals. This council will guide the partnership’s strategic decisions and ensure the festivals meet high standards of quality and professionalism.
This significant investment in Latin urban music festivals is not just about the business; it reflects a more profound cultural exchange between Latin America and Europe. Latin urban music, particularly reggaeton, has seen meteoric popularity worldwide. Artists from Puerto Rico, Colombia, and other Latin American countries have played a crucial role in this cultural phenomenon, breaking language barriers and bringing Latin rhythms to global audiences.
The urban music scene in Colombia has been thriving, with artists like J Balvin and Maluma leading the charge. These artists have dominated the Latin music charts and collaborated with international stars, bringing Colombian sounds to a broader audience. The Colombian government and private sectors have supported this industry, recognizing its potential to boost the economy and promote cultural heritage.
Similarly, Mexico has seen a surge in the popularity of urban music, with artists like Bad Bunny and Ozuna frequently topping charts and selling out concerts. The country’s music festivals, such as Vive Latino and Corona Capital, have embraced urban music, reflecting its growing influence. These events attract thousands of attendees, contributing significantly to the local economy and tourism industry.
As the alliance between DQuality Group and Grupo VRDG progresses, it promises to bring more opportunities for Latin urban music artists to shine on the European stage. The focus on transparency, professionalism, and high-quality production will set new standards in the festival industry, benefiting artists, fans, and the broader cultural landscape.
This partnership also highlights the importance of strategic collaborations in the music industry. By combining resources and expertise, companies can create more impactful events, drive innovation, and reach new audiences. For Latin American artists, this means more exposure, better conditions, and the chance to be part of a global music movement.
