Jennifer Lopez was a sight for sore eyes at the 2024 Met Gala, taking on the role of co-chair. However, her husband, Ben Affleck, was noticeably absent from her side for the evening due to his commitment to filming a movie.
According to a representative for Affleck who spoke with Entertainment Tonight, his absence was due to his involvement in filming The Accountant 2 in Los Angeles.
JLo and Affleck's love story is nothing short of remarkable. After first dating in 2002 and parting ways in 2004, they found their way back to each other two decades later. During that time, they both formed families of their own. Lopez shares two children with her ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck has three children with his former wife, Jennifer Garner. The pair got married in July 2022 after rekindling in April 2021.
At the exclusive affair, the Marry Me actress captivated all in a custom Schiaparelli gown crafted by Daniel Roseberry. Resembling delicate butterfly wings, the gown perfectly encapsulated the theme of "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion," featuring 2.5 million beads meticulously hand-placed over 800 hours. She complemented the ensemble with an updo and ethereal makeup. Her choice of jewelry, courtesy of Tiffany & Co., included a Jean Schlumberger by Tiffany Bird on a Rock ring. Completing the ensemble was a metallic clutch and platform heels.
The "On The Floor" singer shared the prestigious role of co-chair with three other celebrities: Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny.
"I was really honored to be asked to host it alongside [them]," Lopez said on Good Morning America. "Anna was gracious enough to ask me. We're going to have a good time."
