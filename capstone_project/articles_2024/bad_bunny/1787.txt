STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Get ready, because “Saturday Night Live” returns with a new episode tonight.
English-Albanian singer-songwriter Dua Lipa will make her debut as host and perform as the musical guest for the third time. Adding to the excitement, her third studio album, “Radical Optimism,” was scheduled to be released May 3.
With seven Brit Awards and three Grammy Awards under her belt, Lipa has been on a role with recent hits, like the chart-topping collaboration with Elton John “Cold Heart (Pnau Remix),” and the catchy track ”Dance the Night,” which was featured on the soundtrack of the “Barbie” movie.
