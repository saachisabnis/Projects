	After releasing his critically acclaimed album, the 80-minute Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana, and pulling double duty as the host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live, Bad Bunny embarked on his 47-date tour across America in February. 

	Dubbed the Most Wanted Tour, Benito’s trek included 47 dates for the first half of the year, with stops including the opener in Salt Lake City, Utah, plus multiple dates at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and Barclays Center in Brooklyn, before wrapping up with a series of concerts in Miami. With tickets still on sale and some sold out, the tour will support the Rolling Stone cover star‘s new No. 1 full-length project.

	“Mega-artist restlessness is a common affliction among world-straddling musical titans,” Rolling Stone described in our Bad Bunny album review, “and Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana is the sound of an artist processing it — and fighting it, and transcending it, and blowing it off — in his own unique terms. As always, Benito goes his own way.”

	










	Though he’s in the final stretch of the Most Wanted Tour, here’s everywhere you can still buy Bad Bunny tickets right now (including the places to look for stubs that’ve sold out) to hear “Monaco,” “Un Preview,” and more in real life.
