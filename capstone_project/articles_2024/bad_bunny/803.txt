As bad as the Dallas Cowboys' season has gone, Monday's 27-20 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals was perhaps the most disheartening moment of the year.
With the game tied late in the fourth quarter, the Cowboys forced the Bengals to punt and had the chance to get the ball back and mount a game-winning drive. Dallas almost made things much easier by getting a hand in and blocking the punt, but a critical error on the recovery gave the ball back to the Bengals.
Just three plays alter, Cincinnati found the endzone to take a seven-point lead as Joe Burrow connected with Ja'Marr Chase on a 40-yard touchdown pass with just over a minute to go. The Cowboys got the ball back with a bit of time left, but turned it over on downs to seal to the loss.
After the punting miscue, fans trolled the Cowboys on social media.
In some ways, the ending of Monday's game encapsulates how the season has gone for the Cowboys. It's been nothing short of a disspointment.
The Bengals, who are in a similar boat as Dallas this year, found some good luck in the win, something that's been a rare sight for them in 2024.
Luck is part of it, but another outstanding performance from Burrow and Chase was what led to the win. Burrow had 369 passing yards and three touchdowns on 33-of-44 passing while Chase collected 177 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 14 receptions.
Those kinds of games from Burrow and Chase have been commonplace this year. Winning? Not so much. The Bengals improved to just 5-8 with Monday's victory, leaving them with lots of work to do to reach the playoffs.
