Crocs has teamed up with “Scooby-Doo!” to release a new clog collection featuring two new shoe styles, available now at Crocs.com.
The collection includes a Classic Clog resembling Scooby-Doo himself, the titular Great Dane that helps solve mysteries alongside teenagers Shaggy, Daphne, Fred and Velma.
Available in adult, kid and toddler sizes, the shoe is brown with splotches of black (just like the beloved cartoon dog) and a 3D embellishment on the upper resembling Scooby’s light blue collar. The left insole features Scooby’s face while the right has his catchphrase written on it: “Ruh Roh!” The shoe can be adorned with Jibbitz modeled after a paw print or Scooby snacks. The adult version of the clog retails for $69.99.

The collection also includes a $99.99 platform mule modeled after the Mystery Machine. Known as the Siren clog in a colorway called Lime Punch, the shoe features a 3.5 inch block heel with the van’s moniker on it. The upper is light blue while the sole is light green with blue and orange accents.
Staying true to the famous van’s design, the sole also includes orange flowers and the upper can be decorated with Jibbitz offering the same floral accent. Meanwhile, the green insole of each shoe features an image of the mystery-solving crew with the franchise’s name. An additional detail on the back heel is a license plate reading “Scby Snx Coolsville.”
Additional themed Jibbitz include the Mystery Machine van, likenesses of the four main human characters and Scooby, and one reading “Scooby Doo, where are you!”
This collection continues Crocs’ collaborative streak with a number of famous names and franchises, ranging from “SpongeBob SquarePants” to Bath & Body Works to Bad Bunny.
