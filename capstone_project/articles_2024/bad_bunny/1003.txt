Anything can happen in Idaho and if you've been here for some time, you've probably seen some interesting things. Now, we can add another unusual event to that list and it's all going down in the Boise Bench.
We recently noticed some complaints in the popular Facebook group "Boise Bench Dwellers" about bunnies overtaking the Bench.
"After talking to my neighbors and others along with my own experience something needs to be done," one group member wrote in a post.
"I would say to control them but after finding out they have 2 uterus I don’t think you can control them."
The post, which included a photo of a black rabbit in a yard, resulted in over a hundred comments with many divided on whether or not the rabbits are a threat.
"They are a problem! They have eaten my plants and dug up others," commented one person, "At a certain point it becomes a rodent problem just like rats or voles."
On the other hand, some people felt like the bunnies presented no issue whatsoever.
"You have a nitpicking problem if the rabbits bother you," another wrote.
"They chill in the yard and cause no problems whatsoever. It must be exhausting to live In a world where you dread the sight of a bunny. Invest in a scarecrow."
It's common knowledge that bunnies like to reproduce and do so at a very rapid pace. If pet owners are releasing their bunnies into the Boise Bench area, they could be linking up and reproducing at a high rate causing the bunny invasion.
