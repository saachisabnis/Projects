With Black Friday passed and the holiday shopping window fully open, the sneaker giants are duking it for your attention in a month packed with high-profile releases. 
Be they retro Air Jordans, flame-riddled Nike runners or a divisive sneaker-loafer hybrid from New Balance, December is shaping up to be a strong end of the year for kicks. Lil Yachty will get his first release through a special Air Force 1 Low, while a Kobe Bryant tribute will also decorate the same model. Fear of God is set to debut its second Basketball sneaker from Adidas, and the Brand With Three Stripes will also unveil the modernized Adizero SL72 through a collaboration with Bad Bunny. And of course, we can’t forget one last Travis Scott release to get the people going.
