To be fair, Taylor Swift has been booked and busy!
Jennifer Lopez dropped a documentary about her new visual film This Is Me Now: A Love Story, and it's an extremely candid look at the making of the projectâ€”including what it was like to book all those celebrity cameos. But while the movie has appearances from a lot of A-listers, apparently some major names passed.
In one scene, casting director Nancy Nayor tells J.Lo, "We sent out all the offers last night to everybody and we're waiting to hear back from a few people. Like Jane Fonda." A voice off-camera then adds, "Taylor Swift is a no" as a producer says, "Jason Momoa is not available, Jennifer Coolidge not available, Lizzo not available." 
Someone then asks J.Lo if she wants "Vanessa Hudgens, by the way," and she responds with "For what?" before another person notes, "She's not available." At another point, the celeb says, "It'd be good to get Bad Bunny to do a little cameo as the bad kid," and is then told that "Ariana Grande's unavailableâ€”she's in London until September."
J.Lo's reaction to her famous friends being busy, you ask? Keeping it chill and saying, "I don't wanna force anybody to do this who doesn't go 'This is going to be fun'...Nobody wants to say no to me, Benny, I get that. But when an actor doesn't like a script, or doesn't think it's good enough, or is worried about it, that's what they'll say. I know that. I've done it."
Oh, and in response to telling her choreographer Sienna Lallau that KhloÃ© Kardashian was supposed to make a cameo, which didn't happen, J.Lo says, "People scared, scared to put themselves out there. I get it. Took me a long time. I'm scared."
FWIW, This Is Me...Now: A Love Story ended up having a ton of cameos, including from the likes of Jane Fonda (she came through!), Derek Hough, Trevor Jackson, Fat Joe, Jennifer Lewis, Post Malone, Trevor Noah, Keke Palmer, Sofia Vergara, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Kim Petras, among many others!
