	In the 2023 calendar year, 765 songs appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, by a total of 385 different artists.

	Of those 385 acts, 99 achieved their first career entries on the chart in 2023. Billboard has been celebrating all these Hot 100 First-Timers throughout the year, highlighting their first appearances, explaining how they achieved their first entries, and sharing their reactions to the news.

	For many of 2023’s 99 Hot 100 first-timers, their first entries led to repeat visits. Peso Pluma, for instance, logged his first Hot 100 hit in February with “AMG,” with Gabito Ballesteros and Natanael Cano. He charted 22 additional songs during the year since then, including the No. 4-peaking “Ella Baila Sola” with Eslabon Armado – the first top 10 and highest-charting regional Mexican song in history. His 23 entries in 2023 mark the second-most among all core Latin-music artists this year, after Bad Bunny’s 28, and the eighth-most among all acts.

	Ice Spice also earned her first Hot 100-charting hit in 2023, when “Gangsta Boo” debuted at No. 82, also in February. She charted six additional songs in 2023, including four top 10s: her featured turn on Taylor Swift’s “Karma” (No. 2 peak); “Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2,” with fellow 2023 first-timer PinkPantheress (No. 3); “Princess Diana,” with Nicki Minaj (No. 4); and “Barbie World,” with Minaj and Aqua (No. 7).

	Two 2023 first-timers hold the distinction of attaining not just their first Hot 100 entries, but also their first No. 1s. BTS’ Jimin posted his first solo title on the chart in January, with his feature on TAEYANG’s “Vibe,” and three months later, he banked his first solo No. 1 with “Like Crazy.” Before those solo hits, though, he tallied six No. 1s as a member of BTS. Additionally, Oliver Anthony Music’s first appearance on the chart was at No. 1, when his surprise viral hit “Rich Men North of Richmond” bounded in on top, making him the first artist to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100 with no prior chart history.

	Other notable names who visited the Hot 100 for the first time in 2023 include: best new artist Grammy nominee Noah Kahan, rising K-pop groups NewJeans, FIFTY FIFTY and Stray Kids, and multi-talented actors Jack Black, Dave Chappelle, Lily-Rose Depp, and the Kenergetic Ryan Gosling.

	Kahan is one of five acts up for best new artist that made their first Hot 100 visits during the year, along with Ice Spice (“Gangsta Boo”), Gracie Abrams (“Everywhere, Everything” with Kahan), Coco Jones (“ICU”) and The War and Treaty (“Hey Driver” with Zach Bryan). As for the other three best new artist nominees: Victoria Monét earned her first entry in 2019 with her Ariana Grande collaboration, “Monopoly,” but she notched her second entry, and first solo unaccompanied hit, in September with “On My Mama”; Jelly Roll arrived on the chart for the first time in July 2022 with “Son of a Sinner,” but tallied three additional entries in 2023, including his highest-charting hit “Need A Favor” (No. 13); and Fred Again hasn’t yet reached the Hot 100, but has charted 18 tracks on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.
