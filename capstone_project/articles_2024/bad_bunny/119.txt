Kendall Jenner admitted she has faced mental health struggles and said her career took a serious toll on her well being.
She candidly expressed her feelings of isolation and loneliness on the Aug.1 episode of the “Anything Goes with Emma Chamberlain” podcast. The 28-year-old became emotional as she described her experience. Jenner explained her modeling job required long periods of time away from her loved ones and admitted she didn’t always handle that very well. “It is very lonely,” Jenner said. “I’ve had really dark nights where I’ve been in random cities and just hysterically crying myself to sleep because I haven’t been home in three months and I’ve been pretty much alone the entire time,” she said.
Jenner expressed gratitude for her blessings, but expressed that the challenges were very real for her.
“There’s been a lot of definite moments where I’m like ‘What is going on, is this all worth it?’” Jenner said on the  podcast
“I’m not gonna sit here and say that I’ve had the toughest journey. I think I’ve been extremely fortunate,” she said. “But I also have had my own set of challenges, whether it’s [being] overworked or not getting a job that I would’ve really loved to get.”

She spoke about the toll that constant travel had on her life.
Jenner said it was hard on her when “something really crazy happens at home that I would love to be there for and I’m being told I can’t be.”

The model and reality television star said she tries to ground herself by “cleansing” her body in a shower or “submerging” herself in any type of water, noting that her Scorpio sign makes her crave the comforts that water brings. Long walks and disconnecting from the digital world have also proven to be modes of stress relief for Jenner.
She put things in perspective and found the positive in her experience. (RELATED: Pete Davidson Cancels Appearances, Checks Into Mental Health Center: REPORT)

“It really is a beautiful thing to be able to travel the world the way I have. I probably would’ve never traveled the way I have or the amount that I have had I not had this job. I’ve met a lot of amazing people,” she said.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
