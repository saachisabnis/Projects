DETROIT LAKES
    
       — At the base of Detroit Mountain near the Z-lift, the nighttime wind bites with a bitter chill. Under the stadium lights, a glittering layer of ice gleams beneath the groomed snow on the “Bad Medicine” run. Bright blue and red ski racing gates dot the slope, and the mountain feels still.
The quiet is shattered as a racer in a bright red bib carves down the hill, a spray of snow trailing behind. The crackle of skis cutting through hard snow echoes over the frosted treetops. It’s one of many runs on Monday, Dec. 16, when 17 adult ski racers — including one snowboarder — took over the slopes near the main lodge for Detroit Mountain’s inaugural Adult Recreational Race League.

“The main reason that we’re doing this is because we want to grow the love of the sport, and we’re trying to give people one more thing to do outside,” said Jennifer Smith, Snow School coordinator and Alpine Race Team head coach.
The league is open to racers of all abilities, ages 18 and up, and is divided into five age categories, with the oldest being 55 and older. For the program’s first year, Smith said the goal is to host one race a month, with hopes of eventually expanding to weekly races.
Snowboarders are just as welcome as skiers, though Smith acknowledged the program has some growing to do before it can support an exclusive category for riders.
Jeff Stowman, a ski and snowboard instructor at Detroit Mountain, stood in the main lodge on Sunday, Dec. 15, in a royal blue ski coat. He said he has advocated for an adult race league for nearly a decade. With the reality setting in that he was about to compete the following evening, Stowman admitted he felt a mix of emotions.
“Excited and nervous,” he said with a laugh. “How can I be nervous for a fun race on a Monday night? But it’s going to be exciting.”
Racers pay a $5 entry fee to participate. Each race consists of two timed runs, with the times added together to determine results. Points are awarded based on placement, and final standings are posted near the bar in the main lodge. Racers can warm up with practice runs about half an hour before the timed runs begin.
Tom Thiel, now in his second season as Detroit Mountain’s general manager, said he hopes the new league encourages more people to take advantage of all the mountain has to offer.

“(Detroit Mountain) is just a fantastic place, especially in the winter, to get outside and not be cooped up indoors, staring at screens,” Thiel said.
Smith said she hopes a local group will take over the league to help it grow. For now, upcoming races are scheduled for Jan. 13 and Feb. 10, with bib pick-up starting at 6:30 p.m. More information is available on Detroit Mountain’s

Upon entering Detroit Mountain’s main lodge, visitors are greeted by a wall to their right displaying photos of youth ski teams. On one side are images of the high school team, starting with its inaugural 2021-2022 season. The other side showcases Detroit Mountain youth ski teams, with the earliest photo dating back to 2016.
“They’re not all up there, because we’ve been doing it forever,” Smith said.
According to Smith, the Detroit Mountain team averages about 110 participants ages 3 to 18 each season, overseen by 8 to 10 coaches. The program is divided into three categories: Rising Stars (ages 3 to 6 or beginner skiers), Super Stars (ages 4 to 7, serving as an entry-level racing program) and Big Blue (ages 6 and up, focusing on fundamental racing skills).
At the east end of the main lodge, a yurt serves as a clubhouse for the high school and youth teams. As the youth programs grow, Smith envisions an upgrade.
“My goal is, I’m about halfway there, I want a bigger (yurt),” she said. “When we have race day, we can’t all fit in there. I’m looking for a double-wide trailer, to make it more like a classroom, so we have space for lockers and all that.”

The yurt overlooks the “Potential Park,” where Rising Stars practice alongside the steady motion of the magic carpet. These young skiers participate in “bubble gum races,” competing for pieces of gum, and “lick-it-and-stick-it” practices, where they earn gummy bears for their engagement. After licking the gummy bear, they stick it to their helmet, where it freezes. At the end of practice, the kids eat their treats.
“So when they’re listening it’s just a positive reinforcement and it gets them excited about skiing,” Smith said.
The program continuously adjusts participants’ levels based on ability. Smith said it’s rewarding to watch the progress. At practice on Sunday, Dec. 14, Smith stood at the base of the bunny hill. Eva, a Rising Star, skied down before her mom caught her at the base.
“(Eva) was not independent last season, someone was with her 100% of the time,” Smith said. “I even said to the other coach, ‘You have got to go find her, wait until you see what she’s doing.’ It’s just really awesome to see these guys grow.”
Smith emphasized that her mission is to foster a lifelong love of skiing.
“We want kids to love skiing; that’s it. That’s my mission,” she said. “It has nothing to do with results, doesn’t matter how fast they are; I just want them to love skiing because they can do it forever.”
Registration for the youth teams is still open, and more information is available on the mountain’s
