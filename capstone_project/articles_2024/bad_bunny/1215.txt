While the details of Cudi’s character remain under wraps, the screenshot he shared of the Deadline exclusive announcing the news of his role provided some insight into the structure of the cast currently on board to appear in the film. Both Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald will reprise their roles as the characters Virginia Venit and Shooter McGavin for the sequel. Additionally, Latin music sensation Bad Bunny is also a part of the cast and Sandler also reportedly “teased” the likelihood of a cameo from NFL Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce in the film.
With his upcoming role in the Netflix production, Cudi adds to his impressive television and filmography résumé, which has exploded throughout the past few years. In addition to starring in the A24-produced horror-thriller X in 2022, Cudi also released his animated series Entergalactic via Netflix last year. He also appeared in the Disney+ sci-fi fil Crater, in addition to the series Knuckles, which is based on characters from the universe of Sonic The Hedgehog.
