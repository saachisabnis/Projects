The pressure to have a “perfect” smile is intensifying. In a recent survey by Censuswide and Colgate, nearly 65% of the Generation Z audience said pressure to have a perfect smile negatively affects their confidence, with over 85% expressing a desire to change their smile. 
Armed with these jarring stats, Colgate and agency partner VML sought to overcome a younger generation’s lack of self-acceptance. Its new campaign, “My Smile Is My Superpower,” aims to empower young adults to embrace their smiles in all of their “shapes, sizes and shades.” 
Colgate launched “The Beauty of Gaps,” a 90-second video with a diverse cast of young adults proudly displaying their gap-toothed smiles.
