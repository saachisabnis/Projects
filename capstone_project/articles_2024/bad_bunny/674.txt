Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company, recently announced that it would be pulling its music—including Taylor Swift, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo, Bad Bunny, and thousands of other artists—from TikTok because its license agreement was expiring and renewal talks had broken down. The license expired on Wednesday, and TikTok has initiated steps to remove UMG-published music from its platform.
Does this mean that no songs by UMG’s artists and songwriters can be heard on TikTok videos now? Well, not really.
If you post on TikTok, you can choose music for your video from TikTok’s catalog of songs, which includes millions of tracks from record labels and independent artists, which license their music to TikTok for use on the platform. UMG’s catalog is no longer part of that offering.
Yet you can also upload your own music or play music in the background while recording your video. When using your own music, TikTok requires you to agree that you have permission to use the music—that you created it yourself, you licensed it properly from the creators or the music is in the public domain. If you upload music to which you don’t have permission, then you’re violating TikTok’s terms of service.
But what happens if you do upload someone else’s copyrighted music? TikTok scans uploads and uses automated content recognition technology to check for matches against a database of copyrighted material, similarly to the way YouTube does it with its Content ID system.
The problem is that the ACR technology doesn’t find everything. This means that record labels and other copyright owners also run ACR on TikTok videos, and if they find their content in a video, they can issue a request to TikTok, known as a takedown notice; and then TikTok will remove the music from it. This is an ongoing task that many copyright owners liken to the game of Whac-a-Mole, and there are a number of copyright monitoring services that do this for copyright owners.
If you disagree with a takedown notice sent on your video, you can submit a counter-notification to have the video restored. This is all part of a process that Congress set up in 1998 with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
TikTok also offers a “video sound copyright check” setting in the mobile app. This feature helps users avoid copyright strikes that could result in TikTok terminating their accounts—a step that services like TikTok and YouTube take to lower their risk of copyright liability under the DMCA.
There’s a further complication to the copyright issues around UMG’s pullout from TikTok: the pullout includes UMG’s music publishing division, Universal Music Publishing Group, which manages its songwriters’ compositions, in addition to the record labels that manage recording artists’ tracks.
There are two copyrights for every piece of recorded music: one for the songwriter’s composition (the music and lyrics), the other for an artist’s recording of that composition. If you record a cover version or create a remix of a song, then you’re using the songwriter’s copyright on that composition.
The problem is that it’s considerably harder to detect remixes or covers of compositions automatically than it is to detect matches to sound recordings.
ACR techniques exist for musical compositions (melodies, lyrics, etc.); for example, YouTube uses them in its Content ID ACR system. But they are not as accurate as the ACR technology for sound recordings, which has been around for many more years and has become quite accurate. (No ACR system is perfect, but they do vary in accuracy.)
And there are various gray areas in which a sound recording may or may not embody a certain musical composition or may “transform” it in ways that might be considered fair use in law.
For example, Elton John is one of the large number of songwriters whose compositions are managed by UPMG. If I were to record an acoustic guitar bossa nova version of Elton’s “I’m Still Standing” sung in Portuguese, then an ACR system built to detect musical compositions may or may not identify it properly, and if UMPG were to sue me for copyright infringement, I might decide to attempt a fair use claim in court.
Furthermore, most pop songs nowadays have multiple songwriters; the average pop hit today has more than four. In many of those cases, the songwriters are represented by multiple publishers.
So there are likely many thousands of songs for which the songwriting credits are split among UPMG-affiliated songwriters and songwriters who have other music publishers. This further complicates the task of identifying which songs are no longer licensed to TikTok.
The final complication for TikTok is, of course, that most TikTok videos contain only short snippets of songs, which can also make it harder for ACR technology to identify them.
TikTok has eliminated recordings from UMG’s catalog as choices for music that TikTokers can use with their videos now. TikTok has also muted the audio on many, though not all, existing videos that used UMG-published music.
It’s likely that TikTokers will be more motivated to invent more hacks for putting up UMG music on TikTok because of its lack of official availability. For example, some ACR technologies have been known to fail to match a recording if the uploader shifts the pitch of the music a bit. TikTok is currently testing an enhanced version of its ACR that it expects to roll out in the coming months; it says that the new technology will be able to match compositions, remixes, and mashups as well as detect pitch- or speed-shifted sound recordings.
It will be interesting to see whether such additional steps will end up being required by UMG—and by other music companies—in the future, although such requirements are typically kept confidential.
Analogous situations have come up in the past. For example, Warner Music Group pulled out of its license agreement with YouTube in 2008 before renewing it nine months later. As one music executive who was involved in this deal put it, “Remember how well it went when WMG went dark on YouTube? We barely even went dim.”
Yet UMG’s pullout from TikTok is likely to have more of an impact than WMG’s pullout from YouTube: YouTube requires all users to upload their own copies of music and does not normally offer a library of ready-to-use, pre-cleared music. TikTokers are noticing the lack of material from UMG’s big stars, and that will continue until such time as the two companies come to agreement again.
