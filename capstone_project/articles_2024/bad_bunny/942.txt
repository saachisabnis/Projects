Update: One pair of adidas YEEZY history that has resurfaced several times to date is the adidas YEEZY 500 “Stone Taupe.” We took an in-hand look at the pair last year and it’s finally set to release next week. The off-white presentation of the silhouette combines with a white midsole and gum outsole to create a summer-friendly finish. Release is set for March 18 at 10am EDT via an adidas Confirmed drawing at a price of $210 USD.
Original Story: adidas has certainly been feeling the blow on the sales front without its partnership with Ye and has been leaning on the introductions of new silhouettes and collaborations with other music roster members like Bad Bunny and Pharrell to keep them afloat. There’s still no word on if and when the brand will continue to drop YEEZY-designed products in the foreseeable future, but in the meantime, samples like this adidas YEEZY 500 have been continuing to pop up on occasion.
This iteration is executed with a minimal presentation and leans on a neutral-heavy palette that Ye often favored for this particular model. Uppers are formed with their customary mesh and suede build, the former of which is outfitted in an off-white hue while the latter is dialed with buttery light gray suede. Down below the bottom piece is loaded up with adiPrene cushioning and surrounded by an all-white midsole while the outsoles contrast with a gum exterior.
