	“Soltera” scales the Latin Airplay summit as it concurrently runs up a 12-week domination on the Latin Pop Airplay chart. The song drew 11 million in all-format radio airplay audience in the U.S. during the Dec. 20-26 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	As “Soltera” becomes the week’s new leader, it eclipses Karol G’s “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido” after the latter’s 23 weeks in charge, the second-longest No. 1 run on Latin Airplay. Overall, Shakira’s own “La Tortura,” featuring Alejandro Sanz, retains the record with 25 weeks at No. 1 in 2005. The former experienced a record consecutive 23-week domination; the No. 1 stay of “La Tortura” was interrupted twice.

	Here’s the recap of the artists with the most Latin Airplay No. 1s:

	36, J Balvin34, Ozuna32, Enrique Iglesias28, Daddy Yankee25, Bad Bunny24, Maluma24, Shakira

	Further, as “Soltera” leads Latin Airplay, it becomes Shakira’s first No. 1 without a billed collaborator since “Loba,” her eighth No. 1, in 2009. Among her 24 career No. 1s, she has logged six solo, including her first four in 1998-2003, beginning with “Ciega, Sordomuda.”

	“Soltera” reached No. 9 in October on the streaming-, airplay- and sales-based Hot Latin Songs chart. It became her 37th top 10, the most among women since the survey started in 1986.
