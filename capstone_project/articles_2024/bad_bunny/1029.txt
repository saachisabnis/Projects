Margaret Qualley, star of The Substance, has shared an amusing anecdote about how her husband's fib helped her secure a role in the upcoming Netflix film Happy Gilmore 2, starring Adam Sandler.
Netflix stirred up excitement in early September when it announced the sequel to the beloved comedy, with Sandler reprising his role as Happy Gilmore. Margaret was quick to express her enthusiasm, telling her agents to get on it immediately after the news broke.
During her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Margaret confessed that Sandler was her "first crush" and that the original 1996 movie is her "favourite movie." She went on to explain how her husband, musician Jack Antonoff, had a hand in getting her cast in the film.
Jimmy Fallon showed the audience a screenshot of a text exchange between Sandler and Jack. Sandler asked: "Jacko. It's Sandler. Does your wife golf at all?", to which Jack responded: "Yeah, she's actually good!," reports the Daily Star.
Despite her lack of golfing skills, Margaret humorously admitted that Jack "lied for the sake of the family." She mentioned that she has since taken up golf lessons for the role but admits she's "still bad."
Margaret expressed sheer joy at having landed even a minor background role in Happy Gilmore 2, saying: "It's a tiny part. I'm essentially deep background, but I can die happy now."
Margaret and Jack tied the knot in August 2023, with a guest list that boasted names like Taylor Swift and Lana Del Rey. Their love story famously inspired Lana Del Rey's 2023 song 'Margaret', which features Jack's band, Bleachers.
The actress currently stars in The Substance, a body horror film directed by French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat. She stars as Sue, a younger version of Demi Moore's character Elisabeth Sparkle that emerges after the ageing star takes a black market drug to reclaim her youth.
The film has received an early positive reception, earning a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
As for Happy Gilmore 2, there is no official release date as of yet. The confirmed cast includes Julie Bowen (Modern Family) and Christopher McDonald (Thelma and Louise), both returning to their roles from the original film. Other notable names in the cast include musician Bad Bunny and NFL star Travis Kelce.
