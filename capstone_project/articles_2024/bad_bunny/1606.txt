Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Exeter earlier this week. Per the BBC, the university awarded Albarn “in recognition of his creativity, innovation, and commitment to environmental causes.”

	Albarn briefly addressed the Exeter graduates in a casual speech given on Wednesday. 

	“The last time I came to Exeter was to receive my driving theory certificates, this is somewhat of an elevation,” Albarn joked at the university’s commencement. “My daughter graduated last week, and it’s an amazing day when you see your child walk up there and receive their degree. Congratulations to all the students, may you forge wonderful careers.”

	Albarn also gave a brief bit of advice to the graduating class, encouraging them to think for themselves in an era of distortions and misinformation.

	“Don’t believe in anything until you really know in your heart that it’s worth your belief,” Albarn said. “These days there’s so many ways for a single fact to become so fragmented and distorted, it’s insane. Trust in your instincts, don’t take no for an answer, be open-minded, and go out there and do great things.”

	










	It’s unclear what Albarn’s next project will be. Blur briefly reunited last year with their first album in eight years, going on tour throughout Europe and South America. Albarn said at the end of 2023 that the band was going on hiatus again, though they’d go on to play two shows at Coachella in April. The Gorillaz, meanwhile, last released an album in 2023 with their star-studded Cracker Island, which featured Stevie Nicks, Bad Bunny, Beck, and Thundercat, among others.
