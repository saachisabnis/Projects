	Bob Weir is voting for Kamala Harris and her vice presidential pick, Tim Walz, in the upcoming election.

	The Grateful Dead rocker took to Instagram on Monday (Oct. 28) to share a photo of himself wearing a Dead-inspired Harris-Walz 2024 shirt, alongside a snap of Walz holding the tee and another with his wife, Natascha Münter, holding up a Harris sign. “Well, OK, I guess it all depends on your worldview; you can see your place in the world as something to defend from those who might want to take some or all of it from you—or you can see it as a grand adventure, a place to make dreams come to fruition for yourself and for others,” he wrote in the caption.

	“There is, of course, an in-between place—but the more you lean toward the grand adventure side, the clearer the choice becomes,” he continued. “More good comes from focusing on building a world where disparities aren’t so pronounced that they cause friction and reducing the inequalities that create barriers. With these things in mind, I’ve done my research and come to the clear conclusion that I’ll be voting for @KamalaHarris and @TimWalz this time around.”

	Weir is the latest musician to put his support behind Harris as the presidential election nears. Most recently, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin were among the artists who showed support for the VP after a speaker at a Donald Trump rally made a racist joke about Puerto Rico. Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Billie Eilish, Stevie Nicks, Cardi B, Jason Isbell, John Legend, Katy Perry and many more have also endorsed Harris in recent months.
