Closing the tabs ...
Biden will not be remembered as Sullivan, Clyburn, or his team want him to be. He will be remembered as a failed president who won in 2020 only because of a once-in-a-century pandemic, sent the economy spiraling, watched meekly as the world‚Äôs worst actors lit the world on fire on his watch, and ushered President-elect Donald Trump back into the White House through his failed policies and the cover-up of his deteriorated mental faculties. Even Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äôs loss is on Biden, who picked her in the first place as his running mate and then anointed her to replace him in the race despite her being a terrible politician in her own right.
Biden‚Äôs presidency was reckless, weak, and toxically partisan, a reflection of his own characteristics in his lifetime in politics. No one believes the man who couldn‚Äôt function past 8 p.m. was making his political decisions looking decades into the future.
Ed: Legacies are the true 'final word.' And Biden's legacy is already so clearly bad that his allies are already trying to spin it now before Biden leaves office, which just makes the gaslighting more obvious.¬†

üö®@ScottJenningsKY just dismantled a CNN panel as they attempted to defend Joe Biden‚Äôs legacy:"I think he's going to leave office in disgrace.""The Hunter Biden pardon was disgraceful. He's going to be remembered largely for inflation and for the disastrous Afghanistan‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/V8dvlGW6LT
... pullout. And I think as we continue to we're just getting the first draft of this now."
"But as we continue to learn about the massive cover up that went on, not about his health, but about his mental acuity to cover that up, the efforts, that were undertaken by the White House staff, by his family, not in the last couple of months, but for all four years. I think it's going to be a really ugly chapter."
"I think we still don't know the full extent of what they did to try to hide what they've been doing over in the West Wing."

‚ÄúAlmost from the beginning moment, most visibly seen in the withdrawal, the bloody, unnecessary withdrawal from Afghanistan that emboldened the dictators in Moscow, Tehran, Pyongyang, and Beijing to see America‚Äôs weak, and led, in my opinion, directly to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to the emboldening of our adversaries in the Middle East and the attack on October 7 on Israel.‚Äù ...
‚ÄúHe will be seen as a man who should not have been there in the first place and certainly should never have considered running for his second term cause he was not up to fulfilling and finishing his first term with strength and vigor,¬†let alone trying to seek eight years of office in the White House,‚Äù said Rove.
Ed: Indeed. The decision to pursue a first term was almost as egregious as the decision to seek a second one.¬†

Biden is on vacation AGAIN‚Ä¶He‚Äôs spent 570 days‚Ä¶ 40% of his presidency‚Ä¶ on vacation.I NEVER want to hear a leftist or legacy media clown complain about Trump golfing EVER again!pic.twitter.com/dmyCbsUJZ1
Ed: Presidents are never entirely on vacation, but this is so excessive as to raise questions on its own about Biden's capacity and competence. We'd expect some down time during the holidays, but Congress has been in session as much or more than the White House has in the past four years.¬†

Solar installations have surged to record levels, but the country is not adding enough zero-carbon electricity to meet Biden‚Äôs climate targets.
A $42 billion expansion of broadband internet service has yet to connect a single household.
Bureaucratic haggling, equipment shortages and logistical challenges mean a $7.5 billion effort to install electric vehicle chargers from coast to coast has so far yielded just 47 stations in 15 states.
Ed: Here's another "legacy" question: where did the money go? We'll probably write more on this separately, but kudos to Ezra Klein for highlighting this passage on Twitter today as an one reason why Democrats lost.

pic.twitter.com/P8Y6AbDzRoClay Travis: CBS News journalist roundtable says Joe Biden‚Äôs clear mental and physical decline was the most underreported story of 2024. But true self reflection would demands question ‚Äî why was that? The answer is because most legacy media are Democrat‚Ä¶
===
As part of a roundtable on Face the Nation Sunday, CBS News National and Legal correspondent Jan Crawford was asked by fill-in moderator Major Garrett to weigh in on what she believed to be the most under-reported story of 2024. ...
But observers on the Right felt as though it was Crawford who was doing the gaslighting ‚Äî by not really delving into the why of the media‚Äôs downplaying of the story. Many critics on the Right believe there was ample evidence that Biden‚Äôs cognitive function was in decline ‚Äî long before the debate Crawford cited as the turning point in the coverage.
Ed: I don't have an issue with the way Crawford framed it, except that this was not just the most under-reported story of 2024. It was also the most under-reported story of 2023, 2022, and apparently 2021 as well. When the Easter Bunny corralled Biden from the rope line in April 2022 and prevented him from engaging with reporters and visitors, that should have promoted a lot of questions ... and not one mainstream media outlet except Fox raised the issue at all.

How many times did the legacy media & political elites repeatedly lie about Biden's deteriorating mental condition... and why? ü§î pic.twitter.com/zIxtUMlQPw
Ed: Liars. Every single one of them. And will any of these outlets demand an explanation from them? Of course not!

President Joe Biden uses Jimmy Carter's death to attack President-elect Donald Trump, says Trump could learn something from Carter's "decency"He repeats it 3 times: "Decency. Decency. Decency."pic.twitter.com/PENgU7crFq

‚ÄúThe unmitigated gall of the corrupt Biden lecturing Americans on decency off of Carter‚Äôs death,‚Äù radio host Jorge Bonilla wrote on X.
Another radio personality, Hugh Hewitt, also unloaded on Biden‚Äôs use of the word ‚Äúdecency.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it ‚Äòdecent‚Äô to have deceived the American public for years about your condition and to do so via a complicit and complacent legacy media?‚Äù Hewitt said on the site, referring to the elderly president‚Äôs apparently ailing mental and physical faculties.
‚ÄúThe greatest cover-up in modern American political history, and the greatest media scandal as well, is still unacknowledged on the record by anyone around President Biden and by almost all legacy media figures. Their sunk costs are enormous but they won‚Äôt cut them loose and own the cover-up or the complicity,‚Äù Hewitt said.
