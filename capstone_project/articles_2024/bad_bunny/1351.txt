Actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany appear in video, released days before the US election
The cast of Marvel‚Äôs Avengers movies have come out in support of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris less than a week before the US election.
In a video posted first on Vanity Fair on Thursday evening, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris.
The video, which runs for just over 90 seconds, opens with the actors taking an incoming video call from Johansson. On screen, they brainstorm ideas for a catchphrase for Harris, landing on the dubious ‚ÄúDown with Democracy‚Äù, which they spin into a brief Marvel-style Harris/Walz campaign video with dramatic music and comic-style graphics. The final frame of the video encourages viewers to vote on November 5.
Sharing the video on X, Ruffalo, a vocal Democrat supporter who is best known for his role as the Hulk, wrote: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sit this one out. It‚Äôs the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women‚Äôs reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines. This shit is real and it‚Äôs going to come for you.‚Äù
We're back. Let's #AssembleForDemocracy. In the #ElectionEndgame, every vote counts üó≥Ô∏è #VoteBlue! Vote @KamalaHarris @Tim_Walz pic.twitter.com/Xp7YdUEqxa
Speaking to Vanity Fair about the making of the video, Johansson, who played Black Widow in the Marvel films, said, ‚ÄúIt just immediately turned into people trying to one-up each other with one-liners,‚Äù and joked that Downey Jr and Ruffalo were ‚Äúbickering like two old ladies. And, of course, I‚Äôm the person that‚Äôs just trying to organise everybody. It‚Äôs very similar to what our dynamic is in the films. It was wonderful to feel everybody assemble around it, and hopefully it will engage our fans in the process of voting.‚Äù
Johansson initiated the project, reaching out to her fellow MCU alumni via their group chat and reminding them: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of powerful people on this thread, and it would be great to unite ‚Ä¶ in hopefully creating a bit of a viral moment for Kamala.‚Äù
The Avengers cast join a list of celebrities who have endorsed the Harris/Walz campaign, including Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen and Oprah. In the last week alone, Beyonc√©, Madonna, Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin, LeBron James and the former Republican governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger have all come out in support of Harris.
