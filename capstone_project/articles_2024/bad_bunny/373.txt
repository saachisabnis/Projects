Bad Bunny hasn't been shy about wanting to become a movie star. The Puerto Rican artist has taken a new step towards that goal with a new project, which features a spectacular director and an even better cast. El Conejo will work with two of Hollywood's most popular actors, Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz.
Bad Bunny's return to the big screen marks a significant moment in his acting career, especially following his disappointment with El Muerto, a Spider-Man spin-off by Sony, which he was supposed to star in. Unfortunately, El Muerto faced setbacks and was ultimately shelved, a decision that left Bad Bunny feeling disappointed. In a recent interview, he expressed his regret about the film's fate: "It was a project I was really excited about, and I had put a lot of myself into it. Sometimes things don't go as planned, but I'm grateful for the experience."
According to an exclusive report from the entertainment website Deadline, the Puerto Rican superstar has officially joined the cast of Darren Aronofsky's upcoming crime thriller, "Caught Stealing," produced by Sony Pictures. The film promises to be a thrilling dive into the criminal underworld of 1990s New York City.
Aronofsky, known for his unique and often dark cinematic style, is directing the film based on Charlie Huston's book. Huston will also pen the script, ensuring a close adaptation of the novel's gritty narrative. "Caught Stealing" follows the story of Hank Thompson, played by Butler, a former baseball player who finds himself caught in a dangerous battle for survival against the backdrop of New York's criminal underworld.
Although details of Bad Bunny's role remain under wraps, the cast already boasts a stellar lineup. In addition to Buttler and Kravitz, it includes Regina King, Matt Smith, Liev Schreiber, and Will Brill.
Despite the bad experience with "El Muerto," Bad Bunny hasn't abandoned his Hollywood dreams. His new role in "Caught Stealing" showcases his commitment to expanding his talents beyond music. The artist has previously shown his acting chops in the action-packed Bullet Train (2022), where he starred alongside Brad Pitt. His performance as "The Wolf," a ruthless assassin seeking revenge, was well-received, demonstrating his ability to handle complex characters and intense action sequences.
He also shone in the Gael García Bernal movie "Cassandro."
