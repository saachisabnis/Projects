You can dance off the stresses of 2023 with a little music therapy this year. 
From rap to rock, we've highlighted some of the biggest shows (announced so far) in 2024 for music lovers in the Delaware and Philly area.
The Queen of Pop makes an early stop in Philly on her career-spanning Celebration Tour. Madonna burst onto the scene in the '80s and released classics like "Material Girl," "Papa Don't Preach" and "Like a Prayer." The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer's Celebration Tour paused during the summer when she was sidelined by a bacterial infection that sent her to the intensive care unit. This Philly show was originally scheduled for December. 
Wells Fargo Center (3601 S. Broad St., Philadelphia) at 8:30 p.m., Thursday, Jan. 25. Tickets start at $40-$550. Visit madonna.com or call (215) 336-3600.
R&B lovers will travel back to a simpler time when button-up shirts were purposely left unbuttoned, and baggy jeans ruled with a denim fist. Welcome to the '90s, the era that birthed legendary singer Ginuwine.  
Deion Sanders "Coach Prime" is a fan of the iconic R&B singer who has released big tunes like "So Anxious," "Differences" and "In Those Jeans." Ginuwine is most famous for his 1996 single "Pony," a risqué song that isn't about zoology.   
Bally's Dover Casino Resort (1131 N. Dupont Highway, Dover) at 8 p.m., Saturday, Feb. 24, 2024. Tickets are $60 to $135. Visit casinos.ballys.com/dover or call (302) 674-4600. 
Barbie rapper Nicki Minaj will paint the town pink with a deep catalog of songs to choose from. This includes music from her new album "Pink Friday 2," a project that offers features from Drake ("Needle"), J. Cole ("Let Me Calm Down"), Lil Wayne ("RNB") and others. 
Nicki name-dropped Delaware on her 2012 song "Beez in the Trap," highlighting a list of cities and states where she gets dough. Delaware was one of those places where she "beez" at.

R&B kings The Temptations and The Four Tops both share throne rooms in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame from delivering some of the most famous tunes in American music history. 
The Temptations — which Billboard ranked as the Greatest R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of All Time (even ahead of Michael Jackson) — have charmed music lovers with classics like "My Girl," "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" and "Treat Her Like a Lady." 
Fellow Motown favorites The Four Tops are adored for songs such as "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)," "Reach Out I'll Be There" and "Aint No Woman."

This stop on Green Day's The Saviors Tour offers a tall glass of 1990s rock nostalgia as the headliners are joined by luminaries Rancid and The Smashing Pumpkins, plus the rising band The Linda Lindas. Rock superstars Green Day made their Firefly debut in 2022, headlining the third night of that festival.

Taking Back Sunday plans to party in SoDel this summer, in honor of their newly released album "152."  
The irony of Taking Back Sunday's concert at the Bottle & Cork in Dewey Beach is it falls on a Sunday (Aug. 11, 2024). That show features special guest Citizen.  
Delaware fans were charmed by TBS when the beloved rockers played Firefly Music Festival in The Woodlands of Dover in 2021, the first year the festival was held in September.

Don't be surprised if tickets for Bruce Springsteen's two concerts at Citizens Bank Park sell out. But for now, fans of The Boss can still snag a seat to see him at the home of the Philadelphia Phillies. Springsteen and the E Street Band originally were tapped to play at the stadium last summer. But it was postponed after the rock icon was sidelined by peptic ulcer disease, which forced him to pause the rest of the 2023 tour.     
Citizens Bank Park (1 Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia) Concert #1 at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday, Aug. 21. Concert #2 at 7:30 p.m., Friday, Aug. 23. Tickets for both shows are $59-$320. Visit Phillies.com/Springsteen.
