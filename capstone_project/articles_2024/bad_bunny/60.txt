Bad Bunny is a three-time Grammy and nine-time Latin Grammy Award winning performer. His versatility as a genre-defying artist has catapulted him from Latin trap beginnings to global superstar. Since topping the Billboard Hot 100 with Cardi B and J Balvin on 2018′s “I Like It,” the Puerto Rican megastar has shattered all kinds of records.
In 2020, his third album El Último Tour del Mundo became the first-ever Spanish-language album to top the Billboard 200. That same year, he became Spotify’s most-streamed artist — the first Latin artist at the time to bear the distinction — repeating the feat in 2021 and 2022.
Bad Bunny’s crossover success has made him one of the world’s most in-demand live acts, and El Último Tour del Mundo 2022 became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in Billboard Boxscore history. He shattered his own record on 2022′s World’s Hottest Tour, which grossed $435 million worldwide and became the highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard history. (Ticketmaster)
