Feid has a few instructions for his fans regarding his upcoming tour.
“Prepare the outfit, the apartments, the glasses, the babys,” the 31-year-old rapper shared on Instagram.
He has a point — his upcoming ‘FERXXOCALIPSIS Tour’ is not one you’ll want to miss.
Taking place from April through July, the popular Colombian rapper will be debuting his recently released “FERXXOCALIPSIS” album at arenas all over North America.
That includes Newark’s Prudential Center on Friday, June 7 and New York City’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday, June 16.
And if you want to sing along to “Luna,” “Perro Negro,” “Feliz Cumpleaños Ferxxo” and so many more bangers live, you can grab tickets to all upcoming Feid concerts as soon as today.
Although inventory isn’t available on Ticketmaster until Thursday, Feb. 15, fans who want to ensure they have tickets ahead of time can purchase on sites like Vivid Seats before tickets are officially on sale.
Vivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.
They have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.

In December 2023, Feid dropped his EP “FERXXOCALIPSIS.”
Made up of ten Urbano tracks,  the 31-year-old star spits tight rhymes en español over lush beats.
Personally, we’re most fond of the ultra-catchy “50 PALOS” and  club-ready “LUNA.”
