Over this past weekend, Coachella attendees were treated to a heartwarming moment between two longtime friends and performers, Justin Bieber and Jaden Smith. A video that surfaced online, courtesy of user @daydayred_, shows the memorable encounter where 25-year-old Smith spontaneously hugged 30-year-old Bieber and swayed with him to the music, culminating in a friendly kiss on the cheek from Bieber.
The two icons opted for casual styles, befitting the relaxed atmosphere of the famous music festival held in Indio, California. Smith stood out in an eye-catching turquoise puffer vest paired with baggy shorts, while Bieber complemented the look with his own baggy shorts, layered with a crisp white sweater vest and topped off with a backward baseball cap.
