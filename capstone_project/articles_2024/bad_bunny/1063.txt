Colombian superstar Karol G joined her boyfriend Feid on stage during the grand finale of his 'Ferxxocalipsis' tour to perform several songs along with him. However, one specific moment melted the hearts of the audience.
The guest performers throughout the three concerts marking the end of the most significant tour of Feid's career in his hometown of MedellÃ­n was nothing short of spectacular. The list included Rauw Alejandro, Bad Bunny, Myke Towers, J Balvin, Jowell & Randy, Ã‘ejo, DFZM, and Sky, but the most special guest was Karol G, who publicly dedicated a song to himâ€”a song many suspected was in fact about him, but has now confirmed with this heartfelt gesture.
"I can't believe I'm about to sing this song to you," Karol G sweetly said to Feid before performing her hit 'Mi Ex TenÃ­a RazÃ³n.'
"With you, beach days feel even hotter. Because of you, I forgot the past and hold no grudges. Baby, in bed, you healed everything that hurt me, you made my heart beat where it didn't before. I truly believe you when you call me 'my love,'" she sang in Spanish, visibly nervous while delivering the romantic lyrics.
Feid, who didn't take his eyes off her for a moment, appeared equally nervous but didn't let that stop him from dancing to her rhythm and playfully giving her a flirtatious tap.

Karol G also shared heartfelt words for her boyfriend: "Congratulations, baby, on your success, to you and your whole team. You're the idol anyone would dream of meeting. I love you."

Feid was overflowing with happiness, celebrating this romantic moment on such an important day, with over 45,000 fans attending the tour's finale.
From the moment Karol G appeared on stage, Feid proudly introduced her to the packed Atanasio Girardot Stadium in MedellÃ­n. He let her shine, performing several of her hits while providing backup vocals.
One standout moment was her performance of 'El makinon,' one of Karol's biggest hits, originally featuring Mariah Angeliq. This time, fans got to experience Feid singing it alongside her.

The duo also fueled rumors of marriage or an upcoming wedding after singing 'Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido,' passionately performing the line, "I'll marry you; your name sounds perfect with my last name." Karol playfully added, "Can you imagine Villada Giraldo?" as Feid gazed at her lovingly.
