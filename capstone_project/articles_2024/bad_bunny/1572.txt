Latina actress Aubrey Plaza has embraced her Puerto Rican roots to voice her political views.
With early voting underway and Election Day fast approaching, political tensions in the United States are rising. Rallies and events featuring candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are in full swing, urging citizens to vote.
Known for her role in Disney's 'Agatha All Along' and NBC's 'Parks and Recreation,' Plaza seized the opportunity to respond onstage at the Wall Street Journal's Innovation Awards gala on October 29. During her time on the microphone, Plaza directed a powerful message at Trump and, notably, at comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who spoke at Trump's recent rally on October 27.
At the rally, Hinchcliffe made a controversial comment, calling Puerto Rico "a floating island of garbage." In response, Plaza didn't hold back, addressing the hurtful remark on behalf of her Puerto Rican family, especially her grandmother, who she imagined would have also spoken out.
"I just wanted to quickly address the racist joke made at Trump's rally about Puerto Rico, where most of my family is from. Thankfully, my sweet grandma wasn't here to hear that disgusting remark. But if she were alive today, I think she'd say, 'Tony Hinchcliffe, go f--- yourself,'" Plaza stated at the WSJ awards.

Plaza wasn't alone in her condemnation. Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi also voiced his disapproval on Instagram, calling out the wave of discrimination faced by Puerto Ricans and reminding his followers that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.
"We do not stand for this constant hate. It's clear these people don't respect us, yet they want our vote. I wrote this in English on purpose because, yes, we are also Americans," Fonsi stated.
As the election draws closer, several prominent Latino artists, especially Puerto Ricans, have taken a stance. Stars like Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin have shown support for Kamala Harris, sharing the Democratic candidate's campaign messages on their social media.
With less than a week until polls open, early voting has already begun, and the United States is gearing up for one of the most closely contested elections in recent history.
