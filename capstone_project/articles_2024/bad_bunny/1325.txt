Fat Joe has some words for his fellow Puerto Ricans who are still supporting Donald Trump in the presidential election.
In part one of the Breakbeat Media News special Us: A Summit on Black & Brown Men & The Vote published on Friday (November 1), the Bronx native addressed those who still plan to vote for the former President despite comments at his recent rally calling Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage.”

“It breaks my heart…” Joe began. “If any of you guys got Puerto Rican friends, when you go over there and you go visit, the first thing they tell you is, ‘My island, my island. Yo you went to my island.’ How the hell are they gonna call Puerto Rico an island of garbage and when I post on my Instagram, ‘These the guys you voting for?’ I see Puerto Ricans saying, ‘No we’re still for Trump 2024.’ That’s that house n-gga mentality. That’s the Latino that wish he was white. Those the guys in the comments, you know?
“[They] change they voice up [and] try to sound white, trying to fit in. Those the guys I’ve been fighting my whole life because they look at me like, you know, what I am.”
Speaking at Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night (October 27), comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe told the crowd: “There’s a lot going on, like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.”
Immediately following Hinchcliffe’s comment, Bad Bunny took to his Instagram account and shared – multiple times – a video of VP Harris detailing her plans for Puerto Rico to his 46 million followers.

“I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,” Harris says in the clip, referring to his handling of 2017 Hurricanes Irma and Maria. “He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes, and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.”
Fellow Puerto Rican superstars Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin also shared Harris’ video, as did Fat Joe.

For his part, Hinchcliffe has since defended his statement as “a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist.”
