When you bring home a puppy, they have a lot to learn and often times need some motivation and encouragement to try new things. Take Sophi the Australian Shepherd puppy for instance. She finds the stairs at home very scary, and it takes lots of courage and gentle prodding from mom to finally conquer going downstairs for the first time.
Mom shared a video at the end of June sharing Sophi's first successful trip down the stairs, and it's absolutely adorable! You can see Sophi's anxiety and trepidation about trying to get down the stairs. Make sure the sound is on so you can hear Sophi go from nervousness to proudness as she makes her way down!
Yay Sophi! She was such a brave, big girl for taking on the stairs! Sophi's not a puppy anymore, but these are the kinds of memories all parents cherish. @tailsof2puppers agreed, "How incredibly brave! Great work!" Another commenter shared, "Awww the little bunny hops! My doggy was like that when he first went down the stairs and now it’s fun for him." @Suneedae added, "She got an A+ for 100% effort!!!

The Australian Shepherd, lovingly referred to as Aussie for short, is one of the most popular breeds in the United States according to the American Kennel Club. They are known for their high energy levels and intelligence, which make them easily trainable. They are fun and will chase a ball until they drop. They are entertaining dogs with big personalities and are known to be hardworking and make great assistance dogs. If you're a very active family who loves to stay busy, an Aussie might make the perfect addition to your family.
Did you know that Aussies didn't actually originate from Australia? The AKC shared that the breed, "probably came from the Basque region of Spain. Basque shepherds first took their dogs with them to Australia and then to the United States, so Americans called the dogs Australian Shepherds. The breed, as we know it today, was developed solely in the United States."
When was the first time you ever saw an Aussie dog? Many of us saw them at rodeos; the small happy dogs herding horses and bulls. That's actually where they gained their popularity, as they are one of the most popular herding breeds around. At rodeos they pulled double duty; not only did they herd the bulls, but they also performed tricks to entertain the crowd.
Aussies are also known for their beautiful eyes. It's one of just a few breeds that commonly have two different colored eyes, called heterochromia. Some Aussies can even display more than one color within the same eye! And if you're not into dogs that shed, steer clear of Aussies. The AKC shared this funny joke, "Some owners will claim that their Aussie only sheds twice a year…for six months at a time." If you bring home an Aussie, you'll need to brush them at least once a day, and vacuum just as often.
My mom and dad have an Aussie and he's the coolest dog ever! As with any pet, make sure to do your research to learn the good, the bad, and the ugly about the breed to see if it will be a good fit with your family. I think an Aussie is a little too high energy for my family.
