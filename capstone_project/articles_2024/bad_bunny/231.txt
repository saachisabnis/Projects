Al Pacino’s ex-girlfriend Noor Alfallah stepped out with their son, Roman, amid her rumored romance with comedian Bill Maher. 
The 30-year-old film producer was photographed walking out of a coffee shop with her 1-year-old and their nanny in Los Angeles on Saturday. 
She held the toddler on her hip with her coffee in the other hand as she cautiously crossed the street. 
Alfallah led the way and her nanny walked shortly behind while pushing an empty stroller. 
The mom of one kept it casual, wearing a black cropped hoodie, matching sweat pants and Nike sneakers, accessorizing with black sunglasses and a dainty necklace.
As for Roman, he sported a long-sleeve top and tan joggers.
Alfallah’s sighting comes after she was spotted leaving the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles with Maher, 68, last weekend.
The duo, who wore formal evening wear, appeared relaxed while driving away from the ritzy hotel in the TV personality’s black sedan.
The outing was reportedly not Alfallah and Maher’s first date and the two have allegedly been spending a lot of time together recently, sources told People.
The outlet reported that the rumored couple have been on several dates and consider each other “friends” for now.
Alfallah and the political commentator’s sighting turned heads, especially since she was believed to be dating Pacino, 84.
The “Godfather” star’s rep, however, clarified that he and Alfallah were “just friends” and “co-parents” to their son.
“Al and Noor are very good friends, have been for years, and are co-parents to their son Roman,” his rep told People on Oct. 7, a day after she was seen with Maher.
Pacino also told the outlet that he doesn’t have relationships, saying, “I have friendship.”
The “Scarface” star and Alfallah were first romantically linked in 2022, and the two welcomed a son together a year later.
