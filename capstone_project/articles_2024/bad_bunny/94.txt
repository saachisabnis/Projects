Happy Gilmore 2 is on the horizon and Adam Sandler has dropped another teaser ahead of the upcoming sequel. 
Calling in to The Dan Patrick Show recently, Sandler discussed what fans could potentially expect from the Netflix production. He said at the beginning of the interview, “They’re going to yell at me no matter what, because they asked me to not do any press. But what do you want to say and I’ll tell you if it’s good or bad to talk about.” Patrick later asks about the potential Eminem cameo, to which Sandler responded, “I’ve known Eminem for a long time and he’s a great guy.” He goes on to confirm his involvement, “He came in and was funny as hell. I think we hung out a day with Eminem and we just shot and shot and it was insane. Said a million things we can use and a million things we’re glad we have on tape.”
Sandler also took the opportunity to confirm that retired pro golfer Jack Nicklaus would also have a cameo and even revealed that they are aiming for a summer 2025 release, “Not July 4th, but we’re trying to get it done in time for July.” Other cast members confirmed include the return of Ben Stiller, Christopher McDonald and Julie Bowen. New additions include Nick Swardson, Benny Safdie, Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley and Travis Kelce. Watch the full interview below.
