As for Kendall and Bad Bunny, the two were were first linked in February 2023 and dated seemingly until December when the news of their break up began to circulate. The Kardashians star and the “Tití Me Pregunto” singer sparked dating rumors after they were seen walking out of Wally’s in Beverly Hills, California on February 18, 2023, according to TMZ. The two left after Hailey and Justin Bieber were seen walking out of the same restaurant. Kendall left right before Bad Bunny through a different exit with security in tow. Kendall was wearing leather pants, black boots and a gray oversized jacket while Bad Bunny wore a similar color palette with a brown jacket and a khaki-colored hat.
In February 2023, sources told People that the pair were “spending time together.” According to one insider who spoke to the publication at the time, Kendall and Bad Bunny were introduced by mutual friends after the Puerto Rican rapper purchased a new home in Los Angeles. “She likes him and is having fun,” the source shared. “He is different from guys that she dated in the past. He is very charming.”
Another source told Entertainment Tonight the pair were having fun and keeping things casual at the time. “Kendall and Bad Bunny are attracted to each other and definitely have a flirty vibe,” the source shared. “It is still new, but they’re enjoying each other’s company and like each other. They have mutual friends and had dinner with Hailey, Justin and friends at Wally’s in Beverly Hills on Saturday night. It’s been fun for both of them so far.”

 









Soon after, they were seen at a Met Gala afterparty together in May. Sources told People that the two may be becoming exclusive and are in fact “getting more serious”. “They are very cute together. Kendall is happy. He is a fun guy. Very much a gentleman and charming. She likes his vibe. He is very chill.” 
The insider continued, “It was a slow start, but they spend almost every day together now. He hangs out with her friends and she hangs out with his. It’s more of a relationship now. Kendall is not seeing anyone else. She really likes him.”
News of their breakup was first reported by People in December. “Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,” said a source to Entertainment Tonight. “They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn’t be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go. They have crazy busy schedules and know they’re still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.”

 









The source clarified that there “isn’t any negativity between them and they still want the best for one another. Kendall’s family still thinks highly of him. They just want her to be with whoever makes her happy, treats her with love and respect, and someone that understands and can handle the attention that comes along with dating her with poise and grace.”
