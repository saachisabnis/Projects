Apple Music has officially revealed what it has deemed as the greatest album of all time.
The music streaming service has finished sharing its list of the 100 best albums in history, by exclusively revealing the top 10 choices on TODAY May 22.
Lauryn Hill's 1998 masterpiece, “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” earned the honor of the No. 1 album. “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” powered by singles “Doo Wop (That Thing),” “Ex-Factor” and “Everything Is Everything,” garnered 10 Grammy nominations, winning five, including album of the year and best R&B album. The album was Hill's first and only studio album.
“This is my award, but it’s a rich, deep narrative, and involves so many people, and so much sacrifice, and so much time, and so much collective love,” Hill told Apple Music about her spot at the top of the album list, per a press release.
In the release, Apple Music called the album “a seismic event ... a stunningly raw, profound look into the spiritual landscape not just of one of the era’s biggest stars, but of the era itself."
“She was, and remains, a once-in-a-generation talent whose inspiration and innovation can be heard through the decades," the release read. "Artists exhaust long discographies hoping for a cohesive piece of work resonant enough to reshape culture and inscribe its creator into the pantheon; Lauryn Hill did it in one.”
Michael Jackson's landmark 1982 effort, "Thriller," took the second spot on the list.
"There are few pop albums, or even works of art, that denote a wholesale shift in time and space the way Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller' did in 1982," Apple Music described in the release.
"It did nothing less than define the modern pop blockbuster and redefine the scope and reach of music. Seven of its nine original cuts were top 10 singles, and it became one of the bestselling albums ever made."
The rest of the top 10 featured other big names, including Beyoncé, The Beatles and Nirvana. Find out where those albums placed on the top 10 list and which others made the cut on Apple Music's 100 Best Albums, below:
