The Palm Springs Art Museum will conclude its “Mixed Feelings” lecture series Thursday, which features talks on seemingly unrelated topics that are somehow connected.
The back-to-back lectures “Bad Bunny” and “The Light and Space Movement” will close out the series at 6 p.m. in the museum’s Annenberg Theater, 101 North Museum Drive.
Each event in the series features two speakers who are paired to discuss their respective areas of expertise, and the audience then has an opportunity to connect the two subjects during a Q&A session.

The series began in October with lectures on “Vegan Meat” and “The Representation of Zombies,” and continued with “The History of Broadway Musicals” and “Deep-Sea Diving” in November; talks on “Exoplanets” and “Contemporary Native Art,” and “Susan Sontag” and “The Salton Sea” in December; and “Boxing Culture” and “Queer Photography” in January.
“The series was started as `Mixed Taste’ by Palm Springs Art Museum’s current CEO Adam Lerner when he was at the helm of the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver,” museum spokesman Scott Slaven said. “He introduced `Mixed Feelings’ to the Coachella Valley in 2022.”
Tickets for the lectures, each $16, can be purchased at psmuseum.org/events/.
