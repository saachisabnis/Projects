Met Gala excitement has reached fever pitch.
This year’s co-chairs, including Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, stepped out in style while attending Anna Wintour’s pre Met Gala dinner in New York City on Sunday, May 5.

She elevated her dress — which featured butterfly and floral embroidery — with diamond earrings from Bulgari.
Lopez, 54, meanwhile, stunned in a strapless Diana Qerimi velvet gown featuring rhinestone embellishments. She accessorized with a satin Tyler Ellis bag, peep toe heels from Casadei and Yeprem jewelry.
