The Adidas Gazelle, the most natural of so-called Samba alternatives, is getting an official treatment for the Jamaican Football Federation. 
The Adidas Gazelle “Jamaica” should have instant appeal for those from the country and the many who love wearing the nation’s flag and colors. Yellow suede takes up the most real estate on the upper, while the nation’s colors continue with black leather stripes and a green leather mustache. While the upper and laces use a mustard yellow, the more traditional color is used for the leather liner and insole. A white tongue then hosts Adidas’ embossed trefoil logo in green, while the mustache and insole hosts the crest for the Jamaican Football Federation. Rounding out the shoe is a translucent gum outsole.

Jamaica joins a host of nations whose Adidas-sponsored football federations have been given their own iterations of the Gazelle. Last fall, Adidas released an assortment for Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Italy and Germany. Now, the only nation in the world with a flag that doesn’t feature red, white or blue joins the fun.

The Gazelle has benefited from a halo effect generated by the Samba, and historically the silhouette has been known for featuring more colorful variants than its sister soccer shoe. It’s also been the subject to a number of popular collaborations this summer, including multiple colorways from Clot and Bad Bunny. 
The Adidas Gazelle “Jamaica” will release August 22 through Adidas’ website. Pricing is set at $110.
