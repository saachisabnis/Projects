Musician Bad Bunny took in Day 14 of the 2024 US Open on Sunday in an ensemble befitting of the tennis event. Bunny joined a long list of A-List stars, including Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, who attended the matches in Flushing, New York over the weekend. The “Un Verano Sin Ti” rapper wore a short wool suit as well as white lace up white Adidas sneakers.
Bunny slid into a roomy gray jacket as well as knee length shorts for the outing. Under the jacket, he wore a simple white T-shirt that he matched with a white hat and tall white Adidas socks. The Grammy winner looked polished while also maintaining a relaxed look that’s appropriate for a sports outing.

For shoes, the Puerto Rican superstar chose the sold out Adidas Adizero Adios 7 Running Shoes. The style is event appropriate as it is light with a mesh upper, for speed. It also includes a Continental Rubber outsole for additional traction that aids in sharp movements.

The shoe is also sustainable: it is composed of recycled plastic and polyester. 
The Adidas Adizero Adios 7 is currently sold out but can be purchased on eBay for $160. 
It’s little surprise that the performer is wearing Adidas. The Reggaeton star has been a brand collaborator since 2021. Though he hits red carpets wearing high fashion labels like Christian Louboutin (he wore the company’s Maison Margiela collaboration to the 2024 Met Gala) and Bottega Veneta, he’s often spotted off-duty in Adidas styles. Earlier this month, he wore the brand’s puffed up IIInfinity mules. 
Last month, Bad Bunny put his Adidas Gazelle Indoor “Benito” sneaker on sale. It can be purchased now. It will begin shipping to customers on Sept. 11 and will be available in stores Sept. 21.
