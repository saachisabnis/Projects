Max introduces a new hospital drama in January, and it hails from one of the longtime producers of ER, John Wells, and one of its longtime stars, with Noah Wyle starring in The Pitt. Each episode follows one hour of one shift of Wyle’s character job working in a Pittsburgh hospital.
That sounds interesting, but personally I am most excited about the arrival of All Elite Wrestling on streaming. Previously exclusive to TBS and TNT, the company’s two weekly TV series, AEW Dynamite and AEW Collision will begin a streaming simulcast on Max starting in January. Max is also adding a bunch of older AEW programming to its library as well; to start, much of it comes from the federation’s first year of existence.
Here’s everything coming to Max in January 2025...
