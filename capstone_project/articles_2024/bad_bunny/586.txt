Shaboozey isn’t necessarily happy with the results, but he’s officially conceded one of the most contentious elections of 2024: People‘s “Sexiest Man Alive” contest.

	Following the announcement that John Krasinski had won the coveted title this year, the 29-year-old country star jokingly tweeted his opposition to the results. “Should’ve been me…but the people have spoken,” he wrote.

	But for what it’s worth, ‘Boozey also offered a kind word to the Office star: “Congratulations @johnkrasinski,” he added with a single-tear emoji.

	Though it isn’t known who People was officially considering for the role of Sexiest Man — which last year went to Patrick Dempsey, who followed previous winners Chris Evans, Paul Rudd and Michael B. Jordan — the “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” singer was publicly in competition with Harry Styles, Role Model and Zach Bryan for the “Sexiest Musician” category. That honor, however, ultimately went to the “Watermelon Sugar” artist.

	Other musicians nominated in this year’s smattering of sexy categories were Bad Bunny and Post Malone — who both lost out to The Bear star Jeremy Allen White for sexiest tattoos — and Joe Jonas, who earned the title of “Makes BRAT Look Sexiest.”

	But while things didn’t go Shaboozey’s way this time, the Virginia native is fresh off a major career win. On Friday, the announcement of the 2025 Grammy nominations revealed that he’s up for awards in five categories, including best new artist. His “Spaghettii” duet with Beyoncé is also in the running for best melodic rap performance, while his Billboard Hot 100 smash “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — currently in its 17th week at No. 1 on the chart — was recognized for best country solo performance, best country song and song of the year.

	“GRAMMY NOMINATED BOOZEY!!!!!!!! I LOVE Y’ALL, THANK YOU @RecordingAcad !!!!” he reacted to the news on X Friday. “We did it!!!!”

	Shortly afterward, Shaboozey gushed about the honors in an interview with Billboard. “The most exciting part about all this is being able to listen to your music and be like, ‘Damn, I’m not capping anymore,'” he said. “‘I really got that Grammy that I talked about in that song I made in 2014!’ Manifestation, man. Now I can really talk my sh–!”
