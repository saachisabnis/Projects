An artist that has won several Grammy Awards and is one of the top-selling Latin artists in the world disappoints fans by cancelling a concert just days before it was meant to happen.
The Target Center was supposed to be hosting the show on Saturday night, but according to the Star Tribune, poor ticket sales may have led to the cancellation, they pointed out that less than half of the available tickets through Ticketmaster were sold, ticket prices ranged from $122 - $600.
No reason was given for the cancellation, the only information posted about the event is from Ticketmaster, they simply say, "Unfortunately, the Event Organizer has had to cancel your event."
Ticketmaster says that those who bought tickets to see Bad Bunny's Most Wanted Tour will automatically be refunded the price of the ticket and nothing needs to be done. Those who bought tickets from other sources are out of luck, as the original purchaser will get the refund.
This is surely a huge disappointment for fans of Bad Bunny, as it has been over 6 years since the "M√çA" hitmaker performed in Minnesota, and it looks like that drought will continue into the foreseeable future.
The Puerto Rican hip-hop star has won several Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, he has also won an American Music Award for Best Album, and several others including an MTV Music Award and various international music awards.
