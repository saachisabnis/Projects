	North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson (Kenan Thompson) competed on The $100,000 Pyramid against Saturday Night Live host Jean Smart, with the actress playing a woman married to a chimpanzee.

	The scandal-plagued Republican gubernatorial candidate had no shortage of incorrect answers to prompts given by rapper Bad Bunny (Marcello Hernandez). 

	Rather than answer “dancing” when asked about the most common thing to do in a club, Robinson replied, “Cheat on your wife.” And when the prompt was, “It feels good in the moment, but you always regret it,” Robinson didn’t guess the correct phrase “Getting too drunk.” Instead, he said, “Commenting ‘I’m a black Nazi‘ on a pornographic website.” 

	Yet Robinson’s competition–Smart teaming up with podcaster Haliey Welch–didn’t do much better.

	Smart’s answers in the category “things babies need” all had something to do with primates: “banana” instead of “pacifier,” “cage” rather than “crib,” and so on. One answer was correct, though: “breastfeeding.”
