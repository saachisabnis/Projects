NBA YoungBoy has shown his YouTube dominance once again, becoming the United States’ second-most streamed artist of the year overall, and the most streamed Hip Hop artist.
According to YouTube Charts, the Baton Rouge native was only bested by Mexican singer Peso Pluma overall.
NBA YoungBoy beat out such artists as Drake, Bad Bunny, and even Taylor Swift.
Both YoungBoy and the 6 God have been dominating the streaming game for quite some time.

As for Drake, Chart Data reported that the Canadian superstar was “the #1 most streamed rapper on Spotify in 2023, with over 17.6 billion streams.” It is worth noting that Taylor Swift broke the record for the most number of streams in a single year on the platform, confirming Drizzy’s “Red Button” bar: “Taylor Swift the only n-gga that I ever rated.”

With both artists generating monumental digits, it’s clear that they’re still running the game.
Last month, Metro Boomin set the record straight regarding his alleged beef with Drake. The superstar producer took to Twitter in late December and responded to a fan who brought up the tension between him and the 6 God.
“Are u and Drake seriously beefing or is it not that deep?” one social media asked the producer, to which he replied: “Not deep at all lmao.”
