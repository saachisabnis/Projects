Accompanying her was her daughter, Chicago, aged six, together they supported Saint from the sidelines, embodying the spirit of a closely-knit family.
In a heartwarming display of sibling affection captured on Kim's Instagram Story, she shared a clip with the caption: “Saint promised his sister when he made a basket he would come and do a special handshake with her!” 
True to his word, after scoring a basket, Saint rushed to his sister, sharing a special handshake followed by a sweet kiss on the cheek. 
This tender moment, observed and celebrated by Kim with an "Awww!" and a declaration of "That is so funny!", showcased the genuine joy and playful interactions that define their family life. 
Kim punctuated this sentiment with emojis conveying her emotional response to the adorable exchange between her children.
Kim, a devoted mother to four—sons Saint, Psalm, 4, and daughters Chicago and North West,10, shared by her with ex-husband Kanye West, frequently shares glimpses into their family dynamics and her children's accomplishments.
