Palmer later revealed she and Jackson had broken up in October 2023 and filed a temporary domestic violence restraining order against him in November, which was granted. Jackson replied with a suit stating Palmer was the "primary aggressor," and Palmer dropped the restraining order.
A rep for Bad Bunny later claimed that Benito had not approved of the text with the tweet being shown onstage, saying, “The request from the artist during the visuals for ‘El Apagón’ performance was to use the image only and not text from the tweet, which we take responsibility for and correct it for Friday’s performance.”
The two have been enemies since being cast in The Lords of Flatbush together. They famously didn't get along, and Gere was fired.
Lorde later said, “I love Wes [Pentz, Diplo’s real name], and he’s a big brother to me and one of my first friends in the industry, and part of having a friendship with someone like that is not letting them say stupid shit. Taylor’s my friend as well, and I’m a girl, and if I see some weird body-shaming on my feed, I’m going to be like, ‘Hey man…’ We do still love each other, hopefully.”
Hilson later expressed her admiration of Beyoncé and said the two had had a "healing" moment: "She actually has introduced herself. It was a gracious moment. I appreciated it. I feel like she understood what happened, what had transpired and there was a bit of healing in that moment when we met. I take her as a very intuitive kind of soul, as am I." She also said of the lyric, "I made a decision that was not authentic to who I truly am, and of course, I regret it. Of course," though on another occasion, she'd said she didn't write her own lyrics at that time.
