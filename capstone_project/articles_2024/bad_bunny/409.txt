SAN ANTONIO - Grupo Frontera has announced their highly-anticipated “Jugando a Que No Pasa Nada” tour, complete with a stop in San Antonio.
Tickets for the Aug. 17 show at Frost Bank Center will go on sale May 17 at 10 a.m. local time.
Their “Jugando A Que No Pasa Nada” tour across North America comes on the heels of the release of their second album of the same name.
Grupo Frontera has rocketed to success since being formed in 2022, having gone viral with their cover of “No Se Va” last year.
The award-winning band from Edinburg, Texas, has also been featured by acts such as Bad Bunny, Christian Nodal, and Shakira, to much fanfare, having accrued millions of views online.
Tickets will be available from the Frost Bank Center Website as well as Ticketmaster.
