Daddy Yankee is coming out of retirement to bring his loyal fans a refreshing song, and it's iHeartRadio's latest World Premiere.. On Friday, April 26, the Puerto Rican legend dropped his brand new track "LOVEO." On the Xound-produced song, Daddy Yankee raps about living side-by-side with God through the good and bad times. Daddy Yankee's latest song comes six months after he tried to retire from the music industry. "He accompanies me when I'm right and when I'm wrong/Of the consequences that I cause myself," he raps on the song. "Let me learn, but don't leave me alone/He has me down, I don't even get out of control anymore."
The veteran reggaetónero, born Ramón Ayala, announced his plan to leave music behind and devote his life to Christianity during the final night of his “La Meta” tour last December. “Tonight, I recognize, and I am not ashamed to tell the whole world that Jesus lives in me and that I will live for him,” he told fans according to Variety. “For many years I’ve tried filling a hole in my life that no one could fill. I tried finding a purpose, on many occasions, it seemed as if I was happy but something was missing for me to feel complete.”Yankee had been preparing fans for his exit prior to the release of his Legendaddy album. The 19-track album contains collaborations with Bad Bunny, Becky G, El Alfa, Lil Jon, Myke Towers, Natti Natasha, Nile Rodgers, Rauw Alejandro, Pitbull, Sech and more.Listen to Daddy Yankee's new song below.
