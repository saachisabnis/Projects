In an interview with Infinity Sports Network (via Fightful), Damian Priest said that he wants to have a rematch against Bad Bunny so that he can get his win back against him. The two wrestled in a street fight at WWE Backlash last year, which Bunny won.
Priest said: “Yes, I would definitely welcome a rematch because I didn’t get the win. I need to get that one back. The success of it goes into the work we put in. I’ll say this about Bad Bunny, for a celebrity, an outsider who is not from this world, the amount of work that he put in and the rigorous training he went through knowing that he has this huge career that he should be focusing on, it speaks to the volumes of the type of entertainer he is. He was willing to put in the work. Our fans, his fans, and everyone in between was proud that he didn’t just come in to take someone’s spot or to promote a song or a movie. He came in because he was a fan and wanted to do the business justice. I know because I was the one who originally trained him. I’ll say this, my man could take a hit. He’ll say ow, but he’ll get back up and say let’s do it again. It was impressive to see what he was willing to put himself through. Then when it came time for us to feud and have a match, he was game and got himself in better shape and a trainer and what not. We went out there and I think the island helped a lot, that atmosphere and vibe of that coliseum definitely helped us put on a better show. I feel like in our business, we live through the fans and we need that energy. That’s how we know what we’re doing is working, so the fact that they were on fire just made it easier for us and we killed it.“
