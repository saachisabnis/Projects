“Barbie” has reason to smile Sunday evening, having won the movie of the year prize along with other trophies at the 2024 People’s Choice Awards at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica.
Margot Robbie won for female movie star of the year for her lead role as Barbie and Ryan Gosling won for male movie star of the year for his turn as Ken. And in the movie performance of the year category, “Barbie” took home another honor, courtesy of America Ferrera.
Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” the top nominee coming into the night with seven, including a nod for comedy show of the year.
Taylor Swift took home four prizes, and might deserve credit for a fifth — boyfriend Travis Kelce’s win for the athlete of the year award. Kelce plays tight end for the Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs.
The winners are decided solely by fan voting, differentiating the ceremony from Hollywood’s other honors that are generally voted upon by others in the industry.
“Barbie” co-star Simu Liu hosted the event. Adam Sandler received the People’s Icon Award, while Lenny Kravitz received the Music Icon Award. Kylie Minogue and Lainey Wilson performed.
