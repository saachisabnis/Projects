Jennifer Lopez will reportedly take the stage at a Kamala Harris campaign event in Las Vegas on Thursday.
The Puerto Rican, Bronx-born singer is set to address the crowd just days after one of the opening acts at Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden denigrated Latinos and called Puerto Rico a “floating pile of garbage.”
Lopez will appear with Mexican rock band Maná during the Sin City gathering of Harris supporters, according to Rolling Stone.
Lopez joined a list of influential Puerto Ricans, including fellow musicians Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin, to take a stand after Trump’s Sunday gathering in Manhattan.
Trump called the rally a “lovefest” and declined to denounce the comedian who made those remarks, claiming he doesn’t know entertainer Tony Hinchcliffe.
“Someone put him up there,” Trump told ABC News.
Lopez has so far used her Instagram account to energize voters. On Tuesday, she posted a performance of her 1999 song “Let’s Get Loud” where she shouts for Latinos to make their voices heard. The song includes a sample of “Born in the USA” by fellow Harris supporter Bruce Springsteen.
Pop superstar Beyoncé and country music legend Willie Nelson showed up with Harris when she campaigned in Houston last week. Harris was also endorsed by Taylor Swift, who hasn’t joined her on the campaign trail.
Polling shows Trump and Harris in a tight race in Nevada exactly one week before Election Day.
