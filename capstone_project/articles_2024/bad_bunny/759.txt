Chris Hemsworth did not follow the all rules at this year's Met Gala, and was quick to admit to his fault. 
According to E!News, the "Avengers" actor confessed to taking a bunch of selfies with wife Elsa Pataky at the event, even though cellphone use is not permitted. 
"Heaps of selfies. Selfies everywhere. A lot of selfies in my phone. Like, 'When did I take that? Let's delete that one.'"
Hemsworth donned a cream-colored Tom Ford suit next to his wife, a vision in a sparkly-gold, high-neck gown with matching jewelry, both perfectly capturing the "Garden of Time" theme of the evening. The "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga" standout praised the Met Gala, noting that he and Elsa had a really fun night. 
Hemsworth not only made his Met Gala debut this year, but was also asked to host the illustrious event alongside Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Zendaya.
