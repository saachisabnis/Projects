“Raygun”, the break dancing competitor from Australia in the 2024 Paris Olympics is going viral for all the wrong reasons. 36 year old competitor Rachael Gunn failed to impress the judges with her break dancing skills. She failed to receive a single point in the competition.
Her dance moves were so bad people thought it must be a hoax.  “Raygun” who says her dance moves were inspired by her surroundings, jumped around as a kangaroo, bunny and she slithered like a snake. She also managed to throw in some sprinkler moves.
“I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves,” Gunn, who has a Ph.D. in cultural studies and studies breaking and hip hop culture. “So I wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative because how many chances do you get that in a lifetime to do that on an international stage,” said Gunn. She qualified for the Olympics by winning last year’s Oceania Breaking Championships. She didn’t get many points there either.
Breaking was added to this year’s Olympics in an effort to connect with a younger audience — but it may never see the five rings again.
Breaking is not part of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. It is not Raygun’s fault. She is actually being applauded by strangers including singer Adele.
Rachael Gunn said, “Go out there and represent yourself. You never know where that’s gonna take you.”
