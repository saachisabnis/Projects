We lucked up, let’s put it that way.”

Parton and Dean first crossed paths in 1964 shortly after she moved to Nashville to become a singer. They met outside a local laundromat and tied the knot two years later.
"I guess kind of in the back of my mind I was maybe flirtin' a little," Parton recalled in a 1970 interview with The Tennesseean. "But mainly I was just bein' friendly because I'd always been the kind of person who would speak back and smile.”
Dean stayed out of the public eye throughout his nearly 60-year marriage to Parton, but she gushed about him from time to time. Parton announced in March 2025 that Dean died at age 82.
“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together,” the singer wrote in a statement. “Words can’t do justice the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.”

Jackson and Richardson met in 1970 while attending Morehouse College and Spelman College, respectively, which are both located in Atlanta. The pair got married in 1980 and celebrated their golden anniversary in August 2020.
“50 years ago we started dancing, it was all fun & games. 40 years ago today, shit got real,” Jackson gushed via Instagram. “The slow drag of our lives pressed together, I led sometimes, sometimes she did. We finally found that rhythm where there was no leader, we moved as one. We’re still glued together, hip to hip, a holding each other up, not covering as much of the floor, but owning & loving the space that’s ours.”
He added, "You for keeping me on my toes & on the beat for 18,250 days. You make my soul 🎶sing‼️ Don’t change the tune, we’re not done dancing.”
Three years later, Richardson directed Jackson in The Piano Lesson on Broadway, for which he scored a 2023 Tony Award nomination.
Together, they share daughter Zoe, who was born in 1982.

Martin and Janet have been married since 1961, going on to welcome four children. Two of their sons, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez, have followed in their father’s acting footsteps.
After celebrating their 54th anniversary in 2016, Martin opened up to Closer about how Janet “saved” him during his past heart attack. (Martin suffered a heart attack at the age of 37 while filming 1979’s Apocalypse Now, a notoriously plagued production.)
“There was a struggle to get me to a hospital because we were in a remote area of the jungle. My wife, Janet, was running down the corridor, and I was on a gurney being wheeled in, and I looked up and saw her face,” Martin recalled. “She leaned down and whispered, ‘It’s only a movie, babe. Please, it’s only a movie!’”
He added, "It was very serious, and she handled it like a pro. She had me laughing in the most dire circumstances. She said, ‘Don’t take yourself so seriously.’”
According to Martin, they didn’t make a big fuss of their anniversary because “every day is a celebration with this dame.”

The Boy Meets World alums, who also played a married couple on the ‘90s sitcom, wed in 1951 after initially meeting as students at Northwestern University.

The pair adopted sons Michael and Robert in 1964 and 1966, respectively, after the stillbirth of son William.

The Walkens first met in 1966 when they were both cast as dancers in a touring production of West Side Story. Christopher and Georgianne dated for three years before tying the knot in 1969.
"Every once in a while — certainly not often — I’ll be looking out the window, and I’ll think, I feel pretty good,” Christopher told The New York Times in February 2022. "My bills are paid, my wife is healthy, the weather’s nice. That’s really all I care about: when, apropos of nothing, I happen to look out the window and think, This is good.”

The actor was first enamored with now-wife Shakira when he saw her onscreen in a Maxwell House commercial that aired on British television in 1971. After a mutual friend passed along the former pageant queen’s phone number, Michael got in touch to request a date.
“I fell in love with her in about eight minutes. It took her two hours to fall in love with me,” he joked to Radio Times in October 2018. “We don’t need anybody else except the family. We’re very happy in our own company. And we all of us, no matter how nice and loving and lovely we are, all have a slightly bad side. Shakira is the only person I ever met who didn’t have a bad side. There’s no bad side. It’s all good.”
Michael and Shakira wed in 1973, going on to welcome daughter Natasha. (Michael is also the father to daughter Dominique from a past relationship.)

The Happy Days alum started dating Cheryl in high school, going on to get married in 1975. They later welcomed four kids — Bryce Dallas, Jocelyn, Paige and Reed — and still remain happily in love. 
"People say, ‘How’d you do it?’ There’s no technique. There’s no tactic other than communication is really important. You have to learn to communicate and have difficult conversations in constructive ways,” Ron told People in 2019. “Beyond that, there’s an element of luck because people either grow together or they don’t and I don’t think you can force that.”
