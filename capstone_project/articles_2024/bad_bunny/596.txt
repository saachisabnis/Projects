In a triumphant return to the music scene, Puerto Rican indie duo Buscabulla, composed of Raquel Berrios and Luis Del Valle, has unveiled their latest single, “11:11.” This track marks their first original release since their groundbreaking debut album ‘Regresa’ in 2020—a work that resonated deeply with fans amidst the global pandemic.
‘Regresa’ was a beacon for unexpectedly homebound listeners, offering solace through its deeply personal narrative of Berrios and Del Valle’s return to Puerto Rico after over a decade in New York. The album didn’t just capture the hearts of fans; it also garnered the attention of global superstar Bad Bunny. Their creative synergy culminated in the hit song “Andrea,” featured on Bad Bunny’s chart-topping ‘Un Verano Sin Ti,’ where Buscabulla was given complete artistic liberty.
Now, with “11:11,” Buscabulla ushers in a new era. Named after Berrios’ angel number, the single signifies a fresh, intentional chapter for the duo. “You have a purpose, and you have to fulfill it,” Berrios reflects, encapsulating the ethos of this next phase in their musical journey.
Already a strong contender for the anthem of Summer 2024, “11:11” draws its rhythmic heartbeat from merengue and a tapestry of Caribbean sounds. It’s a nostalgic nod to the music that colored Berrios and Del Valle’s childhoods, evoking memories of their mothers’ cleaning day soundtracks.
