Bad Bunny has paid $8.3 million for a nearly 1,600-square-foot house in the Bird Streets of L.A.’s Hollywood Hills.
The Grammy Award-winning reggaeton artist from Puerto Rico, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, bought the home at 9300 Flicker Way in an off-market deal, according to the Robb Report. 
The seller was Ariana Grande, who took a loss on the deal. The “Positions” singer bought the three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in the trendy neighborhood east of Beverly Hills’ Trousdale Estates in early 2021 for $8.9 million. 
Add L.A.’s new Measure ULA “mansion tax” and closing costs, and the Florida native likely lost more than $1 million on the 0.74-acre property, according to Robb.
Tax records say the property is made up of three contiguous parcels on a steep hillside. The home, hidden by tall hedges at the end of a long driveway, was built in 1946, and renovated in 2020.
The cottage includes a two-car garage, large outdoor patio and a dark-bottom swimming pool, with views of the Sunset Strip and West Hollywood.
Grande, 30, is known for buying and selling Los Angeles real estate.
Last year, she spent nearly $5 million to buy a secluded Hollywood Hills house from Cameron Diaz, according to Robb.
In 2020, she bought a new home at 9127 Thrasher Avenue in the Hills’ Bird Streets neighborhood for $13.7 million. She then sold it a year later for $14 million, according to The Real Deal.
In 2021, she snagged a historic 5,500-square-foot estate in Montecito from Ellen DeGeneres for $6.75 million, according to Architectural Digest. 
Bad Bunny, 29, known as the “King of Latin Trap,” has a larger estate in the Hollywood Hills he bought last year for nearly $9 million, according to Robb. In 2022, his touring grossed $230 million, while he also had the world’s best-selling album, topping Beyoncé, Drake and BTS.
