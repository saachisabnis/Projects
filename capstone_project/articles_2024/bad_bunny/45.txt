The 32-year-old was scheduled to headline One MusicFest in Atlanta on Saturday, alongside performances from US stars Nelly, Fantasia, and band Earth, Wind & Fire.
“I am so sad to share this news, but I’ve been in the hospital recovering from a medical emergency the last couple of days and I won’t be able to perform at One MusicFest,” she wrote in a statement shared on social media.

“It breaks my heart that I won’t get to see my fans this weekend and I really wish I could be there.
“Bardi Gang – thank you for understanding and I’ll be back better and stronger soon.”
The I Like It rapper signed off the post telling fans “don’t worry”, adding in the caption: “Thank you guys for understanding… I will see you soon.”

Cardi B already shares two children with Offset: six-year-old daughter, Kulture; and three-year-old son, Wave.
The rapper – real name Belcalis Almanzar – rose to fame on VH1’s Love & Hip Hop: New York before launching her solo music career.
Her hit songs Bodak Yellow and I Like It, featuring Bad Bunny and J Balvin, on her first and only album, Invasion Of Privacy, secured her a Grammy for best rap album.
The rapper has continued to be a prominent name in the industry by releasing hit collaborations including joining Maroon 5 for 2018’s Girls Like You and Megan Thee Stallion for 2020’s WAP.
