The Brain Dead x adidas Stan Smith releases in 2024, featuring a vintage aesthetic. Also debuting in 2024, the Bad Bunny x adidas Gazelle Indoor brings a unique design to sneaker enthusiasts.
Brain Dead and adidas Collaborate on Stan Smith for 2024 Release, Featuring Unique Vintage Design

Kyle Ng of Brain Dead is renowned for his innovative designs and collaborations. Once again, he has made a significant impact in the footwear industry by partnering with adidas to reimagine the iconic Stan Smith. According to Sneaker Bar Detroit (SBD), this collaboration merges Brain Dead's distinctive aesthetic with classic elements, captivating sneaker enthusiasts and fashion devotees with its blend of modernity and heritage.
The Brain Dead x adidas Stan Smith maintains the traditional white and green color scheme while introducing a unique, weathered appearance that sets it apart. This worn look imparts a vintage aspect to the sneakers, enhancing the design's character and depth. The Brain Dead logos are perforated on the sides, effectively incorporating the brand's identity into the silhouette.
The tongue of the sneaker features an adidas Stan Smith logo, "Endorsed by: Brain Dead," along with one of Brain Dead's faceless insignias. This branding underscores the collaboration and mutual respect between the brands. Olive green eyelets provide a subtle contrast, while frayed bright green laces add a playful irreverence. The worn aesthetic is complemented by a cream-colored outsole, which unifies the design.
The Brain Dead x adidas Stan Smith is packaged uniquely, embodying the collaboration with the Three Stripes logo positioned within the Brain Dead cranium. The sneakers are expected to be released in 2024 and will be accessible through Brain Dead's website, select retailers, and adidas.com.
This collaboration is eagerly anticipated. Sneaker enthusiasts should mark their calendars and stay vigilant for this exciting release. This distinctive blend of modern and classic design is to be noticed.

Bad Bunny and adidas Originals to Release Gazelle Indoor in 2024, Showcasing Unique Design
Bad Bunny and adidas Originals are expanding their partnership with a new colorway. The Puerto Rican sensation is set to reveal his unique interpretation of the adidas Gazelle Indoor following the successful releases of the Forum, Campus, and Response CL footwear. This latest collaboration is expected to combine Adidas's emblematic design with Bad Bunny's distinctive aesthetic.
The new Gazelle was first spotted in Bad Bunny's Interview Magazine feature. Grey suede overlays and black Three Stripes branding complement the pure white upper of the initial colorway. The shoes are distinguished by their unique warped toebox and heel logo, completed by a Gum Brown rubber outsole.
The Bad Bunny x adidas Gazelle Indoor is set to be released in the summer/fall of 2024 and will be available at select adidas Originals merchants, both in-store and online, as well as on adidas.com.
