Peso Pluma, the vibrant force in the world of corridos tumbados, has been admitted to a rehabilitation clinic in Jalisco, reported Mexican magazine Quién, citing as a source the Spanish paparazzo who revealed Gerard Piqué infidelity with Clara Chía, while he was still with Shakira. This news comes on the heels of his breakup with Argentine singer Nicki Nicole and the controversial cancellation of his performance at the Viña del Mar Festival.
Jordi Martin, a well-known Spanish paparazzo, shared exclusive insights with the magazine, revealing that Peso Pluma's decision to seek help wasn't spontaneous. The 24-year-old singer's life has been a whirlwind of highs and lows, marked by his recent split and the intense scrutiny surrounding his Viña del Mar Festival participation, which was met with criticism over his lyrics that some argue glorify drug trafficking and violence.
The clinic, Maluri (or 5 Lunas de Maluri), is a holistic rehabilitation center nestled in Jocotepec, Jalisco, on the scenic Chapala-Jocotepec road. Known for its commitment to spiritual growth, the center specializes in treating addictions and emotional illnesses. This isn't Peso Pluma's first stint in rehab; he had previously sought treatment at this very facility in 2023.

The ripple effects of Peso Pluma's current situation are evident. Jordi notes that not only was his Viña del Mar show canceled, but also his entire Latin American tour. His Instagram, once a window into his colorful life, now holds a solitary post dated February 23, outlining the dates for his Exodo Tour across the United States, including two weekends at the Coachella festival in April.
The rest of his digital footprint seems to have vanished, mirroring the actions of his ex-girlfriend Nicki Nicole, who recently erased all traces of their relationship from her Instagram.

Speculation about Peso Pluma's past troubles with addiction had been rampant even before his rise to fame, and his current troubles. In a candid interview with CNN, he opened up about how songwriting has become his solace and therapy against depression since his teenage years.
His musical journey is as eclectic as his life experiences. Having lived in New York and Texas, Peso Pluma worked various jobs, from waiting tables to construction, before his music took off. Once aspiring to be a professional football player with the Chivas de Guadalajara, he shifted his focus to music, a decision that has led to remarkable achievements.
Before canceling his South American tour, Peso Pluma had to cancel his shows in Mexico, after he was threatened by organized crime in that country. Before achieving international fame, much of his music told stories about the life of druglords.
This year, Peso Pluma surpassed Puerto Rican sensation Bad Bunny as the most searched artist on YouTube, with over 4 million subscribers and a record-breaking presence on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs, Peso Pluma has undeniably left his mark on the music world.
