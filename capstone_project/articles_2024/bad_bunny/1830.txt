Rita Ora has made history as the first person to host the MTV European Music Awards for the third time this year, at the star-studded ceremony held at Manchester's Co-op Live Arena.
It comes after organisers were forced to cancel last year's event in Paris due to security fears amid the Israel and Hamas war. 
Taylor Swift leads the 2024 nominations with seven nods, while Raye, Shawn Mendes and Teddy Swims will be performing to the huge crowd of 20,000 fans. 
During the show host Rita will also reportedly pay tribute to late pal and One Direction star Liam Payne, following the singer's tragic death aged 31 last month.
The One Direction singer fell 45ft from the third floor into the courtyard of the Casa Sur Hotel in Buenos Aires.
A source claimed the tribute could range from a musical performance of Liam's hits to a video looking back at his time in showbiz.
They told The Sun: 'In the coming days they will start drawing up official plans. Officially Rita is yet to be announced, but she is hosting this year's awards and will be involved in whatever MTV decides to do'.
'She and Liam have been close for years and grew in the industry together. Obviously she is devastated by his passing'.
