Production only began on the sequel to Adam Sandler’s 1995 cult classic comedy “Happy Gilmore” earlier this month, but Netflix intends to get the movie out fast.
OutKick is reporting that the project, which is currently shooting in New Jersey, will be available to stream in March/April 2025 – a filming to release time of just 5-6 months.
The news was let slip by famed 58-year-old golfer John Daly who appears in the film.   In a video interview with The Gunz Show, he revealed he has already shot all his scenes and then indicated the potential release date before whispering ‘shhh’.
Kyle Newacheck (“Murder Mystery”) is directing the film which doesn’t require much in the way of visual effects, and so post-production should move relatively swiftly.
The 1995 film, Sandler plays a failed hockey player who finds unexpected success on the pro golf tour and became a massive home video hit.  It remains one of Sandler’s signature roles.
The new film sees returnees Christopher McDonald and Julie Bowen who will be joined by Nick Swardson, Benny Safdie, Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley, Maxwell Jacob Friedman, Travis Kelce and Daly.
