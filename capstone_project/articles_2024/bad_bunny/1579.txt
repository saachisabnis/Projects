	Over the course of Billboard Boxscore’s 40-year history, Latin music artists have made their mark on stage with sold-out tours across the Americas. Here, Billboard is running down the 10 highest-grossing concert tours by Latin acts – here, defined by artists eligible for Billboard’s Top Latin Albums and Hot Latin Songs charts – in the Boxscore archives.

	After decades of growth, Luis Miguel became the first Latin artist to gross more than $100 million on a single tour, reaching a new peak on the Mexico Por Siempre Tour in 2018-19. But while Miguel opened the doors, a flood of acts broke down the walls with outsized post-pandemic treks.

	Nine more Latin tours have crossed the $100 million threshold since 2022, with four of them continuing throughout 2024.

	Due to inflation and an explosive ticketing market, it makes sense that recent tours are topping the revenue-based list. But beyond those general economic factors, Latin music has gone through explosive growth in the 2020s. Reggaeton, pop and Regional Mexican artists have broken ground on cross-genre charts like the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100, not to mention the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. tallies. Likewise, they have joined classic rock bands, pop stars and rappers among the most successful touring acts.

	Not only are the highest-grossing Latin tours from the last few years, but so are the best-selling Latin tours in Boxscore history. Five tours by five different acts have sold more than 1.5 million tickets, while no pre-pandemic Latin tour had hit 1 million.

	Here, scroll through the 10 highest-grossing Latin tours in Billboard Boxscore history. This list is based on figures reported to Billboard Boxscore as of Sept. 24, 2024.
