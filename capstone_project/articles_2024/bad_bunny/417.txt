The Met Gala, the crown jewel of fashion extravaganzas, is poised to dazzle once again as it prepares for the 2024 edition on May 6. Vogue recently unveiled the star-studded lineup of co-chairs for this year’s gala, and it’s a roster that promises to make the event a night to remember.
Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth are set to lead the glamorous affair as co-chairs, bringing a diverse and dynamic mix of talent to the prestigious event. While Zendaya and Lopez are seasoned Met Gala veterans, this marks Hemsworth’s debut and Bad Bunny’s third appearance, adding an exciting blend of experience and fresh energy to the co-chair lineup.
Known for their individual style statements, Zendaya and Lopez have become synonymous with Met Gala glamour. This year marks Lopez’s impressive 13th appearance at the gala, while Zendaya, with her iconic looks like the Joan of Arc chain-mail dress in 2018 and Cinderella-inspired ensemble in 2019, continues to be a standout presence on the red carpet. The duo’s fashion-forward choices are sure to set the tone for the evening.
In addition to the co-chairs, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, a longstanding Met Gala chair member, will join them, along with honorary chairs Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. This impressive lineup hints at an unforgettable night, with attendees likely to include significant others such as Tom Holland (Zendaya’s boyfriend), Ben Affleck (Lopez’s husband), Gabriela Berlingeri (Bad Bunny’s girlfriend), and Elsa Pataky (Hemsworth’s wife).
Given the honorary chairmanship of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, this year’s guest list is expected to feature influential TikTok personalities, including Dixie and Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Emma Chamberlain, and more, bringing a contemporary touch to the gala.
The Met Gala’s theme for 2024, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” promises a captivating showcase with approximately 250 items, including significant pieces spanning over 400 years of history. Curated around three main zones—Land, Sea, and Sky—the exhibit pays homage to the natural world. According to Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, the exhibition is “an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.”
As for the dress code, Vogue announced “The Garden of Time” inspired by J.G. Ballard’s 1962 short story. The theme revolves around “fleeting beauty,” with attendees expected to interpret it through outfits depicting “melancholic florals,” music, and timeless archival pieces. This imaginative and thought-provoking dress code is sure to inspire a diverse array of stunning ensembles.
With an illustrious co-chair lineup, a theme rooted in the natural world, and a captivating dress code, the 2024 Met Gala is poised to be a celebration of creativity, glamour, and fashion innovation. As the fashion world eagerly awaits the first Monday in May, expectations are running high for another unforgettable night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
