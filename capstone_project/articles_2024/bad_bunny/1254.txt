Vogue announced yesterday that this year’s Met Gala will take place on May 6th, co-chaired by Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth. The event will coincide with the Metropolitan Museum Of Art Costume Institute’s “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibit.
The dress code theme is ‘The Garden Of Time,’ which Vogue described as having “nothing to do with the Brothers Grimm or Disney,” but “a celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can’t ever be worn again — and are therefore sleeping beauties in the scrupulously maintained archives of The Costume Institute.”
The Met Gala, which always takes place on the first Monday of May, is one of the biggest nights of the year for fashion and Hollywood. The guest list is invitation-only and all A-listers.
12 a.m.-6 a.m.
