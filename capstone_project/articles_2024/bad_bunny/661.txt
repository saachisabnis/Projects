Midnight in Paris looks a little different when you’re a multi-millionaire. 
Kendall Jenner went barefoot during a private late-night tour of the Louvre earlier this week, causing a stir online.
Between Paris Fashion Week shows, the 28-year-old model spent most of her time exploring the City of Love alongside rumored boyfriend Bad Bunny. 
In fact, the lovebirds seemingly rented out the famous Parisian museum on Tuesday for a lavish date night.
“The Louvre at midnight,” Jenner captioned photos standing in front of some of the most famous art pieces in the world — including the Mona Lisa. 
Although the “Kardashians” star ditched her shoes for the late-night escapade, she wore a long black skirt with an asymmetrical hemline and a backless black top. 
While the “Me Porto Bonito” singer, 30, was not pictured in the Instagram carousel, fans joked that they knew “who took these pics.”
Meanwhile, other users couldn’t help but comment on the model’s lack of footwear in the famed art gallery. 
“We get it. You’re so filthy rich you can get the louvre to open at midnight just for you to walk barefoot around the historic halls 😭😩,” one user commented. 
“Where are your shoes girl 😭,” another asked, which a third dittoed, “I’m so thrown off by barefeet at the Louvre.”
While wearing footwear is typically an unspoken rule at most indoor facilities, the Louvre doesn’t state that shoes are required anywhere on its website. 
Before their stop at the famous art museum, the duo made separate cameos at Vogue World: Paris on Sunday, where Jenner arrived on horseback while Bad Bunny put on a short performance.
They were also spotted at an event for Fwrd, where Jenner serves as a creative director, and at celeb-loved restaurant Ferdi. 
For their romantic date night, the couple coordinated in matching light gray looks, with the hitmaker rocking a slightly oversized suit and the model showing off her svelte physique in a skintight set from sister Kylie Jenner’s brand Khy. 
The reality TV star and the Puerto Rican rapper first sparked dating rumors in February 2023. Although things briefly fizzled around the holidays, the two were linked again in May 2024.
At the time, a source told Entertainment Tonight that they were “not necessarily back together or an exclusive item” but seeing where it takes them. 
“There’s a strong connection between them whenever they’re together and they have the same chemistry that they’ve always had,” the insider said. 
“It’s casual, easy and comfortable between them,” they added.
