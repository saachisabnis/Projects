Lopez was spotted wearing the Saint Laurent Vendome Boots in Glazed Leather. The boots features a skinny stiletto heel of just over four inches and is made entirely of calfskin leather.
Made in Italy, the shoe includes a buckle strap as decoration at the ankle and offers a sharply pointed toe. It is available from Saint Laurent for $1,950. Pointed toes, as pumps and as boots, have been trending lately.
The “This Is Me” performer loves additional height when it comes to shoes. While in New York City recently she’s been sporting a variety of platform styles. This has included a platform Ugg, a white K-Swiss sneaker, as well as a Timberland-style boot from R13. She’s also been seen in a super tall platform sandal while on a date night with husband Ben Affleck. But she’s certainly not afraid of other styles: she notably wore an embellished pair of green Versace stiletto boots in images that have been credited with launching Google Images. 
Lopez has also designed footwear, having partnered with Giuseppe Zanotti and DSW. Her Zanotti line launched in 2017. In 2019 she was presented with the Fashion Icon award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
