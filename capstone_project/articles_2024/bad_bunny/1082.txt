Taylor Swift, Snoop Dogg and Khloe Kardashian snubbed offers to appear in Jennifer Lopez‘s film.
The 54-year-old singer managed to get the likes of Kim Petras, Post Malone, Keke Palmer, Sofia Vergara and Jane Fonda to appear in ‘This Is Me … Now‘ about her search for love, but not everyone her team asked was able to take part in the project.
In a new Amazon Prime documentary “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” one of her team members said Taylor, Khloe and Snoop Dogg were among those who couldn’t take part.
In addition, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Vanessa Hudgens and Bad Bunny were also either unavailable or turned down the offer.
J-Lo herself admitted she also wanted Jennifer Coolidge and Jason Momoa to take part.
“People scared, scared to put themselves out there. I get it. Took me a long time. I’m scared. I don’t act like I’m scared. That’s the secret to my whole career,” J-Lo said pondering the reasons for people turning down the film.
Meanwhile, she revealed Anthony Ramos – who has starred in A Star Is Born and In The Heights – snubbed the offer because of her friendship with J-Lo’s ex, Marc Anthony.
“Anthony Ramos was going to do this. He was going to do the ‘Rebound’ number with me. And he was like, ‘Ah, I’m friends with Marc,'” Jennifer told wardrobe supervisor Shawn “Beezy” Barton during rehearsals in the documentary.
“I didn’t know that you and Marc were good friends. I didn’t know that. That’s nice,” J-Lo responded.
The pop star – who has 16-year-old twins Max and Emme with Marc – insisted she would never intend to call out “the father of my kids” in the film.
“I’m never going to do anything that’s going to really pinpoint him out,” she explained.
“Yeah, I just think that people are going to think that … You know how the media is,” the actor replied.
J-Lo argued that people shouldn’t be making art “thinking about what the media’s going to say.”
