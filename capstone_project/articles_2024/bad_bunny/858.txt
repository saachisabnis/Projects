It's no surprise that Taylor Swift was the highest-grossing touring artist of 2024. According to a new report by Pollstar, her record-breaking Eras tour raked in $1.043 billion in 2024 (and $2.2 billion since it launched in 2023). What might be more surprising is that a rock tour came in second place. Coldplay's Music of the Spheres tour has been breaking records of its own, and in the process grossed $421.7 million over the past 12 months.
In fact, four out of the Top 10 tours of the year were from rock artists. Bruce Springsteen came in fifth place, with The Rolling Stones right behind him, and Metallica was #9. See the full list below.
