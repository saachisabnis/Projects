	The 2024 Billboard Latin Music Week is in full swing, and while panels and Q&As take centerstage during the day, showcases are the place to be at night.

	On Tuesday (Oct. 15), Rimas Publishing celebrated its 10th anniversary with a special showcase that featured performances by Valentina, Slow Jamz and Anonimus with surprise guests, including Randy (of Jowell & Randy). The showcase, which kicked off at 9 p.m., was held at M2 in Miami.

	Rimas Entertainment is celebrating 10 years in business, and Randy was one of the first artists to be signed to the indie label. Now, the company — also home to global superstar Bad Bunny — has evolved and launched multiple divisions, including Habibi (management company home to Karol G and Grupo Frontera) and Rimas Sports.

	










	Before the showcase took place, Noah Assad (CEO), Junior Carabaño (vp) and Raymond Acosta (general manager, Habibi) took centerstage during Billboard Latin Music Week for a panel during which they reflected on the company’s growth and what they look for in an artist.

	“In terms of management, Raymond tells me, ‘Here is this opportunity.’ And I respond with, ‘What do you think?’ And if he says I love them, then so do I,” Assad said. “Sometimes I don’t see the vision, but someone else on the team will. If that person believes in an artist, we know there’s a reason. We trust that team member who identifies an artist and says, ‘I can do this for this person.”

The 2024 Billboard Latin Music Week coincides with the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Awards set to air at 9 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 20, on Telemundo. It will simultaneously be available on Universo, Peacock and the Telemundo app, and in Latin America and the Caribbean through Telemundo Internacional.
