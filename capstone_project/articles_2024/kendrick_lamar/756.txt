The OVO store in London was tagged up with lyrics by Kendrick Lamar amid the Compton rapper's beef with Drake. On Tuesday, May 7, photos from the scene of the crime surfaced on social media. The photos show the front of Drizzy's OVO store on Carnaby Street in London with silver graffiti on the main window. The message reads "They not like us," which are also lyrics from K Dot's recent diss track "Not Like Us." As of this report, no one has claimed the artwork and police haven't identified any suspects.  
The store was vandalized around the same time a shooting occurred outside of Drake's home in Toronto. According to local news outlets, a security guard, who was posted outside of the gates in front of the property, was shot in the chest during an apparent drive-by shooting around 2 a.m. The man was rushed to a local hospital. He was listed under critical condition but is expected to recover. So far, Drake himself has not commented on the situation. As of this report, there's no confirmation on whether or not the shooting had anything to do with the conflict between Drake and Kendrick Lamar. During a press conference held in front of the home, police said they are aware of the beef but they are still not sure if the shooting is connected. It's also not certain Drake was home at the time of the shooting, but his team is cooperating with police. Watch the press conference in full below.
