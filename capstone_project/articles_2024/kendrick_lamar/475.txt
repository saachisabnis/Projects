TK Kirkland expressed a strong desire for Kendrick Lamar to step aside and let Lil Wayne and Cash Money headline an upcoming Super Bowl performance. Kirkland highlighted Kendrick's previous performance with Dr. Dre but emphasized it's not the same as headlining. He drew parallels to how T.I stepped down for Gucci Mane, suggesting Kendrick could similarly elevate Lil Wayne, who Kirkland sees as a crucial figure for New Orleans. TK portrayed Lil Wayne and Cash Money's potential Super Bowl performance as a monumental event for New Orleans, still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Katrina. Kirklandâ€™s heartfelt plea is centered on the cultural and emotional uplift this could bring to the city.
