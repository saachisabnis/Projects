Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, logs a fifth total and consecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. The song, Post Malone’s sixth leader and Wallen’s second, is the first to notch at least its first five weeks on the chart at No. 1 since Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” spent its first six weeks on the survey at the summit in January-March 2023.

	“I Had Some Help” is also the first hit to spend five consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 overall in nearly a year, since Wallen’s “Last Night” linked 10 straight frames on top, of 16 total, in May-July 2023. The former also ties for the most weeks in the lead in 2024, matching Jack Harlow’s “Lovin On Me” (which tallied five of its six weeks at No. 1 this year).

	Meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter boasts two songs in the Hot 100’s top three – marking her first appearances in the tier – as “Please Please Please” debuts at No. 2 and “Espresso” ascends to a new No. 3 best. With the tracks, which introduce her album Short n’ Sweet, due Aug. 23, she becomes the first soloist – and just the second act overall, after The Beatles 60 years ago – in the Hot 100’s history to place two initial top-three hits with no other billed artists in the region simultaneously.

	Plus, Hozier earns his first No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart with “Too Sweet,” at No. 7 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 1, and Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” makes an 11-9 flight on the Hot 100, becoming her seventh top 10.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 22, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 18.

	Below is a rundown of the latest Hot 100’s top 10.

	“I Had Some Help,” on Mercury/Republic/Big Loud, adds a fifth week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, with 66.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 12%), 43.3 million official streams (down 5%) and 12,000 sold (down 12%) in the U.S. June 7-13.

	The collaboration keeps at No. 2 after it led the Streaming Songs chart in its debut week; rises 5-3 on Radio Songs (as it pushes 3-2 on the Country Airplay chart, 8-7 on Adult Pop Airplay and 10-8 on Pop Airplay); and dips 3-4 after two weeks atop Digital Song Sales.

	“I Had Some Help” concurrently sizzles atop the multimetric Songs of the Summer chart for a third week and Hot Country Songs for a fifth frame.

	Sabrina Carpenter scores two songs in the Hot 100’s top three – marking her first appearances in the region – as “Please Please Please” debuts at No. 2, becoming her second top 10, and “Espresso” rises to a new No. 3 best, from No. 6 (after it previously reached No. 4).

	“Please Please Please” opens with 50.3 million streams, 533,000 in airplay audience and 7,000 sold in its first week. “Espresso” drew 47.7 million in radio reach (up 18%), 38.4 million streams (up 27%) and 28,000 in digital and physical sales (up 366%) in the same span. The former was released June 7, alongside its official video starring Carpenter’s boyfriend, Oscar-nominated Saltburn star Barry Keoghan. She performed both songs during her set at New York’s Gov Ball music festival the following day. The tracks introduce her album Short n’ Sweet, due Aug. 23.

	Making history, Carpenter is the first soloist – and just the second act overall after The Beatles, 60 years ago – in the Hot 100’s nearly 66-year history to place two initial top-three hits with no other billed artists in the region simultaneously. Here’s a recap of their achievements:

	(Akon, DaBaby, DJ Khaled, Iggy Azalea, Ludacris and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have also charted their first two top-three Hot 100 hits in the bracket simultaneously, although not with pairs of songs without other billed artists.)

	“Please Please Please” concurrently launches as Carpenter’s first Streaming Songs No. 1 and her second Digital Song Sales top 10 (No. 7), while “Espresso” wins the Hot 100’s top Streaming and Sales Gainer awards.

	Hozier’s “Too Sweet” holds at No. 7 on the Hot 100, following a week at No. 1 in April, as it becomes his first No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart (70.5 million in audience, up 7%). In his lone prior Radio Songs appearance, he peaked at No. 3 with his breakthrough hit “Take Me to Church” in 2015. “Too Sweet” also becomes his initial No. 1 on Pop Airplay.

	The track concurrently leads the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart for a 10th week and Hot Rock Songs and Hot Alternative Songs for an 11th week each.

	Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” ascends 11-9 on the Hot 100. It drew 30.7 million streams (up 8%) and 3.2 million in airplay audience (up 221%) and sold 3,000 (up 9%) in the tracking week.

	The singer-songwriter adds her seventh Hot 100 top 10, and second from her new album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, following the No. 5-peaking “Lunch.”

	Here’s a rundown of Eilish’s Hot 100 career top 10s:

	Elsewhere in the Hot 100’s top 10, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” holds at No. 4 after reaching No. 3.

	Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” slips 3-5 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 2, as it takes top Airplay Gainer honors (46.1 million in audience, up 31%) for a second week. It leads the multimetric Hot R&B Songs chart for a seventh week and rebounds for a second week at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

	Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” descends 5-6 on the Hot 100, after led in its debut week in May, and returns to the top of the multimetric Hot Rap Songs chart for a fifth week in charge.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Eminem’s “Houdini” falls to No. 8 a week after it debuted at No. 2 and Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which led for a week in March, drops 8-10.
