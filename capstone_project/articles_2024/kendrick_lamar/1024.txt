With features from The Weeknd, Chris Brown, Ty Dolla $ign, Lil Baby, A$AP Rocky, and a surprise appearance from J. Cole, reports suggest the disc could perform even better than its predecessor.
Their previous album, We Don’t Trust You, debuted with slightly over 251,000 equivalent album units just a few weeks ago – making for the highest sales week of the year at the time and Future’s second biggest ever behind What a Time To Be Alive, his 2015 collaboration with Drake.

We Don’t Trust You also marked Future’s ninth number one album and Metro Boomin’s fourth.
It’s worth noting that a majority of the album sales were powered through streaming, with the LP’s 17 tracks clocking up 324.31 million streams.

The album boasted the much talked-about “Like That” which landed atop Billboard’s Hot 100.
The incendiary track, which features a guest verse from Kendrick Lamar aimed at Drake and J. Cole, initially moved over 500,000 equivalent units, making it the fastest song to hit that milestone in 2024.

On the song, Kendrick took shots at Drake and Cole, first referencing their chart-topping collaboration “First Person Shooter.”
“Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches,” he rapped.

He then spat: “Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum, what? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack.”
The Compton native also referenced Drake’s album For All The Dogs: “N-gga, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary.”

Weeks later, Drake, who appeared to be taking the high road seemingly responded with a diss track of his own. On Saturday (April 13), a bar-heavy joint hit the internet that addresses a number of Drizzy’s ongoing beefs.
“You better do that motherfuckin’ show inside the bitty/ Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/ Then we need a verse for the Swifties,” the voice raps, referring to K.Dot’s previous crossovers into pop music.

About A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd recently joining the battle and throwing shade at Drake, the song continues with a reference to Kendrick comparing himself to Prince and his adversary as Michael Jackson: “What the fuck is this, a twenty-V-one, n-gga?/ What’s a prince to a king? He a son, n-gga.”
Additionally, the song also takes shots at J. Cole (who recently withdrew from the war of words) and Rick Ross while suggesting that SZA deserves a spot in the Big 3 more than Kendrick.

Initially uncertain if the OVO boss was behind the song, he later seemed to confirm on Instagram that his leaked diss track, “Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50),” is authentic.
