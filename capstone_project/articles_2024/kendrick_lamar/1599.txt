Part 2: Gary Owen on J. Cole Apologizing for Dissing Kendrick: He Was Reading Comments
--------
Comedian Gary Owen defended Drake's use of the n-word amidst criticisms from Kendrick Lamar. In a recent diss record, Lamar challenged Drake on the use of the term. Owen rebutted Lamar's claims, arguing that one ounce of Black blood allows an individual to identify as Black and, therefore, use the n-word. Owen points to mixed-raced individuals' societal classification as Black as tacit approval of this reasoning. Interestingly, he added that most militant individuals tend to be of mixed race and support Black causes enthusiastically, citing his own daughter as an example. He ends the discussion humorously, relishing the rap battle between Lamar and Drake, reminiscent of legendary rap feuds of the past.
