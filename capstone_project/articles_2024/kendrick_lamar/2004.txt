	Produced by FNGRS CRSSD, the event has been a mainstay on the Southern California dance festival circuit since 2015, when it launched as a boutique destination for house and techno fans in SoCal, a market then dominated by dance megafestivals like EDC and HARD.

	CRSSD’s 2024 spring festival (another follows annually each fall) welcomed roughly 15,000 fans per day, along with headliners including Tale of Us, Armand Van Helden, Jeff Mills and Lane 8. Additionally, the event hosted a flurry of crucial rising and veteran artists including SYREETA, Joris Voorn, Trym and X Club. Hear exclusive sets from these four acts below.

SYREETA

	Ending her debut U.S. tour with this CRSSD appearance, the London-based producer opened her set with a spacious, slow-build edit of Kendrick Lamar’s 2012 classic “Swimming Pools,” shifted into Latin rhythms, a subtle remix of Eminem’s “Superman” and then put her foot on the gas for an hour of fresh, sophisticated house music. 

Joris Voorn

	The Dutch mainstay played an evening set on the festival’s City Steps stage, opening with Infamous Zol’s lush 2019 production “Nocturnals” before ramping up into 90 minutes of progressive house and melodic techno that altogether helped segue the festival from day to night. 

Trym

	French DJ Trym wasted no time getting into it, starting his set with heavy-hitting techno and maintaining a very high BPM for the duration of his March 2 headlining set on the festival’s City Steps stage. 

X Club.

	On Saturday, the Australian duo played to a packed late afternoon crowd on CRSSD’s City Steps stage. There, they delivered an impeccable set made from ravey electronica, increasingly hard techno, one surprising and very welcome “Groove Is in the Heart” remix and a trance-oriented finale.
