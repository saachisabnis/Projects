ScHoolboy Q has jokes for SiR after the latter became the latest TDE artist to have a show cancelled in Drake‘s hometown of Toronto.
On Tuesday (July 30), SiR took to X to let fans know that his scheduled stop at club History in the Canadian city would no longer be happening.

“So sorry to my Toronto fans. The show has been cancelled. We’re working on rescheduling for a later date,” he wrote. 
With a retweet, Q – whose Toronto show at the same venue was also cancelled at the last minute in June – wrote, “HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAA TAKE YO ASS HOME BOY.. SING ON THE BUS ITS OVA WIT.”

History in Toronto is a venue “brought to you by Live Nation, in collaboration with Drake,” so some are wondering if the OVO rapper may have blocked the TDE artists due to their affiliation with Kendrick Lamar.
ScHoolboy Q was initially fuming after his show was cancelled last month, and referenced the beef in his response.

At the time, he wrote on X: “THey just cancelled my sHow in TORONTO… CANADIAN POLICE DONT WANT NOBODY FROM TDE PERFORMING.”
He also appeared to threaten violence while referencing the bitter rivalry between Kendrick and Drake’s respective camps: “[I]f we wanted to get yall we would’ve just did it.. now wHen sumbody get Hurt don’t cry.”

In response, Drake seemingly trolled Q by posting a selfie of him wearing blue slides, an apparent reference to the West Coast rapper’s song of the same name.
He was also seen rocking a “Free Yayo” T-shirt, identical to the one that Eminem wore at the 2003 Grammy Awards while the G-Unit rapper was locked up.

The shirt appeared to be a nod to Tony Yayo’s recent comments that Drake’s enemies should watch out when traveling to Canada.
“You can’t really give your opinion because n-ggas still wanna go to Canada. You don’t wanna say something about Drake and now you can’t go to Canada,” Yayo told VladTV while discussing Drake’s beef with Kendrick. “You got wild n-ggas in Canada like Pressa, Bun and Top5, all these wild n-ggas.

“And then you gotta come on the West Coast — that’s the grandfather of fucking gangbanging. You know how fans get. It could be a fan that punch you in the head.”
