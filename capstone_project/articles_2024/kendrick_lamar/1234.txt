Yung Joc weighed in on the age-gap relationship between Aoki Simmons, Russell Simmons' 21-year-old daughter, and a 65-year-old entrepreneur. Discussing the matter with Shawn Prez, Joc shared his perspective on the generational differences within relationships. Kimora Lee, Aoki's mother, expressed her embarrassment upon seeing vacation pictures of her daughter with the much older man. Joc humorously emphasized the concerns a father would naturally have, especially regarding the motives of such an older partner. While addressing the complexities, Joc acknowledged that adult daughters make their own choices and highlighted the importance of guiding them rather than enforcing strict prohibitions, which could lead to resentment. Ultimately, Joc stressed respect and care within relationships but admitted discomfort with such a significant age difference, reflecting a common parental dilemma of letting young adults live their lives while wanting to protect them.
