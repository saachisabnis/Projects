While the track has gone viral thanks to the accompanying twerk craze, fans won’t be able to use the song on TikTok, because of Universal Music Group’s their dispute with the app.

The Memphis rapper took to Instagram Live to express her frustration at the battle, which resulted in the major label removing all of its artists’ music from the social app following a dispute over royalty payments.
She began: “One thing I’m mad about, y’all…I’m mad ‘cus I can’t use TikTok to promote my shit. I’m made y’all can’t make TikToks to my music, man…I’m mad about that.”
