Rick Ross’ private jet reportedly made a crash landing in Dallas on Friday and the “Hustlin'” rapper is blaming Drake for the ordeal amid their ongoing feud.
“My jet just crashed ; Drake OvO F16 fighter jet just shot us down 🔥🔥,” Ross, 48, wrote via X Friday.
The “Stay Schemin'” rapper then said via his Instagram Stories, “We on the jet and I’m seeing the fighter jet, I see its nose. It’s like Tom Cruise from ‘Top Gun'” before thanking everyone for the prayers.
“I seen its nose. I’m seeing him in the cockpit and I’m like, ‘damn.’ I see its cheeks going back from the G-force,” he further claimed. “And then it happened, I can’t say what happened, but it happened.”
Ross also continued taunting the “Rich Baby Daddy” rapper, adding “C’mon white boy.
“What I’mma take back about Drake’s old plane — BBL Drizzy, I know you got the ashtrays in the armrest and in hindsight, that’s really dope.”
Reps for the “Rick Forever” rapper, who was seemingly taking the alleged incident in jest, did not immediately return our requests for comment.
Page Six has been unable to confirm the plane crash, but a hip-hop outlet called Keep6ixSolid shared via X Friday photos from the alleged accident.
“Rick Ross’s jet makes a crash landing in Dallas,” the Toronto-based outlet tweeted, “He was just clowning Drake for his Boeing 767.”
Drake, 37, hasn’t publicly responded to Ross’ comments online — though he did like one post that discussed the incident. His reps did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.
It appears the Canadian rapper is preoccupied fending off another feud with Kendrick Lamar. On Friday night, Drake released a diss record about the “Swimming Pools” rapper titled, “Family Matters.”
His beef with Ross, though, came to a head in April, when Drake got into a battle of words with the “Diced Pineapples” artist for accusing him of getting a nose job.
At the time, Ross claimed in a track called “Champagne Moments” that the “Degrassi” alum underwent a rhinoplasty because he didn’t want to look like his father, Dennis Graham. 
The “Live Fast, Die Young” rapper also said at the time that he unfollowed Drake on Instagram after the “God’s Plan” hitmaker allegedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to French Montana.
It’s widely suspected that legal action was threatened because of Montana’s 2021 song “Splash Brothers,” which was allegedly meant to have both Drake and Ross as featured artists.  
Drake responded to Ross’ allegations with screenshots of a text conversation with his mother. 
“The internet is saying you got a nose job??” the Graham matriarch, 64, wrote. “You looked the same to me in the kitchen today. I can’t believe you would get one without me, 🤭 cuz you know I always wanted one. Don’t tell me that you got tattoos without me and now this, too? 🤔.”
Drake wrote back alongside several laughing emojis, “I would have got us a 2 for 1 deal if I went ma. It’s coming from Rick Ross.” 
The “One Dance” rapper then also claimed that Ross was taking the Type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro for weight loss, adding, “He’s gone loopy.”
