During the November 10th NFL game between the New York Giants and Carolina Panthers, it was announced that Lil Wayne will join NFL Gameday Morning as a sports analyst.
In September, it was announced that Kendrick Lamar would be the headlining artist for the halftime show of Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, Louisiana. Immediately following this announcement, controversy blew up online, with many upset that New Orleans's own Lil Wayne had not been picked for the show.
Just earlier this month Lil Wayne himself finally spoke up on the issue at his self-promoted festival, Weezyana Fest, "I worked my a** off to get that position and it was ripped away from me," he told the crowd.
Announced during a special NFL broadcast from Germany the NFL announced that Lil Wayne will be joining NFL Gameday Morning as a weekly guest and sports analyst throughout the rest of the 2024-2025 NFL season.
Some online have already started to speculate that Wayne's new position was a sort of consolation or apology from either Jay-Z or the NFL who both had a hand in picking the halftime show artist.
Lots of users on X lend their hand to the idea that Jay-Z pulled strings to get Wayne the spot, with endless replies on the original announcement all along the lines of "Thanks, Jay-Z."
