Super Bowl LIX will be hosted in New Orleans at the Caesars Superdome, and one native Louisiana start was snubbed from the halftime show.
When the Super Bowl was announced to be hosted from New Orleans lots of speculation and rumor began that Lil Wayne was likely to perform the halftime show as Wayne is an undeniable star from the city.
In September those rumors died out as Kendrick Lamar was announced to headline the halftime show. The decision to have Kendrick perform was made by the NFL, Apple Music, and Jay-Z's entertainment production company Roc Nation. Immediately after the announcement, there was instantaneous backlash from those who believed Wayne deserved the show.
After months of backlash, Lil Wayne has stayed mostly silent about the issue until this last weekend at Lil Weezyana Fest. During his concert, Wayne took a moment on stage to share a personal story about Super Bowl XLIV when he took his family to watch the Saints play. It was at that game Wayne told himself "I wanna be on stage at the Super Bowl one day in front of my mom."
"When the first Super Bowl was here I made sure I bought tickets at the beginning of the season. And you know, I did the same when I moved to Miami and I wishing my team made it and guess who made it that year, the m**** f****g Saints. I was able to give my momma that suite and she was able to bring my family and other people from New Orleans and they had a f****** ball." - Lil Wayne
Wayne went on to tell the crowd how he felt about not getting the spot at this season's Bowl. Wayne told the audience "I worked my a** off to get that position and it was ripped away from me," before telling the crowd at his own festival, "but this f***ing moment right here, they can't take that man."
