Kendrick Lamar has earned another rare achievement with his “euphoria” diss track.
ChartData reports that the song has officially sold 1 million units in the United States in just under a month. This marks Dot’s third release of 2024 to qualify for a platinum plaque alongside “Like That” and “Not Like Us” — with all three songs serving as diss tracks aimed at Drake.
“euphoria” arrived on the heels of Drizzy’s “Push Ups” and “Taylor Made Freestyle,” two diss tracks aimed at Dot. The cut featured production from Cardo and Kyuro with help from Johnny Juliano, Sounwave and Yung Exclusive, and hears a sample of Teddy Pendergrass’ “You’re My Latest, My Greatest Inspiration”.
