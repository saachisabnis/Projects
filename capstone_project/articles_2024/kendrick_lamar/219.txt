Top Dawg Entertainment is as present and impactful as ever. Isaiah Rashad and Ray Vaughn are on tour, ScHoolboy Q recently released his sixth album and SZA is making her way through festivals yet again. Now, Jay Rock is preparing to release his highly-anticipated LP, Eastside Johnny.
“[I’m going to] smile [through] it all. Real ones know what I’m capable of and been doing. Pay attention. [Eastside Johnny is] on [the] way,” he wrote.
Jay Rock released his last studio album, Redemption, on June 15, 2018. The 15-track project was littered with TDE representatives, including SZA and Kendrick Lamar. Future, Jeremih, Tee Grizzley, Mozzy and Dcmbr also appeared on the project. The album finished as one of the top 100 Billboard Hip-Hop and R&B projects of the year and the LP’s lead single, “Win,” earned a GRAMMY nomination for Best Rap Song.
Since Redemption hit streaming services, he has released a trio of singles — “Eastside” featuring Kal Banx, “Too Fast” featuring Anderson .Paak and Saweetie and “Blowfly” featuring Ab-Soul. He also appeared on Lil’ Wayne’s Funeral  and Problem’s Coffee & Kush, Vol. 2.
