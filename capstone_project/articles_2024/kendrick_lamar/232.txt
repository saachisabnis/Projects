Tyler, the Creator is set to star in his first-ever film with an all-star cast. According to a report Deadline published on Monday, September 16, the 33-year-old artist has been recruited to appear in Josh Safdie's upcoming movie, Marty Supreme. The A24 film's plot has not been revealed, however, it's reportedly based on the life of pro ping pong player Marty Reisman. Tyler will star alongside Timothée Chalamet, who's also a producer, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Funny enough, the news comes six years after Tyler rapped, “Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me" in his song "OKRA." 
This will be Tyler, the Creator's official film debut, but he's no stranger to Hollywood. During the peak of his time as the face of Odd Future, Tyler was the co-creator and star of the hit comedy series "Loiter Squad" on Adult Swim. He also helped launch TV series like "The Jellies!" and Viceland's "Nuts & Bolts." In addition, he had guest roles in animated series like "Regular Show" and "Big Mouth." Outside of film, Tyler had plenty of success with his music festival Camp Flog Gnaw since its inception in 2012. His festival went on hiatus from 2020 to 2022 due to the pandemic, but it made a major comeback last year with headliners like Kendrick Lamar, Baby Keem and SZA. The event will return to Dodger Stadium on November 16 and 17 for its 10th anniversary. The lineup hasn't been revealed yet, but the event is already sold out. Marty Supreme does not have a release date yet.
