ALLENTOWN — Major Keystone LLC introduced a new radio station — LOUD 103.7 — to Northeast Pennsylvania, including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, on Friday, according to a news release from Loud Radio PA.
The station will syndicate New York’s HOT 97’s Ebro in the Morning with Laura Stylez and Rosenberg, with live and local Pennsylvania talent from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., per the release.
LOUD 103.7 plays music from artists including Drake, Kendrick Lamar, SZA and Nicki Minaj, station officials said.
“Expanding the LOUD Radio brand into Northeast PA finalizes our regional footprint,” Founder Pat “Grooves” Cerullo said in the release. “In an area with unique and fast-changing demographics, this new signal allows us to better serve our listeners and advertising partners.”
