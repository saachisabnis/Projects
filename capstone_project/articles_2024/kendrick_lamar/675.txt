Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar, 37, will be performing at the 2025 Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime show on Feb. 9, 2025.
The announcement was made by the NFL, Apple Music, Roc Nation and Lamar himself — who posted a video announcement on his YouTube channel.
"My name's Kendrick Lamar and I'll be performing at Super Bowl LIX," the MC announces in the clip. "Will you be pulling up? I hope so. You know it's only one opportunity to win a championship. No round twos."
"I won't want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans. Feb. 9, 2025," Lamar adds. "Wear your best dress, too, even if you watch it from home."
The Super Bowl takes place in five months at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.
