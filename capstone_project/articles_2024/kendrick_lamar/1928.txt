50 Cent and Rick Ross have been sworn enemies for the longest time — so, naturally, the G-Unit head honcho couldn’t resist the opportunity to weigh in on the Biggest Bawse’s ongoing beef with Drake.
After Ross posted a video in which he referred to Drake as “BBL Drake” accompanied by a nose emoji — a reference to the Toronto rapper’s alleged plastic surgery on both his stomach and his nose — Fif weighed in on the drama in a now-deleted Instagram post made on Sunday (April 14).

He posted a photo of the text message exchange between Drake and his mother — which makes reference to the nose job insult lobbed by Ross — and wrote, “Mounjaro makes you hungry and racist [questioning face emoji] we don’t need this shit [angry face emoji] take it off the market! LOL.”

Drake has been in the hot seat over the past few weeks as a number of his A-list peers have taken shots at him, and a response that has been confirmed to be by him is now making the rounds online.
On Saturday (April 13), a bar-heavy joint hit the internet that addresses several of Drizzy’s ongoing beefs. This includes attacks on Kendrick Lamar in particular, who kickstarted the drama with his verse on Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That” last month.

In response, Rick Ross roasted Drake on the mic by recording a brand new diss track called “Champagne Moments” that aims everything from his flow to his nose.
DJ Akademiks premiered the diss track on his podcast on Saturday (April 13), with the Biggest Bawse teasing its drop on X, formerly known as Twitter, before unleashing it on the world.

“It’s the 1st qtr. This is going to be a good game. Grab a seat,” he wrote. “Perfect day to boss up.”
Ross then unleashed the full fury on the 6 God, accusing him of getting a nose job to appear less Black, spitting: “You ain’t never want to be a n-gga anyway, n-gga/ That’s why you had a operation to make your nose smaller than your father nose, n-gga.”

The track goes on to explain why the former collaborators fell out in the first place: “I unfollowed you, n-gga, ’cause you sent the motherfucking cease-and-desist to French Montana, n-gga/ You sent the police, n-gga, hatin’ on my dog project/ That wasn’t the same white boy that I seen, n-gga, when we were makin’ them early records, n-gga/ When you were happy to be around n-ggas, seein’ n-ggas holdin’ them sticks/ Yeah/ You owe motherfucking Stunna your life, n-gga.”
