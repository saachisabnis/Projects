Future has finally broken his silence on Drake and Kendrick Lamar‘s high-profile feud — and it appears there are a few things he’d been wanting to get off his chest.
In an interview with GQ alongside Metro Boomin, the Atlanta rapper initially played coy when asked about the feud, saying: “There was a beef? I didn’t even know there was a beef. I didn’t know they had nothing going on. I ain’t never participated in rap battles, man.”

However, the writer pointed out in the story (which is currently only available in print) that Pluto delivered his comments with an “impish smirk,” suggesting he was joking.
Taking on a more serious tone, the Freebandz boss then admitted that he’s still “confused” by the fallout from Kendrick’s “Muthafuck the Big Three, n-gga, it’s just Big Me” line on “Like That,” which prompted lyrical rebuttals from Drake and J. Cole (who are widely considered to be part of the so-called Big Three alongside Kendrick).

According to Future, he belongs in that Big Three conversation and had more of a right to be upset than anybody.
“I’m supposed to be the one who gets mad; I’m still confused about that,” he said. “Nobody cares what I think. That’s what was so fucked up about the shit. To the point where I’m so player that I ain’t even said anything about how I feel about it.

“Like, why is everybody mad when he was talking about me on my song? So y’all just forgot about me, I ain’t part of this Big Three, I’m nobody on my song, man,” he added with “faux self-depreciation,” according to the interviewer.
“If I didn’t get mad, nobody should have gotten mad! If I would have been really mad about it and I made something out of it, then someone else could be like, Oh, I can make something else about it.”

The “March Madness” hitmaker also clarified that he has no friction with any of the rappers involved in the wide-scale beef: “Who I’m not cool with? Because I ain’t got nothing to be mad about. Find something I should be mad at them about, then I guess I’ll get mad.”
He added: “Got no reason to be mad at nobody. I just told you, I’m chilling. Do I sound like I’m mad at anybody?”

Meanwhile, Metro Boomin confirmed that his falling-out with Drake was over “a personal issue” and not a woman, although he didn’t divulge what the issue was.
“Me and [Drake], we had a personal issue, and for the record, not over no girl or nothing silly like that. It was a personal issue that really hurt me and disappointed me,” he said.

“But if you take all the rap entertainment out of it, it’s like, have you ever been real cool with somebody, and y’all fell out over something? It happens every day. It’s just regular shit. This just happens to have an audience.”
The multi-platinum producer also admitted regret over his social media tirade against the 6 God following the release of his diss songs “Push Ups” and “Family Matters.”

In a series of X posts, Metro accused his former collaborator of spreading “lies,” called him a “colonizer” and claimed that he had tried to block radio from playing “Like That.”
“Now I did have my moment online, which I do regret,” he said. “I should have been stronger than that. That was out of character for me. But at a certain point, it’s like, I don’t rap, bro, so you’re going to just shit on me on all of these songs… I’m not going to get in the booth, so I’m finna tweet at you.”

The St. Louis native further rejected the notion that he and Future concocted a coordinated campaign against Drake on We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, both of which were littered with shots at the OVO hitmaker from various artists.
“People really think we sat for two years, making two albums [to be] like, Yo, fuck this dude. What kind of shit is that?” Metro asked rhetorically.

“You really think we are going to spend that much time, effort, resources on just trying to get at somebody on an album? Blowing budgets on two albums — going over budget? That’s some serious hate. Neither one of us rock like that.”
