Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar have always respected each other. Kendrick looked up to Wayne while growing up and tried to imitate him. In 2018, Wayne invited Kendrick to feature on his song "Mona Lisa." However, tensions flared when Kendrick was set to perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans, Wayne's hometown. Wayne expressed his frustration on social media multiple times. Recently, in an interview, he clarified that he and Kendrick are on good terms after a phone call. Wayne discussed the Halftime Show issue on The Skip Bayless Show, recognizing that Kendrick had no control over the situation. He made it clear he didn't blame Kendrick for how he felt. He said, "He didn't let me down, it ain't like he can control it." Wayne mentioned that he called Kendrick to resolve the matter, wishing him success with his performance. Kendrick referenced their tension in his new song "wacced out murals," noting, "Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud. Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down." When Skip Bayless asked if Wayne had talked with Kendrick about these lyrics, Wayne said no explanation was needed and admitted he hadn’t heard the lyrics until Bayless mentioned them.
In just a month, Lil Wayne's attitude has shifted. He expressed he was tired of the backlash regarding the Super Bowl situation. He cautioned not to confuse his kindness with weakness, warning that he could "destroy" anyone who disturbed him. It’s a relief to see the potential conflict between Wayne and Kendrick resolved peacefully, as no one wanted a repeat of the past issues involving Drake and Lamar.
