He also mentioned J. Cole was the "bigger man" for stepping away from Drake vs. Kendrick battle.

Wiz Khalifa is the latest rapper to weigh in on the Kendrick Lamar and Drake drama.

	While appearing on Shannon Sharpe’s YouTube interview series Club Shay Shay, the Pittsburgh rapper was asked about the rap battle that put the genre back at the center of the pop culture zeitgeist.

	“Bout time. I’m tired of n—as acting like they’re cool with each other,” he said about the beef. “Just speak how you really feel, bro.”

	He then was asked by the NFL Hall of Famer about the legal actions Drake took toward his and Lamar’s parent label UMG and wasn’t really surprised that the Toronto rapper chose to go down this road, saying, “Naw, it sounds like a Drake move to me.” Adding, “Well, he’s a musician and a businessman in my eyes. So, it’s like, if he’s not in the public eye winning musically, he’s going to get win wherever he can. I mean it’s a smart thing to do, in my opinion. They’re playing it exactly how they’re supposed to.”

	When the topic of the feud being orchestrated as a work — to borrow a term from pro wrestling — Wiz wasn’t a student of that theory. “No, I don’t think them n—as f—k with each other at all. I don’t think none of them n—as like each other,” he said. “It’s just how the industry is and all of that’s coming to an end now, and it’s all spilling out, and you got you’re getting to see it. But this is also like wrestling as well, so the same people who are arguing can be like cool instantly. So, it’s like, don’t get too caught up on the animosity part. Not them, but, in general, but people will be hugging later.”

	










	Elsewhere in the interview, J. Cole gracefully bowing out during Dreamville Fest also came up, he understood why fans reacted the way they did while also acknowledging Cole’s reluctance to move forward after releasing and deleting “7 Minute Drill“.

	“I think there’s two versions to it. In hip-hop, like, according to the rules of hip-hop, nah, hell nah. You’re not supposed to do that,” Khalifa said. “But in real life, you can take back some sh—t that you said. Like, ‘Oh, I said that? I probably shouldn’t have said that.'”

	Adding, “It takes a bigger man to be like, ‘I actually don’t want no problems.’ In real life, I f—k with it… I’ll let other people do the hip-hop thing.”
