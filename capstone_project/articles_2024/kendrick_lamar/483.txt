André 3000 has made a hilarious admission, noting that he doesn’t know what he’s doing regarding his pivot to the flute.
The OutKast legend stopped by LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s The Shop  on Friday (July 12), and reflected on his surprising career shift.

LeBron shared around the 5:05 mark that he went to one of André 3000’s first jazz shows in New York and came away impressed. He also noted that 3 Stacks had some on-stage banter, and that he was a “funny n-gga.”
André added: “I don’t want people to think that I’m trying to be a jazz musician. I kind of look at myself as a sonic displayist. I don’t know what notes I’m playing, to be completely honest. I’m not trying to pretend like I know what I’m doing, in a way. I actually don’t know what I’m doing and that’s part of the art.”
Dre was joined as a guest on The Shop by Sexyy Red and they bonded over a mutual appreciation of being doubted and criticized.
“They still don’t believe in me, so I just be like, ‘I’ma show you who I am,’” Sexyy Red said during the barbershop conversation, which also featured designer Jerry Lorenzo, BMX athlete Nigel Sylvester and comedian/actress Jiaoying Summers.

“They don’t understand we really came from nothing and then we be making big achievements. Like, that’s something for us. And then they just be like, ‘You ain’t doing nothing.’”
Sexyy’s remarks resonated with the OutKast legend as he interjected: “Fuel. Use it for fuel. Hater fuel, man, it’s the best shit. It’s free energy.”

The “SkeeYee” star concurred, adding: “Ummm hmmm. ‘Cause I’m now finna show you something.”
