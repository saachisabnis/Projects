Joe Budden expressed how upset he is over the rumored feud between Drake and Rick Ross. It stemmed from Ross unfollowing Drake on Instagram. The two rappers, with a history of friendship and collaborations, hit a rough patch after Ross featured on Future and Metro Boomin’s album, “We Don’t Trust You.”
Expressing how upset he is on his podcast, Budden lamented, “That Rick Ross unfollow hurt my soul and spirit. That one hurt.” He emphasized the impact of their potential rift, particularly on their collaborative music. Budden’s concern stems from the possibility of losing out on future collaborations between the two artists.
While the reason behind Ross’s Instagram action remains unclear, speculation among fans suggests a connection to a tweet from Metro Boomin urging people to “pick a side” after the album’s release. The album contains veiled shots at Drake, including a verse from Kendrick Lamar on the song “Like That.”

She received VIP treatment, fueling speculation.This move was perceived by some as a personal jab at Ross. In response, Ross posted a video of himself listening to Kendrick’s diss verse, hinting at a potential retaliation.
