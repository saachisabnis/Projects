Stephen A. Smith has a message for Drake.

	During his YouTube series The Stephen A. Smith Show, the sports media personality revealed that the Toronto rapper may be upset with him about previous comments he made about his battle with Kendrick Lamar and that Drake should answer “Not Like Us” with a song instead of answering with litigation.

	“I understand that Drake is a bit sensitive in these times. He’s in his feelings,” he said as he started his rant. “And don’t ask me how, but I know that he’s seen this show and I know that he’s seen some of things I have said about him on this show. I did not say or echo a negative thing about you. You’re a phenomenal artist, you’re big time.”

	Adding, “What I said was fact: ‘Not Like Us’ got you. I even pointed how the line about accusing you about being a pedophile — ain’t nobody paying attention to that. They just think it’s lyrics. It’s bars being dropped and he got the better of you. What I’m saying is, you don’t go the lawyer route in hip-hop over something like this. You take it to the studio. You take it to the streets. That’s all I said,” Smith continued. “I didn’t sit up there and say you can’t answer Kendrick Lamar. I said, ‘You better figure out a way to do so,’ meaning you have the capability, I think, to pull it off. That’s all!”
