Former UFC star, Nate Diaz has thrown his name into the hat for a series of blockbuster fights next — offering to take on world champion boxing star, Terence Crawford, as well as settling his rivalry with former two-weight UFC champion, Conor McGregor — both at 168lbs.
Diaz, a former undisputed lightweight title challenger under the banner of the UFC, departed the promotion back in 2022, most recently fighting out his contract in a fourth round guillotine choke submission win over former interim lightweight champion, Tony Ferguson. 
Making his sophomore outing in the ring earlier this year, Stockton favorite, Diaz would land a close majority decision win over two-time veteran, Jorge Masvidal over the course of 10 rounds in Anaheim back in the summer of this year.
However, linked with a slew of next moves in his return to combat sports, Nate Diaz — whose elder brother, Nick Diaz is slated to return in an end-of-year return at UFC 310 against Brazilian-American, Vicente Luque — has been speculated to make an Octagon return of his own.
And adding fuel to those rumors on social media today, Diaz, a victor of The Ultimate Fighter — staked his claim for a massive professional boxing match with world champion puncher, Crawford, before settling a trilogy rubber match with two-time opponent, McGregor.
“I box (Terence) Crawford and fight Conor (McGregor) next,” Nate Diaz posted on his official X account. “168 [pounds] LFG.”

Twice fighting former undisputed lightweight and featherweight gold holder during their tenures in the Octagon, Diaz handed McGregor his first organizational loss back in 2016 with a massive upset win, submitting the Dubliner with a second round rear-naked choke at the welterweight limit.
And later that year, the two would rekindle their rivalry in the main event of UFC 202, with McGregor avenging the loss with a close majority decision win over the Californian grappling veteran.
