Drake has appeared to respond to Kendrick Lamar‘s recent diss against him with a defiant speech during a performance.
During his second of two shows in Sunrise, Florida on his Big As the What? Tour on Sunday (March 24), Drizzy addressed the crowd and seemed to reference the shots that Kendrick took at him and J. Cole on Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That.”

Drizzy delivered a message of defiance to the audience, saying: “A lot of people ask me how I’m feeling… I’ma let you know I’m feeling. Listen, the same way I’m feeling is the same way I want you to walk out this building tonight.”
“I got my fucking head up high, my back straight, I’m 10 fucking toes down in Florida and anywhere else I go,” he added, his voice growing louder and more aggressive. “And I know that no matter what, there’s not a n-gga on this Earth that could ever fuck with me in my life!”
Appearing on Future and Metro’s recently released joint album We Don’t Trust You, Kendrick Lamar launched an attack on his two contemporaries with a scathing guest verse on the Three 6 Mafia-sampling “Like That.”
K. Dot started by referencing Drake and Cole’s number one single “First Person Shooter,” rapping: “Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches.”

He then dismissed the notion that the Toronto and North Carolina natives were his equals, spitting: “Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me.”
Kendrick also made reference to Drizzy’s album For All the Dogs: “N-gga, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary.”

The Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper also said: “And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack.”
J. Cole originally namedropped Kendrick on “First Person Shooter” while addressing the long-running “big three” debate: “Love when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K. Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali.”

Cole has yet to comment on Kendrick’s “Like That” verse but the two have a long history with it being rumored at one point that they were working on a joint album.
Addressing the long-awaited project last year, the Dreamville leader confirmed that they had concrete plans to record together but said their respective careers got in the way.

“At one point, it was a real thing,” he said on Lil Yachty‘s A Safe Place podcast. “But bro, time and life, we ain’t ever got the chance to go in and do it correctly because that would take time.
“For us to do something that’s full of our potential, that meets our real potential, you’re gonna need time. At least a year. When you got two successful artists with lives and families, that’s hard to do.”

He added: “We put it to bed years ago. But at one point in time, it was a real conversation, for sure … It’s not like it’s a ton of songs. It’s not like it’s some album sitting on the shelf somewhere.”
