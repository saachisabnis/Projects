Joe Budden has responded to Kanye West‘s perplexing shoutout during a Vultures 2 listening event in South Korea.
Footage emerged last week of Yeezy singing “Joe Budden” at the show, the media personality hopped on Instagram Live on Friday (August 23) and responded to the shoutout.

Budden responded by singing his own name and added: “Korean n-ggas was like, ‘What the fuck you talking about?'”
He added: “We here with peace and love.” He concluded by adding one more sung rendition of “Joe Budden” and added another line from Yeezy’s performance: “God’s not finished.”

It’s unclear why Kanye namedropped Budden, but Joe was particularly critical of Yeezy’s “Like That” remix.
Back in April, Ye dropped his remix to Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar‘s “Like That,” where he took shots at both Drizzy and J. Cole – much like K.Dot did on the original.

The track opened with West nodding to Drake’s beef with K.Dot by saying, “Yo Dot, I got you.” And the verse ended with direct shots at Drizzy and Cole: “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind/I can’t even think of a Drake line/ Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry.”
On an April episode of The Joe Budden Podcast, Joey called for Ye to remove himself from beef that is none of his business – particularly because, in Budden’s telling, Ye missed an earlier opportunity to beef with Drake.

“Kanye, sit your fucking ass down somewhere,” Joe began. “Mind your fucking business. This is not about you. This is some attention-seeking shit that you’re doing. Kanye has been trying to insert himself in this since the beginning. You had your shot. You didn’t take it. That n-gga was gunning for you. Y’all all ran except for Pusha… It’s not smooth when it’s not your beef.”
The podcast host did, however, admit that Ye’s tweaks to the “Like That” beat were top tier.

“I’ll tell you one thing – what he did to that beat? Woo!” Joe said. “Any time Kanye get around a choir, magic is coming.”
Though Joe Budden wasn’t a fan, Metro Boomin appeared to co-sign Kanye West’s diss after it dropped.

Taking to social media, the super producer posted a photo alongside Ye and captioned it, “Drake somewhere texting his mom they bullying me again.”
