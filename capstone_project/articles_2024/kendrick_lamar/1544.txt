Teezo Touchdown has reacted to Kendrick Lamar mentioning him on his chart-topping Drake diss “Not Like Us” earlier this summer.
On the track, K.dot references the nails Teezo often sports in his hair, rapping: “Nail a n-gga to the cross/He walk around like Teezo!”

Talking to Billboard in an interview published on  Thursday (September 5), the Texas native remained neutral and chose not to take sides – instead feeling honored that he’s even in a conversation with either artist.
“I made a decision that I wasn’t going to listen to any of the back-and-forth,” he revealed. “I’m seeing a mob mentality, and I don’t like division. Sorry I’m so kumbaya, but it’s all love over here. [The simple fact they both] know who I am… it’s still one of those moments where you have to pinch yourself. The kid in Beaumont, I’m pretty sure he’s jumping through the roof right now.”

Teezo Touchdown appeared on Drake’s 2023 effort For All The Dogs on “Amen,” and was later praised by the OVO rapper ahead of the release of his debut album, How Do You Sleep At Night?
Last summer, Drizzy shared a series of photos on his Instagram hyping up the genre-bending artist’s rookie project. In the post’s caption, he wrote: “Usually it’s a cut throat cryptic caption for the ones that turned on the gang members but tonight I just heard some of the best music ever so I am happy and I will spare you little birdies thanks to @teezotouchdown.”

Tyler, The Creator commented: “YAY,” while Lil Yachty added: “It’s your time brother.” Don Toliver also replied with a dynamite emoji. The Texas artist has worked with the aforementioned musicians in addition to being featured on Travis Scott’s UTOPIA.
As for “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar fans aren’t happy that Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help” has been crowned the song of the summer over the culture-dominating diss.

Billboard awarded the title to Posty’s country collaboration with Morgan Wallen on Wednesday (September 4) as they unveiled their Songs of the Summer chart for 2024.
As the publication explains, “the 20-position Songs of the Summer running tally tracks the most popular titles based on cumulative performance on the weekly streaming-, airplay- and sales-based Billboard Hot 100 chart from Memorial Day through Labor Day (this year encompassing charts dated June 8 through Sept. 7).”

“I Had Some Help” took home the crown after leading the chart for all 14 weeks throughout this time period.
“Not Like Us” came in at number three, behind Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — which currently sits at number one on the Hot 100 — in second place.

Despite being backed up by metrics, the results didn’t sit well with Kendrick Lamar fans who felt that “Not Like Us” was a shoe-in for Song of the Summer.
“‘Not Like Us’ and that 5 million it sold must have came out in a different summer that I’m not aware of,” one user wrote on X.

Another pointed out how inescapable K. Dot’s track was, commenting: “This exactly why n-ggas say stream farming exists cause WHO was listening to this the whole summer?? I couldn’t step foot outside without hearing ‘Not Like Us.’”
Even critics of “Not Like Us” took issue with the outcome, with one saying: “As a n-gga that hated ‘Not Like Us’ this some bullshit. They always try to drown black people out.”
