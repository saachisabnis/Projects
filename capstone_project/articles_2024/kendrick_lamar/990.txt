As Leeds Festival has come and gone, we’ve decided to take a look back at one of Cumbria’s best music festivals- Solfest.


  Music festivals in the UK hold a significant place in the country’s cultural fabric, serving as both a celebration of artistic expression and a reflection of societal values.


  Leeds Festival, one of the most iconic festivals in the UK, epitomises the grandeur of mainstream music culture.


  Held annually in Bramham Park, Leeds Festival is a key event in the UK’s live music calendar, attracting some of the biggest names in rock, indie, hip-hop, and electronic music.


  The festival’s history dates back to the 1960s, and it has evolved into a major platform for both established and emerging artists.


  It’s had some stellar headliners too, like Kendrick Lamar, Billy Eilish, Arctic Monkeys, and Foo Fighters in recent years.


  Leeds is one of the nation’s most prominent festivals, linked to Reading and surpassed by Glastonbury only.


  For many people, especially now, attending Leeds Festival could be seen as a sort of rite of passage, symbolising the energy and dynamism of British youth culture.


  In contrast, Solfest offers a more intimate, community-oriented experience.


  Held in the Wigton area, Solfest is known for its eclectic lineup, featuring a mix of folk, world music, electronic, and indie rock.


  Unlike larger, corporate-sponsored festivals, Solfest focuses on sustainability, local talent, and a family-friendly atmosphere.


  It fosters a sense of belonging and inclusivity, appealing to those who seek a more personal connection with music and fellow festivalgoers.


  Despite its smaller size, it’s still had a track record of attracting big names, such as De La Soul, The Wailers, and The Libertines.


  Together, festivals like Solfest and Leeds Festival highlight the diversity of the UK’s music scene, offering something for everyone, from mainstream chart-toppers to underground acts.


  These events are not just about music; they are about community, identity, and the shared experience of live performance.


  Next year we can likely look forward to one of the biggest and best lineups on the British festival calendar, with Liam and Noel Gallagher announcing the return of Oasis.


  In any event, supporting festivals in the county like Solfest and Kendal Calling means they can strive to get bigger names, and maybe welcome the duo next year as well.
