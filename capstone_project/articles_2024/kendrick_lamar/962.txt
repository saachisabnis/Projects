Happy Thursday, and happy Macy’s parade day! No matter where you are in the world and whether or not you celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you’re spending time with loved ones.
One thing I’m personally very thankful for is, well, you. Putting this column together is a highlight of my day. Having so many of you read it has changed my life in ways I can’t begin to describe.
I’ll never get tired of people telling me how much they enjoy it or (especially!) saying that they stop by after playing each day’s game themselves, just to see how I got on. And I definitely appreciate when anyone lets me know that I made an error. So, thank you.
I’m very happy we’re starting to build a small community around Connections and this column over on Discord. It’s always fun to find out how other people solved (or didn’t!) each grid. I’ll start including a link to the Discord here in the near future, but I’m intentionally keeping it small to begin with. If you’d like early access, shoot me an email!
Today’s NYT Connections hints and answers for Thursday, November 28, are coming right up.

Connections is a free, popular New York Times daily word game. You get a new puzzle at midnight every day. You can play on the NYT website or Games app.
You’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.
There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.
Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.
Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap.
If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it’s easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.
If you have an NYT All Access or Games subscription, you can access the publication’s Connections archive. This includes every previous game of Connections, so you can go back and play any of those that you have missed.
Aside from the first 60 games or so, you should be able to find my hints for each grid via Google if you need them! Just click here and add the date of the game for which you need clues or the answers to the search query.

I always enjoy when there's a timely theme to Connections (the emoji grid on April 1 remains a personal favorite). So I got a kick out of seeing THANKS and GIVING on the top row.
After a few tougher games (even though yesterday's should have been easier for me), I was very glad to have a straightforward grid today. The combo of THANKS and CREDIT made the yellows clear, as did CHEAT and CON for the greens.
There was really only one possible meaning for GOBBLE, but I figured that the other group would be the purples. Sure enough, I deduced that connection and completed that group first. That left the blues for a smooth win.
That’s all there is to it for today’s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog for hints and the solution for Friday’s game if you need them.
P.S. One of my favorite songs of the year is Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us." It feels apt to share it following this week's news about Drake accusing UMG (the record label for both artists) and Spotify of artificially inflating the popularity of the track. Just take the L, man. The song was a mega hit.
“Not Like Us” is an utter demolition of Drake that, following some back and forth, decisively crowned Lamar as the winner of a feud between the pair. I've never heard a catchier diss track nor a more stunningly efficient ethering (even though I needed to look up the meaning of some lyrics) of someone. For the sake of keeping things somewhat family friendly, I've included a clean version of the track below, but the unrestricted music video is on YouTube for your enjoyment:
