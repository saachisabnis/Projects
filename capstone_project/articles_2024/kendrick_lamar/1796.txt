As the 50th year of hip-hop comes to a close, the AFRO salutes the pioneers of hip-hop and those who have sustained the genre for 50 years and those who carry it into the future. Started on Aug. 11, 1973 by DJ Cool Herc at a birthday party in the Bronx, New York, the story of hip-hop is the story of a people who have risen from the grittiest of environments to reclaim their self respect, dignity and culture. As we close out the 50th year of hip-hop, we reflect on how it has changed over the years and where it is headed in the future.
In the vibrant world of music and cultural expression, few genres have had as profound an impact as hip-hop. Originating in the Bronx, N.Y. in August 1973, this revolutionary movement marked its 50th anniversary in 2023, reflecting not just the evolution of a musical genre but an entire culture and way of life.

The AFRO had the privilege of interviewing iconic DJs who have played pivotal roles in shaping the local scene, including DJ Tanz, DJ Mike Crosby, DJ Sean Marshall and the legendary DJ Kool.
Initially dismissed as a fleeting trend, hip-hop has proven its longevity and transformative power. Beyond a mere musical genre, it is a culture, a movement and a lifestyle. From its humble beginnings with pioneers like Grandmaster Flash and The Sugar Hill Gang to the present-day dominance of artists like Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar, hip-hop has consistently evolved while maintaining its authenticity.
Transcending boundaries: More than just music
What sets hip-hop apart is its ability to transcend boundaries of race, gender and socioeconomic status. It serves as a powerful platform for marginalized voices to be heard, addressing issues ranging from social justice to economic inequality. As it expanded, hip-hop became a global force, influencing cultures far beyond its birthplace and connecting people through a shared love for its artistry.
When asked about the influence of hip-hop on their careers, each DJ provided a unique perspective.
DJ Tanz has been reflecting on his journey all year.  
“Hip-hop is life for me. It’s a part of everything that I do. I have taken the entire trip,” said DJ Tanz. “From Rapper’s Delight to Lil Yachty. The stories I could tell! Thank you, hip-hop!
DJ Mike Crosby spoke with the AFRO about how hip-hop has changed his life. 
“I was influenced by hip-hop because it was something I could relate to. The beats, the lyrics were incredible to me. My favorite rap group was Run DMC. I would go to the concert and just stare and wish that would be me one day.”
Another entertainer, DJ Sean Marshall, shared his inspirations, citing DJ Cut Creator as a key influence. 
“I wanted to be recognized and known for my talents like DJ Cut Creator,” said Marshall. “I’ve had an amazing DJ career thus far. Music and being a DJ can save your life like it has for so many inner-city young adults if you stick with it. Never give up.”
As for DJ Kool, a true pioneer in the industry, he spoke about witnessing the changes in hip-hop over his 47-year career. While acknowledging the positive impact of early risers like Public Enemy and KRS-One, he expressed concern about the current trend of glorifying the drug culture and violence. 
“Responsible storytelling is crucial, with artists having a duty to guide the youth away from destructive paths,” said DJ Kool.
As hip-hop celebrates its 50th anniversary, it’s essential to consider its future. The genre has demonstrated remarkable resilience, adapting to societal changes and remaining a powerful force for self-expression and cultural commentary. However, challenges lie ahead, particularly in navigating the balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility.
The next 50 years of hip-hop will likely see continued evolution, with new voices emerging to shape the narrative. DJs will play a crucial role in curating the sounds that define the culture. As the torchbearers of this dynamic movement, they hold the responsibility of preserving its essence while guiding it toward positive and impactful expressions.
Hip-hop’s 50-year journey is a testament to its enduring influence. From the streets of the Bronx to stages worldwide, it has become a global phenomenon that transcends generations. As long as it continues to adapt and address the pressing issues of our time, hip-hop is poised to remain a cultural powerhouse for decades to come as it continues to influence our future DJs, who’ll have their records to spin and stories to tell. 
132 years ago we were covering Post-Reconstruction when a former enslaved veteran started the AFRO with $200 from his land-owning wife. In 2022 we endorsed Maryland’s first Black Governor, Wes Moore. And now we celebrate the first Black Senator from Maryland, Angela Alsobrooks!

The AFRO knows what it’s like to endure challenging times. John H. Murphy, Sr., a former enslaved man founded the AFRO in 1892 with $200 from his wife, Martha Howard Murphy. Together they created a platform to offer images and stories of hope to advance their community. The AFRO provides readers with good news about the Black community not otherwise found.
