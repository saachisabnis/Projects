The Game says he's working on the next installment of The Documentary ahead of his debut album's upcoming 20th anniversary. On Saturday, August 3, the Los Angeles rapper, born Jayceon Taylor, revealed his plan during an episode of the Tacos & Shawarma podcast. During their conversation, Game said he aims to release the project on the same day as the first album — which arrived on January 18, 2005. “I’m definitely gonna start the new album and I ain’t told anybody that," he said. "But yeah, The Documentary 3. I’m gonna go in hard and I’ma drop it the same day that the other one dropped... I’m up for the challenge. It’s gonna be tough.”
The Game discussed the idea while speaking on his upcoming plans with photographer Jonathan Mannion, who has shot album covers for the likes of DMX and JAY-Z. He teased an upcoming collaboration with Mannion to honor the 20th anniversary of his first album from Dr. Dre's Aftermath and 50 Cent's G-Unit Records. Game's 11th studio album would technically be the fourth installment of his Documentary series. Following the first LP in 2005, the 44-year-old released The Documentary 2 in 2015 featuring Drake, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and more. He followed up a week later with the second half of the LP The Documentary 2.5 featuring Nas, Lil Wayne, Scarface and others.It's been an active year for The Game. The Los Angeles native has delivered two projects over the past few months including his recent LP Time with Woodboy Gee and Paisley Dreams with Big Hit. They both arrived two years after his explosive 2022 LP DRILLMATIC: Heart vs. Mind.  Look out for The Documentary 3 coming January 2025.
