Eminem made fellow rapper Latto blush and dissolve into giggles when he paid her a high compliment recently.
The Detroit-born Slimy Shady lauded Latto for her auspicious career on Netflix’s “Rhythm + Flow” Season 2.
“I love you, by the way. You’re f—ing incredible,” he told Latto on the show. Latto smiled widely before thanking him for the compliment. Fans loved how a legendary lyricist encouraged a rising superstar in the game.
#Latto and #Eminem shared a heartwarming moment during the latter’s guest appearance on Netflix’s Rhythm + Flow Season 2. 🥰 The hip-hop veteran gave the Georgia peach her rap game flowers, stating: “I love you by the way.

Getting the stamp of approval from a vet like Eminem was likely a full-circle moment for Latto, as the rising rap star got her own start in music by appearing on the rap competition series, The Rap Game, back in 2016.
