They both know how to get the party started.
Two zodiac signs that know how to have a good time: Leo and Gemini. As an air sign, Gemini has the initial spark and inspiration to get the party started, and as a fire sign, Leo has the stamina and energy to keep the party going. Gemini’s air feeds Leo’s fire, and their flame burns so bright!!! This duo doesn’t mind spending their time socializing and trying new things—in fact, they prefer it. Gemini will push Leo out of their comfort zone, and Leo will be Gemini’s personal cheerleader for any idea that crosses their mind. Whatever they do together, this pair is destined to have a good time.

These two zodiac signs share a few important traits in common. Both are extremely social and likely have a wide-ranging circle of friends. They both also tend to be creative and playful—they always have fun together! However, Gemini tends to lead with their heads, while Leo leads with their hearts. And Gemini prefers to be more spontaneous, while Leo likes to have some stability.
Friendship comes naturally between Leo and Gemini. Both are curious and extroverted by nature, and they’re eager to spend time together soaking up new life experiences. This zodiac combination knows how to build the other up and support one another’s dreams. Leo might be a little more rigid when it comes to making plans, and Gemini’s desire to fly by the seat of their pants can irk Leo from time to time. If Leo can learn to not take Gemini canceling plans last minute so personally, this duo makes BFF material. Gemini has an inquisitive nature and loves to ask questions, and Leo loves to talk about themselves. Cha-ching!
Sex between a Leo and a Gemini is an Oscar-worthy interaction. Leo loves to perform between the sheets and they're always open to trying new things. Gemini craves versatility and will appreciate Leo’s desire to up the ante every time they hop in bed. Leo is also a natural initiator and leader, while Gemini tends to be more go with the flow. Leo won’t be shy when it comes to making the first move, which is good, because Gemini’s social nature can sometimes leave them lingering in the friend zone longer than they anticipated. These two like to have fun when making love, and surprises are always welcome. As long as Gemini throws in a compliment or two and strokes Leo’s ego, this sexual chemistry lands off the charts!
In a relationship, Leo and Gemini operate effortlessly as a duo on a day-to-day basis. The only major obstacle that this pair has to face is jealousy. Leo can be incredibly independent, but they are also known to have bouts of possessiveness. Gemini is a free spirit that craves the type of independence that lets them go silent for a day or a three, and then return with stories to share. Leo will have to learn to not take Gemini’s desire to do their own thing personally, or get jealous if Gemini wants to spend time socializing with other people. If Gemini is able to communicate their unwavering love for Leo and reassure them that they hold a special place in their heart, this won’t be an issue. In the beginning stages of the relationship, Gemini’s flighty and aloof nature can leave Leo wondering if they’re really royalty in Gemini’s life, but with communication, this will get easier over time.
At their core, Leo and Gemini both crave fun. These zodiac signs thrive off of tapping into their inner child. A marriage or long-term, committed relationship between Leo and Gemini can feel refreshing for both parties because they each encourage the other to cultivate more play in their lives. Leo craves stability as a fixed sign in the zodiac, while Gemini is a mutable sign that can easily get bored with the status quo. The challenge in this partnership over time is to make sure there is a balance between Leo's desire for dependability and Gemini's drive to change up the routine. As long as this pair commits to honoring one another’s needs, this is one of the most exciting pair of partners in the zodiac! 
These two both tend to be over-sharers, so the main concern is that they'll talk over each other! While they're both able to communicate their feelings and thoughts clearly, they both need to learn to take time to really listen when the other person is speaking, rather than simply waiting for their turn to talk.
Gemini does *not* have a reputation for being the most trustworthy, and unfortunately, this does trend to be true. Even if they're not intentionally setting out to lie, they have a somewhat ~fluid~ perception of reality and they've got the verbal skills to talk around anything they're trying to hide. Leo, on the other hand, wants their partner to be honest with them and values stability. To make a relationship work, Gem will have to be a bit more open than they might like and Leo will have to learn how to ask the right questions to find out what they want to know.
Gemini and Leo are a pair that clicks like *that*. The main risk here is that their relationship will be for short-term fun rather than long-term stability. When air and fire meet, they form a flame. But will that flame burn out brightly and quickly, or will it burn steadily for many years? It's all up to whether the Leo and Gemini in question are willing to put in the work.
These two get along like a house on fire! Both are incredibly playful, creative, and outgoing. If they're interested in a serious, long-term relationship, they'll need to learn to really hear each other out, and find a compromise on some of their differences—like Gemini's spontaneity vs. Leo's need for stability. All in all though, these two are a great pair.
Still together:
