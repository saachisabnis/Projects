It’s no secret that Drake is a massive cornball. The Canadian rapper, whose debut album “Thank Me Later” was released in 2010, has changed the way hip hop has affected the masses. Sadly, it’s not in a good way. Kendrick Lamar’s new Drake diss song, “euphoria,” called out the way the “For All The Dogs” artist has made a mockery of Black American culture—and  we have the proof.
Here’s a list of the corniest sh*t Drizzy has ever done.
Drake really thought he was onto something when he employed AI to emulate of voices of the late Tupac Shakur and the very much alive Snoop Dogg on “Taylor Made Freestyle.” The track, which he deleted after Tupac estate’s threatened Drake with legal action, took aim at Kendrick Lamar and begged him to respond to the 4 minute debacle. Drizzy also insisted Taylor Swift was the reason Kendrick was taking his time, reminding us that he deserved every insult in “euphoria.”
On his 2022 track “Circo Loco” alongside 21 Savage, Drake referened Tory Lanez shooting Megan Thee Stallion back in 2020 by rapping: “This b*tch lie about getting shots, but she still a stallion / She don’t even get the joke but she still smiling.” There’s nothing funny about violence against Black women, but Meg said it best when she commented: “Stop using my shooting for clout b*tch a** n***a!”
Last year, Drake released his song “Slime You Out” featuring SZA which would appear on his most recent album “For All The Dogs.” In addition to using Halle Berry on the track’s cover art against her wishes, Drake also joked about slavery in the song. “Whipped and chained you like American slaves/Act like you not used to Sheraton stays.” There’s no justification for these egregious lines, but clearly the bar is in hell for Drake.
In his lethal 2018 diss track “The Story of Adidon,” Pusha T not only read Drake for his entire life but used a shocking 2007 photo of the Canadian emcee in blackface as the song’s cover art. Drizzy attempted to explain the image on his Instagram Story.  “I was working on a project that was about young Black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment.” All we have to say is: blackface is never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever justifiable.
Last year, Drake purchased a ring designed by the late Tupac Shakur for just over a $1 million (its presale estimate was valued between $200,000-$300,000). He debuted the ring on his Instagram and wore it in interviews. If this isn’t one of the biggest examples of Drake’s culture vulture cosplay, we don’t know what is.
On Pusha T’s 2018 scorched earth Drake diss track,  “The Story Of Adidon,” he alerted the world that Drake had a secret child. He had privately fathered a son named Adonis with former adult film actress  Sophie Brussaux. The revelation that Drake was a deadbeat father forced the emcee to start showing his child more — but it was sad that it came to that.
When Morgan Wallen was caught saying racial slurs on camera in 2021, he publicly apologized and had his music pulled from radio stations and Country Music Television. Of course, that didn’t stop him for staging a comeback, headlining tours and becoming one of the most streamed artists in 2023. For reasons no one will ever understand, Drake featured Wallen in his “You Broke My Heart” video last year. 
While on tour earlier this year, Drake showed just how petty he can be. During a show in Tampa, Fla. he refused to perform his hit song with his ex Rihanna entitled “Work” — even though he played a clip of it onstage. As it played, Drake remarked: “I don’t sing this song anymore. You can sing it for me.” This is peak cornball behavior.
On his joint 2022 project with 21 Savage entitled “Her Loss,” Drake couldn’t help from bringing up his ex Serena Williams on the track “Middle of The Ocean.” He rapped: “Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie/He claim we don’t got a problem but/No, boo, it is like you comin’ for sushi.” Williams’ husband, Alexis Ohanian, fired back at the rapper.
“The reason I stay winning is because I’m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter,” he wrote on X/Twitter.
Though Drake loves posting shirtless photos on his social media, fans have speculated for a while that he’s had plastic surgery. Rick Ross has stated Drake got a BBL, Megan Thee Stallion has alluded to certain rappers having scars from getting work done and even Kendrick implored Drizzy to share where he got his abs from.
Over the last year, Drake has appeared in two Sexyy Red videos: “Rich Baby Daddy” and “Get It Sexyy.” He has pathetically embraced the role of being a video vixen and on “euphoria” Kendrick addressed this trend: “When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad b**ches/I believe you don’t like women/It’s real competition/You might pop a** with ‘em. 
For years, Drake has done his best to imitate Jamaican accents. Some call it a fake patois, but ultimately it’s just disrespectful. Fans heard him do his infamous impression on songs like Popcaan’s “We Caa Done” and his “On The Radar” freestyle with Central Cee.
In 2023, Drake tied Michael Jackson for the most number one singles in Billboard chart history. He celebrated the milestone on Instagram as well on his song “First Person Shooter” with J.Cole. Drake rapped: “N***as talkin’ ‘bout when this gon’ be repeated/What the f**k, bro? I’m one away from Michael/N***a, beat it.”
 In the video for the track, Drake dressed like the late music icon and attempted to do a Michael Jackson dance. Drizzy just needs to have several seats — forever.
