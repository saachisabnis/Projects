"Gonna make sure the block gets lifted," the rapper assured a fan on Instagram
Tyler, The Creator has revealed that he’s trying to get copyright strikes lifted so that fans can react to his new album in full on social media.
Following the release of his latest album ‘Chropmakopia’ in late October, fans of Tyler, The Creator have been sharing their reactions to the record on social media. However, many of said fans have begun experiencing copyright strikes and blocked for their content, with either the sound being removed from their videos, or the videos and accounts being taken down completely.
Now, the rapper has assured a fan on Instagram that his team are working on getting the copyright strikes lifted so that complete reactions can be shared on social media without penalty. In response to one fan flagging copyright bans, Tyler commented, per SleepingOnGems: “Gonna make sure the block gets lifted man, hit my squad up early this am”.
The fan later responded saying: “Video is up and all blocks lifted. Appreciate you helping”.

Earlier this year, in the midst of their heated feud, both Kendrick Lamar and Drake had waived all copyright stipulations from their diss tracks targeted at each other, resulting in the mass reacting and sharing of their songs on social media.
In May 2023, Grimes criticised the use of copyright in regards to music: “Copyright sucks. Art is a conversation with everyone that’s come before us. Intertwining it with the ego is a modern concept. The music industry has been defined by lawyers, and that strangles creativity.
“I think everything about copyright is problematic,” Grimes added. “There’s too much top down control. In the early days of TikTok there was a lot of weird music going viral, but now the gatekeeping stranglehold means less interesting stuff coming out.”

In the wake of the ‘Chromakopia’ release, Tyler has announced more dates for his massive ‘Chromakopia’ world arena tour. He’s added three shows in his hometown of Los Angeles, along with New York, Austin, and Seattle, while adding on to his European leg with another Paris date. Australia has also received three new shows on the tour.
In NME’s three-star review of ‘Chromakopia’, Fred Garratt-Stanley wrote: “Within the chaos [of the album], there’s beauty — the sensitivity of ‘Hey Jane’, the infectious hip-hop bite of ‘Thought I Was Dead’, the rising cacophonies of brass and percussion on ‘I Killed You’. But perhaps a less frantic approach would’ve benefited the listen overall.”
