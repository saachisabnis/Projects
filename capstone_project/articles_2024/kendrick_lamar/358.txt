Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) — The April 8 total solar eclipse will be a once-in-a lifetime event, and so too will be the RPO’s Eclipse Spectacular.
"This is going to be the biggest event in the 100 years of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra,” said Jeff Tyzik, the group's principal pops conductor.
The historic show will bring RPO's music director, pops conductor and assistant conductor together in the same program for the first time ever.
The orchestra won't be alone as it marks the spectacle in the sky. A community gospel choir has been created to collaborate with RPO for the event.
“We gathered a choir of the community's best singers to participate in this special performance,” said choir coordinator Renee Anderson.
"The sound, the lights, the dancers, cirque artists flying over the orchestra, gospel choirs, the RPO and PUSH Physical Theatre, Madrigalia and Rochester City Ballet," Tyzik said. "Everybody is coming together to create this magical event in honor of our eclipse weekend."
The orchestra will deliver an "out-of-this-world" performance to match the theme of the big event.
"(We'll be) playing phenomenal music from Star Wars, Star Trek, The Planets by Holst and an original piece by me," Tyzik explained. "It's going to be a really fantastic evening."
"Imagine what it would be like if you went to an orchestra concert that had the energy or hype that a Kendrick Lamar or Drake concert would have,"said Jherrard Hardeman, RPO's assistant conductor. "This is an orchestra concert with the bells and whistles of any rock show."
The concert is Sunday, April 7 at 7 p.m. at the Blue Cross Arena.Click here for ticket information.
