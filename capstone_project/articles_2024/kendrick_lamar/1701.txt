50 Cent believes Drake had enough material to continue his beef with Kendrick Lamar. During an interview Big Boy's Neighborhood released on Monday, December 9, Fif weighed in with his thoughts about the ongoing feud between Drizzy and K-Dot. As someone who engaged in several beefs throughout his career, 50 Cent knew that the glorified battle between the Canadian MC and the West Coast phenom would be "competitive." "I felt like they would be competitive," he began. "It was a good period for Hip-Hop in general because they produced material faster. It forced them to work."
"It felt like Kendrick wasn't responding fast then when [Drake] came again and it was another joint, I was like 'Damn okay,'" he continued. "And then Kendrick came with a whole CD." Later in the conversation, Big Boy asked 50 Cent about the advice he gave Drake when they connected earlier this year. Fif said he brought up his beef with Pusha T and asked him, "What did you really lose?" Drizzy replied, "Nothing," which helped make 50's point that he didn't actually lose in either situation. He also shared that Drake actually had more heat in the chamber ready to fire at Kendrick, which could've fueled their beef even more. "They was loaded again," Fif said. "Drake was loaded and ready to go again. I know that they had new material ready to go again. There's no way you stop when you losing. Nah I gotta fix it." Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef blew up earlier this year after Kendrick Lamar dissed him on Future & Metro Boomin's "Like That." The song sparked a lyrical melee between both artists resulting in songs like Drake's "Family Matters" and Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us." After they sonic war subsided over the summer, Kendrick reignited their issues on his new album GNX in which he shades Drizzy and Lil Wayne on the intro "wacced out murals." There are plenty more gems where that came from. Watch Big Boy's entire interview with 50 Cent below.
