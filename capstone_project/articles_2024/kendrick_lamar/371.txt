The beef of Kendrick Lamar and Drake will be the focus of Channel 4, Acme Films and GroupM Motion Entertainment’s upcoming Public Enemies documentary.
Deadline reports that Kendrick vs. Drake will “explore how and why” Dot and Drizzy rose to universal acclaim while “contextualizing their careers through the contemporary history and culture which created them.” The docu will utilize archive and interviews with figures who have worked alongside the two artists as they dissect their conquest of the music industry.
“Public Enemies: Kendrick vs Drake is not just a biography; it’s a cultural exploration of two of the most influential voices in modern music. This documentary will delve into the unique journeys of Kendrick and Drake, examining how their backgrounds, talents, and visions have made them global icons,” said Shaminder Nahal, Head of Specialist Factual for Channel 4. Acme Creative Director Jaimie D’Cruz added, “It’s only a few years since our previous Public Enemies film for Channel 4 explored the rivalry between Jay Z vs Kanye, but Public Enemies: Kendrick vs Drake feels like a story that takes place in a time when all the rules have changed, and beef is all around us.”
The pair’s beef boiled over into the mainstream earlier this year with the release of diss tracks such as “The Heart Part 6” and “Not Like Us,” all of which included some pretty heinous accusations against the other.
Stay tuned for an official premiere date.
