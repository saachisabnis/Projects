Rising hip-hop artist Flau’jae released her latest single “Big Bag” Nov. 3, delivering a high-energy track that blends ambition with authenticity.
The song showcases her signature style: rapid-fire verses layered over dynamic beats, with lyrics focusing on success, perseverance and self-empowerment. “Big Bag” marks her first release since signing with Columbia Records earlier this year.
The 19-year-old’s path to success carries deep musical roots. Her father, Camouflage, was a rising Savannah rapper who was fatally shot in 2003 before Flau’jae was born. She began rapping at age seven, driven to continue his legacy while creating her own lane in hip-hop.
Her breakthrough came at age 14 on “America’s Got Talent,” where she reached the quarterfinals with original compositions addressing gun violence and social justice. The exposure led to appearances on “The Rap Game” and “AGT: Champions,” establishing her as more than a traditional reality show contestant.
Now a junior guard for Louisiana State University’s women’s basketball team, Flau’jae balances NCAA athletics with her music career. She contributed to LSU’s 2023 national championship run while maintaining a recording schedule, demonstrating unusual versatility for a young artist.
Industry observers note her timing aligns with a broader shift in hip-hop, as more young women artists claim space in the traditionally male-dominated genre. Recent breakthroughs by artists like Ice Spice, GloRilla and Lola Brooke have created momentum for emerging voices.
The new single emphasizes themes resonating with young listeners:
– Financial independence
– Overcoming obstacles
– Maintaining authenticity
– Building generational wealth
– Educational excellence
Music industry analyst Mark Richardson of Billboard notes the strategic timing of the release. “November traditionally sees heavy competition for attention in hip-hop, with major artists dropping holiday releases. Flau’jae’s choice to release now shows confidence in her growing audience.”
The track’s production credits include Grammy-nominated producer Mike Will Made-It, known for his work with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar. This collaboration signals Flau’jae’s rising status within the industry.
Her musical style draws from both old school and contemporary hip-hop, with influences ranging from Tupac Shakur to J. Cole. Previous releases like “Can’t Beat Us” and “I Can’t Break” have accumulated millions of streams across platforms, establishing her as a voice for young athletes and artists pursuing dual passions.
Early streaming numbers indicate strong support from her core audience, with “Big Bag” reaching the Spotify Viral 50 chart within 24 hours of release. The song’s initial reception suggests potential for crossover appeal beyond her established fan base.
Columbia Records plans to support the release with a digital marketing campaign targeting college campuses and social media platforms where Flau’jae maintains an active presence.
