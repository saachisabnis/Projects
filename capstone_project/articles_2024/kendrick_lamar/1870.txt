The latest in a glut of free San Francisco outdoor concerts will feature R&B bass wizard Thundercat and soul artist Lee Fields in an outdoor concert at Robin Williams Meadow on Sunday, October 20. 
It‚Äôs hard to keep track of all of the free outdoor concert series being put on in San Francisco these days. Friday night brings us that free Portugal.The Man show at Civic Center Plaza, put on by Another Planet Entertainment, who also gave us that free Embarcadero show from the Dirtybird crew in late July. There‚Äôs also the SF Live concert series, co-organized by Noise Pop, which included this month‚Äôs Eagles of Death Metal show near Potrero Hill, and a just-announced Halloween weekend concert at Jerry Garcia Amphitheatre.

Today we get another new announcement from the Summer of Music series, which is also co-organized by Noise Pop plus the Civic Joy Fund. And the Chronicle reports Summer of Music just announced that R&B bass player Thundercat will perform a free show on Sunday, October 20 ¬†in Golden Gate Park‚Äôs Robin Williams Meadow. The show will also feature the prolific soul singer Lee Fields and the local psychedelic cumbia band Combo Tezeta. ¬†
Tickets are free, but RSVP is required. 
Thundercat started as a replacement bassist for the legacy punk band Suicidal Tendencies, which is an unusual start fro someone who would go on to collaborate with Erykah Badu and Gorillaz. Thundercat would win a Grammy for his work on Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs ‚ÄúThese Walls‚Äù (seen above), and another Grammy in 2020 for Best Progressive R&B Album with his solo album It Is What It Is. ¬†
The Summer of Music series has not been grabbing as many headlines for their free concerts as the other concert series we mentioned. Most of their shows have been more like ‚Äúpub crawl‚Äù concerts with six or more smaller local acts playing in front of a certain chosen neighborhood‚Äôs various bars, restaurants, or retail stores. This concert is their first foray this year into the big outdoor concert-in-a-park formula.
And speaking of free concerts, we should remind you that Flower Piano is currently underway in Golden Gate Park, and continues through Sunday. If you‚Äôre keen to head out, there‚Äôs a sortable schedule by date here. ¬† ¬†
