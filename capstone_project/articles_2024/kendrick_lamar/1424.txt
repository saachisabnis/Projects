	There’s been a bunch of Lil Baby headlines on Thursday (Dec. 19) as he rolls out his upcoming album WHAM: Who Hard As Me.

	He recently sat down with Charlamagne Tha God, where he talked about his relationship with Gunna and getting name-dropped in Kendrick Lamar‘s Drake diss track “Not Like Us,” in which the Compton MC rapped, “You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance/ Let me break it down for you, this the real n—a challenge/ You called Future when you didn’t see the club/ Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up.”

	Charlamagne broached the subject by asking the Atlanta rapper about being mentioned on the track that effectively ended the battle. “I ain’t really into that side of hip-hop,” Baby admitted in reference to the genre’s ritual of battling it out on wax for the game’s top spot. He then said he and Drake have “a great relationship” before adding, “It’s just like with any situation: If you and him was arguing, why the hell you gonna say [my name]?”

	He continued by saying he treats rap like work. “I don’t want nothing to do with it,” he said. “Not saying whatever they got going on ain’t real, but I feel like, to me, rappin’ and sh– be my work. I don’t want that type of sh– at work.”
