Kendrick Lamar‘s alleged diss response to Drake and J. Cole has been confirmed as a fake after a man revealed he used artificial intelligence to make it.
An up-and-coming artist by the name of Sy The Rapper revealed on Tuesday (April 16) that he was the person behind the fake track and explained how he made it.

In a video posted on Instagram, Sy talked viewers through the creation process, revealing how he created the beat and rapped lyrics in the style of Kendrick before putting the recording through an AI program.
He added that he was surprised by how authentic the song sounded: “I ain’t gonna lie, I psyched myself. I thought it was gonna sound fake, I thought people was gonna be able to tell it was fake. People think it’s actually real.”

He also said: “I just wanna come out for the record and say that it’s AI. That’s not Kendrick’s response. I know Kendrick’s gonna come harder than that. I just couldn’t get too disrespectful ’cause I ain’t in that beef.”
Watch the clip below.
The song, titled “One Shot,” appeared online earlier this week and was immediately greeted with skepticism by most fans who thought it was fake.
The track featured lyrics such as: “I dominated your favorite rapper you idolize/ My silence is enough to make n-ggas apologize” and “Now that it’s direct, it’s leaked disses from burner pages and all/ Insecure behavior from n-ggas y’all call Gods.”

Producer DJ Dahi, who has worked with Kendrick extensively over the years, was among those who cast doubt on its authenticity.
“Man we live in a weird time, AI diss tracks!! we need Google authentications to make sure all this shit is real or not lol,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

However, a member of Drake’s camp insisted it was real, with OVO Hush saying on social media: “When you find out this is real don’t forget how trash it was as an A.I. [shrug emoji].”
The 6 God appeared to laugh off the alleged diss track by posting a crying face emoji on Hush’s post.

Drake has also been bitten by AI fakes in his escalating feud with Kendrick. A second alleged diss track from Drizzy called “Hi Whitney” — a nod to Kendrick’s wife — surfaced earlier this week but was later confirmed by Drake himself to be fake.
Akademiks said on his Rumble livestream: “He hit me. I guess when I was playing that ‘Hi Whitney’ shit, he said that’s AI. He said 100 percent AI, so I’m gonna take his word. But I ain’t gonna lie to you, that shit is slick.”
