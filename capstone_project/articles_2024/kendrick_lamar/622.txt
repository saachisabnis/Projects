The culprit allegedly got into an altercation with security before police arrived at the property, with the suspect then taken to hospital.
It was not reported what, if any, injuries the trespasser suffered that required hospital treatment.
Video footage uploaded to social media showed an ambulance at Drake’s compound.
In a tumultuous week for Drake, a drive-by shooting happened outside his Toronto home on Tuesday, which left a security guard seriously injured and hospitalized with the need for emergency surgery.
Just a day after the shooting, a man was stopped as he attempted to make his way into the rapper’s swanky Bridle Path property that is commonly known as “The Embassy.”

Law enforcement was alerted after Drizzy’s security team stopped the person from entering through the front gate, following which he got into a brief altercation with those who stopped him. The trespasser apparently claimed that he was “here to see Drake.”
The Toronto Police Department later said: “Officers were called after a person attempted to gain access to the property. The person was apprehended under the mental health act.”

It is not known if the three incidents are related to each other or have anything to do with Drake’s various feuds with Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky, among others. It is also not known if Drake was at home at the time of the incidents.
The rapper’s mansion was recently used as fodder in his high-profile beef with Kendrick, with the Compton rapper using a satellite picture of the property as the cover art for his scathing diss song “Not Like Us.”

The image was peppered with several red markers, allegedly from a sex predator app. Kendrick accused the 6 God and some of his close associates of being pedophiles on the song.
These are claims that Drake denied on his response record “The Heart Part 6.”
Neither Drake nor Kendrick have commented on the spate of incidents that have occurred at the former’s house.
