Joe Budden has become notorious for saying incendiary things on his eponymous podcast. However, when he mentioned R&B singer Ari Lennox on a recent episode the star didn’t take too kindly to Budden’s remarks.
On Tuesday’s episode of the “Joe Budden Podcast,” the controversial host discussed J.Cole’s apology for dissing Kendrick Lamar with “7 Minute Drill.” Lamar first came for Cole with his viral “Like That” verse. 
“I don’t want to hear no more about that record,” Budden said about “7 Minute Drill.” “It sounded like he didn’t mean it. His voice was trembling like he didn’t mean it. His choice of words as one of the greatest lyricists says he didn’t mean it.”
 Of course, Budden didn’t stop there. 
“I don’t want to hear a f**king peep out of Earthstone Twitter … Cole is on that— Y’all think I’d be playing with the Ari Lennox, Scottie… They do all that earthy college campus, grass root s**t. If you listen to [J. Cole’s] raps, he just been trying to be the best f**king— the best rapper, the best MC. But it been, you got to listen to the n***as story. It’s been college life.”
In response to being called out by Budden for literally no reason, Lennox shared a clip to her Instagram Stories of the podcaster getting punched by rapper Consequence during a “Love and Hip Hop: New York” reunion taping from 2013. Lennox, who is not known for usually being petty, hilariously let the clip play on a loop.
She also followed up with a statement directed at Budden: “Knocked your little glasses off and everything. Keep my precious name out of your psychotic, animal abusing, women terrorizing, demonic trolling, nicotine encased mouth. All this meth smoke for a woman but not for any man beating your a** in real life. Bald b**ch!”
This isn’t the first time Budden has gone after Black women. He reportedly mistreated his former “State of the Culture” co-host Scottie Beam (he referenced her in that J.Cole comment as well) and used his platform to attack Megan Thee Stallion when Tory Lanez was on trial for shooting her back in 2020.
