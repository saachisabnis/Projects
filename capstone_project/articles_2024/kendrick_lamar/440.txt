Kendrick Lamar might just be having the best year ever, and next year is looking just as bright! The Kendrick takeover continues as he’s just been named as the headliner for the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show, set to go down on February 9, 2025, at the iconic Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The NFL, Roc Nation, and Apple Music dropped the bombshell announcement on Sunday, and the internet is buzzing with excitement. The Super Bowl stage is one of the biggest in the world, and Kendrick Lamar’s about to bless it again, only this time as the SOLO headliner.  This comes fresh off the back of that high-profile clash with Drake that had everybody talking. So, does this mean Kendrick won the battle and is now sitting on the throne?
Ever since “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City” dropped in 2012, Kendrick has been on a run. Seventeen Grammys later, and even a Pulitzer Prize for “DAMN.”, it’s safe to say K-Dot isn’t just a rapper—he’s a cultural force. And with his creative powerhouse, pgLang, running the show, you know this Halftime performance is about to slap. Kendrick’s “Big Steppers” tour already had the people going crazy, so imagine what he’s cooking up for theSuper Bowl stage.
What tracks do we expect on the set list for this epic performance? Kendrick’s got a vault of hits.
1. HUMBLE (2017)
2. Alright (2015)
3. DNA (2017)
4. Swimming Pools (Drank) (2012)
5. Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe (2012)
6. Money Trees ft. Jay Rock (2012)
7. LOVE  ft. Zacari (2017)
8. King Kunta (2015)
9. Poetic Justice NO DRAKE (2012)
10. THEY NOT LIKE US  (2024)
The question everyone wants to know, who’s hopping on stage with Kendrick? You know Super Bowl performances often turn into mini-festivals with surprise guests, so the possibilities are endless. Could we see Baby Keem, his cousin and frequent collaborator, pull up for a “Family Ties” moment? Or will the legend Dr. Dre make another appearance, bringing us back to that iconic 2022 Halftime show? Maybe SZA, the first lady of Top Dawg, will show up for a sultry collab, or even J. Cole, squashing any lingering beef and giving us a moment for the culture. And listen, if pgLang is directing the show, you know it’ll be more than just a performance—it’s gonna be an experience.
We can’t talk Kendrick without diving into the elephant in the room: that Drake beef. Their back-and-forth in 2024 was wild, with Kendrick lyrically flexing and eventually dropping the chart-topping “Not Like Us,” which sat at No. 1 for two weeks straight. Drake fired shots, but the streets (and the charts) seemed to favor Kendrick. And now, headlining the Super Bowl? That’s the kind of W that makes it hard to argue against Kendrick’s reign. While Drake’s got hits for days, Kendrick’s got the crown—and he’s performing on the world’s biggest stage to prove it.
So, is this Kendrick’s victory lap? Super Bowl LIX is about to be lit. Stay tuned—February 2025!
