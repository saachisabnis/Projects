In the immediate aftermath of Kendrick Lamar’s recent rap beef victory over Drake, NXT head honcho Shawn Michaels invited both men onto the show to settle their difference.
That attempt at grabbing some hip-hop headlines didn’t work. But the angle HBK & team have cooking with NXT champion Trick Williams and Williams’ real-life girlfriend Lash Legend did grab the attention of rapper Sexyy Red. 
Red, a new rap star out of St. Louis, tweeted that Legend’s group the Meta-Four should watch their back after its leader Noam Dar used the champ’s relationship as a way to set himself up as #1 contender. A report quickly followed that her social media post was planned in conjunction with WWE to set-up her further involvement in the storyline, and — sure enough — last night (May 20) Sexyy announced she’ll be on the May 28 episode of NXT.
She’s also ready to channel her inner Viper:
I can’t wait to go to NXT next week yall I might RKO somebody    @WWE #nxt
Will Red go full Randy Orton on one of the Meta-Four? Will WWE save that for NXT’s Battleground premium live event on June 9 in Las Vegas? Is this how Legend officially parts ways with Dar & company, or is Trick headed for heartbreak?
We should get some answers next Tuesday.
