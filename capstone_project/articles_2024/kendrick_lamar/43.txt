On Monday, July 29, diamond-certified producer Metro Boomin’ will host the ‘Metro Boomin and Friends’ concert at The Pageant in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. The concert will serve as the official send off the GRAMMY nominated producer before he heads off to the T-Mobile Arena in Kansas City, Missouri for the opening night of Future and Metro Boomin’s We Trust You Tour.
Metro Boomin’ has spent the last year dominating the charts. From curating the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse soundtrack to producing two albums with Future, the St. Louis native has impacted music and more broadly, pop culture. Not to mention, the Metro Boomin-produced track, “Like That,” ignited the most recent back and forth between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
As the year comes to an end, the critically acclaimed producer will tour the world with his longtime collaborator, Future. Their tour will kick off in Kansas City before making its way to Chicago for Lollapalooza. Afterward, the duo will make their way through North America, making stops in Toronto, Philadelphia, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and several other major cities. Ultimately, the tour will end September 9 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
