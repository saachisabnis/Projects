If there’s anything Hip Hop fans love debating more than rankings or rap beef (or, as recent times have shown, lawsuits), it’s album sales.
Times have certainly changed since the days when the likes of Eminem, 50 Cent and Lil Wayne were shifting over a million copies in a single week in their aughties primes, back when people actually bought CDs.

Album sales are counted much differently these days in the streaming era, and as Audiomack co-founder Brian Zisook recently pointed out, sales are no longer the be all and end all of an artist’s career given the on-demand nature of streaming and increased focus on more profitable revenue streams (i.e. touring, merch).
Yet first-week units remain an important measuring stick for an artist’s commercial standing, cultural cachet and ability to rally their fanbase, even as some artists themselves have attempted to downplay their value (which is totally valid if you prefer to drown out the noise and judge music based solely on quality).

Compared to previous years, 2024 has been a relatively tame year in Hip Hop when it comes to first-week sales, despite the fact that the genre remains the most popular in the U.S. and streaming revenues have continued to grow. No project this year has cracked the 400,000 mark, which hasn’t happened since 2014.
In fact, the rap album with the biggest single-week sales tally this year was originally released a decade ago: Travis Scott’s reissued mixtape Days Before Rodeo. Not even Kendrick Lamar’s high-profile feud with Drake could fuel GNX to pole position, while perennial sales behemoth Eminem posted relatively modest numbers with his alter ego-burying The Death of Slim Shady.

Long-awaited albums from Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre (Missionary, 36K), Big Sean (Better Me Than You, 23K), Childish Gambino (Bando Stone & The New World, 35K) also mustered some of the lowest figures in their respective catalogs.
Still, 2024 was not without major wins for some. Tyler, The Creator scored the biggest sales tally of his career with Chromakopia, as did 21 Savage with American Dream and Metro Boomin with We Don’t Trust You.

Future flooded the Billboard charts with a trifecta of number one albums during his monster run, while the polarizing Yeat proved his cheerleaders outweight his critics as he earned his first chart-topping project along with two of the biggest first-week sales of any rapper.
