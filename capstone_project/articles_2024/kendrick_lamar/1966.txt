Fans looking forward to catching Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna at Coachella 2025 will be sorely disappointed as the two A-listers reportedly declined the opportunity to serve as next year’s headliners.
Sources tell Bloomberg that the two passed on the opportunity for different reasons; Dot is already confirmed to headline the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show next February, while Rih — the 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show headliner — isn’t interested in the big payout nor the exposure. It’s also reported that Lamar is currently plotting a stadium tour, however nothing is confirmed as of writing.
Bloomberg adds that concert promoter Paul Tollett is looking for headliners that will ensure a sold-out 2025 festival after Coachella failed to sell out the past two years. Booking major headliners have gotten increasingly difficult in recent years as these artists now have the star power to earn more from solo shows in comparison to festivals; while Coachella pays between $8 million USD to $12 million USD for both weekends, the likes of Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have the ability to make up to $15 million USD in just one night.
Frank Ocean’s 2023 headlining slot also did more damage to the festival’s reputation as the organizers were also blamed for the mishap. The artist began his set late and ended his performance just a little over an hour later, causing fans in-attendance to boo him in disappointment. Ocean then cancelled his appearance for weekend two.
