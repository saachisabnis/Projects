It looks like the culture will continue to headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The NFL has announced they have extended their deal with Roc Nation to curate the festivities.
As spotted on Yahoo! Entertainment, the National Football League will continue their partnership with Jay-Z to curate their biggest event of the year. As exclusively reported by Bloomberg News, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell disclosed the deal saying the partnership is “mutually positive” while attending the annual owners meeting in Atlanta. “I’m not sure either one of us really spend much time talking about contracts. Jay is happy” he said. “Desiree Perez is happy. I’m happy, so we’re all good.”
Back in 2019, the NFL signed the original deal with Roc Nation to curate the Halftime Show festivities. According to ESPN, the original contract was for about $25 million over a five-year term. In addition to choosing the talent, Roc Nation also assisted in the league’s commitment to social justice via their Inspire Change program. Since then, the Super Bowl has featured some of the culture’s biggest and brightest stars. In 2022, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige and Eminem took the stage. Rihanna headlined the show in 2023, and Usher took the baton earlier this year.
Kendrick Lamar has been chosen as the headliner for Super Bowl LIX. It is set to take place on Feb. 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, La.
