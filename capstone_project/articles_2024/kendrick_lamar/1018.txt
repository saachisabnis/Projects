ScHoolboy Q voiced his displeasure about the first show of his Blue Lips Weekend tour getting canceled, and he thinks the Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef has something to do with it.

	The tour was set to kick off Thursday (July 18) with a sold-out show at History in Toronto, Canada, but Wednesday night, the TDE rapper alleged that the show was scrapped due to safety concerns. “They just cancelled my show in Toronto,” he tweeted Wednesday. “Canadian police don’t want nobody from TDE performing.”

THey just cancelled my sHow in TORONTO 😂…  CANADIAN POLICE DONT WANT NOBODY FROM TDE PERFORMING..

	Q also mentioned Kendrick’s camp has been keeping things on wax while alluding Drake — who is from Toronto — and OVO had something to do with the situation. He pointed out his label boss Top Dawg met up with Lil Wayne and Baby at the YouTube Leaders & Legends Gala, and that OVO artist Partynextdoor had just performed at the Hollywood Palladium. “TOP was just wit Wayne & Baby smH,” he tweeted. “Partynextdoor just had a show at the palladium. If we wanted to get y’all we would’ve just did it.. now when somebody gets hurt don’t cry.”
TOP was just wit Wayne & Baby smH partynextdoor just Had a sHow @ tHe palladium 🤦🏾‍♂️ if we wanted to get yall we would’ve just did it..  now wHen sumbody get Hurt don’t cry…

	He quickly got over it, though, and laughed at the irony and ridiculousness of it all. “Actually I get it,” he tweeted. “Nevermind, this s—t is lowkey hilarious. I don’t know why Dot put me in that f—ing video.”

	One fan replied to that tweet with a screenshot of ScHoolboy standing stoically in the “Not Like Us” video, to which the rapper poked fun at himself, tweeting, “Cancelled is all I could think about.”

History — the venue ScHoolboy was set to perform in — is owned by Live Nation in collaboration with Drake.

Billboard has reached out to Drake, History as well as Toronto law enforcement for comment.

Rick Ross was attacked after a show June 30 in Vancouver, B.C., as he walked off the stage with “Not Like Us” playing in the background. Back in 2018, Pusha T was also attacked while he was performing in Toronto. 

	Major rainfall and flooding have hit Toronto hard in recent days, leaving 100,000 residents without power. Drake posted a video of himself trying to control the flooding in his mansion to no avail.

	Q’s next tour stop is in Chicago this Saturday (July 20).
