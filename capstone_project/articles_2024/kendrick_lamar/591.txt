Drake has trolled Rick Ross after he got sucker punched at a festival in Canada for playing Kendrick Lamar‘s diss song “Not Like Us.”
In a video posted online on Monday (July 1), Drizzy wished fans a Happy Canada Day and said, “Cheers to the whole country” as he sipped on an alcoholic drink.

In a separate post, the 6 God filmed himself enjoying some Canada Day celebrations while he rapped along to “Northern Touch” by the Rascalz, who, not coincidentally, are from Vancouver, the city where Ross got jumped.
Drake’s subtly shady post caught the attention of Rozay’s ex Tia Kemp, who gushed over the Toronto rap star in the comments section with a heart eyes emoji, to which he replied: “My goat.”
In response, Rozay mocked the pair over their unlikely alliance, commenting: “Pedo vs granny.”

The MMG mogul previously shrugged off the brawl that saw him and his entourage get attacked by a group of apparent Drake supporters.
After a clip of the incident went viral, Ross wrote on Instagram: “I thought they were bottle service boys. Ha!”

He also shared a photo of himself in front of his private jet along with the caption: “Vancouver it was fun, till next time.”
The violent incident, which erupted after Ross played “Not Like Us” during his set at Ignite Music Festival, also saw the Teflon Don get taunted by longtime foe 50 Cent.

In a follow-up video, 50 expressed fake concern for Rozay and his entourage while discussing the brawl.
“Hey guys. I just saw a very unfortunate situation that took place in Canada, and I want to say to everyone that I hope that that brother made it home safely,” he said. “I hope that he now has a different perspective and a better sense of what to do and what not to do while you’re out in the world.”
