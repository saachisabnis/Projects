ScHoolboy Q recently released his highly anticipated sixth studio album Blue Lips, which features Devin Malik on two tracks. Based on that, Kendrick Lamar seems to already be a fan of the newcomer’s work.
On Thursday (March 21), Malik, who made cameos on “Back n Love” and “Love Birds” on the aforementioned album, took to social media to share a series of photographs with K.Dot inside what appears to be a studio.

In the Twitter post, he wrote, “i just met kendrick & he told me ‘u the kid that went crazy on blue lips’ ?!?!!!” His Instagram collage of photos from the same meeting was captioned: “GOOD KID MAAD TUX.”

Earlier this month, ScHoolboy Q made it clear that he will never stop making music, as he can’t even imagine his life as anything but an artist. The Los Angeles rapper sat down for an interview with Nadeska in mid-March, during which he admitted that he wouldn’t know what to do with himself were he were forced to retire from rap.

“I’ll never retire — never,” he began. “Artists can’t retire. It’s like, impossible. I’m not saying I’m gonna be rappin’ forever, but I’ll never retire from music. I just don’t see it. How is that possible?
“Snoop’s still doin’ it. Dre’s still doin’ it. Nas’s still doin’ it. Jay’s still doin’ it. Em’s still doin’ it. I’mma do it too. I keep sayin’: I’m going out like B.B. King [who performed until several months before his death at 89].”

He continued: “I’m rappin’ until I’m 80. DJ Premier’s still doin’ it. He’s in his 50s. Rap is still new, so we don’t have that many 80-year-old’s still killin’ it. I’m gonna be 80, still on the mic, crackin’.
“I’ma be doing this shit forever. I don’t ever plan on stopping. ‘Cause this is all I got. This is the way I express myself. I don’t need a therapist, I got a microphone.”

Prior to that, the 37-year-old MC revealed that he once passed on a beat that went on to be a major hit for Travis Scott. During an appearance on the Back On Figg podcast, he recalled producer Cardo giving him the beat to “Goosebumps” first.
“Every Cardo beat you heard, I done had it,” Q said. “I had all these beats.”

When asked which one he regrets turning down, he singled out “Goosebumps.”
“[Cardo] named the beat ‘Goosebumps.’ And I kept trying to get on the record … I couldn’t come up with nothing. I guess he sent it to Travis.”

Q added: “Every time me and Travis see each other we always laugh about it ’cause it’s like, ‘Bruh you just took the name of the beat and made that joint. I blew it!’ The beat was just called ‘Goosebumps.’ That’s one of my regrets, bro.”
