Tom Hanks had a hilarious dad moment with his son Chet after he asked him to explain Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef.Chet had social media cracking up on Monday, May 20 after he shared a screenshot of his hilarious text exchange with his pops. The Forrest Gump star started the conversation by asking "Big Main" to break down the feud between Drizzy and K. Dot. Chet replied with a concise explanation of what happened from Drake and J. Cole's "First Person Shooter" down to the success of Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us." "Holy cow! These are fighting words," his dad replied. "People taking sides?? Who's winning??" 
“Did you not just read what I said," Chet laughed. Drake and Kendrick Lamar's high-profile beef is one of the most glorified feuds in Hip-Hop history. The top-chart artists hurled numerous scathing insults at one another as they went song-for-song for several weeks. Following their epic back-and-forth, TDE's Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith declared the battle was over shortly after "Not Like Us" dropped. Drake appeared to agree that the battle was done for now, but didn't exactly concede to Kendrick. After things died down, the feud continued to remain fresh in pop culture and politics. Drake and Kendrick's battle has been cited on shows like "Saturday Night Live," which had Dua Lipa breaking down the meaning of Drizzy's "Push Ups." The beef also made it to our nation's capital after President Joe Biden’s campaign used lyrics from Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" to attack presidential candidate Donald Trump in a video. The debate about who won still rages on among fans and critics. Recently, Drake's friend Lil Yachty offered his thoughts on the battle after Kendrick dragged him into it by mentioning him on "Euphoria." In a now-deleted episode of his podcast A Safe Place, Yachty acknowledged the general consensus that Kendrick won and agreed "Not Like Us" was a banger. His thoughts angered fans who accused Yachty of betraying Drizzy.
