Lamar, 37, has experienced massive success since his debut album "good kid, m.A.A.d city" in 2012. Since then, he's accumulated 17 Grammy wins and became the first non-classical, non-jazz musician to win a Pulitzer Prize for his 2017 album "DAMN."
The surprise release caps a big year for the Lamar, who featured on the song "Like That" with Future and Metro Boomin â€” a track that spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this year. He also scored another hit with "Not Like Us," a track emanating from the Drake feud.
