Mustard is capitalizing on his success from producing Kendrick Lamar‘s “Not Like Us” with plans for a new album.

“FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED SUMMER 2024,” he wrote with a teaser clip. “A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU. LOVE Y’ALL. SEE YOU SOON.”
The clip is set over a sermon that references the album title, encapsulating the overall theme of faith and perseverance. Throughout the video, a montage showcases the 34-year-old with his children, going through his fitness journey, studio sessions, early days in his career and more.
Faith Of A Mustard Seed follows 2019’s Perfect 10, which featured the hits “Pure Water” with Migos and “Ballin” with Roddy Ricch.
Outside of music, Mustard just announced he’s expecting a child with his new girlfriend, Brittany Stroud.

The Los Angeles native recently proposed altering their custody arrangement so that he could have sole custody of their 11-year-old son.
He made the proposition after getting into a dispute with her over a low-rated public school she enrolled their son in. The beatmaker claimed that Thierry has been “defensive” about his involvement and treated the matter “like a contest that she must win at all costs, even if that cost is irreparable educational harm” to their kid.
