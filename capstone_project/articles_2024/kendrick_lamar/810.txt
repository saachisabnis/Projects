J. Cole made it clear he intends to update or remove his new song that drags Kendrick Lamar, “7 Minute Drill,” featured on his aptly named new album, “Might Delete Later.”
On the record, J Cole says Lamar’s prime is far behind, and he calls his latest album ‘Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers’ “tragic.”
While performing, J. Cole rapped a different tune on Sunday, saying his song no longer “sits right with my spirit.” He now feels “terrible” for taking a verbal shot at the beloved rapper.
Though Cole’s words did not come out of thin air, the exchange began in October. J. Cole and Drake, in the song “First Person Shooter,” ranked themselves, with Lamar, as the “big three” in hip-hop.

In due time, Lamar reacted to his contemporaries in the song “Like That” by Future and St. Louisan Metro Boomin, rapping that there was no big three, “it’s just big me.”
