Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s “Like That” scores a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, a week after it launched at the summit.

	Meanwhile, Beyoncé claims three songs in the Hot 100’s top 10: former two-week leader “Texas Hold ‘Em” rebounds 11-2; “II Most Wanted,” with Miley Cyrus, debuts at No. 6; and Beyoncé’s update of Dolly Parton’s classic “Jolene” begins at No. 7. All three tracks are from Beyoncé’s album Cowboy Carter, which soars in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 407,000 equivalent album units in the United States March 29-April 4, according to Luminate – the biggest week for a set in 2024. It also opens as the superstar’s first No. 1 on the Top Country Albums and Americana/Folk Albums charts.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated April 13, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 9. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.

	“Like That,” on Boominati/Freebandz/Republic/Epic Records, drew 46.1 million streams (down 23%) and 10.1 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 81%) and sold 6,000 (down 29%) March 29-April 4.

	The single adds a second week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart and falls 2-8 on Digital Song Sales.

	A week earlier, “Like That” blasted in at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as Future and Lamar’s third leader each and Metro Boomin’s first as a billed recording artist (following two as a writer and producer), as parent LP We Don’t Trust You by Future and Metro Boomin bounded in atop the Billboard 200.

	“Like That” concurrently tops the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, which use the same multimetric methodology as the Hot 100, for a second week each.

	Beyoncé infuses the Hot 100’s top 10 with three songs — led by former two-week No. 1 “Texas Hold ‘Em,” which rebounds 11-2 with 47.9 million in airplay audience (up 3%), 26.9 million streams (up 89%) and 15,000 sold (up 97%), as it wins the chart’s top Streaming and Sales Gainer honors. It also rebounds for a third week atop Digital Song Sales and rules the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for an eighth week.

	Two more songs from Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter ride onto the Hot 100 in the top 10: “II Most Wanted,” with Miley Cyrus, debuts at No. 6, led by 25.2 million first-week streams, and Beyoncé’s reimagining of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” bows at No. 7 with 22.4 million streams.

	Beyoncé ups her count to 24 Hot 100 top 10s as a soloist. (Destiny’s Child, with her as a member, tallied 10 top 10s in 1998-2005.) Cyrus achieves her 13th top 10.

Most Billboard Hot 100 Top 10s:

	Beyoncé surpasses Whitney Houston for the sixth-most Hot 100 top 10s among women – and both stars’ counts have direct ties to Dolly Parton.

	Houston last ranked in the Hot 100’s top 10 in 2012, following her passing, as her cover of Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” re-entered and reached No. 3. It originally reigned on the chart for (a then-record) 14 weeks in 1992-93.

	Parton posts her first Hot 100 top 10 writing credit since then, thanks to Beyoncé’s reworking of “Jolene,” which augments the lyrics of the original. The classic hit No. 60 on the Hot 100 for Parton, marking her first appearance, in 1974, and crowned Hot Country Songs for a week that year, becoming the second of her 25 No. 1s, the most among women. The song also earned Parton a 1975 Grammy nomination for best female country vocal performance for the recording, while a live version earned her a nod in the category the following year.

	In its only other Hot 100 appearance until this week, “Jolene” spent a week at No. 76 in 2011 via Vicci Martinez’s version, from her run as a contestant on NBC’s The Voice.

	Parton, meanwhile, expands her career top 10 span as a writer on the Hot 100 to 43 years, two months and two weeks, dating to her first week in the region as a writer with her self-penned “9 to 5” on the chart dated Jan. 31, 1981. (The song became the first of her two No. 1s as a recording artist that February.)

	Elsewhere in the Hot 100’s top 10, Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” holds at No. 3, after reaching No. 2. It wears the chart’s top Airplay Gainer ribbon for a second consecutive week (50.5 million, up 23%).

	Hozier’s “Too Sweet” rises 5-4 in its second week on the Hot 100, led by a 10% gain to 31.8 million streams, as it tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a second frame.

	Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” dips 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after reaching No. 1, and, below Beyoncé’s debuts, Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” descends 7-8, following six nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning last December, as it logs a 12th week atop the Radio Songs chart (66 million, down 6%).

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Ariana Grande’s “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” climbs 10-9, three weeks after it debuted as her ninth No. 1, and Future, Metro Boomin, Travis Scott and Playboi Carti’s “Type Shit” falls 2-10 in its second week on the survey.

	Again, for all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on Billboard’s social accounts, and all charts (dated April 13), including the Hot 100 in its entirety, will refresh on Billboard.com tomorrow (April 9).
