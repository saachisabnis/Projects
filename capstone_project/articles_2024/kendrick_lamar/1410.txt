Suge Knight has once again put the blame on Snoop Dogg for 2Pac‘s untimely demise, this time while discussing his disdain for Drake‘s newest song.
Drizzy’s second Kendrick Lamar diss, “Taylor Made Freestyle,” employs the use of AI to “feature” the likeness of both Pac and Snoop – something Suge believes is not at all okay.

“Young people do what young people do. It’s y’all turn, but regarding the homie ‘Pac, he wasn’t no chump,” he said on the latest episode of Collect Call With Suge Knight via Dave Mays’ Breakbeat Media. “Putting him on a song and dissing Kendrick [Lamar] for everybody entertainment — that ain’t how it go.
“Then putting him on a song with Snoop, who was a part of his downfall and exit, ain’t ever a good look. ‘Pac was a king on that chessboard. He never was a pawn, so he can’t make him be a pawn now.”

He went on to warn the Canadian superstar that gang affiliates in Los Angeles don’t play about this kind of thing.
Snoop Dogg was just as surprised as the rest of the Hip Hop community to hear his voice featured on Drake’s song as well. Soon after the song went live, the Long Beach native took to social and shared a hilarious reaction to the aforementioned “cameo.”
“They did what? When? How? Are you sure? [Sigh] Y’all have a good night,” he said in a brief Instagram clip. “Why everybody calling my phone, blowing me up? What the fuck— what happened? What’s going on? I’m going back to bed. Good night.”

As for the former Death Row Records boss blaming Tha Doggfather for ‘Pac’s death, he said last year that his former artist has some “explaining” to do.
In an explosive segment on his Collect Call podcast, the currently incarcerated record executive (who was in the car with ‘Pac the night he was shot in Las Vegas) questioned Snoop’s role in the death of the rap legend.

When asked about Diddy’s alleged involvement in the murder, he turned his attention to Snoop instead and said he wants a face-to-face talk with the “Gin and Juice” hitmaker, who now owns Death Row Records.
“As far as the Puffy situation, I really, really, really gotta have a real conversation with Snoop,” he said. “I knew that ‘Pac did everything right by him by putting him on All Eyez On Me, speaking about him and being real with him. And if it’s true what they say, face-to-face it’s gonna be a lot of explaining to do.”
