Drake has an enemy lurking close to him, according to Akademiks — and fans are convinced he’s talking about Travis Scott.
Speaking on his Rumble livestream, the controversial Hip Hop personality said: “I found out Drake has an opp that none of us know that is a huge rapper that we all think is his friend! I found that out like two days ago.

“I won’t even drop the name. I need to do more digging on that. Some of y’all have guessed it […] They got big records together. That n-gga hates him too. I’m like, ‘What?!’ How come everybody hates him?!”
After a viewer commented on his stream suggesting it’s Drake’s Her Loss collaborator 21 Savage, Ak confirmed that it’s not him.

As Ak’s comments circulated social media, many fans began speculating that the enemy in question is Travis Scott, who has collaborated with the 6 God on the smash hit “Sicko Mode,” as well as “Meltdown,” “Fair Trade” and “Pussy & Millions.”
One fan posted on X (formerly Twitter): “‘They got big records together’ it’s definitely Travis,” while another boldly claimed: “Travis 100%.”

One user also shared a clip of Travis urging Metro Boomin to play “Like That,” which ignited the recent feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, during a show.
Another suggested that Drizzy and La Flame’s rumored beef was hiding in plain sight on the former’s diss song “Push Ups.”
“I told n-ggas that ‘Rolling Loud stage y’all were turnt, that was slick as hell. Shit’ll probably change if ya BM start to kiss & tell’ line was a shot at Travis but y’all called me crazy lmao,” they wrote.
methinks it's Travis Scott who might not actually jive with Drake lol

Others speculated that the “opp” Akademiks was referring to could also be Lil Wayne, Lil Baby or 2 Chainz, none of whom have publicly supported Drake in his “20 versus 1” battle against Kendrick and co.
Drake has seen many former friends and collaborators turn against on him in recent months including Future, Rick Ross, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky.

The result was diss tracks exchanged by various parties, with Drake and Kendrick going back and forth over the following month before Drizzy all but tapped out after “The Heart Part 6.”
Rozay also got involved when he dropped “Champagne Moments” where he accused his former “Money in the Grave” collaborator of undergoing plastic surgery including a Brazilian butt lift.
