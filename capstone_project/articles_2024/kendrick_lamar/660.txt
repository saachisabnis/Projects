Many people have been making lists and checking them twice this time of the year.
Especially music fans.
Choosing the best of the past 12 months — albums and singles, artists and concerts — is an annual ritual that pits passions and tastes in lengthy discussions (polite term) about the year’s standouts, seeking consensus, but being satisfied to agree to disagree. The good news is there’s been so much good music throughout 2024 that it takes more than a couple of checks to determine a satisfactory list.
With that in mind, and after plenty of chin-scratching and hand-wringing, these are our picks for the year’s 12 best albums — with, of course, some honorable mentions …
Black Crowes, “Happiness Bastards” (Silver Arrow): The Crowes’ first new album in 15 years recaptures the rocking abandon of its first few releases and throws a defiant middle finger to those who consider rock ‘n’ roll dead.
The Black Keys, “Ohio Players” (Easy Eye Sound/Nonesuch): With a little help from more friends than usual — including Beck, Oasis’ Noel Gallagher, Dan the Automator and rappers Juicy J and Lil Noid — the duo spices its bluesy garage rock with some fresh ingredients for a truly tasty adventure.
The Cure, “Songs of a Lost World” (Fiction/Capitol): Robert Smith and company made us wait 16 years for something new — and made something worth the wait. The years have expanded Smith’s worldview, and the song arrangements resonate with the same textural beauty of the Cure’s best previous work.
Doechii, “Alligator Bites Never Heal” (Top Dawg/Capitol): From lyricism to delivery, Florida rapper Jaylah Ji’mya Hickmon is an original voice in the genre, bringing the boom with commanding authority — and without the usual plethora of featured guests. This is considered a mixtape, but it’s as complete as any album you put it next to.
David Gilmour, “Luck and Strange” (Sony Music): A nine-year gap did not diminish the Pink Floyd guitarist’s skills or taste — or willingness to stretch thanks to new co-producer Charlie Andrews. All nine tracks are tastefully crafted gems, and when Gilmour tucks into a solo there are few who are his equal.
Ian Hunter, “Defiance Part 2: Fiction” (Sun): File this under rock is not dead, too. The Mott the Hoople frontman’s second album in as many years kicks just as hard as its predecessor, with just as many guests — including one of the late Jeff Beck’s final recordings. Hunter is more lyrically pointed, as well, pouring fuel onto an already ferocious fire.
Justice, “Hyperderma” (Ed Banger/Beyond Music): The French electronic duo’s fourth studio album, and first in eight years, hits on all cylinders, blending pop smarts with dance grooves and rock flavors, aided by guests such as Tame Impala, Miguel, Thundercat and others.
Kacey Musgraves, “Deeper Well” (MCA Nashville/Interscope): An apt title for Musgraves’ sixth album, on which she finds firm footing in her combination of country, pop and folk, and lyrics that mine territory that’s both topical and personal. The subsequent expanded release “Deeper Into the Well” adds seven more gems, including collaborations with Leon Bridges and Tiny Habits.
Rufus Du Soul, “Inhale/Exhale” (Rose Avenue/Reprise): We’d defy anyone to sit still for this Australian trio’s fifth studio album, a collection of grooves and textures that combine for nearly an hour of euphoric listening — or dancing. The lead single, “Music is Better,” is an understatement in this case.
Twanguero, “Panamerica” (Cosmica Artists): Named after the boat on which Diego Garcia wrote the songs, “Panamerica” is an aural travelogue from Spain and Latin America to the Mississippi Delta and Memphis. It shrinks the world but enlarges our appreciation of how easy it is to blast through borders and create something exciting — and meaningful.
Jack White, “No Name” (Third Man): Another surprise release — initially free to customers at Third Man Records stores one Friday in July — that veers from the conceptual ambitions of his pair of 2022 albums and tears it up with the blues-stepped garage rock that’s at his core.
Charli XCX, “Brat” (Atlantic): The British singer caught listeners a bit off guard with the raw, rave-ready attack of her sixth album — even before Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign elevated its stature. Never one to mess around with, Charli does not mess around on these 15 tracks (and even more on the subsequent “Brat and It’s the Same but There’s Three More Songs So It’s Not” deluxe edition.
