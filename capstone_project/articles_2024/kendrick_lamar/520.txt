Nicolas de Parcel, the Mastering Engineer of Kendrick Lamar‘s Drake disses, opened up about the experience of working on the selection of tracks with MixedByAli’s EngineEars.
The engineer recalled the “high-pressure” real-time processes of “euphoria,” “Meet The Grahams” and “Not Like Us,” stating, “It was a little crazy. I got a call and it was like, ‘Stay on call, you’re gonna be working.’ I would get the song and like, six minutes would elapse, and they’d be like, ‘How we looking?’ It was very high-pressure.”
de Parcel continued, “As Dot was releasing these records, it was like, I was turning in the masters. It would drop like 12 minutes later…It was amazing.”
As we know, “Not Like Us” would go on to log two non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and sold a million units in just under one month.
