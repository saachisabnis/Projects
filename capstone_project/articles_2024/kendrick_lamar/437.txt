Muni Long recently revealed that she had once written a song for Rihanna in the time it takes to warm up a baked potato.
In a chat with Complex, which dropped on Friday (March 8), the “Made For Me” chanteuse said that it was one of the easiest jobs she’d had — and that she originally thought the tune was going to go to Kelly Clarkson.

“I was in Miami at the time for ‘California King Bed,’ working out of We The Best studio, and I was actually working with Jermaine [Jackson] from The Runners,” she said. “They had the chords and everything. I listened, I went back into the room, and they gave me the file.”
During the studio session, Long revealed, she was actually shopping for furniture online due to an impending move. That’s what inspired the track’s title.

She continued: “I wrote the song in like 10 minutes. I was like, ‘Turn it up, let me get this done real quick,’ so I could go back to looking for my furniture. Originally, they were trying to pitch it to Kelly Clarkson. Then I came back two months later, and my publisher Ryan Press said that they were going to cut it for Rihanna. I was super excited.”
Back in January, Muni Long made headlines when she took to TikTok to reveal that she wasn’t happy about her label’s parent company’s decision to pull all their music from the platform.

The “Made for Me” singer took to TikTok on January 31 to share her thoughts on the matter. In the caption, she suggested that she was in therapy for the record label drama, then revealed in her video that she felt it was some sort of sabotage to her career.
“I mean, it’s not like they are refusing to support my music until I prove that it’s valuable by investing my own money, and maybe, possibly, lucking up on a hot TikTok trend or anything like that,” she wrote, referring to the “Made for Me” challenge.
