He opens the first verse by confronting the custody battle with his ex-girlfriend over his three-year-old son, which was recently settled with a joint arrangement.
“I been goin’ through child support/ A good daddy, I vouch for it/ She just want a new mile for/ Fuck a ride, fell out with some of my homies, havin’ too much pride,” he raps.

Later in the track, Roddy raps about his struggle quitting lean: “Pride myself off the progress of being off codeine/ I promise, it’s so hard to shake.”

The Compton native’s custody battle with ex-girlfriend Alexandra Kiser came to a conclusion earlier this month, with the rapper having physical custody of their son Tuesday through until Thursday every week.
He also agreed to pay Kiser $8,000 a month in child support, in addition to private school tuition, medical bills, special-needs therapy and extracurricular activities.

Kiser’s legal bill of $37,500 will also be covered by the rapper, and he also has to give her $1,000 a month so she can buy a car.
Kiser had earlier tried to gain sole custody of their child by making allegations about Roddy’s gang ties and drug problems.

“Rodrick Moore is gang-affiliated,” she said in a filing, using his government name. “He has been arrested on a gun charge, domestic violence and regularly indulges in promethazine use, all of which are concerns for myself and our son.”
Kiser also claimed that Roddy cut her off financially and was attempting to force her to move out of a home he provided. She originally asked the court to establish paternity in the case and for him to pay $20,000 a month in child support, which amounts to $240,000 annually.
