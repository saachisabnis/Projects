Two weeks after being called out by Kendrick Lamar in the song "Like That," J Cole responded fittingly on "7 Minute Drill," the final track of his surprise mixtape Might Delete Later. In this song, Cole directly addresses Kendrick's criticisms by questioning his artistic output, highlighting his frequent absence from the rap scene, and suggesting that he is seeking attention. Although Kendrick Lamar is not explicitly named in "7 Minute Drill," J. Cole's target is unmistakable, particularly through direct references to "Like That." For instance, Cole's lyric "Light work, like it's PWC" appears to be a subtle response to Kendrick's remark about his work being lightweight. Moreover, the line "I told him chill out, how I look having henchmen? / If shots get to popping, I'm the one doing the clenching" seems to counter Kendrick's mention of his bodyguard in "Like That," implying that Kendrick is not being genuine by hiding behind security. Therefore, J. Cole is challenging Kendrick to a one-on-one conflict and urging him to prove his words with actions.
