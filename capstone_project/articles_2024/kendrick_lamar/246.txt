In the cypher, Hart addressed his absence, saying, “You know I get a lot of questions on the daily… My answer to that is minding my fkin’ business.” His alter ego, Droppa, then launched into a fiery rap, challenging the “Big 3” of J. Cole, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar. He rapped, “All this talk about the Big 3, fk that, them not me? Goddamn, I’m mad. Oh sh*t, you sad? Well, it’s time to get glad, ’cause I’m back and I’m really mad.”
Hart’s appearance was unexpected and thrilling for fans. He made it clear that he was here to leave an impact, stating, “Sometimes you gotta pop out and show n***as. I guess this is my pop-out.” His verse included a shoutout to Cenat, “I’m streaming with Kai now. What that mean? I don’t know but I’m in it, you not.”
Hart’s return as Chocolate Droppa has sparked discussions about a potential musical comeback. The character first appeared in 2016 with a mixtape featuring artists like Metro Boomin and Lil Yachty. Droppa’s humorous yet serious approach to rap gained a unique following. Reflecting on Hart’s involvement, Droppa mentioned, “That’s a positive brother—somebody who always stood in my corner. He told me I had the potential to be the eighth or ninth best in the game.”
The AMP cypher also featured verses from streamers Duke Dennis, chrisnxtdoor, Agent 00, ImDavisss, and Fanum. Each brought their unique style, contributing to the cypher’s dynamic energy. Cenat’s verse, in particular, addressed his viral “friend-zone” moment, rapping, “I got a coupe, but it’s a Bez tho, kept it player even when she tell me that ‘we friends tho.’”
Hart’s freestyle ended with a dramatic exit, stating, “You don’t get the mic back after I just did what I did to it. This mic got to be burnt.” Fans are eagerly awaiting to see if this performance is a prelude to more music from Chocolate Droppa.
