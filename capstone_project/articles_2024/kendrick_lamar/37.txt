The ongoing rap battle between Drake and Kendrick Lamar continues, with Drake sharing a new song titled “The Heart Part 6”—a reference to the Pulitzer Prize winner’s ongoing single series. “And we know you’re dropping 6 mins after so instead of posting my address you have a lot to address,” he wrote on social media. Drake’s track responds to the two tracks Lamar dropped over the weekend, Friday’s late-night “Meet the Grahams” and Saturday’s “Not Like Us.” Listen to the new song below.
After Lamar took aim at Drake’s own parents, son, security guard, and label affiliates, the Toronto rapper is now claiming that he intentionally fed false information to people in hopes that Lamar would unknowingly use it in a track. (“The one’s that you’re getting your stories from, they’re all clowns,” Drake raps, “We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that’s 11 years old, I bet he takes it.”) Drake goes on to claim that Lamar’s songs are “trauma for your own confessions,” and directly states, “I never been with no one under age.”
Drake’s previous diss track, “Family Matters,” came out this past Friday (May 3). At the time, he was responding to Lamar’s successive “Euphoria” and “6:16 in LA.” This months-long beef all began with Lamar’s song “Like That” back in March. Since then, several other rappers have jumped in—and out—of the fight.
