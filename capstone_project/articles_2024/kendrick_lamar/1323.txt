50 Cent nearly lost 50 pounds.
The rapper reacted to rumors that he lost weight with the help of Ozempic in an Instagram video on Wednesday.
In the grainy clip, which appears to be taken in the back seat of a car, 50 cuts right to the chase and denied that he used the popular Type 2 diabetes drug to slim down.
“You wanna talk about weight loss? I was in the gym, I was working the f–k out, man,” the musician (real name Curtis Jackson) said. “And they say it’s Ozempic? I was running, I was running, I was doing what I had to do. You seen me on tour.”
He went on to reveal that he was 253 pounds and is now down to 210.
“So how you feel about it?” he asked.
According to Page Six, the musician has been on a “rigorous” training program for the past eight months. He’s been getting into tiptop shape by working out “three hours a day, every day” before he kicked off his Final Lap Tour last summer.
Last year, the “In da Club” rapper made headlines when critics body-shamed him after he performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar.
“50 cent got fat now he a dollar,” one troll tweeted via X (formerly Twitter).
A second added: “50 Cent out here looking like a FAT BAT.”
50 Cent took it all in stride, though. 
“I call this teasing me, They’re just teasing me because they know i can drop the weight. that’s why i laugh with them,” he reacted via Instagram after the big show. “Fat shaming only applies when your ashamed of your fat.”
Although 50 Cent claims he’s not on Ozempic, several other celebrities have revealed they have experimented with it, including Amy Schumer, Sharon Osbourne, Tracy Morgan and Housewives Heather Gay, Emily Simpson and Dolores Catania.
In December 2023, Oprah Winfrey told People she uses a weight-loss drug “as a tool to manage not yo-yoing,” but didn’t specific which one.
