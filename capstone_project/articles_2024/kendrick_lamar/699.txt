The Game has seen that Rick Ross did not issue a response on wax to his diss track, and the Compton rapper claimed that the former corrections officer was afraid to face off against him in the studio.
Taking to his Instagram Stories on Friday (May 10), and captured by The Shade Room, The Game alleged that Officer Ricky “chicken”ed out with his failure to respond to his diss track with bars of his own.

“He wanted all the smoke a week ago,” he wrote over a picture of a Louis Vuitton punching bag. “Chicken legs can’t go bar for bar so we going LV for LV now I guess.”
The “LV for LV” comment is in response to Ross’ video where he holds up a large Louis Vuitton-branded bowl and taunts, presumably in response to The Game’s diss, “You n-ggas must not want to eat.”

Though Ross and The Game have worked together in the past, most notably on “Ali Bomaye” from The Game’s Jesus Piece album, the Compton native appears to have an issue with Rozay’s relentless trolling of Drake in his feud with Kendrick Lamar and co.
Released on Friday (May 10), “Freeway’s Revenge” finds The Game throwing some flagrant shots at the MMG mogul regarding his alleged sexual kinks, weight and health issues, and past stint as a correctional officer.

“You 12 lemon pepper wings from a heart attack/ Akademiks, give this n-gga an Ozempic starter pack,” he raps, before referencing the aforementioned Drizzy-K.Dot beef: “This ain’t the Kendrick beef, my Drac’ sings songs/ Shots rings out, the neighbor better have his Ring on.”
The Game later accuses Ross of enjoying golden showers and claims former MMG rapper Gunplay knows where the proverbial bodies are buried: “Your baby mama told me that you liked to get peed on/ You a C.O., that’s the last time you had keys on/ And we know you treat Gunplay like he a peon/ And he knows some shit that ain’t cool for him to speak on.”

In response, the Biggest Bawse took to his Instagram on Friday (May 10) to quote a lyric from “Hate It Or Love It,” a song infamously recorded by 50 Cent and The Game back in 2005. (It should be noted, too, that neither Ross nor the Compton native is cool with the G-Unit boss.)
“Hate It or Love It The underdog on top,” he wrote in the caption — which was Fif’s line in the song — while also tagging the Rick Ross car show.
