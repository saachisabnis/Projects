50 Cent has apparently been keeping a list of those who insulted his physique during 2022’s Super Bowl Halftime Show — and he’s letting the culprits know he hasn’t forgotten the slander.
On Sunday (January 28), the G-Unit mogul took to Instagram to brag about his looks while rocking a white dinner jacket.

“I done turned into Mr let’s make a deal on these hoes. [shrugging man emoji] the fvck you gonna tell me now?” 50 Cent captioned his post. “Yall was calling me fat at the super bowl [confused face emoji] don’t think I forgot that shit! @bransoncognac @lecheminduroi.”
Instagram followers applauded his flex, with one user writing: “When the hate don’t work they start telling lies.” Another added: “Tell em we ain’t playing in 2024 bro! Let’s go.”
Check out the full post below:
Back in 2022, 50 Cent issued a belated response to those who called him “fat” during his surprise appearance at the Super Bowl Halftime show.
The “21 Questions” hitmaker shut down the criticism over his physique during a visit to 97.9 The Box in Houston, Texas, claiming the jokes about his so-called weight gain were greatly exaggerated.

“They said I was fat at the Super Bowl,” he said before standing up to show he’s more fit than fat. “I’m bigger than I was in the original [‘In Da Club’] video, but damn, I ain’t fat!”
Fif then joked: “After the Super Bowl, I’ve been hungry since, man. I’ve been hungry, I’ve been getting it off.”
The fat jokes were flying on social media throughout that Super Bowl Halftime Show — which also featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar. During the show, 50 performed his 2003 smash hit “In Da Club” while hanging upside down in a white tank top, just like in the song’s music video.

Surprisingly, 50 embraced the jokes on Instagram following his performance, posting a photo of D12 rapper Bizarre hanging upside down in the group’s 2004 “My Band” video, asking: “Who the fvck did this?” in the caption.
In other 50 Cent news, the Power co-creator and Dave Chappelle recently shared the stage at a fundraising event for Reggie Jackson’s Mr. October Foundation. During the event, Chappelle jokingly “auctioned off” the G-Unit mogul.

The legendary comedian compared the location, a Florida golf club, to a scene from the Jordan Peele film Get Out before joking that 50 was for sale to the largely white crowd.
“Mr. Jackson has transcended the odds of the Black community and came all the way out here to the Get Out resort,” he said to roars of laugher from the audience. “Surprise n-ggas, the auction begins right now! How much you want for this big buck?”
