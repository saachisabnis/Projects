Akademiks is furious at J. Cole for apologizing to Kendrick Lamar amid their rap beef, and he also claims that Drake has no plans of doing the same.
During his headlining set at Dreamville Festival on Sunday (April 7), the North Carolina native pulled out of his competitive spat with K.Dot just days after dropping the diss track “7 Minute Drill,” which was released as part of a surprise mixtape titled Might Delete Later.
Within minutes, Akademiks was on Twitter going off on the 39-year-old spitter.

“This N-gga J Cole just gave Kendrick Lamar a bye round in the Battle,” he wrote. “Kendrick Don’t even gotta drop another song.. Literally the N-gga u dissed… Tried to Diss u back and APOLOGIZED for even tryna disrespect u. WTF going on. We’ve never seen this in the history of rap.
“I knew J Cole wasn’t bout dat shit when He was getting Buttered up By Drake every night on stage for being #3 and he stay blushing accepting the runner up award for years before now claiming He’s the best. N-gga HE NEVER BELIEVED IT.”

He continued: “I aint gon lie… A NY rapper wouldn’t be apologizing for SHIT… neither a LA rapper..I dont know what J Cole on… the Carolinas aint looking good.
“J Cole really was never built to be #1 … he was always the Middle Child literally… Leave it to Drake and Kendrick to battle it out.”
Check out the full online rant below:
The following morning, the social-media personality went live on Rumble and revealed that he even sent a clip of the public apology to Drizzy and asked him not to back down like his peer.
“Drake laughs at me,” he told his viewers about the interaction. “He said, ‘I can’t fucking believe you would pull up and say some shit like that to me. You must not know me, n-gga.'”
During the closing night of his festival, Cole admitted that he had been feeling unsettled ever since he clapped back at his peer from Compton in response to his verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That,” which also includes jabs at the 6 God.
“I’m so proud of [Might Delete Later], except for one part,” the Fayetteville MC told the crowd. “It’s one part of that shit that makes me feel like, man that’s the lamest shit I did in my fuckin’ life, right? And I know this is not what a lot of people want to hear.

“I was conflicted because: one, I know my heart and I know how I feel about my peers. These two n-ggas that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone chase they greatness. So I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, bruh, I don’t even feel no way. But the world wanna see blood. I don’t know if y’all can feel that, but the world wanna see blood.”
He went on to praise Kendrick, saying: “That shit disrupts my fucking peace. So what I want to say right here tonight is in the midst of me doing that, trying to find a little angle and downplay this n-gga’s fucking catalog and his greatness, I want to say right now tonight, how many people think Kendrick Lamar is one of the greatest motherfuckers to ever touch a fucking microphone? Dreamville, y’all love Kendrick Lamar, correct? As do I.

“I just want to come up here and publicly be like, bruh, that was the lamest, goofiest shit. I say all that to say it made me feel like 10 years ago when I was moving incorrectly. And I pray that God will line me back up on my purpose and on my path. I pray that my n-gga really didn’t feel no way and if he did, my n-gga, I got my chin out. Take your best shot. I’ma take that shit on the chin, boy. Do what you do.
Cole concluded: “All good. It’s love. And I pray that y’all forgive a n-gga for the misstep and I can get back to my true path. Because I ain’t gonna lie to y’all, the past two days felt terrible. It let me know how good I’ve been sleeping for the past 10 years.”
