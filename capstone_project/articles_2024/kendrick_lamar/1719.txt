Chet Hanks, the son of Tom Hanks, shared screenshots on Instagram of his dad asking “can you explain the Drake/Kendrick Lamar feud to me?” Chet responded with a lengthy text summarizing the situation, including all of the songs and accusations involved. But the explanation presumably went over Tom’s head, as he quickly replied: “Holy cow! These are fighting words. People taking sides?? Who’s winning??” Chet then joked, “Did you not just read what I said?” The screenshots circulated on social media, with many praising Tom for his interest and considering his response to be very characteristic of him. His name soon became a trending topic as a result. (NBC)
