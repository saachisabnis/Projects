Apple Music recently released its “100 Best Albums” list, which notes some of the most groundbreaking and innovative albums of all time. With this, they also published an article with interviews from artists Nile Rogers and Maggie Rogers on these influential albums. Today, we’ll delve deeper into 10 standout tracks, one from each featured album, exploring what makes them resonate with listeners across generations.
“Lemonade” by Beyoncé kicks off Apple Music’s list in 10th place. While the entire album deserves to be celebrated and carefully studied, the song “Sorry” is arguably one of the most powerful in the album. This unflinching look at betrayal and resilience is a cornerstone of the album’s core. It showcases Beyoncé’s remarkable vocal range, emotional depth and beautiful writing abilities.
“Smells Like Teen Spirit” from Nirvana’s “Nevermind” is a cultural icon. This song’s raw energy and anthemic chorus perfectly capture the angst and rebellion of teenage life, solidifying its place in rock history and living up to its name. Many, even if they haven’t listened to Nirvana, know this song.
Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black” is epitomized by its title track. The song’s blend of soulful vocals and lyrics reflects the heartbreak and defiance at the heart of the album.
Ranking seventh on Apple’s list is Kendrick Lamar’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city.” This song delivers a powerful social commentary with the titular song “m.A.A.d city.” The track’s gritty storytelling and Lamar’s rapping flow paint a vivid picture of growing up amidst gang violence and poverty. It is innovative for not only its beat but also Lamar’s rapping. It’s no wonder that Lamar is considered one of the best rappers of this generation.
Nearing halfway on this list, Stevie Wonder’s “Songs in the Key of Life” boasts the timeless classic “Pastime Paradise.” This socially conscious masterpiece tackles themes of poverty and inequality, remaining relevant even decades after its release.
Frank Ocean’s Blonde is a beautiful album, well-loved by many. Like all the other albums on this list, it has many songs that are a must-listen. Frank Ocean has a very unique and innovative music style and “Ivy” perfectly embodies this. The song is hazy and beautiful; it tells the story of failed love, which is something anyone can relate to.
Prince has been an icon for decades. His album “Purple Rain” is synonymous with its title track. The song’s guitar work and vocals showcase Prince’s undeniable musical talent, making it an anthem for self-expression. Not just his, but anyone who listens to it.
As people who monumentally changed music for the rest of time, the Beatles obviously have many iconic and impactful songs, and “Abbey Road” features some of the most iconic. It’s nearly impossible to choose a top song on this album, but “Yellow Submarine” takes it for many. Not only is it a fun and upbeat song, but it has a nice meaning to it. This track exemplifies the band’s ability to blend catchy melodies with storytelling, ensuring its place as a pop culture favorite.
Michael Jackson is someone who impacted the music industry from the early age of 11. With so many iconic and life-changing songs throughout his career, “Thriller” from the album with the same name has changed the music industry for good. Its innovative blend of pop, rock and funk, along with Jackson’s immense talent as an artist, solidified the album as a global phenomenon. The short film for the song also changed how people made music videos, a trend that many copy even now 42 years later.
Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” finds its voice in the empowering “Ex-Factor.” This song’s soulful melody and honest lyrics address themes of heartbreak and self-worth, resonating with listeners seeking strength and independence. While other Lauryn Hill songs might have different strengths, “Ex-Factor” stands out for its raw honesty and message, along with Hill’s incredible voice. The song is well known by many for being among the greatest breakup songs ever written, which is huge. Hill is an incredible artist and certainly deserves first place among Apple Music’s Top 100 Albums.
