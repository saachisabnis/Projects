Drake has been accused of hiding a daughter from the public on Kendrick Lamar‘s latest diss track, and he has now shared a partial response.
On Friday (May 3), K.Dot released “meet the grahams” in response to his adversary’s “Family Matters.” On the joint, he claims that Drizzy has a daughter who he abandoned, while addressing her directly.

“Dear baby girl/ I’m sorry that your father not active inside your world/ He don’t commit to much but his music, yeah, that’s for sure/ He a narcissist, misogynist, livin’ inside his songs/ Try destroying families rather than takin’ care of his own/ Should be teachin’ you time tables or watchin’ ‘Frozen’ with you/ Or at your eleventh birthday, singin’ poems with you,” he raps.
While no evidence of this being true has been presented thus far, a number of fans have pointed to a 2012 tweet by the Canadian superstar that simply reads “Baby girl.” The reason this post is receiving a lot of attention is because its date matches his alleged daughter’s age as described in the Compton MC’s new song.

Other observers noted, however, that the tweet was posted on what would have been Aaliyah’s 33rd birthday, and Drizzy has long been a devoted fan of the late singer, whose nickname was “Baby Girl.”
The 6 God seems unfazed by the allegation, as he took to his Instagram Story soon after the cut went live and shared an image of himself looking unimpressed and bored.

Back in 2018, Drake was involved in a beef with Pusha T that prompted a similar claim about a son — a claim that turned out to be true.
The Toronto native had a child named Adonis with former French model Sophie Brussaux in late 2017, but this information remained concealed until the Clipse MC made it public on “Story Of Adidon” a year later.

“You are hiding a child, let that boy come home/ Deadbeat mothafucka playin’ border patrol, ooh/ Adonis is your son/ And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that’s real/ Love that baby, respect that girl/ Forget she’s a pornstar, let her be your world,” Push rapped on the track.
A month after the song went viral, the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker confirmed the rumor on his Scorpion LP.

“I had to come to terms with the fact that it’s not a maybe/ That shit is in stone, sealed and signed/ She not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine,” he admits on the B Side’s final song, “March 14.”
“Single father, I hate when I hear it/I used to challenge my parents on every album/ Now, I’m embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent/ Always promised a family unit/ I wanted it to be different because I’ve been through it/ But this is the harsh truth now.”

He also addresses his decision not to publicize the kid’s birth on the song “Emotionless” with the bars: “I wasn’t hiding my kid from the world/ I was hiding the world from my kid.”
