Ab-Soul has offered his thoughts on Drake and Kendrick Lamar‘s beef, claiming that Drizzy never had a chance against K. Dot in a rap battle.
The Top Dawg Entertainment rapper took to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (July 9) to weigh in on the rap titans’ rivalry now that the dust on their recent back-and-forth has settled.

Soul began by reciting lyrics from Kendrick’s “6:16 in LA” diss song, writing: “GOD… my confession is yours!!! But, who am I if I don’t go to War? There’s opportunity when livin wit loss. I discover myself when I fall short.”
He then said: “This was not a rap battle. It was scripture.”

After a series of cryptic tweets, the Carson, California native addressed Drake directly. Although he doesn’t believe he was ever a worthy opponent for Kendrick (lyrically speaking), Ab-Soul did back the 6 God to redeem himself after taking a beating in the battle.
“If Drake is the MC I imagine he can be. Redemption is not off the table,” he wrote, before adding: “Key word ‘MC.’

“But b4 my rant gets out of context. He could never Fucc wit da Gang’Nem on sum rap shyt. That was Never a question. We could still ‘potentially’ match ‘artistry’. (Removing my obvious personal/educated bias).”
Soul — who makes a cameo in the video for Kendrick’s hit diss song “Not Like Us” — concluded his sermon by writing: “If this is taken as an antic of any sort and not ISM. Well… get off if you mad then. Dead homies.
“PS: ‘Where the true artists at? If it ain’t a good picture you draw, don’t bring it to the architect.'”
“GOD… my confession is yours!!! But, who am I if I don’t go to War? There’s opportunity when livin wit loss. I discover myself when I fall short.”

Ab-Soul is far from the only rapper who has commented on the high-profile feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.
Earlier this month, LL Cool J claimed that the OVO Sound founder was not smart in choosing to clash with the Compton kingpin.

Speaking with Hot 97’s TT Torrez, LL — who was no stranger to rap beeds back in the day — was unequivocal in who he thought came out on top.
“Kendrick won the battle. I mean, come on. That’s obvious. That’s a no-brainer,” he said. “And listen, I like Drake. I love his music, he’s a cool dude. We don’t know each other but I like his music. I’m happy for him and everything.”

He added: “But, you know, Kendrick… that might have been a bad choice.”
Snoop Dogg, on the other hand, was more diplomatic in his assessment of the battle.

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight in May, Tha Doggfather praised bothh rappers for bringing lyricism back to the forefront.
“Well, the only thing I want to say about that whole scenario is that I want to give both of them a shout out for raising the bar as far as lyrics, as far as song-making and writing because the writing has been upped since the confrontation,” he said.

He added: “Those are my nephews. I’m not in the middle of it. I support both of them and that’s personal business, not my business.”
Snoop also said: “As far as what they did for the industry and the rap game, they made you rap again. You can’t mumble your way and gimmick your way to a song no more, buddy. So thank y’all.”
