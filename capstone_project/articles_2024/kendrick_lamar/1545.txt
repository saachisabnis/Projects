50 Cent is apparently taking a break from trolling his hip-hop rival Sean “Diddy” Combs to make yet another big money move — one that will net him a cool eight figures.
The Queens MC is joining the likes of many other beloved Black artists to have a Las Vegas residency, a list that most recently includes Usher, The Wu-Tang Clan, Lil Jon, and Snoop Dogg.
Fif shared his plans on his social media accounts: “My first Vegas residency is going to be an experience, you don’t wanna miss this! I’ll be doing 6 Exclusive shows December 27 - January 4 at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. Tickets on sale Saturday.”
Titled, “In Da Club,” the G-Unit boss isn’t doing this residency just for charity, he’ll be getting a nice paycheck for his services. According to TMZ, 50 Cent will be paid $15 million for the six-show residency, titled “In Da Club,” at the PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.
In a press release, 50 Cent expanded more on why he’s doing this Vegas residency now: “I always bring the energy, and Las Vegas is the perfect spot to create an unforgettable experience for my fans,” he wrote. “We’re talking big production, surprises, and the ultimate New Year’s Eve party for my Vegas residency.”
While Fif has been extremely active and successful in running his “Power” television series, he has still found times to entertain fans who love his music. In July 2023, he began “The Final Lap Tour” an international event that saw the Queens MC performing his classic hits in more than 103 cities across the world. 
According to Billboard, the tour, which ended March 2o24, became only the third rap tour in history to gross more than $100 million, joining the likes of Drake and Kendrick Lamar. So even though he’s not actively releasing music like he once did, it’s clear that fans are still hungry for performances from the “Many Men” emcee.
