The Exonerated Five, formerly known as the Central Park Five, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump following his controversial comments during last month’s presidential debate. According to NBC News, Trump falsely claimed during the debate, "They admitted — they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we’re not guilty." However, all five men had pleaded not guilty during their trials, and the victim in the case survived the attack. The lawsuit states that Trump's false and defamatory remarks have caused further harm to the Exonerated Five, who were cleared of all charges years ago.
