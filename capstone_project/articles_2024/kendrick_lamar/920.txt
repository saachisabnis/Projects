Following the July 4th premiere of the “Not Like Us” music video, Kendrick Lamar’s Drake-dissing track has jumped back up to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. “Not Like Us” debuted at No. 1 back on May 18, and has spent the past eight weeks fluctuating between No. 2-6 on the charts, jumping back up to the top spot after sitting at No. 3 over the past two weeks.  Morgan Wallen’s new single, “Lies Lies Lies,” debuts at No. 7, becoming the country star’s 10th song to reach the Top 10. Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” drops to No. 2 one week after it became his first ever No. 1 single. The rest of the Top 5 is rounded out by Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, which drops a spot to No. 3, Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” moves up a slot to No. 4, and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” slides a spot to No. 5.
