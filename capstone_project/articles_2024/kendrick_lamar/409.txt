Rap beefs are all the rage these days. While a very public feud between hip-hop artists Drake and Kendrick Lamar consumed popular culture the last week or so, former professional athletes-turned-TV-analysts are going at it in the proverbial music ring as well.
Or, at least one of them is. Shaquille O'Neal dropped a diss track of sorts against Shannon Sharpe on Friday that awaits a response from Sharpe. 
The company that produces Shaquille O'Neal's The Big Podcast With Shaq Tweeted out the diss. Sharpe took the first "shot" when he suggested that O'Neal is jealous of Nikola Jokic and other modern centers in the NBA, presumably because he thinks O'Neal is worried they'll detract from his own legacy as an NBA legend.

Sharpe's jab was in response to O'Neal telling Jokicâ€”on live TVâ€”that he doesn't think he deserved to win his third MVP. 
Shaq's track opens with an audio excerpt of Sharpe, directly alerting listeners to what he's replying to. 
Did the world need this? Absolutely not. But on an otherwise calm sports news Friday, why not? 
O'Neal has enjoyed a career in pop culture aside from his athletic career. Not only does he currently work as an NBA analyst on TNT, but he also starred in Kazaam and Steel and cameod in other films like Scary Movie 4 and The Lego Movie. This isn't his first foray into music, as he released five studio albums, the first in 1993 and the most recent in 2023. He also created the soundtrack album for Steel. He also DJs events around the world on occasion as "DJ DIESEL". A real renaissance man. 
As for whether or not Sharpe plans to respond with a track of his own, we can only hope.
