In many ways, it feels as if Top Dawg Entertainment is beginning the next chapter of its story.
Within the last four years, SZA has released her most commercially successful album yet while Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q and SiR have all put out critically-acclaimed projects and toured. Meanwhile, Reason and Kendrick Lamar have both departed to pursue solo endeavors.
In the midst of these releases and departures, the label has added two new acts, Doechii and Ray Vaughn. Each artist has made waves and slowly built up their fan base. Now, it looks like the label is ready to kickstart its next era with the Swamp Pricness leading the way.
On her 26th birthday, Doechii announced the release of her second project under the TDE banner, Alligator Bites Never Heal. The new project from the Florida native will hit streaming services on Friday, August 30.
Doechii hasn’t shared a track list or unveiled a star-studded list of features, but she has gained momentum with the release of her Swamp Session freestyles. Ranging from 65-seconds to nearly four minutes, each release showcases a different tool in her toolbelt. From singing to rapping, Doechii is everything Top Dawg Entertainment said she was when signed with the label a few years ago. Now, the world will have the opportunity to see and her talent when Alligator Bites Never Heal drops on Friday, August 30.
