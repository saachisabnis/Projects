After years of tension building between rap superstars Drake and Kendrick Lamar, the two have finally engaged in a public rap battle after releasing diss songs against each other. One of the earlier moments of their feud dates back over a decade ago when many felt Kendrick took shots at Drake during his 2013 BET Cypher verse when he rapped, "Nothing's been the same since they dropped 'Control'/ And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes/ Ha ha joke's on you, high-fiveâ€¦ I'm bulletproof/ Your shoots never penetrates/ Pin the tail on the donkey, boy you been a fake." Shortly after the viral moment, VladTV caught up with Kendrick's TDE lablemate, Schoolboy Q, who tried to avoid the topic but pointed out that the verse had been done a while before the public heard it.
