Chuck D has begged Kendrick Lamar to get the old band back together — in this case, Black Hippy — because he’s aching for some new, good Hip Hop for his playlist.
Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday (May 12), the Public Enemy legend said that he loves everything about the rap supergroup and couldn’t wait to hear what they have in store next.

The “Bring The Noise” rapper, though, is going to have to wait a long time for a new Black Hippy album, as ScHoolboy Q recently said that he doesn’t see a new Black Hippy album ever happening.
The flagship TDE artist appeared on an episode of The Danny Brown Show that went live on April 12, during which he was asked if he still doesn’t see himself reuniting with his fellow Black Hippy compatriots.

“I’m not making no Black Hippy shit,” he said. “Hell no. I’ll never do that shit. ”
When Brown pressed, asking if he would consider doing it “for the culture,” Q snapped back: “Fuck the culture. Ain’t no culture. What is the culture? What is rap culture? What is the fucking rap culture?”

On a more serious note, he continued: “I think we’re all kind of on our separate paths right now. Dot is doing his own thing with pgLang. I’m doing my own thing, curating a new artist. I did that part already, I gotta have this second part ’cause I got like 18 more albums to make.
“So it’s like I’m tryna figure out this phase before I get to the third phase. And Ab-Soul, he’s working, Jay Rock‘s working. I just don’t see where we’ll ever have time to.”

This is far from the first time that Schoolboy Q has said that fans would never get a Black Hippy reunion album.
Back in 2017, during an appearance on Ab-Soul’s YMF tour, he mentioned his album was next “by any means” following the release of SZA’s debut CTRL.

However, while speaking with Montreality, he talked about plans for his follow-up to 2016’s Blank Face LP and why his fans shouldn’t count on a Black Hippy project anytime soon.
“I’m already working on my next album,” Q said. “The chances of us getting into the studio together and working on Black Hippy is slim. There’s too much going on … I’m with it though. I wanna do it.”
