Elliott Wilson seems to have rubbed Drake‘s supporters the wrong way as he now claims that his stance on the Canadian superstar’s beef with Kendrick Lamar has landed him in trouble.
The veteran journalist, who is the editorial director of Hip Hop Journalism at UPROXX Studios (HipHopDX‘s parent company), was recently unfollowed by Drizzy on Instagram after he declared that K.Dot emerged victorious in the high-profile feud.

“It’s funny ’cause Drake’s the kind of dude that even if he don’t fuck with you, he still follows you,” Wilson said during an episode of The Bigger Picture that went live on Tuesday (May 21). “He’s not an unfollow kind of dude.
“At the end of the day, Kendrick clearly won,” he continued. “I got the calls from OGs. You know, I’m not really welcome in Toronto right now […] I grew up in New York City — you know you don’t go through other people’s project, right?

He concluded: “I would not go to Toronto if me and Drake weren’t good, so that obviously makes sense. So yeah, I just think it’s a tough time.”

The 6 God got into it with Wilson last year after the latter criticized him for shunning rap media in favor of “outsiders.”
In mid-2023, the former XXL editor-in-chief called out Drake for snubbing Hip Hop media after he sat down for off-beat interviews with Barstool Sports‘ Caleb Pressley and TikTok star Bobbi Althoff.

“Moment of clarity: No disrespect to Lil Boat,” he wrote in a since-deleted tweet. “Yachty’s convo with The Boy was comfy and had some cool moments. I was more so clowning the comedy shenanigans with outsiders to our culture. It would be great to hear Drake speak to us again. Even if it ain’t me.”
After Akademiks shared a social-media clip of the journalist interviewing Trippie Redd at Rolling Loud Miami the following week, the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker jumped in the comments section to throw some shade.

“Lol man shits on not coming to his platform for a second time and now Elliott 10 toes doing Yes Julz run up interviews at Rolling Loud,” he wrote along with laughing emojis. “Just admit the youth took over big dog.”
In response, the reporter shared a screenshot of the comment on X (formerly Twitter) and wrote: “Oh, it’s go time? Cool.”
