Speaking about Kendrick’s feud with Drake, Oschino said: “First of all, Drake got a whole country behind him. Drake got the most hits. Girls like Drake.
“Kendrick can rap too but I think he overrated, though. All of his songs are not hot to me. When Drake sings, I hate it. When Drake sings, I cut it off. I say, ‘Drake, don’t do this.’

“When Kendrick Lamar sings on some of his songs, he tries to go too deep, I’m like…,” he continued, pulling an unimpressed face.
“People like something they don’t understand a little bit. You need to be saying some crazy double entendres sometimes but Kendrick Lamar got a lot of songs I don’t like. Lyrics? He hot. But some of the songs, they ain’t for me.”
Despite being deemed by many as the winner in his beef with Drake, Kendrick Lamar has also been criticized by cultural critic Michael Eric Dyson — but for very different reasons.
Dyson took issue with the way that K. Dot made Drake’s racial identity a central part of the rap battle.

Speaking with Stephen A. Smith over the weekend, he said: “Challenging his racial identity and saying he’s a culture vulture when he’s a Black man? ‘He’s from Canada, he ain’t real!’ Idris Elba is from the UK; people still love him on The Wire! So why is it that being from outside of our nationality raises suspicions about Drake.”
He continued: “Kendrick Lamar is a brilliant rapper and a formidable foe. But so is Drake. And what he’s done to expand the horizon of Hip Hop is underestimated, even artistically […] We have to stop this narrow, punishing, pernicious, limited viewpoint about Blackness.”
