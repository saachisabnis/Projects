Seven years since his last appearance, MC Eiht returned for another VladTV exclusive. The West Coast rap legend started by offering his thoughts on Kendrick Lamar's rap feud with Drake and the Compton star's "Pop Out" concert. The conversation transitioned to rap beefs that turned violent during MC Eiht's era before addressing the impact of his Compton peers, such as NWA and DJ Quik. MC Eiht also criticized Keefe D for implicating himself in 2Pac's passing, the theories surrounding Biggie Smalls' death, and the intimidation tactics Suge Knight would use. Throughout the rest of the interview, MC Eiht talked about Diddy's legal issues, No Jumper's interview with Blockstar, Foolio, and much more.
