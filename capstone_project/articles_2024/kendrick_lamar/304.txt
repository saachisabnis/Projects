Last month, Drake filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) regarding Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us." In his initial court filing, he claims that UMG and Spotify used bots and payola to boost the song's popularity unfairly. He also accuses UMG of defamation, stating they could have stopped the release of the track where Kendrick calls him a sexual predator. The filing says that UMG did not rely on normal practices but instead tried to manipulate streaming services and radio. A hearing is set for December 20, according to Kurrco. The outcome of this case is uncertain, but social media is buzzing with opinions. Reactions have been mixed since news of the petition broke. Some believe Drake might expose corruption in the music industry, while others think he seems envious of Kendrick's achievements. During a recent episode of his Apple Music show, Ebro expressed his view that Drake might lose. He shared his experience in the radio industry and noted that investigations into payola have never led to significant changes. Conversely, Funkmaster Flex supports Drake's stance, stating that he is absolutely correct and pointing out the high costs artists face for airplay, which he believes hinders independent artists from succeeding.
