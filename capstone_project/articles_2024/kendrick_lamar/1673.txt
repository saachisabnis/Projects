Soulja Boy expressed his discontent with Drake following the highly publicized feud with Kendrick Lamar. The feud between Drake and Lamar began after Lamar's verse on Big Sean's "Control" in 2013. In 2023, Drake and J. Cole collaborated on the popular track "First Person Shooter" from Drake's album "For All The Dogs." Lamar addressed the idea of a hip-hop Big 3 on the Future & Metro Boomin track "Like That." Soulja Boy, gearing up for a new album release on July 28, voiced his disappointment with Drake on X (formerly Twitter), sparking mixed reactions. While some felt Drake deserved the criticism, others accused Soulja Boy of seeking attention, noting that controversy often boosts album sales. Drake and Soulja Boy had a congenial relationship during Drake's early career peak, highlighted by Drake freestyling over "We Made It" in 2013. In 2019, Soulja Boy claimed to have taught Drake everything he knows, leading to a brief feud and subsequent reconciliation initiated by Drake. 
Since the clash with Kendrick Lamar, Drake has been struggling and reportedly plans to drop new music this summer to regain ground. Lamar has been enjoying a successful run, with "Not Like Us" hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 after its music video release. Soulja Boy isn't the only rapper disappointed with Drake; Ab-Soul, Lamar's Black Hippy group mate, also hinted at disappointment but left room for potential reconciliation. However, he made it clear that Drake could never match Kendrick's prowess in the rap scene.
