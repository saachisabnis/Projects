DJ Mustard recently revealed Kendrick Lamar’s thoughts on the beat for “Not Like Us,” in a recent interview with Billboard. The Los Angeles native mentioned that he realized the track was special while working on it in April. “I started chopping it up and I sped it up and I did the drums… [Then] I sent him the beat and [later headed to] my manager’s birthday party,” DJ Mustard recalls. He says that after he sent it, Kendrick replied later that night, “This is fire.” 
Following the track’s release in early May, it took over social media and found great success on the charts. The song is even rumored to be eligible for a Grammy nomination. DJ Mustard says he didn’t understand the impact of the song at first. “I don’t think I even understood how big it was until it went No. 1 (on the Billboard Hot 100)… ‘This is the biggest song I ever had in my life.’ I just wanted a song with Kendrick.”

Currently, DJ Mustard is preparing to drop his upcoming project, Faith of a Mustard Seed. The album will be dropping on July 26. While the tracklist isn’t out yet, he dropped off a single featuring Travis Scott titled “Parking Lot.” The producer says the project’s title comes from the late Nipsey Hussle. Another Los Angeles native, Hussle was gunned down in March 2019 outside his Marathon clothing store.
His death had a profound effect on the city of Los Angeles, leading to an outpouring from fans and artists alike. “When I was doing Perfect Ten, I remember the last conversation I had with Nipsey, he was telling me to name that album Faith of a Mustard Seed.” He continued: “We talked for hours that night and I always kept that in the back of my head.”
