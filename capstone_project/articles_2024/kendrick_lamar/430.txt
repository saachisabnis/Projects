After days of fans arguing why Lil Wayne should’ve been chosen as the headliner for the Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans over Kendrick Lamar, the man himself has spoken out.
Late Thursday night, Weezy took to Instagram Live to speak directly to his fans and express his true and honest feelings over not being able to perform in his hometown during the biggest sports event of the year.
Sounding calm and relaxed, Wayne stated, “That hurt. It hurt a lot… I blame myself for not being mentally prepared for a letdown and for just automatically mentally putting myself in that position like someone told me that was my position. So I blame myself for that. I thought there was nothing better than that spot and that stage and that platform in my city. So it hurt. It hurt a lot.”
Despite his disappointment, Wayne expressed his gratitude toward his loyal fans, close friends and peers: “But ya’ll… Ya’ll are f***ing amazing. It made me feel like s**t not getting this opportunity. And when I felt like s**t you guys reminded me that I ain’t s**t without ya’ll. That’s an amazing reality.” 
He continued, “Like I said, It broke me and I’m just trying to put me back together. But my god have you all helped me. Thanks to all my peers, my friends, my family, my homies on sports television and everybody repping me I really appreciate that. I feel like I let all of ya’ll down by not getting that opportunity.”
Despite Wayne’s disappointed demeanor and the outpour of support from fans on social media, many were not buying his emotional state, with some claiming that he was corny and playing the victim in the video. 
Even though it’s not totally sealed that Wayne won’t make an appearance at the Super Bowl Halftime stage, as Kendrick and his team could bring him out for a guest appearance, it’s unlikely since Kendrick was just embroiled in the beef of the century with Wayne’s protege, Drake.
While many blame Kendrick for stealing Wayne’s spotlight, many have aimed their anger toward Jay-Z and Roc Nation, since they have assisted in picking the Super Bowl Halftime Show performers since 2019. But many have also come to Hov’s defense, including Jay Electronica and Big Pun, who smartly stated that if there was no Jay-Z, there would be no hip-hop at the Super Bowl.
