	Solana season appears to be on the horizon. After promising a pair of albums, SZA has teased the deluxe edition of her record-breaking SOS album.

	The Grammy-winning singer posted a photo to her Instagram Story on Friday (Dec. 6) featuring a whiteboard that appeared to have a tracklist for the upcoming deluxe, but SZA made sure to cover up most of the potential song names.

	“Do not erase. Deluxe,” the board is titled with every track blurred out except for “Saturn.” SZA looks ready to protect Gotham as she’s rocking a Spider-Man suit in the studio. 

	“SHE GOT BACK IN THE STUDIO,” an excited fan replied on X.

	In November, SZA revealed she had plans to release two albums, one being the SOS deluxe and the other being her anticipated Lana project.

	“I think I am making music from a more beautiful place. From a more possible place versus a more angsty place,” she told British Vogue. “I’m not identifying with my brokenness. It’s not my identity. It’s s–t that happened to me. Yeah, I experienced cruelty. I have to put it down at some point. Piece by piece, my music is shifting because of that, the lighter I get.”

SOS arrived in December 2022 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 318,000 equivalent album units – the third-highest debut week of the year. The album went on to sped 10 total weeks atop the chart.

	SZA will be hitting the road in 2025 as part of Kendrick Lamar’s Grand National Tour, which will be invading stadiums across North America next summer.
