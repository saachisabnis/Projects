Oakley founder James Jannard sold his Malibu mansion for $210 million, breaking the record for highest home sale price ever in California.
MALIBU, Calif. - The founder of Oakley has just sold his Malibu mansion in a transaction that's being touted as the most expensive real estate sale in California history.
James Jannard's former megamansion was sold to a private buyer for a cool $210 million - quite the profit from when Jannard purchased the home in 2012 for $75 million, The Los Angeles Times reports. 
This surpasses the sale of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's $200 million Malibu mansion last year.

The home includes 8 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, a gym, two guesthouses, a pool, tennis court, and a courtyard just to name a few of the amenities.
Michael S. Smith, the designer who remodeled the Oval Office in the White House, was the mansion's interior designer. The listing was held by Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency.

Jannard's estimated net worth is $1.3 billion, according to Forbes.
