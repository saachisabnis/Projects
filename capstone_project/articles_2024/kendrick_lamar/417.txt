Charli XCX and Post Malone already had tons of nominations going into the 2025 Grammys, but they both just picked up one more each.
Billboard reports that the two artists are now nominated for Best Recording Package for their albums Brat and F-1 Trillion. The albums were already nominated, but at first, neither Charli nor Posty were listed as art directors on their projects. Since then, those credits have been updated and resubmitted, so now they each score an extra nod in that category, giving them eight apiece.
As a result, Charli and Posty are tied as the second most-nominated artists this year, behind Beyoncé, who has 11 nods. They’ve pulled ahead of Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar, who have seven each.
Billboard notes that artists are becoming more involved in the art direction of their albums. Among the musicians who’ve won Grammys in the Best Recording Package category for art directing or co-directing their albums over the years: Frank Sinatra, Joni Mitchell, Pearl Jam‘s Jeff Ament, Tool‘s Adam Jones, Father John Misty and Suzanne Vega.
