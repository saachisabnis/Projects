New data reveals the top 100 tunes to add to your playlist to beat January blues
With the January blues hitting hard for many Americans, a new study has revealed the country's most favored song choices if they want to put themselves in a good mood - and Vance Joy’s Riptide tops the list.
The research, conducted by Bonus Ninja, used Spotify’s Playlist Miner tool to determine the top songs included in ‘feel-good’ related playlists, to identify the music that the US listen to when they want to brighten their day. 
It's normal to feel a lull in energy levels in the New Year, as everyone settles back into their day-to-day routines without the buzz created by all the celebrations during the holiday season - and with significantly emptier bank accounts.
However, the right music can help overcome this and leave you feeling happy instead, as it is proven to trigger the release of dopamine.
The study reveals 100 of the most popular hits that Americans listen to when they want to put this into action, which - if they aren't already - deserve a spot on your playlist.
