Kendrick Lamar has several bangers on his recently released surprise album, “GNX.” But the first track to get the music video treatment is “squabble up,” a track he previewed on the “Not Like Us” video. 
Naturally, the track is filled with fun and interesting references to Lamar’s hometown and other things in Black culture. Here at The Root, we’ll list some of our favorite references in the video. 
The set of Lamar’s video closely resembles the set that The Roots used for the music video of their 1999 track, “The Next Movement.”
If you’re a fan of 1980s West Coast hip-hop, this reference may have put a smile on your face. Notice the lady on the right holding a shotgun? That’s a direct reference to the cover of Ice-T’s 1988 album, “Power.” Lamar also references Radio Raheem, a character from Spike Lee’s 1989 film, “Do the Right Thing.” Although, in the film, Raheem’s 4-finger rings read, “HATE LOVE.” In the music video, they read, “HOOD LOVE.”
This reference may have gone over the heads of hip-hop fans who never saw the 1993 film, “Menace II Society.” In the final scene of the film, Caine protects Anthony, the young boy, during a drive-by shooting. 
It’s always dope to see Kendrick pay homage to West Coast legends. Nate Dogg is one of the founding fathers of G-Funk and Lamar references his 1998 studio album, “G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1 & 2.”
This is a throwback for people who have been listening to music for more than 50 years. The man standing resembles Isaac Hayes on the cover of his 1971 album, “Black Moses.”
The poster Lamar is holding up is a reference to an outreach ministry based in Los Angeles that focuses on outreach to people involved in gang culture. K. Dot also featured the scrabble board that was a staple on the show “Soul Train.” 
Kendrick is always putting on for his city. In this instance, he essentially giving the Compton Christmas Parade free promo here. It’ll be awesome if he shows up for a surprise performance.
