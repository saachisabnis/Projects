Gillie Da Kid is unimpressed by Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole‘s recent battle, describing it as “corny” compared to some of Hip Hop’s most famous feuds.
Appearing on Shaquille O’Neal’s The Big Podcast With Shaq, the Million Dollaz Worth of Game shared his honest thoughts on the lyrical exchange between K. Dot and Cole — and he didn’t pull any punches.

“J [Cole] is my guy, great dude. [But] it was a total [bitch] move, bro,” Gillie said of the latter’s divisive apology after dissing Kendrick on wax.
“First of all, let’s just be honest: that’s not no diss record. ‘Fuck the big three, it’s just big me,’” he continued, referencing K. Dot’s shots on Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That.” “If that’s a diss record, that’s corny.”

“The last time I checked, diss records went like this: ‘First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim/ Westside when we ride, come equipped with game/ You claim to be a playa but I fucked your wife/ We bust on Bad Boy n-ggas, fucked for life.’”
After quoting 2Pac‘s “Hit ‘Em Up,” Gillie then cited a few lines from another classic diss song, Nas‘ “Ether.”

“‘You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a stan/ I still whip yo ass, you 36 in a karate class/ You Tae-bo hoe, trying to work it out, you tryna’ get brolic?/ Ask me if I’m trying to kick knowledge.’
“Those was diss records. Not no, ‘Fuck the big three, it’s just big me.’ What? And then even J. Cole’s response. ‘Your first album was hot, your second album wasn’t/ Your third album they gassed it.’

“What is we talking about, man?! Diss records used to be like, ‘Fuck you, buddy. You can’t fuck with me.'”

The drama began when Kendrick Lamar went after Drake and J. Cole in in his blistering verse on “Like That”, from Future and Metro’s joint album We Don’t Trust You.

Referencing the pair’s hit single “First Person Shooter,” K. Dot rapped: “Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches.”
He also attempted to settle the “big three” debate surrounding them and spun Drizzy’s For All the Dogs LP into a menacing bar.

“Motherfuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum/ What? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack’/ N-gga, bum/ ‘Fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary,” he added.
J. Cole responded shortly after with “7 Minute Drill,” featured on his early April surprise project Might Delete Later.

Taking aim at the perceived quality of his friend-turned-foe’s catalog, he rapped: “Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic/ Your second shit put n-ggas to sleep, but they gassed it/ Your third shit was massive and that was your prime/ I was trailin’ right behind and I just now hit mine.”
Just a few days later, the Dreamville boss publicly apologized to Kendrick while performing at Dreamville Festival — much to the disapproval of many in Hip Hop.

“I’m so proud of [Might Delete Later], except for one part. It’s one part of that shit that makes me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I did in my fuckin’ life, right? And I know this is not what a lot of people want to hear,” he told the crowd.
“I was conflicted because: one, I know my heart and I know how I feel about my peers. These two n-ggas that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone chase they greatness. So I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, bruh, I don’t even feel no way. But the world wanna see blood.”

He added: “I pray that my n-gga really didn’t feel no way and if he did, my n-gga, I got my chin out. Take your best shot. I’ma take that shit on the chin, boy. Do what you do.
“And I pray that y’all forgive a n-gga for the misstep and I can get back to my true path. Because I ain’t gonna lie to y’all, the past two days felt terrible. It let me know how good I’ve been sleeping for the past 10 years.”
