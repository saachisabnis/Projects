During an NXT Digital Exclusive, Shayna Baszler spoke about choking out Lola Vice on last night’s episode and their upcoming Underground match at NXT Battleground. Baszler also posted to Instagram to take shots at Vice, quoting Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Meet the Grahams’. 
She said: “What just happened is, I just came alive out there. See, Lola thinks she entered NXT Underground one day and became a badass. But that’s where I came up, and she’s about to learn a lesson in the only way you can learn. I can’t wait.”
Meanwhile, the lyrics from the Lamar track included: “Even if it don’t benefit your goals, do some push ups, get some discipline / Don’t cut them corners like your daddy did, f*ck what Ozempic did.”
