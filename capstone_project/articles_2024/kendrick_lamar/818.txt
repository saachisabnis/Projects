AMARILLO'S #1 HIT MUSIC STATION
Ye goes in on J. ColeÂ and Drake the remix of Future and Metro Boomin's song "Like That." The G.O.O.D. Music leader also disses Cole on Instagram.
On Saturday (April 20), Ye appeared on Justin Laboy's podcast The Download and premiered his verse on the remix of Future and Metro Boomin's track "Like That." The full episode of the show is not out yet. On the song, the Grammy-winning rapper-producer takes aim at J. Cole for being soft and also downplays Drake by claiming he can't recite a lyric from the Toronto rhymer.
"It's a rap for n***as/Where's Lucian? Serve your master, n***a/You caught a little bag for your masters, didn't ya?/Lifetime deal, I feel bad for n***as/Y'all so outta sight, outta mind/I can't even think of a Drake line/Play J. Cole, get the p***y dry/Play this s**t back a hundred-thirty times," Ye raps on the song.
Additionally, Ye shared an image of an illustration depicting a man and a woman on his Instagram. In the artwork, which can be viewed below, the man informs the woman that he does not listen to J. Cole's music, which leads the woman to perform a sex act on him.
The "Like That (Remix)" has since been uploaded to YouTube. The new version is sans K-Dot but features a new verse from Future.
Ye's appearance on the "Like That (Remix)" follows the original track debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on April 1. The initial tune, which features Kendrick Lamar taking shots at Drake and J. Cole, appears on Future and Young Metro joint project, We Don't Trust You.
