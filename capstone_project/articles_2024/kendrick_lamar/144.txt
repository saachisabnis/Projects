Drake surprised everyone by dropping three new tracks: “Circadian Rhythm,” “SOD,” and “No Face” featuring Playboi Carti on his Instagram burner account @plottttwistttttt. Fans might recognize “SOD” as the track “Supersoak,” which streamer Kai Cenat previewed last month, originally featuring Lil Yachty. Even before its official release, it stirred up drama when Yachty tried to clear a sample from Mr. HotSpot, only to be denied unless the song was cleaned up per HotSpot’s religious beliefs.
Now, for the official release, Yachty has been entirely cut from the track. Some fans have been speculating that tensions might have been brewing between Yachty and Drake after noticing that Yachty unfollowed Drake on Instagram recently.
As for “Circadian Rhythm,” anyone keeping tabs on the ongoing beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar might catch a connection to Lamar’s diss track “6:16 in LA.” There’s already chatter that Drake might’ve drawn inspiration from a line in “6:16 in LA,” where Lamar raps, “Often, I know this type of power is gon’ cost / But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star.”
On Sunday, Drake hinted that he’s ready to come back strong with Game 2, sharing a cryptic post on his account featuring a legendary 2004 interview with Detroit Pistons star Rasheed Wallace saying, “Y'all put it on the front page, back page, middle of the page… we will win Game 2.” He also posted a still from the 1986 film A Better Tomorrow.
In “No Face,” Drake broadens his aim, taking shots at anyone who’s spoken against him, rapping, “I’m just so happy that n—s who envied and held that sh-t in got to finally show it / I’m over the moon, yeah, we’ll see you boys soon.”
These tracks dropped just weeks after Drake released a treasure trove of unreleased music, behind-the-scenes footage, tour set designs, and studio clips on 100gigs.org. That folder also included another trio of songs—“It’s Up” featuring Young Thug and 21 Savage, “Blue Green Red,” and “Housekeeping Knows” featuring Latto that he teased on his IG burner before officially releasing them to DSPs a few days later.
Fans flocked to Reddit to share their thoughts on Drake’s latest drops, with many impressed. One person commented, “He hits so many genres and sounds that it never gets old.” Another chimed in, “Drizzy really is a student of Wayne,” nodding to his connection with Lil Wayne.
