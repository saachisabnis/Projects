Drake tackles the rumor about his alleged affinity for cosmetic surgery on his new collaboration with Sexyy Red. On Friday, May 23, Big Sexyy dropped her latest song with The Boy "U My Everything" from her new project In Sexyy We Trust executive produced by Tay Keith. On the song, Drake takes his final jabs at his haters when he dreams of his favorite vacation spots. "Maybe we go to Saint Lucia, I been there, so Iâ€™ll introduce you/Or maybe you go to Saint Martin with me if these n***as take break and quit startin' with me," Drizzy raps.

From there, the instrumental switches up and segues into a slower rendition of Metro Boomin's "BBL Drizzy" beat, which was inspired by Rick Ross' viral phrase following his diss track "Champagne Moments." The Toronto native took the opportunity to address rumors that allege he got plastic surgery. He admits he does have a history with a Texas-based cosmetic surgeon Dr. Calvin Jung. However, he said that all he does is send Jung clients. Despite helping other women enhance their assets, Drake tells Sexyy to remain all natural. "Me and the surgeon got history," Drake spits. "I changed a lot of girls' lives for real/They need a new body, they hittin' me/BBL Drizzy, they want a new body, they ask me for it/The last one, Jung, he did it for free 'cause I sent over so many past ones for him/But Red, don't even worry about all of that s**t/Just keep it natural for 'em, I swear." "U My Everything" is the first song Drake has appeared on since he and Kendrick Lamar ended their weeks-long feud. Following Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us," Drizzy responded to allegations of pedophilia and snitches within his OVO crew on "The Heart Part 6." He denounced all accusations about him grooming young girls and claimed he fed Kendrick's team false information about him. Listen to the song above and stream Sexyy Red's new project in full below.
