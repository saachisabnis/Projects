Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem delivered an unforgettable performance together in the UK for the first time in 30 years. The dynamic West Coast duo threw a massive party in London on Thursday night, July 18, in celebration of the launch of their ready-to-drink cocktail Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop. Later on, host Shaquille O'Neal called the Aftermath founder and the Death Row Records owner to the stage where they performed "Deep Cover" and "Aint Nothin But a G Thang" together. Snoop continued the show with "Drop It Like It's Hot" and "Ain't No Fun" before Eminem made a surprise appearance. 
The Detroit native kicked off his set by performing his latest single "Houdini" from The Death Of Slim Shady (Coup De Gr√¢ce). Afterward, Em and his mentor shocked the crowd by performing "Forgot About Dre." Snoop returned to the stage to perform "What's My Name" and "Next Episode." It was the first time all three artists had shared a stage since the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show featuring Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson. Paak. It was also the first time they've performed together in the UK in three decades. Dre and Snoop's shindig had numerous celebrity attendees in the crowd during their performance including their friends Jimmy Iovine, LeBron James and Rich Paul. Fellow rapper Offset was also spotted at the party along with actors like Jeremy Renner, Dominic West, Anya Taylor-Joy, Idris Elba, Sabrina Elba and more. Eminem was also in London to meet some fans and signed autographs at an exclusive pop-up in honor of his 12th studio album. The collaborative event with Complex featured an open casket full of roses with capsule collections with hoodies, t-shirts, hats, and special vinyl records.
