Ice Spice's Y2K! got a higher Pitchfork rating than a bunch of critically acclaimed hip-hop albums and it blows our minds.
The internet is in an uproar over Pitchfork's review of Ice Spice's Y2K! album, which the music review blog gave a 7.6 out of 10. On Monday (July 29), the publication shared a detailed review of Y2K!, which many fans criticized on its first listen when the album dropped on Friday (July 26). Pitchfork gave the project the highest rating of a female rapper this year. Y2K! was also one of the publication's highest-reviewed rap albums in general, with ScHoolboy Q's Blue Lips being the only album to beat it out with a rating of 8.3.
Similarly, Pitchfork rated Ice Spice's debut EP Like...? a 7.6 in 2023, which was higher than Drake and 21 Savage's album, Her Loss, Future's I Never Liked You and Lil Baby's It's Only Me. All of those albums were praised for being some of 2022's best rap albums.
Overall, it seems Pitchfork has a real affinity for Ice Spice, more so than a lot of legendary rappers. For example, Y2K! was given the same score as Kendrick Lamar's Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, which is just blowing our minds.
