SiR and D Smoke are mourning the loss of their mother, who has died from complications following a car accident earlier this year.
Taking to Instagram on Sunday (August 12), the Rhythm + Flow winner confirmed Jackie Gouché Farris had passed on.

“Today, at 9:19am our beautiful mother passed due to complications related to a car accident that took place on March 31st 2024, Easter,” he said. “As we process the immense heartache of loss, we’re careful to give thanks for having lived so close to one of the greatest souls to walk the face of this earth. She was our mother, music teacher, mentor in the home role model, biggest fan and friend.
“We are grateful to everyone who showed up, brought food, spent time, called, gave plants, gave flowers ran errands and prayed for us during these past couple months. Our mother is no longer suffering and if you know her, you know where she’s at. We will keep y’all posted on how best to support us in this time. Thank you all for the love and just know when you see us, you see Jackie Gouché Farris, the greatest.

“P.S. Please respect our privacy at this difficult time. If we don’t get back to you immediately, please understand.”
SiR also shared some words days earlier, writing on X, “Hold your loved ones tight while you have the chance. You never know.”

SiR last made headlines on a much happier occasion — when ScHoolboy Q made some lighthearted jokes at his expense following a cancelation of a gig in Toronto.
On July 30, SiR took to X to let fans know that his scheduled stop at club History in the Canadian city would no longer be happening.

“So sorry to my Toronto fans. The show has been cancelled. We’re working on rescheduling for a later date,” he wrote.
With a retweet, Q – whose Toronto show at the same venue was also cancelled at the last minute in June – wrote, “HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAA TAKE YO ASS HOME BOY.. SING ON THE BUS ITS OVA WIT.”

History in Toronto is a venue “brought to you by Live Nation, in collaboration with Drake,” so some are wondering if the OVO rapper may have blocked the TDE artists due to their affiliation with Kendrick Lamar.
