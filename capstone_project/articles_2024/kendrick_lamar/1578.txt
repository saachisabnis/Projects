Rick Ross isn’t sweating the scuffle he was engaged in after a recent show in Vancouver. Hitting Instagram, Rozay smiled and delivered an explanation.
“I’m thinking about the event that happened over there,” Ross said. “When the first dude stepped up to Rozay, the lil’ short fat one that looked like Bam Bam Bigelow from wrestling. When he stepped up, I squatted down and his eyes had told him what I said.
“Basically, ‘Boy, if I hit you, I’ma see everything you ate for the last two days.’ His balls dropped out of his ass. He never said another word, he did never did nothing. He was a straight busta.”

You may not want to blast “Not Like Us” in Canada at a public appearance, but Rick Ross found out the hard way. Rozay was in Canada and got into a brawl after the Kendrick Banger was played. Ross’s team could be seen getting jumped and pummeled, with a punch getting in on Ross, too. One even says, “You are in our city.”
Just as a reminder, Ross had his own issue with Drake. This incident happened in Vancouver for the Ignite Music Festival.
