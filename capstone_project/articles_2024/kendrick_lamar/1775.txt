Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” earns an 11th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, extending 2024’s longest command.

	The hit, which became the Virginia-born singer-songwriter’s first Hot 100 No. 1 in July, is one of just five songs to reign for 11 or more weeks this decade, and the first since another country/pop crossover smash, Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night,” dominated for 16 weeks in March-August 2023.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” also furthers the longest No. 1 run on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart this year, logging a 15th week in the top spot.

	Plus, Chappell Roan notches her first top five Hot 100 hit as “Good Luck, Babe!,” which became her first top 10, leaps from No. 7 to No. 4.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Sept. 28, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 24).

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy),” on American Dogwood/EMPIRE (with country radio promotion by Magnolia Music), totaled 75.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (down 2%), 28.7 million official streams (down 2%) and 9,000 sold (down 7%) in the United States Sept. 13-19.

	The track holds for an eighth week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart; rebounds from No. 2 for a sixth week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs; and dips 2-3 following 13 weeks at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” extends the longest Hot 100 rule this year, and is one week away from doubling up on its closest competitor. Here’s a look at the songs that have led for multiple weeks since January:

	Meanwhile, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” ties for the fourth-most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in the 2020s. Here’s a recap:

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is one of an elite 30 No. 1s in the Hot 100’s 66-year history to run up 11 or more weeks on top – an honor that just over 2.5% of all No. 1s have achieved. All 30 such hits have led since the chart adopted electronically-monitored Luminate data in November 1991, at which point longer reigns than before subsequently became more common; since then, a still-select 7% of all No. 1s have led for 11 or more weeks.

	Chappell Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!” surges 7-4 on the Hot 100, surpassing its prior No. 6 high to become her first top five hit.

	The song drew 22.3 million streams, up 10%, and sold 4,000, up 20%, Sept. 13-19; the Missouri native performed it Sept. 11 at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, where she also won for best new artist. The track additionally tallied 47.7 million in airplay audience (down 1%).

	On the Sept. 21-dated Pop Airplay chart, the song became Chappell Roan’s first No. 1 on any Billboard radio ranking.

	Feeling ‘luck’-y: “Good Luck, Babe!” becomes only the fifth top five Hot 100 hit with “luck,” or a variation, in its title. Chappell Roan joins a star-studded group of acts to enjoy such fortune – and she and Elvis Presley (and the Jordanaires) are now the only acts with top five hits with both “good” and “luck” in their titles:

	(“Babe” steps: Meanwhile, “babe” appears in the title of a top five Hot 100 hit for the first time in 45 years, since Styx’s “Babe,” which ruled for two weeks in 1979.)

	Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, keeps at No. 2 on the Hot 100, following six weeks at No. 1 beginning upon its debut in May.

	Sabrina Carpenter charts three songs in the Hot 100’s top 10, all from her album Short n’ Sweet, for a fourth consecutive week: “Espresso” holds at its No. 3 high; “Taste” drops 6-8 after it debuted at its No. 2 peak; and “Please Please Please,” which led for a week in June, slips 8-9. Carpenter is the first artist this year to log four weeks with three simultaneous top 10s; Taylor Swift ranks second with two such frames.

	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” descends 4-5 on the Hot 100, four weeks after it debuted at its No. 3 best.

	Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” holds at its No. 5 Hot 100 high, as it tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a seventh week each.

	Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March, rises 9-7.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” repeats at No. 10, following two weeks at No. 1 in May and July, as it leads the multimetric Hot Rap Songs chart for a 19th week and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for a 17th week.
