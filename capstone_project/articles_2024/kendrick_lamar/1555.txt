SZA has teased the release of upcoming project, Lana, by unveiling a teaser trailer on social media.
While it has been debated whether Lana is going to be a standalone project or a deluxe edition of her smash hit SOS album, the trailer appeared to finally give us an answer.
The clip, which features a new song that prominently samples “Voyage to Atlantis” by the Isley Brothers, depicts SZA in the woods and squatting to go to the toilet.
Text then appears which says “Lana” followed by “SOS Deluxe”, seemingly confirming that the long-rumored project is an add-on to her critically acclaimed second album.
SZA also captioned the clip: “Clock starts now. Happy anniversary.”

While the singer has said that the clock has started, she has given no indication of when it will end or when the project will be released.
In a recent appearance on Kai Cenat’s livestream, SZA has appeared to confirm that she had a whole project separate to the SOS deluxe on the way.
She said: “There’s a whole new project that you will hear […] It will be out before the year is over.”
It was also teased in a recent Vogue cover story that SZA is currently working on two different projects. One is a deluxe edition of SOS and the other is her third album, which is called Lana.

SZA has been teasing an expansion of her blockbuster sophomore album for a while.
Late last year, she posted a number of potential covers for the deluxe version and suggested the project would drop before Christmas, but it never did.
She also spoke about the project in an interview with Billboard, saying: “After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done. I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself and not just smiling and nodding at accolades but really feeling it internally and knowing that I’m good enough.”
She added: “I guess I need to stop trying to figure out what it means and start realizing and living in what it is.”
