Drake has spent most of 2024 as the hip-hop world’s punchline, but at least one rapper says he’s done with the “Certified Lover Boy.” In his new cover story for Billboard, A$AP Rocky details why he’s trying to move on from the Canadian superstar and why he has zero interest in hip-hop beefs.
According to Vibe, before he was publicly drop kicked by Kendrick Lamar, Drake and Rocky traded barbs about the women in their lives, Rihanna and Sophie Brussaux, the mother of the “Take Care” rapper’s child. Now, Rocky is trying to get away from the back and forth, claiming he has better things to do.
“You got to realize, certain n**as was throwing shots for years. I ain’t in the middle of that shit. That’s not how I retaliate right now. I got bigger fish to fry than some p***y boys,” Rocky told Billboard.
He also explained that it comes down to understanding yourself as an artist. The importance of knowing when to push and when to hold back.
“You got to know yourself,” he said. “You got to know, ‘OK, this is too much. This is too far. This is overkill. This is not enough.’ That’s what I think makes you a unique artist: when you could determine what’s needed. And what’s unnecessary.”
His more mature approach to his work may stem from his feelings for his family. The “L$D” artist shares two sons—two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot—with Rihanna. He revealed how the busy duo make their family a priority, saying “It’s crazy how we find balance with our chaotic schedules.”
“[The relationship] is going great. I don’t think there’s a more perfect person because when the schedules are hectic, she’s very understanding of that,” Rocky said. “And when the schedule’s freed up, that’s when you get to spend [the] most time together. It’s all understanding and compatibility.”
