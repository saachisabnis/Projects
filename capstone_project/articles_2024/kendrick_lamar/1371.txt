In a surprising turn of events, Canadian rap icon Drake has publicly declared his disdain for former friend and NBA star DeMar DeRozan. This revelation came during a recent Toronto Raptors game against the Sacramento Kings, where Drake made it clear that he would not tolerate any honor bestowed upon DeRozan by the Raptors organization.
While sitting courtside, Drake warned that if the Raptors ever consider hanging a banner in DeRozan’s honor, he would personally “take it down.” This statement has sparked discussions among fans and commentators alike, as it highlights the tension between the two former friends.
The rift between Drake and DeRozan appears to stem from a recent incident involving Kendrick Lamar. DeRozan made an appearance in Lamar’s music video for Not Like Us, which many interpreted as a diss aimed at Drake amid their ongoing feud. This betrayal seems to have ignited Drake’s fierce reaction during the game.
During the game, Drake was seen engaging in some playful yet pointed antics, including mean-mugging DeRozan and reportedly calling him a “p—-” as the Kings exited the court following their narrow defeat, with a score of 128-131. Such behavior has only fueled the fire of their rivalry, leaving fans eager for more updates.
Despite Drake’s aggressive stance, DeRozan appeared largely unfazed by the rapper’s comments. When asked about Drake’s threat regarding the banner during a postgame press conference, he responded with a confident, “He gone have a long way to climb to take it down so tell him good luck.” This retort showcases DeRozan’s resilience and hints that he is not intimidated by Drake’s bravado.
The ongoing feud between Drake and DeRozan has captured the attention of fans and the media alike. As a prominent figure in both the music and sports worlds, Drake’s comments carry weight, and many are curious about how this rivalry will unfold in the future. The NBA community is no stranger to drama, but the personal nature of this conflict adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.
As the Raptors continue their season, all eyes will be on how this feud develops. Will Drake continue to make headlines with his antics, or will DeRozan rise above the drama? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the rivalry between these two stars is far from over.
