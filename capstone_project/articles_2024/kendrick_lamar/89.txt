Last night at the ESPY Awards, host and tennis legend Serena Williams looked stunning as she changed into eight different outfits throughout the evening. Not only was she beautiful, but Williams also managed to throw shade at Drake by dancing to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and make fun of Harrison Butker—the Kansas City Chiefs player who went viral earlier this year for saying “homemaker” should be a woman’s “greatest title.”
With help from stylist Kesha McLeod, here are all of Serena’s mesmerizing looks.
