Everybody from the West Coast was at Kendrick Lamar’s “The Pop Out” show, but Wack 100, who manages another legend who wasn’t there, The Game. Speaking with Vlad TV, Wack revealed why he wasn’t in attendance.
“I’m one of those where if you not on me about it, I’ll forget,” Wack 100 said. “I was in my studio, reconstructing my studio, stressing out over one of my podcast stands. I go looking for the guy and he told me the show was over at 8 o’clock sharp. I totally forgot, that’s when I hit Game.”
He would state The Game was at home with his lady as she was pregnant.
