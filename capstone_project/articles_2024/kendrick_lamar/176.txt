Drake has unveiled a new collaboration between the NFL and his OVO clothing brand.
Enveiled on Instagram on Wednesday (December 11), the “Gridiron Collection” includes a Sideline Puffer Jacket and a Training Pullover Jacket from a host of NFL teams, customized to feature Drizzy’s OVO owl logo.

The eight teams include the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, Las Vegas Raiders, New York Giants, Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers.
The collaboration goes on sale Friday (December 13) and will be available both online and in stores.
While Drake and the NFL have hooked up for collaborations in the past, this is the most notable as it comes just a few months before his rival Kendrick Lamar‘s much-discussed Super Bowl halftime show in February.
50 Cent recently questioned whether Drizzy’s legal action against Universal Music Group was an attempt to prevent Kendrick from performing his slanderous diss track “Not Like Us” at the event, which is usually watched by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

Speaking with Cam’ron on his Talk With Flee YouTube show, 50 said: “I’ve never seen that before. I’ve never seen a rap battle end up in a lawsuit. But I thought that was Drake’s team trying to prevent the Super Bowl from doing more damage.
“Because if you sue Apple and you sue Universal Music Group during the period where Apple is [behind] the music at the Super Bowl, they’re already in the lawsuits so they’re already having to incur costs to defend themselves.”

The G-Unit mogul also speculated that Drake’s attorneys have likely threatened the NFL by telling them: “We have this issue over this song. It’s already a pending case, we don’t want you guys to allow that to air [or] you’d be a part of the damages.”
OVO have also been busy with a number of other collaborations of late, recently releasing one with The Simpsons that was modeled by frequent Drake collaborator Lil Yachty.

The collection features a colorful hoodie featuring the hit show’s supporting characters, a varsity jacket with TV’s most famous family on the back and a baseball cap adorned with Bart Simpson, among other items.
The whole range can be picked up from OVO’s website, with prices starting at $38 for a drinks cup and going up to $898 for a wool and leather jacket that features the OVO owl on one breast and a pink donut on the other.
