DeMar DeRozan definitely knew his deal with the Sacramento Kings was close to being completed before the rest of us, because he just so happened to be attending an otherwise meaningless Sac Summer League game just minutes after it was reported he was heading West.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps reported Saturday night the completion of a three-team deal that moved DeRozan to Sacramento in a sign-and-trade from the Chicago Bulls, a deal that also sent Harrison Barnes from Sacramento to the San Antonio Spurs.
And minutes after that report, DeRozan showed up for his new team's California Classic game against China and received a loud standing ovation from the home crowd.
Not lost on anyone is the song playing in the background; Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. DeRozan, of course, is mentioned in the song when Lamar says "I'm glad DeRoz came home." DeRozan joined Lamar on stage when he performed the song five straight times at The Pop Out concert, and he made a cameo in the music video that debuted Thursday.
Sacramento isn't exactly DeRozan's native Los Angeles, but it's close enough.
