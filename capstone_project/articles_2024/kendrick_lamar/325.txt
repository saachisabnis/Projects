Legendary hip-hop group Gang Starr has returned to the music scene with “Finishem,” a new single that captures their signature sound while speaking to contemporary audiences. Released November 4, the track demonstrates why the duo remains influential in hip-hop culture.
The single showcases DJ Premier’s masterful production, featuring his trademark jazz samples and precise scratching techniques. The verses from the late Guru, recorded before his 2010 passing, deliver messages of determination and perseverance that feel particularly relevant today.
Gang Starr’s journey began in the late 1980s when Guru and Premier joined forces, creating a distinctive style that merged jazz-influenced beats with conscious lyrics. Their groundbreaking albums like “Step in the Arena” (1991) and “Daily Operation” (1992) helped establish jazz rap as a legitimate subgenre, influencing artists from Nas to Kendrick Lamar.
The duo’s impact extends beyond their six studio albums. Premier’s production work helped shape the sound of New York hip-hop, while Guru’s “Jazzmatazz” series pioneered the fusion of live jazz instrumentation with hip-hop elements. Their track “Mass Appeal” became an anthem for authentic hip-hop, rejecting commercial compromise in favor of artistic integrity.
“Finishem” maintains the duo’s high standards for production quality and lyrical depth. Premier’s intricate beat-making shines through layered samples and strategic scratches, while Guru’s vocals cut through with characteristic wisdom and clarity.
The track has garnered praise from critics and fans alike, with many noting how it manages to sound both classic and current. Its success on the charts demonstrates Gang Starr’s enduring appeal across generations of hip-hop listeners.
Premier has suggested more unreleased material exists in the vault, raising expectations for future releases. This single marks another chapter in Gang Starr’s storied career, which includes classics like “Moment of Truth” and collaborations with artists ranging from Nice & Smooth to J. Cole.
For hip-hop enthusiasts, “Finishem” represents more than nostalgia – it’s a reminder of the genre’s golden era while pointing toward its future. The track joins recent releases from artists like Russ, Isaiah Rashad and REASON in demonstrating hip-hop’s continued evolution.
As Gang Starr’s legacy expands through this new release, their influence on hip-hop culture remains undeniable. From their role in establishing the MC-producer duo format to their emphasis on sophisticated lyricism and jazz-influenced production, Gang Starr helped elevate hip-hop as an art form. “Finishem” serves as both a testament to their past achievements and proof that their artistic vision remains relevant in today’s musical landscape.
