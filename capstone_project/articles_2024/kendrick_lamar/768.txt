Although “Not Like Us” is being played nonstop in cities across the world, it seems that Drake may be doing his best to make sure it’s not listened to in one particular city that he frequents. Houston.
On Monday, DJ Ari, a popular Houston DJ, took to X to respond to someone who claimed, “Drake really got Not Like Us banned in Houston.”
In response, DJ Ari wrote, “Yea i done already got in trouble a few times for playing it at some clubs.”
This opened the floodgates, with hip-hop fans everywhere giving their thoughts on this claim. One user mocked a line from Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” saying, “You think Houston gon let you disrespect Drake n***a?”
Another account wrote, “It has probably less to do with drake requesting this than it does the fact that Houston f***s with him heavy and respects him enough not to allow that bulls**t to be played.”
One person commented, “isnt this some form of admission of losing and bitterness… and how is Houston letting anybody tell them what to play…
One user even commented on DJ Ari’s post, naming the spots that are not allowing the spots to play the track, writing, “Sekai, cle, prospect, kamp all said no.”
After noticing that her original post went viral, DJ Ari took to Instagram to clarify her comments, writing on her IG story: “Headlines can be misleading. Drake nor J Prince never told me not to play the song. Promoters and people that respect those guys told me not to and it was understood. That’s it, that’s all.”
Even if it’s not confirmed if Drake or anyone associated with him got the track shadow banned in Houston, the Toronto artist is still going out of his way to troll the Compton MC.
He recently posted a selfie on his Instagram showing himself wearing a Tupac shirt that read, “Only God Can Judge Me.” The 6 God could just like the shirt, but, likely, he’s just trolling K. Dot, as he has since the beginning of their beef.
