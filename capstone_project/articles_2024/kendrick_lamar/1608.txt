At long last, Normani has announced the title of her debut solo studio album, Dopamine. The album does not yet have a release date. See the album cover below.
Normani got her start with Fifth Harmony in 2012, and she featured on all three of the girl group’s LPs: 2015’s Reflection, 2016’s 7/27, and 2017’s Fifth Harmony. The pop singer released the Khalid collaboration “Love Lies”—her first single without her band—on Valentine’s Day in 2018, and, the next month, Fifth Harmony announced an indefinite hiatus.
Normani released her first true solo single, “Motivation,” in August 2019, and she’s since shared songs including “Diamonds,” “Bad to You,” “Wild Side,” “Fair,” and “New to You.” She also featured in Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar’s “Family Ties” music video.
