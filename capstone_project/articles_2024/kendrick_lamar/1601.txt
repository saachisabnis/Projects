Ab-Soul has given Rapsody her flowers, crowning her “one of the greatest MCs ever” — regardless of sex.
The North Carolina native swung through her “second home” of Los Angeles on Monday (October 21) to perform at the El Rey Theatre as part of her Please Don’t Cry Tour.

While the international trek is in support of her latest album of the same name, Rap turned back the clock during the concert as she brought out the TDE rapper to perform their 2016 collaboration “2 AM.”
Before departing the stage, Soulo made sure the crowd knew exactly how much he reveres the Roc Nation rapper.

“Ayo L.A., make some noise for one of the illest MCs to ever grace the mic,” he said to raptorous applause. “Not one of the illest female MCs; one of the illest MCs to ever grace the mic.
“I’m not playing about her. Anybody got any problems, you can see me outside. You know we about that. I appreciate y’all supporting my family right here, man.”

Rapsody reciprocated the love, heaping high praise on Soul’s forthcoming album: “On the way here, I was listening to his album Soul Burger ’cause I’m like that. That’s one of the greatest albums I’ve heard and I can’t wait for you to hear it. That shit is amazing.”
Rapsody put on an electrifying show at the El Rey Theatre as she rocked out onstage. Fans know her for her deep and soulful storytelling, but leading into each song, the crowd had a chance to experience a playful, comedic side to the poetic lyricist.

One of the funniest and most unexpected moments came when Rap spoke to the audience about one of her favorite “poets” during a brief intermission.
“On those days when you can’t see it for yourself and it’s hard for you to hear God, there’s somebody that always centers me. I love poetry, I love words. So there’s a poet that I always go to. Is it okay if I share?” she said.

“He’s a legendary poet. I’ve been holding onto this particular word since I was, like, a teenager. And the quote is: if you a fine muthafucka you should back that ass up.”
Rap then launched into a rendition of Juvenile‘s raunchy 1998 hit “Back That Azz Up.”

Ab-Soul isn’t the only West Coast rapper who holds Rapsody in high regard.
The longtime Jamla signee recently revealed that fellow Black Hippy Kendrick Lamar is a huge fan of Please Don’t Cry.

Speaking to Acton Entertainment following her performance at London’s Jazz Cafe Festival earlier this month, she said: “I hadn’t spoken to Kendrick in maybe a year and a half and he texted me out the blue. He had listened to the album and he was like, ‘Album is crazy!’
“We were just catching up. That’s our relationship, we always in and out. But he’s a beautiful human being too — raw, authentic, real, loving and I’m super proud of everything that he’s doing. He’s a great leader. He’s wearing it and walking it beautifully.”

She added: “He’s a real one. He stays tapped in to everything. He can be as quiet as he wants but I for sure know that he listens and watches everything. But again, I’m grateful and I appreciate him for just reaching out and saying it. But he’s always been that. Kendrick is as real as they come.”
