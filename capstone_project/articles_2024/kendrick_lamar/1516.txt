Stray Kids, an eight-piece South Korean K-pop group, has scored its sixth No. 1  album and second this year on the Billboard 200 albums chart, bumping Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” to No. 3 after it made a two-week return to the top. 

	With “HOP” at No. 1, Stray Kids are tied with Linkin Park, BTS and Dave Matthews Band for the most No. 1s among groups on the list since 2000. The 12-song “HOP” — composed of solo and group performances — logs a total of 187,000 units in its debut week, per Luminate. It’s the top selling album in the United States with a total of 176,000 albums sales.
