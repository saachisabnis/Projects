A rep for the Toronto rapper shared “there was never any intention or plan to send a cease and desist to anyone.”
It has been confirmed that the rumours of Drake sending Kendrick Lamar a cease-and-desist letter for ‘Not Like Us’ are not true.
This past weekend (September 28-29) the music manager Wack 100 went viral after taking to a chatroom on the Clubhouse app and claiming that the ‘Headlines’ rapper had “served a cease-and-desist [to] Kendrick Lamar so he can’t perform ‘Not Like Us,’” in an exchange with another Clubhouse user. He added that Drake was “trying to get the NFL to restrict Kendrick.”
Now, a representative for the ‘Hotline Bling’ rapper told Rolling Stone that the rumour was “not true,” with another source clarifying that “there was never any intention or plan to send a cease and desist to anyone.”
Drake was accused of sending a cease and desist letter to Kendrick Lamar to prevent him from performing Not Like Us at the Super Bowl. @Akademiks confirmed with Drake himself that he did not and said show proof if it was real… now Wack 100 says it was an error 😂🚲➡️ pic.twitter.com/l8t6wS12Mw

Earlier this year, Drake was hit with a cease-and-desist letter from the late Tupac’s estate after the Toronto rapper used AI replication of the ‘California Love’ rapper’s vocals on his Lamar diss track ‘Taylor Made Freestyle‘.
The rapper was told by litigator Howard King that his diss track must be taken down in less than 24 hours. If not, Tupac’s estate would go ahead and  “pursue all of its legal remedies” against him.
Drake went on to remove the track from all streaming platforms as well as all of his social media accounts following the lawsuit threat from the estate of the late West Coast rapper.
In other news, Lamar was recently named the headline performer for the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime show: “I don’t want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans, February 9, 2025. Wear your best dress too, even if you’re watching from home. Let’s go.”
The ‘Swimming Pools’ rapper also recently released a new single. It has yet to hit any streaming platforms and is reportedly titled ‘Watch The Party Die’ according to Variety.
