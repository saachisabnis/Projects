Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” is closing the year at No. 1 on the albums chart. For a 17th (nonconsecutive) week, Swift leads the list with her Grammy-nominated “Tortured Poets” logging 240,000 equivalent album units, according to Luminate. Over 80% of that total is fueled by physical album sales following the release of the album’s deluxe “Anthology” edition. 

	Kendrick Lamar’s “GNX” keeps its previous position at No. 2 with 125,000 equivalent album units with a strong presence on streaming. Lamar also claims three top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100: “Luther,” “TV Off,” and “Squabble Up” at No.s 7, 8 and 10, respectively.

Rosé‘s debut solo album “Rosie” follows at No. 3 with 102,000 equivalent album units earned and 70,000 album sales. 

	Twice earns its sixth top 10 album with “Strategy” entering at No. 4 with 88,000 album units sold. It’s the second top 10 for the group this year, the second behind their first No. 1, “With YOU-th” in March. The seven-song collection — featuring a collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion on the title — sold a total of 81,000 copies and debuts at No. 2 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart. 

Sabrina Carpenter’s holiday album, “Fruitcake” reenters the chart at No. 10 for its first week in the top 10, after its wide physical release. The LP also got a significant streaming bump following the release of her Netflix special, “Nonsense Christmas.” 

	With her chart-topping “Short n’ Sweet” still holding steady at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, Carpenter claims two Top 10 albums for the first time in her career.  She’s only the sixth artist in 2024 to have at least two albums in the top 10 at the same time (previously this year, Zach Bryan, Future, Metro Boomin, Swift and Morgan Wallen all claimed Top 10 albums concurrently).

	The holiday cheer continues on Billboard Hot 100 with Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” topping the list for a second week this year and 16th total week. The song matches her longest command on the chart, first set by “One Sweet Day,” with Boyz II Men, in 1995-96. Compared to the previous week, Christmas singles have significantly flooded the top 10 of the list. Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” is at No. 2; Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” is at No. 3; Wham!’s “Last Christmas” (1984) is at No. 4; and Burl Ives’ “A Holly Jolly Christmas” is at No. 5.
