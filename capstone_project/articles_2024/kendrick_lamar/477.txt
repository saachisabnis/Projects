Presidential candidate Donald Trump has finally spoken out about falsified AI images of Taylor Swift used to endorse him.
Trump, 78, shared the aforementioned images on his social media pages, seemingly under the impression that they were issued by Swift, 34, herself, or her camp. After the images circulated, When asked by Fox Business if he is afraid is Swift will sue him, Trump seemed unfazed at the idea. He further claimed that he didn't know anything about the AI images, but said that he later learned they weren't from Swift.
"I don't know anything about them, other than somebody else generated them," Trump said. "I didn't generate them. Somebody came out. They said, oh, look at this. These were all made up by other people. A.I. is always very dangerous in that way. It's happening with me too. They're making — having me speak. I speak perfectly, I mean, absolutely perfectly on A.I., and I'm, like, endorsing other products and things. It's a little bit dangerous out there."
Swift herself hasn't commented on the images, however, earlier this week, one musician reportedly threatened to send him a cease and desist. The warning came from Beyoncé after a video for the Trump campaign featured a clip of her Kendrick Lamar-collaboration "Freedom" from her 2016 album, Lemonade.
Beyoncé, however, reportedly cleared the use of "Freedom" for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.
This isn't the first time people have used Swift's likeness. Back in 2016, Kanye West used a body double of Swift in his video for "Famous." Last year, AI images of Swift depicted in sexual acts circulated the web, and she reportedly considered legal action.
