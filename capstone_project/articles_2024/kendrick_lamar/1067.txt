Did Snoop Dogg almost join OnlyFans? That’s the question on everyone’s mind after the “Gin and Juice” rapper’s latest appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” with Andy Cohen.
Speaking to the Bravo host alongside fellow guest and late night talk show host Seth Meyers and pal Martha Stewart on Sunday (Oct. 20), Snoop revealed that he was almost on the subscribers-only platform and was offered $100 million to join — but he ultimately turned it down. 
When asked by a viewer if he regretted that decision, Snoop said: “I did turn down $100 million, yes. The only part that regrets it is my friend down there...I told him ‘it’s not your decision.’ I’m not thinking with the little head this time. I’m gonna think with the big head and you’re not getting any of this,” referring to his genital area.
The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper previously expounded on why he ultimately said no to the deal, explaining on the Instagram Live series “Wake & Bake with Double S Express” back in January: “I got a Black wife. Ain’t no way in the world she gonna allow me to go on there and pull that thang out for no amount of money.”
Elsewhere in the interview, Snoop shared his thoughts on Kendrick Lamar being selected as the performer for the upcoming Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans in 2025.
“I believe he’s the biggest artist in the world right now. The NFL don’t make no mistakes with who they choose. And I support whoever they put on that stage because I know it’s going to be a great 13 minutes of performance,” he said.
As to whether or not Lil Wayne was snubbed by that decision given that the rapper is a NOLA-native and Kendrick isn’t, Snoop explained: “I don’t know if it was a snub, I just feel like the opportunity will come back again because it’s always in New Orleans, Atlanta—it’s always in that area. And I just feel like if it’s meant for Wayne to have it, they’ll give it to him ‘cause he is a legend. His music is worthy of that and I feel like it will come to him in due time.”
