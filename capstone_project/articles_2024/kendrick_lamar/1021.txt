Drake's Drizzmas Christmas giveaway was a success. The rapper and streamer Adin Ross partnered with online gambling company Stake to give away cash and prizes to many lucky winners. The livestream featured several standout moments.
Drake's post-Christmas giveaway kicked off last night (Dec. 26) on Drake's Kick channel. The prizes up for grabs included The Boy giving away a Lamborghini or G-Wagon, a dream vacation for a couple, a trip for two to see Drake live in Australia, one year's rent for two people, $100,000 for a Toronto artist or entrepreneur, $250,000 for two people and three cars for three families. People sent Drake letters with details of their lives and why they needed the items.
At one point during the stream, Drake read a letter from a prospective winner of the concert tickets and flight to Australia, in which the person appeared to put "F**k Kendrick Lamar" in an attempt to ingratiate himself with The Boy. However, Drizzy caught himself before completing the line.
"'It would be an unforgettable honeymoon filled with laughter, fun, and, of course, charisma,'" Drake reads in the video below. "'And it's always f**k Ken...' I am not reading that."
In another Kendrick-related moment, Drake referenced the diss track "Euphoria" when shouting out Sexyy Red. "When I see her, I see two bad ones, what's up?" Drake joked.
The stream also featured a moment in which Drake showed love to Future. The former frequent collaborators' relationship has been in question following Kendrick Lamar's Drake diss on Future and Metro Boomin's "Like That" in March.
Other moments included Drake's mom Sandra Graham popping out. Check out the highlights from Drake's Drizzmas Giveaway event below.
