Mariah Carey’s iconic holiday hit, “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” has returned to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, marking its sixth annual re-entry with 38 million streams and 24 million radio airplay impressions. The 1994 classic continues to dominate the charts during the festive season, edging out Kendrick Lamar’s “Squabble Up” and other holiday favorites like Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” and Wham!’s “Last Christmas.” Reflecting on the song’s enduring success, Carey shared, “It’s an incredible feeling to know this song still brings so much joy after all these years.”
