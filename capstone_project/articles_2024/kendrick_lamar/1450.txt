Pusha T‘s 2018 diss track aimed at Drake is arguably one of the most brutal attacks in Hip Hop history, so he is reportedly not too invested in the Canadian superstar’s ongoing beefs with Kendrick Lamar’s cohort.
In a clip from the Joe Budden Podcast that began circulating online on Tuesday (April 16), co-host Ice revealed that the Clipse MC doesn’t plan on getting involved in the turmoil, as he already has a win over Drizzy with “The Story of Adidon.”

Budden began by pointing out the risks the 6 God took by mentioning K.Dot’s wife on his latest track, recalling how viciously the Daytona rapper hit back when Drake did that to him a few years prior. To that point, Budden said that Drizzy even including the word “push” in the song’s title [“Push Ups (Drop & Give Me 50)”] was bold considering his past with Pusha.
Ice, however, said none of those minor details really matter to the Virginia native.

“I talked to Push [for] about two hours Saturday — just laughing, just laughing,” he said. “He ain’t thinking about this shit, bruh. He’s laughing; he got his already.”
In tune with the above claim, the 46-year-old MC recently laughed off Drizzy’s current feuds quite publicly.
“I just wanted to point out that after all these years of mob talk from Drake, nobody ever laid a finger on @PUSHA_T,” a person wrote on Twitter earlier this month, to which the Grammy nominee replied: “Not a pinky nail… [crying face emoji].”

Drake and Pusha have been feuding for over a decade, exchanging disses on record. The tension between the two climaxed when Push released “The Story of Adidon” a few years back, on which he revealed his adversary had a child with a former adult film star.
On the track, he raps: “You are hiding a child, let that boy come home/ Deadbeat motherfucker, playin’ border patrol, ooh/ Adonis is your son/ And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that’s real/ Love that baby, respect that girl/ Forget she’s a porn star, let her be your world, yuugh!”

Though there haven’t been too many developments in the Push v. Drake beef, Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar dropped “Like That” in late March, on which the Compton MC devotes his entire guest verse to taking shots at Drizzy and J. Cole.
The beef has since escalated a great deal, with Rick Ross, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky joining the California native’s side and Cole withdrawing from the beef after releasing a diss track of his own.
