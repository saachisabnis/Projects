Kendrick Lamar and Drake’s rap beef has gone from the studio to the stage to the top of the charts. And now the biggest lyrical feud in hip hop will be featured in a forthcoming documentary. Public Enemies: Kendrick vs Drake is produced by Acme Films and GroupM Motion Entertainment, and is set to air on Channel 4 in the U.K. A broadcast date for the U.S. has yet to be announced. Public Enemies will feature interviews with collaborators and contemporaries of the rap superstars, along with archival footage from throughout their celebrated careers. “It’s only a few years since our previous Public Enemies film for Channel 4 explored the rivalry between Jay Z vs Kanye,” said Acme Creative Director Jaimie D’Cruz. “But Public Enemies: Kendrick vs Drake feels like a story that takes place in a time when all the rules have changed, and beef is all around us.” (Rolling Stone)
