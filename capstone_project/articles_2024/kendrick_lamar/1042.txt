Tyler, The Creator was one of many special guests at Kendrick Lamar‘s ‘Pop Out‘ concert in June – though he initially wasn’t even scheduled to attend.
Talking to Billboard for his new cover story published on Wednesday (December 11), Tyler opened up about the experience and how it was fueled by a rare feeling for him: the fear of missing out (FOMO).

“I wasn’t even supposed to go — I was in Atlanta working on this album,” he said. “But I landed that morning and couldn’t miss this shit. And I don’t even get FOMO at all, n-gga — I’ll go to sleep. But I’m cool with Kenny and Dave [Free] and Tim [Hinshaw] from Free Lunch. So I went home, showered and ran straight there.”
While he didn’t do a full set, the Odd Future star ended up performing two songs at the sold-out show, including his 2019 hit “Earfquake.”

Tyler, The Creator has been enjoying a bumper year thanks to the release of his latest album Chromakopia.
The star-studded and deeply personal project has been a huge commercial success for the 33-year-old, spending three weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and selling over 500,000 copies in less than a month.

Chromakopia has also taken Tyler to new heights on the Billboard Hot 100, with “St. Chroma” and “Noid” becoming his first top 10 hits on the chart at number seven and number 10, respectively.
Tyler has since scored a third top 10 entry thanks to the GloRilla, Sexyy Red and Lil Wayne-assisted “Sticky,” which climbed to number 10 last month and has remained in high positions since.

The song has become a viral hit, and in November, Jackson State’s marching band performed a live version of the CHROMAKOPIA cut – leaving both Tyler and Sexyy in awe.
After catching the clip on social media, Tyler expressed how hyped he was because he produced the song with this exact type of arrangement in mind.
