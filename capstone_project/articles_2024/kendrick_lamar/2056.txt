The five-alarm five that was the diss war between Drake and Kendrick Lamar seems to finally be cooling down after reaching an apex last week. Here’s the latest around the beef and the two superstars embroiled in it.
Four diss tracks related to Drake and Kendrick’s feud are in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 this week. Kendrick’s “Not Like Us” premiered in the top spot, with “Euphoria” holding down number-three for the second week in a row. A little lower on the list, Metro Boomin and Future’s “Like That” at number-six and Drizzy’s “Family Matters” at seven. 
Kendrick has officially taken Drake's record for the most streams for a rap song in a single day, with "Not Like Us" surpassing Drizzy's Lil Baby collab "Girls Want Girls," racking up nearly 13 million streams in a single day.
DJ Akademiks has seemingly confirmed that the narrative Drake cooked up, around feeding Kendrick and his camp dirt on himself, was all cap. 
Drake has seemingly signaled that he’s ready to move on to a more peaceful era, sharing a picture of a Japanese samurai who is severely outnumbered and writing, “Good times. Summer vibes up next.” 
And then there’s 21 Savage, who is looking to stay out of the whole thing, and definitely isn’t about to pick sides. During an Instagram Live session, Savage warned, "Don't keep coming on to my Live talking about no [damn] beef… Metro my brother and Drake my brother. Those [guys] going to figure that [stuff] out eventually."
