Ab-Soul believes there's still time for Drake to redeem himself amid Kendrick Lamar's victory in their glorified beef. K.Dot's close friend took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday morning, July 9, and seemingly offered up a way Drizzy can rise from the ashes after he was burnt by Kendrick's smash hit "Not Like Us." "If Drake is the MC I imagine he can be. Redemption is not off the table," Soulo wrote. "Key word 'MC'. But b4 my rant gets out of context. He could never Fucc wit da Gang’Nem on sum rap shyt. That was Never a question."

Ab-Soul's comments come shortly after he appeared in the official music video for "Not Like Us" alongside K.Dot, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, Top and Punch. He also stood by Kendrick's side as the Compton native rapped the words to "6:16 In L.A." during "The Pop Out" concert on Juneteenth. Soulo has been down with Kendrick and the TDE crew for years. Nonetheless, it seems like the Herbert rapper still has enough respect for Drake to offer up a redemption arc for the Toronto MC. "We could still 'potentially' match 'artistry'. (Removing my obvious personal/educated bias)," he continued. "If this is taken as an antic of any sort and not ISM. Well… get off if you mad then. Dead homies."

As of this report, Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef hasn't escalated any further, even after the owl references in K.Dot's latest music video. Drake has gone on to release other features with the likes of Sexyy Red and Camila Cabello, but hasn't mentioned Kendrick on wax since "The Heart Part 6." While the beef might be dormant for now, Drake may be waiting for the right moment to strike back again.
