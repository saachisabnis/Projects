Rihanna making it in for R&B artist with no music is…
I guess Rihanna is there thanks to Lift Me Up, I’m more concerned about the nomination of Beyonce, whose only new contribution was the remix with Kendrick Lamar that I can dubiously call R&B. Mind you this is all down to the voting users, although I think next year they should put a minimum of music released for an artist to compete, it doesn’t make sense to be included for a single song when it’s competing in the song categories. My proposal is that an artist must have at least 3 released songs, an EP or an album.
Pd: shouldn’t this thread be highlighted in the forum?
It's me... Hi
5 days before voting closes and I just hope there are some recorded speeches this time (if Billie had one for the film edition, it’s possible), even if it was by the producers and songwriters of each album/song 🙏🕯️
It's me... Hi
Now that voting has closed, when will the winners be announced? 
Now that voting has closed, when will the winners be announced? 
Following the pattern of years past, possibly 2 or 3 days before the Grammys, Thursday or Friday.
Hopefully there will be winners speeches this time 🙏.
It's me... Hi
The winners will probably be announced tomorrow or Friday so I just want to say thank you Daniel and everyone involved in this, it’s fun to participate in this dynamic year after year. Also I’ve been spending my time making posters for all the nominees and wanted to give them to you as a gift.
