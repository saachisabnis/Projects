Not to body shame, but have y’all seen the hair follicles on Pharell’s Lego counterpart? They’re distressingly huge. So horrifyingly large and round that we wondered why anyone would green-light a project that makes them look like they got a back-alley hair transplant from someone who had only ever seen hair come out of a Play-Doh doll’s head. Piece by Piece, the Pharrell biopic out October 11, features the offending scalp in the trailer’s very first shot. “You know what would be cool is if we told my story with Lego pieces,” Lego Pharrell, voicing himself, tells the Lego director in an on-camera interview. “When I was a kid, I knew I was different. And people would say, ‘Oh, that’s an odd child.’” The rest of the trailer shows how music had an impact on the former Neptune and Kelis’s nemesis from an early age, tracing this childhood fascination to his industry rise in the ’90s. Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg also voice themselves.
