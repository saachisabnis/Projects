Drake didn't faze DeMar DeRozan after the Canadian rapper dragged the former Raptors player through the mud following his game in Toronto. DeRozan returned to the 6 with the Sacramento Kings on Saturday, November 2, to face off with the Toronto Raptors at the Scotiabank Arena. During the game, Drake joined the commentators and fired some shots at DeRozan and the Kings. Drizzy called the six-time all-star a "goof" and referred to DeRozan's team as "clowns." After the team honored former NBA star Vince Carter, Drake said Raptors shouldn't do the same for DeRozan. "If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I'll pull that thing down myself," he said.
After he got off the mic, Drake and OVO Chubbs sat courtside for the remainder of the game. They appeared to mean-mug DeRozan whenever he touched the court. The 38-year-old rapper even muttered "F**k outta here, p*ssy" as the Kings' guard-forward walked by him. Once his comments went viral online, fans quickly pointed out that the "Family Matters" rapper still hasn't forgiven DeRozen for taking Kendrick Lamar's side during their high-profile beef over the summer. Drake and DeRozan used to be cool during and after the 35-year-old's career with the Toronto Raptors. Things went south after the Compton native was traded to the Sacramento Kings and co-signed Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" in the middle of his battle with Drake. DeRozan even joined Lamar at "The Pop Out" concert and the music video for "Not Like Us." After the game, DeRozan was asked about Drake's on-air comments about pulling down his banner. "He's going to have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck," he said.
