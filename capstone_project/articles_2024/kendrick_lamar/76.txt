WE DON’T TRUST YOU debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 following its release and the track ‘Like That’ with Kendrick Lamar leads Billboard’s Hot 100 for the third week in a row.

He went from cooking up beats in a basement for the Dungeon Family to generational superstardom with a presence looming from the streets all the way to The Met Gala.
Since 2013, diamond-certified producer, DJ, and artist Metro Boomin has defined not only the sound, but the direction of hip-hop. Tallying tens of billions of streams, he impressively endures as the “Highest-Streaming Producer” in music.
