“I can’t sleep until it’s complete #MIXTAPEPLUTO,” he wrote.
He didn’t, however, reveal when the as-yet-untitled tape will arrive.

Earlier this month, Future appeared to indicate he was gearing up to release a new mixtape when he tweeted: “MAY TENTH [sneezing face emoji] MIXTAPE PLUTO.”
He also took a swipe at an unnamed rival, adding: “Fuck yo album Shit ain’t slappin like my MIXTAPE.”

The latter was interpreted by many as a shot at Gunna, whose One of Wun album was already scheduled to arrive on May 10.
Future also previously appeared to take aim at Gunna when he posted and deleted a link to his “Prada Dem” video before sharing a snippet of his song “Type Shit” where he rapped: “I don’t hang with rats, that’s some new type shit/ Get a n-gga whacked on the news type shit.”

Seemingly hitting back in similarly cryptic fashion, the YSL rapper wrote on X: “Turn this shit bac up Notch……! Fuc What These boys talkin bout.”
Instead, Hendrix’s combative tweet turned out to be promo for his collaboration with Tee Grizzley, “Swear to God,” which dropped on May 10 and included the lyrics: “Fuck your album, shit ain’t slappin’ like my mixtape.”

While fans continue to sit tight, a new Future mixtape will add to what’s already been a banner year for the Freebandz boss who has released two joint albums with Metro Boomin.
March’s We Don’t Trust You and it’s follow-up We Still Don’t Trust You, which landed weeks later, both topped the Billboard 200 with over combined first-week sales of almost 400,000.

The back-to-back releases also sparked what’s been called by many as the greatest rap beef of all time, lighting the match that led to Kendrick Lamar and Drake exchanging explosive diss songs.
