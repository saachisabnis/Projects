The sudden appearance of Kendrick Lamar‘s Section.80 loosie “Money Without Me” is hyping up fans for a supposed deluxe version of his latest album, GNX.
The now-removed track appeared on Dot’s official YouTube channel with a cover art that shows a 1987 Buick Grand National, the same car that appears on the album cover of GNX. Its sudden release got fans wondering if it served as a teaser to GNX (Deluxe) or if the rapper’s account simply got hacked, especially now that “Money Without Me” has been removed.
While Lamar himself has yet to announce the deluxe of GNX, album collaborator Lefty Gunplay previously said The Bootleg Kev Podcast that Kendrick is working on the deluxe. “Yeah, I rapped on that beat. Got some stuff…I know he’s got a deluxe version coming out,” he said, also hinting at a music video for “tv off.”
Stay tuned for an official announcement.
