Beyoncé performed during halftime of the Christmas Day game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans, and she stole the show.
It was a phenomenal performance, which streamed on Netflix. Beyoncé also performed during the Super Bowl in 2013 and 2016. Candidly, we would not mind if she just performed every year.
This year, however, the performance is going to an iconic rapper. Kendrick Lamar will perform the 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans. He has a tough act to follow after Beyoncé put on such a memorable show in Houston, though.
But if anyone can do it successfully, K-Dot absolutely has a shot. He has already performed in the Super Bowl and did a phenomenal job while in Los Angeles.

He will play songs from his new album, GNX, which includes some amazing sports references throughout.
While he is not Beyoncé, especially after his rap beef with Drake, he has a chance to put on a memorable show for fans around the world as well.
