 Batman posting Philippines Hot 100 updates… 
HAHAHAHAH my bad! It was just to put forward that the song is a success because it’s the first international song to top the charts
DWAS to get vinyl release the week of the Joker movie release, they also have many pre-recorded performances stored away and Bruno released a live version of Leave the Door Open to secure the #1 spot, they still have Lady Gaga’s lead.
the campaign is going to be massive, I still wonder how what kind of crazy person isn’t putting them as the main bet for a sweep
Manifesting “Birds of a Feather (Remix) feat. Beyonce & Adele” + the highest budget MV of Billie’s career, appearances on multiples talk shows, interviews about how they made the song in their bedroom, private performances for members of the recording academy and fundraisers for nonprofit organizations around the world to prevent that tragedy.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall

Wouldn’t be surprised if they’re going to perform on SNL, for a post-election show in November. It would be great exposure in line with voting periods, LG7 lead is coming in October so Gaga could be listed as the performer to do that + DWAS.
If a Rap album was going to get into AOTY, who has the best chances?
My money is on Doja. I wonder if they’ll submit the standard version of Scarlet, or the deluxe (Scarlet 2 CLAUDE).

My guess would be Eminem has the best chance. Recency bias + a lot of publicity for his return. Reviews were middling, but I think his name recognition gets some votes. 
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”

It’s interesting to note though that since they’ve switched to a straight vote for general field the only rap music to be nominated in the big 3 has been Kendrick Lamar and the random God Did nomination in SOTY. On paper it’s very possible that Doja is able to get in due to cross genre support and vote splitting amongst the many pop albums, but with rap not being super successful in the current system it’s hard for me to be confident in that. It’ll be interesting
Edit: I forgot Donda, but that did only get in due to Grammys changing from 8 to 10 so it kinda doesn’t count 
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time”
 Not to be rude as well but for years everytime Gaga was in contention y’all always used the fucking tiring charts argument against her, now y’all deserve the fucking update daily to death. 
As a Gaga fan myself, y’all sometimes do the most to make people root against her.
He wasn’t saying anything against Gaga. It’s an unspoken rule we’ve had for a very long time to keep this thread focused on the Grammy’s. Daily updates should go into LG7 thread. It’s fine to have chart performance updates here from time to time, but not every single day.
I really don’t wanna predict ABS. It’s the one big song this year that I definitely don’t care for. I think Beautiful Things will get nominated. So the last spot is between ABS and WCBF. I’m going with WCBF.
Hopefully alphabetical curse pulls through and gives Beautiful Things & WCBF the advantage in ROTY.
ABS will probably make SOTY however.

At first I was like, damn, that’s an A+ roast right there. Solid joke.
Then I scrolled back a couple pages and realized you were just literally describing what actually happened 💀

girl I am ready for their one on one with Zayn Lowe, Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Walters and Niel Degrassi Tyson 6 hour long special, talking about and dissecting the lyrics of the undeniable masterpiece that is Birds of a Feather. A song about their parents; two failed Hollywood actors struggling through life in LA putting food at the table and paying for their two precious babies musical careers. 😭 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
Doja’s album has been forgotten. Her only chance is in SOTY because of Agora Hills’ ballot placement and that’s it.

Funny how you talk more about Birds of a Feather than the masterpiece that is Fortnight

I agree. It’s too bad cause it’s a great album
