The project will also feature the producer’s rapping debut on a track titled “Pray For Me,” which he released earlier this month.
Check out the full tracklist below.
Due out on July 26, Faith Of A Mustard Seed was announced soon after Mustard achieved the first No. 1 song of his career, thanks to Kendrick Lamar’s Drake diss track “Not Like Us.”
To that point, ScHoolboy Q has expressed excited over L.A.’s return to the music scene at the hands of the 34-year-old producer.

Continuing with the LA energy, the album got its title from the late Nipsey Hussle.
When working on the title track for the producer’s last album, 2019’s Perfect Ten, Nipsey suggested that Mustard name the effort Faith Of A Mustard Seed. The producer, however, had already locked in the aforementioned title at the time.

“And [Nipsey] was like, ‘Well before it’s all said and done, you gotta do Faith Of A Mustard Seed,’” he recalled in a June interview with Big Boy’s Neighborhood.
When the West Coast beatmaker began working on the new project, he actually had a different title in mind (that he may still use), but when he knew that Nip’s suggested title made sense after he sampled a Luther Vandross cut because his mother is a huge fan of the singer.
