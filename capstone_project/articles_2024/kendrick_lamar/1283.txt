Get real!  Muni Long is NOT happening in Album of the Year.  Pure delusion.  She will be relegated to R&B only.  Plus, her new album will be D.O.A.
I really like you so I’d say for you to give “So Long, London”, “Guilty as Sin?” and “Peter” a try. Those are the highlights for me.

Well, I like you too so I played those, they were well written and I liked the production of So Long London.

Is there a backstory to fans calling an artist mother? I first noticed this with Gaga fans revering her with Mother Monster.

Not predicting it but do y’all think Jacob Collier will submit his album to Pop Vocal Album?
I like the vibe of Shawn Mendes’ upcoming album + it was produced by my beloved, Mike Sabath, AKA RAYE’s & Lizzo’s producer. Please listen everyone ❤️.

i kind of agree with AOTY being the consensus 7 + somebody r&b. i’d bet on Childish Gambino first, but i keep thinking about Lucky Daye  too

I think it’s Gambino: Great album + good reputation + great Grammy history. It’s my preferred for AOTY win actually, just that GD is still raving over Brat, I’m reserving the Gambino discussion for later.

Regarding the “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” vs “Texas Hold Em,” I think we will have a better understanding where Country voters will send their votes to when it boils down to those songs when the Country awards roll around. “Texas” really came and went. “A Bar Song” will be around thanks to radio. Beyoncé might be a Grammy favorite, but she’s not a Country favorite. They might view Shaboozey as the “real” Country act. I think Shaboozey  top 4 in Record of the Year frontrunners right now.
A Bar Song (Tipsy) is a fantastic song. It should win Best Country Solo Performance and Country Song.

I agree Childish could be the r&b pick this year in AOTY, even though his album isn’t totally r&b but he’s getting major support for them and probably other fields.
i wonder if it’ll hurt shaboozey that the rest of his album is doing nothing. looks like none of his other stuff has even cracked the spotify top 200.
