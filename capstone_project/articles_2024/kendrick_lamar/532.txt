Jay Electronica recently went on a fiery rant defending Jay-Z against backlash over the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show. Fans of Lil Wayne have criticized Jay-Z, blaming him for picking Kendrick Lamar over Wayne to perform at the New Orleans event. Jay Electronica, however, had some harsh words for those pointing fingers at Hov.
On Wednesday, September 11th, Jay Electronica took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his frustration, calling out not only those criticizing Jay-Z but also powerful figures in the music industry. “Nggas got all this smoke for Hov but they ain’t got no smoke for David Geffen and jimmy iovine and lucían grange and lyor cohen etcetera etcetera. I DO NOT RESPECT YOUR GANGSTER. You pssy,” he wrote.

The Roc Nation artist also seemed to respond to Hurricane Chris’ earlier comments about 50 Cent’s Humor & Harmony festival in Baton Rouge. Jay continued, “Yall better stop respecting these false gangstas who will kill they brother at the gas station over a few words or a few dollars and then run and throw they gun in the bushes when the police come.”
He further referenced Wesley Muhammad, saying, “Like @wesleymuhammad labeled these n*ggas correctly… You bully COONS. WE DO NOT RESPECT YOUR GANGSTA…”
In another post, he defended 50 Cent’s efforts in Louisiana, writing, “@50cent just opened an entire industry in Shreveport and these pssy as n****s slave cooning over a football game.”
Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, responsible for the NFL’s live music strategy, has been receiving heat for choosing Kendrick Lamar as the 2025 Super Bowl headliner over Lil Wayne. Neither Jay-Z nor Wayne has addressed the backlash yet.
