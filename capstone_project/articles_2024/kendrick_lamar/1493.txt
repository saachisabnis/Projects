Nicki Minaj has clarified her feelings towards Kendrick Lamar after launching into an angry social media rant about his upcoming Super Bowl performance.
In a series of explosive posts on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday (September 9), the Young Money rapper accused JAY-Z, who helps organize the halftime show, of intentionally denying Lil Wayne the chance to headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, which takes place in his hometown of New Orleans next February.

Nicki’s tirade continued on Monday evening as she fired off more posts about Weezy’s Super Bowl snub, including one mentioning Kendrick by name.
Making it clear that her previous comments weren’t meant to disparage the Compton rap star, she wrote: “You can love & respect Kendrick and still love & respect Wayne. Even Kendrick loves & respects Wayne. Every real rapper loves & respects Wayne.”

In a separate post, Nicki further defended her mentor and label boss, saying: “God forbid if Wayne was to leave this earth right now, the culture would be in mourning. That’s why so many ppl keep saying to give our legends their flowers while they are still around to smell them.”
She then called out her ex-manager Gee Roberson, who has also worked with the likes of JAY-Z, Drake and Kanye West: “Sitting around all day playing games with ppl life & legacy. God ain’t sleep. Gee Roberson you will learn that, too. Very soon.”

In response to another user who argued that Kendrick, not Lil Wayne, was the right person to headline the 2025 Super Bowl, the Queen rapper hit back: “God will punish you. Mark my words. The man that has not only pushed his pen the hardest, but gave the game more than 1 hip hop ICON as well on his watch?
“Represent the RAP game?!?!! The best RAPPER don’t represent the RAP GAME well enough 4u? Black ppl. Wow. If this don’t hurt your heart to read, it will one day. Look @ how our legends keep being treated. After they’ve given so much to us.”

In her initial rant, Nicki Minaj tore into JAY-Z, albeit without mentioning him by name.
She accused him of preventing Lil Wayne from headlining next year’s Super Bowl halftime show — a gig he had openly coveted — due to his “hatred” of herself, Birdman and Drake, as well as his own “ego.”

The “Super Freaky Girl” hitmaker also called Hov “spiteful,” “evil” and “disgusting,” labeled him a “house n-gger” and claimed he’s in bed with the police and politicians.
Nicki isn’t the only Hip Hop figure who has pointed the finger at JAY-Z for Lil Wayne’s Super Bowl snub.

Cam’ron also blamed the Roc Nation boss while reacting to Kendrick Lamar being picked to perform at next year’s halftime show on his sports talk show It Is What It Is.
Referencing Jigga and Weezy’s past rivalry, the Dipset rapper said: “It’s one person who’s stopping this. It’s not really a secret. Lil Wayne had a problem with somebody before who’s kinda part of the organization running it. This is payback. Who’s Lil Wayne’s artist? Drake. This is crazy, bro. It’s ridiculous.”

Cam also admitted that he “hate[s] the selection,” adding: “Lil Wayne not to be performing in New Orleans for the Super Bowl is egregious, and it gotta stop.”
JAY-Z has yet to address the backlash, although in a statement coinciding with the initial announcement, he praised Kendrick Lamar as “a once-in-a-generation artist.”

“His deep love for Hip Hop and culture informs his artistic vision,” Hov added. “He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendrick’s work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come.”
