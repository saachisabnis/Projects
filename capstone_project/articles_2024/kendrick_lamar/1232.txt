Drake is attempting to extinguish the flames that shot out of Kendrick Lamar’s four-alarm diss track “Euphoria” on April 30.
Drake uploaded a clip from the 1999 comedy 10 Things I Hate About You where Julia Stiles’ character recites a poem about the things she hates about a crush even though she also loves them.
Drake’s post is the response from “Euphoria” where Kendrick raps: “I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress / I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it’s gon’ be direct / We hate the b—— you f—, ’cause they confuse themself with real women.”
Moreover, the Toronto-born emcee used a liaison in DJ Akademiks to relay an ominous message about what’s coming in terms of a response to Lamar’s track.
“I’m energized by the elimination of Drake … See you soon,” Akademiks said Drake told him in a personal text. 
 “If you think this is fire, you have no idea what I got coming,” Drake reportedly added. 
Drake will have a lot to respond to as Lamar destroyed him on “Euphoria” on multiple of subjects, including:
Fans of both rappers — and hip-hop in general — seem pleased that the music genre is trending back to the battle rap days of hip-hop lore.
