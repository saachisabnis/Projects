Drake and A$AP Rocky, once collaborators, have been exchanging disses ever since the Toronto native appeared to take a shot at former flame and Rocky’s current girlfriend Rihanna.
On his For All the Dogs song “Fear of Heights,” he rapped: “Why they make it sound like I’m still hung up on you? / That could never be / Gyal can’t run me / Better him than me / Better it’s not me.”

He also seemingly referenced RiRi’s 2016 album ANTI: “I’m anti, I’m anti / Yeah, and the sex was average with you / Yeah, I’m anti ’cause I had it with you / Okay, I’m auntie like your daddy’s sister / Auntie like a family picture / And I had way badder bitches than you, TBH / Yeah, that man, he still with you, he can’t leave you / Y’all go on vacation, I bet it’s Antigua.”
Rocky later responded via his guest verse on Kid Cudi’s “WOW” where he said: “These n-ggas can’t stomach me, gotta go get a mandrake.”

Rocky followed up by jabbing Drizzy again on Metro Boomin and Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Show of Hands.”
“N-ggas swear they bitch the baddest, I just bagged the worst one / N-ggas in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin’? / I smashed before you birthed son, Flacko hit it first, son,” he spit, claiming that he once slept with Drake’s baby mother Sophie Brussaux.

The Harlem native also appeared to throw shade at Drake’s For All the Dogs: “Still don’ trust you, it’s always us, never them / Heard you dropped your latest shit /Funny how it just came and went (Ha ha ha).”
Drake would respond to Rocky, as well as his various other enemies such as Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and The Weeknd — on his diss track “Family Matters.”

“Rakim talkin’ shit again / Gassed ’cause you hit my BM first / N-gga do the math, who I was hitting then / I ain’t even know you rap still ’cause they only talking ’bout your fit again / Probably gotta have a kid again before you think of dropping any shit again / Even when you do drop they gon’ say you should model cause it’s mid again,” he rapped.
He added: “Smoking Fenty ’bout they shoulda put you on the first one you tryna get it in / Ask Fring if this a good idea next time you cuddled in the bed again / She’ll even tell ya leave the boy alone before ya get your head split again.”
