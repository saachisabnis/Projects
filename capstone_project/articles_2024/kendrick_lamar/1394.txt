In her first official visit to her campaign headquarters on July 22, Vice President Kamala Harris walked out to Beyoncé’s song, “Freedom.” According to CNN, Harris got the approval from Beyoncé’s representatives to use the song for her presidential campaign.
The singer has not officially endorsed Harris, but allowing her to use one of her songs speaks louder than words.
“Freedom” — which features Kendrick Lamar — comes from Beyoncé’s 2016 album Lemonade. The song was used as an anthem in many spaces after the death of George Floyd in 202o. At her campaign headquarters, Harris walked out to the lyrics that said, “Freedom, freedom, where are you? / ‘Cause I need freedom, too / I break chains all by myself / won’t let my freedom rot in h—. / I’ma keep running / ‘cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.”

Beyoncé has endorsed several Democratic candidates throughout her career. She sang the national anthem at Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2o13. In 2016, Jay-Z and she headlined a concert for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland. In 2020, Beyoncé made a post on her Instagram, endorsing President Joe Biden and Harris while urging her followers to vote.
Tina Knowles, Beyoncé’s mom, recently endorsed Harris after Biden announced that he won’t be running for a second term. Knowles recently posted a picture of her alongside Harris on Instagram.
“New, youthful, sharp energy !!!!” Knowles’ post stated. “Putting personal ego, power and fame aside. That is the definition of a great leader. Thank you, President Biden for your service and your leadership. Go, Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Let’s Go.”
Harris set a new presidential donation record, raising $81 million in 24 hours for her presidential campaign, and Win With Black Men just raised over $1 million for her in less than two hours.
