It's an esports kind of weekend.
Hello, everyone at Shacknews. Second week in a row that I'm back. The streak is going to end at "two," because next week I'm on site at TwitchCon. For now, let's enjoy another round of news, memes, and entertainment. This is the Friday edition of Evening Reading.
And, because it's the weekend, go find yourself something to play!
Here's some rapid-fire news to wrap up your week.
Hey, we're going esports-heavy tonight!

Accuracy in Sunday Pick'ems
After several minutes of the "NFL Live" cast discussing how they like the Chiefs over the Bengals, their graphics department trolled them by showing them all picking Cincinnati. That drew quick rebuttals and disclaimers: "We all picked the Chiefs, actually!" pic.twitter.com/4NKxF8kkiD
Yeahhhhhhhhhh, nobody's picking the Bengals.
Good Grief

This week in Shaqnews
Did Shaquille O'Neal really throw Tim Walz out of his restaurant? Nope, the claim originated from a source that labels its content "satire." https://t.co/IPaeDTqqpv pic.twitter.com/clv1KSbUJ1
Shaq is not immune to the kind of disinformation plaguing social media today.

Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but heâ€™s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke?
