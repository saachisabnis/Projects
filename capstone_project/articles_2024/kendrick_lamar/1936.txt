Ice Cube did not hold back when addressing a decade-old conspiracy theory spreading across the internet. The N.W.A member took time to address a social media user’s attempt to implicate him in the alleged covert scheme.
A clip of Krayzie Bone discussing a 2012 anonymous letter titled “The Secret Meeting that Changed Rap Music and Destroyed a Generation” made its way to X. That blind item claimed powerful individuals in the music business met in 1991 to push an agenda of promoting criminal activity in rap music to help fill for-profit private prisons.
“I believe [Ice Cube] likely has direct knowledge of ‘the secret meeting’ that Krayzie Bone was referring to in the above long clip,” @The_777_lioness tweeted on Monday (January 29). The X account also suggested N.W.A inspired record labels and the prison system to boost “crime culture” for profit.
Ice Cube quote-tweeted @The_777_lioness and added, “Opinions are like a#######. Everybody has one and they all stink! What evidence do you have to make a statement like that?” That response from the Hip-Hop legend led to an apology from the self-professed fan of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

N.W.A rose to national prominence in the late 1980s with singles such as “Straight Outta Compton,” “Express Yourself” and “F### Tha Police.” The gangsta rap pioneers faced significant backlash from police organizations, the FBI and conservative politicians.
Ice Cube eventually parted ways with Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella to pursue a solo career. The Los Angeles-raised MC dropped classic albums like 1990’s AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted and 1991’s Death Certificate.
Kendrick Lamar inducted Ice Cube and the other members of N.W.A into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. A year earlier, the critically acclaimed F. Gary Gray-directed Straight Outta Compton biopic grossed over $200 million at the global box office.
