Drake has always been known to be very generous with the people around him. This may be the funniest story of them all. The 6 God caught wind of a Drake “look-alike” contest in Toronto. Many various versions were in attendance. Nothing Was The Same Drake, curly-headed Drake, & even conrows Drizzy. The “twin” that stood out the most and the look-alike contest winner was Girl Drake and she went home with the winning prize PLUS $10,000 courtesy of The Boy.
Despite facing a tough year in 2024, with his ongoing beef with Kendrick Lamar and public challenges, Drake has remained a good sport about the jokes and critiques aimed at him. While the rivalry with Kendrick, Metro Boomin, & Future has sparked heated debates, with fans often pitting the “20 v 1” against him, Drake has handled the situation with humor. In Drake-like form, instead of getting defensive or bitter, he often laughs off the memes and jokes about his style, persona, and even his music. For instance, he’s known to post about his “L’s” on social media, showing that he doesn’t take himself too seriously. His ability to embrace the jokes has made fans love him even more. Rather than let them break him down,  he has earned respect for being confident and self-aware. Even in the face of tough competition, (which in this case was choosing who looks like him the most) Drake has shown that he can take the heat and still stay cool, proving his maturity as an artist.
