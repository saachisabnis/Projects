Rap superstars Drake and Kendrick Lamar  continued their ongoing beef on Friday and Lamar may have landed a knockout blow.
Kendrick began the day by releasing a track entitled “6:16 in LA” and Drake responded with a track called “Family Matters” that accused Lamar of domestic violence and fathering a child that isn’t biologically his, but rather that of his close friend and former Top Dog Entertainment president Dave Free.
But Kendrick got the last laugh, it appears, with a new song entitled ‘Meet the Grahams‘ where he alleges Drake has a daughter that the world does not know about.
“Dear baby girl, I’m sorry that your father not active inside your world,” Kendrick raps. “He don’t commit to much but his music, yeah that’s for sure. He a narcissist, misogynist, living inside his songs. Tried to destroy families rather than taking care of his own.
“Should be teaching you times tables or watching Frozen with you. Or at your 11th birthday singing Palms with you. Instead he be in Turks, paying for sex a popping percs. Examples that you don’t deserve.”
Of course, Drake’s most famous beef prior to Kendrick was with Pusha T, who revealed to the world that Drake had a son named Adonis who had not acknowledged.
“You are hiding a child, let that boy come home,” Pusha T rapped.
Fans couldn’t believe it happened again.

If this is true, Drake might just need to hold the L on this one.
