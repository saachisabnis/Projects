Drake has chopped off his signature cornrows, and fans have several thoughts about it. On Saturday night, November 16, Drizzy took to his Instagram Story and shared a brand-new selfie that revealed his fresh haircut. The 37-year-old reverted back to his original fade after rocking the notable cornrow braids for over two years. Fans couldn't resist commenting on his new 'do. Some people celebrated the fact that he got rid of the braids. Others were too caught up on the look of his face to worry about his hair. "I could go the rest of my life without seeing another Drake pucker lip selfie please," one fan wrote.

Fans also suggested that Drake's new look might mean more new music is on the way. Following his beef with Kendrick Lamar over the summer, Drizzy hopped on several collaborations before he shared some fresh singles from his 100 GIGS project. He shared songs like "Housekeeping Knows" with Latto, "It's Up" featuring 21 Savage & Young Thug and "No Face." He previously dropped the music video for the latter track earlier this month. In addition to those tracks, Drake is also preparing to release a joint album with PARTYNEXTDOOR. The OVO Sound co-founder first announced the plans for his long-awaited project with PND back in August during the final night of his signee's "Sorry I'm Outside Tour" in their hometown of Toronto. "On behalf of me and Party, we’ve been working on something for y’all,” Drake told the crowd. After the concert, PND shared revealed some details about their collaborative effort during an interview with Awaiz Punjani. When asked to name his favorite collaboration with Drake, PND referred to the one they're currently working on now, and confirmed it will have 15 tracks. “The one we doing right now,” he said. “All 15 we doing right now.”As of this report, Drake and PND's joint album does not have a release date.
