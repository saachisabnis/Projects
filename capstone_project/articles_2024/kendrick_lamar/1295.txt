Kanye’s unexpected shoutout comes shortly after a video of Drake recording his reference track for “Yikes” emerged as part of the Toronto rapper’s 100 Gigs content dump.
Although Drizzy was credited as a songwriter, the track — and the rest of ye — arrived at the height of his beef with Kanye’s close collaborator and then-G.O.O.D. Music labelmate Pusha T.

Yeezy himself was dragged into the back-and-forth, with Drake taking shots at him on “Duppy Freestyle” and creating a faux $100,000 invoice for “promotional assistance and career reviving” addressed to G.O.O.D. Music and Def Jam.
Drake even alluded to lending his pen to Kanye on “Duppy Freestyle,” rapping: “I’ve done things for him I thought that he never would need / Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me / I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat.”

The friendly gestures are a sharp 180 from earlier this year when Ye dissed his “Forever” collaborator, as well as J. Cole, on a remix of Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s “Like That.”
“Y’all so out of sight, out of mind / I can’t even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry,” he rapped.
