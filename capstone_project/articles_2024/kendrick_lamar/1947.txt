1. The Diesel has been activated.
Shaquille O’Neal caught some flak this week after telling Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokíc that he thought the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should’ve won the MVP award.
This took place on TNT when Jokíc was being interviewed by the Inside the NBA crew immediately after it was announced that he had won his third MVP.
“You know I love you, the best player in the league. I want to congratulate you," O'Neal said to Jokić during the TNT pregame show. "But I want you to hear it from me first. I thought that SGA should've been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you, but congratulations."
Shaq’s bold, but honest, approach generated a reaction from ESPN’s Shannon Sharpe, who took O’Neal to task on his Nightcap podcast.
“Shaq should have five MVPs,” Sharpe stated. “He sees a guy like Nikola Jokić that’s not as dominant as him, gets three [MVPs] in four years, I think a part of Shaq is envious of that.
“It’s hard for me to put somebody in the GOAT conversation with one MVP,” Sharpe added. “So we going to take somebody with one regular season MVP and put him in front people that got three, that got four, that got five. If he had my work ethic, he had 40,000 points.”

This criticism did not sit well with the Big Aristotle, who used Instagram to rip Sharpe. " i kno you tryna stay relevant by gossiping on your podcast. we don’t believe you. you need more people and in case you forgot. 4 rings three finals Mvp top 50 and top 75. google me."

Personally, I’m calling this a draw. Sharpe disrespected Shaq’s career, but I’m so tired of everyone using the “you’re just trying to get clicks” line. Guess what? Every single person who has a podcast, TV show, column, social media account, whatever, is trying to get clicks. 
Shaq absolutely wanted clicks with his response to Sharpe. So the “trying to stay relevant” argument is weak. 
However, we do love a good media feud and a lengthy retaliation, so we tip our caps to both Sharpe and Shaq for this mess.
2. In Wednesday’s Traina Thoughts, we told you that WFAN’s Boomer Esiason teased that the NFL would be selling its two Christmas Day games this season to Netflix.
Puck’s John Ourand has confirmed the news.
It looks like Netflix will wind up carrying the two NFL games scheduled for December 25, per a bevy of sources.https://t.co/Se6okT3qFe
3. Someone sounded VERY turned on by Luka Dončić scoring 29 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in leading the Dallas Mavericks to a Game 2 win over the Thunder on Thursday. 
You can’t have a better reaction than Dončić did to the NSFW sound that interrupted his postgame press conference.

4. During Thursday’s Astros-Yankees game, former Yankees outfield Paul O’Neill revealed that the residual checks he get for his appearance on Seinfeld come in at $57.
"Do you still get residual checks for being on [Seinfeld]?" - David Cone"Yeah, you know what they are? They're like 57 bucks. It's not big time. It's a good reminder, though, that you were on the show. It's kinda cool." - Paul O'Neill ⚾️📺🎙️💰 pic.twitter.com/mHPTKoAlll
