The song was thought to be Lamar's real response to J. Cole and Drake's respective diss tracks towards him
A TikTok rapper-producer has revealed he created the recent viral Kendrick Lamar diss track.
On the 2023 single ‘First Person Shooter’, Drake compared himself to Michael Jackson as the two are now tied for the most Number One singles on the Billboard charts. Last month, Lamar took jabs at Drake on ‘Like That’ from Metro Boomin and Future’s first joint project, ‘We Don’t Trust You’ by likening himself to Prince – Jackson’s longtime rival. “Prince outlived Mike Jack’ N****, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary,” he rapped.
Drake seemingly responded to Lamar on ‘Push Ups (Drop And Give Me 50)’ – a leaked diss track aimed at Lamar, Metro Boomin, Future and more. “This the bark with the bite, nigga, what’s up? / How the fuck you been steppin’ with a size seven mens on?” he added, alluding to the Californian’s fifth studio album ‘Mr Morale & The Big Steppers’.
Earlier this week, a snippet of a supposed diss track by Lamar surfaced online. In the song – known as ‘One Shot’ – the rapper said: “Utter my name three times in front of your mirror / You hesitate to proceed after you have to reconsider.” This has caused fans to think the lyrics were mostly aimed at J. Cole, who dropped a diss track called ‘7 Minute Drill’ aimed at Lamar in response to ‘Like That’. He soon said that he regretted the choice and removed it from streaming services.

The song turned out to be fake, with the TikToker SyTheRapper taking credit for making the A.I.-generated diss track. He uploaded a video on TikTok where he broke down how he made the track.
“First, you gotta get a beat that sounds like chaos and the world is ending,” he said before confirming that he “cooked up” the instrumental. Sy then showed himself recording the lyrics he wrote for the A.I. diss track.
At the end of the video, SyTheRapper admitted that he “shocked” himself: “I thought it was gon’ sound fake. I thought people were going to be able to tell it was fake, but people did actually think it was real.
“So, I just wanna come out for the record and say that it’s A.I. and it’s not Kendrick’s response. I know Kendrick gon’ come harder than that. I just couldn’t get too disrespectful because I ain’t in a beef.”
I saw people actually believing it so heres the truth its 100% A.I😂 #kendricklamardiss #kendrickdiss #kendrick #kendricklamar #drake #drakediss #dropandgiveme50 #drakepushups #jcole #jcolediss #jcoleapology #rapcivilwar #future #metroboomin #wedonttrustyou #likethat #firstpersonshooter #big3 #rickross #rickrossdiss #asaprocky #viral #fyp #drakeai #hiwhitney

Although Lamar’s “diss track” was fake, Rick Ross has legitimately responded to Drake’s ‘Push Ups’ song. On the latter, the 6God mocked Ross’ age and finances, adding “Every song that made it on the chart, he got from Drizzy.”
So, Ross dropped ‘Champagne Moments’ on which he accused Drake of having a nose job and using ghostwriters. He also directly responded to the Canadian’s claims about needing him to chart: “Let you DM my hoe, but got bitches you can’t / Let you get on my songs, it was good for your face.”
Before ‘Push Ups’ was leaked, Joe Budden revealed that Lamar and Drake’s ongoing rap battle could be “nuclear”.
“Whatever little rap-y shit you thought was going on, it’s not that and something’s coming,” he began. “I have it on good information that both sides went in the booth and came out. And what I’m hearing about both sides is that it’s nuclear. It’s up, up. I’m hearing this from people that can rap. So I wanna come in here and say that speculation time is over. Debate time is over.”
