Ice Cube’s latest album, Man Down, has marked a significant milestone in the legendary rapper’s career, debuting at No. 8 on Billboard’s Top Rap Albums chart dated December 7. 
This achievement comes 14 years after his last solo album graced the top 10. Released on November 22 under Lench Mob/Hitmaker Music Group, the project garnered 20,000 equivalent album units in its first week, according to Luminate. Of these, 15,000 came from pure album sales, making it the second-best-selling rap album of the week, trailing only Kendrick Lamar’s GNX, which tallied 32,000 units.

Streaming also contributed significantly, with Man Down accumulating 13.9 million official on-demand U.S. audio and video streams. This translated into 5,000 streaming units, while track-equivalent activity remained minimal. On the Top Album Sales chart, the album made its presence felt, debuting at No. 9 in the all-genre rankings.
Man Down adds another top-10 entry to Ice Cube’s impressive track record, becoming his fourth solo appearance in the upper echelons of the Top Rap Albums chart. His previous top 10s include 2006’s Laugh Now, Cry Later (No. 2), 2008’s chart-topping Raw Footage, and 2010’s I Am the West (No. 6). Beyond his solo achievements, Ice Cube’s legacy with N.W.A. also shines, with The Best of N.W.A.: The Strength of Street Knowledge peaking at No. 25 on the chart in 2007.
On the broader Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, Man Down debuts at No. 12, marking Ice Cube’s strongest entry since I Am the West reached No. 7 in 2010. This latest release becomes his 17th solo appearance on the list, which includes five No. 1 albums. N.W.A., his iconic group, has also made its mark with six charted titles, led by the 1991 classic Efil4zaggin, which peaked at No. 2.
The album features the current single “It’s My Ego,” which holds steady at No. 28 on the Rhythmic Airplay chart. While its position remains unchanged, the track saw a 39% increase in plays during the latest tracking week, reflecting growing momentum.
With Man Down, Ice Cube reaffirms his enduring influence in the hip-hop world, proving that even after decades, his voice remains as powerful as ever.
