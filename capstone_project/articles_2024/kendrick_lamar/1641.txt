Wyclef Jean weighs in on the escalating tensions between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.
On Monday (May 6) the iconic Fugees member turned to X (formerly known as Twitter) where he shared his perspective on the situation, drawing from his experience “as someone who came up with Battle Rap.”
“Drake Vs Kendrick….. In True Form of Battle Rap, anything goes. The key is to be ready with what’s called a Rebuttal, which means you get to respond back to every Diss track as it comes out,” he began, noting that battle rap was an integral part of the “culture” in his old stomping grounds, “New Jersey and Brooklyn.”
“You get to put facts to any lies that you feel your opponent has cast on you…” he concluded.

Meanwhile, other Hip Hop heavyweights, such as Ice-T, whose previously been embroiled in feuds with the likes of LL Cool J, Soulja Boy, and law enforcement, among others, appears to be less engaged in the events unfolding; suggesting that true hustlers are too busy for gossip.
“I’m sorry if I’m not interested in current Rap Beef or random Male Gossip,” he tweeted on Friday (May 3). “I’m a HUSTLER. I’m only focused on the Bag,” the rapper-turned-actor wrote, taking to X/Twitter.

The ongoing feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake began after the release of “Like That” fresh off Future and Metro Boomin’s album We Don’t Trust You in March. Drake retaliated with “Push Ups,” taking aim not only at Future and Metro Boomin but also at Rick Ross, K. Dot, The Weeknd, and Ja Morant. 
Soon after, Kendrick Lamar retaliated with “Euphoria,” and the exchange of diss tracks between the two had just begun. This list expanded to encompass a plethora of tracks, including Drake’s “Taylor Made Freestyle,” “6:16 In LA,” “Family Matters,” “Meet The Grahams,” “Not Like Us,” and “The Heart Pt. 6.”
With the diss tracks gaining traction on the charts, other rap stars are aligning themselves and eagerly anticipating Kendrick Lamar’s rebuttal to Drake’s “The Heart Pt. 6.”
