“Since the pandemic started, we really pushed ourselves and believed that we controlled our own destiny,” frontman Jacoby Shaddix said in a statement to Billboard.  “We started our own label, hired the right teams, and have found an excellent niche in social media where our music, our personalities, and our fans meet.  A full-service company that understands our vision & can help us navigate this growth in the multi-media landscape is essential.  Next year will bring a lot of surprises!”
The client roster of Wasserman Music features several big names, such as Kenny Chesney, Coldplay, Deftones, Drake, Billie Eilish, Imagine Dragons, Kendrick Lamar, My Chemical Romance, Rise Against, Ed Sheeran, Sum 41, SZA, Turnstile, and more.

The band, which has released 11 studio albums to date, made it big in 2000 with their record Infest peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard albums chart, thanks to their debut single “Last Resort,” which rose to No. 57 on the Hot 100 list, and reigned the Modern Rock chart for seven weeks.
