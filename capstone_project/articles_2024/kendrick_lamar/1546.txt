Pharrell has seemingly joined the bandwagon of artists taking shots at Drake, having likely alluded to The 6 God on new track “Double Life.”
The track is set to be featured on the Despicable Me 4 Soundtrack, which is due out July 3.

On the track he raps: “Lie detector time/ Hey, what are you hiding?/ Nothing wrong being private/ Make sure it ain’t wrong.”
Fans were quick to notice the bars, with one user commenting in a Tweet about the song: “Drake about to stop Adonis from ever watching Despicable Me.”

Another added: “Not he turned his minions song to a diss [crying emoji].”
Others were quick to shut down the rumors.

“I think these lyrics have to do with Gru, not drake [skull emoji],” one wrote; while another said: “Pharrell doing anything to stay relevant after falling off over a decade ago [crying emoji].”

Despicable Me 4 isn’t the only movie Pharrell is affiliated with these days.
Earlier this month, he unveiled the trailer for his upcoming Lego-themed biopic Piece By Piece.

The two-and-a-half-minute trailer opens with a Lego version of Skateboard P speaking with director Morgan Neville and saying: “You know what what would be cool is if we told my story with Lego pieces.”
The director gives a surprised chuckle in response, before Pharrell assures him: “Just be open.”

From there, the video briefly chronicles the Virginia native’s journey from a wide-eyed kid with a passion for music to becoming one of the industry’s premiere hitmakers.
Along the way, it shows him getting his start under the tutelage of Teddy Riley, blending rap and rock as one-third of N.E.R.D and producing hits for the likes of JAY-Z, Snoop Dogg and Justin Timberlake alongside Neptunes production partner Chad Hugo — all of whom voice themselves in the film.

That’s just the tip of the star-studded supporting cast, with cameos also coming from Kendrick Lamar, Busta Rhymes, Pusha T, Timbaland, N.O.R.E., Gwen Stefani and others.
The trailer is largely soundtracked by familiar hits like Pharrell’s “Happy,” Snoop’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot” and N.E.R.D’s “Rockstar,” but Pharrell — as he is known to do with movie projects — has also cooked up new music.

“There are two new compositions. One is made for a specific scene. And the other one is made for a specific scene but tells the story; it’s like my thesis — [which is] that God is the greatest, that awareness, just understanding that that’s the story,” he told Variety.
“The rest of the music is music that Chad [Hugo] and I made together and songs also that I made by myself, and that we produced and wrote for other people. It’s one big fun musical documentary biopic.”
