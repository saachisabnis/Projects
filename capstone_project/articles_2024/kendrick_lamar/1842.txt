West Coast legend Suga Free sat down with DJ Vlad in 2015, shortly after Kendrick Lamar released his second major label album, "To Pimp a Butterfly." The rap veteran reacted to Charlamagne's tweet about hearing a lot of Suga Free's influence on the album. Suga Free agreed with Charlamagne's observation and shouted out Kendrick Lamar for honoring his West Coast roots. Suga Free also brought up a larger conversation about the influence of funk music. "To Pimp a Butterfly" regained rap fans' attention this past week amid J. Cole's diss towards the album in his response to Kendrick's "Like That" verse.
