	One of the best things that resulted from the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar is the latter’s global hit, “Not Like Us.”

	The track continues to be the gift that keeps on giving, as it has now spent a historic 21 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart. “Not Like Us” has now surpassed Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” which previously held the No. 1 title for 20 weeks.

	Following behind the 2019 hit is another LNX tune, “Industry Baby” feat. Jack Harlow, which spent 19 weeks atop the charts. Next is “Hot Boyz” by Missy Elliott, Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” and “Hot line Bling” by Drake (18 weeks), and then Desiigner’s “Panda” and 24kGoldn’s “Mood” at 17 weeks.

	The Compton rapper released the single back in May amid his diss war with Drake and reigned supreme, according to public opinion. The track immediately skyrocketed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and whispers say it’s the biggest rap song of 2024, thus far.

	










	Lyrically, Kenny aimed at Drizzy with bars alleging he’s a sexual predator, a culture vulture, colonizer, and more. And not only does the song send several shots at the OVO boss, it’s also a tune you can turn up to at any function.

	“Not Like Us” has even surpassed 2Pac‘s “Hit ‘Em Up” as the most streamed diss track in Spotify history and could even be considered for a GRAMMY Award next year, according to Grammy CEO Harvey Mason Jr.
