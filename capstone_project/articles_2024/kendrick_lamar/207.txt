Fif’ continued: “He flew me to LA, I came out. I was so bugged out from the experience that I came through the airport with the [bulletproof] vest and shit on … I get there and he’s like, ‘Yo,’ he hugs me.” 50 revealed that Em was so enthusiastic that he was questioning whether the experience was real or staged.
“It felt so good that it couldn’t be right,” he concluded.

In October of 2022, 50 said that despite all of his accolades, Eminem doesn’t get enough credit for his true impact on Hip Hop culture and its global reach.
Fif stopped by Ebro In The Morning and said that the Detroit legend made Hip Hop accessible to more people, thus helping the genre and culture reach new heights.

“I don’t think that they give Em the credit that he deserves,” he explained. “Because, in order for people to embrace something, they have to see where they fit in.”
He continued: “I think part of Eminem’s legacy is the growth of our culture. People wouldn’t buy it if they didn’t see where they fit into it. And he’s there and he’s a legitimate artist because of his journey. When you’re look at 8 Mile, you’re seeing a Black story with a white lead. You seeing poverty, you’re seeing [similar] circumstances. Look at his friends Proof and D-12 and everybody: these are real Hip Hop guys. Which is why he’s a real Hip Hop guy.”
