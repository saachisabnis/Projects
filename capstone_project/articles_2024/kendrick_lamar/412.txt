Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department lands its 17th week atop the Billboard 200, as the publication reports. The album reappeared at the Number One spot last week following the album’s deluxe Anthology version being released on CD and vinyl as an exclusive offering via Target. It earned 240,000 equivalent album units domestically in the week ending Dec. 12, per Luminate, with more than 80 percent of that number (201,000) derived from physical album sales.

TTPD is the 18th album to have spent at least 17 weeks at the top of the chart in its history. It follows Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time, which garnered 19 nonconsecutive weeks at Number One from March 2023 to March 2024. The last woman to hit that milestone is Adele, whose 21 notched 24 nonconsecutive weeks in the top spot in 2011-12.

	Meanwhile, Rosé’s debut solo album, Rosie, bows at Number Three, with the Blackpink member’s record drawing 102,000 equivalent units. Twice’s Strategy debuts at Number Four with 88,000 equivalent units earned, marking the K-pop group’s second Top 10 of the year following their first Number One album, With YOU-th. Kendrick Lamar’s GNX holds steady in the Number Two spot, while the album remains at Number One on Top Streaming Albums for its third consecutive week.

	










Sabrina Carpenter rounds out the Top Five with her previously Number One-bowing album, Short n’ Sweet. She also earned another Top 10 with Fruitcake, initially released in November 2023, reentering the chart at Number 10 after the holiday album became widely available via CD, vinyl, and cassette on Dec. 6. Carpenter is the sixth musician this year to earn at least two albums in the Top 10 at the same time, joining Zach Bryan, Future, Metro Boomin, Swift, and Wallen who also achieved that feat in 2024.
