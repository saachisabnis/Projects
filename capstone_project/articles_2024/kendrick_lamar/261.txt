YFN Lucci was caught up in death rumors on Wednesday, with false claims circulating that the rapper had died in prison. TMZ Hip Hop confirmed the rumors were completely untrue, calling them a “pure fabrication” designed to generate clicks. Lucci’s attorney, Drew Findling—who represented him during his RICO trial that resulted in a 10-year prison sentence—assured fans that Lucci is alive and well.
The false report seemed to play on the emotions stirred by the recent passing of Rich Homie Quan, a former labelmate of YFN Lucci. Unfortunately, many fans contributed to the rumor by sharing the unverified news. This type of behavior is what artists like Kendrick Lamar, Dee-1, and Lecrae have urged the community to avoid, as sharing unconfirmed information can have serious consequences.
Despite his imprisonment, YFN Lucci remains hopeful for an early release. He pleaded guilty to violating the Street Gang and Terrorism Prevention Act and could be out as early as January 2025. In fact, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis stated in July, “The state does not object to the defendant, Rayshawn Bennett, being released,” adding hope to his early release efforts.
Footage from the 2020 shooting that led to his charges has also resurfaced this summer, showing a man being shot from a moving vehicle and later pushed into the street. Despite this, the rumors of his death were entirely baseless, underscoring the dangers of misinformation on social media.
