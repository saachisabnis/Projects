Drake quotes Kendrick Lamar during a recent livestream. 
During his “Drizzmas Giveaway” with Adin Ross last night, Drake showed love to several of his collaborators, including Young Thug, Future, Tory Lanez, and Sexyy Red. While talking about Red, he said, “She is me! She’ll be like, ‘Man, I’m always with you, man. I just be thinking about you, man.’… Shoutout to Sexyy!”
He then quoted a famous line from Kendrick’s track “Euphoria,” laughing as he said, “When I see her, I see two bad ones, n*, what’s up?” He added, “F what y’all talking ’bout… Shoutout Sexyy. W Sexyy in the chat.”

As previously reported, Drake filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) and Spotify. 
Drake accused UMG of defamation, alleging that the company enabled the release of Kendrick Lamar’s diss track, “Not Like Us.” 
“UMG designed, financed, and executed a plan to turn “Not Like Us” into a viral mega-hit,” the filing states. The track reportedly falsely claims Drake is a sex offender.
While speaking with Cam’ron on the Talk With Flee YouTube show, 50 Cent shared his opinion on the lawsuit. 50 speculated that Drake may be trying to stop Kendrick from performing “Not Like Us” during the Super Bowl halftime show.
“I’ve never seen a rap battle end up in court,” 50 shared. “But I think Drake’s team is trying to stop the Super Bowl from causing more damage. If you sue Apple and UMG, both tied to the music at the Super Bowl, they’re already caught up defending themselves.”
