Kendrick Lamar was dying laughing after TDE's Punch cracked some jokes about some newly surfaced photos of him. On Tuesday, May 28, photographer Malick Bodian posted a couple of portraits from a photoshoot for his Chanel campaign earlier this year. The black-and-white images show him seated on a chair with his hand up on his face. After the photos went viral, Terrence "Punch" Henderson texted one photo in particular to Lamar and clowned him. “What you doing dawg?” Punched wrote with a laughing emoji. “I think I’m cute on there man," K. Dot texted back. "Couldn’t resist." 
“What are you doing with them dreamy eyes n***a??” Punch laughed. “I’m crying dawg,” Lamar replied. Earlier this year, Chanel tapped Lamar and his business partner Dave Free's company pgLang to score the fashion house's short film called The Button. The three-minute production helped promote Chanel's spring-summer 2024 haute couture show. Free wrote and directed the film, which stars Naomi Campbell, Margaret Qualley and Anna Mouglalis. The clip also features unreleased music from Lamar. The short film arrived months after Kendrick Lamar officially left his home label Top Dawg Entertainment. Lamar dropped five studio album with the iconic label including 2022's Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. Since then, Lamar has released songs like "The Hillbillies" with Baby Keem through his new imprint pgLang. However, he's currently plotting on releasing his next album through the label. “Even if they fall on their head, they gotta fall on their head, get up, learn from that, and keep moving," Punch said after Lamar left TDE. "You’re concerned always. But it’s still like, ‘I’m proud of you, bro. Do what you do.’ If you need something, the phone is open."
