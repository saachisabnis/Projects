With the recent news of Sean “Diddy” Combs physically assaulting Cassie Ventura in 2016, there has been a bigger spotlight on him than ever before. Even after his apology video was released on May 19, people are steering away from the artist, if not outright disassociating with him.
Another person in the headlines recently is Drake after his rap feud with Kendrick Lamar. Now, Combs and Drake are being named in the same sentence after an old interview with The Game began recirculating. In it, he spoke about Combs allegedly setting up the Toronto rapper to possibly attack him in Los Angeles back in the day. The Game was on “VladTV” when he spoke about the alleged setup.
“Him and Diddy were beefing, and they had a little beef over something in Miami,” The Game said.
DJ Vlad then mentioned that Diddy allegedly assaulted Drake, and it may have been over Drake’s “Started From the Bottom” beat.
“When I think about ‘Started From the Bottom’, I don’t know what Diddy would’ve [done] with that beat. It’s like a Drake beat,” The Game said.
The Game then mentioned that calls were being made in Los Angeles about where Drake was.
“There were calls going around LA and it was like ‘Drake’s here, Drake’s there, who would run up on him.’ I’m not saying it came from Diddy directly, but L.A. gets tricky,” The Game said. “When there are beefs and they are here, no matter who it is, there are certain people that get called — and I’m one of those people. I had provided Drake with a little information. I don’t know where it came from, but that’s like my brother. So I hit him and told him ‘This is what it is. I got you, we over here, and I’m pretty heavy, so we straight.'”
