21 Savage & Summer Walker’s “prove it” completes its ascent to #1 on this week’s Mediabase rhythmic radio chart.
Up one place from last week’s position, “prove it” earns #1 thanks to the ~6,244 spins it received during the October 20-26 tracking period. The count tops last week’s mark by 1,082 spins.
A two-place rise concurrently brings Kendrick Lamar’s enduring “Not Like Us” up to #2.
