The 66th annual Grammy Awards take place this Sunday, Feb. 4, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Beyond mainstream heavy hitters like Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and Billie Eilish, this year’s awards show also honors quite a few Austin locals.
The obvious example is Black Pumas, who are up for Best Rock Performance for “More Than a Love Song.” Though only two studio albums deep, the nod marks the band’s seventh Grammy nomination overall; their self-titled debut, its subsequent deluxe edition, and a live album received consecutive nominations in 2020, 2021, and 2022. 
Other Grammy-recognized longtime Austinites include Willie Nelson, in the running for Best Bluegrass thanks to his LP Bluegrass, and Ruthie Foster, whose album Healing Time is up for Best Contemporary Blues. 
On the classical side, the Miró Quartet, part of the local choral ensemble Conspirare, is nominated for Best Choral Performance for the 17-track compilation The House of Belonging. Should they win, the award will go to conductor and Conspirare founder Craig Hella Johnson, a nine-time Grammy nominee and one-time winner. 
It’s not just local musicians who stand the chance to be celebrated at “music’s biggest night.” Austin producer Debra Davis, who’s worked on livestreams for the Austin City Limits festival and various CMT productions, is among the team that helped make Kendrick Lamar’s The Big Steppers Tour concert film, nominated for Best Music Film. 
And one wildcard: Paul Simon, who now lives in Wimberley with his wife Edie Brickell, is up for Best Folk Album for his LP Seven Psalms. He even recorded the album on his Hill Country ranch, which means Central Texans can officially claim him as one of our own. 
The Grammys will be broadcast live on CBS on Sunday, Feb. 4, at 7pm CT, and streamed to Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers. The majority of awards will be presented during the Grammys premiere ceremony, which starts at 2:30pm CT the same day and will stream live on the Recording Academy's YouTube channel and at live.grammy.com.
