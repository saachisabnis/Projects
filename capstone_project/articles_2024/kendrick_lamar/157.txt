ScHoolboy Q and A$AP Rocky were once going to make an album together, but it never happened for one simple yet strange reason.
Fresh off the release of his latest album Blue Lips, Q appeared on N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN’s Drink Champs this past weekend and was asked about the collaborative project.

The TDE rapper confirmed that he and Rocky had discussions about it, but blamed their poor communication skills on it fizzling out.
“Yeah, we talked about it but I mean, me and him just ghost each other so much, bro,” he said. “Like, I’ll be looking for him, I can’t find him. He’ll be looking for me. I see it, I’ll be like, ‘Bruh, I’ll call you tomorrow.’

“He got Rihanna, bruh, so sometimes I gotta get him back. ‘Alright, you ghosted me for a week, I’ma have to ghost you for a week. You gotta wait a week now too.'”
On a more serious note, ScHoolboy Q also revealed he was recently hanging out with A$AP Rocky and was treated to an early preview of what he’s been cooking up.

“That’s my boy,” he said. “I was just at his house looking at the new art he was making and coming up with. He cold. You know, he’s always doing clothes, videos and music, so he was just letting me see all the art he was working on pretty much.”

ScHoolboy Q and A$AP Rocky have collaborated numerous times over the years on songs such as “Brand New Guy,” “Hands on the Wheel,” “PMW (All I Really Need)” and “Electric Body.”
During an interview with BlowHipHopTV in 2012, Rocky spoke about discovering Q’s work and meeting him for the first time.

“I was a fan of ScHoolboy Q. I wanted him to be on my album. I always wanted to work with the n-gga before shit blew up,” he said.
“I was working on LiveLoveA$AP. In the midst of it, I got my name up a little bit so I started to meet people who knew people who knew people some way, somehow.”

He added: “Fortunately, he was a cool guy and wanted to work with me, because this was before ‘Peso’ blew up and before ‘Purple Swag’ really blew up. That n-gga was trill, that’s why I fucked with that n-gga.
“And I fucked with Kendrick [Lamar], too. I like what them n-ggas is doing over there. There’s a lot of positive energy from the West Side over there. We fuck with them n-ggas.”
