Grammy-winning artist Drake has recently expanded his impressive real estate portfolio with the acquisition of The Inn at Dos Brisas, a luxurious 313-acre ranch located in Brenham, Texas. This strategic move comes after his notable rap battle with Kendrick Lamar, highlighting Drake’s continuous momentum in both his music career and business ventures.
In a deal that closed at $15 million, Drake has secured a property that boasts a sprawling 14,300-square-foot main house, complete with haciendas and casitas for guests. The ranch, which is a two-hour drive south of Dallas, is not just a residential estate but a retreat that offers a variety of high-end amenities.
Real estate agent Tonya Currie has described the property as a “rare legacy ranch” that presented an unparalleled opportunity for the right buyer — a role Drake has confidently stepped into.
Drake took to Instagram last September to announce his new acquisition, sharing his excitement with fans. In a playful video, he teased the idea of a new chapter in his life, hinting at embracing the country lifestyle and even joking about renaming a part of the ranch to “Lover Boy Lake,” in reference to his music.
Before becoming part of Drake’s collection, The Inn at Dos Brisas was owned by Houston tech mogul Doug Bosch and his wife Jennifer. Initially a family retreat, the property was transformed into a resort in 2004 and operated as a part of the prestigious Relais & Châteaux group. However, it closed in 2022 due to the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
With this acquisition, Drake not only adds to his real estate empire but also preserves a piece of Texas heritage, ensuring that the legacy of The Inn at Dos Brisas continues under new stewardship.
