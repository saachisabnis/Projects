Kendrick Lamar is certainly winning everything right now. From rap battles, to streaming numbers, to awards, he’s one of the most acclaimed artists of our time. The real question is do all these accomplishments equal dollars?
According to XXL, one of the Compton native’s most well-known songs is a big part of that success. With 686 million streams on Spotify and 173 million views on YouTube, “Alright” has been named Spotify’s No. 1 hip-hop song of the streaming era. When you consider all the hits that have been released in the 2000s, this is a massive achievement.
When you combine all those streams with his successful 2023 “Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers” tour and his album sales, the “Not Like Us” rapper’s net worth is somewhere between $75-100 million, depending on which source you go with. As final figures still roll in from the feud, a firm estimation of his net worth is difficult to find.
This is obviously not nearly as much as contemporaries like Drake, The Weeknd, or Bad Bunny, but Kendrick also doesn’t release new music or tour at the same rate they do. He’s concerned with artistry and creativity, not quantity.
Let’s be honest: If he wanted to, Kendrick could drop hit albums all the time. He chooses to do things his own way, which is one of the reasons his fans love him so much.
Speaking of Drake, Lamar’s much-talked about feud with the Canadian superstar brought in around $725,000 for the new tracks, per SportsKeeda. Plus, the publicity led to a bump in streams for his previously released music.
In addition to the money he made off the feud, there’s also the currency he gained as one of the best rappers in the game. Based on how hard he went in on Toronto’s favorite son, it doesn’t seem like anyone will be calling out Kendrick anytime soon.
We don’t know what’s next for Kendrick Lamar, but we hear Broadway shows can be a great revenue source if they become hits.
