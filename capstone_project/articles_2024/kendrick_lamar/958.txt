	One time wasn’t enough for Future and Metro Boomin as the Atlanta rapper-producer duo are ready to spin the block again later this month. 

	Metro Boomin shared a menacing trailer for the second serving of their double album titled We Still Don’t Trust You on Thursday (April 4). 

	The cinematic clip features Young Metro and Pluto draped in white suits while walking around a dark room. Matching luxury cars flank the pair before stunt doubles continue to fill the alley. Everything comes to a close by revealing the project’s April 12 release date.

	“Job’s not finished 4/12/24 @1future,” Metro captioned the clip on social media.

	Young Metro also made sure to clarify on X that this project isn’t some sort of deluxe edition and should be looked at as a completely new idea separate from the first.

	Metro Boomin and Future took the hip-hop world by storm with their We Don’t Trust You album, which topped the Billboard 200 with 251,000 total album-equivalent units in the week ending March 28, per Luminate. It’s the biggest sales week for any album thus far in 2024.

	“ALL PURELY OFF STREAMS NO PHYSICALS NO BUNDLES JUST GREAT MUSIC AND EMBRACE FROM YOU ALL!! THANK YOU!!!! #WETRUSTYOU #WEDONTTRUSTTHEM,” Metro wrote on X after the project reached No. 1.

	Album standout “Like That” featuring Kendrick Lamar also soared to top the Billboard Hot 100 thanks in part to K. Dot’s incendiary bars scorching his “Big 3” running mates Drake and Future. 

	“Like That” ended up drawing 59.6 million streams and 5.6 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 9,000 in the week ending March 28, according to Luminate. The 59.6 million streams are the most for a track in one week since Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” tallied 59.7 million in its second week (Feb. 4, 2023).

	Gear up for We Still Don’t Trust You by watching the trailer below. Look for the album to arrive on April 12.
