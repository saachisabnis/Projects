Kendrick Lamar is reportedly working on a new tour for 2025. On Sunday night, October 6, Bloomberg published a report about Coachella's future including its prospects for next year's headliners. The festival's promoter Paul Tollett confirmed that he attempted to book K.Dot and Rihanna to lead the lineup for next year. Unfortunately, both international superstars declined the offer. According to the report, Lamar turned down the opportunity to return as the headliner due to his packed schedule. Not only is he set to headline Super Bowl LIX, but he's also preparing to embark on his own "major stadium" tour. 
Kendrick Lamar's last string of shows was "The Big Steppers Tour" in 2022. He launched the tour just two months after he released his Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers album. Lamar kicked off the show in Oklahoma City and hit up 34 cities across the U.S. with openers Baby Keem and Tanna Leone before he closed out in his hometown of Los Angeles. They also hit up Europe, Australia and New Zealand as part of the international leg of the tour. As of this report, neither Kendrick Lamar nor his team have confirmed the plans for a tour. If he does hit the road next year, it would most likely begin shortly after he headlines the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show. The tour could also coincide with his forthcoming album, which had been in the works well before his smash hit "Not Like Us" impacted the world. So far, a release date for the album has not been confirmed. However, with all this talk about the Super Bowl and an alleged tour, we could get more information about it soon enough.
