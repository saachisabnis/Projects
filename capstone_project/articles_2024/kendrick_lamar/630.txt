Top this, Drake. Kendrick Lamar has landed a 16,200-square-foot mansion in Brentwood for more than $40 million.
The Pulitzer-prize winning rapper bought the Farmhouse-style estate at 1707 Westridge Road, in Lower Mandeville Canyon, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources. The seller is a trust tied to Viet Dinh and his wife, Jennifer Ashworth.
Should it close, the off-market deal will rank among the priciest in Los Angeles this year. 
Dinh, the former chief legal and policy officer at Fox, bought the nine-bedroom, 15-bathroom estate in 2019 for $19.5 million.
The 0.8-acre property includes the eight-bedroom Napa Valley-inspired Modern Farmhouse built in 2018 of stone, marble and reclaimed wood, plus a 925-square-foot guest house.
Highlights include a wine cellar, gym, media room, spa and an elevator, according to the five-year-old listing. The Philip Vertoch-designed home has distant ocean views and an outside pool. It’s not clear if the Dinhs had renovated the property since.
Lamar, known for such hits as “Humble” and “Alright,” has made headlines for his feud with rapper Drake, with the stars exchanging diss tracks. 
Brokers Cindy Ambuehl and Morgan Trent of Christie’s International Real Estate and Mark Norton of Palm Realty Boutique were involved in the sale.
Dinh, who served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General under President George W. Bush, was the Fox attorney in an ill-fated strategy that resulted in a $787.5 million settlement agreement in favor of Dominion Voting Systems.
