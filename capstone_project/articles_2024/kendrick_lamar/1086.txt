Shaquille O'Neal has fans talking after he took a hilarious jab at Drake over the weekend. On Saturday, June 22, the NBA legend and rapper took to his Instagram Story and shared a photoshopped photo of him and the Toronto artist. The digitally altered image shows Shaq in a bathing suit with his arms around a woman in a bikini who also has Drizzy's face. His post also has Metro Boomin's "BBL Drizzy" playing in the background. The original photo was taken five years ago while the celebrity DJ was on vacation in Spain. According to Bossip, the woman is model Danielle Dilworth. 
It's not clear why Shaq took a shot at Drake on social media. The two have been cordial with one another in the past. Drizzy referenced Shaq on songs like "Used To," and the player-turned-analyst previously freestyled for the Grammy award-winning rapper while on "Inside The NBA" in 2016. So far, Shaq hasn't given any context to the confusing post, but it could have something to do with Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef. The Hall of Famer was one of numerous NBA stars who attended Kendrick Lamar's "The Pop Out" show in Los Angeles last week. Shaq was in the crowd alongside James Harden, Demar Derozen, Russell Westbrook, and others who pulled up in support of K. Dot. Shaq recently discussed the high-profile rap battle with Ice Cube. The "No Vaseline" rapper joined the Big Podcast With Shaq and weighed in with his thoughts about the beef. Both Cube and Shaq ultimately agreed Kendrick came out on top. Revisit the episode below.
