Hip-hop fans want J. Cole to apologize. Again.
Many fans were dismayed when the North Carolina rapper backed out of the most consequential rap beef of the modern era that involved Kendrick Lamar and Drake. And now fans are flogging J. Cole for producing what fans call a listless and putrid verse on Cash Cobain’s “Grippy” song.
Rap aficionados were particularly confounded and perturbed by this bar:
“Now she in my phone with a nickname/ It’s, it’s, it’s, hmm/ Grippy.”

One fan ordered J. Cole to take this verse back, just like he did with his diss song of Kendrick Lamar. 
“This message is for Jermaine Cole. Please take the ‘Grippy’ song back like you took ‘Seven Minute Drill’ back. It’s not too late,” she said in the comments section of HipHopDX. 
Another fan was offended that J. Cole would dare offer such a lackluster bar. 
“Y’all know how J. Cole has been teasing ‘The Fall Off’ dropping? What if bro was talking about himself the whole time?”

Also in the song, which is a reworking of Cash Cobain’s single “Dunk Contest,” J. Cole spits this on wax which was also subjected to condemnation:
“Grippy, I call her that ’cause it’s grippy/ She thinkin’ it hip, she a hippie/ And she thinkin’ of lips, she gon’ lick me/ And she sendin’ a flick when she hit me/ With a kissin’ emoji, she miss me/ When she see me, she say she gon’ strip me.”
“J Cole’s verse on that Cash Cobain song was f—–g atrocious,” one person surmised.
