Terence Crawford being confused with Kendrick Lamar on the UFC broadcast today… pic.twitter.com/NJMFcP7weY
It would appear that whoever was running the UFC 306 broadcast last Sat. night (Sept. 14) at The Sphere in Las Vegas can’t tell the difference between decorated boxing champion Terence Crawford and Grammy-award winning rapper Kendrick Lamar.
Or maybe they can and just wanted to score some cheap laughs.
Crawford was featured during a crowd shot at UFC 306 but the accompanying graphic labeled him as Lamar, drawing widespread criticism (and widespread laughs) on social media — though it doesn’t sound like “Bud” is taking it personally.

“It was funny because everybody was texting me and hitting me up,” Crawford told TMZ Sports. “I wasn’t in tune with the broadcast. I just ... not taking any notice of it, and then I started seeing the pictures coming to my phone and everybody laughing, like ‘Oh man, they got you messed up.’ And then I just took a little chuckle at it. To be honest, I think it was intentionally done, just for laughters, because how can you get us mixed up? But all in all, it was funny to me.”
Perhaps not as funny to UFC CEO Dana White.
“I was talking to Terence Crawford ... that was pretty bad,” White said at the UFC 306 post-fight press conference (watch it here). “He did kinda look like Kendrick Lamar, though. So when I said we had a flawless production, I take that back.”

“Shoutout to my girl Rihanna, she said she don’t appreciate y’all calling me Kendrick Lamar,” Crawford wrote on Instagram. “Y’all better show some respect for the P4P KING.”
