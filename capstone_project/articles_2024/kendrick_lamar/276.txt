Touré strongly critiqued DJ Vlad's view that the rivalry between Kendrick Lamar and Drake was close. He dismissed the idea, calling Vlad "pathetic" for suggesting any parity in their artistry. According to Touré, Kendrick stands in a league of his own, weaving complex narratives with deep, enduring impact, unlike Drake’s more mainstream, sentimental approach. Highlighting a poignant observation by a London fan, Touré emphasized that while Drake communicates with his audience, Kendrick speaks directly to Drake, challenging the core of his artistry. Touré argued that Drake’s work, which he compared to R&B more than hip-hop, couldn’t match Kendrick's gravitas in the rap arena. He hailed Kendrick as a monumental M.C. of this generation, making it clear that any comparison to Drake was misguided. Touré concluded by affirming Kendrick’s place among hip-hop's all-time greats, suggesting his artistic depth demands respect, irrespective of personal preference.
