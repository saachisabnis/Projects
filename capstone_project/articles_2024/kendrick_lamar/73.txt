Christmas is fast approaching, so what better time is there to put together a naughty and nice list for the NFL, at least as it pertains to fantasy football.
Otherwise, this column would read like a tabloid or a police blotter.
Naughty
Nice
Happy Holidays to you and yours!
Devising the perfect Daily Fantasy Sports strategy for the NFL can be a challenge, which is why I’m here weekly to assist.
On DraftKings, it’s important to remember you’re playing full-point PPR with bonuses if a player surpasses 300 passing yards, 100 rushing yards or 100 receiving yards.
Here is my optimal lineup for Sunday’s NFL $2.25 million Fantasy Football Millionaire contest, but it can be utilized as a foundation in other games and platforms.
All prices listed are courtesy of DraftKings with a $50,000 budget.
The Optimal Lineup has netted $207.86 this season, so I’m in the red $67.14 with an average score of 132.44 points through 15 weeks.
Week 1: 90.16
Week 2: 144.38
Week 3: 100.38
Week 4: 180.78
Week 5: 147.14
Week 6: 126.72
Week 7: 132.98
Week 8: 114.84
Week 9: 168.48
Week 10: 97.16
Week 11: 138.58
Week 12: 109.78
Week 13: 106.92
Week 14: 187.28
Week 15: 140.96
QB: Caleb Williams, Bears ($5,500)
Williams is the overall QB9 since Week 12 completing 62.1% of his passes for 921 yards and eight TD passes with no interceptions and a passer rating of 100.3 in the last four games. He’s also added 102 yards on 18 carries over that span, which could come into play against Detroit’s depleted defense that almost exclusively plays man coverage.
RB: Saquon Barkley, Eagles ($8,300)
If we’re swallowing the Gibbs chalk — he’s going to be 45-60% rostered in nearly every GPP — and let me be crystal clear, you should, then we need to find a way to differentiate our lineup. One way is shoehorning Barkley in, while most of the field might find it too cost-prohibitive. Barkley needs to average about 140 yards per game to break Eric Dickerson’s long-standing single-season rushing record, and the Commanders have struggled mightily against the run.
RB: Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions ($7,500)
I usually make 50-to-75 lineups, and Gibbs will be in every single one this week. In three games without David Montgomery last season, Gibbs averaged 23 touches per game and finished as the RB24, RB3 and RB1.
WR: D.J. Moore, Bears ($5,700)
Best case scenario here is the Lions force Chicago into a pass-heavy game script by utilizing Gibbs, like they did on Thanksgiving, and Williams peppers his receivers with targets. Moore caught eight of 16 targets for 97 yards and a TD on Turkey Day.
WR: Keenan Allen, Bears ($5,300)
Allen finished with five receptions on eight targets for 73 yards and two TDs on Thanksgiving. Both Moore (WR7) and Allen (WR9) have been top-10 options in PPR formats since Week 12.
WR: Kendrick Bourne, Patriots ($3,400)
New England is a 14-point underdog at Buffalo, and Bourne has turned into one of Drake Maye’s favorite targets with at least three receptions in five straight games. It’ll be cold, but there shouldn’t be much precipitation.
TE: Sam LaPorta, Lions ($4,700)
Stacking Gibbs with LaPorta is another way to differentiate our lineup. LaPorta will be significantly less popular this week, and I’m anticipating him playing a significant role in the red zone and goal-to-go situations with Montgomery sidelined.
FLEX: James Cook, Bills ($7,000)
Buffalo is a heavy favorite, which should lead to an increased workload, in what could be a “smash” opportunity for Cook against the Patriots’ very bad run defense.
DST: Tennessee Titans ($2,600)
The Colts’ Anthony Richardson is currently projected to be the most rostered quarterback on the main slate. Playing the opposing defense against a chalky QB is a good way to gain leverage on the field.
