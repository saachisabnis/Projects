People just don’t want the feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar to be over, as seemingly every week, someone makes a new claim about either artist.
Over the weekend, music manager Wack 100 claimed during a conversation on the Clubhouse App that Drake is attempting to ruin the Compton rapper’s performance at the 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans, saying, “[Drake] served a cease-and-desist [to] Kendrick Lamar so he can’t perform ‘Not Like Us.’”
He added, “He’s trying to get the NFL to restrict Kendrick.”
Listen to the entire clip below:
Despite Wack 100's allegation, it seems that none of what he said was true, as a rep for the 6 God told Rolling Stone, “There was never any intention or plan to send a cease-and-desist to anyone.”
On Monday, a day after it was reported that Drizzy never took any legal action, Wack 100 made an appearance on DJ Akademiks stream and admitted that the claims he made were false, saying that he was simply reading a tweet someone posted.
Although Wack’s claims have been debunked, this isn’t the first time Drake has been accused of sending a cease-and-desist to multiple artists this year. On “Euphoria,” Lamar’s first diss track aimed at the OVO artist, he rapped, “Trying to cease-and-desist on a ‘Like That’ record/Ho what you ain’t like that record?’Back to Back’ I like that record/Ima get back to that for the record.”
Drake responded shortly after on “Family Matters,” saying, “A cease and desist is for hoes/Can’t listen to lies that come out of your mouth.”
Rick Ross also claimed on “Champagne Moments,” that Drake sent a cease-and-desist letter to French Montana for an unreleased song that featured all three MCs.
