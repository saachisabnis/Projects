"If you act like a pu**y, people going to treat you like a pu**y."

Suge Knight has declared Kendrick Lamar as the victor in his brief lyrical exchange with J. Cole, who recently issued an apology for his diss song, “7 Minute Drill.”

	Knight, a fellow Compton native, weighed in on the topic in a snippet from an upcoming episode of his Collect Call podcast, saluting Kendrick and affirming his status as a bonafide neighborhood hero. 

	“West Coast, stand up,” the incarcerated rap mogul said in the clip. “It’s a victory. Kendrick Lamar is a real muthaf**ka from the hood. He really from there and everybody going to ride with him.”

	










	The Death Row Records founder also chided J. Cole for seemingly waving the white flag with his apology and not standing behind his words, a sentiment similar to a number of figures within the Hip-Hop community.

	“J. Cole, you supposed to say what you mean and mean what you say,” Knight began. “To be the best, you gotta beat the best. This is a contact sport. As we used to say back in the day, if you don’t want to be a gangsta rapper, go be R&B.”

	The 58-year-old went one step further, equating the North Carolina native’s show of humility to a “slave” mentality and warning that his retreat from confrontation could work against him in the long-run. J. Cole, with that attitude, we’d still be in slavery… I’m going to tell you like I tell my son, if you act like a pu**y, people going to treat you like a pu**y.”
