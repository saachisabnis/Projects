On Monday, June 24, Chris Patrick shared a photo of himself with a caption that reads, “Anotha project almost done.” If his next project is almost done, Chris Patrick must be mentioned among the hardest working MCs in Hip-Hop today.
In April, Chris Patrick ended a nearly two-year layoff with the release of a nine-track project called The Calm. Earning co-signs from The Breakfast Club’s Nyla Symone and Rolling Stone‘s Andre Gee, The Calm is one of the most dynamic releases of the year. The 25-minute endeavor kicks off with “Numb,” a 169-second diary entry in which the New Jersey native pours his emotions into the microphone as if it were his therapist. Gliding along the Alex Vaughn-sample centered in Boi Yanel’s production, the emerging MC opens up about losing close friends, watching his grandmother pass away, struggling to pay rent and finding the strength to push through. In the end, it may garner the attention of a “Euphoria” or a “Blueslides,” but it’s undeniably one of the best displays of rapping thus far in 2024. Alongside “Numb,” The Calm delivers the equally introspective “Take Time For Yourself,” the aggressive “Da Beam” and the melodic “You.” By the end of the 25-minute experience, listeners are left thinking on thing; I really hope he makes his dreams come true.
Heading into the second half of the year, a new Chris Patrick could slide in alongside a number of highly anticipated releases from more established acts, including Wale, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, Common and Rakim. Until we learn more about what this project entails, check out the “Take Time For Yourself” video below.
