Kid Cudi‘s Man on the Moon trilogy remains the crown jewel in his catalog for many fans, but he might be starting another album series.
While interacting with his 2.6 million followers on X on Sunday (March 3), the Cleveland rapper teased making a sequel to his 2013 LP Indicud after one fan called it “flawless.”

Cudi himself had similarly high praise for the project, which marked his first entirely self-produced effort, crowning it one of his “greatest achievements.”
“Idk what was in my soul at the time, Idk if I was possessed by something haha but that is truly one of my greatest achievements,” he wrote.
“First #2 record. All by myself. I am so fuckin happy u dig that one. Maybe I produce another record?? Could be fun. Indicud part 2. Should I?”
The fan’s post prompted Kid Cudi to listen to Indicud for the first time in a while and live tweet his reactions, at one point admitting he “[couldn’t] believe [he] made this.”
“Listening to Red Eye. Just lettin the album play,” he said. “Wow. I cant believe I made this shit haha I havent listened in years. How [the] songs go right into each other. Very happy time. Man, I snapped.”

He also praised Too $hort‘s guest verse on “Girls” and called the collaboration a “dream come true.”
“Omg, he snappped,” he wrote. “That was a dream come true. @TooShort. thank u brother, for ur support and love. We gotta rock again for old times sake. For the bay and cleveland.”
Turning his attention to the production, Cudi later called “Lord of the Sad and Lonely” one of his favorite beats he’s made and credited Timbaland with inspiring some of his choices behind the boards.
“U know how the beats sometimes switches up at the end or a new element comes in?? I got that from Timbaland,” he wrote with a winking face emoji.

The “Day ‘N’ Nite” rapper also spoke highly of his relationship with Hit-Boy, who provided Cudi with the synth sound he used on “Red Eye.”
“That synth was Hit Boy tho, it was a synth he made I heard and lost my shit over during one of Ye’s sessions back in 2010 at the Mercer,” he wrote.
“When I was workin on indicud I asked if I could use it, and my brother let me run w it. Hit was always a good dude. Got a funny story about when we met in my book.”
Released in April 2013, Indicud debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with roughly 139,000 units in its first week. It has since been certified gold by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).
In addition to Too $hort, the 18-song project featured appearances from Hip Hop heavyweights like Kendrick Lamar, RZA and A$AP Rocky, as well as Father John Misty, HAIM and Michael Bolton.

A potential Indicud sequel isn’t the only project in the pipeline for Kid Cudi. Despite previously hinting at retirement, he recently announced that his next album is almost finished and set to be released in 2026.
