This kid doesn’t know it now, but he got a valuable autograph.
Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce spent time recently with former NBA player Chandler Parsons, and they played golf and visited Parsons’ family.
Parsons and his wife, Haylee, welcomed a son, Chrome, in late October, and he’s apparently going to call Kelce “Uncle Trav.”
Haylee Parsons shared photos on her Instagram story of Kelce with Chrome, and at one point Kelce put his John Hancock on the cranial helmet being worn by Chrome.
“Making cranial helmets cool!’, Haylee wrote. She also shared this message on another photo: “Uncle Trav’s in town!”
Here are photos of Kelce’s special visit with Chrome, and these are cute.
John’s Hopkins noted that cranial helmets are “used to gently correct the shape of babies’ skulls over time. Newborn babies’ skulls are soft plates with spaces between them. As the baby grows, these plates grow, gradually harden and knit together.”
There was also a noteworthy moment on the links.
Chandler Parsons tried to throw Kelce off his golf game by playing “Bad Blood” by Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift (and featuring Kendrick Lamar).
Instead, Kelce crushed the shot.
