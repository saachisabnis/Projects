	Future is having a banner year and has no plans of slowing down. The Atlanta rapper took to X early Wednesday (May 8) to announce Mixtape Pluto is back and that he’s dropping something on Friday, May 10.

MIXTAPE PLUTO

	Both of Future’s recent albums alongside producer Metro Boomin went No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and their song “Like That” featuring Kendrick Lamar, which set off the biggest rap battle in decades, reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. This will be his first mixtape since 2018’s Wrld on Drugs with the late Juice Wrld, and his first solo tape since 2016’s Purple Reign.

	Future and Metro headed up the Rap Game Sinister Six that seemingly neutralized Drake, with Kendrick Lamar finishing the job over the weekend (for now, at least). There’s no word if this mixtape will continue the Drake onslaught, but the Canadian rapper did mention Future’s name in his diss record “Family Matters,” saying, “Pluto s–t make me sick to my stomach, we ain’t never really been through it.”

	There is some speculation, though, that Future is releasing this tape to compete with Gunna’s new album, One of Wun, dropping the same day, and Gunna might be feeling the same way. The Atlanta rapper seemingly responded to Future on X.
Turn this shit bac up Notch……!
Fuc What These boys talkin bout 🗣️

	Rap beef seems to be in the air, which is great as long as it stays on wax. Competition is healthy for the game. Many fans on X, however, are torn between having to pick a side if this beef is indeed true. Check out what some had to say below.
