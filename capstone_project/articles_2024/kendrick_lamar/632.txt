Kendrick Lamar‘s “Not Like Us” music video was shot in Compton on Saturday (June 22), with an all-star cast and plenty of sheriff deputies. The shoot follows the King of the West Coast bringing together L.A. hip-hop at the Ken & Friends Juneteenth celebration held at the Kia Forum on Wednesday (June 19). Kendrick performed the hit song five times in a row at the concert.  
“Not Like Us” is a Drake diss track that Lamar released in May. DJ Mustard’s Produced track has reached #1 on the Billboard charts. The track would accumulate several new record-breaking achievements in Lamar’s career.

TMZ broke the news on Friday that the Pulitzer Prize-winning recording artist enlisted heavy law enforcement presence for the music video shoot. Clips of the video shoot flooded social media on Saturday, with Kendrick surrounded by a massive crowd of people from various locations throughout Compton. Kendrick Lamar was born and raised in the area, and his debut album, Good Kid M.A.A.d City, focuses on his upbringing in the place that made N.W.A., The Game, and more. 
The music video will feature a lot of celebrities, including DJ Mustard, YG, and so many more. Similar to the Pop Out concert that brought out Dr. Dre, E-40, Tyler, The Creator, Roddy Richh, and Ty Dolla $ign. 
But perhaps the biggest surprise of all is the appearance of viral podcaster Bobbi Althoff. A viral clip of Althoff hanging out with YG appeared on social media early Saturday morning, adding an unexpected twist to the already star-studded music video.
Althoff’s appearance in the music video may be a shot at Drake, as the two developed a beef following their podcast interview. The interview would eventually be removed from YouTube for unknown reasons.
