Kendrick Lamar is not someone that RadioU has mentioned before but it came as a surprise to us that he name-drops Lecrae in his most recent snippet of a song on Instagram this week. In the song, he references the GRAMMY-award-winning rapper by saying, “Sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do,” right after asking God for forgiveness in the song.
