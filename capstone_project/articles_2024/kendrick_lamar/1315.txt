Boosie delved into the ongoing tensions between hip-hop heavyweights Drake and Kendrick Lamar. Drawing parallels to historical beefs in the rap game, Boosie reminisced about the infamous feud between Tupac and Biggie, suggesting that modern beefs have shifted focus. Vlad claimed that Tupac set a new bar by publicly admitting to sleeping with Faith Evans, Biggie's wife, a move that was revolutionary at the time. Boosie argued that the contemporary battles, including the one between Drake and Kendrick, are less about rap and more about personal attacks and digging up dirt. According to Boosie, these feud tactics are dangerous because they invite reactions from street guys, who might take drastic actions without the artists' direct involvement.
