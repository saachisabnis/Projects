During this 2024 election season, former President Obama has been seen in the public eye more than any other political figure (besides Kamala Harris and Donald Trump). But he hasn’t just talked about getting to the polls and voting — he’s made time to give his two cents on pop culture.
During an appearance on “Deep Cut with Vic Blends,” Obama was asked about the “Big 3” of hip-hop — Drake, J.Cole and Kendrick Lamar — and if the latter has taken the top spot among them.
 “Kendrick is a friend of mine,” Obama said. “I’ve been knowing him for a long time. He actually performed at the White House…I do think that Kendrick has a unique status right now, not just because of this summer. He’s not just gifted; he’s serious about the message he tries to… he digs deep into himself. He digs deep.”
He continued, “When we get together, he wants to talk about fatherhood… those are the questions he’s talking about.”
Vic Blends made sure to get in a word about J. Cole since they’re both from Fayetteville, N.C. Obama gave him his props, saying, “J. [Cole] is very high on the list.”
Obama fails to mention Drake but is clearly refers to his rap battle with K. Dot. 
Watch the entire interaction below:
Obama talking about the current state of hip-hop shouldn’t surprise anyone: Did we forget about the time Obama referred to Kanye West as a “jackass” when discussing his moment with Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Awards? Just last week, during a Harris/Walz rally in Detroit, the former president rapped the opening lyrics to Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” to hype the crowd up.
Even years before the Kendrick-Drake beef, he said that the Compton MC would win in a rap battle.
