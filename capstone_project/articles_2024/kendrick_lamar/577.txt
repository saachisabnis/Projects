Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud looks like a generational talent after winning Rookie of the Year and being named to the Pro Bowl last season. If Stroud stays on this track, he’ll probably be able to claim plenty of firsts during his career.
One of those firsts by Stroud is his connection as a star QB to a legendary hip-hop family. At age 12, living in Southern California, Stroud played in Snoop Dogg’s Youth Football League.
While Stroud had to put in many years of hard work to make it to where he’s landed, it may not have been the same without the iconic rapper’s youth league.
"It's special because [Stroud] is exactly what we breed kids to be," Snoop Dogg said, per ESPN’s DJ Bien-Aim. "... Good students, good athletes, respecting their elders, their parents and being a great listener. C.J. was a great listener. That's why he's translating on that football field into a great leader."
We hear about coaching family trees all the time, especially in the NFL. However, this one is unique with Stroud’s branch leading back to Snoop Dogg which then leads back to super producer Dr. Dre.
Those two hip-hop heavyweights are enough to get anyone’s attention and then you realize Eminem and Kendrick Lamar are part of that same tree. This is the NFL/rap version of six degrees of separation.
Other SYFL alumni who currently play in the NFL include Jack Jones, Keisean Nixon, Juju Smith-Schuster, Romeo Dobbs and Deommodore Lenoir.
Stroud’s two seasons in Snoop’s league have given us one of the more interesting connections of football to the world of hip-hop we’ve seen. If Stroud ever leads the Texans to a Super Bowl title, he and Snoop may get a statue outside of NRG Stadium.
