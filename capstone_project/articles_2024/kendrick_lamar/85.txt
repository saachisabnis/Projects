More than a week after it was announced that Kendrick Lamar would be headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans, it’s a topic that continues to be discussed in the music industry. 
People continue to argue or defend why Lamar was the correct or incorrect choice over New Orleans native Lil Wayne...so much so that a 2022 article from the Charlotte Observer started making the rounds on social media, with people sitting a passage that read, “The selection process begins with a panel which includes officials such as the NFL’s director of entertainment, folks from the NFL’s production company, and the halftime show’s director and producer. After a long and detailed process, the shortlist is handed over to the Super Bowl’s hosting city for a final decision.”
For many on social media, that ended the argument altogether and led people to say that they should blame the City of New Orleans over Jay-Z and Roc Nation, who have helped produce the show since 2019.
But in a recent interview with Variety, Super Bowl halftime producer Jesse Collins contradicted the previous explanation: “It’s a decision that Jay makes. Since we’ve been onboard with that show, he’s made it every year, and it’s been amazing. He’s always picked right.”
So, now people who already believed Hov was responsible feel even more validated. Especially Nicki Minaj, who commented under a post about the Variety interview with a laughing emoji.
Even before this interview, Minaj and her fans were the loudest on social media when Lamar was announced as the halftime performer.
In one of her many posts, she wrote, “Go & enjoy your fkng money b4 it’s too late … One n—a took a knee The other n—a took the bag. “He gon get you ‘n—-s’ in line every fkng time.”
Hopefully, with this revelation, fans will stop arguing since there is nothing they can do to change the performer. Even if they decide not to watch, millions of others will be glued to the TV for Lamar’s much-anticipated performance.
