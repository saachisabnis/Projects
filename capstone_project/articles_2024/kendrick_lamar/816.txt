Following the release of Future and Metro Boomin’s collaborative LP, We Don’t Trust You, there’s been something of a war going on in the rap community – particularly between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
A day ago, Drake released a diss track aimed at Lamar entitled “Push Ups.” Before even giving him a chance to respond, Drake dropped another diss on Friday evening, “Taylor Made.”
While not yet on streaming services, Drake posted the song on Instagram, which opens with AI vocals from Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.
“Kendrick, we need ya, the West Coast savior / Engraving your name in some hip-hop history,” the AI Tupac says raps. “If you deal with this viciously / You seem a little nervous about all the publicity.”
The song’s title refers to Taylor Swift, who released her new album The Tortured Poets Department on Friday. On “Taylor Made,” Drake says that Lamar is likely waiting to drop his response diss track to avoid competing with Swift’s release.
