Terrance "Gangsta" Williams offered his thoughts on the unprecedented legal battle between Drake and UMG. The dispute arose after a rap battle where Kendrick Lamar emerged victorious, prompting Drake to reportedly pursue a lawsuit against him. Williams criticized Drake for "taking the fun" out of the traditional rap battle culture by involving legal measures, a move not seen before in the hip-hop industry.Williams expressed his detachment from taking sides, stating his intention to remain uninvolved with record label politics moving forward. He acknowledged the lyrical prowess of both artists, highlighting the disrespectful jabs exchanged as part of the metaphor-laden tracks. Williams particularly praised Kendrick for his contributions to rap, asserting that Kendrickâ€™s new album brought a resurgence of excitement reminiscent of the Death Row era in West Coast gangster rap. Ultimately, while acknowledging the competitiveness of the scene, Williams underscored the importance of maintaining the integrity and excitement of hip-hop battles without resorting to legal action.
