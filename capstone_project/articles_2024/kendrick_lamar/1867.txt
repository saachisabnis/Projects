Earlier this year, Kanye West accidentally sent a direct message to a Baby Keem fan account, mistakenly believing it was the official account of the Melodic Blue artist. In the DM, he shared the release date for his collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign, titled VULTURES 2. Unfortunately, the project didn’t live up to fans’ expectations when it was eventually released months later. Despite the letdown, the mix-up provided a humorous moment for fans, and it seems that Kanye has since straightened out his contact list.
Recently, a photo surfaced of Kanye and Baby Keem dining together with friends at a restaurant, although the timing of the image remains unclear. The two artists previously collaborated on “Praise God” from Kanye’s 2021 album, Donda, which raises the question of why Kanye didn’t reach out to Keem directly.

In addition to this curious interaction, Kanye has made headlines for other interesting connections in the rap scene. During a performance in China, he thanked Drake for writing the hook to his 2018 track “Yikes,” which surprised fans given their complicated history.
On the flip side, Baby Keem’s humor is notably less controversial than Kanye’s but still entertaining. Recently, he playfully trolled his cousin Kendrick Lamar by retweeting, “Kendrick the type of n***a to disappear after the bus passes.” This joke alludes to Kendrick’s past battles with Drake, sparking laughter among fans as they imagine the pgLang crew reacting to memes about the ongoing rivalry.
Both Kanye West and Baby Keem have upcoming albums, although details remain sparse. After Kanye’s DM mix-up, fans are left wondering if they will see new releases by the end of 2024 or if they’ll have to wait until 2025 for their next moves.
