Metro Boomin has gone viral for sniffing a woman’s fingers — and is not happy about it.
In a video of him preparing food at a cook out, a woman goes up to the producer and appears to ask him to sniff her middle and index fingers, which he does.

He then says in the clip: “I was trying to focus in on the smell in my mind but there weren’t no smell.”
The woman in the video then posted the clip on X along with the caption: “If Young Metro don’t trust you, it ain’t good coochie,” garnering over two million views.
Metro did not like the clip being posted online and replied to the post: “U so lame enjoy the clout.”
The woman in the video responded by saying: “N-gga you know it was just joke/skit that you agreed to do… [crying face emojis] this video went viral yrs ago ….. your ppl the one who sent it to me.”

While Metro may not be happy about the crude footage, he does still have reason to celebrate after his Heroes & Villains album surpassed 50 Cent’s seminal debut Get Rich or Die Tryin’ for streams on Spotify.
Metro’s album, which dropped in late 2022, has accrued 4,379,300,317 streams on the platform, while 50’s classic trails with 4,367,041,925.

The next Hip Hop album on the list above Metro’s is Dr. Dre’s classic 2001, with the super producer having already passed Kanye West’s iconic My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Drake’s third album Nothing Was the Same.
Drizzy still has three albums with more streams than Heroes & Villains with More Life, Views and Scorpion, while Kanye’s The Life of Pablo also has more listens than the Grammy-nominated project.

“Creepin'” received over 1.2 billion streams in 2023, making it the 12th most streamed song that year.
