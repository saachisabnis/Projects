Following the controversy around Kendrick Lamar‘s Super Bowl halftime gig, Lil Wayne reveals he’s spoken to K. Dot and wished him well on his performance.
He shared the news while discussing the GNX cut “wacced out murals,” on which Kendrick responds to Wayne’s disappointment over not being chosen to perform at the 2025 halftime show.
“I think he’s a fan, like I’m a fan of his music. … He saw with everybody else. He saw how much it meant to me, I think that’s all he means,” Wayne tells Skip Bayless of the song that heard Kendrick rap, “I used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud/ Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down.”
Wayne continued, “Obviously he can’t control that, you know? So he didn’t let me down. It ain’t like he can control it or nothing. And also I’ve spoken to him and I wished him all the best and told him he better kill it.”
Weezy also noted this moment is one that makes him want “to get to the point where I’m undeniable” and the NFL has no choice but to tap him as the halftime show headliner. 
The Bayless interview arrives after Wayne seemingly responded to the release of “wacced out murals” on X.
“Man wtf I do?! I just be chillin & dey still kome 4 my head. Let’s not take kindness for weakness. Let this giant sleep,” he wrote at the time. “I beg u all. No one really wants destruction, not even me but I shall destroy if disturbed. On me. Love.”
Super Bowl LIX will take place Feb. 9, 2025, in Wayne’s native New Orleans; he says he won’t be in the country at that time.
