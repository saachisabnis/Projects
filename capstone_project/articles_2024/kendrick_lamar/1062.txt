Mustard is looking forward to Kendrick Lamar taking the stage at the 2025 Super Bowl, and should he perform their “Not Like Us” collab, he’s ready to shed a tear.
In a conversation with Billboard published on Wednesday (October 9), the award-winning producer discussed the possibility of Kendrick performing the smash song during his halftime set at the big game, and said he’d love to see it even if he wasn’t asked to join him on stage.

“I definitely can’t wait to watch the Super Bowl, man. Can’t wait,” Mustard said. “This year’s going to be pretty special. I might shed a tear [if he performs ‘Not Like Us.’] I am grateful for him to perform it on stage. If he performs it on stage by himself and doesn’t call me, I wouldn’t give a shit. Just perform it.
“Don’t get me wrong – call me. If you want me, I’ll slide. But I’ll be there regardless going crazy, acting like I’m on stage. If I’m in a box, they might show me on TV from how crazy [I’ll be going]. I might stand on a chair. They might show me on the TV like, ‘He’s going berserk!’”
Mustard recently spoke about the success of “Not Like Us” in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. – and ruled out the possibility of collaborating with its subject ever again.
When asked if he’d ever reconnect with The 6 God, who he previously worked with on YG‘s 2014 hit “Who Do You Love?,” the West Coast native gave a blunt answer: “I don’t think I want to make a song with that dude. He’s a strange guy.”

Kendrick Lamar, on the other hand, is anything but, according to the producer.
“He’s just a genius. He does the unthinkable every time,” he said of his fellow Los Angeleno. “And on a human level, just as a normal person, I like his style.

“His whole mystique gives me the same vibes as Prince. Even now [after the success of ‘Not Like Us’], the guy has not posted anything. I told him, ‘I don’t know how you do that shit.’ Me, I’d be like, ‘Yeah, I’m no. 1!’”
