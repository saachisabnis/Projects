Taylor’s 2012 painting “Sweet,” as seen at Kendrick Lamar’s Lollapalooza performance last summer. Taylor’s tribute to Lamar in “B Side” looks over a floor-to-ceiling window, giving his “DNA” lyrics their own center stage.
This 2017 portrait of Jay-Z was originally done for the cover of T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Taylor painted the rapper from memory, and both its title and appearance reference the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Workers’ Strike.
The exhibit also features objects, like this suitcase Taylor painted in 2021 for Tyler, the Creator. “The idea that Tyler used that suitcase as an accessory — he has a real wit, I think,” Haskell says. 
In 2017, Taylor reimagined Gerhard Richter’s famous painting “Betty,” as a tribute to post-colonial painter Cassi Namoda. 
Painting in 2017 from a family photograph taken by his brother, Taylor depicted his cousins in a watchful stance in front of their home. ”The pose is a kind of wariness, he’s a little protective,” Haskell says. ”The whole canvas just kind of keeps you alert.”
This 2007 portrait re-creates the famous photograph of the Black Panther founder, combining it with clippings about the 2006 police shooting of Sean Bell. “It’s a perfect symbol of Black power,” Haskell says. “Looking back to African royalty, and then bringing it up to the present.”
In 2017, two years after painter Noah Davis died from a rare cancer at the age of 32, Taylor imbued his feelings of loss into a portrait of his departed friend as an even younger man. “They were very close,” says Haskell. “It’s about tenderness, but also this life cut short.”
