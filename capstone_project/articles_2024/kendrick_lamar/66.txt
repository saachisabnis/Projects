Drake's highly successful hip-hop tour, "It's All A Blur," faced challenges as JR Apparel, the company behind Members Only, filed a lawsuit against his Away From Home Touring company in New York. The lawsuit alleges that Drake's team unlawfully used the "Members Only" trademark from one of his tracks, causing possible confusion among consumers due to lack of proper licensing. JR Apparel's attorneys accused Drake of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trademark dilution for selling T-shirts featuring the Members Only mark on them during the tour, despite a previous attempt to resolve the matter amicably. The lawsuit also mentions concerns about counterfeit merchandise being sold on eBay. JR Apparel is seeking damages and requesting a court order to stop the sale of any more merchandise bearing the "Members Only" mark on behalf of Drake. This legal action coincides with fans creating their own merchandise related to Drake's disputes with other artists, such as Kendrick Lamar, hinting at a potential need for a new merchandising approach to avoid trademark issues.
