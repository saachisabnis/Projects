Latto celebrated a big milestone for her new album Sugar Honey Iced Tea by popping a bottle on camera.
The rapper took note of a post on X from Chart Data saying that her new project, released on Friday (August 9), hit number one on the U.S. Apple Music album chart — the first time in her career she’s hit that milestone.

Chart position isn’t the only notable thing about Sugar Honey Iced Tea. Fans have also noticed that some lyrics on the album add fuel to her long-rumbling feud with Ice Spice.
The project features a song called “S/O to Me,” on which the ClayCo (Clayton County, Georgia) representative seemingly takes a shot at her rival.

During the first verse, Latto raps: “Bye sis, funny thing about it, you can’t look me in my eye, sis,” which plays on Ice Spice’s first name, Isis.
The second verse hears her spit: “Shoutout to myself/ Who the hardest out? Bitch, it’s Latto by herself/ Ice is just water when it melts/ Wipe you down, I got plenty towels on the shelf.”

Listeners were quick to notice the slight. Akademiks took to Instagram and wrote: “Latto disses Ice Spice on new album. Y’all think ice spice should pick up a stick or y’all think them bars don’t need a response?”
Despite these fairly clear shots at Ice, Latto has been sending mixed messages regarding her intentions.

The Atlanta rapper touched on the beef during a conversation with Billboard last month, and said she has no plans to go bar for bar with the Bronx native in an actual feud.
When asked if she’d engage in a real beef with Ice a la Kendrick Lamar and Drake, Latto said: “I mean this in the most understanding [way]: I’m a fan of music. I’m not one of them ‘lyrical only, anything else is bullshit’ people. There’s so many sub-genres that I’m a fan of — like mosh pit-type music; when Drake is in his melodic bag, I like that type shit — and all of it is still Hip Hop.”

She continued: “If I was to do [a battle], it would have to be with somebody I feel like I’ma go tit for tat with. I really don’t mean it as shade. Would she even want to do that? I feel like she’s doing her in her lane. It’s two different types of vibes. I don’t even think she gives me like, ‘Oh, she wants to engage in an actual rap beef.’”
