WeTransfer and Water Street Projects present a retrospective exhibition by Bronx-born photographer Renell Medrano. Staged at WSA through November 2, 2024, the exhibition traces through Medrano’s past to make room for the new, marking her first hometown presentation in over five years. Inspired by her Dominican roots, the artist captures rebirth and return in equal measure, revealed through an intimate, lens-based language.
LAMBÓN surveys a wide range of editorial projects and collaborations mounted alongside intimate personal projects shot from trips to Egypt, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Her work brings a refreshing flair to entertainment and fashion, documenting the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Solange with tender authenticity and drama.
The show takes its title from a word in Dominican slang which translates to “moocher” or “leech.” Reflecting on work that is both pioneering and loyal to where it comes from, the WSA writes: “LAMBÓN speaks to a society that endlessly takes advantage of the creative liberation they’ve been afforded, Medrano draws a line in the sand and asks viewers: will you be a leader or a lambón?”
In the heat of a new era, the exhibition builds up to the launch of ICE, Medrano’s first magazine. Revisiting themes from her 2019 film “PELUCA,” the artist envisions this upcoming project as a space for women to see themselves in their truest form and explore the surrealist beauty of everyday life.
