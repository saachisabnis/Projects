In this clip, Terrance "Gangsta" Williams discusses the infamous Kendrick Lamar-Drake beef. According to Williams, Kendrick emerged victorious, especially after Drake released what Williams termed as a "soft" track, "The Heart Part 6." Williams expressed frustration with Drake's final song in the battle, describing it as lacking impact. While he remains a dedicated Drake fan, Williams acknowledged Kendrick's dominance, stating that Kendrickâ€™s music resonated more broadly, even being played in clubs and sports venues. Vlad echoed this sentiment, highlighting how Kendrick's track garnered four times the streams of Drake's.Moreover, the beef took a severe personal turn when Drake's bodyguard was shot near his home, causing Drake to pull back. Williams believes this incident sapped the fight out of Drake, who then removed all his Kendrick diss tracks from social media. Despite supporting Drake, Williams admitted Kendrick's strategic and lyrical prowess won the feud, leaving a lasting impact on both fans and numbers.
