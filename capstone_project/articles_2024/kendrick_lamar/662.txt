Fivio Foreign recently unveiled a new tattoo that pays homage to a New York icon—the Timberland boot. Earlier this week, the Brooklyn rapper visited Inkd London, a tattoo shop in the UK, and shared a video of his latest ink, featuring a boot print and the Timberland logo. He posted the artwork on his Instagram Story, prompting Timberland to repost it along with Fivio’s message: “@timberland hit me in [sic] tryna see somthin.” However, the tribute received mixed reactions from fans, with one commenter noting, “Not even the official boot print.” Yet, not everyone was critical; another fan described it as “the most New York shxt ever.”

In addition to his tattoo, Fivio has been making headlines for his bold predictions. He has shared a theory about Kendrick Lamar and Drake performing together at the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show.Despite their ongoing rivalry, the New York rapper claimed on his Instagram Story that he heard Kendrick would reunite with Drake on stage, stating, “So I heard that Kendrick is gon’ bring out Lil Wayne and then Lil Wayne is gon’ bring out Drake. And Kendrick is gon’ squash the beef on stage. That’s fire, right?”
When the clip was shared by Akademiks, many took to the comments to poke fun at Fivio’s prediction. “That boy talking crazy off the perkys, shit sound good tho,” one user commented, while another said, “N-gga just made all this up.” Additional remarks included, “Bro smoking Diddy baby oil” and “And then we all lived happily ever after…man if you don’t get this Disney channel fan fiction off my feed.”
Fivio has also shared opinions on other topics, such as why some women may dislike Ice Spice, attributing it to the attention she receives from men: “Bitches hate Spice cuz n-ggas love spice.” He later clarified, “I’m not n-ggas either… ijs,” before concluding with, “My bad lol.” This commentary follows his recent tattoo tribute to Timberland.
