Fresh off releasing Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé has dropped her new “Pony Up Remix” for the album’s first single, “Texas Hold ‘Em.”
The surprise version of the track begins largely the same as the Cowboy Carter song before the action moves from the Lone Star State to Louisiana on the second verse, with the remix featuring a new verse that gallops along to a New Orleans bounce breakdown. According to the remix’s credits, The-Dream was also involved in the Pony Up production:

Along with the remix, Beyoncé also launched a new website — BeenCountry.com — that ties in with Cowboy Carter, though its motive is currently unclear.
The Pony Up Remix follows a trend that Beyoncé started with her previous album, Renaissance, which saw plenty of surprise remixes — sometimes with major guests — emerging following that LP’s release.
Among those were an “America Has a Problem” remix that featured Kendrick Lamar and a “Vogue”-inspired “Queens Remix” of “Break My Soul” that enlisted Madonna herself. “Break My Soul” was also the recipient of a four-remix collection featuring Will.i.am, Honey Dijon, Terry Hunter, and Nita Aviance.
In February, Beyoncé became the first Black woman artist to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart in the modern history of country music, thanks to her single “Texas Hold ‘Em.” The track later topped the Hot 100 chart, marking the singer’s ninth time atop the chart as a solo artist. Last Friday, Spotify announced that Cowboy Carter currently holds the record for the most-streamed album in a single day in 2024.
