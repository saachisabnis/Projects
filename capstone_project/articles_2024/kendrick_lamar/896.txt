It seems the mission of pushing peace in vulnerable communities is still alive and well thanks to various community leaders and rappers like YG.
Over the weekend, the “Just Re’d Up 3" rapper hosted and organized a peace walk in Compton where he brought together rival gangs Treetop Pirus and Fruit Town Pirus, kids and family members for a stroll through the neighborhood. Starting at Gonzales Park, the walk also saw fellow rapper The Game partaking in it according to TMZ. Along the way, they stopped by local spot Tam’s Burger’s for food before continuing on. YG is also said to have helped facilitate more conversations between Treetop and Fruit Town in an effort to usher in more peace for their beloved city.
“Piru walk gotta ring [to it],” YG said in a video posted to his Instagram story on Sunday.
Whether it’s rappers like him, the late Nipsey Hussle, or even Kendrick Lamar who historically brought together a myriad of (alleged) gang members all on one stage months ago at his Pop Out concert on Juneteenth—making sure communities are at peace seems to be at the forefront of these rappers minds.
 As previously reported by The Root—who witnessed the historic aforementioned moment in-person—back in June, Lamar also asked a number (alleged) members of various gangs in L.A., namely the Bloods, Crips, and other sets, to join him in a sign of unity and oneness at the end of his concert. Though initially unorganized, the “Loyalty” rapper somehow wrangled together the whole group for a large group photo that will no doubt serve as epic album cover one day and a marker for peace for a variety of groups who many thought couldn’t ever be all under the same roof peacefully for years.
Is it a sign of bette days to come? One can only hope so.
