GloRilla brought the "Hot Girl Summer Tour" to the BET Awards. On Sunday night, June 30, the Memphis rapper hit the stage for the BET Awards 2024. She opened her set by parachuting down to the stage for her first banger "Yeah Glo!" Afterward, she moved on to her latest song "TGIF," which she dropped over a week ago. Glo's dancers helped her with a speedy outfit switch-up on stage before she got into her popular hit "Wanna Be." Of course, she couldn't perform the song without her "Hot Girl Summer Tour" mate Megan Thee Stallion. 
GloRilla gave the audience a glimpse at what fans got to experience during her joint tour with Megan Thee Stallion. CMG's hottest star ran through 21 cities around the U.S. She brought numerous songs from her recent mixtape Ehhthang Ehhthang to life like "Yeah Glo!" and "Bad Bih 4 Ya" along with her breakthrough hit "F.N.F." Meg and Glo would finish out the night by performing "Wanna Be" together. During their tour stop in New York City, Glo announced the "Wanna Be Remix" with Cardi B and released it a week later. Megan Thee Stallion also had a major performance during the awards show. Hot Girl Meg opened up the BET Awards with a medley of her new songs "Hiss," "BOA" and "Where Them Girls At." Taraji P. Henson made her grand entrance afterward with a parody of Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" followed by Victoria Mon√©t, who paid homage to the late Michael Jackson with her performance of "Alright."
