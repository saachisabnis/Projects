Kendrick Lamar extended his Pop Out stage to a wide variety of rappers -- and Kalan.FrFr says reaping the benefits was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!!!
Kalan.FrFr and G Perico perform “Right Wit It” at ‘The Pop Out: Ken & Friends’ https://t.co/JokqB2Aq92
The Roc Nation artist spoke with TMZ Hip Hop about his time onstage ... Kalan and G Perico performed their collab "Right Wit It" during DJ Hed's set and says Kendrick has been nothing but humble and genuine through all their encounters over the years.
Kalan tells us he wasn't exactly shocked at the K. Dot invite ... they're both from Compton and their degrees of separation are next to nothing.
Kendrick's Pop Out unity is totally the perfect synergy for Kalan's recent rollout ... his newest album is titled "Make The West Great Again" and its first single "Everybody" called for Crips and Bloods to stand together on even playing fields.
Maybe Kenny hops on the remix down the line??? We're sure that'd certainly be appreciated.
Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.
We also ask about the longevity of the gang truces Kendrick orchestrated ... Kalan says everyone put their differences aside for the cause, so it's #MWGA until further notice!!!
