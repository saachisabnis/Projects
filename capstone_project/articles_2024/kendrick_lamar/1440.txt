Jason Lee and DJ Vlad delved into the pervasive sexualization in female rap versus the more diverse representation in male rap. Discussing the industry's preference for female rappers who use sex appeal to sell, they contrasted this with male rappers like Drake and Kendrick Lamar, who do not rely on sexual imagery. They noted that every prominent female rapper, from Nicki Minaj to Cardi B, often appears scantily clad and has undergone plastic surgery enhancements.Lee mentioned that rap markets sex and aesthetic enhancements heavily, unlike female pop artists like Billie Eilish, who debuted with a more modest image. He argued that the industry constructs these images, influencing societal beauty standards and placing substantial pressure on female artists. In a nod to the drama involving Cardi B, while not explicitly naming Bia, the conversation highlights the complex interplay between public perception, industry expectations, and personal choices, underlining the pressures faced by female rappers in maintaining their public personas.
