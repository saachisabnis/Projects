Yung Joc opened up about past challenges, including significant losses in endorsement deals prompted by accusations from his baby mother. Yung Joc recounted an intense period where his ex claimed he was behind on child support, alleging a shortfall of tens of thousands of dollars. The reality, he noted, was a mere $500 discrepancy. Despite the minor amount, the allegations painted him as a deadbeat, leading to public backlash and financial repercussions. Comparatively, he sympathized with fellow artist Ne-Yo, discussing recent accusations against Ne-Yo by his baby mother. Thankfully, Yung Jocâ€™s situation was eventually resolved amicably, with his baby mother apologizing, sparing him from further damage.
