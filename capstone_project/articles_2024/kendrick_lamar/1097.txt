Quavo and Chris Brown are currently at the center of a feud that started earlier this month, and people think the latter pulled a pretty diabolical move to try to embarrass his rival after the Migos member was greeted by a suspiciously tiny crowd at a recent concert.
There’s been plenty of attention paid to the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar (which has led to some notable members of the hip-hop community joining the fray), but we’ve also been treated to an undercard courtesy of what’s transpired between Chris Brown and Quavo.
Brown got the ball rolling when “Freak” dropped midway through April, which featured a few lines where he explicitly dissed Migos while referencing Karrueche Tran, who supposedly dated Quavo after getting out of a relationship with the R&B singer she filed a restraining order against in 2017.
It only took Quavo a day to respond in kind with “Tender,” which referenced the restraining order. The rebuttal sparked a back-and-forth that subsequently spawned songs invoking the death of Takeoff, Brown’s well-documented abuse of Rihanna, and the elevator altercation between Quavo and Saweetie that unfolded in 2021.
Brown asserted he was moving on after claiming he was underwhelmed by the diss track Quavo dropped close to two weeks after they started trading jabs, but there are plenty of people who are convinced he had a hand in what transpired when his foe performed at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater in Bridgeport, Connecticut on Friday night.
That includes the attendee who claimed Brown was responsible for buying up tickets to ensure Quavo would be performing in a largely empty venue in a video capturing the underwhelming crowd that gathered in front of the stage during the concert.

If that tactic sounds familiar, it’s the same route 50 Cent opted to take when he bought 200 seats near the front of a Ja Rule show in 2018 to troll his longtime nemesis.
As of this writing, there’s no concrete evidence to suggest that was actually the case, but if Brown was in fact involved, it’s safe to assume he’ll come forward to take responsibility sooner rather than later.
