Future has earned his 11th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart as Mixtape Pluto debuts at the top of the Oct. 5 list. Released on Sept. 20, the long-awaited project amassed 129,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. during its first week, largely driven by streaming activity, according to Luminate.
Mixtape Pluto marks Future’s third No. 1 album of 2024, following his co-billed projects with Metro Boomin, We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, which topped the charts in April. This feat makes Future the fastest artist to achieve three No. 1 albums in a single year since the Glee cast’s three soundtracks in 2010. If we discount soundtracks, the last artist to notch three No. 1 albums as quickly as Future was The Beatles, who did so between 1965 and 1966.
With Mixtape Pluto, Future joins an elite group of artists with 11 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200. He now ties with Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand, and Ye (formerly Kanye West) for the fifth-most No. 1 albums on the chart. Ahead of them are The Beatles, holding the record with 19 No. 1s, Jay-Z and Taylor Swift with 14 each, and Drake with 13.

Diamond-certified, three-time GRAMMY® Award-winning hip-hop star Future continues his unstoppable streak with the release of MIXTAPE PLUTO on Sept. 20. The 17-track project, a nod to Future’s raw essence, also arrives alongside the official music video for “TOO FAST,” directed by Kid Art. Set against the backdrop of Harlem, NYC, the visual reflects the highs and lows of Future’s whirlwind lifestyle.
MIXTAPE PLUTO was executive produced by 808 Mafia’s Southside, with Wheezy serving as co-executive producer. Paying tribute to the legendary Dungeon Family and the late Rico Wade, the album cover showcases infrared purple lighting beaming from the Dungeon Family house in Atlanta, where Future’s musical journey began in Wade’s mother’s basement. The mixtape, notably without guest features, showcases Future’s unfiltered artistry and lyrical prowess.
In addition to the digital release, exclusive merchandise and physical versions of MIXTAPE PLUTO are available on freebandz.com. Fans can purchase limited-edition t-shirts, CDs, and two vinyl variants—black and green—featuring 11 key tracks from the album.
This project follows the massive success of Future’s earlier collaborations with Metro Boomin, WE DON’T TRUST YOU and WE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU, both of which topped the charts. These albums cemented Future’s dominance in 2024, with the single “Like That” featuring Kendrick Lamar spending three weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. 
MIXTAPE PLUTO represents Future’s return to his roots, offering fans a pure distillation of his sound and influence. Stripped down and unapologetically authentic, the mixtape is a powerful statement from one of hip-hop’s most inventive and influential figures, solidifying his legacy as he closes out an iconic year.
