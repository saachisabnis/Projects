Wack100 addressed why The Game didn't attend Kendrick Lamar's Pop Out show. According to Wack100, the decision was strategic and rooted in giving emerging artists a platform. He emphasized that Kendrick Lamar, much like Drake, is known for uplifting underground artists by dedicating stage time to them rather than established names. "If Kendrick or anybody from that camp needed Game, he would've been there," Wack100 stated, dismissing any notion of discord between the artists. The choice was about supporting new talent rather than overshadowing them, ensuring that emerging artists had their well-deserved moment in the spotlight.
