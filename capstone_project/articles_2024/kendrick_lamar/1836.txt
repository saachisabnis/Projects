Grammy-winning artist Bilal is set to release a new album, Live at Glasshaus, featuring Questlove, Common, Robert Glasper and Burniss Earl Travis II. The record due out during Black Music Month on June 14 via Glasshaus Presents is previewed by “Something To Hold.”
Bilal — who’s collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z, Beyonce, Erykah Badu and more — steps ito the spotlight on Live at Glasshaus alongside master players drummer Questlove, vocalist Common, pianist Robert Glasper and bassist Burniss Travis. The set captured on December 2, 2023 at Brooklyn’s Glasshaus is produced/directed by Jarrett Wetherell.
“I felt comfortable to create because I knew I had some of the best motherfuckers in the world playing,” Bilal said of the performance in front of 100 fans. “I like intimate vibes where everyone’s drawing off the energy in the room. When you’re up there making something and giving, with the people up there listening and receiving, it creates this circular motion of energy, it’s a timeless moment.”
A press release further detailed Live at Glasshaus.
