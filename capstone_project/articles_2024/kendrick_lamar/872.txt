Big Sean appears to have responded to claims that he bit Baby Keem‘s style on his recent single “Yes.”
The Detroit native dropped the song last month, but it was after the accompanying music video was released earlier this week that he was accused of copying Keem’s flow and cadence on the track.

Both rappers became trending topics on X (formerly Twitter) as listeners fueled the narrative with posts like: “We really live in a world where baby keem has 40 year old sons” and “Kendrick and Baby Keem bout to send Big Sean a cease and desist.”
However, there were plenty of fans who were quick to defend Sean Don by pointing out that he has used the flow he adopts on “Yes” long before Baby Keem broke through.

“N-ggas saying Baby Keem when Big Sean dropped Paradise years before Keem touched the scene,” one person wrote.
On Wednesday (August 21), Sean himself seemingly chimed in on the chatter and echoed the above sentiment.
“Must not be familiar wit my game,” he wrote.

Perhaps the reason Big Sean is sensitive over this claim is because of his history with Keem’s cousin Kendrick Lamar.
Following Kendrick’s blistering verse on their 2013 collaboration “Control,” on which he called out Sean by name along with several other rappers, the pair seemingly traded subliminal jabs on songs like “No More Interviews” and “The Heart Part 4.”

Last year, an early version of K. Dot’s 2018 track “Pandemic” leaked online and contained direct disses aimed at Sean, as well as Jay Electronica and French Montana.
The former G.O.O.D. Music MC opened up about his past rivalry with Kendrick in a recent interview with Charlamagne Tha God, revealing the Compton native apologized to him over text for the leaked diss song.

“I’m not a clout chasing-ass n-gga, bro. I’m solid. I stand on mine and I’m not about to do something because everyone thinks a certain thing,” he said, shuttinf down the notion that he backed down in the beef.
“We already talked about it. I already got an apology for it. I ain’t really had too much communication with him since then and you know, I represent a lot of people from my city from where I come from, fans of mine who think I didn’t stand on my shit and that’s not the case.”

He added: “That’s why I wanna clarify I wasn’t being a bitch or tucking my tail or nothing like that. If it was real smoke, if it was really something, I would be there front and center for it.”
Sean also revealed that he had a Kendrick Lamar diss song prepared before they buried the hatchet.
