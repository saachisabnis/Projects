The first thing that caught my attention Orlando singer Isaiah Falls was how infectious, yet simple his breakout track “Florida Baby” is. Bouncy production that initially begins as sweet and tender before the drums arrive serves as the backdrop to Falls’ message to his “Florida Baby” — an independent woman who takes care of herself and doesn’t need a man, but doesn’t mind one if they’re worthwhile. 
Falls’ vocals vary from song to song. The difference is sharp when you compare songs like “Florida Baby” and “Pain In My Voice.” On the former, Falls’ voice is pitched higher than other songs in his discography, and on “Pain In My Voice,” Falls’ vocals are brought down to earth to emphasize the emotions and pain he carries throughout the song. Then there’s “Sin On Purpose” which cements Falls’ voice as an instrument meant to be used in numerous ways, rather than just as is. The gritty “Flirty” and the soft and delicate “Tell The DJ” are additional examples of the wide field in which Falls employs his voice.
With a voice that plays all the roles he needs it to and songwriting that’s equally as good, Isaiah Falls has the ingredients to make a nice splash in 2024. A snippet he posted on TikTok is sure to make its rounds amongst ’90s R&B lovers this summer. Things are looking good for Isaiah Falls, so we caught up with the Florida native to learn about his inspirations, interests in and outside of music, and how he hopes to be remembered.
