	Florida rapper and viral sensation BossMan Dlow responded to a fan’s comments on Instagram Stories that his music “sounds the same.”

	IG user @bigxbailaaaaa wrote on her Stories, “Aye my mans @bossman_dlow why all your music sound the same? Why you get on Glo track and it sound like you merge your damn song! Get it together please! Goddam! I love you, though, but switch it up please & thank you.” This seemed to trigger Bossman into responding with some words. “Yall tell me switch it up,” he starts off his response with a screenshot of the original comment. “I’m trynna figure out like I thought everybody had their own sound, what y’all want me to bust out and rap like Kendrick Lamar? Dumb A–.”

	He then followed that up with a video of himself sarcastically rapping like a “lyrical miracle” rapper and said, “Yeah, that’s how you want me to rap? You stupid muthaf—ka.”

	The fan was referring to BossMan’s recent feature “Step” from GloRilla’s debut album Glorious where he raps in what has become his signature style of dropping social media worthy punchlines and one-liners. While he released two mixtapes in 2023, it wasn’t until he dropped Mr. Beat the Road earlier this year that he really started to gain traction. Songs like “Get in with Me” and “Mr. Pot Scraper” went viral on social media apps TikTok and Instagram, making him somewhat of a household name overnight within the rap community. Speaking of which, fans seem to be tapping into his older stuff as his song from 2023 “Shake Dat Ass (Twerk Song)” debuted at No. 9 on the TikTok Top 50 a couple months ago and it’s still on the list 15 weeks later.
