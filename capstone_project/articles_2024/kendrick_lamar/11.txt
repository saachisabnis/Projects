For those who love the experience of hearing new music from major artists, 2024 has been the gift that keeps on giving. Through the first six months of the year, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Megan Thee Stallion, Billie Eilish, Future, Metro Boomin’ and others have all delivered new, full-length projects. Not to mention, Kendrick Lamar and Drake delivered an album’s worth of diss tracks, producing one of the most significant beefs in Hip-Hop history
If the first six months were any indication of what’s to come, the year will go out with a bang. Eminem, Post Malone, Nas, Snoop Dogg and several others will put out new projects as rumors of new music from Rihanna, Drake and Kendrick Lamar swirling. Adding her name into the mix, Chlöe Bailey is prepared to put out her sophomore solo album, Trouble in Paradise.
“It’s still summer,” she said when asked about a release date.
“That’s all I can say.” 
As for the contents of the project, Chlöe Bailey did mention that her sister, Halle, will be featured on Trouble In Paradise.
“We both have our own lives,” she said last month.
“She’s a mom now, we’re both traveling, we’re constantly passing each other in the sky. And I was like, ‘Sis, we’re going to be in New York at the same time, I would love for you to be on the record.'”
