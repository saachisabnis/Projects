	Unlike Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s staggered beef, Chris Brown and Quavo‘s current back-and-forth is all systems go, as Quavo has shot back at Breezy following his venomous “Weakest Link” record. 

	Quavo’s response, “Over H*es & Bi**hes,” was shared on the artist’s YouTube Monday (April 27) afternoon, and features cover art photoshopped to depict Quavo choking Brown. The original snap was of Brown putting his hands around a woman’s neck, though he and the woman told TMZ at the time that they were just playing around. Within the song, Quavo shares his disbelief that Brown could still be upset about his brief fling with the “With You” singer’s ex, Karrueche Tran. 

	










	The Migos member starts off the track addressing Brown’s claims that he wouldn’t compromise “a bag”  by acting out of turn during Fashion Week, even if he truly wanted to square up when they were assigned to sit by one another.

	“You been f**ked your bag up when you punched Rih in the face,” Quavo rapped in reference to Brown’s 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend. “Talking about Fashion Week, you sparing who? Come punch me in my face (pu**y).”

	Quavo went on to mention that Brown’s aunt was held at gunpoint during a home invasion and that he lost his 2013 fight with Frank Ocean before cautioning, “This bullet got your name, don’t ever bring up Take.” In “Weakest Link,” Brown suggested the public would’ve rather Quavo died than the late Takeoff, who is featured on the “Over H*es & Bi**hes” hook.

	The Atlanta rapper goes on to call Brown a “pu**y” numerous times before alleging he tried to “beat up Teyana” Taylor during Lovers and Friends 2023, but that Usher stopped him from doing so. He also accuses Brown of using cocaine and of turning “into a junkie” and the “crackhead Michael Jackson, you better beat it, ni**a.” 

	Listen to “Over H*es & Bi**hes” below. 

	Brown reawakened the feud on wax with his 11:11 (Deluxe) track “Freak,” where he rhymed, “F**king my old bi**es ain’t gone make us equal/ Sipping that 1942 cause I don’t do no Cuevo [Quavo]/ Freak bi**h she like Casamigos, not the Migos.”

	Days later, Quavo responded with “Tender,” calling out the singer for being sensitive over his ex. 

	










	 “You did the bi**h wrong and now the bi**h gone, she posted with a thug/ Call the bi**h phone, she won’t come home, don’t beat her up/ It must be the drugs, need to cross out your plug,” Qua rapped on the diss record. 

	To this, Brown clapped back with “Weakest Link,” where he claimed to have slept with Quavo’s ex, Saweetie, while they were still together. Check it out below.

	Your move, Chris.
