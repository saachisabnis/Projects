Dee-1 calls out Joe Budden and others in his response to Kendrick Lamar's recent song. Earlier this week, the New Orleans native shared his song "Call It Like It Is" to his Instagram timeline. He included a photo of a pair of high-top Reebok Classics as the cover art for his track, which follows K.Dot and Lecrae's creative direction for their respective songs. On "Call It Like It Is," Dee-1 begins with Lamar's shout-out from "The Day The Party Died" before he unloads on the "so-called legends" who "turned this culture trash." Although he praises Lamar and Louisiana's own Lil Wayne in his first verse, Dee also takes aim at Budden. 
“Most of the media people lame, y’all wasn’t never really, really cool before you got inside of this here game," Dee raps. "Instigating, y’all being messy/You ain’t helping nobody grow/Tell Joe Budden I’m on a mission so don’t butt in, Joe.”Dee-1 is one of several artists who've shared their thoughts on wax following the impact of Kendrick Lamar's latest song. Right before Dee dropped, Lecrae also released his remix of Lamar's song called "Die For The Party," in which he answers the Compton rapper's question "I wonder what Lecrae would do." In addition, Ray Vaughn recently hit the recording booth to express his thoughts in a freestyle over the familiar instrumental. Rapper Ransom also blessed fans with his own version of Kendrick's track. Listen to Dee-1's new song "Call It Like It Is" below. You can also hear Ray Vaughn and Ransom's freestyles below as well.
