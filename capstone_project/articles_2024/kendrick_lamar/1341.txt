Though the seemingly never-ending beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake has been lighting a fire under hip-hop fans and others in and outside the industry—new info may suggest this whole situation could’ve been avoided entirely.
On the latest episode of “The Joe Budden Podcast,” the eponymous host suggested the aforementioned notion and cited insider information about an alleged conversation between Kendrick and Drake that happened before the first disses were exchanged.
“I heard that Drake and Kendrick had a talk before any diss record was released. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I heard they spoke!” Budden said.
He then went on to describe how the conversation allegedly went with Kendrick trying to get clear on the parameters of the beef and trying to warn Drake to essentially keep it strictly about rap. Kendrick also allegedly questioned the Toronto rapper on whether or not this was a path he really wanted to go down.
“It’s not even, like, real tea. It’s only tea ‘cause to say it to him on the phone—I know what that’s like when you about to fucking tear a nigga. ‘Let me call him and make sure first. Hey man, we doing this for real? You deadass?’” Budden added. “This has been the brightest spot of the year for me. All this kerfuffle-ing.”
Whether or not this convo actually went down aside, what we do know is that Kendrick did issue Drake a warning in his six-minute-long diss “euphoria” where he said: “if you take it there, I’m taking it further. That’s something you don’t want to do.”
Safe to say, “BBL Drizzy” didn’t take heed as evidenced by the slew of shots thrown back and forth this summer. And judging by Kendrick’s latest shot, it doesn’t seem like things are going to be dying down any time soon.
