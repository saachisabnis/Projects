Her expected appearance on the campaign trail comes after Harris welcomed other major musicians such as Bruce Springsteen and Eminem at various events across the country.
Historically, Beyonce hasn't involved herself directly in politics. However, she did sing the national anthem for former president Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2008.
She also performed at a rally in Ohio in the final days of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.
Meanwhile, Harris has used Beyonce's song "Freedom" as part of her campaign at several rallies and events.
"Freedom" appears on Beyonce's 2016 album Lemonade and features Kendrick Lamar.
Kamala Harris' past rallies have been livestreamed on TikTok and YouTube via news outlets such as PBS and ABC.
PBS will livestream the rally on Friday, which you can watch below via their YouTube channel.
Singer Willie Nelson and Beyonce's mom Tina Knowles are also expected to appear at the Oct. 25 rally.
NBC reports Harris' Texas appearance likely won't sway the state, which will likely go to ex-president Donald Trump, even though Texas has been leaning closer to turning blue.
