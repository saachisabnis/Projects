While former President Donald Trump continues to play The Village People’s 1978 disco hit “YMCA” on constant loop at his appearances, Vice President Kamala Harris’ saw his campaign theme music and raised him a viral hit from one of the most popular artist in the world.
The Vice President, who has already seen an overwhelming amount of support for her campaign from Hollywood celebrities, Black women and young voters, since announcing her intention to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination, just got a major burst of energy from an inspiring song.
During a July 22 appearance at her new presidential campaign headquarters in Delaware, Harris made her entrance to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” a GRAMMY-nominated collab with rapper Kendrick Lamar from her groundbreaking 2016 album “Lemonade.”
One thing about Beyoncé, she’s not giving just anyone permission to use her music. The “Texas Hold ‘Em”  artist keeps her hits under lock and key. But according to CNN, Harris got approval from Queen Bey’s team to use the song, which became a powerful protest anthem in the wake of George Floyd’s 2020 death at the hands of police, during her presidential campaign. 
Beyoncé supported the Biden-Harris campaign in 2020, posting an image of herself wearing a campaign face mask on Instagram on November 2 in a post she captioned, “Come thru, Texas! #VOTE 😘”
And while the “Break My Soul” singer has not yet made an official statement about Harris or the 2024 presidential campaign, her mother, Tina Knowles, threw her full support behind the Vice President in a July 22 Instagram post. 
“New, Youthful, Sharp , , energy !!!! You asked for it and our President Biden did what was best for the country ! Putting personal Ego , power and fame aside . That is the definition of a great leader, . Thank you, President Biden for your service and your leadership . Go Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Let’s Go ❤️❤️❤️❤️ #kamala2024,” she captioned a picture of herself standing with Harris.
