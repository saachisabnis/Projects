Kendrick Lamar‘s brand-new diss to Drake got a near-immediate answer…kind of.
On Tuesday (April 30), just a little over a month after Metro, Future and K.Dot’s “Like That” set in motion one of the most high-profile feuds in recent years, the Compton native released “euphoria” in response to Drizzy’s “Push Ups” and “Taylor Made Freestyle” rebuttals.

Soon after the scathing cut went live, an Instagram page called haus.of.drake shared a photograph of the Canadian superstar looking unimpressed and indifferent with the caption: “That’s it??”
Though the 6 God has yet to directly address the most recent series of shots fired his way, he did like the post from his official IG profile — check it out below:
In roughly six-and-a-half minutes, Kendrick Lamar’s latest release covers a number of issues pertaining to his adversary’s public persona, from ghostwriting and cosmetic surgery to race and tough-guy gimmicks.
Following a mellow, dreamy intro in which he refers to a “pathetic master manipulator” who is “paranoid,” “spiraling” and “fabricating stories on the family front,” the song kicks into life with a sudden beat switch.

From there, the Pulitzer Prize winner throws jab after jab at the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker, and even accuses him of sending a cease and desist letter in an attempt to have “Like That” taken down.
Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar dropped “Like That” in late March, which features the Los Angeles MC devoting his entire guest verse to taking shots at Drizzy and J. Cole.

A few weeks later, Drake released “Push Ups” to amp up the feud and followed it up with another joint called “Taylor Made Freestyle” just days after.
Whereas the authenticity of his first counterattack was under speculation for a while, the latter openly embraces artificial intelligence with features from the computer-generated voices of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg to convey alternate perspectives using lyrics that Drake wrote.

The beef has since escalated a great deal, with Rick Ross, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky joining Kendrick’s side and Cole withdrawing from the beef altogether after releasing a diss track of his own.
