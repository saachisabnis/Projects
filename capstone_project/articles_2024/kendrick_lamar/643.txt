Kanye West has responded to Sheck Wes‘ claims that he stole his style — but not in the way many would have expected.
Sheck, who signed to Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label in 2018, made his feelings known about his label boss in an explosive Instagram comment on Thursday (March 28).

Responding to Ye’s outspoken post about “washing” Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the Mudboy rapper wrote: “You stole my whole cadence, flow, beat, tempo to get #1 u delusional and u ain’t check in w the buzzins!! U n-ggas really bugged out!”
Wes later appeared to delete the comment, but not before Kanye posted it on his Instagram Stories as well as the rapper’s breakout hit “Mo Bamba.”
Sheck Wes is jointly signed to both G.O.O.D. Music and Travis Scott‘s Cactus Jack label but has struggled to match the success of “Mo Bamba” in the seven years since its release.
His last solo material came in 2022, although he recently made guest appearances on Travis’ UTOPIA (“FE!N”) and the Lyrical Lemonade compilation All Is Yellow (“Fly Away” alongside JID and Ski Mask the SLump God).

Kanye, meanwhile, recently claimed he was the greatest of all time and listed some of his achievements in an chest-thumping Instagram post.
“EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA,” he wrote. “EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT/ EVERYONE KNOWS I BROUGHT ADIDAS INTO THIS CULTURE AND, I TOOK THEM OUT/ EVERYONE KNOWS LOTTA DEMNA VIRGIL JERRY KIM ALL WORKED FOR ME.”

He continued: “I MADE YEEZUS DARK FANTASY PABLO/ GRADUATION THRONE 808S/ I MADE RUNAWAY DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS FATHER STRETCH/ I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO COME BACK TO NUMBER ONE AFTER CANCELLATION. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOAT/ I STAND BY ME/ MY FRIENDS CALL ME YE :).”
Kanye had earlier posted his collaboration with Kendrick, “No More Parties in LA,” on his Instagram Stories, leading many to believe he was siding with the Compton rapper in his rivalry with Drake and J. Cole. But it seems the purpose of the post was to champion his own verse, which is considered on of his best.

The battle between the “big three” ignited earlier this month when Kendrick took aim at Drizzy and Cole in a scathing guest verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.”
“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum, what? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack’,” he rapped in part.
