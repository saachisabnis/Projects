Kendrick Lamar dropped off the “squabble up” video on Monday, which featured a nod to Ice-T’s second album, Power. In case you need a Hip-Hop history lesson, the cover had a woman in a while thoung swimsuit and red heels holding a shotgun, which was also recreated in the video.
Seeing the moment, Ice-T showed love, writing “Respect!” on X. You can see the connection and the video below.
Respect! @kendricklamar 👑 https://t.co/jj5juB3ysm
