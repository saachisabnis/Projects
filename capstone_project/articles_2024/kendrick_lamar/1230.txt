The moment we’ve all been waiting for since the release of SZA‘s SOS album – a.k.a more of SOS – is here at last … A little over two years after the acclaimed album’s release, SZA has expanded the ethereal universe introduced on the album on her deluxe envisioning of the project entitled SOS Deluxe: LANA.
An ode to her birth name Solana, the deluxe reissue of the December 2022 album arrives after a slight delay. Initially slated to release on Friday, December 20 at midnight EST, the songstress gave it a slight push to an unconfirmed time later this morning – which eventually materialized in the form of a roughly 3 p.m. EST release.
“Just needed a few more hours for new mixes to ingest evenly across all platforms .. mixes are important,” she wrote in an Instagram story a few hours back.
However, even at just first glance, the project proves to be worth the wait, tacking on an additional 15 (!!) songs on top of the OG SOS tracklist. “Drive” – the one offering SZA dropped (solely on YouTube) at midnight – arrives as track 13 while this year’s single “Saturn” lands at number 15. Other new titles include “What Do I Do,” “30 For 30” – featuring none other than Kendrick Lamar – “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” “Love Me 4 Me” and “Crybaby.” Find the full list of new tracks below.
