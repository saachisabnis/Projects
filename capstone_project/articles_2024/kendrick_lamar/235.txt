Kendrick Lamar has finally returned fire with his new diss track "Euphoria." The song appeared on K-Dot's YouTube page on Tuesday (April 30), and serves as an official response to Drake's two diss tracks, "Push Ups" and "Taylor Made Freestyle," which the 6 God dropped in April. Kendrick's lengthy, three-part track was produced by Cardo, and also serves as the first solo song he's dropped since 2022's Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers album.
On the song, Kendrick again takes numerous jabs at Drake, who he mentions by name, while also throwing shots at Lil Yachty and mentioning J. Cole, Sexyy Red and YNW Melly.
Read through all the lyrics of Kendrick's "Euphoria" diss track.
Verse 1
EuphoriaThem super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silenceThe famous actor we once knew is looking paranoid and now spiralingYou're moving just like a degenerate, every antic is feeling distastefulWhy calculate, you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angleFabricating stories on the family front ’cause you hurt Mr. MoraleA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you nowYou're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being acceptedTommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been in your collectionI make music that electrify ’emYou make music that pacify ’emI can double down on that line, but spray you this time, that's random acts of kindnessKnow you a master manipulator, and a b***h, you a liar, tooBut don't tell no lie ’bout me, and I won't tell truths ’bout you
