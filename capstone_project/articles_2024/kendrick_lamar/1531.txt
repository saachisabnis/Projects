Fans appear to be speculating once again about who Drake may have conflicts with next. Recently, some attentive fans noticed that Lil Yachty unfollowed Drake on Instagram, which surprised many due to their previously strong friendship and collaboration. They often interacted online and in person, making this change notable. Supporters from OVO and Concrete quickly began to speculate that the upcoming release of Drake's song "Supersoak" could be related to this situation. DJ Akademiks has shared a clip of the music video for this track, which originally included Lil Yachty. Yachty had previously leaked the original version to Kai Cenat to play during his livestream because they couldn't clear a sample. The sampled artist, Mr. Hotspot, requested a clean version due to his religious views, leading to complications. 
Many are now suggesting that Mr. Hotspot might be upset with Yachty for discussing this on a podcast, implying that he told Drake to proceed with the release if Yachty was removed. However, this speculation lacks solid evidence, and it remains uncertain whether any issues truly exist between them, as it could simply be a marketing strategy. Their relationship hasn’t always been smooth; for instance, Yachty’s comments on Drake's feud with Kendrick Lamar sparked backlash from Drake's fans.
Whether Drake and Lil Yachty will address this situation remains to be seen. While not every fan is enamored with their collaboration, there is concern about the potential decline of their partnership. The timing of these events raises questions about whether it’s just a playful distraction or if there’s something more significant happening behind the scenes.
