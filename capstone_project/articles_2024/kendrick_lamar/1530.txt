BossMan Dlow has channeled his inner Kendrick Lamar after a fan claimed that all of his music “sounds the same.”
The Florida trapper’s burgeoning career came in for harsh criticism on Monday (October 14) when a fan wrote online: “Aye my mans @bossman_dlow why all your music sound the same? Why you get on Glo[Rilla] track and it sound like you merge your damn song!

“GET IT TOGETHER PLEASE ! [three crying laughing emojis] GODDAM! I love you, though, But switch it up PLEASE & THANK YOU [heart with diamond emoji].”
The “Get In With Me” hitmaker did not take kindly to the request and clapped back on his Instagram Stories: “Yall tell me switch it up, im trynna figure out like I thought everybody had their own sound, wat yall want me to bust out and rap like Kendrick Lamar? Dumb Ass.”

He then posted a video of himself sarcastically spitting some complex bars to appease the disgruntled listener, rhyming words like “lyrical” with “spherical.”
At the end of the clip, he says: “Yeah, that’s how you want me to rap? You stupid muthafucka.”
If music doesn’t work out for Dlow, he has expressed interest in a second career as a SportsCenter anchor.
In August, the XXL Freshman asked to be invited on to the show after ESPN showed him love by quoting his music on a broadcast.
