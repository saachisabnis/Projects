Update (June 4):
Ye's legal representation sent along the following statement to XXL in response to Ye's ex-assistant Lauren Pisciotta filing suit against him for sexual harassment.
"In response to these baseless allegations, Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta, who actively pursued him sexually to coerce employment and other material benefits, then engaged in blackmail and extortion when her advances were rejected," the statement read. "Prior to her termination as an assistant, Ms. Pisciotta stole his cell phone in an attempt to destroy phone records that would contradict her claims, all of which have been preserved. She was terminated for being unqualified, demanding unreasonable sums of money (including a $4 million annual salary) and numerous documented incidents of her lascivious, unhinged conduct."
The statement continued, "During her employment, Ms. Pisciotta offered Ye sex on his birthday to which he declined, sent Ye unsolicited nude images, sexual narratives and was seen twerking in the office during business hours. On one occasion, Pisciotta boasted how the best moment of her life was when she was being ejaculated on by a soccer player while simultaneously texting her boss. It is well documented how Ms. Pisciotta consistently used sexual coercion in an attempt to demand not only money but material items, namely Hermes Birkin bags, a Lamborghini and an endless quest for plastic surgery.  Upon having her advances rebuked, Pisciotta's blackmail demands have gone from $60M last year to $50M in last week's frivolous filing."
It concluded, "Such behavior is entirely inconsistent with someone who claims to have been sexually harassed or experienced a hostile work environment. It is evident that Ms. Pisciotta leveraged her association with Ye and his company, and her proximity to him, to seek material gains, clout, and employment through inappropriate means. Her initial attempt at a lawsuit for unlawful termination gained no media traction, leading her to fabricate headlines following threats of blackmail and extortion. Ye isn’t the only celebrity targeted by Pisciotta. Jay Leno is suing her for stealing his chin."
Ye himself has not yet responded to the lawsuit.
Original Story (June 3):
Ye's former assistant is reportedly suing him for sexual harassment, claiming he sent her inappropriate texts and videos.
On Monday (July 3), TMZ reported that Ye was being sued for sexual harassment by his ex-assistant Lauren Pisciotta, who is also a former OnlyFans model. Ye hired Pisciotta in July of 2021 after meeting her while developing his fashion line. She claims in the docs that she even contributed to three songs on Ye's 2021 album Donda.
Pisciotta claims Ye promised to pay her $1 million a year if she deleted her OnlyFans and came to work for him, saying he could make her "God Like" if she agreed. Shortly after she began to work for Ye, he allegedly began sending her explicit text messages that made her uncomfortable.
"See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I'm f**king them," one of the texts allegedly read. "Then I want her to cheat on me."
TMZ claims the texts continue to get more and more vulgar, with Ye going into visceral detail about his sexual fantasies.
"Is my d**k racist? It is. This f**king racist d**k of mine," Ye allegedly wrote in another text. "I going to beat this f**king racist d**k for being f**king racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of White women with Black a*ses and beat the s**t out of my racist d**k...Beating the s**t out of this big Black c**k."
Pisciotta said the harassment continued to escalate, and claimed Ye would openly pleasure himself during their phone conversations. He would also ask if she knew what he was doing. He also allegedly sent her two videos of him having sex with models.
Pisciotta claims she was fired in October of 2022, and that Ye said he'd pay her a $3 million severance. She says she accepted but never received it. Pisciotta is suing Ye for breach of contract, sexual harassment, wrongful termination and a hostile work environment.
XXL has reached out to Ye's team for further comment.
This isn't the first former employee of Ye to file suit against the mogul this year. According to documents obtained by XXL back in April, Ye is also facing a lawsuit from a former employee of both the Yeezy brand and Donda Academy, Ye's failed school in California. The 31-page suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Benjamin Deshon Provo, who is Black, and who claims Ye engaged in unfair labor practices and racial discrimination.
"Specifically, [Ye] frequently screamed at and berated Black employees, while in contrast, he never so much as raised his tone of voice toward White staff," the lawsuit states.
Provo also claims he was unfairly targeted because of his Muslim faith, and that he refused to convert to Christianity despite Ye telling him to.
