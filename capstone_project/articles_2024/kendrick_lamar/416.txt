Coi Leray is embracing a “grown and sexy” transformation in the new year, and she’s giving fans a first glimpse with her new single.
On Thursday (January 25), the “Players” rapper released her first single with her new label, Island Records: a Mike Will Made-It production titled “Wanna Come Thru.”

“This song is about me on my grown and sexy,” Coi said in a statement. “Grown and sexy means being so in love with yourself — that it is one of the most sexiest, maturest, grownest things that a woman can [be]. As you get older and you tap into your womanhood and your femininity and I feel like you should embrace that.
“It’s feeling good for yourself; looking in the mirror and just loving yourself. 2024 is going to be my grown and sexy era. I’m taking over this year. I’ve got so much new music and a whole new side of me to get to know.”

Mike Will Made-It also applauded Coi’s latest release, dubbing it a “culture-shifting record.”
“The song is just fresh and forward-pushing,” the Atlanta-bred producer said. “What I love about it is it sounds simple and easy to digest and instantly puts you in a mood. It’s the best feeling ever to be able to create a song that makes the listener feel good.”

He added: “This is hit No. 1 fasho, we have plenty more on the way.”
Over sensual yet pounding production, Coi Leray details her romantic exploits, singing: “Give me head like I did/ Keep going, don’t you stop/ Come sweep me off my feet/ I wanna feel it inside/ With me, you can’t go wrong.

“Then fuck me ’til the sun/ Pull my panties to the side/ ‘Til I can’t feel it no more/ Oh, wanna touch right there, want you to make me say ‘uh!’/ Slow down, go fast, and don’t stop ’til you cum.”
Listen to the “Wanna Come Thru” below.
Coi Leray’s new deal with Island Records marks her second label home following Republic Records, who she joined in 2019 following the success of buzzing hits like “By Myself” and “Huddy.”
She released two albums on Republic — 2022’s Trendsetter and last year’s Coi — while scoring a string of Hot 100 hits including “No More Parties” with Lil Durk, the Nicki Minaj-assisted “Blick Blick” and, of course, “Players.”

Next month, Coi will compete at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards where she has two nominations: Best Rap Performance for “Players” and Best Pop/Dance Recording for “Baby Don’t Hurt Me,” her collaboration with David Guetta and Anne-Marie.
Also in the running for Best Rap Rerformance are “The Hillbillies” by Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar, “Rich Flex” by Drake and 21 Savage, “Love Letter” by Black Thought, and Killer Mike‘s “Scientists & Engineers,” featuring Future, Andre 3000 and Eryn Allen Kane.

“One of the biggest things and accomplishments for me as an artist is for people to know me and admire my versatility. To be nominated for two of my voices — my melodic, my rap, my singing — again it’s a dream come true. I wouldn’t want it any other way, honestly,” Coi told the Recording Academy of becoming a first-time nominee.
Speaking on the success she found with “Players” in 2023, she added, “When I made ‘Players’ it definitely felt special. Put it like this: when I went in there and recorded it straight through, this reference, I’m like, ‘Yo! I’m just gonna rap.’ And I rapped the whole through and from there you can just hear it.”
