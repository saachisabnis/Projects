SZA plans to add more unheard songs to her latest album LANA in the New Year. Several days after the SOS Deluxe LP dropped earlier this month, the Grammy award-winning singer said she wanted to switch "some mixes out" and add new material after "listening w a clear mind." On Monday morning, December 30, SZA confirmed she's doing more than simply updating some mixes. She revealed new songs will also be added to the album in a post she uploaded to X. “Just got word all updated Mixes and new songs will be added Jan 6th when the label comes back from holiday,” she wrote. 
“Sorry they can’t do it any sooner," she added. "Just wanted to keep y’all in the loop. Thank y’all for your patience.”SZA teased the release of her SOS Deluxe: LANA album for well over a year before it finally arrived on December 20. Following a slight delay, fans finally got to hear her massive 32-track project. It contains 15 fresh songs like "Scorsese Baby Daddy," "Kitchen" and "30 For 30" featuring Kendrick Lamar. She also shared the music video for "Drive/Crybaby" starring Ben Stiller. After the album dropped, SZA said she got the green light from her now-former manager Terrence "Punch" Henderson to share more new music. She teased three additional tracks — “Take You Down,” “PSA,” and “Open Arms" — that didn't make the final cut in a screenshot of her recent text conversation with Punch a few days before they parted ways. The new version of LANA is expected to arrive on January 6. It'll come a few months before she hits the road with Kendrick Lamar for their "Grand National Tour." Their upcoming arena tour will invade 19 cities in the U.S. and Canada beginning in April. Tickets are on sale now.
