	It’s been almost 11 months since Lil Nas X boldly declared that “b—h I’m back like J Christ.” Now, the singer promises, he’s actually back for good. 

	In a video posted to his X account on Sunday night (Nov. 10), the rapper revealed that “phase 1” of his new era begins on Monday (Nov. 11). In the video, Lil Nas shows a clip of himself as the biblical figure Noah from his “J Christ” music video, while his house-infused dance track “Light Again” plays behind him. 

	“When the world needed him the most, he vanished,” the text throughout the clip reads. Then, the video cuts to a new figure wearing a white motorcycle helmet with cat ears sticking out of it. “But now, he’s back … and better,” the text reads, before showing a stylish new logo that reads “Dreamboy.”

	The new video comes after Lil Nas announced that his song “Light Again” would be officially debuting this week, after the rapper previously shared the track in clips on his social media and in full on his SoundCloud page. The singer has yet to unveil an official release date for the Take a Daytrip-produced song.

	Lil Nas has been quietly starting to post more on his X account, including back in October when he sent his congratulations to both Shaboozey and Kendrick Lamar, who broke two chart records previously held by “Old Town Road.” After “Not Like Us” dethroned “Road” as the longest running No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, and after “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” beat the song’s record atop the Canadian Hot 100, Lil Nas X shared nearly identical messages of congratulations to both artists. “It was a good run,” he wrote. “the horses are officially actually in the back now!”
