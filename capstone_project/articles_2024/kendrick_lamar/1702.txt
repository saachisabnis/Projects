Drake has seemingly hit back at Soulja Boy amid their growing tension. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, July 24, Kai Cenat debuted an unreleased song from Drizzy and Lil Yachty during his livestream. The song has both artists rapping over a sample of Mr. HotSpot’s viral hit “Goodness Gracious." In the chorus of the song, Drake refers to Soulja Boy's 2007 hit "Super Soak" and his record label Stack On Deck (SODMG). “I’m watching the moves, playin’ it close/SOD (stacks on deck), super soak, rainy days, his and hers matching coats," Drake raps. 
The warning shots on Drake and Lil Yachty's upcoming collaboration come a week after Soulja Boy mentioned the OVO Sound founder on his X timeline. During his rant, Soulja Boy expressed his disappointment in the 37-year-old artist after his beef with Kendrick Lamar ended. "Swag Season July 28 never let a n***a try me like I’m drake," SB wrote. "You disappointed me @Drake," he continued. "Doing all them weak ass songs with them n***az look where It got u none of them n***az you collab with or took on tour had yo back @Drake."
Soulja Boy and Drake's feud goes back to 2019 when the "Crank That" rapper scoffed at Aubrey's name during his interview with The Breakfast Club. After Charlamagne referred to Drake as the "biggest rapper in the world," Soula Boy's reaction instantly went viral. "Draaaaakkkeee?! That n***a who got bodied by Pusha T?" he shouted. "Drake?! Y’all n***as better stop playing with me in here. Y’all talking about the light-skinned n***a from [Degrassi]? Stop playing with me like I didn’t teach Drake everything he know.”It's not clear when Drake and Lil Boat will drop the song. As of this report, Soulja Boy has yet to respond.
