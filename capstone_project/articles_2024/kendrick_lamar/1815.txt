Mustard has unveiled both the cover art and the release date for his forthcoming album, Faith Of A Mustard Seed.
The award-winning producer previously announced the project would be arriving some time this summer while celebrating his birthday earlier this month. In an Instagram post on Monday (June 10), he added more details.

“FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED. 7.26.24 #FOAMS,” he wrote with the LP’s cover, which is a photo of him on the turntables as a child.
Check out the post below.
Faith Of A Mustard Seed follows 2019’s Perfect 10, which featured the hits “Pure Water” with Migos and “Ballin” with Roddy Ricch.
The new LP comes amid Mustard’s resurgence of sorts, as he achieved the first No. 1 song of his career with Kendrick Lamar’s recent Drake diss “Not Like Us.”

Taking to Instagram on Mother’s Day last month, Stroud shared the news and wrote: “Over the moon to be celebrating my first Mother’s Day. 2 months or less until I’m pushing and meet by sweet baby.”
She also uploaded photos of her pregnancy journey so far, along with a text message conversation with her partner from January, presumably soon after she learned about her pregnancy.

However,  while Mustard appears to be experiencing bliss in his current relationship, he has been involved in a nasty legal battle with his estranged wife, with whom he shares three children.
