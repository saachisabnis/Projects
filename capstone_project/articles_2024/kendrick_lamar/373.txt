Soulja Boy woke up with Drake‘s recent Kendrick Lamar battle on his mind, and proceeded to call out the OVO rapper for “disappointing” him.
In series of posts to X in the middle of the night on Tuesday (July 16), Soulja poked fun at the fact that none of Drake’s many collaborators came to his defense amid his feud – which many argue that he lost.

Soulja Boy had a memorable viral moment involving Drake in 2019 when “Draaaaaaaaaake?” became a meme during his visit to The Breakfast Club.
The dramatic response came after Breakfast Club co-host Charlamagne Tha God called Drake the “biggest rapper in the world.”

Shocked by this revelation, Soulja quickly replied, “Draaaaakkkkkkeeee?! That n-gga who got bodied by Pusha T? Drake?! Y’all n-ggas better stop playing with me in here. Y’all talking about the light-skinned n-gga from [Degrassi]? Stop playing with me like I didn’t teach Drake everything he know.”
Revisiting the moment in an interview with HipHopDX in 2022, Soulja said: “Man, I wasn’t expecting it at all. I just went up there, spoke, had a good time, talked to The Breakfast Club. I just spoke my mind, you know what I’m saying? And when I got home, when I got to the hotel, my phone was going crazy and the internet was going viral.

“I was like, ‘What happened? What did I say?’ And it was like, ‘You was like, Drake?’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah.’ Yeah. But nah, man, it was a good interview, man.”
The pair have seemingly been fine in the years since.
