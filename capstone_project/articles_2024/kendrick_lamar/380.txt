Kendrick Lamar's fans are buzzing about his next move after the Compton rapper appeared to release a previously unheard song from his vault without notice. A surprise song called "Money Without Me" appeared on K.Dot's YouTube channel on Tuesday night, December 17. The piano-laced record sounds like a track from his Section.80 era, however, the cover art shows Lamar seated in the black Buick GNX from his recent GNX album. The cover art has led fans to believe the surprise release is a sign that the long-rumored deluxe edition of Lamar's sixth studio album is arriving soon. 
Rumors surrounding Kendrick Lamar's GNX Deluxe have been swirling in the weeks since he released the album in November. Fans first realized another project may be in the works after Lamar alluded to the possibility in his "squabble up" music video. The video included references to double albums by the late Nate Dogg and Isaac Hayes. It also featured a tan Buick GNX in the background near the end of the video. Not long after the first album dropped, Left Gunplay, who appears on "tv off," also said Lamar has a deluxe version on the way. 
“I know he’s got a deluxe version coming out,” Lefty told Bootleg Kev. “So I don’t know what he’s got going on. He’s very [secretive], but when you kick it with him in person he’s cool man.”It's not clear how or why the song appeared on Kendrick Lamar's YouTube channel and no other streaming service. Kendrick has yet to post about it like he's done with his other music. We've reached out to his reps for comment. Listen to "Money Without Me" here.
