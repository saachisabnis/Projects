Lil Wayne just nabbed the second diamond plaque in his career, this time for his 2013 Drake and Future collab “Love Me.”
On Monday (September 30), the 11-year-old banger officially hit 10 million units, certifying its diamond status with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The diamond plaque arrives less than two years after Weezy was awarded his first: his 2008 hit “Lollipop” hit the milestone in December 2022.

Living on his 2013 album I Am Not A Human Being II, “Love Me” became Wayne’s 18th top ten hit, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became Future’s first top 10 hit and most successful single until five years later with his 2017 song, “Mask Off.”
The good news arrives amid a bit of a sour moment for Lil Wayne, who expressed his extreme disappointment when he wasn’t chosen as the halftime act for the 2025 Super Bowl in his hometown of New Orleans.

Following outrage from peers and fans alike over the NFL’s decision to book Kendrick Lamar instead of NOLA’s own Weezy to perform at Super Bowl LIX on February 9, the Young Money leader finally addressed the situation in a video posted on Instagram earlier this month.
A solemn-sounding Wayne began by thanking those who have spoken up in his defense, saying: “First of all, I want to say forgive me for the delay. I had to get strength enough to do this without breaking. I’ma say thank you to every voice, every opinion, all the care, love and support out there. Your words turned into arms and held me up when I tried to fall back.”

He then shared his heartbreak and disappointment at the snub and blamed himself for getting his hopes up over the gig, which he had openly coveted prior to last week’s announcement.
“That hurt. It hurt a lot. You know what I’m talking about. It hurt a whole lot,” he continued. “I blame myself for not being mentally prepared for a letdown, and for automatically mentally putting myself in that position like somebody told me that was my position. So I blame myself for that.

“But I thought that was nothing better than that spot and that stage and that platform in my city, so it hurt. It hurt a whole lot. But y’all are fucking amazing. It made me feel like shit not getting this opportunity and when I felt like shit, you guys reminded me that I ain’t shit without y’all… and that’s an amazing reality.”
Wayne concluded: “So, like I said, it broke me and I’m just trying to put me back together. But my God, have you all helped me. Thanks to all of my peers, my friends, my family, my homies on the sports television and everybody repping me. I really appreciate that, I really do.
