Drake is taking his beef with Kendrick Lamar to a whole new level by dragging West Coast legends into his second diss track. On Friday night, April 19, the Toronto native posted a new song called "Taylor Made Freestyle" directly to his Instagram timeline. The record begins with an AI-generated verse by the late Tupac Shakur, which was written by Drake himself. AI 'Pac tries to encourage Kdot to respond by giving him fuel to use like the allegations about Drake's friendship with actress Millie Bobbie Brown. Faux 'Pac also bullies Lamar about his height and clowns him for allegedly moving his response back due to Taylor Swift's new album. 
"Now you 'bout to give this shit another week/And fall back to home girl who runnin' numbers up? I woulda refused," AI 2Pac raps. "F**k these industry relationships, she not in your shoes/You supposed to be the boogeyman, go do what you do/Unless this is a moment that you tell us this not really you."The next AI-generated verse comes from Snoop Dogg, who also tries to get a response out of Kendrick. Fake Snoop reminds the Compton rapper that he passed the torch to him over a decade ago. He also pushes Lamar to make a power move and "show this f**king owl who's boss on the West." The real Snoop apparently heard the song and offered up his response on Instagram. 
Drake closes out the song by giving Lamar a deadline in his authentic verse. He claimed the "Like That" rapper is moving too slow and that the world will have to wait a week for his response. It's clear Drake isn't letting the beef die down anytime soon, and even teases another response coming soon. "Since 'Like That,' your tone changed a little, you not as enthused," Drake spits. "How are you not in the booth? It feel like you kinda removed/You tryna let this s**t die down, nah, nah, nah, Not this time, n***a, you followin' through/I guess you need another week to figure out how to improve/What the f**k is taking so long? We waitin' on you."
