According to Vibe, Jesse Collins, the Super Bowl Halftime Producer confirmed what everyone's been feuding about on social media over the week regarding who is ahead of picking the halftime performance.
Collins recently spoke with Variety about Kendrick Lamar being the pick to perform at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. He revealed that Jay-Z is solely responsible for picking the headliners for the halftime show. 
While highlighting the love of Wayne, Collins said, "We love Wayne... But I think we're going to do an amazing show with Kendrick, and I think everyone's going to love the halftime show."
"It's a decision that Jay makes... Since we've been on board with the show, he's made it every year, and it's been amazing. He's always picked right," Collins added.
This comes after news broke on Kendrick Lamar performing in New Orleans for the Super Bowl and some celebrities and fans were not in favor of it. Nicki Minaj and Birdman took to their socials speculating about the ill relationship between Wayne and Hov on why he wouldn't be performing in his hometown.
Wayne posted a video on Instagram about how he felt not being picked. See the post above.
