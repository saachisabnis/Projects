Kendrick Lamar‘s instantly classic Drake diss “Not Like Us” has inspired a tribute that went viral.

The success of “Not Like Us” has been a tremendous boon for the Compton rapper.
It was recently reported that Kendrick Lamar has closed in on Drake‘s streaming stats on Spotify thanks to their recent multi-song battle.

In metrics shared by HipHopNMore‘s Navjosh via Chartmetric on May 31, Drizzy had a strong lead out of the gate with the J. Cole-assisted “First Person Shooter” back in the fall, but K. Dot quickly caught up to the streaming numbers with his appearance on Metro Boomin and Future‘s “Like That” in March.
The songs were both sitting at over 300 million streams, with Drake having held a slight lead at around 319 million to Kendrick’s 309 million.

The next exchange was Drake’s “Push Ups,” followed by Kendrick’s “Euphoria.” Kendrick held the lead on that one with 135.3 million streams, compared to 93.7 million streams on “Push Ups.”
The next two, “Family Matters” and “Meet The Grahams,” were just about tied around the 50 million mark, but it’s the Mustard-produced “Not Like Us” that really had Kendrick Lamar in the lead.

With already over 217 million streams since its release less than a month ago, he outpaces Drake’s final release “The Heart Part 6” completely – as Drake didn’t put the song on streaming services.
Drake also released the Kendrick Lamar diss “Taylor Made Freestyle” amid the battle, but he soon had to remove it from all platforms – as 2Pac’s estate did not take kindly to the use of the late rapper’s likeness with AI.

The song, which featured AI vocals from both ‘Pac and Snoop Dogg, was officially been removed from Drake’s social media pages after the “Dear Mama” rapper’s estate gave Drizzy 24 hours to take down the controversial track.
Despite the recent monumental success, it seems as if King Kendrick is staying busy.
