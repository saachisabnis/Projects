Juice WRLD‘s first-week sales projections for The Party Never Ends – what stands to be the late rapper’s last posthumous album – are in.
According to a report from HDD on Thursday (December 5), the LP is headed for a strong No. 4 debut with 93,000 album equivalent units. Juice falls behind Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department at No. 1 (who returned to the top spot due to a Black Friday vinyl sale of the album), Kendrick Lamar’s GNX at No. 2 and the Wicked soundtrack at No. 3.
The Party Never Ends arrived on Black Friday (November 29) – just days before the fifth anniversary of Juice’s passing.
“Been 5 years kid, still missing you down here…” Juice’s label head Lil Bibby wrote while announcing the effort. “Feels like yesterday you were down here cracking ya corny jokes. Your fans still miss you, still getting on my nerves everyday. One of them just told me that I had a penthouse in hell waiting for me [laughing emoji].

“Other than that the album is amazing, and it’s crazy to see that these kids still want more from you after 1000 leaks and hours of footage. Thank you, and your crazy fans for everything, Hope yall enjoy this Last Album! 999 for Life!!!”
The trailer stars actor Eric Roberts as a grandfather putting his grandchildren on to Juice’s music. The cover art was also released, which is designed by famed artist Takashi Murakami.
Ahead of the album announcement, Juice WRLD’s team released the Nicki Minaj-assisted single, “All Girls Are the Same 2 (Insecure).”
In other news, Juice WRLD’s estate is facing a lawsuit from the producer of the late rapper’s song with BTS singer Suga, “Girl Of My Dreams.”

According to documents obtained by TMZ in July, Joshua Jaramillo says he worked on the posthumous 2021 single and had a deal in place for five percent ownership of the song and one percent of the royalties.
However, he’s now suing for unspecified damages and a full accounting as he claims that he hasn’t been paid the full amount of what he’s owed, nor has he been given a breakdown of what the song has made – despite multiple requests.
