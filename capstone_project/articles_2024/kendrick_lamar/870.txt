Drake’s OVO signee Baka Not Nice has seemingly threatened Metro Boomin after the producer told rappers to “pick a side.” amid his ongoing feud with the Canadian superstar.
The 45-year-old MC took to his Instagram Stories on Sunday (March 24) and Monday (March 25), and wrote: “You new [ninja emoji] kill me yall talk like bitches I’ll see any of you [ninja emoji] dolo no phones juss tump box & kick. Come to the back [ninja emoji, three zipper-mouth face emojis].”

In another Story, he added: “Play if you want you know me I’ll clap it.”
A third post read: “Ain’t nothing bigger than the O Nothing #OVOSound.”
He then directly addressed the St. Louis producer’s Tweet, writing: “Pick a side? [ninja emoji] We don’t pick we slide unalive [ninja emoji]s.”
The drama at hand traces back to the release of Metro Boomin and Future’s joint album, We Don’t Trust You, which features a scathing verse from Kendrick Lamar aimed at Drake and J. Cole in addition to numerous lyrics from Future himself that appear to be aimed at his former collaborator.
On the title track, Hendrix raps: “You a n-gga No. 1 fan, dawg/ Sneak dissin’, I don’t understand, dawg/ Pillow talkin’, actin’ like a fed, dawg/ I don’t need another fake friend, dawg/ Can’t be ’bout a ho, ’cause we sharin’, dawg/ In yo feelings, n-gga, why you playin’, dawg?”

Soon after, Metro upped the ante when he Tweeted: “once you pick a side stay there.. #WEDONTTRUSTYOU.”
The super producer later saluted Rick Ross, who appears on the track “Everyday Hustle,” by writing: “EVERYDAY HUSTLE LIKE WILLIAM!!! @RickRoss [fire emojis] [face exhaling emoji].”

While the tweet may well have been a reference to their aforementioned collaboration, some have speculated that it was about Ross unfollowing Drake and siding with Metro and Future in the process.
As for Baka, this isn’t the first time he’s thrown shade at a major Hip Hop figure. Back in 2022, he took aim at Pusha T on “Body & A Face.”

Without mentioning the Clipse member by name, he rapped about once planning to shoot up his concert before alluding to Drake calling off the hit.
“When you go on tour you gon’ have to leave the States/ And then it’s face-to-face/ Noreaga interviews will get you n-ggas laced/ I don’t wanna hear you tryna tell me ’bout mistakes/ Almost lit your show up but we couldn’t find the place/ But Drizzy put me in my place, told me just to wait,” he spit.
