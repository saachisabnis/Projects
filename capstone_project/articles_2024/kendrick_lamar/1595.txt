In a recent twist in the ongoing narrative of hip-hop relationships, Drake may have thrown some subtle shade at J. Cole by reposting a tweet that suggests Jay-Z once ignored Cole’s phone call. This incident has sparked conversations among fans about the dynamics between these three influential artists.
On Tuesday, an Instagram account known as @plottttwistttttt shared a 2019 tweet recounting a peculiar incident where Cole’s phone was allegedly stolen by a fan. The tweet reads: “Remember when J. Cole got his phone stolen out of his pocket by a fan and they called Jay-Z from it but he wasn’t answering so they called from their own phone and he picked up?”
This tweet has resurfaced, drawing attention to the complicated relationships within the hip-hop community.
Although the Instagram account allegedly belongs to Drake, it remains unclear who exactly is running it. This ambiguity adds another layer to the situation, especially considering Drake’s recent activities, including a massive music drop earlier this week.
Historically, Drake and J. Cole have maintained a good relationship. However, the landscape shifted significantly after Drake’s beef with Kendrick Lamar. Following that feud, Cole’s involvement with Kendrick changed the dynamics between him and Drake. Cole was featured on Future and Metro Boomin’s We Still Don’t Trust You, while Drake took some shots at Cole in tracks like “Push Ups” and “Family Matters.”
In “Push Ups,” Drake rapped: “I don’t care what Cole think, that Dot s— was weak as f—.”
Meanwhile, in “Family Matters,” he added: “Cole losin’ sleep on this, it ain’t me.”
These lyrics indicate that while Drake may respect Cole, he is not afraid to express his feelings about the ongoing tensions in the industry.
The resurfacing of this tweet and Drake’s potential shade towards J. Cole raises questions about their future collaborations and friendship. As fans, we can only speculate on how these interactions will shape the landscape of hip-hop moving forward.
