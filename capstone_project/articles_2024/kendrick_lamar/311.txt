Tyler, The Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival is officially returning to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Nov. 16 and 17 to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Although the lineup has yet to be revealed, headliners from last year included The Hillbillies aka Kendrick Lamar and Baby Keem, SZA and Tyler himself. Other acts on the lineup included Lil Yachty, Ice Spice, Clipse, Kali Uchis, Earl Sweatshirt, Rex Orange County, Syd, PinkPantheress, Teezo Touchdown, Kevin Abstract, Dominic Fike, WILLOW, Ravyn Lenae, Turnstile, Khamari, Maxo Kream, Paris Texas, Beabadoobee and more.
The fest will be returning to its homebase at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Fans can register now for pre-sale passes by signing up with a valid phone number and email at campfloggnaw.com/passes. Tickets will go on sale at 12 p.m. Thursday, June 27. Two-day general admission passes start at $345; Two-day VIP passes start at $625; Two-day super VIP passes start at $1,695 and two-day unlimited carnival game tickets start at $150.
Tyler’s tradition is still alive and well, promising carnival games, rides, activations, pop-up shops for Tyler’s Golf Wang collection and more at this year’s festival. Camp Flog Gnaw originated in Los Angeles in 2012 and has since risen to popularity with its diverse lineups and carnival atmosphere.
Tyler recently canceled his headlining spots at this year’s Lollapalooza in Chicago and Outside Lands in San Francisco, although he is still set to perform later this year at Austin City Limits in Texas this October.
