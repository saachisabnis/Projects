LOS ANGELES — Like Randy Newman says, it was indeed “another perfect day” in Los Angeles.
For the first time in 36 years, the Dodgers finally got to celebrate a World Series championship with the city and their fans inside Dodger Stadium.
It’s likely an understatement to say Dodgers fans were ready for this moment. After the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in a thrilling Game 5 for the franchise’s eighth title, the streets of Los Angeles went crazy. It feels like the celebration hasn’t stopped since.
DODGERS WIN WORLD SERIES: Celebrate with this commemorative coffee table book!
People lined up for the parade in Downtown Los Angeles as early as 3 a.m. local time. Public transportation – the only way to get into the city with all the road closures – was filled to the brim and lines at Union Station were starting the moment people stepped off the train.
Los Angeles patiently waited and burst when it was time to shine. Even the players, who play for the team with the highest attendance in the sport in one of the most populated cities in the country, were caught by surprise.
"I didn't even know this many people existed,” said pitcher Tyler Glasnow.

The scene in the streets of Los Angeles exceeded the expectations of the team. Presumed National League MVP Shohei Ohtani said he was “totally overwhelmed” to see how many fans came out.
As much as the Dodgers wanted to win another World Series to validate their super team and exorcise their postseason demons, it’s not a stretch to say several players and the fanbase wanted a parade more than anything else.
“You guys wanted a parade, we got a parade,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.
Los Angeles couldn’t celebrate the 2020 World Series title because of COVID-19. The team hoped it could maybe have some sort of celebration, but it never came to fruition. Nine Dodgers on the 26-man roster for this year’s Fall Classic were part of the 2020 team, and that doesn’t include those sidelined with injuries like Clayton Kershaw and Joe Kelly.
Now, after four years and several more postseasons full of disappointment, this World Series title may be savored more than the first.
"I've waited for this day for a long time. I waited to celebrate for a long time,” the 17-year veteran Kershaw said. “I'm at a loss for words. I didn't have anything to do with this championship, but it feels like the best feeling in the world."

“We should have had this in 2020, but we're bringing it now,” said Max Muncy.
Once the team made its way back to Chavez Ravine, more than 42,000 people awaited them inside Dodger Stadium to punctuate the celebration. It was done in true Los Angeles style.
The “West Coast Don” Ice Cube came back to perform just like he did in Game 2 of the World Series, and this time he was joined by Roberts, who was clearly having the time of his life rapping and dancing alongside. The team came out to the city’s summer anthem, “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar, and it was punctuated by Newman’s song "I Love L.A." that’s played after every home victory.
“Everyone in this organization has spent their lives waiting for this day, and they are appreciating a lifetime of anticipation today,” said Dodgers CEO Stan Katsen.
But don’t forget why the parade even happened in the first place. And let Walker Buehler, who etched his name into Dodgers lore after getting the final three outs of the World Series, remind you who the Dodgers are.
“World (expletive) champions mother (expletive),” he said.
Utilityman Kiké Hernández reminisced about something he said prior to the 2020 season. He claimed the 2020s would be “the LA Dodger decade.”
“Guess what? Who has more championships than us in the 2020s? Absolutely nobody,” he said.
The decade is about halfway done, and it’s true the Dodgers now have two World Series trophies in five seasons. But several players let it be known they aren’t done adding to the trophy collection anytime soon.
Teoscar Hernández got emotional when he took the microphone, and the crowd let it be known how much they’ve grown to love the person that signed a one-year deal to play for Los Angeles in 2024. When president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman spoke, the crowd chanted “re-sing Teo.”
If Hernández does re-sign with Los Angeles – which he said will be a priority if the team wants him back – much of the core will still be around and the Dodgers will certainly be favorites to be the first repeat champions since the Yankees of 1998-2000. Mookie Betts, World Series MVP Freddie Freeman and Ohtani – who will pitch as well in 2025 – will be back. So will National League Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.
Several pitchers will be free agents, but some have made it known that they want to be back. Hometown starter Jack Flaherty said "I love this city and I never want to leave.”
A constant message from the team Friday afternoon was about wanting to be back in the same position one year from now.
“Let's get ready to run this thing back next year, too,” Roberts said.
However, Betts doesn’t want just one more. Now the only active three-time champion in MLB, he invoked the spirit of LeBron James with the Miami Heat by wanting more. He’s under contract until 2032.
“We got like eight, nine years left. I got to get to at least five or six, right?” he said as he raised his hand. “I got three. I'm trying to fill this hand up.”
