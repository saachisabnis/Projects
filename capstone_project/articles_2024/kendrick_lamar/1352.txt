The owners of the Members Only brand have accused Drake of misleading customers by using the same name as his song title. Drake’s “It’s All A Blur” tour, while successful, has led to legal troubles as JR Apparel, the company behind Members Only, sued his Away From Home Touring company in New York. They claim Drake unlawfully used “Members Only” on tour merchandise without proper licensing.
According to court documents obtained by AllHipHop and Billboard, JR Apparel alleges that Drake’s tour sold T-shirts bearing the “Members Only” mark without authorization, potentially confusing consumers. They accuse Live Nation and Drake of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trademark dilution.
Drake’s Away from Home merch and production company is officially facing a trademark infringement lawsuit from the business behind the Members Only brand https://t.co/FvqFtEWBvX That business, JR Apparel World, submitted the straightforward complaint in NY federal court yesterday pic.twitter.com/KMHBgo3fUa
JR Apparel’s attorneys stated, “The fact that ‘Members Only’ is a song on Drake’s album ‘For All the Dogs’ does not obviate the likelihood of confusion or give Live Nation and/or Drake license to use our client’s MEMBERS ONLY Marks in such a confusing manner, particularly on or in connection with apparel items.”
The lawsuit follows a letter sent to Live Nation on April 1 regarding the alleged infringement. Despite attempts to resolve the matter, no agreement was reached between April 3rd and June 6th. JR Apparel also noted the sale of allegedly counterfeit items on eBay, exacerbating their damages.
JR Apparel seeks damages for trademark infringement and other issues, requesting a court order to stop the sale of merchandise bearing “Members Only.” This legal action coincides with fan-made merchandise related to Drake’s beef with Kendrick Lamar, adding another layer to the situation.
