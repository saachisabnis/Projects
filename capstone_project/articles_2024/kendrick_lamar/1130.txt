Drake has just been immortalized with a wax figure at Madame Tussauds New York. Fresh off of Drizzy’s headline-making beef with Kendrick Lamar, the Canadian rapper now takes a place of prominence in the venue’s new music-themed display. Drake’s wax figure looks quite realistic compared to other less lifelike replicas Madame Tussauds has created recently. Drake’s lookalike has his signature cornrows, and is sporting white Air Force 1s, tie-dyed jeans, and a patterned sherpa jacket over a T-shirt. Drake’s wax figure is making the rapper’s standard OVO sign with his hands, while adorned with a diamond chain, earrings, and a bracelet. 
Drizzy joins wax figures of Beyoncé, Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, and Megan Thee Stallion in Madame Tussauds’ concert-themed exhibit, which captures a wild New Year’s Eve in New York City complete with confetti-filled floors and repetitive countdowns, with loud music and bright lights filling the room.
