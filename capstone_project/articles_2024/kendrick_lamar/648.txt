Big Sean came out hard on his recently released freestyle and it looks like he's going at the triumvirate of Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole on the song.
Big Sean returned with a vengeance on the new freestyle he released via Instagram on Wednesday afternoon (March 20). Some bars in particular find Sean appearing to take a swipe at Drake, Cole and Kendrick.
"I think where I lack most as an artist is consistency/I just haven’t had the energy to compete with enemies," the Detroit rapper spits. "Or y’all so-called bigger three/But every verse I lay, fans love to say, 'Man, n***as is sleep!'"
The lines seem to be a reference to Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole being known as the "Big Three" of rap, deeming them the best rappers alive at the moment. Cole even addressed their status on the 2023 Drake collab "First Person Shooter" off For All The Dogs rapping, "Love when they argue the hardest MC/Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali."
Big Sean's bars come several months after an old Kendrick Lamar song leaked last September that found the Compton, Calif. rapper taking shots at French Montana, Jay Electronica and Big Sean. Some people, however, believe the track was A.I.-generated.
