It's nighttime in America, which means it's time for another edition of Evening Reading.
Welcome, welcome, Shackers. I‚Äôm fresh off a flight from Prague and back this week to deliver your Tuesday Evening Reading. I wish I could say it‚Äôs been fun in the States, but certain trillion dollar companies saw fit to perform their latest trick of making hundreds of jobs and a couple studios disappear. Maybe mass acquisition was a mistake? Either way, this day of posting must end, so here‚Äôs your Evening Reading to close it down.

Seems kind of like Tango Gameworks was trying to tell us something.

Why create anything of value when you could just buy all the good ideas and hoard them?

It fits so well.

Kind of makes it all the more despicable.
After today's news, it makes a lot more sense that not only did Shinji Mikami exit Tango Gameworks, but a priority of his new studio is creating a sustainable pipeline for young devs to launch smaller projects. Honestly? I hope he succeeds. https://t.co/fYUdV2JUne
It feels like Mikami may have seen the writing on the wall. Maybe Ikumi Nakamura, too. Mikami‚Äôs priority at his new studio makes a lot more sense now.

The new DLC for Lies of P looks terrible. Oh wait, it‚Äôs just life.

Don‚Äôt forget Sony had to be bullied by Helldivers 2 fans and the developer itself into not making a really stupid decision that made the game unplayable for regions around the world just a few days ago.
