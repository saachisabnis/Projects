50 Cent is weighing in on Jay-Z’s recent legal troubles.
Amid news that Jay-Z is being accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in a lawsuit filed Sunday, December 8, 50 Cent made a few jokes at Jay’s expense on Monday, December 9, including questioning the status of the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show. Later Monday, he made a quip about Jay attending Monday’s premiere of Mufasa with his wife, Beyoncé, and their daughter Blue Ivy so soon after the accusations emerged.
However, 50 Cent — real name Curtis Jackson — had a more serious reaction to the news during a Monday interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I’m asking for Kendrick. I’m just trying to figure if we’re still doing everything,” the rapper, 49, explained his X post about next year’s Super Bowl halftime show set to be headlined by Kendrick Lamar. (Jay-Z’s Roc Nation has produced the halftime show since 2020.)
50 Cent also predicted that the NFL might end its partnership with Jay-Z (real name Shawn Carter) and Roc Nation as a result of the accusations. “They will fall back … the NFL, they won’t necessarily be associated to that,” he said.
In a lawsuit filed Sunday, Jay-Z and imprisoned rap mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, both 55, were accused of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl at an afterparty that followed the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Both have strenuously denied the claims against them.
Jay-Z said in a statement issued to Us Weekly on Sunday, “My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people.”
“I just hope things are alright for him internally, at the crib,” 50 said, referring to Jay’s statement during his interview with Big Boy. “In the statement, they mentioned his daughter [Blue Ivy] being old enough [to understand]. She’s about 13. So it’s the same age as his kids what [they are] saying he did.” (Jay and Beyoncé share daughter Blue, 12, and twins Sir and Rumi, 8.)
50 Cent, who has been involved in numerous legal battles of his own over the years, also suggested that often with misconduct allegations like the one Jay and Diddy are facing, “It isn’t what you did. It’s what they said you did.”
He added, “The damage is already done by the allegation itself.”

50 Cent was also asked if he thinks Diddy is “cooked” — whether Diddy’s career is over — after he was arrested in September and charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Since his arrest, Diddy has faced multiple civil lawsuits accusing him of rape and other sexual misconduct. (Diddy has denied all wrongdoing.)
“When we think of all of those different allegations, they pile up — he’s cooked,” 50 Cent speculated. “But I don’t know how much of that turns into actually what he’s up against.”
“Public opinion, he’s washed. He’s washed. They washed him,” he added.
