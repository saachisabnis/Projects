Flex scheduling, gives broadcast network the ability to change primetime matchups on what are usually nationally televised games, to give fans a better game to watch, and to attract bigger ratings for the network.
The Week 17 match up this Sunday between the Minnesota Vikings (13-2) and Green Bay Packers (10-4) at U.S. Banks Stadium in Minneapolis has been 'flexed' by FOX.
The game, originally scheduled for a noon kickoff, will now instead kickoff at 3:25 pm Sunday afternoon (still on FOX).
To make room, the game between the Dallas Cowboys (7-8) and Philadelphia (12-3) has been moved up from it's originally scheduled start time of 3:35 pm, earlier to noon.
A win over the Packers on Sunday, followed by another win next Sunday over the Lions in Detroit, would give the Vikings a regular season record of 15-2, and the NFC North crown. Additionally, the Vikes would end up with the overall number-one seed in the NFC, and a first round bye in the playoffs -- along with the home field advantage at U.S. Bank Stadium as long as they keep winning. It's all a tall order, no doubt.
Super Bowl LIX will be played Sunday, February 9th at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Kendrick Lamar will be the halftime performer.
THe Vikings have made four appearances in the big game, coming up short all four times. Only the Buffalo Bills have the same level of futility (also 0-4) among teams that have made it to the title game.
How perfect would a Minnesota Vikings vs. Buffalo Bills Super Bowl be? I mean somebody's gotta win right? Skol!
