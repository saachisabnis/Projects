DJ Quik is contemplating filing a lawsuit against Instagram and similar social media apps for what he says is a violation of his first amendment rights.
As its defined, the First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

After apparently receiving an infraction on Instagram for something he said, Quik took to the platform on Friday (August 16) and threatened legal action.
“I think the time has come for me to file a class action lawsuit against this and other social media platforms for violating my first amendment rights,” he wrote in the post. In the caption, he added: “I said what I said. And after, close this account altogether.”

However, it looks like he may have changed his tune, as hours later he wrote on his story: “My lawyer just told me I’m wasting my time on Instagram.”

In other news, DJ Quik recently revealed he shed tears over Kendrick Lamar‘s explosive ‘Pop Out’ concert in Los Angeles on Juneteenth – but it wasn’t a product of happiness.
Talking to AllHipHop at the 2024 BET Awards, the West Coast legend admitted he was salty that he wasn’t able to attend the show due to a prior commitment.

“I was knee deep in Canada when all that unity happened,” he said, before turning to Problem and adding: “I cried myself to sleep that night in the dumb-ass Hilton hotel looking at you guys. I started hating. What did I tell you?”
Quik was with Snoop Dogg on the night of said concert as part of their summer tour, because of which they two were unable to make it back to Southern California in time to celebrate the West Coast.

He added: “Snoop tried to fly us back for the Pop Out. He tried to charter a jet and it didn’t work out logistically because we would have missed our show in Ottawa, Canada. But we sat there steaming. I was steaming!”
The ‘Pop Out’ went down on Juneteenth at the Forum in Inglewood. In addition to bringing out some of LA superstars such as Dr. Dre, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Tyler, the Creator, YG and Roddy Ricch, Kendrick also brought members of the Crips and Bloods together on stage.
