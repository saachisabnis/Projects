However, he did reveal that he may have planted the seed for the song, which was ranked the fourth greatest diss record in Hip Hop history by DX, in Drizzy’s mind.
“I can clear the air right now,” Daylyt told hosts Elliott Wilson, DJ Hed and Jeremy Hecht. “No, I did not write ‘Back to Back.’ I’ll just put that out there. I’ll leave that in the air.”

He then explained the role he did play in the song’s creation: “Now, what I can say — and I’ll say this publicly — I may have been some inspiration to the concept of the record.
“In the midst of that beef after ‘Charged Up’ dropped, I most definitely was like, ‘Aye, bro. You gotta drop some shit back to back. You need to run some shit back to back to back.’ I just kept saying, ‘Back to back.’ And then that became, I guess, the idea of the record.

“I was like, ‘Don’t give [Meek] no time to reply. Just double up on him.’ And that concept alone turned into an actual record.”
When pressed by co-host DJ Hed about any other songs that he may have helped Drake write, Daylyt kept shtum: “I won’t speak on anything else. Y’all gotta talk to my agents and stuff.”

Some believe that the (since-debunked) speculation of Daylyt’s involvement with “Back to Back” was referenced by Kendrick Lamar on Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That,” where he rapped: “And your best work is a light pack.”
When asked whether he thinks K. Dot was talking about him in his blistering guest verse, Daylyt answered: “Knowing Kendrick and how he raps, he’s very sneaky so I don’t know if he meant it or not. I truthfully don’t know.”

The TDE affiliate previously addressed the ghostwriting speculation on his song “Lyt Skin,” which included several shots aimed at Drake.
“I sat up nights writing, don’t get the credit I deserve / I’m the one sending references, I’m who edit them words / I don’t ask to be credited, I just check for the debit deposit, observe,” he rapped.

“I was being a handyman, Hamburger Helper for the logo / Jumped in the Meek beef just for the promo / I guess this how the show go / When you show low respect for those who respect and neglect you.”
He also called out the 6 God for not inviting him to his mansion parties and ignoring his texts after he began working with XXXTENTACION, who was at odds with Drake before his death.

Despite this, Daylyt revealed on The Bigger Picture that his and Drake’s relationship is solid these days.
“I just talked to Drake not too long ago,” he said. “I didn’t speak to him about none of the stuff that was going on. It was basically about a future rap battle […] between me and some other people.”

He then joked: “I don’t want to say the person’s name because, you know, I’m a big time rapper and I don’t mention them little n-ggas no more.”
The full episode of The Bigger Picture premieres on Saturday (September 28) on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.
