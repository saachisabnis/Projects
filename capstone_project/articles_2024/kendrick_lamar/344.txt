SAN FRANCISCO - Kendrick Lamar and SZA are coming to the Bay Area as part of a collaboration tour announced on Tuesday.
The Grand National Tour will take over Oracle Park in San Francisco on May 29, with the Grammy-winning artists performing at a total of 19 venues across North America.
Prior to their Bay Area stop, two shows are scheduled for Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium on May 21 and 23.
The tour announcement follows Lamar's release last month of his latest album, "GNX," in which he and SZA collaborate on two songs: "Luther" and the final track, "Gloria."
The 37-year-old Lamar has been nominated for seven Grammys, including Best Rap Song for "Not Like Us" and "Like That." 
Sza, 35, is up for two in the Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance categories, both for "Saturn." 
The 67th annual Grammy Awards will be held on Feb. 2.
