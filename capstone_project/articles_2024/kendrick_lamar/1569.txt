Kendrick Lamar fired the latest shot in his ongoing war with Drake on Tuesday by releasing a new track called “Euphoria.”
The two rap superstars have been going at it for around a month, with the Compton native seemingly getting the better of the Canadian superstar.
But while the new track had plenty of bars that left Drake reeling, there was also one hilarious mistake that people couldn’t let slide.
“Ain’t twenty-v-one, it’s one-v-twenty If I gotta smack n—– that write with you,” Kendrick raps. “Yeah, bring ’em out too, I clean ’em out too. Tell Bean that he better stay right with you. Am I battlin’ ghost or AI? N—- feelin’ like Joel Osteen. Funny, he was in a film called ‘AI.’ And my sixth sense tellin’ me to off him”
The line was supposed to be a shot at Drake for his use of multiple ghostwriters as well as AI. Kendrick used wordplay to compare one of Drake’s writers to Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense and A.I. Artificial Intelligence fame.
There’s just one problem.
Kendrick confused Osment with televangelist and noted scam artist Joel Osteen.
It didn’t take long for the jokes to start flying on social media.

I’m sorry but I cannot stop laughing at Kendrick mixing up AI/Sixth Sense child actor Haley Joel Osment and televangelist grifter Joel Osteen
