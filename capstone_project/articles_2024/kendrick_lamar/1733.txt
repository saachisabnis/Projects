Doechii‘s new tape is evoking the same energy Kendrick Lamar did with his debut project Section.80 – so says Top Dawg Entertainment‘s Top Dawg.
The Florida-bred rapper released her new mixtape Alligator Bites Never Healon Friday (August 30). Clearly, she has quite the fan in her TDE boss, as he noted the project makes him feel the same way the label’s breakout superstar did in his early days.

“@doechii Alligator Bites Never Heal out now !! What are your thoughts & standouts so far ? I have the same feeling I had when KDOT dropped Section 80,” Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith wrote in an Instagram post.  “She’s 1 of those ones 4sho !!!! #TDE20 #TimelessClassicMusic”

Top Dawg isn’t the only TDE member that Doechii has impressed with her new effort, as it’s all ScHoolboy Q has been spinning as well.
“Just Here to say DOEcHii… dats all I care about at da moment,” he wrote on X the day the tape dropped.

In other news, Doechii recently revealed that she feels more comfortable in the LGBTQIA+ community, as a queer woman herself, than in the Hip Hop community.
Talking to Rolling Stone for Pride Month in June, the “What It Is” creator explained her thoughts.

“No community has uplifted me and made me feel as safe as the gay community, and ballroom culture, of course, is a part of that community,” she said. “I just feel understood in that space, and not all the time in this hip-hop genre do I feel fully embraced, like I do in this bag. I just feel safe.”
Weeks earlier, both Doechii and her “Alter Ego” collaborator JT showed their support to the LGBTQIA+ community with “love letters” on social media, as part of an initiative kicking off Pride Month.
