The Weeknd‘s manager Cash XO has seen his home in Encino, California targeted in a shooting incident that left a security guard injured.
Cash XO (real name Amir Esmailian) was believed to be the target of an attempted home invasion on Monday (April 29) but it is unclear if he was home at the time.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the incident took place in the early hours of the morning, with multiple callers contacting police to report a shooting at Jayden Lane in Encino.
While Cash was recently dissed on Drake’s “Push Ups,” police believe the incident is unrelated and was an attempted robbery of the music executive’s mansion.

A security guard was shot multiple times during the incident and described his assailants as wearing hoodies and surgical masks when he phoned the police. He is not in life threatening condition after undergoing surgery.
The wounded guard is believed to be directly employed by Esmailian.
It is not known if Esmailian was home at the time of the shooting but it is believed that at least four people were inside the property when gunfire erupted. Fellow residents in the upmarket neighborhood also reported hearing gunshots.
The attackers did not make it inside the home and their identities are currently unknown as the investigation continues.

The LAPD said in a statement: “The victim (M/B/37 years) was inside a guard shack when he heard several gunshots and discovered he had been struck. The suspects (3 M/NFD) fled from the location. LAFD responded and transported the victim to a local hospital in unknown condition.”
According to KTLA, Esmailian’s house is reportedly on the market for $12 million.

“Y’all n-gga manager was Chubbs lil’ blunt runner/ Claim the 6ix and you boys ain’t even come from it/ And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it/ Cash blowin’ Abel bread, out here trickin’/ Shit we do for bitches, he doin’ for n-ggas/ Jets, whips, chains, wicked, wicked, wicked/ Spend it like you tryna fuck, boy, you trippin’, boy, you trippin,'” he rapped.
