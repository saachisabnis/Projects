Having just scooped the BRIT Award for International Artist of the Year at Saturday night’s ceremony, contemporary R&B powerhouse SZA has been confirmed as the next headliner of BST Hyde Park 2024.
The news follows what’s been a stellar few years the artist, from multiple Grammy nominations and a global arena tour (in support of 2022’s superlative album ‘SOS’), to collaborating with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna.
She’s set to take to the stage on Saturday 29th June - the first of the festival’s three weekends - and will be joined by fellow boundary-pushers Sampha and Snoh Aalegra as special guests. Elsewhere on the lineup, crowds will be able to catch the likes of Elmiene, No Guidnce, Sekou, Hope Tala and more, so there’s plenty to get your teeth into across the day fest’s stacked bill. 
Tickets for SZA’s BST Hyde Park are available here, and you can check out the full lineup poster below.
