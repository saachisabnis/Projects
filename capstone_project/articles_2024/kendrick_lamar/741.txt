Drake and Rick Ross continue their saga of trolling, and Drizzy is going after Ross’ baby mother. Drake took to Instagram on Monday (July 1) to celebrate Canada Day with a carousel of pictures. There, Ross’ baby mother, Tia Kemp, commented on the photos, saying “Drakeeeeee,” to which Drizzy responded, with a heart emoji calling her “My goat.” Ross hopped into the comments with his own remarks, clowning Drizzy for the grooming allegations lodged against him while dissing his baby’s mother, saying, “Pedo vs Granny.”
The post follows the Miami rapper getting into a large fight in Vancouver after his performance at the Ignite Music Festival. During his set, Ross decided to play Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” as he exited the stage. The move prompted a squad of goons to confront the artist. The men pressed Ross and his team as tensions began to flare.
Video footage captures a heated exchange before one of the men sucker punched the rapper, which turned the scuffle into a brawl. Members of Ross’ squad could be seen getting pushed around and falling to the ground as the Canadian goons continued to harass and mock them for their song choice. At one point, the clip shows an MMG affiliate seemingly knocked out unconscious on the festival grounds after seemingly taking a hit from the squadron of Drake fans.
While VIBE was unable to secure an official statement from Rozay or his team regarding the fight, Ross did post a response to his IG Story. On Monday (July 1), Ross posted a picture of himself standing in front of his jet with the caption, “Vancouver, it was fun. Til next time.”
As previously stated, Ross explained where his issues with Drizzy stemmed from. In his Drake diss, “Champagne Moments,” the Biggest Bawse detailed that the Toronto native snaked French Montana with a cease-and-desist.
“I unfollowed you, ni**a, ’cause you sent the motherf**kin’ cease-and-desist to French Montana, ni**a/ You sent the police, ni**a, hated on my dog project/ That wasn’t the same white boy that I seen, ni**a, when we were makin’ them early records, ni**a,” Ross revealed to him on the song’s outro.
