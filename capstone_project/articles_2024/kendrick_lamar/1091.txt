Tray Deee took a moment to address Napoleon's claim that Tupac Shakur stole Snoop Dogg's limelight upon joining Death Row Records. Tray Deee firmly disagreed, asserting that Tupac brought his unique charisma and energy, creating his own space alongside Snoop rather than overshadowing him. Highlighting their collaboration on "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted," he emphasized the synergy between Tupac and Snoop, where both artists shined equally. Tray Deee also touched on how Snoop's knack for reinventing famous tunes added to his vibrant presence in the hip-hop scene. In the discussion, other topics emerged, including criticism directed at Snoop and Daz for a supposed collaboration with someone linked to Tupac's murderâ€”a claim Tray Deee had never heard of.
