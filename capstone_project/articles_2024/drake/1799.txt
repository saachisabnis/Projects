Original story:
PALMER — Alaska State Troopers say they are investigating the suspicious death of a 16-year-old Wasilla girl whose body was found late last week on a powerline trail north of the city.
Troopers identified the girl as Alena Toennis on Monday and in an online dispatch said they were notified of the discovery of her body just before 7:30 a.m. Friday. Evidence at the scene suggested Toennis' death "may be suspicious," they said.
A troopers spokesman declined to provide any additional information on Monday.
Toennis was found near a storage facility along Seldon Road, according to her aunt, Crystal Drake Toennis. The family posted a widely viewed message on social media asking for any additional information "regarding her last moments. Who she was with, what car was she in, any others involved? Was there any suspicious activity in that area?"
Alena Toennis' phone stopped pinging at 1 a.m. Friday, relatives say.
The State Medical Examiner's Office is conducting an autopsy.
