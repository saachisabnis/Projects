Joe Budden is not shy about critiquing another artist’s career, which means he also must know that he opens himself up for someone else to make a similar assessment of his career and some of the controversial things he’s done.
This is what happened Wednesday when Cardi B made it extremely clear how she felt about the popular podcaster.
On the latest episode of “The Joe Budden Podcast,” the former New Jersey rapper claimed that Cardi would never drop another studio album and would essentially be a “feature artist” for the rest of her career.
 “We’ll never get another album again. I’m standing on that… Cardi’s got something dropping with my man Rob[49] on Friday, that’s gonna be crazy. But that’s what Cardi’s gonna be now, just a singles artist,” Budden said. 
He later added, “I’m sure Offset wants Cardi to put an album out. Ay, fellas out there, boyfriends, y’all know that feeling right? When you want your bitch to get a job. You in the house and your b***h won’t leave… ‘Ain’t you got an album to do? Ain’t you got a single?’”
Well, that didn’t go over well with the “Bodak Yellow” rapper, who hopped on Spaces with Budden, claiming that she gave him a lap dance when she was a stripper and that he was high on drugs while she was doing so. 
She said, “I gave you a lap dance two times in f***ing Starlets. You was high as f**k. High as f**k on coke, n***a. I could smell that coke on your breath.”
Cardi later added, “I don’t give a f**k when people talk shit about me. It’s just the fact you always talk shit about me, Joe Budden. Out of nowhere! You would think I did something to this n***a. For the past two years, this n***a has only talked bad things about me. Why?”
Cardi also mentioned the rumors Budden has pushed about Drake and the past critiques he’s had for the Toronto pop star, saying, “I ain’t f*****g Drake, n***a. I ain’t gonna write no nice paragraph. I’ma come at you. I’ma shine that head of yours.”
“You quit on your passion. I’m not gonna quit bro. And stop being a f***ing hater. If somebody gets $400 million for a deal and you talking about, ‘Well, yeah, they gotta tour, this and that.’”
This is in reference to the massive $400 million deal Drake negotiated with Universal Music Group in May 2022. 
In a shocking move, Budden later apologized to Cardi X, writing, “She cursing me smooth out but she still hilarious lol…. I’m going to bed, i apologize to @iamcardib for whatever i did and peace and love to all.”
This is something Budden will likely address again on the next episode of his podcast. We’ll see if he’s just as apologetic when he has a couple of days to sit on it.
