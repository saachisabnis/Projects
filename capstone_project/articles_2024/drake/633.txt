One of the most recent diss tracks to make the rounds of social mdia has been “Like That” from Future and Metro Boomin‘s new album WE DON’T TRUST YOU. Featuring Kendrick Lamar and shots fired at Drake and J.Cole, the song has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 alongside the album, which also debuted at No. 1 with the largest streaming week in history.
According to Billboard the song from Future, Metro and Kendrick is Metro’s first No. 1 song after it landed on the top of the chart. The song ended last week with 59.6 million streams, 5.6 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 9,000 units. The song surpasses Miley Cyrus’ Grammy-winning song “Flowers,” which earned 59.7 million streams in second debut week last January. “Like That” falls behind Taylor Swift’s 2022 song “Anti-Hero.” 
“Like That” is Future’s third song atop the charts which follows “Waitin for U” featuring Tems and Drake as well as “Way 2 Sexy” with Drake and Young Thug. Being that Drake has evidently worked with Future on a new album, the diss track comes as a surprise since fans were unaware of the potential downfall of Drake and Future’s relationship. While neither parties have confirmed if it is truly a diss track, it is hard to deny based on Kendrick’s lyrics. Metro took to X to celebrate the feat writing, “FEELING BLESSED / FEELING GRATEFUL / PUTTING SOMETHING CRAZY TOGETHER WITH THE TEAM TO SHOW APPRECIATION TO ALL THE SUPPORTERS.”
