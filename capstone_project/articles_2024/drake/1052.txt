NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) – The Metro Nashville officers who stopped the Covenant School shooter last March have been nominated for the Congressional Gold Medal.
U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles wrote on X he submitted both Michael Collazo and Rex Engelbert for the prestigious award. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress awards for civilians or non-military members.
Since the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned gold medals as its “highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions,” according to the U.S. Office of the Historian.
