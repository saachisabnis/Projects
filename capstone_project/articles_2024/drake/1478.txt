DoRoad returns with his latest single, “Mileage”, showcasing a fresh side of his artistry and dropping with an official video.
Known for his agile flow, he shifts focus to deliver more introspective lyrics, embracing a softer and more heartfelt tone. The track is built on an instrumental heavily inspired by Sexy Drill and features a recognisable sample from Drake and Sampha’s classic “Too Much”. This choice adds a nostalgic touch while amplifying the emotional weight of his verses.
