CRICKET – THE bucolic hamlet of East Tytherley in the depths of the Hampshire countryside is one of the best village cricket clubs to be found anywhere, even boasting a centuries-old oak tree inside the boundary.
The beauty of the recently mown sward, with its backdrop of green meadows and Lockerly Manor peeping out behind layers of oak, beech, sycamore and lime trees, and its exquisite traditional wooden pavilion, all provided the perfect setting for the Awali Camels’ last match on their latest UK tour.
The Camels, bloodied but bold after two epic encounters with Totton CC and Romsey CC, might have been lulled into a sense of “a win looks easy” as they beheld the peaceful, pastoral panorama basking in glorious sunshine.
East Tytherley might have thought they had made the wrong decision to bat first as they stuttered to 71 in 16 overs on an easy wicket, losing four wickets on the way. Dave Starkie continued his tour bowling form with a fine tight spell, picking up the key wicket of “Hacker” Gray.
Bowling honours went to Steve Turner. His three wickets put the Camels well into the driving seat.
With the departure of Drake (43), the scene looked set for another Camels victory. But suddenly, as if stirred from their slumbers in the balmy 35-degree heat, the locals came to life. It was now a completely different game, and incoming batsmen, ‘Hannibal’ Hayes and ‘Clogger’ Evans, more than lived up to their nicknames.
Both threw caution to the wind and unleashed a torrent of boundaries and sixes to the cheers from the groups of local supporters around the ground.
Camels skipper Tom Wooding used all of his precious bowling resources to try to stem the flow. However, despite the best efforts of Starkie, Guy Parker, Martin Saunders, Fergus Shaw and Ollie Hilton, the runs leapt coming.
The only lull came when young John Edwards, a late replacement for Cobus Grierson, conceded just three runs in his two overs.
In the end, the doughty pair scored at more than 10 an over to post a seemingly unassailable 184 for the Camels to chase in 28 overs.
Worse was to follow. The Camels had a cunning plan to pinch-hit their way into contention. But with more pinching than hitting, the tourists fell way behind the required run rate.
Six Camels wickets had fallen with well over half the overs gone and only 60 runs on the board. Fergus Shaw bravely top scored with 25 and Wooding smashed three fours in successive balls in an attempt to speed things up.
When he fell, attempting another huge hit, the Camels, with just two wickets left, were in danger of losing their proud unbeaten record.
Joining solid left-hander Charles Forward at the crease was Turner. This veteran of every Camels tour since they began in 1995 – 29 in all – has rarely had to don the pads. Invaluable to the team for his bowling and outfield patrolling, it was an unusual sight to see him walking out to try and save the match.
The Camels need not have worried. With Forward stonewalling safely at one end, Turner survived a series of bouncers, in and out swinging yorkers by dodging, prodding and ducking. In fact, he took the whole barrage East Tytherley could bowl at him.
Coming off the pitch unbeaten, the two batsmen were cheered to the cloudless skies of rural Hampshire.
Another tour over, and the Reza Hygiene-sponsored Camels now look forward to their 30th anniversary tour to Wales next summer.
Scores:
East Tytherley CC 184 for 5
Reza Hygiene Awali Camels 109 for 7
