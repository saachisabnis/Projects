Boosie Badazz expressed concerns about the escalating rap rivalry between superstars Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Boosie emphasized that modern rap beefs are deeply personal and far from the playful battles of yesteryears. Reflecting on past feuds, Boosie noted that while many iconic rap battles like Jay-Z vs. Nas ended without severe incidents, todayâ€™s conflicts often escalate, making them dangerously volatile. He criticized the current state of rap, where the focus has shifted from musical prowess to who can deliver the most ruthless insults. Boosie fears that the intense animosity and involvement of local crews could overshadow the legendary careers and legacies of both Kendrick and Drake, urging the industry to remember and celebrate their artistic contributions rather than their disputes.
