In the heart of Cascade, Iowa, a small-town BBQ joint has earned national recognition, securing its place among the top 10 best BBQ restaurants in the United States. According to recent study from BetUS, Moski's BBQ, a relatively new addition to Cascade’s Main Street, has been ranked as the 9th best BBQ spot nationwide in a comprehensive analysis of BBQ joints nationwide. It's nice to say, my hometown has truly taken the BBQ world by storm!
Moski's BBQ, owned and operated by Brice and Shawna Morris, has quickly become a beloved destination for both locals and visitors. With a near-perfect rating of 4.9 on Google reviews, the restaurant has made a name for itself through its commitment to serving up mouth-watering smoked meats and delicious sides. The menu offers a variety of BBQ staples, including pulled pork, chicken, chopped and sliced brisket, chicken hindquarters, and, of course, ribs—one of the main reasons for their acclaim.
But what truly sets Moski's apart isn’t just the food. The atmosphere of the restaurant adds a unique charm to Cascade’s downtown. Housed in a building that was once a Subway, Moski’s BBQ now boasts wood trim on a black exterior, a large garage door that opens onto a spacious outdoor patio, and even gold rain gutters and shiny smoke stacks. It’s a transformation that has not only enhanced the local streetscape but also created an inviting space where the smell of smoked meat wafts through the air, tempting every passersby.
According to BetUS, the ranking was determined by analyzing Google reviews and the price of a typical BBQ meal, including a full rack of ribs, baked beans, and a sweet tea or lemonade. Moski’s BBQ, with its $22 rack of ribs, $3 side of baked beans, and $2 sweet tea, stood out for offering both quality and value.
Brice Morris, who has been the family’s cook for over 21 years and a pit master for the last 15, originally started Moski’s BBQ as a catering business. My family has used his catering service in the past and they always impress. Over the years, the business has grown in popularity, and eventually, Brice and Shawna decided to open the current brick-and-mortar location.
Since its opening, Moski’s has become a staple in the community, serving up their delicious BBQ every Thursday through Saturday. The restaurant’s success has been further highlighted by their presence at notable events like the MLB game at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville and winning at Cascade's Annual Wingfest.
Moski’s BBQ wasn’t the only Iowa restaurant to make the list, but it certainly led the way, with Beaman Grill-N-Pit ranked at #92. Together, these two restaurants put Iowa on the map in the national BBQ scene, a testament to the quality and dedication found in our state’s culinary offerings, and the best of those in my backyard!
Cascade, a town that has seen several new businesses pop up and more than a few updates in recent years, has clearly been spoiled by the addition of Moski’s BBQ. As locals and BBQ lovers flock to this top 10 ranked restaurant, it’s clear that Moski’s BBQ is more than just a place to eat—it’s a new cornerstone of the community.
