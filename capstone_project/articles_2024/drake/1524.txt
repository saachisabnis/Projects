#1 For New Country
Those who knew Trey Burford loved him unconditionally, so his passing left an incredible hole in the hearts of all his friends and family.
His obituary tells the story better than I ever could:
Trey loved his family, friends, work and all things outdoors.  He was an avid hunter and fisherman and truly enjoyed his many adventures, both at home and on trips to various hunting and fishing camps.  A forest, lake, river, field or mountain were like glimpses of heaven to him.  Many a story was shared over the smoke of the barbeque grill or fish fryer.
Instead of spending years with darkness and regret, those friends and family elected to continue to shine his light even after his passing with the Trey Burford Memorial Bass Tournament.
Now, going into its third year, this tournament has provided thousands of dollars in college scholarships to local high school anglers.
Just last year alone, a total of $10,000 in scholarships were distributed to the following:

This is a 2-person team tournament with an entry fee of $250 per team, which includes entry into the Big Bass pot for a cash prize of $2,500.
All anglers are in for the full red carpet treatment and will certainly want to attend the weigh-in at San Miguel for so many reasons including:
Registrations are now being accepted at fishoutlawoutdoors.com and there's a pretty nice incentive to register as early as possible, as the earlier a team registers, the later their check in time will be.
