One celebrity-owned fast food chain is making its way to Goodyear.
California-based Dave’s Hot Chicken, which opened its first Arizona location in late 2022, is expected to open a store in Goodyear next year.
Dave's Hot Chicken already has a location in Phoenix, Gilbert and is opening a store in Laveen. There are also locations in Tucson, Marana and Yuma.
Dave’s Hot Chicken gained widespread popularity after several celebrity investments in the company, including Drake, Maria Shriver and Samuel L. Jackson.
The restaurant started as a food stand in a Los Angeles parking lot. It is named after a recipe by co-founder Dave Kopushyan, who started the restaurant with best friends Arman Oganesyan and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan. Kopushyan previously worked at Thomas Keller's French Laundry.
The West Valley store will be located in GSQ, which is Goodyear's downtown initiative. The area has signed on other popular restaurants like Copper & Sage, the Stillery and Shake Shack.
 Do you agree? This fried chicken spot is the best in Arizona, according to Yelp.
Construction will begin soon on the Goodyear location, which is expected to open sometime next year.
Dave's Hot Chicken specializes in jumbo hot chicken tenders and sliders. A range of heat levels for the sauce is available, with the last one being so hot, it requires a waiver signature.
The restaurant also serves milkshakes and the new Dave's Frozen Slushers.
