MINNEAPOLIS — Kirk Cousins’ time as the Minnesota Vikings’ starting quarterback is officially over, according to his agent.
Agent Mike McCartney said on X Monday that Cousins will sign a four-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons. The 35-year-old was the top free agent QB on the market.
Both Cousins and the Vikings expressed interest in a new deal this offseason, but the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement.
The Vikings are now in a position they haven’t been in since February of 2018 — looking for a franchise quarterback. Jaren Hall, a fifth-round pick in 2023, is still on the roster, along with Nick Mullens, but neither of them inspired confidence in their limited starting time last season. The Vikings will likely turn to the draft and/or the veteran QB market to fill out their depth chart. With the 11th pick in the draft, they are unlikely to land one of the top prospects — Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels — without trading up. On the free agency side, Baker Mayfield, Ryan Tannehill, Jacoby Brissett and Gardner Minshew are the top non-Cousins options. Russell Wilson is also on the market after the Denver Broncos released him.
In his six years with the Vikings, Cousins averaged nearly 3,900 yards, 28.5 touchdowns and 9.2 interceptions per season. He is third in franchise history in passing yardage and second in passing touchdowns.
Cousins has also been incredibly durable, with last season being the only one in which he missed significant time due to injury. He suffered an Achilles injury in week eight and missed the remaining nine games of the year.
In 2018, Cousins signed a three-year, $84 million contract with the Vikings after playing on the franchise tag for two years in Washington. He signed an extension with the Vikings in 2020, and another in 2022. The Vikings won the NFC North just once with him at quarterback and won just one playoff game.
