Commanders still haven't complied with the Rooney ruler per @TomPelissero https://t.co/rDrCjjkN7r
They will be talking with Aaron Glenn early next week.  No need to panic here.
Howell also knew him prior to this because of the NC ties. FWIW Said he enjoyed working with him during the Senior Bowl. https://t.co/eNQTaPbRs0
Welcome to Philly, Coach Fangio!#FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/MtIK5ECjDa
Vic Fangio is officially the Eagles defensive coordinator, the team announced.A year after Fangio left Philly as a consultant, Nick Sirianni ends the saga by landing Fangio days after he parted ways with the Dolphins.
Day 1 of @ShrineBowl practice notes:- OG Christian Mahogany (BC) is easily the top OL in attendance. Displayed real power in 1-on-1 action- WR Malik Washington (UV) has that quick twitch that shows up on film- Noise that WR Tulu Griffin (Miss St) can go sub-4.3 in Indy
In the best vs. best to finish today's practice, South Dakota State G/C Mason McCormick showed off his hand/anchor strength.The shove and stare to finish...   pic.twitter.com/CHAZvJgWww
#Virginia WR Malik Washington had several impressive reps today, including maybe the catch of the day. Clean win at the snap and then shows off the body control and tracking skills to finish. pic.twitter.com/luZXyg903m

Flashed plenty today at Shrine practice! https://t.co/ptjY7r7ZpO pic.twitter.com/NDT32vxSdI
Spent some time today at OL Masterminds with the great @BigDuke50 (story coming later).Zach Frazier was RUNNING on the treadmill while I was there. The same Zach Frazier who broke his leg on November 25! Crazy recovery. He is the top center in the draft for several teams.
The Commanders had a meeting/interview with Solomon Bryd at the Hula Bowl.  Another meeting at the E-W shrine is very possible. https://t.co/DW444Mhpvj
Mentioned David White as a late round prospect for the Commanders on yesterday's @BleedingBurgPod. I got the school wrong - he played for Western Carolina U. & not Appalachian St.I've hiked the mountains of western NC extensively and all those schools look the same to me, lol. https://t.co/p9fpUNh2eb
Drake Maye is a frustrating watch. Has regular sequences where he'll throw behind a WR on a slant or high and behind a swing pass to the RB forcing them to make tough adjustments just to secure catch, then throw a 40-yard dime down the field on the next play
The accuracy and ball placement is very inconsistent. Biggest concern with his game.
Here's a mins worth of examples of Maye's accuracy issues either missing receivers or forcing them to make adjustments they shouldn't have to. Note - This isn't to say I dislike Maye as a prospect. Plenty of positives in his game. Just showing examples of my concerns https://t.co/hC1CEntdML pic.twitter.com/wBUyjnlbUJ
NFL Combine for QBs is March 1. Mark your calendar.
Congrats! #Chiefs Kadarius Toney had a baby girl tonight, his first child. He's also dealing with a hip injury and will not play tomorrow against the #Ravens pic.twitter.com/M3NjdKAfXc
Zach Ertz will not play for Lions vs. 49ers https://t.co/liMcZqbkcd pic.twitter.com/4O7Hg5KkT7
Wild: The average length of #Chiefs Patrick Mahomes TD passes:2019:  17.3 air yards2020: 13.0 air yards2021:   8.5 air yards2022:  4.5 air yardsLast season Mahomes threw 41 touchdownsOnly ONE traveled more than 19 yards (h/t @SharpFootball) pic.twitter.com/84d29V88F8
Here’s why Morgan Moses got fined: He somehow ended up with a photographer’s camera after the TD. (Props are banned.) pic.twitter.com/K4bxNBxbkB https://t.co/EhsMgcTA2b
I remain convinced THIS is where they’ll make their first attempt to please fans. While sticking with the name for a bit. Maybe the same logo, too. A new look that more closely resembles the old, & winning, could make the name issue far less of a thing. https://t.co/1ySXMljGq7
Biases aside, they have one of the best and deepest uniform closets in the league to grow inspiration from. https://t.co/vsVEDUWHTq pic.twitter.com/qIwVSwRptX
This seems like something that will be very unpopular with those that care about this stuff. https://t.co/mewCx28DF2
They had the look right in the early-to-mid 2010s. Ideally I'd have these set as my home, road and alternate uniforms. Only change I'd make with previous road uniform is a blue bill on blue road cap. pic.twitter.com/2pZC2gpTtu
The only thing a 7-37 team should be doing to any poor soul stuck with covering them is holding a testimonial dinner for him. #Wizards https://t.co/sSGXRZyaOI
