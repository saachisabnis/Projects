Drake’s NOCTA line with Nike is once again stirring up sneaker buzz as the “Rattan” colorway of the Nike Hot Step 2 makes its way to the forefront. British rapper Nemzzz recently gave fans an exclusive first look at the upcoming release via Instagram Stories, showcasing the earthy tones that will undoubtedly become a staple this fall. With its minimalist yet captivating design, the “Rattan” is poised to make waves in both streetwear and sneaker culture.
The shoe’s defining feature is its synthetic leather upper, drenched in a sandy beige hue that delivers a neutral but polished look. The molded upper gives the sneaker a futuristic edge, while 3M reflective accents are carefully placed to catch the light, offering a sleek contrast to the matte finish. The subtle shine of chrome details adds an extra touch of sophistication, making this pair ideal for sneaker enthusiasts who appreciate understated elegance.
NOCTA’s signature branding is present on the tongue and sock liner, tying the shoe back to Drake’s distinctive style. It’s a clean, streamlined silhouette with Nike’s reliable Air-sole cushioning in the heel, ensuring comfort that lasts from day to night. The neutral palette of the “Rattan” allows for effortless styling, whether you’re pairing them with NOCTA apparel or your favorite everyday fits.
Set to drop later this year, the Nike Hot Step 2 “Rattan” is expected to be a hit among those who favor a more refined take on streetwear. The combination of subtle colorways with reflective finishes makes it perfect for anyone looking to upgrade their fall sneaker rotation.
For fans of NOCTA and Drake’s expanding footwear catalog, this new offering represents the seamless blend of fashion-forward design and athletic comfort. Keep an eye out for its release via Nike’s SNKRS app and select retailers.
