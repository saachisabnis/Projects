Yung Joc returned for another sit-down with Shawn Prez. First, the rapper and radio host talked about the ongoing rap battle between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. While some have found themselves engaged in the feud, Joc gave a different opinion and admitted that he grew tired of the beef very quickly. Though he expressed his respect for both artists, he criticized the battle for escalating into gossip and personal attacks. The former Bad Boy artist also reacted to updates on Diddy's legal issues, including the mention of 50 Cent's baby mother. Joc also talked about NBA Youngboy's prescription fraud case, Jeezy's divorce from Jeannie Mai, and much more.
