The second-round pick is officially out for the season. The corresponding move was to sign S Tracy Walker
The San Francisco 49ers announced that they’ve placed Drake Jackson on the reserve/Physically Unable to Perform List. Per ESPN’s Field Yates, that means his 2024 campaign is over. That’s the case when you’re placed on the Reserve/PUP list during training camp.
If Jackson had made the final preseason cuts, and the 49ers had placed him on the Injured reserve, they could’ve opened his practice window after four weeks, and Jackson would have been able to return at any point after that 21-day window.
It’s unlikely that the 49ers were counting on Jackson to contribute this year after his injury. Here’s what Kyle Shanahan said about Jackson ten days ago:
“Anytime you do that type of surgery, those are big surgeries. They’re tough to come back from & you never know how they’re gonna react. We always know it’s a possibility to take a long time & it’s taking a long time.”
The corresponding move was to sign safety Tracy Walker, which was reported by The Athletic’s Matt Barrows on Wednesday evening. Walker could be insurance for Talanoa Hufanga, or rookie Malik Mustapha—who limped off the practice field during the first team period on Wednesday.
