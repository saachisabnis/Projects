As the first quarter of the 21st century winds down, Billboard is celebrating the biggest names in music from the past 25 years. Drake secured the No. 4 spot on their list of the 25 greatest pop stars, outranking heavyweights like Kanye West (No. 7), Nicki Minaj (No. 13), and Lil Wayne (No. 21).
The Canadian superstar’s influence is undeniable. With 13 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 singles, 13 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, and 39 Billboard Music Awards, his achievements are in a league of their own. Billboard points out that only The Beatles have matched his feat of 13 chart-topping singles and albums.
Drake also dominates in total career Hot 100 entries, with a record-breaking 338 songs, a milestone he hit in 2020 and continues to grow. He holds additional records on the chart for the most Top 40 hits (206) and Top 10 hits (78).
Beyond his numbers, Billboard also highlighted Drake’s transformative impact on music. Breaking onto the mainstream scene in 2009, he reshaped hip-hop by blending genres and bringing introspective themes to the forefront. Billboard described him as an artist who “never really ‘went pop’; he simply always was pop,” effortlessly merging his hip-hop identity with widespread appeal.
