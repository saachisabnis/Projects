These are of the miniature railway in Stratford Park run by the Stroud Society of Model Engineers.


  The first three are of an L.N.E.R A3 4-6-2 named 'Papyrus' built by Paul Wilkinson (in the all blue overalls).


  One of the photos shows the partially built tunnel.


  This was made using bricks reclaimed from the end arches of the viaduct that carried the Midland Railway as it entered the Stroud terminus over Wallbridge.


  The last photo is of a nearly completed steam loco built by Mark Drake.


  The photos taken in 1984 and appeared on Stroud Area Photographs and Cotswold Picture Postcards where they were posted from a collection by Alan Davis.

As a subscriber, you are shown 80% less display advertising when reading our
                    articles.
Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local
                        services. 
These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local
                        community.
It is important that we continue to promote these adverts as our local businesses need
                    as much support as possible during these challenging times.
