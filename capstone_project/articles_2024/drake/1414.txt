Drake announced he had finished his feud with Kendrick Lamar and was preparing for a shift towards "summer vibes," exciting fans of hits like "Controlla" and "Passionfruit." While Drizzy didn't come out on top in the K. Dot battle, he has always been known for his chart-topping tracks. However, the excitement for the summer vibe theme has waned. The 6 God surprised everyone by releasing a collaborative cover of the Plain White T's song "Hey There Delilah," now titled "Wah Gwan Delilah." Adding to the complexity, this song is actually a remix of a cover that was originally performed by the artist Snowd4y. Drake took a page from the Soundcloud era by jumping on a track that was already gaining traction. The choice of song is puzzling, particularly as Drake heavily uses Autotune on his vocals and replaces the original lyrics with Toronto slang. While his use of slang has led to successful songs in the past, this particular track is not defensible. "Wah Gwan Delilah" is likely to be ammunition for Drake critics for a long time. The backlash on social media towards "Wah Gwan Delilah" is understandable. Fans are eager to understand Drake's current direction and whether he will ever fully recover from the Kendrick Lamar feud. Many find it hard to believe that Drake, after such a high-profile battle, would struggle with his music, but this release is universally considered subpar. One user expressed disappointment in the track, writing, "Drake dropped that awful song 'Wah Gwan Delilah' with the heavy Toronto accent," and added, "We can't ignore the decline." Another user was surprised by Drake's sudden drop in musical quality, tweeting, "Drake is unbelievable. He just went through a massive rap beef and now puts out this disappointing track."
