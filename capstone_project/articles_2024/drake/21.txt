Golden State Warriors player Steph Curry has seemingly had enough of Kendrick Lamar’s epic Drake diss track “Not Like Us.” After the American team defeated Serbia 105-79 on Wednesday, the arena DJ played the song over the loudspeakers at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi.
In a now viral clip, Curry can be heard lamenting: “Damn with this song. It’s not the only song in America.” However, LeBron James retorted with “I love it” as he gathered his teammates.
Toward the end of the clip, shooting guard Anthony Edwards can be seen dancing to “Not Like Us.” The song debuted at No. 1 in May for a week and spent the next eight weeks in the Top 10. This week, “Not Like Us” managed to get Lamar his first multi-week Hot 100 No. 1 as a solo artist.
The song has received 54 million streams and 40 million radio airplay audience impressions. Hip-hop legend and producer Jermaine Dupri chimed in on social media about Curry’s reaction to the song’s cultural dominance.
On Instagram, Dupri wrote: “I just saw Steph’s reaction to the Kendrick record and I thought it was very ironic because what he is feeling (Pause ) is a record impacting the streets and this new generation is not use to that, I’m sure many of yall don’t understand what I’m saying.”
In the video, he expanded on this sentiment. “The goal in hip-hop used to be impact, not sales, not charts—impact. How hard you could impact the streets,” Dupri explained. “That’s no longer the goal and to me that is the sole reason why rap isn’t what rap used to be because n****s don’t care about impacting the streets no more.”
Despite whose side you’re on, the fact of the matter is “Not Like Us” has had a crazy run and will continue to dominate playlists all summer long.
