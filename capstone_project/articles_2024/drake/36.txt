Wayne Northrop, who originated the role of Detective Roman Brady on Days of our Lives, has died. He was 77. Northrop was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s six years ago, according to a statement obtained by People. “He took his last breath in the arms of his family,” his wife, actress Lynn Herring Northrop, wrote. “A husband for 43 years, the best dad ever to his two boys, Hank and Grady, and a rancher who loved his cows and was a friend to many.” Herring Northrop also thanked the Motion Picture and Television Home “for taking such great care of him.”
Northrop was born in 1947 in Sumner, Washington. Aside from his roles on Days of Our Lives, he is known for playing chauffer Michael Culhane on Dynasty and Rexford “Rex” Stanton on Port Charles. He married Lynn Herring in 1981. Aside from acting, the Northrops owned a cattle ranch and dedicated their time to wildlife preservation and environmentally-friendly farming.
Wayne Northrop was one of three men to play Roman Brady on the long-running soap opera. He played the part from 1981-1984, until he seemingly died in his brother Bo’s arms. Someone believed to be Roman Brady (but actually the mysterious John Black) was then played by Drake Hogestyn from 1986-1991. Northrop returned to Days as the real Roman Brady in 1991, playing the part until allegedly dying again 1994. In 1997, Roman once again came back from the dead, this time being played by Josh Taylor. Northrop is the second Roman Brady to pass this year, as Hogestyn died in September.
