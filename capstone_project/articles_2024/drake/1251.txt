It must be beef season, because Hip-Hop artists can’t stop dropping diss tracks about each other.
First, it was Quavo and Chris Brown, who both dropped multiple tracks accusing the other of domestic violence.
Then, Kendrick Lamar and Drake had a rap battle for the ages where they both dropped tracks accusing the other of some heinous and terrible acts, including domestic abuse and pedophilia. Now that the main event is (seemingly) over, a new duo of MCs wants to be a part of beef season.
On Thursday, The Game alluded that he had a problem with Miami rapper Rick Ross by sharing an AI-generated photo of the rapper running in a police uniform with a bucket of chicken.
He confirmed his beef with the MMG boss later that night by releasing, “Freeway’s Revenge,” a four-minute song where the Los Angeles rapper attacks Ross’ entire character.
The Game rapped about Ross’ weight and even alluded to the recent beef between Drake Lamar.
He rapped, “You twelve lemon pepper wings from a heart attack/ Akademiks, give this n***a an Ozempic starter pack/Kai Cenat hit the room turn that stream on/Ask Budden ‘bout his brief encounter with King Kong/This ain’t the Kendrick beef, my Drac’ sing songs.”
The “Doctor’s Advocate” rapper claims to have some dirt on Ross: “Your baby mama told me that you liked to get peed on/ You a C.O., that’s the last time you had keys on/ And we know you treat Gunplay like he a peon/ And he knows some shit that ain’t cool for him to speak on.”
If Ross drops a diss of his own aimed toward The Game, it’ll be the second the second time he has done so this year.
If you recall, after Drake released “Push Ups,” a track where he dissed Ross and many others, the MMG boss released his track, “Champagne Moments,” hours later in response to the Toronto rapper’s bars. 
In response to the track, Rozay simply posted a video on his Instagram, saying that, “You n****s starving.”
