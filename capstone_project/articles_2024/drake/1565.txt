Quarterbacks went off the board in the first four picks of NFL.com writer Chad Reuter's latest mock draft, with Michigan signal-caller J.J. McCarthy notably landing with the New York Giants after Big Blue traded up from No. 6 to No. 4 with the Arizona Cardinals.
USC signal-caller Caleb Williams went first to the Chicago Bears, followed by LSU's Jayden Daniels to the Washington Commanders at No. 2. Then the New England Patriots selected UNC's Drake Maye before the Giants made their move for McCarthy.
Reuter had the Giants give up second-rounders in 2024 and 2025 to Arizona for the pick.
Quarterbacks going first through fourth could certainly happen. The Bears, Commanders and Patriots all need signal-callers.
Williams is a surefire bet to go to the Bears. There's reports that Daniels may not want to land with the Commanders at No. 2, per ESPN's Adam Schefter, although he did note that "it's been tracking" for him to land at that draft position.
As far as the Patriots are concerned, they could take their quarterback of the future at No. 3 or trade down for a haul and restock a roster coming off a 4-13 season. Here, they take their quarterback of the future in Maye.
At No. 4, the Cardinals don't need a quarterback with Kyler Murray already aboard, but the New York Giants could be moving on from Daniel Jones. Here, they move up to take the best quarterback remaining.
Quarterbacks have never gone 1-2-3-4 in the NFL draft before. Last year saw QBs go first, second and fourth with Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson going to the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts, respectively. This year could lead to a complete sweep at the position for the top four picks, though.
We'll find out soon enough with the draft beginning Thursday in Detroit.
