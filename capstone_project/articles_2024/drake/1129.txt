"Incredible. Now I look back on it and it almost means more than when it happened because it happened so quick, going right into combine training. Looking back, it's something that nobody can ever take away from me."
"When I went to Indiana, they just had a couple options for me and 88 was one of them. I was number 11 in high school, so I liked the double numbers I guess."
"Every now and then I'm just like, 'Man, I'm really in Seattle right now, far away from home, like how did I get here?"
"I want to throw a first pitch at a baseball game. I would love to do that, especially back home in Cleveland. I love the Mariners too."
"At one point in time it was the cheese capital of the world in the 1800s."
"Probably having to watch more not-guy movies on road trips like Parent Trap, I remember was one. Little movies like that when there's three girls in the front of the car. Or when we go on vacation, we weren't doing that many fun activities, we're laying at the pool or the beach the whole time."
"I have a couple. One of mine is for my name. I'm the fifth person in my family with my name. The other one is the states that I've played in, without Washington, maybe I'll get that we'll see. I have Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. I have a tattoo for my mom. It's the Rose Bowl logo because we won the Rose Bowl and my favorite song of all time is "Sandra's Rose," by Drake and I'm my mom's only son, so I've got Reva's Rose."
"I'm all about ball right now. I'm here in Seattle, don't know too many people just keeping to myself. I want to lock in, have a great season, and help out however I can."
"Great people. Great families. You can get a little bit of everything. You get all the seasons, you can get some land, you can get some city, and I just think the people in general are always pretty nice."
"Wrestling, period. The fact that it's just you, if you lose it's on you, if you win it's on you. As a young kid, it creates mental toughness."
"Everyone's story is different. I went to Indiana, transferred to Michigan. I'm out here in Seattle now and had a different path to just getting to college, so run your own race."
"No headphones when I'm warming up on the field, but headphones on the bus and everything."
What are you listening to? "A whole bunch of everything. Classic rock, rap, some chill music, maybe a little house music."
