Iowa may be synonymous with rolling cornfields and charming small towns, but hidden within this heartland state are two of the most breathtaking views in the country. Recently, Pikes Peak State Park and the Loess Hills were celebrated on Mixbook’s list of the 100 Most Breathtaking Views in America. This list, curated from the opinions of 3,000 Americans, highlights the nation’s most photo-worthy spots. The list was created in honor of World Photography Day on August 19th. These Iowa treasures have earned well-deserved recognition for their stunning landscapes—and I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing them firsthand (photos below).
Ranked 47th overall, Pikes Peak State Park, located near McGregor in northeastern Iowa, offers a view that I can only describe as awe-inspiring. The park’s overlook, which Mixbook highlighted, provides a breathtaking sight of the confluence of the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers. Watching the sunrise from this vantage point is an experience I won’t soon forget—the way the early morning light shimmers on the water is truly magical.
During a family trip up Highway 52, we made our way to Pikes Peak State Park, eager to explore its famous trails. The park’s 11 miles of trails wind through scenic bluffs and lush valleys, offering plenty of opportunities to take in the natural beauty. One of my favorite spots is the half-mile trail to Bridal Veil Falls.
The falls are a hidden gem, tucked away amidst the greenery, and the gentle sound of the water was the perfect soundtrack to our hike. For those seeking even more awe-inspiring views, a hike to Point Ann rewards you with a sweeping overlook of the nearby town of McGregor, where you can pause and soak in the beauty of the landscape.
Just when I thought Iowa couldn’t surprise me further, I discovered the Loess Hills, which earned the 87th spot on Mixbook’s list. The hills, especially the Murray Hill Scenic Overlook in Harrison County, offer a distinctive view that left me captivated. The rolling hills and valleys are best seen at sunrise or sunset, when the light creates a dramatic scene that feels almost otherworldly.
Our first visit to the Loess Hills took us on a journey along the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway, a route that winds through this unique landscape. Nestled between the towns of Pisgah and Moorhead, the hills offered a view unlike any other in the state. As we drove in, the land formations, spanning up to 15 miles wide and roughly 200 miles long, revealed themselves in layers of beauty. At the Murray Hill Scenic Overlook, we were greeted with a panoramic view that stretched out for miles—an unforgettable sight that was well worth the drive. We even ventured onto one of Iowa’s Level B roads, a thrilling and slightly nerve-wracking experience that added an extra dash of adventure to our trip.

The Loess Hills are a geological wonder, formed from windblown soils known as loess, creating dunes that rise sharply above the plains. Driving through this landscape, I couldn’t help but marvel at how these hills seemed to emerge out of nowhere, transforming the terrain into something almost magical. The area’s rich history, including evidence of early human habitation, only added to the sense of wonder we felt exploring this unique part of Iowa.

What makes these spots truly remarkable is how they hold their own in a list that includes iconic American vistas like Cape Cod, Niagara Falls, and the Grand Canyon. It’s a reminder that Iowa’s natural beauty, though often understated, is just as worthy of recognition as the country’s most famous landmarks. For me, these places are more than just beautiful landscapes—they’re memories of family adventures, moments of peace, and reminders of the incredible diversity of Iowa’s natural wonders and landscapes.
