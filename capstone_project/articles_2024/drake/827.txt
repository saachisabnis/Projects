Detroit Lions quarterback Hendon Hooker wasn't the only former Tennessee quarterback impressing during Thursday night's NFL preseason slate.
New England Patriots rookie quarterback Joe Milton absolutely wowed on one play against the Carolina Panthers where he showed off his stellar mobility by evading multiple would-be tacklers for a huge ground gain.
Milton's throwing arm is a big reason why the Patriots drafted him in the same year as Drake Maye, but the former Tennessee quarterback's elusiveness as a rusher was on full display with this amazing scramble.
While preseason highlights can sometimes be fool's gold, we have a feeling that Milton may well be capable of plays like this on Sunday.
This thrilling Milton touchdown throw to rookie wide receiver JaQuae Jackson certainly supports that idea.
