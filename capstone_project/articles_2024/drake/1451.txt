MOBO FOUNDER and CEO, Kanya King CBE is urging fans who weren’t able to get to Sheffield for the 26th edition of the awards show to tune in to watch it all on YouTube.
Taking place at the Utilita Arena last night, the awards ceremony saw the likes of Central Cee (Best Male Act and Song of The Year with ‘Sprinter), RAYE (Best Female Act for her album “My 21st Century Blues) and Potter Payper (Album of The Year for ‘Real Back In Style’) emerge triumphant in hotly contested categories.
In a special moment UK living legend Ghetts was honoured with the MOBO Pioneer Award, just before performing his latest single ‘Double Standards’, featuring Sampha.
The event was presented by Babatúndé Aléshé and Indiyah Polack, with Zeze Millz as roaming co-host., performances across the evening came from legends and rising stars spanning genres from UK rap to Afrobeats.
Established in 1996, the MOBO Awards has evolved into one of Europe’s foremost music ceremonies, serving as a pivotal platform for both artists and enthusiasts alike. 
With over two decades of honouring musical brilliance, MOBO stands as a beacon of recognition and celebration, spotlighting outstanding achievements in various genres including Hip Hop, Grime, RnB/Soul, Reggae, Jazz, Gospel, and African music, both from Britain and across the globe.
Little Simz landed the Best Hip Hop Act with Sault claiming the Best R&B Act. 
Ezra Collective continued their upward trajectory by bagging the Best Jazz Act, and Shygirl seized Best Dance/Electronic Act. Bugzy Malone was named Best Grime Act. 
Other memorable performances included Byron Messia, Sugababes, Cristale, and a DJ Spoony-curated UK Garage set added to the excitement. 
King Promise, Camidoh, and Soul II Soul also delivered electrifying performances. 
Sheffield’s own Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill received the MOBO Paving The Way Award for her contributions to athletics and charity work. 
Preceding the ceremony, Sheffield hosted the MOBO Fringe, showcasing Black music and culture through talent showcases, industry panels, and educational activities.
Reflecting on the night, King enthused: “I’m still overjoyed by the celebration of black music and culture we witnessed last night at the 26th MOBO Awards in Sheffield. 
“It’s become an instant classic in MOBO history. Since 1996, MOBO has been an unstoppable force, championing black culture, providing a platform for many unheard voices to be seen and heard, particularly in the city of Sheffield, leaving a legacy that will endure long after we are gone. 
“Together, MOBO and our stellar array of talent elevated the scene to such heights and created a real landmark moment. 
“Our hosts Indiyah, Babatunde and Zeze entertained us with such charisma, humour and passion. I also want to congratulate each and every winner, every nominee and performer, who all gave standout performances. 
“You can watch it all again on YouTube and this Friday evening from the comfort of your sofa on BBC One, Access All Areas with DJ Target taking you behind the scenes. You don’t want to miss it.”
