KALAMAZOO, Mich. â€” Kalamazoo Area Runners and Mitten Running celebrated Thanksgiving with both movement and charity at their 2024 Turkey Trot, and it was not necessarily "may the fastest runner win." 
The trot was a time prediction run, which means participants guessed how long it would take them to cross the finish line, and could win prizes based on how close their guess was. 
"I love this, because you got a nice weekend family time break, and this starts it off with something nice and active and when the weather cooperates like this,"  Jon Deming, Kalamazoo Area Runner's race director said. "It's a great time to get outside and get a little fresh air and exercise before the weekend."
The event welcomed almost 900 runners on Thanksgiving morning, which officials claimed was a post-covid record. 
 Until this year, participation had not been that high since before 2020.  
"It's a celebration of movement and family and coming together for Thanksgiving," Carrie Drake, director of Run Kalamazoo, said. 
Runners enjoyed the festive run followed by refreshments and giveaways from local stores and organizations.
Proceeds from the race go towards next year's event, as well as help support the local Kalamazoo Loaves and Fishes food bank. 
"A lot of families right now struggle throughout the entire year and throughout the holidays, and we want to try to support a local community organization in fighting food insecurity," Drake said.
