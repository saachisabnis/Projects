ABINGDON, Va. (WCYB) — The Whole Family Approach is a pilot project funded by the Virginia General Assembly in the 2020 and 2019 budget to provide one-on-one coaching and support for the entire family.
Coaches work with families on things like budgeting and goal-setting to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty.
Lilly Mourning is a single mom of 3 living in Bristol, Va. In 2020, she didn't have a job and her car was constantly breaking down. Now she owns her first home and a brand new car, thanks to the Whole Family Approach program at People Inc.
In United Way of Southwest Virginia’s service area, the number of ALICE households is higher than in the rest of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The ALICE rate, combined with a poverty rate of 19%, shows that as many as 51% of households in our region cannot afford the basic cost of living.  
The communities the program typically serves are single moms with 2-4 children in the home.
"Our overarching goal is to end generational poverty in our communities," said the Coordinator of Whole Family Approach Rhyli Drake.
Mourning said she has faced many challenges in her life, but credits the whole family approach at People Inc. for turning her life around.
Mourning worked with her Whole Family coach on setting personal goals for her entire family.
Her son was diagnosed with epilepsy when she started the program, she said she wouldn't have known the resources available for her son if it wasn't for this program.
Lily told News 5 that as a mom, she was scared to seek out help, but added she's thankful she did.
