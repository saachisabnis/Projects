It is New Year’s Eve as I write this. I was born nearly 50 years ago, at the Rockland Hospital.
How to reflect on nearly 50 years? Well, it seems like a very big number. And I am only turning 49, by the way.
I have written about growing up here, in the old house at the top of Sleepy Hollow. With my brothers, one older, one younger. With my parents, two people who chose a lifestyle for their family which my brothers and I continue to reap the benefits from.
I have written about the pull to leave as I grew older, the same pull that is upon my own adolescent children. This is a small place.
Both my wife and I took the last week off, though I will say that her employer is a bit more generous with leave than mine, self employed as I am. We didn’t do much, and that was wonderful. 
She did decide that we needed to get away from the teenagers for a night, and set us up with a room at the Samoset, a survivor of the once ubiquitous “Rusticator” resorts that dotted this state. I will recommend to any of you looking for something to break up the monotony of a Maine winter, just spending a night in one of our local year-round hotels is well worth it. Room service AND a different view from your windows!
With both of us available during business hours, we decided to finally set the kids up with checking accounts and debit cards, both to help them be more financially aware and as a way to check the seemingly constant requests for us to buy them things. They can manage their own money and stay out of ours!
While at the Camden National branch next to Hannaford, we seemed to run into people we know every couple minutes. We chatted with one of the branch employees about our sons’ basketball team, and several people stopped and said hi while we sorted through all the signatures needed to hook the children up with easy access to their money. The man helping us with the paperwork talked about the Lincolnville Beach Bonfire, and how it has inspired him to join the Lincolnville Volunteer Fire Department — not sure how I should take that….
This is a small place.
And if you are from here, there will always be a sense of connection.
An old friend is in town with his family from China. He left many years ago, and now returns to show his wife and young son his old haunts, a place very different from his son’s native Wuhan. I have another close friend who returns every summer. She loves Maine, recognizes all the reasons she can never live here again, but still feels the pull.
One of the books I received for Christmas is The Lobster Coast, by Maine author Colin Woodard. I am only a third through so far, but he does an amazing job describing the Maine character, our prickliness and suspicion of outsiders, and what it takes to overcome this. 
So many of our most active residents are new arrivals and long time summer folk. People who chose to be here. Will there be tension? Of course, but this can be overcome. Just be patient with us, let us get to know you, give us time. 
In The Lobster Coast, Woodard talks of a certain “classlessness” that exemplifies Maine, particularly the more rural environs. The million dollar mansions still often abut old single wides, and your financial profile means far less than whether you volunteer at the church bake sale or serve on a town board. Or clean up trash on the side of the road or are polite at Drake’s Corner Store.
Lincolnville is an amazing place. Ma, local historian Diane O’Brien, would be the first to tell you that nothing much has happened here of importance. Just people living their lives. For generations upon generations, the native Wabanaki people came here to fish and feast on clams and mussels and oysters. Then came the early white settlers, divided between those who settled inland and those who were granted land on the coast. Farmers and fishermen, just trying to get by.
That is what we do here, we get by. 
I believe this marks my 52nd column writing This Week in Lincolnville. If you have been reading along, I assume you have realized I am not my mother. But I hope that I have been able to continue her legacy. I have received so many wonderful messages from readers, and I am always happy to receive additional feedback. Reach out to me at ceobrien246@gmail.com. I wish everyone a very happy New Year, and may it bring peace and contentment. Keep doing good in your community and in the world. Be kind to you.
