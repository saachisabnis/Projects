T.I.  has released “LLOGCLAY,” a new single featuring NBA YoungBoy, from his upcoming final album, Kill The King. The song is a tribute to his late brother, manager, mentor and friend Clay Evans, who died last year and had a significant influence on T.I.’s decades-long career. 
In memory of Clay, a mural was installed at T.I.’s Trap City Cafe in Bankhead, Atlanta last month. T.I. recently expressed on social media, “What we built as a crew, will never be erased.”
It’s been an eventful week for the multifaceted artist as he balances roles as a rapper, comedian and entrepreneur. His week began with a performance at Netflix’s “Netflix Is A Joke Comedy Fest,” and on Wednesday (May 8), he received an ASCAP Pop Award for his contribution to Drake and 21 Savage’s “Rich Flex,” which samples T.I.’s “24s.” He wrapped up the week with a performance at the LA County Fair and will soon head to Kazakhstan for an arena show next week.
Expect more music, movies and entertainment from T.I., the King of the South, throughout the year. As Tip puts it, “U DIGGG.”
