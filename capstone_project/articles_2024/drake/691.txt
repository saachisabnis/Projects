When it comes to losing large sums of money on sports, Aubrey Drake Graham has made an art out of it. And the God's PlanÂ hitmaker crafted another masterpiece Saturday when he bet $450,000 on Israel Adesanya to beat Dricus du Plessis in their UFC 305 middleweight title fight.
Drake would have won a payout of $855,000 on the bet, which he posted to Instagram with a caption that said "Always with Izzy." But true to form, he lost.
Du Plessis retained his title with a submission in the fourth round.
To be fair to Drake, he wasn't alone. Though du Plessis was the reignging champ, Adesanya was the -120 favorite. He had attracted 70% of tickets on a winner and 81% of the handle at BetMGM.
However, Drake joining in on the action should have been a sign for bettors to abort the Adesanya ship. The loss continued a trend of losing that's seemingly accelerated since his high-profile beef with Kendrick Lamar. It's at least the second time he's lost a bet on Adesanya.
Du Plessis couldn't pass on the opportunity to thank Drake for his contributions.
