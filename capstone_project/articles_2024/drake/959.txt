I'm saving big bucks in Yakima, and you can, too!
As the cost of everything keeps going up and up, it can feel challenging and honestly, overwhelming, trying to get goods, services, and other items.
Washington State has one of the highest rents in the country, and we also are grappling with new taxes being added here and there for everything from gasoline to property taxes.
One way that I've noticed people are actually SAVING money on products and services in Yakima is by spending their money wisely and incorporating some ingenuity when it comes to purchases.
You don't HAVE to buy everything brand new: there are some things you can buy that are refurbished or that have only been used once, twice, or just a few times.
Instead of buying the latest X-Box, look elsewhere to buy it used. Instead of driving down to Tri-Cities or Seattle to get the latest expensive gadgets, clothes, shoes, accessories, etc., ask people on your social media page to see who's got just what you need. You'll get it at a fraction of the price, and sometimes, free if that person was already looking to give that item away anyway!
Before I share with you SEVEN money-saving hacks to use in your life, here's another great tip from me to you: Instead of spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, why not take short "staycations" and spend your money locally near the Yakima Valley by renting an Airbnb, Vrbo, bed & breakfast, or casino hotel?
