DES MOINES, IOWA (September 26, 2024) — Governor Kim Reynolds has announced the appointment of Christine Hensley to the Iowa Board of Regents.
Early in her career, Hensley worked closely with developers on affordable housing projects across the state of Iowa as a business development manager for Midwest Housing Equity Group. Hensley also previously served as Vice President of Community and Government Affairs for Bank of the West after acting as a Des Moines city council member for 24 years.
Hensley has served as president of the Iowa Student Loan Corporation, Iowa League of Cities, and the Metro Advisory Council among other boards. She currently serves as chairperson on the Horizon Science Academy governing board. Standing out from her list of honors, Hensley was inducted into the Iowa Women Hall of Fame in 2017.
“Chris is a remarkable person who has shown time and time again what it means to be a true leader in her community. Across her long and accomplished career in education, business, and elected office, Chris has proven she has the skills and innovative spirit necessary to work alongside our regent universities in the pursuit of academic excellence for our students,” Gov Reynolds said. “I’m confident she will work collaboratively with her fellow board members to ensure graduates are prepared for success in Iowa’s diverse economy.”
“I am honored to be appointed to the Iowa Board of Regents. I appreciate the confidence Gov Reynolds has in me with this appointment,” Hensley said. “I look forward to learning from my fellow board members and working with them to ensure our universities are able to provide outstanding education to the citizens of Iowa.”
Hensley attended Drake University and St Joseph Academy. She was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Grandview University in 2017.
Hensley’s appointment is subject to Senate confirmation.
