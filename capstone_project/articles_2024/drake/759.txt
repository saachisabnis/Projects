Miami had its first chance in the second minute when debutant Nicol√°s Freire sailed a header over the bar. The Argentine defender signed on loan from Liga MX side Pumas UNAM for the entirety of the 2024 MLS season.
Another great chance came in the 18th minute when Lionel Messi played Luis Su√°rez in the middle of the pitch. The forward then passed it out wide to Deandre Yedlin. The right back took it down the line and sent a beautiful cross to Diego G√≥mez right on the penalty spot. The Paraguayan international miss-hit the ball, and the opportunity was squandered.

Something interesting that happened Thursday night was when referee Rubiel Vazquez announced his decision to the crowd and television audiences after the VAR check. In the 21‚Ä≤ minute, there was a potential penalty as Su√°rez went to ground in the box.
Vazquez did not call a penalty but was told to halt play so a check could be done. He was instructed to go to the monitor and check the play out himself. After reviewing the play, the ref turned on his microphone and announced that it was not a penalty. It will be interesting to see how this works out in league play this season.
Newell‚Äôs best chance of the first half came in the 29‚Ä≤ minute. The forward was one-on-one with the goalkeeper after brilliant triangle passing opened up the Miami defense. Drake Callender made a great save and kept it level.

Messi‚Äôs best chance of the night came in the 31‚Ä≤ minute. He went on a solo run in between the Old Boys‚Äô defense and curled the ball just wide of the post.
The first chance of the second half came in the 51‚Ä≤ minute for Newell‚Äôs Old Boys. The Argentine side went on the attack and forced a great save from Callender. The goalie parried it right onto the path of Esteban Fern√°ndez, but the midfielder was unable to control the ball and it rolled out of bounds.
In the 64‚Ä≤ minute, the Herons would get their first goal from substitute Shanyder Borgelin. The Haitian international leaped over the Old Boys defense on a corner kick and headed it home.

Inter Miami‚Äôs Yannick Bright was subbed out 71‚Ä≤ after picking up a knock in his right knee. He was the No. 15 overall pick in the 2024 MLS SuperDraft from New Hampshire University. The Milan native had an excellent game filling in for World Cup winner Sergio Busquets. The Herons hope the injury isn‚Äôt anything too serious as he can potentially have a big role in the upcoming season.
Miami would give up its lead in the 83‚Ä≤ due to a bad pass from Lawson Sunderland. Center back Ryan Sailor tried to win the ball back from Franco D√≠az, but the midfielder pounced on the opportunity and scored the equalizer.
