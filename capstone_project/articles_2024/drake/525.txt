The Toronto rapper seems to be moving on from his beef with K. Dot.

	On Wednesday night (June 5), Drake removed the rest of his Instagram posts related to the Kendrick Lamar beef and posted a carousel of stoic contemplative pictures of himself. 

	The photos came with a vague caption that read, “The only yes man around me is my Rolex dealer.” While it looks like it’s back to business for Drake as he seems to be moving on and focusing on what’s next, the post does leave us with more questions than answers.

	Since the battle with Lamar has died down, the Toronto rapper has been featured on two songs. First, he assisted friend Sexyy Red on her song “U My Everything,” which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 44, where he raps over “BBL Drizzy” for a portion of his guest verse. Then, he gave Canadian parody rapper Snowd4y the greenlight to release their Plain White T’s “Hey There Delilah” Toronto slang remix “Wah Gwan Delilah.” 

	










	Recently, Gordo aka DJ Carnage posted a picture on social media with Drake asking, “you guys ready for summer 2024…”
Gordo reveals he was trolling about new summer music with Drake 💔"I am being completely honest, I went over to his house cause I ran out of milk, so I went and got  2%, whole, Goat milk. He has everything. So I went & I just took that photo just to f**k with people [Laughs]." pic.twitter.com/GQnIfqyGBB

	However, the DJ and producer walked that photo back in an interview with Complex claiming it was a troll job. “I am being completely honest, I went over to his house cause I ran out of milk, so I went and got 2%, whole, Goat milk. He has everything. So I went & I just took that photo just to f—k with people,” he told the outlet. Gordo worked closely with Drake on his dance-adjacent album Honestly, Nevermind where he produced five of the project’s 14 tracks.

	Kendrick, on the other hand, still has links to his diss tracks up on his X and Instagram, and just announced a concert in LA for the upcoming Juneteenth.
