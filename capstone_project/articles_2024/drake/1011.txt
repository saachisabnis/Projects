Summer is the perfect season to host vibrant and memorable events at your property and to increase revenue this summer. This means you need to put your summer hotel marketing into high gear now. Whether you have a large outdoor courtyard or a small rooftop patio, your outdoor spaces can become sought-after venues for groups looking to enjoy the warm weather. Here's how to make your outdoor spaces the go-to destination for summer events:
 
Market Your Outdoor Spaces
 
Effective marketing is the first step to garnering interest in your outdoor venues. Here’s how to showcase your spaces and attract event planners:
 
Highlight Past Events: Use photos and testimonials from previous successful events to demonstrate your venue’s potential. High-quality images of well-decorated spaces, happy guests, and beautifully presented food and beverages can be very persuasive.
 
Showcase Outdoor Activities and Experiences: Share captivating photographs and alluring descriptions that transport potential guests to the heart of these outdoor experiences. Paint a vivid picture of the opportunities that having an outdoor event can offer such as barbecues, picnics, or al fresco dining. Show summer-friendly activities for corporate or social events, such as a yoga class or a fun scavenger hunt on your property. Highlight a pet-friendly vibe to show your amenities for four-legged guests.
 
Stage Photoshoots: If you’re just starting out or want to refresh your marketing materials, consider staging photoshoots. Include lots of colors, festive beverages, and delectable food items. Show different setups to illustrate the versatility of your space.
 
Social Media for Summer Hotel Marketing: Leverage social media platforms to share visuals and stories about your outdoor spaces. Create engaging posts, reels, and stories that capture the essence of summer events at your venue. Short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram Reels are perfect to show a glimpse of what you offer this summer.
 
Include Summer Vibes for All Groups: Captivate potential clients by showcasing the summer event packages and offers that make your property truly shine. Unleash your creativity and craft experiences that transport your guests into the heart of a summer vacation, regardless of the event type. For corporate clients, craft packages that seamlessly blend productive meetings with rejuvenating outdoor activities, fostering team bonding and inspiration under the summer sun. Social event clients, too, will revel in the summertime spirit you weave. Tantalize them with visions of outdoor ceremonies adorned with vibrant blooms, followed by dazzling receptions where the stars twinkle overhead.

Offer Unique Summer Offerings to Stand Out
 
To differentiate your property from others, incorporate unique and fun elements into your outdoor space:
 
Creative Seating Options: Replace traditional seating with swings or hammocks to add a playful and relaxed vibe. This unique touch can make your venue more memorable.
 
Specialty Bars: Introduce themed bar carts like an oyster and champagne bar or a DIY cocktail station. These unique experiential offerings can become the highlight of the event and attract more bookings.
 
Interactive Activities: Provide lawn games such as cornhole, giant Jenga, or croquet. These activities encourage guest interaction and can be a major selling point for event planners looking for a fun and engaging environment.

Customize Your Events
 
Customization and personalization can make events at your property feel exclusive and special. Consider the following options:
 
Signature Cocktails and Dishes for the Season: Create and offer unique cocktails or dishes that are exclusive to your outdoor space and the summer season. Even if they are available indoors, marketing them as special offerings for outdoor events can make them seem extra appealing. Make sure water is ready and visibly placed at multiple spots in your property and within your event spaces.
 
Themed Decor Packages: Offer customizable decor packages that align with different themes, such as tropical, bohemian, or garden party. This allows planners to personalize the space according to their vision.
 
Flexible Layouts: Be prepared to customize the layout to suit different event types, from corporate gatherings to intimate weddings. Flexible options make your venue more attractive to a broader range of clients.
 
Overnight Rooms Packages: Your group may need or want some overnight rooms for guests attending their event, so when possible, curate packages or negotiate room rates for those attending. A good deal on a room, whether it’s price or extra amenities included, may even entice extra guests to stay who otherwise wouldn’t!
 
Implement Efficient Event Management
 
Alongside summer hotel marketing initiatives, ensuring smooth and efficient group and event management is crucial. Reduce pressure on your workforce. Utilize a comprehensive event management system like Tripleseat for Hotels. This platform can help you manage every detail, from initial inquiries and menu planning to room blocks and final billing. Efficient management not only enhances the client experience but also helps maintain a high standard of service.
 
Hosting the best summer events at your property involves a blend of creative marketing, unique offerings, and efficient management. By highlighting the versatility and uniqueness of your outdoor spaces, offering fun and interactive elements, and ensuring seamless event execution, you can attract more group business and make your venue the top choice for summer gatherings.
