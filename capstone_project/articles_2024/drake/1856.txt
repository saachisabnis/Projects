Washington Commanders at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5, 49), 8:15 p.m. ET Thursday (Amazon Prime Video)
This TNF showdown between the 7-3 Commanders and 7-2 Eagles is for the NFC East lead, and Philly is hoping to extend its recent series dominance after winning 11 of the last 14 meetings.
Baltimore Ravens (-3, 48.5) at Pittsburgh Steelers, 1 p.m. Sunday
It’s an AFC North showdown here between Pittsburgh (7-2) and Baltimore (7-3), and the Steelers have won seven of the last eight meetings (6-2 against the spread) — all one-score games.
Las Vegas Raiders at Miami Dolphins (-7.5, 44), 1 p.m. Sunday
Miami (3-6) escaped the league’s Two-Win Club with Monday night’s 23-15 victory over the host Los Angeles Rams, but Las Vegas (2-7) remains after dropping its last five contests.
Green Bay Packers (-6, 40.5) at Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. Sunday
The struggling Bears (4-5) have fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron after totaling only four field goals over their last two games, and now comes a date against the rival Packers (6-3) who have won 10 straight in the series, going 10-0 ATS as well.
Jacksonville Jaguars at Detroit Lions (-13, 47), 1 p.m. Sunday
It’s a rare double-digit spread this season as the NFC-leading Lions (8-1) host the Jaguars (2-8), who likely will be without injured starting QB Trevor Lawrence for the second straight game.
Cleveland Browns at New Orleans Saints (-1.5, 44.5), 1 p.m. Sunday
QB James Winston returns to the Big Easy with the Browns (2-7) to face the Saints (3-7), who snapped a seven-game skid with last Sunday’s 20-17 win over the visiting Atlanta Falcons.
Indianapolis Colts at New York Jets (-4, 44), 1 p.m. Sunday
These are two AFC foes trending in the wrong direction with the Colts (4-6) having lost three straight while Aaron Rodgers and the Jets (3-7) have dropped six of their last seven.
Minnesota Vikings (-6, 39.5) at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. Sunday
The Vikings (7-2) are a big road favorites against the Titans (2-7), who own the league’s second-worst turnover (-11) and point (-83) differentials.
Los Angeles Rams (-5, 44) at New England Patriots, 1 p.m. Sunday
Matthew Stafford and the Rams (4-5) are smarting after failing to find the end zone in Monday night’s 23-15 home loss to the Dolphins, but rookie QB Drake Maye and the Pats (3-7) won’t be an easy mark with two wins in their last three outings.
Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers (-6.5, 49.5), 4:05 p.m. Sunday
The Niners (5-4) will be looking for their seventh straight win over the Seahawks (4-5) after notching a 36-23 Week 6 Thursday night victory in the Pacific Northwest.
Atlanta Falcons at Denver Broncos (-2, 44), 4:05 p.m. Sunday
This inter-conference matchup in the Mile High City suddenly has more importance with the Falcons (6-4) and Broncos (5-5) both coming off disappointing road losses in Week 10.
Kansas City Chiefs at Buffalo Bills (-2, 45.5), 4:25 p.m. Sunday
Patrick Mahomes and the undefeated Chiefs (9-0) have eliminated Josh Allen’s Bills (8-2) in the playoffs in three of the last four seasons, but oddly Buffalo has won regular season meetings in each of the last three years.
Cincinnati Bengals at Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5, 47), 8:20 p.m. Sunday (NBC, Peacock)
Joe Burrow and the high-powered 4-6 Bengals (27 points per game) visit Jim Harbaugh’s defensive-minded Chargers (6-3), who are limiting foes to a league-low 13.1 points per contest.
Houston Texans (-7.5, 42) at Dallas Cowboys, 8:15 p.m. Monday (ABC, ESPN)
This Texas tussle looked much better on paper this summer, but on Monday night, QB Cooper Rush and the Cowboys (3-6) will be looking for their first home win of the season against C.J. Stroud and the AFC South-leading Texans (6-4).
