The IRS just made a huge announcement that could mean extra cash in your pocket! Around one million taxpayers will automatically receive payments of up to $1,400 in the coming weeks, thanks to the Recovery Rebate Credit they may have missed on their 2021 tax returns.
The IRS says these payments are headed to taxpayers who either left the rebate credit section blank or filled it out incorrectly when they qualified for it. No paperwork, no headaches—this one’s on autopilot according to IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel: 
“We’re committed to making things right for taxpayers.” 
Checks and direct deposits started rolling out this month, and everyone eligible will have their cash by January. 
If you filed a 2023 tax return, expect the money to land in your listed bank account. No active account? A check will be sent to your address on file.
Americans received three stimulus payments during the pandemic—$1,200, $600, and $1,400. Missed the full amount? That’s what the Recovery Rebate Credit was for, but many people didn’t claim it.
With $2.4 billion on the way, the IRS is making sure eligible taxpayers get what’s owed to them. Keep an eye on your mailbox or bank account—you may be $1,400 richer!
