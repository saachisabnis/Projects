Will Lamar Jackson have a big day on the ground? Can Nico Collins get over his reception total? Read on for our Ravens vs. Texans Same Game Parlay.
This is a big number but the Texans have been relatively gouged on the ground by opposing quarterbacks this season. They just surrendered 33 yards and a rushing touchdown to Patrick Mahomes, who was playing on an injured ankle. The Texans also allowed 56 and 45 yards to Anthony Richardson of the Colts, 44 yards rushing to Caleb Williams, 54 yards to Josh Allen and 38 yards to rookie Drake Maye.
With Will Anderson (hand) and Jimmie Ward (foot) also dealing with injuries, Houston could struggle to contain Jackson this afternoon.
I faded Mixon last week when the Texans faced the Chiefs and I’ll do so again here today. According to Sharp Football, the Ravens have allowed a league-low 3.5 yards per carry to running backs, with a 65.7% success rate against those runs (5th). They have also allowed a first down or a touchdown on 16.6% of backfield runs, which is the lowest rate in the league.
Even with Tank Dell out for the season, the Texans’ best path for success today against the Ravens is through the air. This is a big number for a reception total but who else is C.J. Stroud going to throw to today? Collins collected seven out of 10 targets for 60 yards. He was targeted on 30.2% of his routes with 3.32 yards per route run.		



 




The Ravens allowed eight receptions to George Pickens (Steelers), six to Ladd McConkey (Chargers) and 10 to Malik Nabers (Giants). Thus, they have a habit of allowing big time production to opposing top targets.
