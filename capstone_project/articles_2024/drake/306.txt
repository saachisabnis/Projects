If you are on Grand Valley State University's Allendale campus on Mondays and Tuesdays, you may see a new staple to the GVSU community!
A mobile barbershop!
How did this come to be?
Longtime barber and owner of Grand Rapids' The Executive Cut, Cecil "CJ" Jackson (CJ The Barber Artist) has started an amazing initiative for GVSU students.
With over 17 years of experience and clients like Devon Booker, Kavon Frazier, and Drake Harris, Cecil knows what he is doing!
With his mobile barbershop, students are able to sign up for a free haircut!
How is this happening?
Thankfully, Cecil has collaborated with several campus departments to make this happen.
Cecil shared that he is able to do around 100 haircuts a month with this new initiative!
Plus, his work is incredible! So, these young people are getting the glow-up that they want!
It makes complete sense why Cecil goes by CJ The Barber Artist cause he is truly making art with every single haircut.
Cecil spoke with WoodTV about how this has been a plan that he wanted to implement for years. Once he got his bus, he wanted to go to the college "because I know kids are coming from different cities, different states."
Based on Facebook and Instagram posts, this mobile barbershop seems to have officially started on December 4th.
On December 4th, CJ The Barber Artist was giving out 'Cuts at the Clock." From 10am until 5pm, Cecil was giving out free haircuts, thanks to generous donors.
With summer break coming, I am hopeful that Cecil will be getting A LOT of college clients over the next few weeks.
However, if you are not a college student, you can still get blessed by Cecil's art by booking an appointment with him.
