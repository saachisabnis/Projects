Mustard is capitalizing on his success from producing Kendrick Lamar‘s “Not Like Us” with plans for a new album.
As the chart-topping Drake diss (which gave the producer his first-ever No. 1) continues to play on the radio and in clubs, the West Coast native took to Instagram on Wednesday (June 5) to announce his fourth studio album in celebration of his birthday.

“FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED SUMMER 2024,” he wrote with a teaser clip. “A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU. LOVE Y’ALL. SEE YOU SOON.”
The clip is set over a sermon that references the album title, encapsulating the overall theme of faith and perseverance. Throughout the video, a montage showcases the 34-year-old with his children, going through his fitness journey, studio sessions, early days in his career and more.
Faith Of A Mustard Seed follows 2019’s Perfect 10, which featured the hits “Pure Water” with Migos and “Ballin” with Roddy Ricch.
Outside of music, Mustard just announced he’s expecting a child with his new girlfriend, Brittany Stroud.
