Two infants born in May in Iowa are now in the state’s custody through the Safe Haven Law, the state reported this week.
A baby girl born May 15 and a baby boy born May 26 are in the care and custody of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and will be placed with a foster family until a permanent placement is determined, the state said.
More than 70 infants have been taken in by the state and placed in permanent homes since the Iowa’s Safe Haven Law went into effect more than two decades ago, according to the Health and Human Services Department.
The law provides an option for parents in crisis who determine they cannot care for an infant up to 90 days old to surrender the child at designated locations like hospitals and fire stations.
There have been three uses of the Safe Haven Law this year; there were 10 infants relinquished to the state in 2023, according to the department.
The avian influenza has been detected in two dairy herds in Northwest Iowa, agricultural officials announced.
One herd each were infected in Plymouth and Sioux counties.
The latest bird flu outbreak has now infected five dairy cattle herds in Iowa, according to tracking information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Animal food products — like poultry, eggs and pasteurized milk — remain safe to eat and drink, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. Meat products from infected cattle herds also are safe, provided they are properly cooked, officials say.
Northwestern Iowa’s Monona and Woodbury counties have been added to disaster declarations from Gov. Kim Reynolds in response to severe weather on June 12 and June 13, Reynolds’ office announced.
The proclamation allows residents in the two counties to access state resources for response and recovery efforts.

The division revoked Flaherty’s license in March 2023.
Flaherty was ordered to pay more than $44,500 in restitution, which the division distributed to two Iowa consumers impacted by Flaherty’s misconduct, according to the division.
