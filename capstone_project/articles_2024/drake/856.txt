One of the most beautiful places I have hiked in recent days was the Effigy Mounds National Monument in Harpers Ferry Iowa. A beautiful area along the driftless region of the mighty Mississippi River. It has historical significance, Native American burial mounds, and a museum all on site. I have also visited a mound site close to home in Dubuque. But what if I told you there was another, just as impressive location, on the other side of Iowa that has largely been forgotten by our residents since its location was purchased by Iowa in 1987. This location is also considered Iowa's largest historical landmark.
Nestled along the Big Sioux River on the border of Iowa and South Dakota lies Blood Run, an ancient Oneota village that has witnessed centuries of change, trade, and rich cultural expression. While Effigy Mounds National Monument in Harpers Ferry draws visitors from around the country to explore its sacred earthworks and learn about Native American history, Blood Run remains less well-known, often overshadowed despite its archaeological significance, size, and potential as an educational and cultural site. With recent excavations bringing new understanding to the area, it’s time to consider what could be done to preserve and honor Blood Run in Iowa as it has with the Effigy Mounds and as South Dakota has done with it's portion of Blood Run itself.
Blood Run was once a bustling center for the Oneota people, a Native American culture that once thrived from around 900 A.D. to 1720 A.D. Archaeological evidence paints a picture of a vibrant community, connected to extensive trade routes and engaged in farming, hunting, crafting, and ceremonial activities. Excavations have uncovered pottery, chipped stone tools, and other everyday objects, along with traces of trade items, such as beads and metal fragments that hint at indirect contact with Europeans.
The site also has significant earthworks, including mounds and an intricate serpent-shaped effigy. Some mounds served as burial sites, while others likely had ceremonial or protective purposes. These features are similar to those at Effigy Mounds, where the mounds, in the shapes of animals (bears, hawks, and reptiles), serve both as a cultural emblem and as spiritual sites for the tribes connected to the land. It is important to note, the Effigy Mounds National Monument site had its own issues during early days of construction, so it would be best not to follow in those same pitfalls, should Iowa look to preserve Blood Run in a similar way.
Why Should Blood Run Matter to Iowa?
Beyond its archaeological treasures, Blood Run offers an incredible opportunity to tell the story of a thriving Indigenous culture that eventually faced upheaval due to European influence. By the early 1700s, increased European trade, along with disease and conflict from neighboring tribes acquiring horses and guns, led the Oneota to abandon Blood Run, leaving a "snapshot" of pre-colonial life in the region. This "frozen-in-time" record reveals much about Native American trade, lifestyle, social organization, and resilience in the face of changing environmental and cultural landscapes. It's Iowa history, so it should matter based on that alone.
Effigy Mounds National Monument offers a prime example of how a culturally significant site can be preserved, protected, and shared in a way that engages the public while still respecting Indigenous heritage. Blood Run could benefit greatly from similar preservation efforts and a structured, sustainable approach to making it available to regular visitors.
I will be the first to admit that things were not always done right in regard to the Native tribes during the creation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. Some of those issues included the creation of over 3 million dollars in illegal boardwalks, trails, and buildings, what essentially boils down to "grave robbing," and the mishandling of remains and funerary objects that needed to be given back for repatriation and reburial. Currently at Effigy Mounds, the National Park Service has established a range of initiatives that have made the site both a tourist attraction and an educational resource, and these strategies could serve as a blueprint for Blood Run as well.
To be fair they're trying to, but there are several challenges and considerations to take into account for this specific historical site. First off, it would require approximately 2340 acres in Iowa and approximately 1000 acres in South Dakota to preserve the complete Blood Run site. Blood Run sits on both public and private land, and this complicates its preservation efforts. Partnering with private landowners, state agencies, and local governments would be essential to create a cohesive strategy for managing and protecting the site as well as expanding it. Current farmers don't want to give up their land and livelihoods, and no one can blame them for that.
Funding is always a major consideration, as transforming Blood Run would require significant resources. Grant applications, fundraising efforts, and public support continue to be extremely necessary to establish a visitor center, interpretive trails, and preservation programs. Effigy Mounds, as part of the National Park Service, benefits from federal funding, but Blood Run would likely need additional state and local financial support or private contributions to make these visions a reality, unless it could be granted the same federal historical significance as the Effigy Mounds.
Finally, and most importantly in the case of Blood Run, sensitivity to Indigenous perspectives must remain at the forefront of any development plans. While increasing public access is important, it’s equally crucial to balance this with respect for the sacredness of the site. Blood Run isn’t just an archaeological location; it’s part of a broader Indigenous cultural landscape. Local tribes assert its spiritual significance, and in that regard, efforts would need to be made to prioritize maintaining the dignity and integrity of that heritage. As mentioned above, local tribe leaders have been a part of the ongoing process at Blood Run.
I'll be honest, I love exploring and will most likely make a trip to this location in its current state to enjoy the natural beauty and historical significance for myself. However, if Iowa takes steps to protect and share Blood Run even further with the public, it could become an even more invaluable cultural site that helps us understand the history of Iowa's native tribes. Like Effigy Mounds, Blood Run has the potential to serve as an educational space where visitors can engage with the past, understand the complexity of Indigenous life, and appreciate the resilience of the Oneota and their descendants.
Envisioning a visitor and research center, interpretive trails, guided tours, and cultural events, one can imagine Blood Run as a place where people come not only to learn about history, but celebrate it. With the support of local communities, Indigenous tribes, and the state, Blood Run could truly transform into a space that preserves Iowa’s Indigenous heritage for generations to come. The path forward requires careful planning (currently underway), partnerships, dedication, and most importantly funding (several key grants have been accessed over the years), but it’s definitely one worth pursuing to honor Iowa's history and cultural significance for who came before.
