NFL rookies welcomed to the league in incredible video from Fanatics
The annual NFL Hall of Fame Game is Thursday night between the Chicago Bears and the Houston Texans, marking the official start of the preseason slate.
However, NFL teams have been at work for weeks now, preparing for the 2024 season. For rookies, that work includes getting acclimated to a new city, sometimes is city — or even a coast — they have never visited before.
To that point, Fanatics stepped in to help. The company put together a video of various fans, celebrities, and family members welcoming rookies to their new teams. And it is well worth your time:
We couldn't think of a better way to introduce these young stars to their new cities. Welcome home, 2024 @NFL Rookies. pic.twitter.com/7HuiUfv6aN
