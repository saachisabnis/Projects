The line for quarterbacks taken in the first round of the NFL Draft was 4.5, albeit at significant juice.
Who would have thought, though, that that the over would hit within the first 10 picks. Exactly half of the top 10 selections were quarterbacks, but the biggest surprise revolved around Michael Penix Jr.
J.J. McCarthy was expected to be the fourth quarterback taken after Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye. Instead, it was the Washington star in Penix — who brought the Huskies within one win of a national championship — who was fourth off the board.
Penix going before McCarthy — who eventually went two picks later to the Minnesota Vikings — was certainly eye-opening. However, the biggest shock perhaps was that it was the Atlanta Falcons who took him with the No. 8 overall pick. Penix was a 66-1 longshot to be taken at that slot.
The selection was particularly out of the blue considering the Falcons opened up their wallet for Kirk Cousins in the offseason.  They signed the veteran to a four-year, $180 million deal with $100 million guaranteed. The team’s official website reported that Cousins will receive $90 million in 2024-25, plus another $10 million in 2026.
Add it all up and Penix going eighth overall to Atlanta ranks as a true draft-day shocker, and a profitable one for those who rolled the dice on this unlikely scenario playing out.
