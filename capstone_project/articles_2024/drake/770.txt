From her childhood, Bridget McCutchen always had a sense of discovery, even though she never ventured far from the family farm where she was homeschooled near Ashland. But last fall she went where few men — or women — had gone before to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe on a motorcycle, pending final certification by the Guinness Book of World Records. She shares her story with “Simply Superior” host Robin Washington.
Also: Nolen Sellwood grew up and went to school in the Twin Cities suburbs, where he began learning guitar from his high school art teacher. He also discovered the work of Nick Drake, an English folk artist who sadly only lived to age 26 when he died in 1974 — a generation before Sellwood was born. Sellwood, now a student at the University of Minnesota Duluth, shares his unique style in advance of his April 5 performance at Duluth’s Sacred Heart Music Center.
