In this episode of “The Real Forno Show,” Tyler Forness gets ready to prepare us for the Minnesota Vikings’ 2024 season opener against the New York Giants in week 1, he delves into the potential impact of undrafted free agents, Mike Zimmer’s candid comments, and college football insights. #SKOL!
As the Minnesota Vikings prepare for their first game of the season in just five days, there’s plenty to discuss. How will the undrafted free agents (UDFAs) contribute to the team? What’s the buzz around Mike Zimmer’s tenure with the Vikings, and how will early college football scouting influence the Vikings’ draft strategy? In this latest episode of The Real Forno Show, hosted by Tyler Forness and produced by Dave Stefano, we dive deep into these fascinating topics and more.
One of the hot topics in this episode is former Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer. Tyler sets the scene, referencing a recent in-depth article by Mark Craig in the Star Tribune. “The Mike Zimmer stuff was interesting, Dave, and I’ll be honest, I haven’t had a chance to watch Two Old Bloggers because I spent the weekend focused on a lot of my writing,” Tyler says.
Dave shares his perspective on Craig’s article, noting some potentially biased elements: “It sort of seems like a hit piece...but behind the motivations and how he got Zimmer to talk, whether Zimmer did it willingly, which could be, but it did seem like Mike is still very angry and bitter and is having a hard time moving on or refuses to.”
Tyler elaborates on the complexities: “There are always three sides: Your side, my side, and the truth. Because as much as you try to be 100 percent honest and truthful, there’s always going to be an inherent bias.” This balanced perspective underscores the need to consider various angles when discussing Zimmer’s tenure.
Tyler also mentions some of the personal and professional struggles Zimmer has faced, including the tragic passing of his son Adam. Surprisingly, one of Zimmer’s coping mechanisms was an unconventional yet heartwarming activity: “He went and bought an excavator and dug a six-acre lake.” Tyler adds, “That rules so much that he just messed around and dug his own lake. How cool is that?”
Shifting gears, the conversation turns to the UDFAs and their potential impact on the Vikings’ season. In 2023, the Vikings’ UDFA class includes Jalen Redman, Taki Taimani, and Dwight McGlothern. “These guys might end up playing a major role in 2024,” Tyler points out, highlighting their potential.
Tyler praises the strategic planning behind these acquisitions: “Levi Drake Rodriguez might be the first guy off the bench because he’s versatile. Taki Taimani, if he’s going to be used situationally, might not dress for every game.”
The discussion then moves to how these young players could accelerate their development by getting significant playing time. “Even if only one of these guys hits, guess what? You’re going to have a rookie contract with one of them, and you’re going to pay them peanuts to be a quality rotational piece,” Tyler explains.
Dave agrees, emphasizing the adaptability of the coaching strategy: “I think B-Flo’s going to use them to the best of their skills. Whether it be pushing up the middle, run-blocking, tackling...he’s going to try to pick situations that optimize their talents.”
Next, the discussion shifts to early college football scouting, with Tyler and Dave examining standout players like Travis Hunter and wide receivers who could be game-changers for the Vikings. Tyler reflects on Travis Hunter’s unique skills but offers a word of caution: “Anybody who tells you that Travis Hunter is going to play both ways on a full-time basis, I don’t think is telling you the truth.”
He elaborates on the challenge of playing both ways at an elite level: “Champ Bailey was a two-way player, Charles Woodson was a two-way player, Chris Gamble was a two-way player. Now the first two are in the Hall of Fame. Anyone attempting this will need to be a historic outlier.”
Tyler’s excitement peaks when talking about Luther Burden from Missouri and Tetairoa McMillan from Arizona, who he believes could be future stars. He enthuses, “Imagine giving Deandre Hopkins more speed and three inches of height ‘cause that’s kind of what you’re working with.” Dave and Tyler then discuss the importance of drafting based on talent rather than immediate needs. “The draft should not be to address needs, it should be to address talent,” Tyler asserts.
McMillan, who showcased his abilities with 10 catches for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns in a game, is someone Tyler is particularly excited about. He compares McMillan to NFL stalwarts: “Think of Vincent Jackson; McMillan has that kind of size and versatility.”
As the episode wraps up, anticipation for week one against the New York Giants is strong. Dave stresses the need to focus on the upcoming game: “We want to talk about the team going in to defeat the New York Giants. Not this BS.”
Tyler promises more insights into the upcoming game, saying, “We will be back on Wednesday with more as the Vikings prepare to play their first game of the 2024 season against the Giants.”
