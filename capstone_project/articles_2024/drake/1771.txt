Drake is throwing more support to his fellow Canadian Tory Lanez as he serves out his 10-year sentence in the Megan Thee Stallion case ... but Champagne Papi wants him out ASAP!!!
Following the Cleveland show of his, "It's All a Blur - Big As the What?" tour, Drake tossed up a black-and-white photo of Tory and captioned the flick "3 you" ... as in free the "Alone At Prom" singer from his current predicament.
Tory was found guilty of shooting MTS last August and promptly sentenced to 10 years ... and was eventually denied bond.
Megan's lawyer told us Drake and other doubters would eat crow ahead of the verdict but Drake's going Team Canada all the way.
Despite Drake's wishes, it appears Tory will be staying put for the time being ... a scenario Tory says he's since made peace with.
Fans are pissed at Drake for still standing by Tory and this isn't the first time he rubbed them the wrong way.
Drake sent a slick shot to Megan about her lying about being shot by Tory on his Grammy-nominated "Her Loss" album ... and his new call for freedom says the Hotties won't be getting an apology anytime soon.
