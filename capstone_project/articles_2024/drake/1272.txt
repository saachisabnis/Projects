I have not had much of a chance to give a review of the Vikings draft. I like the trades although I think they could have stayed put and got McCarthy anyway. Sean “douchebag” Payton claims he faked out the Vikings but that is hard to believe. How would the Vikings know the Broncos are on the phone with the Jets? Of course they could made a reasonable guess. Maybe he was on the phone without ever intending to trade up and the Jets told the Vikings that they had another team on the line? I am sure it happens all the time.
We could lament the fact that they did not have those picks but who knows if fourth round or later players will ever make a big contribution.
I love trades so I am not mad about mid to late round picks being given up to get who you want.
The Turner trade is the one to watch IMHO. If the Vikings do not make that trade they probably could have taken Chop Robinson instead and kept their 2025 3rd and 4th round picks.
Since the team is set to have plenty of cap space next year, they can take care of things in free agency.
After Khyree Jackson it is really not worth criticizing.
