Drizzy also released another three new songs that he previously leaked on his burner Instagram.

Drake has had tons of his music hit the internet thanks to leakers over the years, and he decided to turn the gun around and intentionally leak 100 Gigs of content from various eras of his career earlier in Aug. 

	Drizzy unloaded the vault with stacks of folders that included three new songs featuring 21 Savage, Young Thug and Latto along with photos, videos and lost album cover arts to go along with studio session clips. 

	 It all started with fans noticing Drake following an IG account titled Plottttwistttttt, which led to speculation about new music on the way. 

	Once the account was taken off private, the floodgates opened leading fans to the 100GIGSFORYOURHEADTOP website. The OVO boss also reposted the IG account’s music clips to his Instagram Story.

	Drake has been careful with his music choices in wake of the Kendrick Lamar feud. He’s notched collaborations with Sexyy Red, Camila Cabello and Gordo in the months since, but hasn’t released any songs in an official capacity, and now has employed a purposeful leak strategy.

	Plenty of clips have gone viral in the hours since the leak’s arrival, including him recording the reference track to what became Kanye West’s “Yikes” from his 2018 Ye album. He also detailed how a romantic partner inspired him to craft “Hotline Bling” in 2015.

	Drake returned with a second 100 Gigs dump on Sunday (Aug. 25) along with three new tracks. This time around featured clips from the Nothing Was The Same era and had cameos from Ye, The Weeknd, Mustard and more.

	After sifting through more of the 100 Gigs of OVO content, here are the 15 best moments from the compilation footage.

	Steph Curry pulled up to Drake’s mansion and the two competed in a heated game of ping pong, but it’s unclear who ultimately got the best of the match-up. The NBA star then took his talents to the outdoor basketball court, where he proceeded to cook all of the 6 God’s friends and affiliates. This appears to be during the mid-2010s as Drizzy was working on Views.

	Pusha T beat Drake to the punch when exposing that the 6 God had a son named Adonis on his scathing “The Story of Adidon” diss track in 2018. Shortly after, Drake decided to continue executing his plan to reveal his child to the world on Scorpion‘s “March 14.” Footage from the 100 Gigs drop shows Drake eagerly listening to every detail of the track off an iPhone.

	Drake had one of those “my life’s a movie” type of moments seeing his hard work pay off when walking inside his luxurious Air Drake private jet for the first time. He also gave fans a look at his design process for the Air Drake 2 sister plane while listening to Yeat. “Chances Are She’s On Board” is a fitting tagline for the OVO aviation.

	The Rihanna-Drake relationship is severed these days with her baby daddy A$AP Rocky and Drizzy even exchanging shots on diss tracks. But that wasn’t always the case, as Drake and Rih were close collaborators and more in the first half of the 2010s. A 100 Gigs clip found Drake and Rihanna at soundcheck rehearsing their 2011 “Take Care” collaboration in front of an empty arena. Even back then, the chemistry was apparent.

	A hook-up inspired one of Drake’s diamond-certified anthems. Drizzy explained how a girl’s phone kept going off when they were hanging out together, which led to him storing her in his phone as “Hotline Bling.” 

	“We used to be in bed together … and her phone would be blowing up. So I saved her name in my phone as ‘Hotline Bling.’ That’s always been her name on my phone,” he said. “And I was looking at it today, I was like, ‘Hotline Bling’ is a sick name. That should be an artist name.”

	He eventually put the energy into recording a record with her contact name as the title and the rest is history. Interestingly enough, Drake nearly had Future hop on “Hotline Bling” with him. “When I was writing it, I wrote it as a Shy Glizzy song,” he said. “That’s why I was asking if we should put Future on this s–t.”

	Drake’s 2018 Wyoming trip proved to be a pivotal point in the fracturing of his relationship with Kanye. At the time, Hot 97’s Peter Rosenberg reported that Drake flew to Wyoming to work with West and was initially left off as a co-writer on “Yikes” when the track arrived as part of Yeezy’s Ye album. 

	Now we have the footage of Drake working on what became the hook to “Yikes” as he recorded the reference. A line can be drawn from the Drake and Kanye relationship souring to the Pusha T and Drizzy feud boiling over a couple of months later in May 2018.

	Drake took it back to the Take Care era when he built a make-shift studio in a hotel room closet to record poignant project opener “Over My Dead Body.” Footage shows him instructing Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk how he wants her to open the record with an intoxicating introduction.

	When Jay-Z agrees to hop on a record, you move mountains to make that happen. Drake was clearly up against the clock when game planning with OVO 40 to be ready for Jay to send his verse through for what became “Talk Up” on 2021’s Certified Lover Boy.

	Hov’s engineer, Young Guru, provided some context on the situation, which saw them thread the needle from a time perspective with Jay performing in Europe with Beyoncé for the OTR2 Tour and having to record his verse immediately after a show.

	“Furthest Thing” has long been a fan-favorite for the OVO faithful from his acclaimed 2013 album Nothing Was The Same. The platinum track peaked at No. 56 on the Hot 100. 100 Gigs gives fans an improbable look at Drizzy laying down his vocals. “I just want to come hear it and see if it makes sense. I think I want the drums to drop too,” he said while captaining the ship in the studio.

	Drake served up the ultimate co-sign for the Atlanta trio ahead of the mainstream explosion that was on the horizon for Migos. Drizzy hopped on the remix to their slippery “Versace” anthem and nothing was the same for the ATLiens, who earned their first Hot 100 entry in part thanks to Drake as they snuck in at No. 99. 

	Another clip found Drake rehearsing for tour and joking about how he wanted the Migos ad-libs to be implemented as sound effects while he was on stage during his set. Quavo saluted Drake after getting wind of the video on his IG Story. “@champagnepapi Never forget what we did gang!!! Migo gang 4L Drake Sinatra,” Huncho wrote.

	After joining one of his idols on stage at OVO Fest in 2013, Drake took a minute to process the bucket list moment while backstage with his team. “I’m the biggest Ye fan, period. Sometimes I feel like I can’t like it because I gotta go against it,” Drake admitted. “But that s–t tonight was almost therapeutic.”

	Colliding with a heavyweight like Hov can be an intimidating task for any rapper and Drake knew he had to bring his A-game to Nothing Was The Same‘s “Pound Cake.” 100 Gigs footage shows Drizzy laboring over how to perfect his opening verse. “It might just need an ad-lib,” he said. “Cus I listen to that verse and I’m used to it. I like that tone. I sound like a man on there next to Hov.”

	Drake and Ye have enjoyed a competitive relationship over the years while jumping between friends and foes depending on the day. West popped out at Drizzy’s OVO Fest in 2013 where he gave the 6 God his flowers in his hometown.

	“Me and Hov wouldn’t have made Watch the Throne if this n—a wasn’t putting pressure on us like that,” he said before performing “Can’t Tell Me Nothing.” “So I just want to pay my respect.”

	Drake is on icy terms with YG and Mustard these days, but that wasn’t always the case. He revealed a phone conversation with the West Coast duo ahead of hopping on YG’s “Who Do You Love?” single in 2014. The track reached No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

	The move to include the clip comes after Mustard referred to Drake as a “strange guy” in an interview with The Los Angeles Times published Aug. 21. “I don’t think I want to make a song with that dude,” he told the paper. “He’s a strange guy.”

	Drake accompanied J. Cole on a trip to Best Buy with his team including manager Ibrahim Hamad to purchase every CD copy of Cole’s Born Sinner album that the store had in stock when the project was released in June 2013. BS debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 297,000 total album units sold, which was about 30,000 shy of Ye’s Yeezus LP.
