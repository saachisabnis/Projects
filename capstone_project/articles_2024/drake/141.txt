The Game has inserted himself into the ongoing rap wars by taking aim at Rick Ross on his fiery new diss track “Freeway’s Revenge.”
Though the two have worked together in the past, most notably on “Ali Bomaye” from The Game’s Jesus Piece album, the Compton native appears to have an issue with Rozay’s relentless trolling of Drake in his feud with Kendrick Lamar and co.

Released on Friday (May 10), “Freeway’s Revenge” finds The Game throwing some flagrant shots at the MMG mogul regarding his alleged sexual kinks, weight and health issues, and past stint as a correctional officer.
“You 12 lemon pepper wings from a heart attack/ Akademiks, give this n-gga an Ozempic starter pack,” he raps, before referencing the aforementioned Drizzy-K. Dot beef: “This ain’t the Kendrick beef, my Drac’ [Drake] sings songs/ Shots rings out, the neighbor better have his Ring on.”

The Game later accuses Ross of enjoying golden showers and claims former MMG rapper Gunplay knows where the proverbial bodies are buried: “Your baby mama told me that you liked to get peed on/ You a C.O., that’s the last time you had keys on/ And we know you treat Gunplay like he a peon/ And he knows some shit that ain’t cool for him to speak on.”
After a beat switch, the “Hate It or Love It” hitmaker dedicates much of the second half of the song to dismantling Rozay’s “Bigges Bawse” persona.
“I don’t want to hear about no fish tanks and marble floors/ No spiral steps, no swimming pools, no hors d’oeuvres, no Audemars/ No car shows, no pinky rings, no umbrellas in the car doors/ Introduce me and my connect to that Columbian you chopped that raw for,” he raps.
“Was it fabricated? The lies you tell are getting saturated/ What happened to the birds in the Maserati? They just evaporated?/ Bawse — that shit be too exaggerated/ Fucking with a Compton n-gga, get your head decapitated […] The stories these n-ggas tell/ He gon’ tell us he got a key for every n-gga he locked in a cell.”

He also spits: “He gon’ tell us he just bought another crib, he living well/ But he won’t tell us about his health condition, he sick as hell/ He popping pills, they starting to fuck with his brain/ Seizures off the lean, Balenciaga shorts got shit stains.”
Even the song title itself is a jab, referring to “Freeway” Ricky Ross, the drug lord who (unsuccessfully) sued the Florida rapper over claims he stole his stage name from him.

Further ridiculing his former collaborator, The Game also uploaded an AI image to his Instagram Stories of Ross wearing a tight-fitting police uniform and running away from a KFC restaurant holding a bucket of fried chicken.
Rozay has yet to reply to The Game.
The Game had previously called out Rick Ross for taking shots at Drake, albeit in more subliminal fashion.
“It’s quiet today Wingstop must be closed on Monday’s [sic],” he wrote on his Instagram Stories earlier this week, subtly referencing the restaurant chain that has several locations owned by the MMG mogul.

In a follow-up Story, The Game appeared to taunt Ross over his weight, writing: “It be the fat n-ggas with the skinny legs always running they mouth.”
Rozay has frequently mocked Drizzy on social media in his beef with Kendrick Lamar, Future and Metro Boomin et al., and even released a diss track of his own aimed at the Canadian called “Champagne Moments.”
