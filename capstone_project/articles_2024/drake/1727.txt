For months, Republican Nikki Haley has longed to be in a two-person race with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Now, she's trying to will it into existence.
A day after finishing third in the Iowa caucuses, Haley issued an ultimatum, saying she would not take part in another presidential debate unless she can take on Trump directly.
"We've had five great debates in this campaign," Haley said in a Jan. 16 statement. "Unfortunately, Donald Trump has ducked all of them. He has nowhere left to hide. The next debate I do will either be with Donald Trump or with Joe Biden. I look forward to it."
Haley's blunt announcement comes as the GOP race for the White House shifts to New Hampshire, where Trump's lead is the narrowest.
It's also where Haley is polling her best, with one recent survey showing she has trimmed Trump's lead in the state to single digits. 
And with its more moderate, college-educated electorate, the Granite State GOP primary Jan. 23 could be the last chance for Trump's rivals to slow his march to the nomination.
"These next seven days, it's literally life or death for all of the non-Trump candidates that are still in the race here," said Jim Merrill, a veteran New Hampshire GOP strategist who is neutral in the 2024 primary.
And Haley?
"If Nikki Haley wins in Hampshire, it resets the whole narrative of the primary," he said. "At a minimum, it stretches things out for a few weeks and it makes South Carolina enormously impactful, too. But it would also send a message, a message that Trump can be beaten."
That's a stark contrast to Iowa, where Trump was always widely expected to win. The final results showed not even a blizzard with sub-zero temperatures could stop the former president's dominance in the race.
Trump won in Iowa by nearly 30 points statewide, carrying 98 of the state's 99 counties. In Johnson County, the lone spot on the map that Trump didn't win, Haley claimed victory there by the slimmest possible margin: a single vote.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who went all-in on Iowa, came in second place with 21 percent of the vote, followed closely by Haley's 19 percent.
Before Haley boarded an overnight flight to New Hampshire, she was already eager to shed her underdog status.
Speaking to hundreds of supporters at the West Des Moines Marriott, Haley declared the Iowa results made the Republican primary a two-person race.
But with so much at stake, and with so much of Haley's own rise in the race connected to her strong debate performances, is Haley's Trump-or-bust a smart call or an unforced error?
It depends who you ask.
Rob Godfrey, Haley’s former longtime spokesman who is staying neutral in the primary, said the strategy makes sense to him.
"Between now and when voters go to the polls a week from now in New Hampshire, I don't know that there’s any time to illuminate any new information about anyone or anything," Godfrey said. "In that context, I’m not surprised to hear that there may be some fatigue among candidates and voters when it comes to debates."
Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan, said Haley's decision struck him as "presumptuous."
"Ultimatums usually would come from front-runners and from people who are doing better in the race. She's doing well in New Hampshire but, again, she's still behind Trump," said Kall, who has attended four of the five GOP presidential debates thus far.
He added, "She just doesn't have the juice to goad him onto the stage."
Kall conceded there doesn't seem to be as much of an appetite this cycle for presidential debates. In 2016, there were 12 Republican presidential debates.
On top of that, voters don't seem to care too much, either.
In the days leading up to the Iowa caucus, Nielsen ratings found some 4.3 million people watched Trump's town hall with Fox News. That was almost double the 2.6 million who tuned in for CNN's head-to-head debate between Haley and DeSantis at Drake University. 
Compare that to the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential race, which aired on Fox News and Fox Business in August. It drew 12.8 million viewers.
Merrill said Haley's decision cuts both ways. While it allows Haley's campaign to drive home the narrative that it is a two-person race between her and Trump, he said it also opens Haley up to criticism at a time when she's trying to build significant momentum in a short timeframe.
Haley's rivals have already pounced.
Chris LaCivita, a top Trump adviser, suggested that Haley's argument is laughable, at best. 
"Nikki Haley can’t even beat Rob DeSanctamonius despite millions in China-first, special-interest money," LaCivita told The Post and Courier. "And as far as debates are concerned, we are more than content to just watch her debate against herself and her 'evolving' pro-war, globalist policies her money men dictate."
DeSantis, who spent his morning campaigning in Haley's home state of South Carolina, said she didn't want to debate him again because "it didn't go well for her" when they faced off one-on-one at Drake University.
On social media, DeSantis went even further, accusing Haley of running to be Trump’s vice president.
"I won't snub New Hampshire voters like both Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, and plan to honor my commitments,” DeSantis said in the post. "I look forward to debating two empty podiums in the Granite State this week."
Haley defended her debate ultimatum in an interview with Dana Bash on CNN's "Inside Politics."
"I mean, that's who I'm running against. That's who I want," Haley said. "At the end of the day, he's the front-runner. He's the one that I'm seven points away from. He's the one that we're fighting for. There is nobody else I need to debate."
After Haley and Trump declined to participate by the Jan. 16 deadline, ABC News and Manchester TV station WMUR announced the Jan. 18 debate was canceled.
