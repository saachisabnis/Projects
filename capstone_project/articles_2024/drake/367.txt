Aaron Eckhart is to star in 'Scorpion'.

The 'Chief of Station' actor has signed up to star in director Jesse V. Johnson's upcoming action thriller, which has been written by Corey Large - who will also produce via his 308 Enterprises banner - and Ed Drake, Deadline reports.

'Scorpion' will follow a CIA assassin, who goes into hiding after taking the wrap for a failed mission. But when he reemerges, the past also comes back to haunt him and he needs to take down the agency boss who set him up in order to protect his daughter.

Further casting information will be announced in due course.

The 'Dark Knight' actor can next be seen in 'Deep Water' and a few months ago, he signed up to star in another of Jesse's films, 'Thieves Highway', with Devon Sawa.

Aaron will play an Oklahoma Stock Detective who is in over his head in the world of modern cattle rustling.

Travis Mills has written the film's script and it is being produced by Corey Large for his 308 Enterprises banner.

Meanwhile, Aaron previously revealed that he loves working on independent films as the cast and crew are always "on the edge".

He told The Hollywood Reporter: "Independent movie-making is certainly more like the Wild, Wild West. You're on the edge all the time. You don't know if you're going to make your days. You don't know if you're going to have enough money for the next day. There's also a lot of freedom in that.

"It's exciting to me because I can change the words if I want. I can improvise. I can make stuff up. When I'm on a big-budget movie, I'm not doing that. It's more corporate."
