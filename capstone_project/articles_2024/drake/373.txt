Best wishes to Javier Bernal.
Speaking on his Twitch stream, WWE NXT wrestler Javier Bernal announced that he suffered a broken foot during a dive at an NXT Level Up taping. As a result, he will be out of action for some period of time. Bernal said that he would miss six weeks without the surgery, but six months with it.
