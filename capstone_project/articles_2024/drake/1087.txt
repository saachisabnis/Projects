The top-three quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL draft are Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels, right?
Not so fast.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported on Monday that executives from other teams believe the Washington Commanders could be eyeing a quarterback projected to be further down the draft board with the No. 2 overall pick.
"When I've had conversations [at the NFL annual meeting] with executives from other teams, who know [Commanders general manager] Adam Peters well, know the situation well, the most popular answer for what they do at No. 2 is J.J. McCarthy," said Pelissero.
The Commanders taking McCarthy with the No. 2 pick would shake things up drastically.
That would likely put the New England Patriots in a position of choosing between Maye and Daniels with the No. 3 pick, assuming they resist the urge to trade down.
McCarthy's stock has slowly been on the rise with many projecting the Minnesota Vikings being a team to watch in a potential trade up scenario for the former Michigan quarterback.
Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh, who coached McCarthy at Michigan, even went as far as calling the prospect the best quarterback in this year's draft. If anything, this reporting is a reminder that the top-three might not be as set in stone as originally believed.
Let the draft drama begin.
