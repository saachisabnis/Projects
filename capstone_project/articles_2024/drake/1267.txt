LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansans received multiple alerts on their phones Wednesday about an armed man in Morrilton.
Officials with the Arkansas Department of Public Safety said the multiple alerts were for the sake of clarification. The first alert went out without a space between the information about the armed man, who is a suspect in multiple killings, and the web address where more information could be found, meaning the link did not work.

State officials said that because there was no space, people were not able to use the link, so a second message with the space in place was sent out.
Officials emphasized that the nature of the emergency made it important to notify all Arkansans as a matter of public safety.
Morrilton police and other law enforcement agencies are currently searching for an Alabama man wanted in connection with multiple out-of-state killings. The FBI notified Morrilton police after a vehicle used in the killings was spotted at a hotel in that city.

The suspect, 50-year-old Stacy Drake of Birmingham, Alabama, was not found at the hotel, and officials said they were unsure how he left. Investigators said they were able to identify Drake on hotel security camera footage.
The 5-foot 11-inch, 185-pound Drake is considered armed and dangerous. Officials said anyone who sees Drake should not approach but contact authorities by dialing 911 immediately.
