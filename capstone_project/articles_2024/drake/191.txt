When it comes to pizza, there are a lot folks in Colorado who absolutely love it. A Colorado-based pizza shop is bringing its 19th spot to Fort Collins.
They opened in Downtown Denver in the midst of the 1980s and have survived over four decades; it's a testament to their dedication and hard work. While a few Colorado locations have come and gone, but they push on.
They'll be taking over a spot that was home to a pizzeria that operated at the space for 15 years.
In 2023, after 15 years at the space, Pulcinella Pizzeria had to close its location in southeast Fort Collins due to devastating flooding. The spot is now home to a different but just as good pizzeria, so the tradition continues.
Anthony's Pizza & Pasta started out in Downtown Denver in 1984, probably with lots of new-wave and glam band tunes playing, and the staffers wearing lots of neon colors. 40 years later, the styles have changed but the great pizza and pasta continue.
There were a couple of Anthony's in Northern Colorado prior to this Fort Collins location; one in Longmont and one in Windsor. Both locations have since closed, so this is a return to the area for the company.
The new location, at 2550 East Harmony Road, next to Smashburger, will be hosting its grand opening on Friday, September 13, 2024 with an all-day party:
As this is a company-owned Anthony's, here's hoping they stick around a while.
