City planners will host a neighborhood compatibility meeting on Thursday, Feb. 1, on a proposal to build a 60-unit affordable housing development on 2.19 acres at 904 Greenville Highway.
Applicant Stephen Drake of Broadcraft Construction and Development Inc. and landowner Brett Barry of Gordon Dooley Holdings LLC are seeking a rezoning to permit construction of the low-income housing multi-family developmentthat would be funded through tax-credit financing. Gordon Dooley Holdings of Charleston, S.C., bought the property in May 2022 for $725,000, tax records show. The purchase price is the same as the taxable value of the vacant parcel.
The public meeting will be held at 2 p.m. Feb. 1 in the City Operations Center, 305 Williams St. A neighborhood compatibility meeting allows developers and zoning applicants to describe the project they want to build and respond to questions from the public.
