Travis Kelce and manager Aaron Eanes had a plan for 2023 to bring on a bunch of brand partners, showcase his abilities as a pitchman, and prove that brands were better off having him on their team.
Taylor Swift, a third Super Bowl title for his Kansas City Chiefs, and an ever-expanding audience for his New Heights podcast co-hosted by his recently retired NFL veteran brother Jason weren’t even in Kelce and Eanes’ playbook at the time.
“You’re kind of always reevaluating what’s going on with a brand, with your clients, and everything,” said Eanes, who serves as president of A&A Management group and, along with his brother André, have known Kelce since he was at the University of Cincinnati more than a decade ago.
