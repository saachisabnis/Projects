NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) — A date for the show-cause hearing was set Monday morning to decide whether the Covenant School mass shooter’s journals should be made public.
The hearing will take place April 16 and 17.
In the months following the shooting that claimed six innocent lives at the private elementary school, lawsuits filed by the National Police Association (NPA), The Tennessean, and Tennessee Firearms Association (TFA) called for the public release of writings left behind by shooter Audrey Hale. The school, a group of parents from Covenant, and others have argued the writings should not be released to avoid potential copycats and to allow for closure to the parents who lost children.
In November, three pages of the shooter’s graphic writings were leaked to podcast host Steven Crowder. They were later confirmed to be authentic. The hate-filled rhetoric included apparent motivations behind the attack, a to-do list for the day of the shooting, and Hale’s mindset.
Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said the shooter kept multiple journals, much more than the snapshots that were leaked. The leak reignited the debate on whether or not the full documents should be made public.
Live testimony is not expected for the hearing in April. Attorneys said Monday Covenant parents will make statements in written form.
