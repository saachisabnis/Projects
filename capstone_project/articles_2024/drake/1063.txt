We start talking about a man who was arrested trying to break into Will Smith’s house and someone getting shot out of Drake’s house in a drive-by-shooting. Abby comes on to talk more about the show she got booked at a California racetrack with George Birge. She answers our questions about the event. We also get an update about Wichita using “Hey There Hometown” in their campaign. We talk about Marvel doing less movies and TV shows and a gift that was sent to the studio by a listener for Bobby. Plus the time Amy went to someone’s house and put herself in a dangerous situation.
