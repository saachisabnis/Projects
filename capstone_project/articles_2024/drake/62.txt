Rodri is your 2024 Ballon d’Or winner!
The Manchester City and Spain superstar is the victor of the most prestigious award in the game of soccer, claiming the honor Monday after an exceptional campaign that saw him win both the Premier League championship with the Citizens and Euro 2024 with the Spanish national team.

Rodri beat out Real Madrid left winger Vinicius Junior, who came in second place and wasn’t present at the ceremony as a result. The rest of the delegation from Los Blancos also didn’t attend the ceremony at Paris, France’s Theatre du Chatelet. All parties were expected to be there, but they made the decision to not go because they were made aware ahead of schedule that Junior wouldn’t be winning the Ballon d’Or, per soccer insider Fabrizio Romano. Real Madrid was upset about the results and chose to skip out, according to theScore.com,
And here’s another interesting note from the 2024 Ballon d’Or ceremony: It was the first time since 2003 that both legends Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo weren’t involved with the voting, which is absolutely insane in itself.

LMAO … Real Madrid was on their grade-A petty ish with this one. It’s like when Drake called himself “the petty king” on Omertà; this is in that tier.
“Borderline dangerous, approach with caution/ I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction/ Man, truth be told, I think about it often/ The petty king”
Real Madrid is totally the kind of club to buy Rodri’s Ballon d’Or if he ever put it up for auction, and you’re hilariously seeing it in real time.
No cap, Real Madrid scores some cool points with me here.
Any team that goes all out for their players, even boycotting award shows because they ain’t winning, it’s admirable. Funny, but admirable.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
