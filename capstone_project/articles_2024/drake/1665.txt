The New England Patriots planned to have Jacoby Brissett on the field for one or two drives in their preseason finale against the Washington Commanders on Sunday night.
However, an injury caused the veteran quarterback to leave the game even earlier after just seven plays. The Patriots announced he was "questionable" to return before the first half expired. Brissett finished the night completing two of four passes for 19 yards. 
Brissett was sacked for a seven-yard loss on first down by an untouched KJ Henry at the New England 46-yard line.
NBC's Melissa Stark said on the broadcast that Brissett was "grimacing" on the Patriots sideline and grabbing his right shoulder.

Drake Maye came in for the Patriots' second drive of the game and led New England 88 yards downfield for his first passing touchdown of the preseason.
The rookie connected with Kevin Harris for the 18-yard score after going five-for-six on the drive for 71 yards and a 17-yard scramble for a first down on third-and-14.
