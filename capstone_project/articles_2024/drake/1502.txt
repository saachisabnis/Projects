Nestled in the heart of Dubuque, Iowa, lies a trove of history waiting to be uncovered. At the EB Lyons Interpretive Center, visitors can embark on a journey through time, delving into the fascinating tales of Dubuque's past. Additionally, the area surrounding the center has its trails and stories to unravel as well.
Hiking has steadily become my family's escape, and this section of the Mines of Spain offers a good deal of history, beautiful sites, and some great exercise. As you can see in just under 20 minutes my wife and I were able to walk the short loop to Pine Chapel and back to the EB Lyons Center, all while learning much about our local history.
One such tale revolves around Julien Dubuque, a French-Canadian pioneer who arrived in the area in 1785. Dubuque's ventures led him to secure the right to work the lead mines, now known as the Mines of Spain. Despite facing disputes over ownership, his legacy endures, immortalized by the United States Supreme Court's ruling in 1853.
The Mines of Spain stand as a testament to Dubuque's enduring spirit. Once a thriving hub of activity, today it offers a glimpse into Iowa's Native American history. From the Meskwaki and Sauk tribes' struggles to retain their lands to the tranquil beauty of the surrounding landscape, the Mines of Spain hold stories that span centuries.
The Nature Center itself is a blast as well. Historical displays divulge details of Native American life, nature displays paint a picture of biodiversity, and the basement houses some great animal displays, including live animals. For instance, this really cool snapping turtle that was definitely not camera-shy. Check him out!
Amidst all this history stands the Pine Chapel, a symbol of resilience and community. Built by Otto Junkermann, a German immigrant and pioneering druggist, the chapel served as a focal point for social gatherings and trade. Its walls whisper tales of clandestine dealings during Prohibition and the bustling energy of Dubuque's early settlers.
As visitors tread the hallowed grounds of Dubuque, they become part of its storied narrative. Whether exploring the Mines of Spain's natural splendor, uncovering the Pine Chapel's secrets, or becoming immersed in Dubuque's vibrant history and wildlife at the EB Lyons Interpretive Center, one thing is certain – the past lives on in every corner of Dubuque.
