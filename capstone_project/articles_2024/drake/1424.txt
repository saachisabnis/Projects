J. Cole recently confirmed that he’s finishing up work on his upcoming album, The Fall Off. 
The artist announced the news during the Tampa, Florida stop of his and Drake’s ongoing “It’s All A Blur – Big as the What?” tour. “Right now, I’m at the tail end of working on this album I’ve been working on for a long time,” Cole announce during the tour’s opening. “It’s called The Fall Off.” The Boy showed his support for his friend and tourmate, noting that he’s already listened to the “classic” project.
The Fall Off will follow 2021’s The Off-Season, which went on to debut at No. 1 and earn Cole a GRAMMY nomination for Best Rap Album. It’s been long-rumored that The Fall Off will be one of if not the last album he’ll be releasing before his retirement; in a now-deleted post on Instagram, Cole posted a list of what seems like album titles, with The Fall Off being the last one the list and the caption reading “I still got some goals I gotta check off for’ I scram…” He also previously hinted at the possibility of retirement in his essay for The Players’ Tribune where he wrote, “On my career bucket list, there remain a few more items to check off before I give myself permission to enter whatever the next chapter of my life may be.”
Stay tuned for an official release date.
