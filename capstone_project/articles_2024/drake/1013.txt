Remember when Jon Bon Jovi saved a lady from taking her own life while shooting a music video, well the video is out for all to see.
On World Suicide Prevention Day, Jon Bon Jovi was filming the video for "The People's House" on the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in Nashville, when he noticed a woman preparing to jump into the Cumberland River. Jon approached the woman and with the help of another person who happened to be on the bridge, he was able to talk the lady down and step back over the guard rail to safety.
â€œIt takes all of us to help keep each other safe." said Nashville PD Chief John Drake.
There wasn't a report as to what became of the lady after the event, but it's great to see when people can stop and be supportive in time's of need. 
Good work Jon.
