A 75-year-old Manchester, N.H., man who was found with fatal injuries early Sunday morning died from a stab wound to his chest, officials said.
An autopsy found that the wound was the cause of Vernon Hayford’s death, and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to a statement from the New Hampshire attorney general’s office.
Carrie Drake, 54, is charged with second-degree murder for “recklessly causing the death of Vernon Hayford under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life by stabbing him,” the statement said.  She is also charged with resisting arrest and being a felon in possession of a deadly weapon.
Drake waived arraignment on the charges Monday and is being held without bail, prosecutors said.
Officials said Sunday that Manchester police responded to a 911 call from an apartment at 259 Chestnut St. about 5 a.m. and arrived to find Hayward suffering from life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died.
