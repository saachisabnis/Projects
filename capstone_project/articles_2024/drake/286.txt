Terrance "Gangsta" Williams weighed in on Big Meech's claim that the Black Mafia Family (BMF) could have been bigger than Cash Money. Williams dismissed the notion, emphasizing that BMF lacked the musical talent necessary to rival Cash Money's success. Williams acknowledged BMF's monetary power but noted that "you also have to have an ear for talent." In contrast, Cash Money's founders, Birdman and Slim, consistently discovered and nurtured superstar talent, contributing to multiple successful eras featuring artists like Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake. Williams concluded by asserting that despite BMF's financial might, their lack of musical prowess prevented them from achieving the legendary status of Cash Money.
