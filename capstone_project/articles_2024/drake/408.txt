Plans to convert part of The Range’s Plymouth HQ into a Majestic Wine shop have been unveiled. The scheme will allow change of use of the premises from office to retail sales to allow the occupation by the wine retailer.
The site on William Prance Road forms part of The Range HQ. But due to changes in office working patterns and the rise of AI, the area subject to the application is underutilised and not required by The Range.
Plans therefore have been submitted for a proposal which the applicants say makes best use of existing floorspace, providing active frontage and retail development, encouraging linked trips and bringing cohesion to the development of the District Centre, particularly linking the retail currently under construction with the existing The Range store.

The application seeks full planning permission for the change of use of the premises from office to retail sales. There would also be minor external alterations to create a new entrance into the unit.
Subject to planning approval by Plymouth City Council, the new Majestic Wine would be open Monday to Saturday – 9am to 8pm, and Sunday 10am to 5pm.
A statement in support of the planning application says: “It is considered that the application is of significant merit. The proposal represents inward investment into the area, making best use of underutilised space.
“The proposal will support local residents and businesses, improving and extending the retail offer, the proposal will provide additional skilled jobs on site; and the proposal will create an active frontage and provide a connection between The Range retail unit and new retail development currently under construction to ensure the vitality and viability of Derriford District Centre.
“No sequentially preferable sites have been identified in the wider urban area of Plymouth, and given the nature of the proposal it is not considered that any impact arises. Due consideration has been given to amenity and transport issues and the proposal is considered to be a suitable use in this location respecting the surrounding uses and its location on the highway network.”
Plymouth City Council planners will determine the fate of all the new applications listed below at a later date. Below is the full latest list of planning applications that have been submitted this week.
