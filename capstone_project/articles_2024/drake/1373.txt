The Blanden Memorial Art Museum, 920 Third Ave. S., will hold a reception for Colin C. Smith from 2 to 4 p.m. on Feb. 17. Refreshments will be served.
Smith’s exhibit is called “Soft Geometry.” A statement from the Blanden states that Smith’s “latest exhibit is a captivating exploration of material sensitivity and abstract expressionism, seamlessly transcending traditional boundaries. The displayed pieces,  reminiscent of barn quilts, feature playful yet intricate forms with a bumpy, tactile surface that immediately draws attention.”
Smith was born and raised in central Nebraska during the middle of the 20th century. After receiving a bachelor of fine arts in painting from the University of Nebraska Omaha, Smith received his master of fine arts degree in printmaking at Drake University in Des Moines. Smith has exhibited his work nationally and is currently on art faculty at University of Nebraska Omaha.
