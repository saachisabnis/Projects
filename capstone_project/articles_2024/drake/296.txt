DES MOINES, Iowa (KTIV) - On Friday it was day 2 down at Big Blue, and Siouxland track and field athletes were looking to find themselves on the podium at the Iowa High School State Track meet.
In the high jump, Emmetsburg’s Rachel Schany was one of the final two competing. While neither Schany nor her opponent could get over 5 foot 5, Schany won with one less fail through the competition, taking 1st.
“It takes a lot of hours and dedication, and so much time after practice and I just have to thank my coaches and my family and my teammates for helping me,” said Schany.
Over at the class 3A long jump, Mackenzie Harder of Storm Lake came up with a leap of 17-09.50 to finish in 4th.
3A boys 400-meter hurdles, Quinn Olson hauled down the track and finished with a PR of 52.97 and took 3rd.
In the boy’s 800 wheelchair, West Lyon’s Xander Rentschler rolled in with a personal record, coming in 3rd with a time of 2:37.84 but Renschler is just happy to be at big blue.
“As the announcer said its the best track meet and I mean a little reverence to Drake yeah, It’s almost unreal how many people come to watch this every year and every year it gets better,” said Rentschler.
In the afternoon sessions, boys’ distance medley Sibley Ocheydan was off to a solid start, entering the 400 up near the front of the pack. In the final leg, Generals were still up front but Sibley Ocheyedan took 3rd with a time of 3:35.30.
1A Discus, Ian Blowe of Akron-Westfield, who already claimed his second straight shot put title, claimed his second straight title in the Discus as well.
“The closest thing I’ve seen (to the state meet) is when we made it to playoffs in football but that’s not anywhere near this. I mean just the people the environment it’s just great,” said Blowe.
