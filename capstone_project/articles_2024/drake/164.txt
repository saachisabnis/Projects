Most of the early Castle Valley River Ranchos residents had to enter the subdivision by crossing Castle Creek to gain access to their homes. At the time, Castle Valley Drive meandered down to the creek at a right angle, crossed the creek over a six-foot culvert then back up the other side to join where the current road is located.

It was a quaint and picturesque drive through the creek but presented several problems, including being routinely washed out during heavy rain events. In addition to the rain, the road could be a real mess during the winter months because the south side of the creek was always shaded and it was either very slippery from the ice or extremely muddy in the afternoon from the snowmelt.




The school bus had to chain up on the north side to have any chance of making it through the creek to the other side. Later in the day when folks were coming home from work the south side of the creek would be so soupy that vehicles would get stuck in the muck. It wasn’t uncommon to see a half-dozen cars sunk in the mire, blocking the road. The only way to get out was to wait until the road froze so you could drive out.



The newly-formed Castle Valley Property Owner’s Association board of directors took on this problem as one of its first projects and, despite the objections of one of the board members, ordered a new culvert. In the June 7, 1979, Castle Valley Comments I wrote:



“Men of the valley were busy this past week assembling the new culvert, which arrived May 29. Nearly completed, it stands 10 feet tall and measures 65 feet long. The creek bed will be prepared possibly as soon as next week, then the culvert will be lowered into place. Some of the men working on the project in the evenings were Fred Johnson, Merrill Brady, Don Pueblo, Jim Oakden, Ron Young, Mike Ricketts, Bob Hanson, Gil Haegele, Joe Jarman Walt and Jack Cluff and myself.”



Brady Johnson was a member of the board of directors at the time and along with Merrill Brady, was the driving force behind the new culvert. The new culvert was moved upstream about 300 feet from the original location to avoid the twists and turns through the creek. On July 5 I wrote: “County road crews are working to put the new culvert into place in Castle Creek and bringing fill dirt to cover it. Work began last week when the workers had to extract the 10-foot by 65-foot culvert out of a wash because high winds rolled it from the assembly site about 75 feet into the wash. Fred Johnson reported that a few more days will be required to finish the project.”



After the installation, the culvert was the topic of conversation during POA meetings over the next few years regarding erosion during flooding. In March 1981, road committee member Bob Hanson inquired about installing a concrete curtain on the east end of the culvert and he was asked to develop a plan and get bids to finish the project. The following March 1982, POA Chair Ken Devore stated that erosion was threatening the culvert and that an apron must be installed “before it’s too late.”



In the meantime, Castle Valley Drive was graded down on each approach to the creek, and the resulting material was placed on top of the culvert to make the approach less steep and raise the roadbed over the culvert. Concrete companies were also asked to deposit their excess concrete on the east end to help create a concrete apron to help with erosion.



Between the concrete and loads of large rocks, the east end of the culvert had a decent apron. But the POA was still talking about an apron in December 1984. They said water from the creek was eroding around the culvert. In August 1987 heavy rain caused major damage to property along Shafer and Buchanan lanes when flood water ran over the creek banks and washed out driveways, isolating one home. The rising water peaked about four feet above the top of the Castle Creek culvert before it receded but the culvert withstood the test.



By July 1988, the Town of Castle Valley had obtained a Community Impact Board grant to do an engineering study on the town’s roads and drainage and hired Armstrong Consultants of Grand Junction to do the job. Based on aerial photographs taken by the firm, the company made specific recommendations and put culverts first on their agenda.



They eventually recommended the installation of flared ends on all of the culverts to maximize the capacity of the culverts including the large one at Castle Valley Drive. The company representative “felt comfortable” with the 10-foot culvert handling flood waters, but mentioned the vegetation around the culvert was restricting the capacity.



It was that flared end that came loose during the latest storm on June 27 causing Castle Valley Drive to shut down for about 10 minutes. The flared end was dislodged from the culvert and was sucked through the culvert, making horrible noises, and became lodged against a footbridge a little downstream on Merrill and Linda Brady’s property.



Town officials feared the culvert was breaking apart and closed the road as a precaution. The Utah Department of Transportation was asked last week to inspect the culvert for worthiness. They were not overly concerned but made no official comment until their engineers could look at it.



That culvert has served the community for just over 45 years now and alleviated a desperate creek-crossing situation thanks to dedicated community leaders at the time. Who knows? It might have another 45 years of life left in it.

The flared end was dislodged from the culvert and was sucked through the culvert, making horrible noises, and became lodged against a footbridge a little downstream on Merrill and Linda Brady’s property.



Town officials feared the culvert was breaking apart and closed the road as a precaution. The Utah Department of Transportation was asked last week to inspect the culvert for worthiness. They were not overly concerned but made no official comment until their engineers could look at it.



That culvert has served the community for just over 45 years now and alleviated a desperate creek-crossing situation thanks to dedicated community leaders at the time. Who knows? It might have another 45 years of life left in it.
