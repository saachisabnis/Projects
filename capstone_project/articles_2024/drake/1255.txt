WICHITA FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - Oncor is investigating an outage that’s impacting a popular retail strip in Wichita Falls.
Just before 7:00 p.m., 375 customers lost power along Lawrence Road, McNiel Avenue and Maplewood Avenue.
We’ve received multiple calls about outages at businesses on Lawrence Road. Law enforcement officials are directing traffic in the area.
Oncor Area Manager Gordon Drake confirms this is a bird problem. He says a conductor burned in two, due to an excessive number of birds along the line.
They have contacted Oncor’s environmental department to see what provisions may be done until the birds migrate out of the area. Oncor crews are on the scene working to restore power.
Drivers should avoid the area. We will update you as we learn more.
