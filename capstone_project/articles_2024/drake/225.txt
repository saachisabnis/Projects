It is almost Pride Month!
In preparation, the Grand Rapids Pride Center announced their official headliner for this year's festivities.
Am I the only person freaking out over this announcement?
If you have no clue who Big Freedia is, you have been living under a rock.
Known as the Queen of New Orleans Bounce music, Big Freedia is a nationally recognized hip-hop artist, TV personality, and cultural influencer.
In 2022, Big Freedia made headlines recently for her feature on Beyonce’s Grammy-Award-winning single, “Break My Soul.”
Besides her Beyonce feature, she has her own critically acclaimed EPs, ‘3rd Ward Bounce’ (2018), ‘Louder’ (2020), and ‘Big Diva Energy’ (2021).
She has also been featured on other  projects, including Beyonce's ‘Formation,’ and Drake’s ‘Nice For What.’
Now, Big Freedia will be blessing us with her presence this summer!
With Big Freedia as the headliner, when is the Grand Rapids Pride Festival?
Since 1988, Grand Rapids has held a Pride Celebration. Going into its 36th year, the Pride Center has announced this year's festival day and time.
The Grand Rapids Pride Festival is happening on June 22nd, 2024 from 12:00 PM to 10:00 PM at Calder Plaza!
The festival is free for everyone to attend, but donations are always appreciated to help support the center's various programs and services.
The Grand Rapids Pride Center is looking for vendors for the Pride Festival this year.
You can sign up to become a vendor at GR Pride's website.
As of now, there are no further details that were announced. However, as the days come, there will be plenty.
