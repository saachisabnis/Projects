Steve Harvey and contestants were stumped when Family Feud rejected some big names as answers to the prompt "Who Is the GOAT Rapper?"
In an episode aired on Tuesday (July 16), singer Meghan Trainor, her husband, actor Daryl Sabara, and vocalist Tori Kelly were among those who participated on the ABC game show. When Sabara and his competitor Murillo, named J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar, respectively, the answers were shut down, with Team Trainor and Team Tori taking the lead.
Lil Wayne also surprisingly didn't make the scoreboard, while 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and JAY-Z did. Harvey remarked that Jay should be "number one," and when the Brooklyn native was given the eighth spot, Harvey exclaimed, "Ah, y'all trippin'. We in Rhode Island again? Where we at?"
As the game continued, JAY-Z's once-rival Nas also missed the mark, prompting Harvey to say, "I think you're thinking as a hip-hop head. I don't think that's who answered these questions."
Eminem made third place, while Snoop Dogg took the number one spot, which surprised Harvey again. Other answers that were thrown out were Big Z (who's actually a producer) and Drake, both who didn't make the cut.
Towards the conclusion, Harvey said, "Before we flip over these last three, I want to apologize to the entire hip-hop community. 'JAY-Z's last.' What the world?"
The last three names that were missed included 50 Cent, LL Cool J, who Harvey called a "bad boy," and Dr. Dre.
Family Feud had a rap-focused July, with Megan Thee Stallion also appearing in a recent episode.
