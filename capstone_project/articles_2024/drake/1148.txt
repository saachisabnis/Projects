A$AP Rocky recently hosted a listening party for his upcoming Don’t Be Dumb album. Set to release at the end of next month, the rapper is gearing up for the drop, which will be his first full-length studio album since 2018. A much-hyped album, fans are eager to know what is in store. 
At the listening party, the A$AP Rocky appears to reveal a snippet of a new collaborative track with Tyler, the Creator. According to NFR Podcast, the New York rapper gave attendees a glimpse at the new album. In one clip, fans can hear Tyler’s verse complement Rocky’s signature style. Just recently, the duo took to the Coachella stage to perform “Who Dat Boy,” surprising fans. In the past, the two have come together for fire anthems like “POTATO SALAD” and “TELEPHONE CALLS.” The mob mentality continues as the reveals a couple of new tracks alongside a teaser that a J. Cole album is on the way. 
NFR Podcast is also speculating that Rocky has a response to Drake for allegedly dragging his baby mama Rihanna on For All the Dogs as well as calling him out on “Family Matters.” Kast One said, “I heard songs being played. I heard Slick Rick [on it]. That was amazing. I also heard A$AP Rocky definitely addressing a lot of the main topics that are happening out here right now. Let’s just say, the list keeps going on strong.” Ebro asked Kast One to clarify, “So you saying Rocky is still on Drake’s list is what you saying?” to which Kast One said, “Oh, he’s going to be cemented on the list after this,” insinuating that the pair will continue their beef after the album drops.
