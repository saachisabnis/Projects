Close friends of the late XXXTentacion have denounced a wild theory about the Florida rapper's death. The drama began a few days after the sixth anniversary of X's death. Boxer Ryan Garcia took to X, formerly known as Twitter, and made the outrageous claim that Drake had a hand in the "Look At Me!" artist's murder. "F**k it drake killed x," he wrote. "Don't screenshot. Just kidding I don't give a f**k."Garcia later retracted his claim and deleted the post. However, his words still sparked backlash from XXXTentacion's childhood friends and collaborators like Ski Mask The Slump God and DJ Scheme. 
"Whoever Believe This Stupid S**t Too Deep In The YouTube Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Go Outside Touch Grass My N***a," Ski wrote. "Thank you," DJ Scheme replied. Scheme offered more thoughts about Drake following his friend's passing in a separate post. "My Only Issue Is That After My Brother Died All Drake Did Was Throw Shots To Look More Gangster," he wrote. "So To Wrap Things Up Itâ€™s Still F**k Drake."
The past beef between Drake and XXXTentacion fueled the conspiracy theories. The two artists' issues goes back to 2017 when Drake dropped his More Life album in 2017. The project contains a song called "KMT" featuring Giggs. X believed Drake's flow on the song sounded similar to his track "Look At Me!" and called out the Toronto rapper. A few months before he died in 2018, X posted an Instagram Story that said "If anyone tries to kill me, it was Drake." He later deleted it and claimed his account was hacked. XXXTentacion was shot and killed in Deerfield Beach on June 18, 2018. The 20-year-old was fatally shot while four men robbed him of $50,000. Dedrick Williams, Robert Allen, Trayvon Newsome and the shooter Michael Boatwright were arrested and charged with his murder. Williams, Newsome, and Boatwright were convicted of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm after Allen accepted a plea deal and testified against his co-defendants. Despite the defense's attempts, no evidence tied Drake to the crime.
