One of AEW’s top tag teams is coming to indie promotion Deadlock Pro Wrestling.
Deadlock Pro announced today that FTR (Dax Harwood & Cash Wheeler) will compete at their Super Battle show in Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday, October 13. The show, which is taking place from the Grady Cole Center, is being promoted as the biggest event in DPW’s three-year history. KENTA and Masato Tanaka have also been announced for the event.
FTR’s match for Super Battle has not been announced yet. It’s a hometown booking for them with Harwood and Wheeler both being from North Carolina.
See y’all in FTR Country. @deadlockpro https://t.co/wYrz9M3rmH
Indie appearances are infrequent for FTR, though they are also set to compete for Prestige Wrestling in Portland, Oregon on Sunday, September 29. They are facing Pacific Northwest tag team Midnight Heat (Eddie Pearl & Ricky Gibson) at that show.
FTR are coming off a victory over The Grizzled Young Veterans (Zack Gibson & James Drake) on AEW Collision this past Saturday. The episode ended with Harwood & Wheeler posing with The Outrunners after Truth Magnum & Turbo Floyd saved them from a post-match beatdown.
