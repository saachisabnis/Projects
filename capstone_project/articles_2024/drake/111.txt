In 2021, Dave Aranda was viewed as one of the top head coaches in college football after leading Baylor to a sensational season.
That year, Aranda, in his second season with the Bears, led them to a 12-2 record, a win in the Sugar Bowl and a No. 5 national ranking.
Now, entering his fifth season in Waco, Texas, Aranda is riding the hot seat.
This summer, BuffZone will preview each of Colorado’s opponents for the 2024 season and in this installment we look at Baylor, which will visit Boulder on Sept. 21.
Back-to-back losing seasons, including 3-9 last year, have brought a sense of urgency to the Bears, who are eager to get back on track. It’s the first time Baylor has experienced back-to-back losing campaigns since a 14-year run of losing seasons from 1996-2009.
There is some pressure on Aranda to win this year, but there’s support for him, as well.
“I’m standing 10 toes down with coach Aranda,” analyst Robert Griffin III, the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner from Baylor, said in a recent interview on 365 Sports. “I’m really excited for this football season. I’m excited for coach Dave Aranda, because I know if you back that man into a corner, he’s going to come out swinging, and I expect the Bears to come out swinging this year.”
To do that, the Bears will have a new look, especially on offense.
First-year coordinator Jake Spavital has installed a new offense and Aranda praised the fast tempo during the spring.
It’s an offense that could be led by transfer quarterback DeQuan Finn, a three-year starter at Toledo. Last year’s backup, Sawyer Robertson, is competing, as well, and the Bears came out of spring practices without naming a starter.
In addition to a new starter at quarterback, the Bears will have a retooled receiver room and a rebuilt offensive line. Baylor gave up the most sacks (34) in the Big 12 last year and added a handful of transfer linemen.
Defensively, the Bears struggled last year, allowing 34-plus points seven times. However, there are several good players back, as well some newcomers expecting to make an immediate impact, so there is hope for improvement.
Aranda said after the spring game that the linebacker room could be special. It’s led by last year’s top tackler, Matt Jones. Transfer Keaton Thomas, a junior college All-American last year, could have a significant impact, as well.
On special teams, the Bears return their kicker and punter. Isaiah Hankins made 18-of-25 field goals, including 2-of-3 from beyond 50 yards. Palmer Williams averaged 43.03 yards per punt.
Another key to Baylor’s chances to get back on the winning track is the schedule. Utah, Kansas State and Arizona are widely considered three of the top contenders in the Big 12 and the Bears don’t play any of them in conference play (they do face Utah in a non-conference game). Two other top contenders, Kansas and Oklahoma State, come to Waco.

QB DeQuan Finn: A transfer from Toledo, where he played for five years. During his three seasons as a starter, he completed 60.4% of his passes for 6,984 yards, 63 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. He also ran for 1,695 yards and 25 touchdowns.
CB Caden Jenkins: One of the top freshmen in the country last year, he had 37 tackles, three interceptions and two fumble recoveries – one of which he returned for a touchdown.
LB Matt Jones: Led Baylor with 82 tackles and 11.5 tackles for loss last year, earning All-Big 12 honorable mention. He also had three sacks and five pass breakups. He’s started all 24 games the past two seasons and has 33 starts in the last three years, racking up 198 tackles, 23 TFL and 7.5 sacks in that time.
RB Dominic Richardson: In his first season at Baylor, he led the Bears in rushing with 519 yards on 125 carries (4.2 per carry) and one touchdown. He added 21 catches for 152 yards and a touchdown. In three years at Oklahoma State, he rushed for 1,139 yards on 272 carries (4.2 per carry) with 15 touchdowns.
• CU and Baylor have played 16 times, but only seven of those games were played as Big 12 Conference rivals. The Buffs and Bears played nine times before the Big Eight expanded to the Big 12 in 1996, adding Baylor and others. CU was 4-3 against the Bears during the previous Big 12 era (1996-2010).
• Baylor will bring a two-game Folsom Field winning streak into this year’s game, beating the Buffs in 2006 and 2010 in Boulder.
• Since 2010, Baylor has been to 11 bowl games in 14 seasons. The Bears finished ranked among the top 15 in the Associated Press poll in six of those seasons.
• Dating back to the 2022 season, Baylor is 3-13 in its last 16 games, including 2-10 in conference play.
• Last year, Baylor finished last in the Big 12 in scoring defense, allowing 33.3 points per game. The Bears also tied for last in scoring offense, at 23.1 points per game.
• Baylor hired Jake Spavital as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in the offseason. Spavital was the offensive coordinator at California last season and spent the previous four years (2019-22) as the head coach at Texas State. He’s had previous stints as the offensive coordinator at West Virginia, Cal and Texas A&M.
• Matt Powledge returns for his second season as defensive coordinator. He was the co-DC at Oregon in 2022 and was on the Baylor staff in 2020-21 as the special teams coordinator.
It’s been a busy offseason for the Bears, with 15 players transferring out and 16 coming in. Among the players that have left are last year’s starting quarterback, Blake Shapen (Mississippi State); the top two tight ends, Drake Dabney (TCU) and Jake Roberts (Oklahoma); and reserve receivers Armani Winfield (Colorado State) and Jordan Nabors (Stephen F. Austin). The most impactful incoming transfer figures to be Finn, who takes over as the starting quarterback. After giving up the most sacks in the Big 12, Baylor added five transfer offensive linemen, a group that could be led by Sidney Fugar (South Carolina). Receiver Ashtyn Hawkins caught 141 passes in three seasons at Texas State, while Jamaal Bell caught 76 passes in four seasons at Nevada, along with setting a school record for kickoff return yards. Safety Cameren Jenkins (UNLV) is the twin brother of Caden Jenkins and posted 32 tackles last year. Tight end Michael Trigg (Mississippi), edge Steven Linton (Texas Tech), safety Kendrick Simpkins (Western Kentucky) and linebacker Keaton Thomas (Northeast Mississippi C.C.) could also be impactful players.
