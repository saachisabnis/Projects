The Miami Dolphins selected running back Kenyan Drake in the third-round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He gave Dolphins fans an all-time great memory. 
Former Miami Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake announced his retirement on Friday, ending an eight-season career that included an all-time great Dolphins moment. Drake entered the league as a third-round pick by Miami in 2016, but it is a touchdown he scored in 2018 that will forever be the highlight people remember.
On December 28, 2018, the Dolphins trailed the New England Patriots by five points with seven seconds remaining on the clock and had the ball on their own 31-yard line. A last gasp for Miami was expected, a miracle was not. The Dolphins got the miracle.

Quarterback Ryan Tannehill threw a pass 17 yards to wide receiver Kenny Stills near midfield. Stills looked to make a move up-field but then flipped the ball to wide receiver DeVante Parker, who found some space and picked up five yards before he tossed the ball to Drake. Catching the ball in stride at the Dolphinsâ€™ 48-yard line, Drake broke a tackle, then looked to lateral the ball to someone else. But no Patriots defenders were tackling the running back, either. So he continued to make cuts and work his way upfield.
Suddenly, the defense parted and Drake made for the endzone - largely thanks to a block by guard Ted Larsen. Tight end Rob Gronkowski, on the field to provide New England with a big safety as a prevention for a Hail Mary pass from Tannehill, could not make the tackle on Drake, and the Dolphins won the game as Drake reached the endzone.
The Miami Miracle, as the play became known, is the longest game-winning play from scrimmage in regulation in NFL history, at 69 yards. After the 2018 season, it won the NFL Honors Play of the Year award. 
And, Gronkowski still does not have the angle.
Drake was traded by Miami to the Arizona Cardinals during the 2019 season. He finished 2019 and played the 2020 season with the Cardinals before signing as a free agent with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021. He was released by the Raiders during the 2022 preseason, signing with the Baltimore Ravens for the year. He started 2023 with the Indianapolis Colts, but was released at the end of the preseason. He returned to the Ravens as a practice squad player for part of the season, before having practice squad stints with the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers to finish the year.

With Miami, Drake ran for 1,532 yards on 333 carries in 54 games, including 16 starts. He averaged 4.6 yards per carry with nine touchdowns. He also caught 116 passes for 936 yards with six scores.
Drake ran for 3,866 yards on 869 carries for a 4.4 yards per carry average for his career. He had 33 career rushing touchdowns and eight receiving touchdowns on 218 receptions for 1,655 yards.
Good luck to Drake! Thank you for the memories!
