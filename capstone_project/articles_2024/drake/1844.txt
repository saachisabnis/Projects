I love the outdoors. Hiking. Camping. Fishing. Kayaking. However, it's no shock to know that I also loathe certain aspects of each of those. For hiking it's the always dreaded chaffing. With camping, it's the bugs. While fishing it's always the process of cleaning them. And while kayaking nothing is more revolting than our all to necessary reptilian friends. You know...
Anyway... if you're an avid adventurer planning to explore the waterways of Iowa, brace yourself for encounters with slithery residents. You're guaranteed to spot them, and here's why. Two of the most snake-infested rivers in the United States flow alongside either side of Iowa: the mighty Mississippi and the "Big Muddy" Missouri River.
Now, before you start envisioning Indiana Jones-like snake-burning scenes, let's delve into the fascinating world of these serpentine creatures. According to A-Z Animals, the United States boasts around 50 snake species, with about 30 of them venomous. While Iowa may not be home to all 50, it hosts a significant portion (28), thanks to its geographic location, abundant waterways, and humid summer climate.
So you're aware, Iowa has only four venomous snakes, and their bites are rarely fatal if treated. The massasauga and timber rattlesnakes are rare but found in eastern and southern Iowa. The prairie rattlesnake and copperhead are even more rare in our state. By the way, snakes are protected in Iowa so they shouldn't be collected or killed in any instance,
Let's take a closer look at these two rivers and the scaly residents that call them home.
The Mississippi River needs no introduction. Spanning the American Midwest and Southeast, it's one of the most iconic rivers in the nation. But did you know it's also a hotspot for snakes? Numerous snake species lurk along its banks, from the docile Northern water snake to the menacing Timber rattlesnake.
Despite its reputation as a snake haven, the Mississippi River doesn't necessarily welcome human-snake encounters with open arms. Most snake populations in the area are skittish and prefer to keep their distance from us, bipedal creatures. So, while you're admiring the river's majestic expanse, rest assured that snakes are more likely to dart away than at you.
If the Mississippi River is the king of snake-infested waters, then the Missouri River is its equally formidable counterpart. Stretching over 2,540 miles through the American Midwest, the Missouri River teems with wildlife, (I should know. I was just there!) including a staggering variety of snakes. As many as 47 snake species may call this river home, making it a mecca for reptile enthusiasts and cautious adventurers alike.
Among the snakes that inhabit the Missouri River are the Diamondback water snake, the Yellow-bellied water snake, and the notorious Water moccasin, also known as the Cottonmouth. With such a diverse array of species, it's no wonder this river ranks high on the list of snake-infested waterways.
