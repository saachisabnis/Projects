Gary Owen is speaking out about the status of his relationship with his ex-wife Kenya Duke.
The "Think Like a Man Too" actor said he is "cordial" with Duke while performing at a comedy show.  On Friday, Owen shared a snippet on Instagram of an audience member asking him "Do you and the ex get along?"
"That's a legitimate question," Owen answered. "We're cordial. But yeah, I wouldn't say we're best buds."
The Cincinnati native joked how he needs "someone to f*****g d**k her down. I think that'll do it. Like blow her f*****g back all the way out. She'll probably be like, 'How you doing, Gary?' " he said in a softer voice.
Owen, 50, continued: "Like, 'Oh s**t, somebody got some d**k!' I don't know. We OK... That was a good question ...We aight."

In the post's caption, Duke tagged the comedian, saying she has always been "kind and cool with you" in the last "3 years."
"I purposely, never make it awkward. I never bother you. I have given you my suggestions on the situation but you don't respect their boundaries. Which is why you discussed this again on social media," she wrote.
She concluded in the caption: "I don't know what else to do to help you. Always wishing you well."
Owen was married to Kenya Duke from 2003 to 2021. They share two biological children; he is the stepfather of Duke's son, born in a previous relationship. Owen is now engaged to Bri Johnson. They welcomed twins together last July.
