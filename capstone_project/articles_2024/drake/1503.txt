Houston rapper BeatKing died Thursday, his manager announced. He was 39.
“Today, August 15, 2024 we have lost @clubgodzilla. BeatKing has been the best part of the club for over a decade,” Tasha Felder shared on Instagram. “He has produced and worked with so many artists, that his sound will forever live.
“He loved his daughters @clubgodparenting, his music and his fans,” Felder’s statement continued. “We will love him forever.”
Felder told TMZ that BeatKing, whose real name was Justin Riley, died in a Houston hospital after suffering a pulmonary embolism.
BeatKing had been participating in a morning takeover at the Urban One/Radio One station Thursday when he fainted and was rushed to a nearby medical center. He died later that day with his two daughters, Jayla and Kayla, by his side.
“It is truly sad, we loved him so much,” Felder added.
The rapper most recently appeared during Nicki Minaj’s tour stop at the Toyota Center in May.
UnderGround Kingz member Bun B paid tribute to BeatKing on Instagram, writing that he was “a great spirited person” and “we lost a talented artist and father.”
BeatKing rose to fame with his 2010 album, “Kings of the Club,” but really took off when his 2020 track “Then Leave” became a viral hit on TikTok and Houston radio stations.
His other songs include “SDAB” featuring 2 Chainz and Juicy J, “Outside,” “Keep It Poppin” featuring Ludacris and “Queendom Come.”
BeatKing was recently photographed hanging out with Drake, but it is unknown whether they had any plans to collaborate.
