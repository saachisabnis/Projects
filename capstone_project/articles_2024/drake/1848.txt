The rookie quarterbacks are on display this morning
As we wait for the San Francisco 49ers to kick off this afternoon, the morning slate features a few games that are expected to have lopsided outcomes. The Kansas City Chiefs are on the road after losing to the Buffalo Bills. Patrick Mahomes takes on Bryce Young and the Carolina Panthers.
The Minnesota Vikings and Sam Darnold are on the road against the Chicago Bears. Caleb Williams came close to taking down the Packers last week. Can he do it against the Vikes?
The Detroit Lions are coming off a game where they scored on every possession. They travel to Indianapolis to face Anthony Richardson and the Colts. If there was ever a spot where Detroit would come out flat, itâ€™s today.
Mike McDaniel hosts the New England Patriots. Drake Maye looks like a star in the making. Another AFC matchup features the Titans and the Texans. The home team is favored by more than a touchdown in both games.
Finally, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers face a Daniel Jones-less New York Giants, while the Dallas Cowboys hope not to get the doors blown off them against Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders.
