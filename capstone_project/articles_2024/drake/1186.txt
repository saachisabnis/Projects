DURANT, Oklahoma (KXII) - As the sun went down, the volume went up in Downtown Durant on Thursday evening when the city’s annual fall concert series drew a large crowd once again.
“I got here just after noon,” Southeastern Oklahoma State University student Emily Kendrick said. “It’s just awesome and we’re gonna have a good, honkytonk time.”
Braxton Keith and Dawson Drake played loud for the downtown crowd on Thursday, but concert goers aren’t the only ones having a good time.
Roadhouse Bar and Grill has served Durant since 1997, and owner Leigh Anne Montgomery said live music just steps off the outdoor patio brings a special kind of energy,
“The morale has been really good, and the concert series has been well received,” she said.
Montgomery said events like the concert series bring in customers at a time of year when business might not be booming.
“Typically in the restaurant industry, October is a little bit rough because we have back to school in September,” she said. “But because of the concert series, our sales are up on Thursday nights, so we’re really grateful.”
Grace Rudolph with Discover Durant said it’s all about bringing both locals and tourists out to create a sense of togetherness downtown.
“We want people to feel at home here,” she said. “We want them to be a part of our community anytime they come in.”
There’s one more concert in this year’s series. Neal McCoy and Billie Jo Jones will wrap it all up next Thursday.
Gates open at 6 p.m., and the artists take the stage starting at 7 p.m. The event is free for everyone.
