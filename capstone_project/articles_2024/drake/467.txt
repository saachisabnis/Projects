KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — Three teenagers were arrested after they were found with handguns during a traffic stop in Kalamazoo on Thursday.
Around 12:30 p.m., officers with the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety pulled over a vehicle in the area of S. Drake Road and Stonebrook Avenue.
During the stop, three handguns were found and three teenagers, ages 16, 16 and 14, were arrested. KDPS said that they were identified through tips submitted via Silent Observer. They are being held in the Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home and are facing charges of carrying concealed weapons.
“This case is a testament to what can be accomplished when the community and law enforcement work hand in hand,” Deputy Chief Matthew Huber said in a release. “Thanks to those who came forward, we’ve taken dangerous weapons off the streets and made Kalamazoo safer for everyone.”
