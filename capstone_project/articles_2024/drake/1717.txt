There’s nothing like a Tuesday morning diss track? Just after 9 a.m. in Los Angeles, California, Kendrick Lamar elected to release “Euphoria,” a direct response to Drake’s back-to-back releases, “Taylor Made Freestyle” and “Push Ups.” The nearly seven minute track finds the Compton native repeatedly taking shots at Drake’s identity, parenting, musical style and much more. At one point, he flat out says he just doesn’t enjoy what Drake represents.
“I hate the way that you walk, way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress,” he raps.
The latest release from Kendrick Lamar also takes listeners backstage and into their relationship, which dates back nearly 15 years. Most recently, the pgLang captain alleges Drake sent a cease and desist regarding Lamar’s “Like That” verse and asked him to collaborate on a song called “Euphoria.”
“Cease and desist on the ‘Like That’ record? What you don’t like that record?” he asked.
“Surprised you wanted that feature request, know that we got some s—t to address,” he adds.
To dismiss any notion that the track may have been generated by artificial intelligence, Kendrick Lamar shared the track via YouTube, prompting his former label mate Jay Rock to chime in as well.
“Now, this ain’t no AI. See I know K Dot,” he tweeted.
“N—a got fried like a nice golden brown wing. [He] dropped that n—a in that grease for [six] mins 40 something [seconds]! [He] fried [him].”
Drake has not issued a comment regarding the matter, but given his social media activity in the past, it is likely that we’ll hear from the Toronto area native sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out “Euphoria” below.
