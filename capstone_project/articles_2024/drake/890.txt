Drake is reportedly taking legal action against Universal Music Group and Spotify due to ongoing negotiations with his record label, according to Loren Lorosa. On social media, she shared that sources close to Drake believe UMG is trying to overshadow him by promoting Kendrick Lamar's hit song "Not Like Us." Lorosa stated that Drake's lawsuit is about more than just this song; it involves his concerns about UMG not supporting him during sensitive contract talks. He feels UMG is using his earnings to promote Kendrick's track, which could hurt his standing while he seeks a new deal. Drake believes that if he were treated like Taylor Swift, many of these issues wouldn't have occurred. He filed his petition in a Manhattan court, claiming that UMG and Spotify collaborated to boost the popularity of "Not Like Us" using dishonest tactics like bots and payola. His lawyers argued that UMG intentionally created a scheme to manipulate streaming and radio. The case also claims that UMG broke the RICO Act, engaged in misleading business practices, and used false advertising. This lawsuit is gaining attention online amid the ongoing tension between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
