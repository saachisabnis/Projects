Mike Dussault, Patriots.com: A powerful run blocker in the mold of Michael Onwenu, this was an interesting move after taking two guards and a center last season. Robinson provides some competition for any uncertainty that might arise where Cole Strange and Sidy Sow are projected as the current starters.
Evan Lazar, Patriots.com: The #Patriots select Texas A&M guard Layden Robinson. Wide-body, powerful interior O-Line prospect who has mostly played right guard for the Aggies.
New England took three IOL on day three last year. Add another one to Cole Strange, Sidy Sow, Jake Andrews, and Atonio Mafi.

Tamara Brown, Patriots.com: The Patriots invested in a QB in the first round and have continued to draft guys to develop alongside him on offense. Robinson is a bully and great for ground and pound football. Was a bulldozer for the Aggies who created space for the RBs to skate past defenders.

Mark Daniels, Masslive: You wonder what it says about how the Patriots feel about Cole Strange (who was hurt last year), Sidy Sow and Atonio Mafi when they draft another guard in the fourth

Jerry Thornton, Barstool Sports: It's G Layden Robinson with the 103rd pick. This might be heresy since it's not the way Belichick did it, but I for one am ecstatic about the Pats drafting for need for once

Jordan Schultz, Bleacher Report: Eliot Wolf already making it a huge priority to protect Drake Maye. Layden Robinson in the 4th round, Caedan Wallace in the 3rd.

Cole Strange
Chasen Hines
Jake Andrews
Sidy Sow
Atonio Mafi

Some also believe Caedan Wallace eventually will be a guard.

                WR
              

Mike Dussault, Patriots.com: For Baker: A big board and mock draft hit for me, Baker is another tough receiver and one who excels with the ball in his hands. He had multiple big plays for UCF and spent time at Alabama which shows he had a solid pedigree. Combined with Polk, the Patriots have added two intriguing receivers to a now loaded depth chart that runs 12 players deep.
Evan Lazar, Patriots.com: Two ball-winners for the #Patriots in Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker to pair with Drake Maye.

Tamara Brown, Patriots.com: Ready to grab my popcorn and watch Javon Baker bake at Gillette Stadium. Love the way he can adjust his speed to create separation, has great poise on down field throws and excellent body control.

Connor Rogers, NBC Sports: #Patriots wisely double up at WR by now adding Javon Baker (78th overall on my board)
Consistent deep threat despite not being a sub 4.5 forty runner
Body control, tracking, understands positioning in contested situations
I saw him as a future no. 3

Phil Perry, NBC Sports Boston: Interesting comp for Javon Baker from @SteveSmithSr89 earlier in the draft process: former Patriots wideout Brandon Lloyd.
Baker has shown he has the ability to make some really acrobatic catches along the boundary, which was Lloyd's calling card throughout his career.

Mike Dussault, Patriots.com: The Patriots finally took a defensive player in the sixth round tabbing a ball hocking cornerback from the SEC. Cornerback is a sneaky need for the team and he should have plenty of opportunities to compete for a job both on defense and on special teams.
Evan Lazar, Patriots.com: The #Patriots make their first defensive selection in the draft: South Carolina CB Marcellas Dial. Dial is a developmental man coverage corner. Has the size (5-11, 190) and speed (4.46) to play on the outside.

Mark Daniels, Masslive: The Patriots first defensive player drafted, Marcellas Dial, is a 5-foot-11 ballhawk of a cornerback. He led South Carolina in PBUs in each of the last two seasons. He had 31 pass breakups over three seasons.
The Patriots needed more cornerback depth and get it
Mike Reiss, ESPN: The Patriots select South Carolina CB Marcellas Dial with their sixth-round pick (No. 180):

Phil Perry, NBC Sports Boston: Patriots add a corner.
Dial is 6-0, 190. Explosive vertical (40.5", 91st %ile) and broad (10-9, 87th %ile).
Key phrase in The Beast guide from @dpbrugler: "Plays with sensitive trigger to quickly unlock and go."
Patriots *love* DBs with feet that allow for snappy transitions.

🏈 43 games, 21 starts
🏈 400-of-650 for 5,353 yards 37 TD, 11 INT
🏈 In @dpbrugler scouting report, a suggestion he could be TE conversion

Phil Perry, NBC Sports Boston: Drafting two quarterbacks in the same class screams Packers philosophy from Eliot Wolf. Late-round dart throw. If the NE staff believes it can harness some of what Joe Milton brings to the table from a physical standpoint, he's an asset. Either to them or someone else.

Wasn't crazy about him early on day three, which is where some of the projections had him. But this is great value.

New England Football Journal: Jaheim Bell is an undersized move tight end who can play the U and move around in formations. Can block back and seal on inside zone. Vertical threat who can stretch the middle of the field and create match ups. He is a player the Patriots staff liked because of his versatility. #PatsDraft
