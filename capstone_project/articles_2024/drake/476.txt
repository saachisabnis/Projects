Drake has attempted to reassert his dominance in the rap game amid the ongoing drama involving Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole.
Hip Hop’s “Big Three” have been at the center of the conversation lately thanks to Kendrick dissing both Drizzy and Cole on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.”

Cole then fired back on “7 Minute Drill” before controversially retracting his diss song and apologizing to the Compton rapper on stage at Dreamville Festival.
While Drake has yet to directly address Kendrick’s lyrical darts, he has issued what appears to be another oblique response by flexing some of his achievements on social media.

Posting on his Instagram Stories on Tuesday (April 9), Drizzy uploaded a picture of two Billboard Music Awards that he won in 2023 for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Album, with both prizes shared with 21 Savage.
“@21savage wipe down,” he captioned the image.
As rap fans eagerly await an official response from Drake, Kendrick Lamar’s “Like That” verse is alleged to have complicated the 6 God’s relationship with J. Cole.
On the latest episode of the New Rory & Mal podcast, Mal claimed that Drizzy told him he had concerns about joining Cole on stage at this past weekend’s Dreamville Festival due to “7 Minute Drill.”

“He might get mad at me for talking about but he knows he’s my n-gga. I asked Drake one question. I said, ‘Yo, you going to Dream Fest this weekend?’” the podcaster said.
“And he gave me an answer that was kind of weird Friday night hearing it, but Sunday night it made all the sense in the world. He says, ‘I don’t know, should I? ‘Cause it’s weird right now. Are we performing the record? Can we ever perform ‘First Person Shooter’?’”

Mal continued to relay Drake’s response, seemingly in his own words: “He has to change the bar now. He has to shit on Kendrick now. So we gonna shit on Kendrick every time we do the record? Nobody wants to hear us together unless we dissing Kendrick.”
The comments referenced Cole’s lyrics on “First Person Shooter” where he praises Kendrick: “Love when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K. Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali.”

Meanwhile, some believe that Drake is preparing a lyrical response to Kendrick Lamar, who he previously collaborated with on songs such as “Marvin’s Room” and “Fucking Problems” along with A$AP Rocky and 2 Chainz.
Last weekend, the Toronto rap star shared a photo on his Instagram Stories that showed the inside of what appeared to be a sports locker room.

On a bench was the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy (given each year to the winner of the NBA Finals), next to a notebook and a pen, seemingly indicating that Drake was preparing some prize-winning rhymes.
