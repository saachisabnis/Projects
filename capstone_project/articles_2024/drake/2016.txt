Drake is no stranger to having lookalikes. However, using bars from “Not Like Us” to comment on their posts on Instagram is a bit new.
Over the weekend, Drake posted a clip of one of his fakes performing “Hotline Bling.” On his Instagram Story, he wrote, “Sometimes you gotta pop out,” a nod to the “Not Like Us” diss track aimed at him.
It’s good to see he takes the beef in stride.

Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” remains #1 on YouTube’s US Top Songs and ranks #3 on Global Top Songs. Boosted by a recently released video, the track garnered over 34.2 million global views during the charting period. Lamar’s song “Euphoria” is also at #45, and he ranks #2 on US Top Artists.
Just last week, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” surged back to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart following the July 4 premiere of its official video. The track marks its second week at the top, after debuting at No. 1 nine weeks earlier.
The song, released under pgLang/Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope/ICLG, has solidified its place in pop culture, maintaining positions between Nos. 2 and 6 for eight weeks, including the last two at No. 3. Lamar achieves his first multi-week Hot 100 No. 1 as a solo artist, having previously led for a week in 2017 with “Humble.”
“Not Like Us” boasts 53.8 million official streams (up 20%), 40 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 9%), and 8,000 units sold (up 16%) in the U.S. from July 5-11. This marks the song’s fifth week with over 50 million weekly streams, a 2024 record.
In addition, the track ascends 2-1 on the Streaming Songs chart, 6-4 on Digital Song Sales, and reaches a new peak at 10-9 on Radio Songs.
