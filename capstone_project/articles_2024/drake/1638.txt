Drake is gearing up for another major collaboration, this time with Lil Durk, and fans got a taste of what’s to come on September 4th when streamer Adin Ross previewed their new track. The song, titled “Discontinuing Wockhardt,” references Wockhardt, a brand of prescription cough syrup that contains codeine and is commonly misused to make lean.

The track opens with Lil Durk before Drake joins in, delivering his signature melodic flow. In his verse, Drake reflects on the changing availability of certain brands of lean, singing, “What seal do I pop now? You know that the Act’ gone, I can’t get no Wok now.” This isn’t Drake’s first time addressing his experience with lean. In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, he admitted to using it but stressed that he does so in moderation. “Have I sipped codeine before? Yeah, of course. Have I smoked weed? Yes. Do I drink wine? Yes. But do I do it excessively? No. I’m not a reckless guy. I do it all within moderation,” he stated.
Lil Durk, Drake’s collaborator on this track, has also spoken out about his past struggles with lean. In June, Durk revealed that he had gone to rehab to kick his addiction to codeine and Xanax. “It was tough at first, but it ain’t that tough ’cause I really knew what I wanted,” Durk said of his recovery process. “I wanted better. I want to be a better man, a better father, a better leader.”
As both artists reflect on their experiences with drugs, “Discontinuing Wockhardt” offers fans a deeper glimpse into their personal journeys and growth.
