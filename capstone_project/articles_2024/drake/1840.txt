In a season increasingly defined by high-profile rap feuds, rapper BIA released her diss track titled “SUE MEEE?” Sunday alleging Cardi B cheated on her husband Offset—which Offset has denied—days after Cardi B seemingly threw shots at the “WHOLE LOTTA MONEY” rapper in a new remix that dropped Friday.

Megan Thee Stallion and Glorilla released the remix to their song “Wanna Be” on Friday that features Cardi B, and fans on social media have claimed Cardi B appears to be throwing shots at Massachusetts rapper BIA .
Several of her lyrics on “Wanna Be (Remix)” seem to be aimed at BIA, including lines like “Thought she was on the shelf, IKEA/ Hope she talk like that when I see her/ B— please, don’t nobody wanna be ya,” which some have pointed out sounds like “Please, don’t nobody wanna BIA,” a play on the rapper’s name.“
“Guess I’m a teacher since she wanna sub me,” Cardi B rapped, which may be in reference to BIA rapping “How you say you runnin’ down but you can’t walk on the beat” on a song back in April, an alleged dig at Cardi B, who admitted she wanted to hop on a remix to Ice Spice’s hit song “Munch,” but didn’t because she couldn’t sync her rap with the song’s unique beat.
Shortly after “Wanna Be (Remix)” was released, BIA posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, “B—- IS WACK. B—-IS TRASH. I SHOULD HANG B—- RIGHT OVER MY KNEE, THE WAY I BE PUTTIN MY BELT TO THEY A–,” which is seemingly a play on a Cardi B lyric from her joint song “Clout” with husband Offset.
BIA also posted a viral video—with the “Wanna Be” instrumental superimposed in the background—of a battle rapper reciting a line that fell flat, leaving people in the audience confused.

BIA released her diss track “SUE MEEE?” on YouTube Sunday alleging Cardi B cheated on husband Offset: “Put it on your hubby since you like lying on your vows,” she raps. The cover art for the song is a screenshot of an Instagram story post made by Offset in 2023 that appeared to suggest Cardi B had cheated on him. Offset quickly deleted the story and explained later that year Cardi B didn’t actually cheat on him, and he only posted it because “She get crazy at the mouth a little bit, and I was really lit that night.” BIA also accused Cardi B of having a ghostwriter, rapping “Do I beef with you or do I beef with Pardi?” Pardison Fontaine is a rapper and songwriter who has writing credits—under his real name Jordan Kyle Lanier Thorpe—on several of Cardi B’s songs including “Bodak Yellow” and “Be Careful,” and has worked with other artists like Ye and ex girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion. However, Cardi B previously played a snippet of BIA’s diss track on Instagram Live Saturday before BIA posted her own snippet and threatened to sue BIA for reportedly lying about cheating on Offset. During this live, Cardi B also played a recording of a call between the two rappers where BIA accused the “Bodak Yellow” rapper of copying her sound.
BIA has worked with rapper Nicki Minaj—who Cardi B has previously beefed with—several times in the past, and Minaj recently brought BIA out during her “Pink Friday 2 World Tour” to perform the pair’s song “WHOLE LOTTA MONEY (Remix).” However, BIA and Cardi B’s rap beef seemingly began last year when BIA addressed rumors there had been hard feelings between the two. “I didn’t switch up on anybody because I don’t know Cardi in real life,” BIA said during an Instagram live in March 2023. “I’ve never met Cardi, we’ve never had a conversation. I don’t have no issues with her. It’s all love, but I don’t know her.” The pair has since traded shots back and forth, which came to a boiling point earlier this year when Cardi B released her “Like What” freestyle in March sampling Missy Elliot’s “She’s A B—-.” Fans claimed Cardi B was imitating BIA, who also sampled Elliot’s song in 2023, and BIA responded to the claims on X with: “🥴🥴🥴.” Cardi B made a post on X later that day saying “B—- make a fool of themselves every single time .. ima show ya something when I release this song tho.”
Eminem took shots at Megan The Stallion on “Houdini,” a new song that was also released Friday. “If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me, would I really have a shot at a feat,” Eminem rapped. The line may be a joke about Megan Thee Stallion getting shot in the foot by rapper Tory Lanez, who he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Some have pointed out a line from the Houston rapper’s record “HISS,” which was released earlier this year, may have sparked Eminem’s jab. “I feel like Mariah Carey/ Got these b—- so obsessed,” Megan Thee Stallion rapped. (Carey’s “Obsessed” was released in 2009, and was a diss record aimed at Eminem, whom she previously dated.) Others have come to Eminem’s defense, saying he rapped in character as Slim Shady—his more aggressive alter-ego—claiming Eminem himself didn’t diss Megan Thee Stallion. Though she has yet to respond to Eminem, Megan Thee Stallion previously slammed rapper Drake for joking about her getting shot by rapping “this b— lie ‘bout getting shots, but she still a stallion,” in his 2022 song “Circo Loco.” In a response on X, Megan The Stallion said “Since when tf is it cool to joke abt women getting shot?”
No. 11. That’s the spot the original version of “Wanna Be” peaked at on the Billboard Hot 100. It’s been on the charts for seven weeks, and now sits at No. 50 on the list.
