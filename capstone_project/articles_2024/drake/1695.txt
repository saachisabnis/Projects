Here's a quick rundown of all the important plays and players from the New England Patriots preseason-ending loss to the Washington Commanders. Mike Dussault 
The Patriots wrapped up the 2024 preseason with a penalty-laden slog against the Washington Commanders that capped off their summer record at 1-2. The Commanders prevailed 20-10, scoring all 20 of their points in the second half, as one Drake Maye-led scoring drive in the first quarter and a Chad Ryland field goal in the third quarter weren't enough to get New England a win.
The Patriots backup defenders struggled to stop former Patriot teammate Trace McSorley, who threw for 125 yards and added 40 rushing yards, giving Washington a come-from-behind preseason victory.
With cutdown day looming, a handful of lesser-known Patriots made favorable impressions while the team's offensive line turned in a concerning performance that included seven first-half penalties and an injury to one of their starters.
There were things to build off of and things that will need to be cleaned up before the team opens their 2024 regular season slate in Cincinnati in just under two weeks.
Here's a rundown of all the standout plays and players that defined the game!
1. Briefly Brissett
Jacoby Brissett played just one series and was banged up on a sack, a potentially significant development that will be heavily monitored over the next two weeks. Despite the brief appearance, Brissett had a nice third-down conversion as Washington sent a blitz and the quarterback was able to unload the ball to running back Antonio Gibson, who slipped out of the backfield and picked up the conversion.
Brissett nearly had another big play that K.J. Osborn couldn't corral, while Antonio Gibson ran hard with 17 rushing yards on three carries to go with 13 yards from his third-down catch. Rhamondre Stevenson was among the key starters who got the night off, along with Ja'Whaun Bentley, Jonathan Jones and David Andrews among others.
Brissett was shown by NBC cameras on the sideline following his series and he didn't look any worse for wear. That could be a positive sign that he avoided anything serious. He was officially announced as questionable to return with a right shoulder injury.
2. Maye Throws First TD, OL struggles
After a Commanders punt, Drake Maye put together a scoring drive, going 88 yards in 11 plays and finishing off the drive with a throw to Kevin Harris that Harris dove into the end zone with after breaking a tackle.
Maye flashes his arm and athleticism on the drive, first rushing for a first down on 3rd-and-14, then a 29-yard strike to Ja'Lynn Polk, and a 16-yard pass to DeMario Douglas on 3rd-and-8. The operation was sloppy at times with two botched snaps, Maye showed his ability to avoid trouble, keep his eyes downfield and make plays.
The drive was another building block for the young quarterback as he handled some negative plays and led the team on an extended scoring drive.
Maye's second drive wasn't as productive, with JaMychal Hasty picking up 22 yards on a catch and carry, but two penalties (one declined) and a screen pass to Douglas that was blown up in the backfield helped force a Patriots punt.
Maye's third and fourth drives were even worse, with two three-and-outs and three more penalties on the offensive line (one declined). That brought the total, including declined penalties, to five on the offensive line in five possessions. Patriots offensive linemen were getting pushed into the backfield too frequently and there weren't many clean pockets for Maye to work out of. They even stepped on Maye's foot once, pulling off his shoe and forcing him to throw a pass while planting in a sock.
Poor play up front hurt the Patriots offensive chances to get anything going after Maye's first scoring drive and considering it was four of the current five starters going against Washington's backup defenders, it was a disconcerting performance.
3. Maye Almost Delivers Two-Minute Score
After three sputtering drives, Maye got one final chance in the first half, taking the field with 1:25 left to try and lead the team to a score. Despite continued penalties on the offensive line, including a holding call on Michael Jordan and a third illegal formation penalty on Okorafor, Maye again delivered some impressive throws that at least gave his team a shot at a long-range field goal before the half.
Javon Baker grabbed a 16-yard comeback, while Ja'Lynn Polk (13 yards) and K.J. Osborn (48-yard touchdown) both had big plays wiped out by the penalties. Osborn's nullified touchdown was a notable play from Maye as he bought time with his feet and threw a downfield strike on the run to Osborn which would've been his second touchdown throw of the game, if not for the team's fourth illegal formation on the night.
It wasn't quite complete, but it was a solid bookend drive that showed Maye's continued progress, providing more valuable experience for him to grow from. Maye finished 13-of-20 for 126 yards and a touchdown in five drives.
4. Roster Battle Standouts
Joe Milton and many of the Patriots backups entered the game in the second half as it began to feel like an old-fashioned fourth preseason game. Here are some of the standouts from the game that were looking to solidify their roster spots.
 Joe Giles-Harris came up with an interception, while fellow linebacker Christian Ellis led the team with double-digit tackles. However, both were banged up during the contest, complicating their outlook. Elliss was ruled out with a head injury in the fourth quarter. Marcellas Dial had a nice pass breakup on a third-quarter third down. He remains in the mix at cornerback, along with Alex Austin who had a pass defense of his own. Joe Milton's 20-yard scramble helped set up a 38-yard field goal by Chad Ryland, as the second-year kicker answered Joey Slye's extra point. Milton also hit Kawaan Baker for a 12-yard completion on the drive. JaMycal Hasty ran hard and showed up with four carries for 21 yards and three catches for 24 yards. He's come on lately and should have earned a backfield role behind Stevenson and Gibson. Kevin Harris' touchdown helped his cause as well. That should be the team's foursome. Receiver Matt Landers just arrived last week but gave a stagnant backup offense a boost with a 34-yard reception from Joe Milton. Landers has size and speed. Terrell Jennings put up a 13-yard run in the fourth quarter that secured his spot as the team's leading rusher on the night (six carries, 36 yards). Jennings has been buried on the depth chart but has made the most of his limited chances. He ran hard once again. 5. Cutdown Day Coming
There won't be much time or need to break down the loss, as NFL teams must whittle their rosters down to 53 players by Tuesday at 4 pm EST.
Injuries to Brissett and Sidy Sow (ruled out, ankle) will be pieces to monitor and could affect the team's decisions, with backup guards like Michael Jordan and Atonio Mafi, and backup quarterback Bailey Zappe potentially directly impacted.
Maye's performance was another encouraging step, but this could be the last time we see him until later this season. Issues with the offensive line continue to be a primary concern and now there are additional injury concerns to contemplate at the beleaguered position group.
Otherwise, the Patriots are scheduled to practice on Wednesday and Thursday before getting a three-day break over Labor Day Weekend. Then it will be full steam ahead on the Cincinnati Bengals and the 2024 campaign.
