"How would you take my name and not have the decency to ask me?"

	It is widely known that Rick Ross got his name from infamous drug lord Freeway Ricky Ross, and according to Ricky, Rozay has never admitted it. 

	Freeway recently dished on the 48-year-old rapper and his issues with the lack of acknowledgment during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. 

	The controversial podcast host ‘asked the Terrell, TX native if he had ever seen someone confront the “Aston Martin Music” artist about him. “Not in person, no,” he responded. “Anytime I’m around, he disappears.” Rogan seemed very thrown off by Ross parading around using the man’s name, but Freeway remained calm with every response.

	“Well you know, these guys […] when you got some money, they don’t care if you’re beating women or making ’em lick tampons. Everybody f**k with you, so he was on top of the world at one time,” Freeway said. The UFC commentator brought up Ross’ past as a correctional officer and Freeway explained why that hasn’t hurt his reputation, either. “Yeah, he was, but when he got some money, they forget he was a correctional officer,” he asserted. “You got gangsters doing records with him and ‘Oh I hate snitches’ and all this, but they’re doing records with a police officer who put handcuffs [on people].”

	Freeway Ricky Ross continued, speaking about letters he received from inmates who were in jail while Rick Ross was a correctional officer. “They told me what a sh*tty guy he was,” Freeway said. “They would be shooting dice, he would take the dice and all the money. They got extra soup, he’d take the soups. […] Everybody in jail got extra soups and you save your soups because there might come a time that you ain’t got ’em so you stack your stuff up but most officers don’t even care.”

	










	Rogan seemingly couldn’t get past the name usage of it all; “If there was a rapper out there named Joe Rogan, I’d go ‘What the f**k?'” Freeway expressed that he took issue with the lack of permission and credit given to him. “How would you take my name and not have the decency to ask me?” he asked. “First of all, you should’ve asked but then never pay homage? He won’t even admit that he stole the name. He tells people that he invented the name. Like, how the f**k do you invent the name?”

	Rogan was bewildered, considering the fact Freeway was famous and many people knew who he was. The drug lord countered saying that Ross’ luxurious lifestyle made it easy for people to forget or look past it. Watch the full interview below.

	Rick Ross’ past as a correctional officer came up recently when he feuded with longtime collaborator Drake. The 6 God dedicated two tracks, “Push Ups” and “Family Matters,” to all of the opponents he was combating. 

	










	“What the f**k I heard Rick drop, ni**a? Talkin’ somethin’ ’bout a nose job, ni**a/ Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y’all ni**as/ Put a ni**a in the bars, let a ni**a rot, kind of like your old job, ni**a/ House sittin’ on some land, but it’s out where no one even really know y’all ni**as/ Bi**hes gotta drive two hours ‘fore you pay ’em just to give a blowjob, ni**a,” Drizzy rapped on “Family Matters.”
