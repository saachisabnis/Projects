Growing up, whenever an “Indiana Jones” movie popped up on TV, my dad and I would drop everything and settle in to watch. So, if you’d told my younger self that one day I’d be reviewing a video game set in the same universe, I’d probably have choked on my popcorn.
Fast forward to today, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is here, promising to capture that same sense of daring adventure we’ve all come to love. And you know what? It mostly delivers. While it doesn’t rewrite the rulebook, it leans into what makes Indy, well, Indy: exciting exploration and that delightfully over-the-top combat.
Sure, the gameplay isn’t without its bumps. Some edges are a bit rough, but the game’s heart is in the right place. From pummeling enemies with those classic old-school punches to sprinting away from the iconic rolling boulder in the opening sequence, it feels like stepping into the movies themselves. And yes, Dr. Jones is decked out in full gear, whip, hat, and all — because anything less wouldn’t be Indy.
Read on for my full Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review, where I’ll take you through why this game is worth your money and time (because no one wants to waste both).
I have to start with the story because it’s easily the strongest aspect of the game. As someone who loves a narrative that knows how to balance fun with intrigue, I was fully on board with where Indiana Jones and the Great Circle took me.
Set in 1937, between “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “The Last Crusade”, The Golden Circle follows Indiana Jones (voiced by the incredible Troy Baker) as he races to stop rival factions from exploiting a mysterious power linked to the titular McGuffin — a network of enigmatic sites that, when mapped, form a perfect circle around the globe. The adventure takes players across various real-world locations, including Rome, Thailand, Egypt, Shanghai, and the Himalayas.
After the lackluster reception of the last two “Indiana Jones” movies, I was relieved to see the game returning to the franchise’s roots. With my notoriously short attention span, I’m always grateful for a game that doesn’t waste time getting to the good stuff. From familiar settings like Marshall College where the story begins with an intriguing break-in, to an action-packed opening sequence (no spoilers, but expect some familiar faces), the game launches you into a grand adventure.
But there was one annoyance, and that’s a minor issue with the cutscenes — I encountered an irritating stuttering effect that really took me out of the story. This was especially frustrating as cutscenes are meant to immerse you in the narrative and it was a distraction during key story moments. I tried adjusting my settings to fix it, but no matter what, it didn’t improve much.
After a brief period of console exclusivity on Xbox Series X/S, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is now available on PS5, and it remains one of the most enjoyable action-adventure games of this current gaming generation. The full game has been ported over to PlayStation with all the adventure, excitement and whip-cracking brawls intact. The PS5’s DualSense controller has been put to good use, making each punch thrown feel even more impactful, and on the pricey PS5 Pro, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the most visually stunning games I’ve ever played. I thought it was a must-play last year on Xbox/PC, and just a few months later, it remains very much one of the most authentic licensed games you can play anywhere. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle throws you straight into the action with its first-person perspective, which I’m usually not a fan of. However, I have to admit, it works here. From the very beginning, you're plunged into the heart of the adventure without a wasted second.
One of the best parts of the game though is the iconic whip. At first, I thought it was just an accessory thrown in to make the game feel more like the movies, but that’s not the case. It's been fully integrated into the experience. Whether you're swinging across gaps, climbing walls or pulling enemies toward you in combat, the whip is an essential tool. The fact that it’s so integral to Indy’s journey is a nice touch that really helps make the game feel true to the character.
That said, climbing and navigating through some areas can feel clunky. Indy isn’t exactly the most graceful when scaling walls or dropping off ledges. If you’re hoping for the fluid acrobatics of Lara Croft or Nathan Drake while going from building to building, you might be disappointed — Indy’s not quite as nimble (though I suppose that’s part of his charm). The stiff movement is only a minor issue, but it can break the flow, especially when you’re trying to avoid being detected by patrolling soldiers.
There’s this one scene where you have to sneak through a restricted area in Vatican City. As I was swinging across a wall with my whip, Indy’s head suddenly got in the way due to his awkward movements, throwing me off completely. I plummeted straight to the ground and got spotted by the enemies (so much for being stealthy).
Aside from the awkward climbing and swinging, the game nails the little things. Like turning keys in door locks or manipulating your map. Yes, these are minor mechanics, but they make you feel more connected to the world. You also acquire a camera and a diary to log your quests like a real adventurer. A camera icon will appear on the top of your screen whenever a picture opportunity pops up, and if you manage to take the perfect shot, you’ll earn some “adventure points” which can be spent on dozens of upgrades, like getting a free revive or unlocking the ability to perform a takedown unarmed.
For those who love exploring a good challenge, there are tons of hidden objectives, mini-puzzles, side quests and NPCs to converse with. Some of the puzzles took me a while to figure out, using up more brain cells than I’d care to admit, but that made them satisfying to solve. There’s so much to do in an already-packed game, so it’s safe to say you’ll never get bored (maybe a little lost at times). Naturally, the puzzles begin quite simply, with one of the first tasks being to photograph strange fountains adorned with mysterious symbols.
The only other hiccup I encountered, aside from the dodgy climbing mechanics, was with the inventory menu. I’m pretty picky when it comes to switching between items. I like it to be fast and easy to access. In the heat of a tough situation, navigating the menu can be a bit awkward, and more than once, I found myself accidentally selecting a piece of bread instead of a melee weapon. Needless to say, that didn’t help my stress levels during a fight.
At its core, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle leans into stealth but incorporates elements from immersive action games, giving you multiple ways to approach combat and navigate enemy groups. But of course, the main form of combat is your fists, and you can knock out enemies with that cartoon punching sound known from the movies, which is just great.
It’s pretty simple really, you have to swing left and right, push enemies while they’re recovering, dodge their attacks and even charge up a punch to send them flying. It’s an entertaining combat system I haven’t experienced before.
But you don’t just have to use your fists. You can pick up random objects scattered around the map to stealthily take out an enemy instead. Candles, baseball bats, saucepans, bells… yes really. You can even flip your gun around and use it as a melee weapon. These quirky touches really help capture that classic Indiana Jones feel, and the developers do a fantastic job maintaining its lighthearted, sometimes silly tone.
One of the greatest things about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the flexibility it offers in how you approach combat. You can push enemies off ledges to silently take them out, or even pick up their bodies and move them out of sight to avoid alerting nearby enemies. It’s a great way to play sneakily, especially if you prefer to avoid direct confrontation.
But if you’re feeling bold (which I did), you can always go in guns blazing and take down enemies head-on, with a more chaotic, action-packed approach. One particularly challenging scene took place in an underground tomb, where enemies wielded their own combat weapons and pelted me with rocks whenever I was out of reach. There was no way to safely create a barrier between us, and it's those small details that make the game genuinely fun.
Survival isn’t just about swinging your whip and punching your way through enemies either — it’s also about managing your resources. You’ll need to collect food throughout your adventure to maintain your energy and stamina, which become crucial when running from enemies or engaging in intense hand-to-hand combat.
Whether that be an orange, a piece of bread or some random biscuits you steal from an enemy’s pack. The need for food and stamina management adds to the overall challenge, as you balance fighting and exploring while ensuring you don’t run out of energy when you need it most.
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle offers a fun, action-packed adventure that stays true to the spirit of the franchise while delivering a fresh experience. For completionists, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle offers a relatively lengthy experience, with around 30 hours for a single playthrough if you’re determined to uncover every secret.
The gameplay offers smooth action for the most part, though some clunky climbing and tricky navigation can interrupt the flow at times. The combat is straightforward yet entertaining, with a mix of stealth, brawling and environmental tactics offering you the freedom to approach encounters as you wish. Personally, playing the game in stealth mode is no fun. Going straight in with those punches is a must.
What I've experienced feels like a true love letter from a development team that clearly understands and respects what makes Indiana Jones so special. They’ve captured the essence of the beloved franchise in ways that make the whole adventure feel authentic.
