Tanks for the memories
With the MLB Draft beginning Sunday night, it is just about time to close the book on Tommy White’s LSU career. Despite only being a Tiger for two of his three collegiate seasons, he is unquestionably an LSU legend. He did many things well on the diamond, but we will remember him for his special ability to do one thing in particular:
Hit the baseball really freaking far.
He already earned the Tommy Tanks nickname before the transfer portal dropped him into Baton Rouge, so naturally the expectations were gargantuan. Two 24-homer seasons and a championship ring later, consider those expectations met. He hit so many home runs that aside from a few notable ones, they all run together...
Which is why I’m going to give each one the individual recognition they deserve by ranking all 48!
How were they ranked? Mostly by context. You’ll notice the ones at the bottom are all from games LSU lost. Doesn’t mean the homer was lame, it’s just not as sweet or cool as the ones at the top. But I did my best to give each one a special shoutout for something.
And yeah, we all know what No. 1 is. Don’t be snarky, just read the list and enjoy it.
48. 2-run homer at Mississippi State (3/15/24)
Mr. Tanks Strikes  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/D0uA2234Du
Now I love me a first-pitch homer. First pitch swinging gets a bad rap, yeah I said it. As cool as this swing was, LSU disappeared right after and lost 10-4. A terrible way to kick off SEC play that foreshadowed how the first five weeks of the conference slate would go.
47. 2-run homer at Missouri (4/20/24)
This one is frustrating because it cut a three-run deficit to one in the ninth, but Mizzou got the last two outs to put it away anyway. LSU still won the series and also won a gymnastics championship earlier that day, so it’s all fine!
46. 2-run homer at Tennessee (4/14/24)
Temporarily brought LSU closer, but the Tigers still suffered a sweep against the Vols. Crazy fact: Tommy White played nine games against Tennessee in his two years and this was his only homer. 
45. Solo homer at Arkansas (3/28/24)
Man I hate losing to Arkansas.
44. Solo homer at Arkansas (3/30/24)
Damn they swept us? They got a hell of a team. Surely they finally made that deep run in Omaha this year.
43. Solo homer vs Vanderbilt (4/5/24)
You know what’s crazier than blowing a home game where Tommy White hits a homer?
42. 2-run homer vs Vanderbilt (4/5/24)
Blowing a home game where Tommy White hits two homers!
41. 2-run homer at Mississippi State (3/17/24)
TOMMY. TANKS.@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/RMx5kZFb6B
While LSU did lose its opening series of 2024 SEC play, Tommy homered in all three games. I gotta give him props for this one because he was truly willing us back into it. But we would’ve needed nine Tommy Whites to outhit what our bullpen was allowing on this day.
40. 2-run homer at UGA (5/20/23)
ANOTHER one to Right Field Tommy HR Counter: 20 @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/HYguI0JVgI
Hey remember the 2023 season? Man that was fun. This loss really stung at the time because we blew a chance at the SEC regular season title by dropping this game. But I suppose I can live with how the season worked out in the end.
39. Three-run homer vs Kentucky (4/14/23)
Another loss that didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, but was torturous in the moment. This swing put the Tigers up 6-2, but they ended up losing 13-10. LSU would face the Wildcats again in the Super Regional two months later. I wonder if any swings from that game will make this list.
38. Solo homer vs Nicholls (4/23/24)
Thomas The Tank Engine  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/S3t9IpI9A1
Cou- could it be?? Yes is it! A game LSU actually won! Tommy hit another one later in this game and you’re gonna see it much further down the list because it is much funnier. 
37. 2-run homer vs Grambling (4/30/24)
It’s a good thing Tommy hit this homer. Otherwise LSU would’ve scored 24 runs in this game instead of 26.
36. 2-run homer vs Southeastern (3/26/24)
Be honest, if you didn’t know him as a baseball superstar you would totally believe Tommy White was from Hammond just by looking at him. 
35. Solo homer vs Louisiana Tech (3/19/24)
This put LSU within one run of a run-rule victory. Two innings later Tommy doubled to make the run-rule official. 
34. 2-run homer at Southeastern (5/2/23)
Y’all remember like 30 minutes before this game ESPN+ was like “yeah sorry we can’t stream this game tonight. Too bad!” That was wack. Shoutout to local TV for video evidence this homer happened!
33. 3-run homer vs Samford (3/11/23)
LSU won this game 12-0. The 12 runs came on five swings, all homers. 2023 was a video game.
32. Solo homer vs Northwestern St (5/9/23)
Clutch hit to erase a 1-0 deficit in the second inning. That could’ve gotten out of hand.
31. 3-run homer vs Nicholls (4/4/23)
This was coming off the back to back series wins vs Arkansas and Tennessee. I thought we’d never lose again.
30. 2-run homer vs Nicholls (4/4/23)
Hey this must be a typo. I already said Tommy hit a homer vs Nicholls on April 4, 2023!
29. 3-run homer vs UNO (3/14/23)
Hey remember that time LSU and UNO were both scoreless going into the bottom of the 5th inning? However many runs you think LSU scored in the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th innings of this game, it’s more.
28. Grand slam vs Samford (3/12/23)
Our first granny! LSU entered the 7th inning up 4-1 and ended up walking off a 12-run rule. I miss that team so much.
27. 3-run homer vs Lamar (3/8/23)
Winning decisively over Lamar? Drake wishes.
26. 3-run homer vs Central Connecticut (3/4/23)
Earlier in this game Tommy hit the first tank of his LSU career. Fans were quietly concerned how long it was taking him to get the first. I love that he only waited two innings to hit the next and reassure us he was in his groove now.
25. Solo homer at Alabama (5/10/24)
Touched 'Em ALL@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/wwboTa0EWC
Okay yeah, LSU did lose this game in agonizing fashion, but this homer is so funny. You might remember LSU had a run taken off the board because Tommy didn’t touch third while rounding the bases. So look at his emphasis after the homer. That’s a man who knows drama.
24. 3-run homer vs Nicholls (4/23/24)
Get off the tracks when the train's comin' through@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/zUQ2fKWH3A
The final homer against Nicholls ranks the highest because it conks of that dude’s head. He was fine, so it’s pretty funny!
23. Solo homer vs Auburn (4/26/24)
Tommy opened the scoring on Friday night vs Auburn, leading to a series-opening win.
22. Solo homer vs Auburn (4/27/24)
Head on a swivel out there@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/Z23kXGNLae
Tommy opened the scoring on Saturday night vs Auburn, leading to a series-clinching win.
21. Solo homer vs Ole Miss (5/17/24)
Tommy was on fire in his last series at the Box. At the time we thought this would be his last one ever in Baton Rouge. This won’t be the last time this happens.
20. 2-run homer vs Northern Illinois (2/22/24)
T MMY@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/opbBcBiCL0
The first Tommy Tank of 2024. Much like the prior year it took longer than fans expected (5 games), but once again he ended up just fine.
19. Solo homer vs Alabama (4/28/23)
A cool homer that led to LSU winning the game 8-6. Surely there was nothing weird about this game on the Alabama side regarding their then-head coach and then-ace pitcher.
18. Solo homer at Georgia (5/19/23)
This helped clinch a series win after LSU dropped the previous two and was in a desolate place. This 8-4 win seems routine on paper, but it was massive.
17. Solo homer at Mississippi State (3/16/24)
Remember when I said Tommy hit home runs in all three games vs State in 2024? This was the one win! LSU won by an excruciatingly close 9-8, so the importance of this first inning shot can’t be understated.
16. 2-run homer vs Central Connecticut (3/4/23)
That's Mr. Tanks to you.@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/pzva5cxgyx
The one that started it all.
15. 3-run homer vs Alabama (4/29/23)
Tommy do be hitting tanks  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/JSfwnsQZVb
This is an example of a type of homer you’re gonna see a lot of soon: a spark. A lot of the 2024 homers at the bottom of the list came with LSU down multiple runs and Tommy pulling them closer. This is one where he did that and the rest of the offense woke up with him. If you remember this game, you might remember this was an incredibly long AB. Tommy earned this one and it swung the game. LSU ended up winning 12-8 to clinch a series win.
14. Grand slam vs Kentucky (5/22/24)
Lunchtime Lift Off  @tommywhite44 | SECN pic.twitter.com/eSiNXnubUh
The last one he ever hit. A little disappointing because there were eight games after this where he somehow didn’t leave the park, but a granny in that massive park is still a fantastic note to go out on.
13. Solo homer vs Texas (3/1/24)
Cue The Light Show ⚡️@tommywhite44 | https://t.co/hFbGbpQBpJ pic.twitter.com/WSOHa3i9kF
The first Tommy Tank in an MLB park. It won’t be the last.
12. Solo homer vs Ole Miss (5/18/24)
Tommy Tanks  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/wtbGufa0PF
This is the actual last one he hit in the Box. Fun fact: Tommy finished his career 6-0 against Ole Miss. You’re gonna see them again soon.
11. Solo homer vs Texas A&M (5/4/24)
Could You Be Loved@tommywhite44 | ESPN2 pic.twitter.com/B2kE6duo2o
Another spark: LSU went on to win 6-4 and clinch the series against the No. 1 team in the country. 
10. Run-rule walk-off vs Mississippi State (5/12/23)
TANKS CALLED GAME@tommywhite44 | #ThePowerhouse pic.twitter.com/6Ar9PWkStq
It’s a run-rule, but still counts as the first walk-off we’ve seen. Hmmm I wonder if there will be another. 
9. Solo homer at South Carolina (4/7/23)
Tommy Tanks doing Tommy Tanks things  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/qgAaEGFMse
You can’t overstate was a massive spark this was. The Tigers were beaten handily the night before due to a flukey rain delay knocking Paul Skenes out the game. LSU was on the ropes, but the offense roared to life and won 8-7 with all but one run coming off homers.
8. 2-run homer vs Kentucky (6/10/23)
TOMMY TANKS IS IN THE BUILDING BUT THAT BALL AIN'T @tommywhite44 | ESPNews pic.twitter.com/XeWXT2ceXG
I cannot get over how crazy this swing is. That’s a golf swing. God this game was so much fun. Let’s revisit it again!
7. Solo homer vs Kentucky (6/10/23)
TANK'D@tommywhite44 | ESPNews pic.twitter.com/DwAF1bOJPe
I know the game was already in hand and it only scored one run, but this might be the longest one he hit. I didn’t go back and verify all the random midweek homers, but this one felt like the longest. IT WENT OVER THE SCOREBOARD! Tom Hart’s reaction says it all. Also we get a brief Joe Burrow cameo! They just barely cut back in time and thank God they did.
6. Grand slam vs Ole Miss (5/18/24)
Mr. Tanks ON FIRE  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/hgXpE9JG72
Yet again we had what we believed would be Tommy’s last home run in the Box, but since this was a grand slam that basically sealed LSU’s first sweep of 2024, it gets higher marks. This is how we’ll remember him.
5. Grand slam vs Arkansas (3/25/23)
YOU JUST GOT TANK'D@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/nqhUuOaXQg
The first game in this series is the only time LSU truly lost a Skenes start. The other two were due to his day getting cut short because of weather and a non-essential SEC Tournament game. So dropping the Friday game was brutal. How would LSU bounce back on a Saturday double-header? By run-ruling them in the first game, then blasting them 14-5 in the nightcap. This grand slam wrapped it up and left no doubt LSU was the best team in the country.
4. Grand slam at Ole Miss (4/21/23)
Tommy Tanks knows how to party  @tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/U6xXLXdBxX
Pretty cool that Tommy White hit grand slams against Ole Miss in their stadium as well as ours. Ole Miss had gone ahead with a three-run shot off Skenes the prior inning and was going nuts. They looked like they maybe had reclaimed the swagger that helped them win the championship the year before. But then Mike Bianco inexplicably let his starting pitcher face Tommy immediately after loading the bases and going over 100 pitches. I’m truly shocked this happened.  
3. Solo homer vs Florida (6/24/23)
EVERYBODY HIT THE TOMMY @tommywhite44 | ESPN pic.twitter.com/blCQcWDtk1
You may be surprised this isn’t No. 2, but hear me out when we get there. I’m not gonna act like this wasn’t massive. There is a 99% chance LSU does not win the College World Series if this ball does not go out. It was getting real tense. But this one was blasted to tie the game up. LSU would win in the 11th inning and Ty Floyd’s 17-strikeout masterpiece was not wasted. This was the real championship game. LSU and Florida traded beatdowns the next two days, so this was truly the game that crowned LSU national champions. 
2. 3-run homer vs Arkansas (3/25/23)
Tommy Tanks is here.@tommywhite44 | SECN+ pic.twitter.com/Qznun8P3Xb
I know, this isn’t nearly as massive as the Florida shot. Even if Tommy hits into a double play here, we still probably go on to win with how we were hitting. But I’m sorry, this is so Tommy White. It’s what 2023 LSU always was at heart: a cocky team that knew they were gonna beat your ass. Tommy’s grand slam later in this game that you just saw put the cap on this game, but this swing won it. The Hogs knew they were outmatched here and the avalanche was coming. I’ll never forget watching this live. The non-conference domination wasn’t a fakeout this time. LSU was a championship contender and every game this season was appointment television. I’m so happy it all worked out.
