CONCORD, N.C. (QUEEN CITY NEWS) — Sunday’s sold-out Coca-Cola 600 brought tens of thousands of life-long and first-time fans out to Charlotte Motor Speedway.
Some came with high hopes of getting to see former president Donald Trump.

“We’re excited to see President Trump,” said longtime racing fan DJ Drake “It’d be cool to have a president here just in North Carolina at the race. How cool would that be to have the president come see the race?”
Trump arrived in Concord about an hour before the race.
Small business owners who sell Trump merchandise said they had more customers than a typical race weekend.
“It’s big. It’s big because I think it gives, it gives celebrity status to events like this, not that it needs more celebrity status, but it’s great,” said NASCAR fan John Bow.
Trump sat with owner Richard Childress to watch the race.
The former president will return to New York later in the week for closing arguments in his ongoing hush money trial.

Fans said a day at the track is a great stress reliever for anyone.
“I love this crowd, man. These are my people. I love this stuff,” said Bow. “I’m all about this all year. I wait for this all year long.”
Trump’s attendance required a large police presence in and around the speedway. Hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement agents assisted.
