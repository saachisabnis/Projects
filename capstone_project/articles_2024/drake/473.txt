Drake has previewed a new collaboration with Lil Durk on Adin Ross’ Kick livestream and the track features him rapping about quitting lean.
In the brief snippet of the song, which appears to be titled “Discontinuing Wockhardt,” Drizzy sing-raps a few bars that will likely take fans by surprise.

Over 808 Mafia-produced production, he raps: “Discontinuing Wockhardt / What seal do I pop now? / What seal do I pop now? / What seal do I pop now? / You know that the Act’ gone, I can’t get no Wock now.”
Wockhardt is a pharmaceutical giant which manufactures codeine, which is commonly mixed with a soft drink such as Sprite to create the recreational drug lean a.k.a. purple drank.

It is not known if Lil Durk also raps about the drug on the track, but he has been open about his issues with lean in the past.
Speaking to TMZ earlier this year, Smurk revealed he went to rehab due to drug addiction problems: “It helped me a lot. I want people to not run from it or be shy from it. It was tough at first but it ain’t that tough ’cause I really knew what I wanted. I knew what was holding me back.

“I wanted better. I wanted to be a better man, a better father, a better leader. I’m thinking clearer. My main goal is peace, being with the family and staying out of bullshit.”
The “All My Life” rapper also opened up about his mental state before he went to rehab: “I was moving fast, making excuses. I was letting the drugs take over me — like the codeine, Xanax. But it don’t make me.

“I just see myself staying on the right track and trying to change a lot of lives. This for the youth or the older people who wanna do better and feel like they embarrassed or like people gonna talk about them.”
Durk also said he wanted to help other recovering addicts by bilding a rehab facility in his hometown of Chicago.

While it’s unclear if “Discontinuing Wockhardt” will receive an official release, it marks the third collaboration between Drake and Lil Durk following the six-times platinum hit “Laugh Now Cry Later” and “In the Bible.”
For Drizzy, it’s also the latest in a flood of recent musical offerings since his high-profile beef with Kendrick Lamar fizzled out,
further suggesting that any notion of a break is out of the equation.
