Drake has been accused of deliberately avoiding Kendrick Lamar‘s upcoming  Super Bowl halftime show by booking a tour in Australia scheduled to start on the same day.
During his Kick livestream with xQc this past weekend, the 6 God revealed that he would be heading down under early next year for the first time in almost a decade.

Drizzy said that the tour kicks off on February 9, will be called the Anita Max Wynn Tour — a nod to his gambling alter ego — and will visit cities such as Melbourne and Sydney.
The date is notable as it is also the day of the Super Bowl LIX, which will see Drake’s nemesis, Kendrick Lamar, perform during the halftime show.

After Drake made the announcement, some fans suggested that he is trying to “duck” the big game, which is expected to be viewed by hundreds of millions of people around the world.
“Drake made sure he was busy on super bowl sunday lmaooo,” one user joked on X (formerly Twitter), while another added: “Drake is trying to duck that Super Bowl in February. Same exact day.”

A third said: “Drake choosing to go to Australia on the day of the Super Bowl and what’s clearly gonna be one of the greatest days in Hip Hop history. Is called self care. Lmao.”
Ohters, however, defended Drizzy’s decision, with Akademiks pointing out that the rapper will get paid for performing in Australia while Kendrick will be headlining the Super Bowl for free (as is the case for all halftime show performers).

Given the 17-hour time difference between New Orleans, where next year’s Super Bowl is being held, and Australia, it’s unlikely that Drake’s tour will directly clash with Kendrick’s performance.
Kendrick Lamar recently revealed that Nas was the only person to publicly congratulate him on landing the coveted halftime show slot, with the move receiving backlash from supporters of Lil Wayne who felt that he should have been picked.

On the opening song from his new album GNX, “wacced out murals,” Kendrick rapped: “Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me / All these n-ggas agitated, I’m just glad they showed they faces / Quite frankly, plenty artists but they outdated / Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite / This is not for lyricists, I swear it’s not the sentiments / Fuck a double entendre, I want y’all to feel this shit.”
After Kendrick was announced for the Super Bowl, Nas wrote on Instagram: “Congratulations to my brotha @kendricklamar. Can’t wait to watch the party die!!!!”
