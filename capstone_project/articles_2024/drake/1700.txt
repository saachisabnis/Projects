Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR plan to release their long-overdue joint album later this year. The OVO Sound founder shocked fans with the announcement during the final night of PND's "Sorry I'm Outside Tour" in their hometown of Toronto on Friday night, August 2. After PND wrapped up his set, Drizzy appeared as a surprise guest who blessed the crowd with an hour of his timeless R&B hits. At the end of his set, the 37-year-old artist revealed his and PND's plans to release a joint album this fall. “On behalf of me and Party, we’ve been working on something for y’all,” Drake told the crowd per Billboard.
“So, you get the summer over with, you do what you need to do," he continued. "I know all you girls are outside. When it gets a little chilly, PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake album will be waiting right there for you.”Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR have cooked up numerous hits together since Drizzy signed the Mississauga native to OVO in 2013. The two joined forces on "Over Here" for PND's self-titled debut EP and again on "Come Thru" from Nothing Was The Same that same year. They teamed up on PND's "Recognize" in 2014 and even produced a few songs on Drake's 2015 project If You're Reading This It's Too Late. The Grammy award-winning rapper and the esteemed singer recently reunited for "Members Only" on Drizzy's For All The Dogs album, which could be an example of what fans can expect on their forthcoming joint project. An exact release date hasn't been confirmed, however, the fall season is only a month away. During the show, Drake and PND performed revered collaborations like "Come and See Me." Drake also performed his viral rendition of "Wah Gwan Delilah" for the first time live. Check out more scenes from PARTYNEXTDOOR's final night on tour below.
