“Every fighter who’s beat me has lost their next one,” Chiesa told The MMA Hour. “I figured it out when Belal [Muhammad] was fighting Vicente [Luque] cause Vicente’s next fight was Belal and I worked the desk that night and I remember just kind of going through my notes and I’m like, ‘Oh, Vicente is gonna lose this fight’.
