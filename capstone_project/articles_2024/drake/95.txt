Jets linebacker Jamien Sherwood wasn’t penalized for his helmet-to-helmet hit that knocked Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye out of last week’s game, but he was fined.
Sherwood’s wallet took a hit to the tune of $6,354 for unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet). Maye took the helmet-to-helmet hit as he slid at the end of an 18-yard scramble.
Maye departed the game four plays later and was ruled out with a concussion. The Patriots still went on to win the game 25-22 with Jacoby Brissett taking over at quarterback.
Maye passed through concussion protocol this week and is expected to start Sunday against the Titans.
The Titans are expected to start Mason Rudolph. The Patriots didn’t rule anyone out or elevate any players from the practice squad for Sunday’s game.
