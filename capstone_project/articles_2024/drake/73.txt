The New England Patriots traded Josh Uche to the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday.
Uche was traded to the Chiefs in exchange for a 2026 sixth-round pick. While the Patriots rebuilding and trading off valuable assets might look good on the surface, the deal is a step back for New England.
The second-round selection in the 2020 NFL Draft is one of the rare draft picks that has been successful in New England. In 58 games, Uche racked up 20.5 sacks, 76 total tackles and two forced fumbles. The edge-rusher was one of the top performers on an impressive Patriots defense.
So, the fact that the Patriots only got a sixth-round pick is disappointing. This is a virtually nonexistent return for a player who was a quality contributor. 
It makes you wonder why New England even traded the pass-rusher. If this was the return the Patriots were going to get, why not just let him play out his contract?
Looking ahead, New England could very well make some more moves. The Patriots are clearly rebuilding as they look to acquire assets and build around the likes of Drake Maye, Rhamondre Stevenson, Kyle Dugger and Christian Gonzalez.
New England seems primed for another top-five pick, as the Pats are one of the worst teams in the NFL. If the season ended after Week 8, the Patriots would have the third selection in the 2025 NFL Draft.
The Pats lost a playmaker and didn't receive a lot in return. For a team that was struggling to get wins, moving Uche for just a sixth-round selection doesn't make a lot of sense.
