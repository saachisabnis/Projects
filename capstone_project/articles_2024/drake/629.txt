In news that only be described with “I know that’s right,” Whoopi Goldberg is putting rumors to rest and calling out the Trump at the exact same time.
On Tuesday’s episode of The View, the longtime host took the time out to address a false meme of herself that was circulating online. The image purported that Goldberg revealed she wouldn’t be staying in the United States and would be moving to Canada should Trump be elected as president again. Taking that as truth on Truth Social social media platform, Trump responded: “Canada doesn’t want you Whoopi, NOBODY DOES!!!”
While Goldberg didn’t take his dig too seriously, she took the opportunity to set the record straight.
“People always see these crazy memes, that I’m gonna leave the country if he gets in there. Somebody else thought I was leaving, was sending suggestions for people to take my place. Look,” Goldberg began. “I’m not going anywhere. And it’s not for the reason, you little snowflake, it’s not for the reason you think. He said nobody wanted me—hunny.”
After cohost Sunny Hostin and an audience member chimed in to affirm Goldberg, the “Sister Act” star continued: “I know where I’m gonna be ‘cause I got a contract, so I’m gonna be here where I’m wanted for the next couple of years.”
Goldberg calling Trump a snowflake is just one of the many digs she’s thrown his way over the years. Just one week ago, she went off on the 45th president for saying that there was an “anti-White” feeling running rampant through the country. Years ago, she criticized Trump again for pushing the “birther” propaganda against former President Obama, calling it the “biggest pile of dog mess I’ve heard in ages.” 
It’s no secret they’re both not fans of each other, here’s hoping the disses will end here and not be prolonged another four years during Trump’s potential second term. After all, between Kendrick Lamar, Drake, 50 cent, Diddy, and Meek Mill—I think we’ve had enough beefs this year.
