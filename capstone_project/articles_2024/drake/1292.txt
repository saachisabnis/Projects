According to a new report from Fightful, LA Knight will remain in WWE for years to come and with more money in his bank account.
The outlet reported that during the summer, Knight both restructured and extended his existing WWE contract for both “a large money increase” and “significant time.”
His original deal was set to expire in early-2025. The two sides had been reportedly negotiating as far as back as the fall of 2023.
After a run in the NWA, the man once known as Eli Drake debuted in NXT in February 2021 under his new name and was called up to the main roster in January 2022 as a manager named Max Dupri which was eventually dropped. In 2023, Knight’s popularity exploded thanks to his promos that evoked memories of both Steve Austin and The Rock.
Set to turn 42 this November, Knight defeated Logan Paul for the United States title at this past weekend’s WWE SummerSlam to begin his first WWE title reign of any kind. He will be on Friday’s SmackDown to hold a championship celebration.
