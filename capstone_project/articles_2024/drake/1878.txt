Drake didn’t even get an hour to enjoy the release of “Family Matters.” Kendrick Lamar was right back at him with “Meet the Grahams.”
The scratching and intense diss track saw Lamar pen personal letters to Drake’s son, Adonis, mom and dad, Sandra and Dennis, and the biggest one, another alleged hidden child. In the song, Lamar speaks to the unidentified 11-year-old daughter:
I’m sorry that your father not active inside your worldHe don’t commit to much but his music, yeah, that’s for sureHe a narcissist, misogynist, livin’ inside his songsTry destroy families rather than takin’ care of his ownShould be teachin’ you time tables or watchin’ Frozen with youOr at your eleventh birthday, singin’ poems with youInstead, he be in Turks, payin’ for sex and poppin’ Percs, examples that you don’t deserveI wanna tell you that you’re loved, you’re brave, you’re kindYou got a gift to change the world, and could change your father’s mind‘Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusionMoney’s always been illusion, but that’s the life he’s used toHis father prolly didn’t claim him neitherHistory do repeats itself, sometimes it don’t need a reasonBut I would like to say it’s not your fault that he’s hidin’ another childGive him grace, this the reason I made Mr. MoraleSo our babies like you can cope laterGive you some confidence to go through somethin’, it’s hope laterI never wanna hear you chase a man ’cause his failed behaviorSittin’ in the club with sugar daddies for validationYou need to know that love is eternity and trumps all painI’ll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rainsYes, he’s a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, rightAnd a fuckin’ deadbeat that should never say “more life”
