exponentially larger. When people ask where it will all end —— the cap goes up as television revenue, gate and stadium revenue all rise. Television networks appear to use the NFL as a loss leader for network exposure and this trend shows no sign of abating.
If we look at growth in the salary cap in different decades you can see how the NFL has really calmed things down over the initial era of the cap pic.twitter.com/piAut2jdPL

Great clip of Jeffrey Wright talking about his Commanders fanhood. He and Josh Harris were summer camp buddies! You name change folks, will like what he has to say. But maybe still need some patience. https://t.co/p80NDowR13
Talk about it, be open and be willing to growChanging the Narrative presented by @VHCHealth pic.twitter.com/fLQaiqYUBD
Nell lol, they are not having a QB competition between Sam and the number 2 overall draft pick. They also should not have one. https://t.co/FTjnDT8M2k
The cutting Wylie thing is silly. I get most fans hate him, but cutting him would cost nearly 8m in dead cap and only save 1.5m. Might as well just keep him, even if it’s just as a back up. Makes much more sense to cut him next year when those numbers flip
Jonathon Brooks (@2brookss) and Ray Davis (@Ray_Davis07) are @MJD players to watch at the #NFLCombine pic.twitter.com/U4EU3YAw3B
I know many of you LOVE college football, but as I start to dive into these college QBs, it’s hard for me to even watch: very few play on schedule, the pass concepts are a mess most of the time, they run the same play over & over, a million bubble screens, can’t find many…
More from @LFletcher59 on QB at No. 2: "It's hard not to watch this year's film and not think Daniels is the guy. His film this year was impressive...Drake Maye's 2022 film was as good as Daniels this year...Whoever it is I'm going to support him."
Talking w @LFletcher59 about Commanders: "This coaching staff on paper is as impressive as I've seen....We heard that people want to work with Dan Quinn and now you're seeing it."
Talking w @bradbiggs about Bears plans at No. 1: "I expect them to draft a QB at No. 1 overall...See if they can find a trade partner for Justin Fields...The process begins with Caleb Williams but there's a lot of heavy lifting to do...They've got to continue to do their due…

 @TomPelissero Deal or no deal that probable 1st overall pick Caleb Williams isn't hiring an agent ahead of the #NFLCombine and #NFLDraft?#NFL #DaBears #HTTC #Patriots pic.twitter.com/r1XBW5gWTX
Was drafted by Dan Quinn's Atlanta Falcons and signed by the 49ers last year, so has ties to Adam Peters too. Certianly not a must-have, priority free agent but might be a depth option to keep an eye on for Washington https://t.co/MKcLF1WIbr
Played for Quinn and Whitt in Atlanta … https://t.co/NeTG1vtMjR
Isaiah Oliver's dad Muhammad Oliver was a cornerback in Washington from 1995-1996 and his uncle Damon Mays was a wide receiver in Washington in 1996. https://t.co/8w9C86V8F1
The #Dolphins have informed CB Xavien Howard he will be released at the start of the league year, sources tell me and @PSchrags. The four-time Pro Bowl selection is expected to have significant interest on the market.
NFL free agency news:  4-time Pro Bowl CB Xavien Howard will be released by the Dolphins at the start of the league year, source confirms (1st - @MikeGarafolo).Howard should have a robust market. Will be interesting to see if Washington chooses to target pricier FAs.
Thaddeus Moss, the son of Hall of Fame WR Randy Moss, has signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL. Last year, he played for Birmingham of the USFL. https://t.co/f3MPhzUAgJ

Caps are coming to south FL with their own injury issues. Nic Dowd left in win over Devils and Martin Fehervary has missed two games. Last night in win over Bolts, TJ Oshie was in great distress after non-contact issue, fell to ice and had to be helped to the room. #TimeToHunt
Here is the non-contact Oshie injury. He’s 4 games from 1,000 in his outstanding career.    pic.twitter.com/OIbAynJB92
Carbery told reporters in Florida that they will continue to monitor T.J. Oshie. Didn’t share any definitely updates with regard to timeline, but didn’t skate today and won’t skate tomorrow. Says it’s too early to tell the severity.
This makes sense #HTTC pic.twitter.com/ne2PCROonZ
