The NFL draft is loaded with intriguing quarterback prospects this year, with Caleb Williams the overwhelming favorite to be the top overall player selected, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye and J.J. McCarthy all receiving top-four buzz and Michael Penix Jr. potentially a candidate to go later in the first round.
So where does that leave a player like Bo Nix?
According to ESPN's Jordan Reid, the Oregon quarterback didn't exactly clear up the main questions scouts had about him during the Senior Bowl:
The B/R NFL Scouting Department ranked Nix 81st among all prospects on its latest big board, fifth among quarterbacks (he was one spot higher than Penix).
On an NFL team that lets him run an RPO, spread-style offense, Nix could potentially thrive. But whether he can make downfield, tight-window throws in crunch time remains to be seen, and those questions could hinder both his draft stock and overall upside.
