The Seattle Seahawks entered their Week 10 bye week last Sunday having lost four of their previous five games, prompting first-year head coach Mike Macdonald to re-evaluate the program, particularly on defense.
Macdonald made a change by waiving starting middle linebacker Tyrel Dodson, the team announced Monday. The move was a surprise, considering Dodson had started all nine games and led the team in tackles this season. Dodson had posted 71 total tackles, along with five tackles for loss, two sacks, a forced fumble and two passes defensed.
The release of Dodson continues a shakeup at the position. The Seahawks acquired Ernest Jones IV in a trade with the Tennessee Titans that sent Jerome Baker to Tennessee on Oct. 23. 
Dodson signed a one-year, $4.26 million deal with the Seahawks in March after spending his first five seasons with the Buffalo Bills.
With Dodson out, Drake Thomas, an undrafted free agent in 2023 or rookie Tyrice Knight, a fourth-round pick (No. 118) in the 2024 NFL draft, are the candidates to step into the starting lineup.
