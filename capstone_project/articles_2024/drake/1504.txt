Stevens averaged 15.1 points, 4.6 assists, 3.6 rebounds, 2.1 turnovers and 0.7 steals a game against the Pack.
WOLF PACK ADVANTAGE: The Pack, one of the best 3-point shooting teams in the nation, would appear to have a huge edge over the Rams from beyond the arc. The Pack is shooting a Mountain West-best .419 this year on threes while Colorado State is ninth in the 11-team conference at .307. The Wolf Pack defense is also better against the three than Colorado State's defense. The Pack is sixth in the conference, holding opponents to a .330 success rate while the Rams are 10th (.359).
COLORADO STATE LEADERS: Nique Clifford (6-6) leads the Mountain West in rebounding (10.5) and is eighth in scoring (16.4) while handing out 3.3 assists. Jalen Lake (6-4) is averaging 14.6 points, is 21-of-23 from the line and 26-of-71 on threes. New point guard Kyle Evans (6-2) is averaging 7.3 points and 2.6 assists. Keyshawn Williams (6-3) is averaging 7.3 points while Jaylen Crocker-Williams (6-8) is at 7.6 points and 4.3 rebounds. Freshman Kyle Jorgensen (6-9) is at 6.4 points and 2.7 rebounds.

Tre Coleman (6-7) contributes 4.3 assists, 9.0 points and 3.2 rebounds. Xavier DuSell (6-4) is among the top 3-point shooters in the conference (28-of-63) and is averaging 8.8 points a game. Brandon Love (6-9) is adding 8.0 points and 4.3 rebounds. Tyler Rolison comes off the bench to add 6.7 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists.
DUSELL AGAINST THE RAMS: This will be Xavier DuSell's first game against Colorado State as a member of the Wolf Pack. But the Rams are very familiar with him. DuSell, who played three years with Wyoming and one with Fresno State, will be facing the Rams for the eighth time in his career on Saturday. DuSell has averaged 8.3 points a game in his career against the Rams while making 15-of-40 (.375) 3-pointers. His best game against Colorado State was the first time he faced them on Feb. 4, 2021, with 17 points and five threes. DuSell is not the only Pack player with a long history against the Rams. Nick Davidson (8.3 points a game over four games), Tre Coleman (7.1 points a game over seven games) and K.J. Hymes (5.3 points a game over nine games) also have extensive experience in the rivalry.
NEW-LOOK MOUNTAIN WEST: This will be the first of 20 Mountain West games this season for both the Rams and Wolf Pack. The conference has expanded its league schedule this year from 18 to 20 games (home and away against the other 10 teams) after playing 18 games a year since 2013-14, except for 2020-21 when cancellations from COVID-19 restrictions hampered the schedules. Each Mountain West team played 14 conference games from 1999-2000 through 2004-05 and again in 2011-12. Each team played 16 league games a year from 2005-06 through 2010-11 and again in 2012-13.
