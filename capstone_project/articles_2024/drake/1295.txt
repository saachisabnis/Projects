Just when I thought I had seen it all, along comes a Cybertruck pulling a giant Elon Musk bust in South Texas. 
The hilarious part is that it isn’t actually a bust of Elon Musk himself. Instead, it’s a bust based on a really bad portrait of him someone drew. 
And to tell you the truth, I never would have guessed it was Elon Musk. Because, well, it looks nothing like him whatsoever.
It’s interesting, though, because a lot of people are speculating on X that the bust is being carted around by crypto scammers. Admittedly, I’m not very well-versed in the crypto thing, so I can’t comment on that. 
But if it does turn out to be part of some sort of scam, I’ll be so disappointed. Scammers are the lowest of the low and I would hate to promote something that gave me a good laugh but turned out to actually be a scam.
