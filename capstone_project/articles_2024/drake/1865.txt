Updated at 11:56 a.m. - Incident Commander Mike Smith with the Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forests provided an update a short time ago. Here are the most important points:
A Complex Incident Management Team has been ordered. They'll take command of the fire and bring in a lot more people and equipment than is currently available. Meanwhile, mandatory evacuation orders remain in effect.
The fire is currently at 1,820 acres with zero containment. It burned steadily throughout the night with low humidity. Breezes are expected to pick up this afternoon which will contribute to the fire's spread. According to the Forest Service, 220 ground crews and several helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are working the fire.
Officials also provided an update on the fire's perimeter:
Updated at 9:12 a.m. - Firefighters expect the arrival of two "super scooper" planes today. The aircraft dip down to lakes and reservoirs, fill a belly with water, then dump it on the fire. Today‚Äôs firefighting strategy will be dictated by wind and weather, and officials have yet to share details about any specific plans for the day.
‚ÄúOur first priority is to make sure we protect and preserve life, and make sure everybody is safe from there,‚Äù said Ali Adams, a public information officer with the Larimer County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.
Adams said officials plan to hold a briefing later this morning, and potentially hold another in the afternoon.
Updated at 8:10 a.m. - Officials with the U.S. Forest Service said the fire did not spread much overnight. It was measured at 992 acres on Monday night. The fire crept slowly downhill overnight, with no major runs. Forest service officials said they will share more updates this morning after briefing their own staff.
Updated at 6:47 a.m. - Some people in the mandatory evacuation areas will not receive their mail today. According to the US Postal Service, impacted customers will be able to retrieve their mail at designated alternative post offices and should check with the post office for specific locations. The post offices in Masonville and Drake are temporarily closed while the fire continues to burn.
