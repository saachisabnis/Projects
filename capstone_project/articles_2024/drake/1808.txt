WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Wichita State suffered their first loss of the season at Charles Koch Arena on Tuesday night, losing to UMKC, 74-64. 
After what was likely their worst half of the season, the Shockers found themselves trailing UMKC, 38-24, at halftime. They showed some improvement in the final five minutes of the second half, narrowing their deficit to 10 points. However, it wasn’t enough to secure a 6-0 home record.
“I didn’t think the energy was what it needed to be until the 14-minute mark. That’s gotta be corrected because this is not the standard at which we need to play,” said Mills during the post-game press conference. “I honestly feel bad for Shocker fans having to watch the first 25 minutes of that basketball game because that is not the standard around here. And, we’ll address it we’ll get better.”
