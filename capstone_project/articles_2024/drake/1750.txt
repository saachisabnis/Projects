DJ Khaled has been sure and confident of himself from the very beginning, so it’s no surprise that he has high hopes for his new album — especially since one of his longtime collaborators will be assisting on it.
On Sunday (February 18), the 48-year-old took to Instagram to tease an upcoming project that he says is “in the works.” The only detail he revealed was that it will contain two tracks from Drake.

“Love to everybody that has ever had a chance to work with Drake or got to experience the greatness from my brother,” he said in the clip. 
“But what I have locked and loaded in the can? You ever heard word-for-word, sing word-for-word?” he asked, miming a performer singing onstage and asking the crowd to respond.

In the same video, Khaled also said: “It’s time to get back to the hits.”
This is notable considering the We The Best mogul has had only three songs crack the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the past five years (“Popstar,” “Greece” and “Staying Alive”).

His biggest smashes came in mid-2017, when he went No. 1 with “I’m the One” in May and No. 2 with “Wild Thoughts” in July.
Khaled has previously talked about having two Drake songs on his next album.
During the first of two shows of Drizzy’s Its All a Blur Tour last fall, Drizzy recruited the superstar DJ to accompany him for his customary stage walk. In true Khaled marketing fashion, he decided to bring a huge sign with him that read: “I have 2 Drake songs on my new album — coming 2024.”

“When you come out with the 6 God, you gotta go hard, ” he said in a video he posted on Instagram showing Drake laughing beside him. “You can’t just come out. We ain’t playing with this!”
Khaled has also said that the project will feature Lil Baby, Future and Lil Uzi Vert, who were all featured on last year’s single, “Supposed To Be Loved.”
He also previously announced that the album will be titled Til Next Time.
