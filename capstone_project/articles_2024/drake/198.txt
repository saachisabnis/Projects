According to AP, in the early morning of Tuesday (May 7th), authorities arrived at the scene to investigate a shooting that happened at Drake's Toronto Mansion. Toronto Police has confirmed that one of his security guards is seriously wounded, and footage was recovered from the property. 
For weeks, Drake and other rap artists have been dropping diss tracks at each other. Authorities are aware of the beef between the artists but are not pointing any fingers since the investigation is still in its early stages.
