Lil Yachty first revealed his “Concrete Boys” edition of the Nike Air Force 1 Low just shy of a year ago, but anticipation for the sneaker was quickly killed by reports that it would be exclusive to friends and family. Hope is now reanimated, however, as retailer images of the AF1 have surfaced along with reports that it will launch at ComplexCon later this month. 
Lil Yachty’s Nike Air Force 1 Low “Concrete Boys” sticks to a white and navy color palette with his label’s sledgehammer figure embroidered onto the lateral heel and the fuller construction site logo appearing on the mustache. “It’s Us” appears on the tongue tag along with the Nike Swoosh, and apart from those navy blue marks the upper is rendered entirely in white leather to match the midsole. Navy is then used further for the outsole and sockliner, while the insole appears in a lighter blue.

The only difference between the pair releasing and the one made for friends and family is that the latter featured a “C” logo on the left mustache.

The Air Force 1 Low will mark Lil Yachty’s first collaboration with Nike, although he’s became close to the brand in recent years by helping to reveal Cactus Plant Flea Market’s Air Flea 2 and latest crop of Air Force 1 Lows, as well as Nigel Sylvester’s Air Jordan 4 RM. 
He’ll also add his name to a lineage of hip-hop label-affiliated Air Force 1 Lows that includes Fat Joe’s Terror Squad and Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records, as well as following up Travis Scott and Drake’s recent editions of the sneaker. 
The Lil Yachty x Nike Air Force 1 Low “Concrete Boys” will reportedly release November 16 at ComplexCon, and the Foot Patrol images published here suggest a wider release will follow. Pricing has not yet been confirmed.
