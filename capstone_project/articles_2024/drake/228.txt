Bailey
Party: Republican
Age (as of Oct. 1): 56
Home city: Papillion 
Occupation: Assistant director for flight training and a lecturer at the Aviation Institute at UNO
Family: Sherry, third grade teacher at Carriage Hill Elementary in Papillion; three children (27, 27 and 24)
Elected offices held: Papillion LaVista Community Schools board, 2020-present; PLCS board vice president 2021-2022; PLCS board president, 2022-2023

Why are you running for office? 
After four years on the PLC school board, I'm proud of the great work our school board has done in the last four years, including passing the largest bond in PLCS history. I want to oversee the conclusion of the improvements this bond will fund. I want to work for the next four years to ensure that our students continue to grow and improve as they all strive for excellence. Finally, I want to continue my advocacy for the teachers and staff of PLCS.
What experiences qualify you for this office? 
I have served on the Papillion LaVista school board for the last four years. I know how much work it takes to run the fourth-largest school district in the state of Nebraska. I have been a teacher at UNO for the last 8½ years, and my wife has been a teacher in the PLCS district for 15 years. I've been in the classroom, and I've seen first-hand the hard work our teachers and staff put in every day. If I'm reelected, I will use those experiences to continue to advocate for public education.
What is your top priority? 
As a property owner and taxpayer, I understand the fight against raising taxes. However, as a parent of children who utilized our public school system, I also understand the importance of that tax money to provide the best education for our students. As a school board member, my top priority is to spend wisely, save where possible and advocate to the Nebraska Legislature to continue to find additional ways to fund public schools that don’t involve raising our already high property taxes.
How can the board help address the struggle to recruit and retain teachers? 
The board needs to offer pay increases when the budget allows, but we also need to address class sizes so our teachers have a manageable number of students to teach. The board also needs to seek new ways to deal with student behavior so our teachers can concentrate on teaching and spend a minimal amount of time with discipline. Finally, the board must work with administrators to ensure teachers have protected plan time during the school day so they aren't planning lessons and grading at home.
What do you think is the most important problem facing students and families when it comes to public school education? 
Currently, the biggest problem is the economy. As families struggle with their personal finances, the stress our parents are under is felt by our students. If students come to school but are focused on family issues, they aren't prepared to learn. This translates into poor performance in school and possibly even behavior issues. The board, administrators, teachers and staff need to continue to communicate with parents about what is happening outside school. "It takes a village."
What do you think about the Opportunity Scholarships program, which provides taxpayer money for private school students’ tuition?
I do not agree with the Opportunity Scholarship program. We pay taxes for many things, including public education, which is open for all children to attend. Private schools are not governed by the same state regulations and choose who can attend. Parents can choose to send their children to a private school, but forcing taxpayers to fund these "scholarships" for private school tuition without holding the private schools accountable to the same regulations as public schools is wrong.
Butler
Party: Independent
Age (as of Oct. 1): 41
Home city: Papillion
Occupation: City clerk, City of Omaha
Family: Jim Butler (husband), engineer, two sons
Elected offices held: None
Website: VoteElizabethButler.com
Education: political science, Creighton University; master's in public administration, Drake University
Why are you running for office? 
I’m running because voters deserve a candidate that will work to build a school district that is attractive to families, teachers and students.
As a mom, the best part of serving on the board will be making decisions that will impact an important part of my kids' day, their education. I want all kids to be successful; to get an education that will prepare them for the next chapters in their lives.
What experiences qualify you for this office?
I am a proven leader. For the past 15 years, I have served in a top government position as the city clerk, previously in Papillion and currently in Omaha. My government knowledge and passion for learning will guide me to improve process, provide feedback on policies and make information more transparent. I will also use my government budgeting expertise to ensure the tax levy remains as low as possible, while still providing necessary resources for teachers and students to succeed.
What is your top priority?
If elected, I will work to provide opportunities and programs that will serve this community. Specifically, I want to expand early childhood education and hire more mental health counselors and behavior specialists.
I will also work to keep the tax levy low and will work to maintain local control. It is also important for the board to plan for the future. This community is growing, and we need to make decisions now that will set future boards up for success.
How can the board help address the struggle to recruit and retain teachers?
We have great schools, and a big part of that is the teachers. The board can set hiring policies and wages to retain and attract talent. For me, teachers are not just numbers in a budget, they are people with families. We need to pay them competitive wages and provide them with the resources they need to be successful.
What do you think is the most important problem facing students and families when it comes to public school education?
Ensuring students are able to have basic needs met, so that they are ready to succeed when at school. Making sure that students have the resources for success will enhance opportunities, open doors to new things, and help them experience success on an individual level. A quality public education can guarantee that they will be afforded every opportunity to learn and be successful.
What do you think about the Opportunity Scholarships program, which provides taxpayer money for private school students’ tuition?
I am an advocate for maintaining local control and keeping public funds for public schools. I believe that private schools are great too, and families make decisions that are best for their situations. I feel there is a better mechanism to achieve the goal of the opportunity scholarships without using public dollars.
Fisher
Party: Republican
Age (as of Oct. 1): 65
Home city: Bellevue
Occupation: Supervisor, policyowner services, Mutual of Omaha
Family: Douglas E. Fisher, truck driver at SAIA, two adult children
Elected offices held: PLCS Board of Education (24 years)
Website: None
Education: Bachelor of Science, University of Nebraska at Omaha
Why are you running for office?
I believe all educational choices are critical; however, the majority of children are educated through the public school system, therefore, it is paramount to ensure our public school system is strong, providing outstanding educational opportunities for all students. My parents instilled an emphasis on giving back through community service, so my focus was to serve on my local board of education, something my parents were extremely proud of. I feel I have value to continue to add in this role.
What experiences qualify you for this office?
My past and current service on the PLCS board, along with being a graduate of the district (as are my husband and children), make me well-qualified for this position. Over the years, I have attended many educational opportunities and events to ensure I was/am well-versed in the intricacies of board member responsibilities, the challenges of school district financing in Nebraska and the expectations for students and staff when it comes to the educational process.
What is your top priority? 
My top priority is to continue to ensure we are offering robust educational opportunities that will prepare all PLCS students for the future whether the workforce, the military, learning a trade or a two- or four-year college. To guarantee the district can continue along this path, we must have the necessary financing to continue to provide outstanding staff, and return educational decisions to local control whenever possible.
How can the board help address the struggle to recruit and retain teachers?
The PLCS district has continued to implement methods to reduce concerns over the ability to recruit and retain staff such as providing students with an awareness of Education as a career path. We are constantly looking for new and creative ideas, working in partnership with our teachers. While all ideas may not fit within our financial constraints, the board understands the need to keep recruitment and retention at the forefront of discussions with the Administration.
What do you think is the most important problem facing students and families when it comes to public school education?
School safety combined with student mental health are paramount concerns for students and families. School safety must always be taken into consideration, whether building a new school or upgrading a building within the district. Mental Health is discussed continuously always looking for additional services to best meet the needs of students and families as well as staff. Addressing school safety and student mental health needs are necessary for student success and family security.
What do you think about the Opportunity Scholarships program, which provides taxpayer money for private school students’ tuition?
There is no doubt this is a contentious issue within the state and locally. When families feel public schools are not for them, my hope is all children can find an educational opportunity that works for their success. I become concerned when one educational opportunity is not held to the same expectations (mandates). While I want children to have the best chance for success, I am not certain that the Opportunity Scholarship program is the answer.
Kloeckner
Party: Republican
Age (as of Oct. 1): 44
Home city: Papillion
Occupation: Accounting specialist, self-employed
Family: Andrew Kloeckner, husband, attorney; two children
Elected offices held: None
Website: www.votecarlak.com
Education: University of Nebraska
Why are you running for office?
As the mother of two children currently in PLCS schools, a longtime Papillion resident and life-long Nebraskan, I care deeply about our community and our public schools. It has been 17 years since a mother with children currently in our schools has served on the board. I saw a need to bring fresh faces and voices to our school board.
What experiences qualify you for this office?
I have worked and volunteered within our schools and community for 15 years, including OneWorld (president emeritus), Methodist Hospital Volunteers in Partnership (president emeritus), PLHS Band Boosters Board, Hickory Hill PTO and Beautiful Savior Luther Church (volunteer instructor K-5). It has taught me to engage effectively with people who have different views and opinions. I'm also the mother of two children currently attending our public schools.
What is your top priority?
My top priority is creating public schools where every student can thrive. This includes empowering parents by giving them a voice in their children's education. I also support enabling our teachers and staff with the resources they need to be successful and embracing technology to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Additionally, I am committed to ensuring that we are good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.
How can the board help address the struggle to recruit and retain teachers?
We must ensure teachers have adequate resources, including aides, materials and manageable class sizes, to prevent burnout. It is also important to make sure our teachers' compensation packages are competitive. We must do a better job at creating channels where teachers feel heard and valued. Listening to their concerns and acting on feedback can reduce turnover. We need to offer growth opportunities and implement mentoring for new teachers to help them transition smoothly and feel supported.
What do you think is the most important problem facing students and families when it comes to public school education?
The most pressing issue facing many students and families is behavioral health. It's vital to identify and address these challenges early on. Mental and emotional health affects students' academic performance, behavioral problems in the classroom and social engagement. Schools face challenges providing resources for parents and educators to support students effectively.
What do you think about the Opportunity Scholarships program, which provides taxpayer money for private school students’ tuition?
In Nebraska, we are fortunate to have high-quality public education. We even allow families to opt into other public school districts if they feel that their child's needs are not being met. Our focus as taxpayers should be to offer a quality public education to all children and not funnel funds into private schools. High quality public schools are the most important steppingstone to our children's personal success, our community's success and the success of our state.
Marcus Madler and family
Party: Nonpartisan
Age (as of Oct. 1): 39
Home city: Papillion
Occupation: Senior manager, Business Intelligence Analytics at WP Engine
Family: Married for 15 years to Kristen Madler. Kristen is a high school counselor at Papillion-La Vista High School. We have two boys at Tara Heights Elementary.
Elected offices held: Papillion La Vista school board 2021-current
Website: marcusmadler.com
Education: Finance degree from UNL and MBA from UNO
Why are you running for office?
I’m running for reelection to continue supporting our students, families and staff in PLCS. As a district graduate, parent to students and husband of a school counselor, I understand the challenges and strengths of our schools. I’m committed to ensuring our district remains strong and that we provide all students with the education and opportunities they need to succeed in a changing world.
What experiences qualify you for this office?
I’ve served on the Papillion La Vista school board since 2021, with this past year as president. I was also a board member of the Papillion La Vista Community Schools Foundation from 2014 to 2023. My background in data analytics and building teams, along with 10+ years of actively supporting our schools, enables me to make strategic decisions. As a parent, I’m committed to ensuring every student has access to a quality education which will strengthen the entire community.
What is your top priority?
My top priority is ensuring every student in our district has the opportunity to succeed, whether through college preparation, trade skills or workforce readiness. We need to continue supporting our teachers with the resources they need to excel in the classroom, while offering robust academic and career-readiness programs for students.
How can the board help address the struggle to recruit and retain teachers?
As the spouse of a PLCS counselor and former classroom teacher, I understand the challenges our educators face. To recruit and retain high quality educators, we must offer competitive pay and benefits, foster a supportive environment, and continually listen to staff pain points. The board needs to continually work on addressing these issues, focusing on solutions for workload, mental health and professional growth opportunities.
What do you think is the most important problem facing students and families when it comes to public school education?
Ensuring all students have equal access to academic support, mental health resources and extracurricular opportunities is critical. We must also offer a curriculum that is both engaging and appropriately challenging to help students reach their potential. Providing diverse activities and programs ensures students stay engaged, leading to higher achievement and better behavior.
What do you think about the Opportunity Scholarships program, which provides taxpayer money for private school students’ tuition?
I believe public funds should remain in public schools, which serve the majority of students and are accountable to the community. Public schools can’t pick and choose their students to boost test scores or reduce costs. We must provide an education for everyone, and diverting funds to private schools weakens the resources available to meet all students' needs.
