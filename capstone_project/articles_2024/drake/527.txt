NFL analyst gives QB to Giants in 2024 re-draft
After failing to move up for the quarterback of their choice in the 2024 NFL Draft, the New York Giants passed on taking one of J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix Jr. or Bo Nix at No. 6. 
In re-drafting the top 10 of that draft, Bucky Brooks of FOX Sports believes Nix would have been the “perfect fit” for the Giants. In giving Nix to the Giants in his re-draft, Brooks writes:
Given Daniel Jones’ tenuous status as the Giants’ franchise quarterback, Nix is the perfect heir apparent based on his experience, poise and playmaking potential. With 64 collegiate starts and an ultra-cool demeanor that enables him to handle the bright lights and big stage, the rookie ends up being the perfect fit for a team in desperate need of a long-term QB1. 
The Denver Broncos took Nix at No. 12 and the rookie has had tremendous success, putting himself in the Rookie of the Year discussion as Denver has gone 8-5. Whether he could have had that kind of success with the Giants will never be known.
We know things did not work out for Jones and the Giants. The Giants, 2-11 and with the possibility of having the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, are still in the quarterback market with Shedeur Sanders, Cam Ward and Jalen Milroe as possibilities.
Interestingly, Malik Nabers, the Giants’ choice at No. 6, falls out of Brooks’ re-draft.
Here is Brooks’ re-drafted top 10:
