Charlotte Flair and Hollywood have shown interest in each other on and off for a while now. But aside from a role as “sexy badass Heather Rockrear” in 2017’s Psych: The Movie, none of the film projects she’s been linked to have panned out.
If the one Deadline announced today (May 14) reaches our screens, it sounds like Flair will have a prominent role in it — and once again be playing a villain. 
A horror/thriller from writer/director Carlos “Spiff TV” Suarez’s Averted Vision Pictures independent production company and starring Six Feet Under and Planet Terror’s Freddy Rodriguez, Deadline describes Charlotte (referred to by her legal name Ashley Elizabeth Fliehr)’s new project thusly:
You Lose You Die follows sociopathic tech expert, Mr. Fantastik (Rodriguez), who runs a popular show on the dark web with two other sociopathic tech experts, Ms. Perfect (Fliehr) and Mr. Creep (Anthony Alvarez). On the show, thousands of viewers vote on games and challenges for prisoners to participate in. If the prisoners lose, viewers vote on the weapons the sociopaths use to kill them.
Sounds pretty gnarly! “Ms. Perfect” is a great name for The Queen, too. Flair is currently rehabbing after knee surgery that is supposed to keep her out until August.
You Lose You Die will be Suarez’s big screen directorial debut, but he has experiencing producing everything from music to film, and has directed music videos for the likes of Drake and Rick Ross.
Will it make it to a theater or streaming service near you? Stay tuned.
