The other day, I heard someone talking about the city of Portland and they clarified that they were talking about the city in Maine, not Ore-uh-GON. 
My right eye started twitching. 
It’s pronounced OR-aginn, for crying out loud. At least, that’s the way I’ve always been taught to say it.
It’s also a hoot to hear people mispronounce these Oregon LANDMARKS, like…
Heceta Head Lighthouse
Champoeg State Park
Ankeny National Wildlife Refuge
