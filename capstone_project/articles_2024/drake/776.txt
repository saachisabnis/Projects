Tory Lanez’s 10-year prison sentence will include a divorce. Raina Chassagne, the recording artist’s wife, filed a divorce petition, reported by TMZ on Monday afternoon (June 10), citing irreconcilable differences after the couple was married in June 2023.

Lanez, real name Daystar Peterson, and Chassagne share a 7-year-old son together, whom she is also requesting legal and physical custody of with the divorce. Before marrying in 2023, Lanez and Chassagne’s relationship remained a mystery. According to her Facebook account, she was born and raised in Florida. 
Tory lived in Miami, Florida, before his arrest in 2020. In November 2022, he shared his last photo with his son with the caption: “I miss you so much… I don’t know why they put me in a whole other state … but I can’t wait to see you twin.”

As a result of the July 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion, Tory Lanez was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison in August 2023. Since his incarceration, Tory has released two albums, which address Megan Thee Stallion and the shooting incident. 
Tory Lanez has received support from Drake and Nicki Minaj during his incarceration. In response, several of Megan Thee Stallion’s tracks, including her latest hit, “Hiss,” dissed the two megastars.
There is no word on whether the divorce will result in extradition to Canada. It is alleged that Lanez originally married the mother of his child to remain in the United States. Lanez was born in Brampton, Canada in 1992.
