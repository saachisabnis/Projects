The offseason is off to a pretty good start.  Lots of wailing and gnashing of the teeth.
Are you not entertained?

Lions’ Success Emphasizes Importance of Upcoming NFL Draft for Vikings
Vikings drafting truly has been less than stellar to say the least especially in the early rounds save for JJ, Darrisaw, and Addison.
The 2020 draft was where the team had the chance to do like the Packers and could have drafted Jordan Love instead of Jeff Gladney. Cousins could have mentored Love.
The 2021 3rd round was horrific. Kellen Mond (who I liked), Chazz Surratt, Wyatt Davis, and Patrick Jones II followed up by Nwangu did the team no favors.
