SIKESTON — Jennifer Baker of Sikeston MediCenter Pharmacy donated her 2015 Chevy Sonic to the Sikeston Career and Technology Center during the March 12 regular Sikeston R-6 Board of Education meeting at Central Office. 
The vehicle will be used as the new “suspect vehicle” for the Criminal Justice Program.
“The car will be used by students to learn proper procedure when completing traffic stops and vehicle searches,” said Natalie Bohannon, marketing and communications specialist for Sikeston Public Schools. “We are excited to receive this generous donation. We are very thankful for Mrs. Baker’s support of the SCTC and the continual in-depth learning of our students.”
