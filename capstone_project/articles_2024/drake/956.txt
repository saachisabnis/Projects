An announcement to the Castle Valley Property Owners Association board of directors 40 years ago caused a major commotion among some Castle Valley residents.



Ron Drake
The uproar arose when a representative from Oilind Safety of Evanston, Wyoming revealed that Conoco would be drilling an exploratory well near the bottom of Pace Hill not far from the road to Castle Valley.




The spokesperson explained that the drill rig, which was capable of drilling to a depth of 18,000 feet, would be located on a 2.5-acre site about a mile up the Pace Hill Road from Highway 128 and east about a quarter-mile. He added that the drill rig would probably not be visible from the road except for possibly the top of the derrick. They said the exploratory well was looking for natural gas that was suspected to be in the area.



He said traffic might be impacted as they move the rig to the prepared site. It required up to 60 truckloads to move the drill rig over five days. He said that after the site was completed, only minimal traffic would be observed afterward. Oilind Safety was one of the numerous sub-contractors on the site and their responsibility was to monitor the hole for gases and other safety-related projects.



Since the announcement was made near the end of December 1984, the conversation spilled over into the new year. In January, folks from the Bureau of Land Management and Conoco met with the citizens to explain the project and the BLM district manager said written comments would be accepted until the end of the month and a decision on the project would be made the following month.



Several issues were raised by the residents at the meeting, as expected, including noise pollution that would be produced from the operation of the rig. It was feared that the noise would disturb dairy animals and poultry. Others charged that the lights from the site would reflect from the walls of the mesa and create additional annoyance. The exploratory well controversy probably spurred the Castle Valley Incorporation Committee to work even faster toward a Castle Valley municipality. One person stated that a municipal town would have more “clout” to argue against the exploratory well project.



The chance of escaping deadly gases was another issue addressed by those who attended the meeting, stating that the unpredictable wind currents in the area could carry the gasses into the valley. The Conoco representatives said they have monitors in the well to detect gases before they become a problem and can maintain control but admitted that they couldn’t absolutely guarantee safety. One Conoco representative said he never worked with an escape plan when that subject was brought up.



The following month the BLM approved the plans for the wildcat well to be drilled at the base of Parriott Mesa but the approval was contingent upon Conoco’s presentation of a hydrogen sulfide evacuation plan. As a result, Conoco’s representative met with the Castle Valley Fire Department to discuss evacuation procedures before presenting a plan to the BLM for approval. He also demonstrated to the fire members how a well functions and the safeguards installed on the wellhead.

The plan involved the Grand County Sheriff’s Office, the Castle Valley Fire Department, Conoco employees, and the BLM, which would simultaneously notify residents, control traffic, and direct residents to a safe location. Helicopters including medical helicopters and ambulances would be put on standby or dispatched in the event of a blowout. All entities had specific duties. At the time of the Property Owners Association meeting in April, the well was at the 5,532-foot level.



In the end, the project was completed without incident and the rig was dismantled and moved to another location. Life in Castle Valley didn’t seem to be disrupted from normal and the noise or light pollution was not evident. On a still night, I could occasionally hear the clanking of drill pipes if I were outside. Once early in the project, the Pace Hill Road was closed for a few minutes when rock was blasted in preparation for the drill site and the road leading up to it. The drill site was restored to its original contours and replanted and the well was capped. It is unknown if natural gas was found in the over 1,500-foot hole but there has been no activity at the location since. 



While the exploratory well was concluding work, the association organized a meeting to meet with officials of Seis-port Explorations and the BLM regarding proposed seismic activity through Castle Valley. The purpose of the seismic testing was to determine the extent of some specific material for their client AMMACO.



Since they couldn’t drill blasting holes within a quarter-mile of water wells and structures, they planned to run cable and geo-phones over the side of Porcupine Rim and through the valley to the other side, drilling and blasting on both ends. The work was carried out with little effect to the residents and the blasting in the 60-foot holes was undetectable.
