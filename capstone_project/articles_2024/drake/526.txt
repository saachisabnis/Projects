	Bracero’s sister set up a GoFundMe after the news to raise money for a funeral and to transfer their bodies back to their hometown of Chicago. At the time of publication, nearly $40,000 has been raised. “Lety was a hard working regional supervisor at Wintrust bank and a dedicated mother, loving sister, niece/cousin,” the description reads. “Her only child Alyssa was going to college and working part time for Starbucks. Alyssa loved music concerts and although was old enough to travel to concerts on her own, her mom would always escort her. The two were inseparable and shared a strong bond.”
