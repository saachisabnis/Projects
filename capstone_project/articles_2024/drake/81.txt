If you’re looking for the perfect date-day spot in Dubuque, look no further than Roses & Berries Cafe. Tucked away at 4340 Asbury Road, this charming café is an absolute hidden gem where French elegance meets Mediterranean flavors.
Opened in November of 2023 by experienced chefs Yaman Salem and Marzieh Shahrivar, Roses & Berries was created with a goal of bringing Syrian warmth and French elegance to Dubuque’s culinary scene. Whether it’s a casual breakfast, an indulgent lunch, or a special celebration, this café delivers an unforgettable dining experience.
When my wife and I visited to celebrate our 15th anniversary, we were blown away. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by an enchanting atmosphere—think blooming roses, soft natural light, and an ambiance that made my wife feel like she was at an extravagant tea party. Trust me, this is a place that will leave any woman smiling.
The food? Incredible. I ordered the Gyro Wrap, which featured tender slices of gyro wrapped in lavash bread with fresh onions, tomatoes, and cool tzatziki sauce. The fries were perfectly crisp, rounding out a fantastic meal.
My wife went for the Mediterranean Grilled Cheese Panini—sourdough bread with sundried tomato pesto, fresh mozzarella, basil, and a fresh, vibrant side salad. Every bite was packed with flavor.
To complement the meal, we sipped on some of the most unique drinks we’ve ever had. My wife adored her Hot Honey Lavender Matcha, and I couldn’t get enough of the cool Earl Grey Lavender Lemonade—a refreshing and perfectly balanced treat.
And then came dessert. You can’t leave Roses & Berries without trying something sweet. From delicate macarons to rich eclairs and cheesecake, their pastry selection is a masterpiece.
My wife and I shared a couple; she opted for an "apple" dessert. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but it was creamy inside and filled with cinnamon apple compote reminiscent of an apple pie. I, on the other hand, went for a classic lemon meringue tart, and it was great.
We were stuffed, so we didn't eat them right away. Instead, we whisked them away for an evening with some wine in front of the fireplace.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect day.
Beyond the food and drinks, Roses & Berries Cafe has something that makes it truly special—purpose and heart. The owners honor their values and heritage through this café, celebrating community, connection, and the beauty of new beginnings. It’s more than a dining spot—it’s a place where people come together to relax, chat, and make memories.
The café is open:
They also offer catering services for special events like weddings or family gatherings. While you’ll need to visit in person to plan catering (no phone or email orders), it’s worth the trip to experience their dedication firsthand. And, for those busy days, you can also call in pick-up orders — a lifesaver when you need a delicious meal on the go.
Opened just over a year now, Roses & Berries Cafe has already become a must-visit eatery in Dubuque. Whether it’s for a date, a celebration, or just a decadent meal with someone you love, this place has it all: fabulous food, creative drinks, irresistible desserts, and a charming, whimsical atmosphere. My wife loved it—and for me, that’s the best reason to keep coming back.
So, take the time to experience this hidden gem for yourself. You’ll leave with a full stomach, a happy heart, and a date-day memory you won’t soon forget. I know I did.
