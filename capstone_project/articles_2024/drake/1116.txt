The Houston High School volleyball team defeated Dixon in straight sets at Tiger Fieldhouse Monday night.
The Lady Tigers made quick work of the Lady Bulldogs – 25-18, 25-18, 25-7. “It was a great team win and a great start to a four-match week,” said HHS head coach Julia Sloan. The Lady Tigers (18-10-3; 1-4 SCA) faced Cabool Tuesday at Tiger Fieldhouse. The team wraps up conference play Thursday (Oct. 17) at Ava. Friday they travel to Conway for their last regular season match.  
 
District play begins Tuesday, Oct. 22 for Houston, who will face Forsyth. The winner will play top-seeded Mountain Grove. District seeds are (1) Mountain Grove, (2) Hollister, (3) Willow Springs, (4) Houston, (5) Forsyth and (6) Ava. Houston hosts the tournament at Tiger Fieldhouse. PLEASANT HOPE TOURNAMENTThe team finished third in the Pleasant Hope Play for Pink Volleyball Tournament on Saturday. In pool play, the Lady Tigers split sets with Lockwood, 25-14 and 23-25; defeated Chadwick, 25-14 and 25-18; and defeated Greenfield, 25-10 and 25-19. That was enough to place them first in their pool and head into bracket play seeded third. In their first elimination match, they outclassed Russellville in straight sets, 25-11 and 25-6. In the semifinals, Marionville proved to be too much, as the Lady Tigers fell 12-25 and 21-25. The team would bounce back, taking the third place match 25-22 and 25-20 against Lockwood – who they split sets with in pool play. “This tournament was really good for us,” said Sloan. “We played really well all day and built a lot of confidence. We also got to see a lot of teams that we usually don’t see. I am really proud of them for battling all day.” Key tournament contributors included junior Kayla Wagner, 36 kills and 9 aces; senior Morgan McKinney, 39 assists; junior Gracyn McNiell, 49 digs; and junior Kynlee Weaver, 6 blocks. GAINESVILLEThe Lady Tigers picked up a nonconference win last Tuesday at home against Gainesville. The team finished the match in straight sets – 25-18, 25-19, 25-13. “Both junior varsity and varsity got it done,” said Sloan. “It was a good night for both teams.” Stat leaders included Wagner, 16 kills; McKinney, 9 digs and 13 assists; and Carli Cummins-Drake, 8 aces. Between matches, the players honored their favorite teachers.
