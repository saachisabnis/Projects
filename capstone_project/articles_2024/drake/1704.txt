Fall into these new and returning shows
It's going to be a very Taylor Sheridan autumn. If the returns of Yellowstone, which is coming back for its final episodes (without its star, Kevin Costner), and the Sylvester Stallone-starring Tulsa King, returning for its second season, weren't enough, the very busy producer is also behind the new series Landman, starring Billy Bob Thornton.
Elsewhere in the fall TV schedule, Ryan Murphy is similarly having a busy season with the premiere of his new horror series Grotesquerie, while his anthology Monster is getting another installment with Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. Coming down the blockbuster movie-to-TV pipeline, Colin Farrell is set to reprise his role from 2022's The Batman in The Penguin, while Denis Villeneuve's Dune films are getting a shiny new spin-off series in Dune: Prophecy. We're also buzzing about the returns of some of our favorites — like Heartstopper, What We Do in the Shadows, and Somebody Somewhere — while looking forward to original new shows like How to Die Alone and Nobody Wants This. It's going to be a very busy fall season, so we've gone ahead and curated a list of the shows we're most excited about.
Below, you'll find our preview of the best shows to watch from September through November.
