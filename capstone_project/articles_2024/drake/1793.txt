HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - People in Sumner County spent the night praying for Sebastian Wayne Drake Rogers to be found during a vigil held at Long Hollow Baptist Church Tuesday night.
People were scared, and frustrated and have been praying for some sort of answers.
“I just don’t understand how a child just disappears into thin air, I just don’t get it,” Kenny Burd, a friend of the Rogers family, said.
Rogers is an autistic 5′5″ teenager who city, county, and state agencies have spent nearly two days scouring Sumner County to find.
“It’s just sad, you know it’s just sad,” Burd said.
Police said Rogers walked out of his Shackle Island community home Sunday night carrying a flashlight and wearing a black sweatsuit.
“These people are like my family, I mean literally they’re like my family, so I directly feel this completely,” Burd said.
Tuesday night neighbors and church leaders spent hours praying for Sebastian to be found. Rogers’ parents said he loves playing hide and seek so police are telling people to look in small spaces.
“We can only attempt to imagine what they are walking through, so we’ll pray especially for them,” Long Hollow Baptist Church Pastor of Member Care Abraham Cremeens said.
While police search through yards, sheds, and trees, neighbors are offering their help.
“We’re going to do everything we can do as a community to support the family and the first responders,” Burd said.
Burd and his neighbors offered to help search and lift up prayers while fighting back against the feeling of helplessness.
“You hear about this stuff on TV but you don’t think it’s going to happen in your own backyard,” Burd admitted. “It’s just, I don’t know...it’s awful.”
The Sumner County Sheriff’s Department said they’ll search until Rogers is found.
