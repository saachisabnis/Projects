First Dates is back on Channel 4 tonight (Tuesday, August 6), with more single hopefuls looking for love in front of the cameras. Maitre d' Fred Siriex and his team are ready to ensure the blind dates run smoothly, provide some words of wisdom to anxious diners or simply wince at an uncomfortable date.
Joining Fred will be bartender Merlin Griffiths and waitress Cici Coleman, along with waiting staff including Aoife Smyth, Kofi Yeboah-Mensah, Francesca Martusciello and Jamie McCleave.
First Dates has travelled across the country, filming in various venues, but has found a new home in the heart of Bath city centre for its last two series. It's a stunning restaurant that will make you want to visit and plan a weekend getaway in one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the country.
Here's where the First Dates restaurant is situated and how you can reserve a table there.
First Dates is currently filmed at The Botanist Bar and Restaurant in the heart of Bath city centre. Situated on Milsom Street, the venue is housed within the Grade II-listed Octagon Chapel, built in 1766 and known to have been visited by Jane Austen.
The 8,000-square-foot bar and restaurant boasts three entrances, each as pristine and splendid as the next. First Dates star Merlin Griffiths, who has been a mixologist for over 20 years, is a big fan of what's on offer.
The Botanist, which opened its doors in 2019, boasts an 8,000 square foot bar and restaurant, offering a unique cocktail menu alongside craft ales and beers. Upon entering through one of the entrances, visitors are greeted by a stunning tunnel of plants before stepping into the main oval bar area.
The interior design is exquisite, with beautiful lighting that creates an inviting atmosphere.
The Octagon, where The Botanist is located, has a rich history in Bath. Constructed in 1766 as a private chapel, it served this purpose until the late 19th Century.
It then transformed into one of Europe's most renowned antique shops, Mallet and Sons.
Throughout WWII, the building functioned as a rations dispensary and air raid wardens building, and later as a photographic gallery. During the refurbishment of The Botanist, the team worked closely with local heritage experts to preserve the historical fabric of this important Bath landmark, using specialist paints and materials.
Bath, recently named the UK's most romantic city, is also considered one of the most beautiful due to its impressive 18th-century architecture, the stunning Roman Baths, and picturesque views all around.
The menu is diverse, featuring everything from steaks and burgers to hand-crafted pies and salads. The Botanist's own hanging kebabs, vegetarian and vegan options, and a Sunday roast menu are also available. You can view the menu through this link. 
For those who love cocktails, The Botanist offers an extensive range of cocktails, craft beers and ales. They also host gin masterclasses led by their expert bartenders.
The establishment has garnered a commendable four-out-of-five rating on Tripadvisor, with an array of positive reviews hailing the quality of the food and service. A satisfied patron shared their experience saying: "Amazing - We went to this restaurant for a birthday meal when away for the weekend in Bath. This place is so aesthetic, amazing for photos and a beautiful place to eat."
"The hanging kebabs are delicious, we were served by a lovely lady who gave us a free drink for my boyfriend's birthday! (Very sorry I can't remember her name) we had the Korean chicken to start and both agreed it's by far the best starter we've ever had anywhere! Will definitely return!".
In another heartwarming review, someone penned: "We came for our anniversary and were greeted with welcoming staff..lea served us and was amazing with knowledge of the menu and a fantastic service style."

Many may wonder about other filming locations of 'First Dates'. Initially, Paternoster Chop House, part of DandD London, situated near St Pauls, played host to the first 15 series.
Subsequently, the production transitioned to the North, specifically The Refinery Spinningfields in Manchester, previously operated by Drake and Morgan, until it shut down in 2021.
