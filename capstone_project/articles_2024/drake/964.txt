It appears winter is about to set in for most of North Dakota and some parts could see heavy snow.
A low-pressure system, which is still down in Kansas at the time of this article, is expected to work its way north and begin affecting North Dakota by late Monday night.
There will be some powerful northwest winds on the backside of this system which could cause some patching blowing snow and travel problems for some.
Parts of North Dakota could see heavy snow, up to 8 inches, while other parts may see mostly rain and only a coating to an inch of snow.
According to the National Weather Service, a Winter Storm Watch has been issued for much of north-central North Dakota.
From 9 am, November 19th to 6 pm November 20th.
This includes the counties of Bottineau, Rollette, McHenry, Towner, Ramsey, Benson Cavalier, and Pierce.
This includes the cities of Devils Lake, Rugby, Velva, Rolla, Drake, Rollette, Langdon, Maddock, Bottineau, and Minnewauken.
Heavy snow is possible in this area of  North Dakota with 5 to 8 inches expected with locally higher amounts in the Turtle Mountains.
Impacts in the watch area include slippery road conditions, areas of blowing snow, and reduced visibility.
What can we expect in the Bismarck Mandan Capital Region?
Rain will develop after 3 a.m. early Tuesday morning, and it will be very windy. The rain will change to snow by 9 a.m. tomorrow.  Accumulations are expected to be light on Tuesday, only a half an inch.
More snow will linger into Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. Any snow we receive will be blowing around with northwest winds of 25 to 45 miles per hour.
Colder temperatures will follow this system and any snow we receive will stick around for a while as high temperatures will remain in the 20s with low temps in the teens for the rest of the week.
In the meantime, enjoy one last warm today with highs near 50 degrees in Bismarck today.
