Drake‘s Hip Hop credentials have been called into question by Glasses Malone after he complained about news helicopters circling his home.
The 6 God called out local Toronto news station CP24 on social media earlier this weekend, saying their helicopter flights over his mansion were keeping him awake.

“@cp24breaking news can we discuss the chopper flight times over the house cause I won’t lie I’m trying to sleep,” he wrote. “Anytime after 3pm works great for me.”
Drake’s Bridle Path mansion, known as “The Embassy,” had been a firm fixture in the news after being targeted by several trespassers, as well as a drive-by shooting that seriously injured a security guard.

After catching wind of his complaint, L.A. rapper Crip Glasses Malone added to the anti-Drake sentiments emanating from the West Coast by claiming the rap star is “not Hip Hop.”
Responding to a post on X about Drake’s complaint, Malone wrote: “reasons you’re not hip hop #102 u know how many nights we had to sleep with helicopters flying over the crib ??”

After his bold statement caused a stir, the former Crip — who has collaborated with Drake’s fierce rival Kendrick Lamar in the past — dedicated several posts defending his stance.
When one user pointed out that Drizzy was most likely joking about the helicopters, Malone wrote back: “it’s all jokes […] except the part of him not being hip hop.”

Responding to another person who told him: “Hip hop don’t mean ghetto uncivilized people,” the Glass House MC bluntly replied: “of course it does lol.”
Glasses Malone also argued his case by pointing to Ice Cube‘s 1993 song “Ghetto Bird,” named after the “punk-ass” police helicopters that would patrol the skies over low income neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
it’s all jokes except the part of him not being hip hop 🤣

Despite Malone’s harsh comments — and the larger conversation around Drake’s legacy following his perceived defeat to Kendrick Lamar in their recent rap battle — the Canadian has no shortage of co-signs from some of Hip Hop’s forefathers.
Speaking to HipHopDX at the Grammy Awards earlier this year, Grandmaster Flash praised Drake’s versatility as a rapper while arguing that he does belong in Hip Hop.

“What I admire about Drake is he’ll rap on all different styles of beats,” the 66-year-old said. “And back in the day, when I was DJing and cutting and a rapper was in front of me, he was rapping on all the beats I played!
“Sometimes, the beat was jazz, sometimes it was pop, sometimes it was rock, sometimes it was blues, sometimes it was R&B, sometimes it was disco.”

He continued: “So I think the kaleidoscope of music that he’s doing — his style — is absolutely excellent. This is why he’s so big! Because he’s not just staying on one particular style of beat; he’s rhyming on everything and that’s dope.”
Flash’s comments came after Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) called Drake a “pop” artist whose music is “compatible with shopping.”
