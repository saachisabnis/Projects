Fans are convinced Pharrell Williams tapped into his inner "Gru" to shade Drake on his new song. On Friday, June 14, the revered artist and fashion designer dropped his new song "Double Life" fresh off the soundtrack for the upcoming film Despicable Me 4. On the song, the Skateboard P appears to narrate the "double life" of the main character "Gru." Although he makes obvious references to the family comedy, some fans believe his lyrics could have a double meaning. "Lie detector time/Do you feel bad when you lie?" Pharrell raps. "The look on your face says the best life/And then come home like it's fine, am I right?"
"So what have you done?/Some of your dirt has come to light," he continues. "Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off?/And someone saw you in a fight, am I right?"Pharrell Williams and Drake have been at odds since the Toronto native took shots at Pusha T during their infamous beef back in 2018. Since then, Drizzy has taken advantage of every opportunity to diss Williams from buying the Virginia legend's signature jewelry and flashing it off in his "Jumbotron S**t Poppin' music video to claiming he melted down said jewelry in his verse on Travis Scott's "Meltdown" last year. "I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss," Drake rapped on the track. Earlier this year, Drake mentioned P by name on his diss track aimed at K. Dot, "Family Matters." On that song, Drizzy shamed Lamar for defending Williams on his track "Euphoria." "You wanna take up for Pharrell?/Well come get his legacy out my house," Drake rapped. Fans noticed the lyrics on Pharrell's new song, and instantly tried to make it seem like he used it to respond to Drake. One fan hilariously thought P enlisted the minions to fire back at Drake while another downplayed the response. Listen to the song and see more fan reactions below.
