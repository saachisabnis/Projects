Megan Thee Stallion isn't worried about being the subject of diss tracks and snide remarks in songs by other hip-hop artists. 
In a new cover story with Billboard, the 29-year-old rapper shared how she feels about other rappers namedropping her in diss tracks. Artists like Nicki Minaj, Drake and Eminem have all reportedly taken swipes at the "Cobra" hitmaker in some of their own songs, but Meg only sees it as a compliment, per People. 
"I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. If people feel like I'm somebody to aim at, then I must be pretty high up if you're reaching up at me. I must be some kind of competition," she said. "That makes me feel good. That makes me feel like I could rap because if I wasn't the s---, y'all wouldn't be so worried about me."
The "Savage" rapper said she's been working on setting boundaries after putting other people's feelings above her own earlier in her career.
"Everything was about making other people smile and other people happy. Now I'm in a space where I want to be happy," she said. "I'm not going to take away [from] being happy so I can put other people's life and happiness as a priority over mine."
Elsewhere in the interview, Meg directly addressed her alleged beef with Minaj and whether they could reconcile, telling the outlet that she still doesn't understand where the animosity came from. 
"I still to this day don't know what the problem is," she said. "I don't even know what could be reconciled because I, to this day, don't know what the problem is."
