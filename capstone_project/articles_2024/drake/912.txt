Rick Ross reportedly got into a scuffle with an angry mob in Canada, and it was all caught on video. On Sunday night, June 30, the rapper-entrepreneur wrapped up a show in Vancouver and walked off stage as Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" blared through the speakers. TMZ obtained video of the altercation, which began once Rozay was on the side of the stage. Sources told the outlet Ross and his crew were surrounded by nearly 15 men who didn't let anyone move from the area. After an intense verbal exchange, the main dude talking to Ross threw the first punch toward the rapper's head. 
That's when the melee went down. People from both groups started fighting each other, but it's not clear where Ross was during the battle. In other videos posted to social media, you can see one man from Ross' crew get pummeled by several others. There's no confirmation about the extent of Ross' injuries, if any, nor is there word on the status of the other people who were with the rapper during the fight. Both groups were eventually split up and everyone left the venue. As of this report, no arrests have been made. Neither Ross nor anyone from his crew has spoken on the situation yet, however, it looks like Ross' foe Drake has weighed in on the altercation. Drizzy appeared to "like" a post featuring footage of the fight on Instagram.
