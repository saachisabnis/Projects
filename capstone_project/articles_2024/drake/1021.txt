The Patriots 2024 schedule is here.
On Tuesday, the league announced this year’s league calendar for all 32 teams. The Jerod Mayo era officially kicks off on Sept. 8 when the Patriots travel to take on the Cincinnati Bengals.
Mayo’s first game as the Patriots head coach will see his defense tested against quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Mayo’s first game inside Gillette Stadium will be in Week 2 when the Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in their home opener on Sept. 15.
The Patriots are on the road for three of the first four weeks of the season. After their home opener, they take on the New York Jets in a Thursday night matchup in Week 3 followed by a trip to San Francisco in Week 4.
This year, they have another international game as they’ll take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in London on Week 7. That’ll be played inside Wembley Stadium. Unlike last year, the Patriots won’t get the following week off after their trip abroad.
This Patriots 2024 schedule also features the latest Bye Week in the NFL. The Patriots won’t get a break until Week 14, which is the latest week NFL teams can have a bye. Last season, the Patriots had the week off after their trip to Germany in Week 11.
Although we don’t currently know who the Patriots starting quarterback will be between Jacoby Brissett and Drake Maye, the team’s defense will still have a lot of work to do. This Patriots schedule features a laundry list of talented quarterbacks.
They’ll face Burrow (Week 1), Aaron Rodgers (Week 3 and 8), Tua Tagovailoa (Week 5 and 12), C.J. Stroud (Week 6), Trevor Lawrence (Week 7), Caleb Williams (Week 10), Matthew Stafford (Week 11), Anthony Richardson (Week 13), Kyler Murray (Week 15), Josh Allen (Week 16 and 18), and Justin Herbert (Week 17).
The Patriots wrap up their season playing the Buffalo Bills in two of their last three games. They’ll take on their AFC East counterparts in Week 16 in Buffalo and finish the season at home against the Bills in Week 18.
