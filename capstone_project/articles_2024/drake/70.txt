Exploring the outside world has really become my thing over the years. Adventures in the Rockies, Palo Duro, the Smoky Mountains, South Dakota, Pictured Rocks and many others, including all across our great state of Iowa. This time my wife and I headed east to Indiana to take on a certain "sandy" challenge, which is located in one of the newest National Parks in Indiana. It just so happens to be the closest one to Eastern Iowa at around 5 hours away (depending on where you start).
That's the 3 Dune Challenge at Indiana Dunes State Park to be precise. It's an exciting and unique adventure for anyone looking to explore the great outdoors! I know I said that this is part of the National Park, and that is semi-correct, as the entire national park surrounds the State Park (where the 3 Dune Challenge is) and continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline of Indiana. That being said, there is a small fee to enter the state park. Once there, this popular hike takes you up and over the three tallest sand dunes in the park: Mount Jackson, Mount Holden, and Mount Tom.

Mount Jackson kicks things off with a steep climb to 176 feet. It might seem a bit daunting at first, but once you start the ascent, the views begin to reward your efforts. The sand underfoot makes the hike a bit more challenging, but that's the point, and all part of the fun.
Next up is Mount Holden, standing tall at 184 feet. This dune is a bit of a workout with its steep incline and shifting sand, but reaching the top feels like a real accomplishment. It's a perfect spot to take a breather and soak in the surrounding landscape. You can also split from the trail here and head straight down another sandy embankment to Lake Michigan.
The final stretch brings you to Mount Tom, the highest of the three dunes at 192 feet. The climb might be tough, but the reward is worth it.
All I can say about the Mt. Tom Dune is stairs...
...lots of stairs.
From the top, you can catch a glimpse of the Chicago skyline on a clear day, which is around 40 miles away across Lake Michigan. The view is breathtaking and adds a touch of magic to the experience.
The 3 Dune Challenge isn't just about the height—it's also about the terrain. The entire trail is sandy, making every step feel like a mini-adventure. The loose sand can be tough on the legs, but it also makes the experience uniquely fun and memorable. It’s a fantastic way to connect with the natural beauty of the dunes and get a bit of a workout in the process.
Don’t forget to pack plenty of water, sunscreen, and maybe even a pair of walking sticks to help with balance. The dunes can get quite hot, and there's not much shade along the way, so being prepared is key to enjoying the challenge.
After conquering the dunes, you can head to the Indiana Dunes Visitor Center to pick up a free 3 Dune Challenge sticker and sign the logbook, marking your achievement. I grabbed a shirt to mark the occasion as well. It's a great way to remember the day and share your experience with other hikers and challenge takers.
Honest opinion, whether you're looking for a fun family outing or a challenging solo hike, the 3 Dune Challenge offers a bit of everything. It's a beautiful, sandy adventure with a side of stunning views and a dash of lakeside fun. Speaking of lakeside fun, Lake Michigan was beautiful when we were there, but the waves were way to crazy that day to swim.
Either way, standing on the beach, the cool breeze off Lake Michigan on your face, and the Chicago skyline twinkling in the distance. It's a day well spent, and another amazing place checked off my list.
