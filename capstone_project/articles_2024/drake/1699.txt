Discover your Precursor Legacy. 
Astro Bot is the adorable platformer that’s taking the PS5 by surprise. This early GOTY contender crushed our expectations and turned out to be one of the best little games of 2024 so far, and we’re digging deep to unlock a few of the secrets you’ll want to find. The game is short and sweet, so there’s no reason not to go back and grab all the trophies you missed the first time. And one of those trophies challenges you to find three Precursor Eggs from Jak & Daxter — and they’re all in a level that’s really about Uncharted. 
Let’s go hunting. We also covered where to find all the puzzle pieces and artifact locations in Astro’s Playroom — the game that came free with every PS5. Check out how to get them all in Memory Meadow, SSD Speedway, Cooling Springs and GPU Jungle.
There are three Gold Egg artifacts in Dude Raiding – in Serpent Starway. Finding all three will unlock ‘The Lost Eggacy‘ trophy. The eggs resemble the Precursor Eggs from Jak & Daxter — the game series developer Naughty Dog worked on before the Uncharted series on PS3 and PS4.
The first egg is inside that secret room. 
The second egg is much easier to spot and you’ll likely find it during normal exploration.
Jump to this hidden alcove part-of-the-way up to get the last egg.
