WWE and Sexyy Red were in talks, suggesting potential future partnerships. Consequently, Sexyy Red tweeted her excitement about attending NXT next week, playfully hinting at her intention to perform an RKO. 
Shawn Michaels recently reached out to Drake and Kendrick Lamar during their rap beef suggesting they settle the smoke in the NXT ring. Of course with Michaels offering to mediate. It's no suprise that Michaels is encouraging Sexxy Red to make her WWE debut.
Red tweeted saying, "I can't wait to go to NXT next week y'all, I might RKO somebody [loudly crying face emojis] @WWE #nxt."Â 
After her social media update, a report quickly followed indicating that it was orchestrated in collaboration with WWE to facilitate her greater involvement in the storyline. As predicted, last night (May 20), Sexyy officially announced her upcoming appearance on the May 28 episode of NXT.
