My wife and I like to get out and hike... A LOT. And why not, it's good for you and you get to experience the world around you. This weekend's trip was no exception and a great escape from the daily hum-drum. It's a blast to get out and enjoy all the awesome things that changing seasons bring to our local area.
Since, we're now into what I would fully call spring weather, only summer heat can make the flowers pop at the Dubuque Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. In the meantime though, take a stroll through Marshall Park and enjoy the sites of early spring in the mature woods.
Yes, the Dubuque Arboretum and Botanical Gardens boast some of the most picturesque trails you'll find in Iowa. Wandering through these woods is like stepping into a fairytale. You've got your pick of paths, whether you're into the quiet tranquility of the forested trails or the vibrant explosion of colors in the now-sprouting botanical gardens. With each step, you're surrounded by towering trees, blooming flowers, and the gentle sounds of nature.
These trails aren't just for nature buffs; they're for anyone looking to unwind and recharge. Whether you're out for a stroll, a brisk hike, or just craving some time to clear your head, these trails have you covered. There's something about being enveloped by the forest that soothes the soul.
It's like nature's way of hitting the reset button, leaving you feeling refreshed and ready to tackle whatever life throws your way. So, if you ever find yourself in Dubuque, do yourself a favor and take a walk through these magical woods. Trust me, you won't regret it. There's also a bonus for those of you with younger kids who need to get out of the house. Tell them you can read a story as you walk. The Carnegie-Stout Public Library has a featured story walk there.
Check out the preview below of what is to come as the warm weather brings buds, birds, and bees in abundance. Our local arboretum and botanical gardens are a must-stop for any area resident!
