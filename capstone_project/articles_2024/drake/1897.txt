Lupe Fiasco is firing back at Kid Cudi after Cudder admitted that he once hid from Lupe at a Bape store.
On Friday (Jan. 19), Lupe Fiasco hit up X, formerly known as Twitter, with a scathing diss aimed directly at his longtime foe Kid Cudi. The Chicago MC's scathing remarks come immediately after Kid Cudi admitted during an Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe to hiding in a stock room at a Bathing Ape clothing store the Moon Man worked at before his famed rap career.
"Kid Cudi is a b***h," Lupe wrote in the tweet below. "And continues to be a b***h. Ain't nobody finna bring up he used to work at the Bape Store to diss his b***h a*s for having a regular job before he was a famous b***h with a cool job."
Lupe then sent out an array of other antagonistic tweets aimed at Cudi.
"I honestly caught wind of it scrolling through fan comments," Lupe continued. "And I’m like what the f**k is this b***h talking about now with my name… He hid from me in the bape store back in day because he didn’t want me to use it against him when he got famous??? WHAT?!! Like a job shame?"
He then added, "I wanna beat this n***a up so bad I’m getting a migraine…"
Lupe capped off his X tirade by reminding fans why his hatred for Cudder runs so deep, which can all be viewed in the tweets below.
While Lupe Fiasco has been known to refer to Kid Cudi as a "b***h" many times throughout the past decade, this particular rant arrives in response to an interesting story Cudi told this week. During a sit-down on Apple Music's The Zane Lowe Interview Series on Thursday (Jan. 18), Kid Cudi revealed that while he was an eager artist trying to make his way into the mainstream, he worked in a Bape store in New York City. One day, when Lupe Fiasco entered the lavish retail store, Cudi says he immediately hid out of embarrassment.
"Lupe Fiasco came to the store one day," Cudi recalls in the video below. "I was in the back and they were like, 'Yo, Lupe's here.' I was like, 'Oh, s**t.' Stayed down the stairs, waited until he left. They were like, 'What you down here for?'"
Kid Cudi continues: "I explained it to my dude the same way I explained it to you. I was like, 'Yo, bro, if I get famous one day, I don't ever want this n***a saying like, 'He sold me clothes. You my son.' We can’t have that."
Cudi finished his story by referencing the storied beef between him and the lauded Chicago rapper that Lupe says will never be reconciled.
"If you think about it, he hates me to this day," Kid Cudi points out. "He hates me. So I was right. I was onto something. I sensed something in the universe. I was like, 'F**k this.' I can't have nobody making a diss record like, 'Yeah, you rang me up, muthaf**ka.'"
Despite rising in popularity around the same time, Kid Cudi and Lupe Fiasco's support for each other hit a snag in 2014. The two rappers began trading jabs on Twitter after Lupe said he'd charge his fans $500 for a personalized verse, which Cudi thought was "a bit sketch." Cudi then proceeded to call out Lupe on Twitter by asking Lupe publicly what he was going to do with the money from the fans.
Lupe then officially dissed Cudi during a show in Milwaukee in 2015, and it's been bad blood between the pair ever since.
