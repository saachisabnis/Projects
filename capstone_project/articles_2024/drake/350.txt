#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
Jamey Johnson is bringing his 2024 What a View Tour to the Beaver Dam Amphitheatre.
It's hard to believe that Jamey's getting ready to celebrate his 20th year in country music. It was back in 2005 that he scored his first hit on country radio. His song "The Dollar" nearly cracked the Top 10. It ultimately peaked at #14 on the Billboard Country Chart.
Here's a live version of the song. This will give you an idea of how Jamey sounds live and what you can expect if you come see him Beaver Dam.
Less than three years later, Jamey released what quickly became his signature song- his first and only Top 10 song- "In Color."
That song gained Jamey a legion of fans who remain loyal to the eleven-time GRAMMY-nominee today. This certainly won't be Jamey's first time in the Tristate area.
He was one of the headliners at the 2010 Big O Music Fest in Owensboro and the crowd went absolutely crazy when he performed that song.
Well, now, Jamey Johnson fans here in western Kentucky and southern Indiana are going to get another opportunity to see him live.
Jamey's coming to the Beaver Dam Amphitheatre on Saturday, July 27th as part of the 2024 First United Bank & Trust Concert Series. His special guest will be Drake White!
