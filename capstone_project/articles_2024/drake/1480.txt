Baltimore Sports. Period
Spencer Schultz (@ravens4dummies on Twitter/X) has joined PressBox to share his favorite plays each day.
Ray-Ray McCloud over 27.5 receiving yards.
McCloud had ample opportunity in Week 1 with 24 routes run, seven targets and four receptions. His usage may be more dependent on a negative game script, but I anticipate Atlanta to find themselves in one against a fired up Philly team at night. McCloud was the clear primary slot receiver with Darnell Mooney and Drake London playing on the perimeter.
DeVonta Smith anytime touchdown. DeVonta Smith over 72.5 receiving yards.
With A.J. Brown out, Smith will shine. He’s rarely the emphasis offensively, but when he’s given 10+ targets, he has crossed the 70-yard mark in all but two games. When given 7+ targets, Smith has crossed 70 yards in 21 of 28 games.
Eagles -4.5.
Kirk Cousins is too immobilized and will face a tough Eagles pass rush on the road, unable to use a cadence to keep the Eagles at bay. Bijan Robinson may make enough of an impact to keep it close, but the Eagles defense will overwhelm Cousins, who flounders in prime time games routinely.
