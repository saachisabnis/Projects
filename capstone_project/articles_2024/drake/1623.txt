FORMATION NOTES: Washington stuck with its all-nickel-all-the-time approach, usually showing two deep safeties:
95% of the time one of those safeties would rush up into the box on or just before the snap. Functionally this was a one-high 4-3 but Washington wanted to stay tricky.
SUBSTITUTION NOTES: Michigan had 57 snaps. Skill positions:
Orji got two snaps; Hinton got four as a bonus OL.

Two deep shell from UW and a light box; M runs at it after motioning Loveland across the formation. Looks like there’s a big gap right up the gut but Corum turns it down. Keegan(+1) definitively turned his guy out; Barnhart(+0.5) less authoritative but looks good; Nugent(+0.5) releases direct to a LB. Corum turns this down and hops outside, where Loveland (push) is pinning in a DE. This leaves an unblocked edge guy; Corum(+0.5) is able to feint past him and get a decent gain.

Henderson(+1) pulls around this and ejects the playside DE from the play as he tries to be force. Bredeson(+1) leads out and eliminates a DB; Keegan(+0.5) gets a good open field block as well but I’m nervous about his hand placement as he grabs the guy, probably not a hold but if the guy had spun out easy to see this getting called.

Jones(+1) and Barnhart(+1) double through the playside DT and eventually put him on the ground; Barner is able to release and climb the backside LB. UW squeezes this hard; Barner(+0.5) is able to fight inside EMLOS despite the fact he’s slanting inside; Keegan(+0.5) finds a charging LB. Mullings(+2) actually reads that the gap is between the two Washington players(!), who aren’t in any position to tackle, and hits the second level. There he runs through two tackle attempts and is about to take off when a desperate lunge for his ankle succeeds.

Edwards runs the play design even after it’s closed, running up the backs of his OL. This draws in the S and LB, and when he bounces outside he gets blocks from Barner(+1, very extended kickout) and Henderson(+1, ditto). Then Edwards(+2) is very fast. Replay.

Edwards has to make a quick decision and sees an unblocked LB to the left, so right it is. Back there, Barnhart(+1) is about to release when he sees no one to release to; he stops and cuts off a DE trying to dive inside. Nugent(+1) peels off his double when he sees that DE. OLB is force and gets kicked by Hinton(+0.5) after putting his head down to avoid a block from Loveland that isn’t coming. Loveland(+0.5) locks out a safety. Edwards(+2) makes the cut and then is gone-gone. Weakside LB just buried himself in the line, leading to this giant hole. RPS +2, as Michigan asked UW about gaps and UW failed. Replay.

Loveland(+0.5) gets in the way of an OLB playing outside leverage; Barner(+0.5) cuts off a charging S.

Wilson(+1) does a nice job to stand up a LB and actually fire him outside, but there’s an unblocked LB in the gap; Keegan(-0.5) gets to his kickout but falls so he gets an initial push but that guy is going to shut it down; Corum has to dance around to pick up a few.

This was thrown too far upfield and maybe CJ can lay out if it’s perfect but that’s probably a yard short anyway. (MA, 0, protection 1/1, JJ -0.5)

LB drops out as Loveland motions inside. They try the same pivot route from the one minute drill; LB does not bite and Loveland is covered. JJ bails from a clean pocket and breaks contain but just as he’s clearing the defensive end dude reaches out and gets just enough contact on JJ’s ankle to create a stumble that ends up preventing a throw.

PA sucks up the linebackers and provides the lane for Loveland. JJ has to get it out fast as Jones(-2) is beat clean (looks like he assumes the DE diving inside is stunting and he’ll get help from Barnhart, but Barnhart is engaged). Resulting ball is high and hard; Loveland gets it. The UW safety awkwardly jumps; I can only assume that he thought it was going to go over Loveland. S cannot tackle and Loveland(+1) rumbles a long way. (CA+, 2, protection 0/2, JJ +1)

 Timely!
Indeed. One last little bit to savor before we are forced to put the book back on the shelf.
From what I remember, this game was a lot of thunderbolts early, a frustrating lull in the middle, and then Blake The Inevitable at the end.
Pretty much. Edwards of course had the two thunderbolts. The first was awkward, as he ran into the backs of his OL before exploding outside:
Ironically this helps Edwards score, as a safety and a linebacker both fling themselves into the center of the field once it seems like Edwards commits.
From the skycam you can see the thought process, as Nugent's chip pushes the DT on the left out into the B gap. Edwards sees a big gap there, assumes that DT is going to fill it, and then hits the gas directly up the gut:
His decision point:
You can see the idea of the play and that is what Edwards is running. What he's not doing here is trying to sell anyone a bill of goods about what gap he's going in. This was an issue with the insert iso counters Michigan was running against Maryland and Ohio State: Edwards would run the play without doing enough to sell the opposition on the wrong gap. Here he's running by rote and not reacting to the situation in front of him.
The second touchdown was much smoother; Edwards has his head up and has to make a quick decision since Henderson got jammed backwards:
Here you can see Edwards's helmet evaluating options. Once Henderson gets bulled back he checks left…
…and sees that's no good, so let's check right…
…where there is a truck lane. That's no longer a guy running by rote.
The hope for Edwards in 2024 is that he does need to get in a rhythm and get some confidence, whereupon he will run for many yards and there will be a virtuous cycle. Then Michigan gets Purdue '22 Edwards back and everything is golden.
But what about the blocking? 
The blocking wasn't amazing on either of these plays, but both of them feature lots of gaps and truck holes in the line as Washington just failed to fit Michigan's runs. There are two critical errors on the second one, with a backside DE diving inside to create the truck lane and the weakside LB running himself into the defensive front.
Washington WLB #5 to right
Washington entered this game with an outright bad run defense and got clonked with a quickness.
So while this wasn't a Gameplan Game like Alabama was, there were little tweaks. Michigan's third huge chunk in the first quarter—Michigan's very next play after Edwards TD #2—was another tight bunch, but in comparison to previous tight bunches this one was spread wider and had different personnel. Endzone of the second Edwards TD vs the Corum chunk:
When Michigan puts a bonus OL and Bredeson on the field Washington responds with 5 DL. When the bunch is Barner, Loveland, and Wilson Washington's response is to play it straight up with four DL, one of whom lines up outside of Loveland. Look at this bubble in the line:
Once Jones thumps the DT inside and climbs the guy over Loveland would have to make a heroic play to prevent this from popping off. Meanwhile on the backside of the play, the DT and LB over there are ostentatiously making sure nothing pops out there; the backside DL ends up going upfield of Keegan—he cannot flow or chase at all—and the LB does the same with Nugent.
Result:
Mmm, sequencing.
Why didn't this continue?
Washington started the game playing regular football and got destroyed. They'd show a light box and invariably add a safety to it to make up the numbers, but on the snap their defense looked more or less normal:
This was cover three; the safety to the bottom inserted and Michigan picked up four yards:
Here's the mesh point.
You've got one LB firing but still four yards off the LOS, a second LB reading it out, and the filling safety coming from ten yards.
Washington got repeatedly gashed trying to play it straight up and abandoned that in favor of hyperaggression by the second half. Compare the Corum run above to this one:
Mesh point again:
One linebacker has already buried himself in the line, the corners are vastly more aggressive, and the safety is now at five yards. While this play is successful and thus clipped, there were plenty of runs after the initial outburst that didn't go anywhere, or required running back intervention to get a modest gain. Here Washington appears to have a run stunt on that is designed to blow up power. Watch the Husky DE hammer directly at Keegan:
UW DE #46 to bottom
Keegan has no chance to do better there, Loveland gets cut off, and Edwards ends up looking at this:
Edwards is able to chisel out four yards here on his own. This was the first play of a three and out where Washington was run blitzing on every down. Second down:
I wonder if Bredeson makes enough of that block to spring Edwards for a conversion.
Michigan did strike back a couple of times. Orji had a chunk when he pulled in the face of an end crashing down so hard he'd tackle Mullings, and McCarthy had a similar one:
Michigan also pulled out a zone stretch on short yardage that successfully reached the nose tackle and could have been another long TD but for a mis-ID from Nugent.
Those were all runs, you've noticed. There were vanishingly few attempts to punish this approach through the air. This is nothing new, of course. Many UFRs bemoaned a lack of play action when opponents decided they could not play Michigan straight up. This was part of the pattern. If you set aside Michigan's one minute drill at the end of the first half, Michigan barely dropped back on a standard down after racing out to a 14-0 lead. The first downfield pass on a standard down after the second-and-seven dime to Wilson came in the fourth quarter. It was a waggle to Johnson that was open for an easy conversion but dropped; the next drive started out with a first-down play action on which Loveland ripped off 41 yards.
ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT WINNING A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP?
Not exactly complaining.
WELL THEN WHAT *ARE* YOU DOING
I'm trying to resolve the oddity that was Michigan's aversion to play action. My primary frustration with Lloyd Carr was that he coached every team like he had the 1997 team, and while Michigan's Lloydian approach late in the season worked out for this team it did feel like they were excessively conservative much of the time.
But!
While I got a little frustrated watching this too-predictable middle period of the game, I kind of understand it. Michigan's first passing snap saw McCarthy get hit as Henderson yielded a pressure:
LT #73
Michigan's second PA saw a DT come through unblocked on a stunt; on the third McCarthy took a sack, in part because Henderson forced him to move up in the pocket after not quite losing his block.
Henderson started off the season fairly well on limited snaps but was a sieve down the stretch, with PFF pass pro grades of 47, 54, 25, 38, 17, and 33 from Penn State on. His season number of 45 is grim; PFF has him ceding pressures on 11% of his pass blocks on the season. Barnhart wasn't any better until he moved inside, with a run of 57, 42, 0, and 49 from MSU to Maryland.
The lesson learned from Penn State was that every dropback was an opportunity to get McCarthy blown up, and since we now know that McCarthy almost did not play against Maryland it's reasonable to assume he was in a somewhat fragile state. (Also arguing in favor of this: McCarthy is out for the year after meniscus surgery.)
That's my best explanation of Michigan's aversion to play action—and throwing the ball in general. The pass protection was the shakiest thing about the 2023 team. Since Michigan was good enough to win the national title by grinding down the field the risk/reward tilted towards making your offense less efficient in exchange for a reduced chance of a season-crippling injury to McCarthy.
When Michigan did run play action it was just as lethal as it was against TCU last year:
It was about as infrequent. Probably because Michigan kept getting McCarthy hit. The 41-yarder to Loveland? Yup:
RT #53
So I get it. For most of the year Michigan was playing five guards, and the burning memory of Michigan's first game against quality opposition was disastrous pass protection. I just hope that Michigan's approach in 2023 isn't always the approach, because sometimes you're not going to have the defense to take the low variance, low EV approach on offense.
Do you have some sort of way to summarize this information?
Hmm. Let's see:

Did enough.          
The RPS balanced out, as Michigan's heavy packages and occasional play action offset Washington getting nosy. This wasn't the +12 from the Rose Bowl; it was what it needed to be against a defense that was not able to play Michigan straight up on the ground but did not realize that until it was 17-3.
Look at our darling chungus.
Keegan?
Yeah!
This was a hell of a way for Trevor Keegan to go out. In addition to the optimistic proceeding detailed in the game column, I thought this pull was particularly good:
LG #77 pulling
The awareness to find the gap and the ability to slip into it is real nice. In a similar vein, Keegan was the key block on the crucial McCarthy scramble:
LG #77
And there was the optimistic proceeding. The skycam shows how Keegan's presence does just enough to get the linebacker in a bad spot to tackle Corum:
When not doing +2 things he was churning out a steady procession of solid blocks. Number guy.
This is your last chance to say something, anything about Drake Nugent.
Wait! I've got something. How about our Block of the Week?
C #60
Before the season the practice chatter was that Nugent would get under your pads and sort of violently squirrel at you. I never caught this while charting until the second-to-last play of the national championship game.
Nugent went off in various ways in this game. He snapped a ball too early; he snapped a ball too late. He turned in more positive plays than he did in the previous half-season. NOTICE ME, he cried, and lo: he is noticed.
McCarthy?
Oh, right, him.

This was JJ's most pedestrian outing of the year outside of the two TWP fiestas against BGSU and Maryland. He was not asked to throw a true deep ball—the sail route to Wilson was the closest thing—and largely kept out of trouble. He did rack up four + marks for getting out good balls under pressure. But I barely clipped McCarthy throws because there wasn't a whole lot to discuss.
What about those failed conversions on outs?
Well, okay. Michigan's forays into X and medium conversions did not go well. Michigan had to settle for a field goal after Corum ripped off the 59-yarder when Jabbar Muhammad got a +2 on a route that had no chance:
A fourth and three speed out was also PBU'd, but on this one I think you just have to tip your hat to the defensive coordinator and the linebacker. This is a perfect call perfectly executed:
I don't think either of those are necessarily on the QB; McCarthy could have come off Johnson on the first one and tried to find someone, I suppose. I think there was a rub that was supposed to happen and did not. The second one you just tip your hat.
Items of relevance for 2024?
You will be completely unsurprised to find out that I like what Kalel Mullings was able to do in limited touches. He ground out a first down whilst wearing a 300-pound guy like a cape…
…and then danced through a gap containing two Washington players:
He sells the outside just enough and then cuts into the gap, where he dances through some traffic before running through tackle attempts. Once again I must state that this is a stunning level of awareness for a guy who hasn't been a running back for most of his career, and then I must further state that 240-pound guys do not generally move like that.
We also had two Orji snaps. One was a successful counter GT keep:
I think this read is live because of the next snap, and if so that's a good one. The backside end has eyes only for Mullings. The other notable bit of this play is Loveland getting another excellent block in space.
Meanwhile, play #2:
This is obviously a live read because Donovan Edwards is like WTF after Orji pulls. This read is not a good one because the end is again screaming down the line as soon as Jones pulls; Orji can't follow the play design after the pull and just has to salvage two yards.
Isn't this just more of the same Orji stuff?
I don't think so. Previous Orji runs have usually been just straight up QB power or whatever; this was something more, with (probably) two live reads on back-to-back plays. Notably, those plays threatened both sides of the field; they reminded me of Scott Frost's UCF offense (complimentary!) or Meyer-era OSU. If Orji can get the reads right there is going to be a lot of pressure on defensive backs to make tackles in space.
Okay but he got one wrong.
Yes, and he got it wrong in the way he got any read (that was live) wrong last year: by calling his own number. Among the open questions about Orji is his ability to get the read decisions correct frequently enough for them to be an asset.
One thing he has going for him in this department: Rich Rodriguez wanted the QB to keep if he thought he was going to get four yards. This would be a bad idea if we were talking about JJ McCarthy, but a tank like Orji biasing his decisions towards keeps might be relatively viable.
You got any of them Loveland catches?
Yes; the man is a menace against linebackers:
Giggity.

Not much. The entire OL, JJ, Barner, Wilson, and Johnson are gone.
Hints of live reads. I detect bonafide reads for Orji.
Mullings continues to be dude. His highlighted run is nuts for a 240 pound guy.
Keep Loveland away from DEs and we're good. He's not a plus inline blocker but he is really good in space.

The first run is why Donovan Edwards is going to need to improve if he wants to succeed in the NFL. He's fast enough to outrun college defenders but that is not going to cut it. 
I would not be surprised if Mullings do get more touches than expected as the season goes on because he has better vision and can churn out tough yardage.

He’s going to need to improve his vision if he wants to succeed here. That play should have been dead, and Edwards is lucky he wasn’t tackled after running straight into the nearest lineman. He’s similarly lucky that the Washington defender with an angle collapses inside, or else his bounce would have gotten about 4 yards.
I’ll take it, but damn that one was a fluke.

He did the same against OSU two years ago where he ran into the OL's back but the defenders were expecting him to go to certain hole only to see him go the other way for a TD twice. 
That's partly why Donovan didn't play as much as expected last season where Corum still got the same touches and Mullings taking away touches towards the end of the season. I think coaches got frustrated with Donovan's vision so they put in Mullings in to sub for Corum.

The first touchdown does not strike me as a vision problem, at the moment he makes the first cut, the DT is on the outside half of Keegan and the B gap is effectively closed. The DT is just 2-gapping and once he sees DE commit he is attacking inside. The vision of DE on that play is actually totally fine - he found the open gap at the mesh and attacked it. What DE needs to improve on is setting people up to make those openings bigger, and I think this is where the rhythm comes into play for him. An outside jab before cutting up inside on that play is the next level and seeing as how he got so much better at that in '22 with reps, I think we will see that more

Somehow I never noticed we didn't get a Washington Offensive UFR. Guess I was too busy basking in all the glow of a title to notice lol.

man seeing this made me misty and emotional. what a goddamned glorious football team. the big ten and NCAA tried their best to cause off field shenanigans to blunt them. and they went out and proved they were the best big ten team in a generation, if not ever.
what a team. what a season. what a game. kiss the rings, pettiti.

What does it say about the offensive tackles on this year's team when none of them could get much playing time last year? I am worried about the offensive line

It says that there’s a decent chance that Michigan will actually be improving at offensive tackle this season, perhaps considerably.
Trente Jones was a lot better than Barnhart last season.  The fact the coaches started Barnhart instead didn’t actually mean that Jones couldn’t play.  And this season, Hinton and Persi and Gentry all have an additional year’s worth of experience, which might well prove to be of considerable value for some or all of the three.

I agree.  Last year they had a ton of seniors and two transfers that essentially had to play...but were all guards.  The biggest question last year is what they saw in Barnhart over Jones at tackle.  The guys this year:
I'm a little worried about RT but we at least have 3 options.  Hinton should be solid - though I'm less excited than Brian.  I think it is very possible that Hinton/Crippen/ElHadi/TBD are as good or better than Henderson/Nugent/Barnhart/Jones by the end of the year.  We just won't have Keegan/Zinter on the inside.

I don't think the worries are unwarranted, but remember that Michigan was trying out different options (like Hinton) early in the year last season. And I thought at the time that they were looking for pass protection upside and wound up deciding to go with guys that were more solid in run blocking.
Granted, there were some bad pass pro misses by guys like Hinton too. But that was my impression at the time. 
So it's possible that the OL has a different sort of mix of performance levels. Granted, if Orji packages are the primary or a significant factor, pass pro still won't get tested much.

I reviewed the tackle battle from the beginning of last season. Kinda grim, honestly; Hinton started but struggled to block the right players in both run and pass situations at times. Henderson got a couple of quarters against Rutgers and Hinton looked poor and that was that (with Barnhardt flipping to RT with Henderson playing). 
One might ask why Trente was not given the same chance. It may have been where he was personally at that point of the season. Or it may have been simply an issue of pass blocking, which was never something Trente got asked to do much after he came in against OSU. By that time Michigan was well-versed in protecting its tackles from getting scorched in pass pro and Trente benefitted from that.
What does it mean for this year? I have no idea. But it's worth remembering that Hinton was initially slotted above Trente Jones on last year's depth chart.

Michigan won the national title, and I just read a play-by-play grading breakdown of the offense winning it. That's really cool.
RE: conservative mid-game, cf PSU and OSU (and, really, Bama): 
I agree with Brian's conclusion completely. Michigan's offense frustrated by not really opening things up, but choosing not to open things up was a rational choice based on an evaluation of game states through the lens of Michigan's strengths and weaknesses. 
It was most obviously visible against Penn State, where PSU's anemic offense against Michigan's generational defense meant that any lead was safe, even without recognizing that Michigan was totally unable to protect JJ McCarthy on dropbacks. 
I believe I read that Michigan finished the season with the best turnover ratio in the country. Refusing to give McCarthy 20-30 dropbacks a game where he could be vulnerable to getting blown up by often elite DEs taking advantage of Michigan's 1 truly ordinary asset--outside pass protection--when your defense and run game is perfectly capable of winning by double digits is completely rational, and a crucial factor in achieving that turnover number. It got frustrating in tight games when the offense levelled off for significant periods, but those were also the game where a strip-sack could be the key event that flips the field position and the score, and suddenly Michigan is trailing OSU in the second half or down 10 to Alabama and you have to drop McCarthy back.
It was the one element of the season that was not as aesthetically pleasing as it could have been, but the result was a perfect record, three of the biggest wins in program history, a bunch of huge blowouts against mere mortal teams, a national championship, and the most fun I have had watching a football season ever.
I'll take it.

Amen to that… The best proof of a strategy panning out is the end result. 15-0! Best season ever in Michigan history and no one can take that away (alternate universes be damned)

Watching them crush the will out of every opponent was very aesthetically pleasing.  It's just a different aesthetic. :)

You know what was aesthetically pleasing? Us holding the NC trophy and celebrating!!
What we did makes sense through the lens of "JJ is half-hurt and we can't get him all the way hurt......."

Love me some UFR on a Thursday!!  Glorious!  
I guess I understand the play-action theory about JJ getting hit....but still seems almost criminal that we didn't exploit it more with the ground game we had.  Our extreme tendency almost makes play action even more effective. 
I have concerns about our QBs and their ability to do the basic stuff consistently without turnovers.  But that concern is magnified by the fact that our coaches have never seemed to be comfortable with running the QB or implementing some of the creativity to the offense that will be critical for Orji this year.  We have swiss army knife players...can we find ways to use them?  Can Orji get the ball to them?  Going to be interesting to find out....

I am frustrated we did not score a TD after Blake's long run in the 2nd quarter.  Call it conservative or soft we must be stronger and have that killer instinct to put teams away early in order to compete with the Alabama's and Ohio St....   oh wait

I will also try not to complain about winning the national championship...but we didn't have to make it as hard as we did by being allergic to play action. Even if the pass pro is eh, seems like some quick PA outs, flares, etc. would've done enough to keep opponent's linebackers and safeties from blindly running at the LOS. Michigan's offense was just so predictable at times and it didn't need to be

By now we have all hypothetically UFR’d this game in multiples…but, it is wonderful to see the exact same interpretation from the experts here.
FWIW - I also initially had called both Donovan's TD ‘duo’ - I even said that it was almost Trio with the open lanes live - or maybe it was just the second one lol - I also love months later that I can’t remember which was which… 
Inside Zone or Duo - it don’t matter with a OL that came down hard to embarrass a touted D that practiced against the 2023 “Joe Moore“ award wining OL - cough, cough - run Don run…..maybe invest in more Tight Ends….just saying…and also - welcome to the B1G.
