The fire which started on April 21st destroyed the Kennewick cold storage warehouse, adjacent to Finley. Crews have been on the scene tearing down and hauling debris away rom the site for several weeks. Lineage officials say cleanup will continue for many more weeks.
The Benton Franklin Health District, WA State Department of Ecology, and WA State Department of Health continue to monitor the air quality. Due to smoke from the fire, the air quality has been poor at times. The BFHD plans to test water in the area for possible toxins and e-coli.
The event starts at 6 pm at River View High SchoolÂ (36509 S. Lemon Drive, Kennewick).
People who live near the fire site are encouraged to stop by for masks, box fans, box fan filters, air purifiers, and air purifier filters.
Officials say that discussion will take place after cleanup is completed. Employees of the Kennewick warehouse were offered positions at other locations.
