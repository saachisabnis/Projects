Nicki Minaj plans to release a brand-new installment of her Pink Friday album series. On Sunday night, September 15, Minaj announced that she ditched her plans for another Gag City edition of Pink Friday 2. Instead, she's preparing to drop Pink Friday 3 with a fresh batch of hits that is "just too good to be thrown away on a deluxe album." "Last night, the songs I recorded were just way too iconic," she wrote on X. "I love you guys so much. You know that. I know you do. Iâ€™ll still give you something leading up to the announcement, so no worries."
Minaj initially teased her plans for new music last month ahead of the second U.S. leg of her "Pink Friday 2 World Tour." The next phase, known as "Gag City Reloaded," began on September 6 in Philadelphia and has been hitting major cities nationwide. She tapped BIA, Tyga, and Skillibeng to join her as opening acts. When she revealed the new dates, she promised "New looks, set list changes, other secrets, ummmm new music? ðŸ˜…Lemme think about it." The Queen rapper released the sequel to her debut album on her birthday last year. The original project contains 22 tracks including "Everybody" with Lil Uzi Vert, "FTCU" and songs featuring Future, Drake, Lil Wayne, J. Cole plus more. A few months later, Minaj shared Gag City deluxe versions of the album. The first version she shared contains "Beep Beep" with 50 Cent and "Love Me Enough" featuring Monica and Keyshia Cole. She also debuted a PLUTO edition with her second Future collaboration, "Press Play." Minaj performed the songs while she traveled around the globe for her tour. Nicki Minaj hasn't revealed the release date for Pink Friday 3 yet. She plans to announce it within the next few weeks.
