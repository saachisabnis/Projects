Drake has announced that he’s determined to beat the odds — at least when it comes to an upcoming fight, which he’s watching with a lot of interest.
On Friday (March 8) Drake shared a screenshot of his bet on the boxing match between Anthony Joshua and Francis Ngannou, which was scheduled to start at 5:50 PM ET on that same day.

The photo documents that he’d bet $615,000 on Ngannou to win, even though Joshua is a heavy favorite. So heavy, in fact, that the rapper stands to make 3.1 times his money if Ngannou wins, which would mean a payout of just over $1.9 million.
“Betting on a scary man,” Drake captioned his post. He also mentioned Stake, the betting platform on which he placed his wager. See the post below.
According to a 2023 Financial Times article, the rapper is reportedly paid $100 million a year to endorse the online casino, in which bets are primarily made in cryptocurrency (though the process is a little more complicated in the United States).
The website Casino.org noted in a recent piece that “Many bettors now believe that the money Drake gambles on the site is in fact deposited by Stake itself.” His bets are so big that he wagered cryptocurrency worth over $1 billion in just two months.

The Joshua/Ngannou fight is far from the first high-profile bet Drake has placed using Stake. In January, he bet $700,000 on a UFC championship match.
The following month, there was a $1.1 million wager on the Super Bowl (which he won) — which itself was a follow-up to an earlier seven-figure NFL bet that netted him $2.1 million.

In addition to sports betting, the superstar also plays for big bucks at Stake’s online casino.
Back in July 2022, he had a wild night of roulette with special guest French Montana.

At one point in the night, he won $12.96 million and $11.95 million on individual bets — both on the same number.
“You know what that deserves? Ah haaan!” Drake yelled while celebrating the former. “And I got my special guest in the building, take a seat. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here with my brother, my twin, my lookalike Montega.”

At one point, Drake’s balance reached almost $27.2 million — over triple the $8.5 million he started with — but in the end, it proved to be a brutal night at the table as he finished the event with just $1,879 in his account.
