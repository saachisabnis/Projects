The Pike County Conservation District (PCCD), Wayne Conservation District, and Pike-Wayne Chapter of Trout Unlimited will be holding an educational program titled “Stream Keepers” on Saturday, October 5. This is a free opportunity for kids ages 11-14 and their chaperone(s) to learn about stream health through hands-on activities including fly tying, fly casting, and aquatic macroinvertebrate surveying. Additional youth participants who do not meet the age requirements are welcome to attend with a registered participant but must remain with their chaperone at all times.
This program will take place at the Carlton Drake Memorial Park at 994 Main Street, Newfoundland, Pa., from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday, October 5. Lunch will be provided for all program participants, and registered youth will receive an activity/reflection journal and use of provided stream equipment.
Because space is limited, registration is required and will close when full. Learn more and register online at bit.ly/pccdstream.
