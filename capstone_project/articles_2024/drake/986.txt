A$AP Rocky has seemingly hit back at Drake by taunting him over his relationship with Rihanna on his latest single “HIGHJACK.”
The song, which features singer Jessica Pratt and will appear on his upcoming album Don’t Be Dumb (out August 30), appears to contain several subliminal shots aimed at the 6 God.

In the first verse, Rocky raps: “Fuck your ho ’cause she like that / Yeah, bitch fat ass, pretty, I might wife that / N-ggas swear they pimpin’, Scottie simpin’, get your wife back.”
At the end of the verse, he appears to reference Drake previously being in love with Rihanna: “These n-ggas want my wife bad, the people want my next track.”
A$AP Rocky returning fire at Drake isn’t unexpected after Hot 97’s DJ Kast One revealed earlier this week that the “Peso” rapper has multiple disses lined up on Don’t Be Dumb.
After attending a listening event for the album, Kast One said on air: “I heard A$AP Rocky definitely addressing a lot of the main topics that are happening out there right now. Let’s just say the list keeps going on strong.”

Host Ebro Darden then asked whether “Rocky is still on Drake’s list,” with the DJ responding: “Oh, he’s gonna be cemented on the list after this.”
Drake and A$AP Rocky, once collaborators on tracks such as “Fucking Problems,” have been exchanging disses ever since the Toronto native appeared to throw shade at Rihanna.

On his For All the Dogs song “Fear of Heights,” he rapped: “Why they make it sound like I’m still hung up on you? / That could never be / Gyal can’t run me / Better him than me / Better it’s not me.”
He also seemingly referenced RiRi’s 2016 album ANTI: “I’m anti, I’m anti / Yeah, and the sex was average with you / Yeah, I’m anti ’cause I had it with you / Okay, I’m auntie like your daddy’s sister / Auntie like a family picture / And I had way badder bitches than you, TBH / Yeah, that man, he still with you, he can’t leave you / Y’all go on vacation, I bet it’s Antigua.”

“Rakim talkin’ shit again / Gassed ’cause you hit my BM first / N-gga do the math, who I was hitting then / I ain’t even know you rap still ’cause they only talking ’bout your fit again / Probably gotta have a kid again before you think of dropping any shit again / Even when you do drop they gon’ say you should model cause it’s mid again,” he spit.
He added: “Smoking Fenty ’bout they shoulda put you on the first one you tryna get it in / Ask Fring if this a good idea next time you cuddled in the bed again / She’ll even tell ya leave the boy alone before ya get your head split again.”
