BG Knocc Out returned for another VladTV exclusive with DJ Vlad. The West Coast veteran started by offering his thoughts on Kendrick Lamar and Drake's rap feud. He applauded the battle for creating excitement for Hip-Hop despite criticism for the feud escalating into unverified gossip and mudslinging. This caused BG to reflect on past battles, particularly feuds he was involved in, such as the Death Row vs. Ruthless beef. BG Knocc Out downplayed the seriousness of Eazy-E's feud with Dr. Dre, claiming that there was genuine love between the two despite their public beef. He also responded to various claims in interviews made by Suge Knight before talking about prison dynamics. Throughout the rest of the interview, BG Knocc Out reflected on classic West Coast rap battles and much more.
