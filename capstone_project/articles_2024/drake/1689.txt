Drake Bell, known for his role in Nickelodeon's Drake and Josh, has revealed for the first time that he was sexually assaulted at the age of 15 by Brian Peck, a former Nickelodeon dialogue and acting coach. The revelation came in a documentary called Quiet On Set: The Dark Side Of Kids TV, which explores the emotional abuse by Nickelodeon executive Dan Schneider and the physical abuse by Peck.
"I was just trapped. I had no way out,” said Bell. “The abuse was extensive and it got pretty brutal. I don’t know how to elaborate on that on camera, really…" Although Peck's arrest on charges of sodomy, lewd act, and oral copulation on a child was reported widely in 2003, the child victim had never been identified until now. The doc highlights the importance of seeking help and justice to prevent abuses from continuing.
