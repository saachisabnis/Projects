Here’s how we got here: All parties have thrown shots after Kendrick Lamar went at Drake and J. Cole on his explosive “Like That” verse. Cole has since bowed out. So now, the main event is here, and Drake has answered the call.
On Saturday, Drake’s alleged diss track towards Kendrick Lamar (and half the rap game), “Push Ups,” leaked on social media. While many thought that the track was created using A.I., it was (seemingly) confirmed by the Toronto rapper on social media when he posted a photo to Instagram of Uma Thurman in “Kill Bill,” wielding a sword and fighting a large group of attackers, symbolically representing how he  dissed Lamar and a good amount of others in the song. 
With that in mind, let’s look at every person ( rapper, singer, and athlete ) “The Boy” has dissed over the years.

K. Dot initially called out Drizzy (and many others) on “Control” and later claimed to “tuck him in his pajama clothes” during the 2013 BET Cypher. For the next decade, the two aimed subliminal shots at each other that fans had to decipher. Lamar called out Drake again on “Like That” and the Toronto rapper responded by telling K. Dot to “drop down and give him fifty.”

People may not remember this, but on his 2011 record “Sweet,” the Chicago MC took multiple shots at Drake. Champagne Papi responded properly by hopping Rick Ross’ track, “Stay Schemin,” where he accused the rap veteran of going at him so he could sell records.

There’s not much that needs to be said. Meek Mill accused Drake of having a ghostwriter in 2015 and Drake simply released three songs over the next year in which he went at his entire character — most notably “Back To Back.” But let’s not forget he went for Meek on “Charged Up” and “Summer Sixteen.”

Pusha T baited Drake to pop after he took some light shots at the 6 God on “Infrared.” The Toronto MC then came back with a solid response on “Duppy Freestyle,” where he claimed he was writing for Kanye West and that Pusha wasn’t even top five on his label. We all know what happens next: We discovered Drake was hiding a child and the rest is history.

Although “Duppy Freestyle” was in response to Pusha T’s “Infrared,” he was going at Ye for most of the song.

Drake hasn’t officially gone at Budden on a song, but he has been highly critical of the former New Jersey MC and vice versa. Just last year, Budden criticized “For All The Dogs” claiming that he was rapping for “children” and said that he wanted to hear Drake rap for “adult people. In a lengthy IG comment, Drake went at Budden, saying he “failed at music” and that he was a “failure giving his opinion on his idea of a recipe for success.”

Not one of his more infamous feuds, but it did happen. In 2010, Drake accused the Atlanta rapper of using the “Supa Dupa” flow, which was popularized by Big Sean and used by Nicki Minaj. Luda responded on his “Bada Boom,” rapping, “Counterfeit rappers say I’m stealing they flows, but I can’t steal what you never made up.”

Tyga and Drake were once both signed to Cash Money Records. But in a 2014 interview, Tyga said, “I don’t like Drake as a person. He’s just fake to me.” The Toronto rapper heard the comments, and responded on his 2015 track, “6PM in New York,” where he said, “It’s so childish calling my name on the world stage / You need to act your age and not your girl’s age.” This is a reference to Tyga’s then-alleged relationship with Kylie Jenner, who was 17 years old at the time.

Drake allegedly took shots at Megan Thee Stallion on “Circo Loco,” where he rapped, “This b***h lie ’bout getting shots, but she still a stallion.” In January, fans speculated that Megan responded to Aubrey on her single, “Hiss,” where she said, “These n***As hate on BBLs and be walkin’ ‘round with the same scars.”

The only rapper to respond to Drake’s “Push Ups” so far. On the song, Drizzy rapped, “I might take your latest girl and cuff her like Ricky/ Can’t believe he’s jumping in, this nigga turning 50/ Every song that made it on the chart he got from Drizzy/ Worry ‘bout whatever going on with you and —”
Ross did not waste any time responding to “The Boy” in his response track, “Champagne Moments.”

On “We Don’t Trust You,” Future claimed that Drake was his number-one fan and that he was “sneak dissing’” and “pillow talking.” In response, Drake rapped, “I could never be nobody number one fan/ Your first No. 1 I had to put it in your hand.” This is true: Future’s first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 was, “Way 2 Sexy,” which is Drake’s song from “Certified Lover Boy.”

Drake only needed one line to go at Metro Boomin on “Push Ups. In response, the 6 God simply said, “Metro, shut yo hoe ass up and make some drums, n***a.”
14 / 17
Yes, Drake even went at his fellow Canadian, The Weeknd. On “Push Ups,” Drizzy referred to The Weeknd by his real name, rapping, “Cash blowin’ Abel bread out here trickin’/ Shit we do for b*****s he doing for n****s.”

This might be a stretch since Drake also said “Travis got you wiped down” on “Push Ups.” But on the song he also rapped, “Rolling Loud stage, y’all were turnt, that was slick as hell.” This could be a reference to when Scott performed with Metro and Future at Rolling Loud and told them to play “Like That” for the crowd before “We Don’t Trust You” was officially released.

On “Push Ups,” the Toronto rapper says, “Shoutout to the hooper that be bustin’ out The Griddy/ I know why you mad, n***a, I ain’t even trippin/ All that little heartbroken Twitter shit for b*****s.” This comes from rumors that Ja Morant dated Drake’s ex.
