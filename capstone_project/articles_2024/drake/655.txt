As the NFL regular season nears its conclusion, many teams are turning their focus to the 2025 NFL Draft in hopes of reshaping their franchises. This week‚Äôs NFL Draft Notebook highlights a top 10 mock draft that features two quarterbacks leading the way, and two prospects from both Michigan and Colorado getting drafted.
In addition to the mock draft, this edition previews five key storylines to watch this weekend, including an unusual position of optimism for Carolina Panthers fans. Finally, we dive into the latest draft news and notes, spotlighting an offensive tackle who could be the perfect fit for the Kansas City Chiefs.
While Shedeur Sanders may not be the consensus top player in the 2025 NFL Draft, the Raiders are likely to select him first overall if they retain this pick. The Raiders are in dire need of a competent starting quarterback, and Sanders stands out as the most accurate passer in this class. Additionally, his preexisting relationship with new owner Tom Brady, who views Sanders as a strong leader, could tip the scales in his favor.
The Giants move on from Daniel Jones by selecting Miami‚Äôs Cam Ward, a quarterback with tremendous upside. While Ward may lack Sanders‚Äô polish, his elite arm strength and ability to improvise make him an exciting prospect. He offers the potential to elevate the Giants‚Äô offense to new heights.

Colorado‚Äôs Travis Hunter, widely regarded as the best player in the draft, is too valuable for the Patriots to pass up. Although offensive tackle is a pressing need, Hunter‚Äôs elite ball skills and ability to rack up yards after the catch provide rookie quarterback Drake Maye with a dynamic go-to target, accelerating his development.
The Panthers surprise many by selecting Arizona wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan instead of addressing their defense. McMillan gives Bryce Young the true No. 1 receiver he needs to reach his full potential, solidifying Carolina‚Äôs investment in their young quarterback.
Defense is a priority for the Jaguars, who have struggled mightily this season, allowing an NFL-worst six yards per play and 26.5 points per game, the latter ranking 28th in the league. Michigan‚Äôs Mason Graham, widely regarded as the top defensive player in the draft, has the potential to anchor their defensive line and provide a much-needed boost to their struggling unit.
The Titans opt for Penn State‚Äôs Abdul Carter, a player with elite explosiveness and pass-rushing prowess. Carter, the AP Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, is a perfect fit for a Tennessee defense that averages just 2.1 sacks per game.
The Jets face a major rebuild with a new coaching staff and general manager on the horizon. While quarterback is also a concern, Georgia‚Äôs Malaki Starks fills a glaring need in the secondary. Starks boasts cornerback-level coverage skills and a stellar 88.4 run-defense Pro Football Focus grade.
If Jameis Winston can limit his turnovers, the Browns may have their quarterback. However, their offensive line has been a liability, surrendering 53 sacks this season. Texas‚Äô Kelvin Banks Jr., a Lombardi Award winner, is a durable and agile tackle who has allowed just three sacks in three seasons.

The Bears, who have given up more sacks than any team this season, address their offensive line with LSU‚Äôs Will Campbell. Campbell can start at left tackle, replacing Braxton Jones, or slide inside to bolster the interior line‚ÄîChicago‚Äôs weakest spot.
With a defense allowing 27.7 points per game, the Bengals‚Äô top priority is cornerback. Michigan‚Äôs Will Johnson fits the bill as a shutdown defender when healthy, providing much-needed stability in the secondary.
Chiefs rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy has seen increased involvement in the passing game, hauling in a career-high five catches in each of the past two games. However, the explosive plays Kansas City envisioned when drafting the speedster out of Texas in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft have been elusive. Worthy hasn‚Äôt logged a reception over 20 yards since November 17, and his 3.4-yard average depth of target against the Chargers last week highlights the issue. Watch for the Chiefs to test Cleveland‚Äôs secondary this Sunday by utilizing Worthy‚Äôs speed downfield.
One of the biggest steals of the 2024 NFL Draft has been Louisville cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr., selected by the Tennessee Titans in the fifth round. With injuries sidelining key players like L‚ÄôJarius Sneed and Chidobe Awuzie, Brownlee has stepped into a prominent role, helping the Titans' defense rank first in the NFL by allowing just 176 passing yards per game. This Sunday, he faces his toughest test yet against a Cincinnati Bengals offense that leads the league in passing, averaging 272 yards per game‚Äî12 yards more than any other team.

While the New York Giants are heavy underdogs against the Baltimore Ravens, wide receiver Malik Nabers remains a bright spot. Nabers has been consistently productive, recording at least 60 receiving yards in each of his last three games and is on pace for a franchise-record 109 receptions this season. Facing a Ravens defense surrendering a league-high 265 passing yards per game, Nabers is poised for another strong performance, even if the game‚Äôs outcome seems lopsided.
For the first time in 34 games, the Carolina Panthers enter Sunday‚Äôs matchup as the favorites against the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a significant milestone for a team showing signs of progress, including competitive losses to playoff contenders Tampa Bay (26-23 in overtime) and Philadelphia (22-16) in recent weeks. A win here could further solidify Carolina‚Äôs resurgence.
Colorado‚Äôs Travis Hunter is poised to become the third wide receiver ever to win the Heisman Trophy, joining DeVonta Smith and Desmond Howard. His dynamic contributions on both sides of the ball have electrified college football and solidified his frontrunner status. Meanwhile, Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty is making history of his own, potentially finishing higher in Heisman voting than any Group of Five player ever.
Shutdown Corner: Eagles cornerback Quinyon Mitchell has emerged as one of the top candidates for Defensive Rookie of the Year, showcasing remarkable skill in his debut NFL season. A true shutdown corner, Mitchell has held opponents to fewer than 30 receiving yards in ten games this season. Additionally, he's demonstrated a knack for making plays on the ball, recording 10 pass breakups. This ability was evident during his standout career at Toledo, where he led the FBS with 43 pass breakups over his final two seasons with the Rockets.
Washington delivers in the clutch: Miami Dolphins sixth-round pick Malik Washington played a pivotal role in the team's thrilling 26-23 overtime victory against the New York Jets. In the final minute of regulation, Washington electrified fans with a 45-yard kickoff return, setting up Miami with excellent field position to force the game into overtime. During the impressive return, Washington delivered one of the week's standout special teams highlights by bulldozing Jets kicker Anders Carlson. This redemption moment was particularly significant for Washington, who faced criticism just a week earlier after muffing a punt in the first quarter of the Dolphins' loss to the Green Bay Packers, a game Miami ultimately dropped 30-17. His bounce-back performance should help his chances of making a big impact on special teams down the stretch.

How to fix dumpster fire: The New York Giants hit a new low on Sunday, dropping to 2-11 after yet another frustrating loss. Fans are beyond frustrated‚Äîone even hired a plane to fly a banner reading, ‚ÄúMr. Mara enough - Plz fix this dumpster fire.‚Äù So, how can the Giants turn this mess around? First, they need to focus on drafting a quarterback with their first-round pick, which currently sits at No. 2 overall and carries a 41% chance of landing the top pick. The ideal choice to be the new face of the franchise is Colorado‚Äôs Shedeur Sanders. Beyond quarterback, the Giants must rebuild their offensive line. With their day-two picks, targeting linemen is critical as they currently allow 3.2 sacks per game, ranking 26th in the NFL. Protecting their future quarterback and improving the offense starts in the trenches.

Jets rookie running backs: The Jets have plenty to feel good about when it comes to their rookie running backs. Third-round pick Braelon Allen is leading the rookies with 283 rushing yards on the season. Allen has also contributed as a reliable target in the passing game, hauling in 16 receptions. Meanwhile, fifth-round pick Isaiah Davis has begun to carve out a role of his own. After going without a single carry in nine of the team‚Äôs previous games, Davis stepped up in a big way against Miami last week. He carried the ball 10 times for 40 yards and added three receptions for 27 yards. Notably, Davis has now found the end zone twice in his last two games, signaling a promising uptick in production as the season progresses. Both rookies are proving to be valuable contributors and hint at a bright future in the Jets' backfield.
A glimmer of hope for Chicago: The Bears' season continues to spiral downward, with last week‚Äôs 38-14 loss to the 49ers marking a new low as they managed only four yards in the first half. Yet, amidst the struggles, rookie wide receiver Rome Odunze provided a bright spot. Odunze recorded a career-high two touchdown catches, accounting for all of Chicago‚Äôs points. Showcasing the skills that made him a standout at Washington, Odunze demonstrated his ability to excel in contested situations, hauling in three of his four receptions in traffic, according to Pro Football Focus.
Kansas City Chiefs draft target: Kansas City Chiefs fans should keep an eye on Josh Simmons, Ohio State‚Äôs standout left tackle, as a potential target in the 2025 NFL Draft. Addressing the offensive line with their first-round pick could be a wise move for Kansas City, given that their 7.0% sack rate this season is the highest it has been in the Patrick Mahomes era. The need for a reliable left tackle is evident. Both Wanya Morris and rookie Kingsley Suamataia have struggled in pass protection, earning Pro Football Focus (PFF) grades of 54.2 and 33.2, respectively. Meanwhile, Simmons has been stellar in pass protection over the past two seasons, surrendering just one sack and boasting an 86.7 PFF grade this year. Simmons could be available late in the first round due to concerns over his recovery from a torn ACL. If healthy, he could be the long-term solution to protect Mahomes and solidify the offensive line.
