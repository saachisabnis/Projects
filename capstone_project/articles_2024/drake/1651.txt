There are a lot of hidden gems in Oregon, but from what I’ve seen in pictures and videos, Wallowa Lake is a keeper!
Note to self: Keep Wallowa Lake in my future must-see Oregon road trips!
1 . People love to get married at Wallowa Lake Lodge; it’s quite the scenic spot to get married.
2 . People love to hike in Wallowa Lake. The views are breathtaking, especially in late Spring and early Summer.
3 . People love to paddleboard in Wallowa Lake. Just slather on your sunscreen, pump up your little inflatable and hit the water. (I will be the one wearing a giant life jacket.)
One visitor even calls it the “Switzerland of Oregon.”
