Bloktoberfest 2024 brought the Dubuque community together in a big way on Saturday September 14th, 2024, filling the Historic Millwork District with energy, excitement, and plenty of good vibes. This year’s festival, which ran from noon to 5 PM, offered something for everyone, from thrilling action sports to family-friendly fun, contests, and unique local experiences, food, and brews.

The highlight of the day? BMX, skateboarding, and pro scooter contests by Olliewood Action Sports that wowed the crowd with incredible tricks and gravity-defying stunts. The addition of a Women’s Skate Contest was a big hit, showcasing the talent and creativity of female skaters during the she-skate event.
But the fun didn’t stop there. Families enjoyed the Play Zone, face & mural painting, goat petting zoo, beer yoga, and a tug-of-war challenge that brought out everyone’s competitive spirit, and almost ran over my broadcast table (those boys were getting after it). The Sustainable Fashion Show, featuring Project Runway's Danielle Everine, added a stylish twist to the day, while a dance exhibition by Adam’s Dance Connection got the crowd moving and grooving.
And what’s a festival without food and drinks? Attendees savored local brews (including a special Bloktoberfest brew from 7Hills) and food truck favorites, with proceeds from beer sales going to support the missions of Inspiration Stables, the Crocus Foundation, the Urban Bicycle Food Mission, the Dubuque Jaycees, and the OAS Foundation.
Bloktoberfest 2024 proved once again why it’s a can’t-miss event, combining fun, creativity, and a shared commitment to giving back. With over $61,500 raised across 8 local charities since its inception, this festival continues to make a lasting impact on the Dubuque community. This year's event drew over 3,000 people and raised a total of $8,071.06 for participating local non-profits
