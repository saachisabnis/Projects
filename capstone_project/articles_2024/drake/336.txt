Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for January 26th, 2024. After yesterday’s barrage of new releases, you might have thought today would be quiet. But no! Not only are there several more releases, but a giant sale also kicked off. We cover the new games and offer a very large slice of said sales for your perusal. With plenty to cover, it’s best we get to it. Let’s go!
This is a collection of two retro-style action platformers, both of which are relatively recent NES releases. They have a comedic bent to them, which isn’t exactly a novel thing but might be something you appreciate. Both games are fairly challenging, and the character swapping aspect of the second game is cool. I think at this price point you get a fair value here, provided you enjoy the genre.
Here’s the 2024 edition of Axis Football, and it looks like they’ve taken a lot of feedback into account. Blocking has been totally overhauled, you can now save and resume matches in progress, the defensive playbook has gotten a serious boost, zone coverage has been adjusted, the difficulty curve has gotten some TLC, and the UI has been improved. There are additions to the franchise mode, customization, and more. If you liked the first game, you’ll certainly appreciate the improvements here. If you didn’t, perhaps they will convince you to give the series another shot.
You’re the soothsayer of your people, and you have to look to the stars and read the bones to give them advice on their daily matters. Be careful, as if you read things poorly the outcomes can be devastating. With a striking visual style and unique gameplay, this is one game that fans of titles like Coffee Talk and VA-11 Hall-A will want to take a closer look at.
It’s interesting how many new NES games come out these days. I like when one of them tries something really different for the platform, and while the NES had a handful of point-and-clickers, it wasn’t a terribly common genre to stumble across. So yes, I’m interested in Dead Tomb. It looks like it did its homework in the genre, and I think the premise is ripe for some good puzzles. Only a fiver? Sure, I’ll take a punt on that. If I’m particularly impressed, I’ll swing back and let you all know via a review.
This is a collection of two of the earlier console CD-ROM RPGs, presented in their original forms with fresh translations. If you played these games before, you’ll certainly notice some differences in the script here, but despite what you may have heard, these were indeed translated by a human. What can I say? They’re decent. I wouldn’t spend my last fifty bucks to play them, but for their era they are perfectly competent. Note that there are two more games in this series that will be arriving down the road in yet another collection, because that’s how Edia likes to do things.
Another well-regarded Metroidvania-style action-RPG is making its way to the Switch, and it’s the Definitive Edition. What does that mean? Let me look that up! It… does not say! Oh well. Just be secure knowing that this is indeed the definitive version of the game, because that is what the title says. It’s one of those Souls-flavored Metroidvanias, a Soulstroidvania if you will. People love it on other platforms, and Switch owners rarely sleep on a good game in this genre, so here’s to a probable match made in heaven.
There are these objects, see? And you have to find them. That’s your job. Find them. Play some mini-games. Look at the nice art. Maybe solve a puzzle or two? Well, you all know how these work by now and regular readers will also know that I’ve kind of checked out on games of this genre. If they’re your thing, don’t let this Grumpy Gus stop you.
A slightly saucy visual novel about running a lingerie shop. It’s a yuri-themed story, and there are multiple romance routes to explore that will affect the ending. You know, the usual thing. There are eleven different endings to find, so you have a fair bit of playing ahead of you if you want to see it all. A Gamuzumi joint, as you might expect.

Gosh, there are a lot of sales going on right now. I grabbed a lot of them. Wrote for a few hours. It’s not even a fraction of what is on sale, though. Be sure to head into the eShop and check your wishlists to see if anything has dropped. My wallet can’t handle this right now, but I hope yours are healthier!

That’s all for today and this week, friends. We’ll be back next week with more reviews, more new releases, more sales, and whatever big news rolls in. I haven’t decided how to spend my weekend yet, but I think I’ll play more Arkham Asylum. I’m having a good time replaying it after so many years have passed. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and as always, thanks for reading!
