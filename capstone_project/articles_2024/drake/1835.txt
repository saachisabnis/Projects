Rick Ross just achieved quite the milestone thanks to his 2019 collaboration with Drake, despite the fact the pair aren’t exactly seeing eye to eye at the moment.
On Wednesday (October 16), Chart Data confirmed that the pair’s song “Money In The Grave” has surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify – marking Ross’ first time ever doing so.

The song was one of a two-pack titled Best In The World Pack that Drizzy dropped in celebration of the Toronto Raptors’ first NBA championship.
The pair have been infamously embroiled in a beef since earlier this year, and during his appearance on Yung Miami‘s Caresha Please podcast last month, Ross was asked about the history and status of his issues with The Boy.

“He mentioned my name, and that’s a no-no,” Ross said about the origin of the beef. “Don’t do that, especially when it ain’t about no real shit. But when you do that, okay then: this is how we gonna play.”
“I can wake up every day and say ‘BBL Drizzy’ or some old shit, while I’m smoking a joint, listening to the waterfalls and all that shit, looking at the birds fly off,” he continued. “That shit easy for me.”

Tension between Rick Ross and Drake exploded into the open in the midst of the Drake/Kendrick Lamar beef this past spring, when the Canadian superstar mentioned the “Hustlin’” rapper on the diss track “Push Ups.” Ross responded with a song of his own, “Champagne Moments.”
During their chat, Yung Miami brought up Ross’ long-ago mediation of the beef between Drake and Meek Mill, asking if it would also be possible for the Bawse to reconcile with Drake.

“I don’t know. It depend on how I feel,” Ross replied. “I ain’t losing no sleep over none of that shit.”
Weeks earlier, he also addressed the notion that there was a conspiracy at play because so many artists went against Drake at once and noted he was simply having fun.

“I thought all y’all was cool?” Shannon Sharpe asked at his Nightcap Summer Sessions: LIVE from Houston show with Ochocinco.
“I’ma be honest. On some rap shit – it was no conspiracies,” Ross said simply. “Rozay name was said [so] I’ma jump off the porch. That’s what I do. I’ma jump off the porch and I’ma have some fun and that’s what I did. I had some fun.”
