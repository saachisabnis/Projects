“Like I said Vulture Vol 2 OTW [fire emojis],” read the post.
Timbaland, who has collaborated with Kanye many times in the past and produced two tracks on Vultures 1, will also be contributing to the next installment.
According to Billboard, Vultures 1earned 148,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 129,000 of that figure coming from streaming units (167.78 million on-demand streams in total), 18,000 from pure album sales and 1,000 from TEA (track equivalent album) units.
Kanye is now level with Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand with 11 No. 1 albums to his name, with only Drake and Taylor Swift (13), JAY-Z (14) and The Beatles (19) ahead of him.

Vultures 1 debuts at No. 1 despite encountering a series of issues. The album was temporarily removed from streaming services five days after its release due to a complaint from its initial distributor, FUGA.
“On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement,” the company said. “Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”

The album was quickly reinstated on streaming platforms after Kanye and Ty Dolla found another distributor, Label Engine, who had previously released the singles “Vultures” and “Talking/Once Again.”
