FERGUS FALLS, Minn. (Valley News Live) - People in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, will soon decide whether to increase school funding to address facility needs in the district.
The proposal is for $54.8 million dollars over 22 years at an estimated bond rate of 5-percent. If approved, the new school would replace the McKinley and Adams facilities, both of which date back to 1939.
“Education has changed immensely since these two buildings were designed. They no longer meet the evolving educational requirements to foster an optimal teaching and learning environment,” the district states.
The proposal before the voters is for a 102,000 square-foot school for 3rd through 5th graders. The proposed location is 29 acres adjacent to Hilltop Lutheran Church and across Highway 210 from the Prairie Wetlands Learning Center.
“By passing the building bond, we are not just investing in bricks and mortar; we are investing in the future of our students, providing them with state-of-the-art facilities that will enhance their educational experiences and contribute to their overall success. It is a proactive step towards maintaining our commitment to excellence, and it reinforces our commitment to delivering quality education to our community, says Superintendent Jeff Drake.
According to the school district, the tax impact on a residential home valued at $250,000 would be $100 per year or $8 per month. Tax impact on a $500,000 commercial property is $453 per year.
