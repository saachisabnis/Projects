We have had so many winners this past week at Ellinwood School/Community Library!
The entries have been judged, and we are happy to announce the Best of Show for our AHF Art Show: Adult - Rhea Grandon; College - Monica Hammeke; High School - Bennett Jacobs; Middle School - Kaylynn Crawford; and Grade School - Kolton Fullbright. If you did not attend the AHF Bingo, winners may come to the library to pick up their Ellinwood Chamber of Commerce Gift Certificate. We thank everyone for bringing in your artwork. The display will be up the rest of this week and then the artists can pick up their art on July 29th.
We had another great turnout for AHF Bingo! Thank you to all who joined us! We also appreciate Wayne and Terri DeWerff for calling, Melody and Kelvin Johnston, Treva Paden, and Dana Drake for working, and all of the businesses and individuals who donated prizes! There were 230 prizes or bundles won by 186 attendees! Special thanks to H&B Communications for the two grand prizes: earbuds and an echo pop.
Summer Library Reading Top Readers will receive Ellinwood Chamber of Commerce Gift Certificates. Winners include: Adult - Joseph Kern; High School - Jonas Kern; Middle School - Madison Dombroski; and 4-6th grader - Maggie Kern. Our theme this summer was Adventure Begins at Your Library, so K-3 grade winner, Brock Krier, wins a fishing pole with lures. We hope he has continued adventures through the rest of his summer! Congratulations to our winners and keep reading. You may stop in to pick up your prizes at the library.
