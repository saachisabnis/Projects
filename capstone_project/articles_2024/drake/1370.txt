The 26-year-old Bronx native Cash Cobain has been behind the scenes flipping samples into rap beats for years, but when he finally hopped on the mic with Bay Swag for “Fisherrr” last winter, it instantly took over the city—and our feeds. After an Ice Spice feature, Drake and PinkPantheress collabs, and a summerlong viral streak, Cash gave us the real on industry plants, strip clubs, and his Slizettes.
