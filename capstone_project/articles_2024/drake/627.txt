About North Carolina:
Despite an up-and-down first two months of the season, North Carolina still enters the new year as one of the teams expected to challenge for the ACC’s regular season championship. 
Following a slow start, reigning ACC Player of the Year R.J. Davis comes into Wednesday night’s game playing his best basketball of the season. Davis broke out of a shooting slump by knocking down 5-of-10 threes in the team’s Sunday romp over Campbell. He’s averaging 18.8 ppg and 3.9 apg. This will be Chucky Hepburn’s tallest defensive test of the season so far. 
Super talented freshman Ian Jackson just earned national Freshman of the Week honors after scoring 24 points in the team’s win over UCLA and 26 against Campbell. Jackson is an explosive guard with tremendous athleticism, who is ultra-aggressive on both ends of the court. His quick-twitch speed and change of pace allow him to excel in transition and attack the rim relentlessly, which is perfect for UNC’s style of play. Him rounding into form just in time for this game is not ideal. 
In his third year as a Tar Heel, Seth Trimble has been asked to assume a larger role, and has done so seamlessly. He’s averaging 14.8 ppg, second-best on the team, and is the UNC player the Cards can least afford to leave open on the perimeter. Trimble, who is also Carolina’s best overall defensive player, missed the Campbell game on Sunday with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be able to play Wednesday night. 
Sophomore Elliot Cadeau looks a lot like the player we saw for most of last season. The feast or famine floor general is dishing out a terrific 6.2 assists per game, but turning the ball over at an alarming rate of 3.3 tpg. When he plays within himself, he’s remarkably effective. 
As always, Carolina is going to want to push pace and utilize the secondary break to generate a heavy chunk of their offense, which will be a challenge for the short-handed Cardinals. The Heels are playing at the 7th-fastest pace in the country and are the third most explosive transition scoring team in Division-I. Louisville must be engaged and focused after missed shots and live ball situations in order to avoid handing UNC a bunch of uncontested points the way they did early on against Kentucky. 
U of L must force UNC to try and beat them from the outside, which is the weakest part of their offensive attack. If Davis and company go nuts from the outside, you tip your cap. 
Offensively, Hepburn and Edwards and company should be able to get what they want ... but we’re gonna need to make shots. Gotta make shots. Have to see the ball go through the basket.
