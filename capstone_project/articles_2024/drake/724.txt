The Los Angeles economy is a dynamic one, and the types of enterprises that make it hum are varied and diverse. And the minority-owned business sector is no exception. This special report looks at five of the creative movers and shakers – including a pair of clothing designers, a ceramist and and an interior designer – who make our economy the envy of the world.
Breegan Jane LLC
Headquarters: Marina Del Rey
Founded: 2016
Business: Interior design 
and home decor
Founder: Breegan Jane
You might recognize Breegan Jane as the host of HGTV’s “Dream Home,” or from her number of other appearances on Food Network, Discovery+ and Max. 
Jane is an interior designer, and her line of home accessories have been distributed in retail locations across the U.S. and Canada, including in HomeGoods and HomeSense stores. She recently launched a lighting collection in partnership with Savoy House and has a collection of wallpapers and fabrics created with Clarke & Clarke.
She also collaborates with philanthropy partner World Vision on women’s rights, with initial efforts focused on women and children in Kenya.
Tell us how you got your business started.
I’ve always had a creative background, but I realized I had a talent for interior design when I was in estate management building properties for others. I had to bet on myself before I even had clients, and I did so by building equity in home ownership and flipping houses. Once I successfully flipped my first property, I found that more people wanted to hire me to help out with their projects and renovations. The rest is history.
Do you like being your own boss?
It really was my only choice, especially since I started my journey into single motherhood beforehand. I was not a “traditionally” hireable employee because I had two kids. I needed to figure out a way to provide for my children. I was (and still am) a true workaholic. However, at the time I didn’t have direct skills that translated into the workforce, and my responsibilities as a mother wouldn’t allow me to work a 9-to-5 job. I love the freedom working for myself provides. I know how difficult it was for me when I got started, so I work to extend assistance to employees when needed. I want to support people like me who are valuable workers but can support me in untraditional ways. The mutual loyalty and understanding have been amazing throughout the years.
Do you ever think of trading it in for a steady paycheck?
No, I don’t. I do, however, see the value in people (particularly women) pursuing more traditional trajectories like school and conventional occupations that teach them how to read and navigate contracts. Contractual agreements are a part of almost every part of our lives. Think about it; you enter into contracts when you go to buy a phone, a car, a house and definitely in relationships with clients and brands. Going to school to study law would absolutely put women in a place of power. For me, though, starting my company was the right fit. I am looking to transition my business into more licensing and passive income. I’m excited about using my talents in ways that allow me to partner with more traditional companies.
What’s the best aspect of running your own business? 
The best aspect of my job is having the freedom to balance my work and life as I see fit, and to manage my life as a mom and professional on my own terms. What’s more, I appreciate being in the position to give others who are in similar positions as I was when I started opportunities to thrive and develop their skills and talents.
And the worst?
The worst part of running your own business in this industry? It can be very lonely sometimes. It’s not always appropriate for CEOs to air grievances to employees. At the same time, we don’t have other external executives from whom we can receive advice, or even talk to. It’s difficult to navigate the pressure of success. Failure means you’ve failed yourself and your company. That’s a hard pill to swallow. Nobody cares about the success of the business like you care, and there’s oftentimes no blueprint or rulebook to govern how to solve problems. That can be challenging.
What advice would you give someone about to start their own business?
I’d definitely recommend that new business owners start small, and start one venture at a time. Create a system or workflow you can manage. Once you’ve mastered that, grow slowly and efficiently. If it’s a clothing line you want to start, try selling T -shirts before quitting your day job – then go all in. Be wise and have a plan.
What’s the biggest challenge your business has faced? And how did you deal with it?
The biggest challenge my company faced was being sued for a situation in which I was not at fault. It was difficult because, even though I wasn’t wrong, it was easier to settle and move on from the situation when I counted the cost of pursuing my innocence in court. Moving on was the best way to not let the situation consume my life, but it was a hard thing to go through.
Has being Black affected your business, either in a good way or bad?
I’d say it has in both ways. When you are authentically yourself, you can sometimes ruffle feathers. But, you also find power in that authenticity. I am given some opportunities because companies often want to highlight African American stories. But why is that? I think it’s because our challenges as Black humans are often riddled with stereotypes and unfair discrimination. While people may have a choice in reading or focusing on that experience, being black was never a choice I had. It’s just who I am, and I am extremely proud of that person — who happens to be Black.
Do you think you’ll ever start another business?
What people don’t know about me is that I do have other businesses. I’ve authored books, for example, and I have dreams of starting a line of kaftans. There are so many different aspects of growing my company as an all-encompassing lifestyle brand on the horizon. Being a serial entrepreneur started with a clothing store and a fashion line and evolved into an interior design business. I’m not sure what the next opportunity will be, but I know I will always be starting new businesses.
Cross Colours
Headquarters: Beverly Hills
Founded: 1989
Business: Fashion
Founders: Carl Jones and TJ Walker
Cross Colours was founded in 1989 and is still making a major impact on the fashion industry today. Founders Carl Jones and TJ Walker initially gained fame when Will Smith wore their designs on the television hit “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” Following that exposure, their company took off, and shortly after garnered upward of $100 million in annual sales.  
The clothing line has seen a recent resurgence, after an uptick in interest in 1990s fashion culture among young consumers. The brand’s creations are still sought after by celebrities such as Snoop Dogg, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa and Drake. Jones and Walker answered our questions about their company and its future.
Tell us how you got your business started.
When we got started in the late ’80s, TJ and I saw a void in the apparel market for Black consumers. We wanted to create something for the culture, something for our community. We recognized that the look, style and fit that Black consumers were looking for at the time did not exist. There was no specific fit for African Americans, so we created it. We changed the specs of our men’s sizes, essentially sizing everything up, and we used bright colors and bold messages for storytelling. In the end, we created something that we’re extremely proud of.
Do you like being your own boss?
Absolutely! We love waking up in the morning and making decisions about our business. We’re passionate about the business of fashion and the production process. We also recognize that it’s rare to wake up every day excited about work; each day is packed with creativity, operational decisions and even challenges, and that is what fuels us and keeps us going.
Do you ever think of trading it in for a steady paycheck?
We wouldn’t trade our business for anything. Our mission is to continue representing the Black consumer in a truly authentic way, and we wouldn’t give it up for anything.
What’s the best aspect of running your own business? 
The best part of running our own business is the ability to use creativity to positively impact the culture. It’s the feeling of establishing a story we feel resonates with our community, building the collection and then presenting it to the world.
And the worst?
We don’t see any horrible aspects to running our own business because we recognize that our mission is important. As long as you’re making the right decisions with your customer in mind, there are no downsides.
What advice would you give someone who’s about to start their own business?
Find something that you absolutely love. When starting your own business, this is the most important element. When things get difficult, which will happen at times because in fashion obstacles are inevitable, your genuine passion for the work you do will allow you to find ways to work through those challenges.
What’s the biggest challenge your business has faced? And how did you deal with it?
We established our business with the goal of making high-quality product that we could sell at reasonable prices. We’ve had to confront the difficult reality that prices naturally rise over time, which impacts prices for our customers. However, we continue to keep our customer top of mind and create premium apparel that they know will last.
Has being Black affected your business, either in a good way or bad?
Being Black has always been a key component of our business. Our life experiences as Black men in America have informed our decisions from a creative standpoint. Moreover, being Black has shaped the way we choose to show up for our customers, the issues we speak up for, and our community engagement.
Our advice for minority business owners has always been to never allow your race, gender or skin tone to limit your innate ability to positively impact society. Customers and suppliers will show up for you, do business with you, buy from you if you have something that is truly original.
Do you think you’ll ever start another business?
The plan as of right now is to expand Cross Colours into new retail avenues via licensing and distribution in foreign markets. Doing so will allow us to tell more stories, experiment with more styles, and inspire more people.
Ekua Ceramics
Headquarters: Long Beach
Business: Ceramics
Founder: Sara Ekua Todd
Sara Ekua Todd, founder of Ekua Ceramics, claims that her artistic taste sprung from her multi-ethnic upbringing. Raised in Belgium, she moved to Los Angeles in 2012 and now creates ceramic pieces that have been featured in New York Magazine, Ebony Magazine and Architectural Digest. Todd said living and studying in Antwerp and growing up in an artistic household gave her a very keen sense of style that translates into all the objects she creates. 
Tell us how you got your business started?
I decided to launch Ekua Ceramics after working with clay for a few years. I thought that my style was unique enough to be seen by the masses. I’m glad I took the leap and started doing wholesale, it’s what really pushed me to work on this fulltime.
Do you like being your own boss?
Yes! I work well with other people, but I love the luxury of making my own rules.
Do you ever think of trading it in for a steady paycheck?
Absolutely; 2023 especially was extremely hard. This year is already looking better than last year so I’m excited to be working on projects and being busy.
What advice would you give someone who’s about to start their own business?
Have a plan, make sure you have enough funds to survive for a few months, because you never know when it might get hard.
What’s the biggest challenge your business has faced? And how did you deal with it?
Probably 2023; I simply kept working and hoping things would get better. Slow sales and barely any wholesale orders made it really difficult. I just kept going even when I felt like giving up – it’s OK to feel down every now and then.
Has being a minority affected your business, either in a good way or bad?
I have been very fortunate the past few years and have gotten some amazing press and opportunities.
Do you think you’ll ever start another business?
Yes, I could see myself starting another business, I have a ton of ideas all the time!
Inter-Con Security
Headquarters: Pasadena
Founded: 1973
Business: Security services
Founders: Enrique Hernandez and Bertha Hernandez
President and CEO: Henry Hernandez
Number of Employees: 35,000
Inter-Con Security, based in Pasadena, provides customized security services to Fortune 500 companies, public utilities, ultra-high net-worth individuals, nonprofit organizations and governments around the world.  The company is currently focused on growing its North American operations and has more than doubled in size since 2020. It is among the largest and fastest-growing security companies in the world, with more than 35,000 employees globally. It remains 100% family owned and managed under president and chief executive, Henry Hernandez.
In March 2023, Inter-Con was awarded a contract by Southern California Edison to provide 1,000 security professionals with infrastructure to secure the power company’s 50,000-square-mile service territory. We spoke with Hernandez about his company and plans.
Tell us how you got your business started.
Inter-Con was founded 50 years ago when my grandparents, Hank and Bertha Hernandez, used their life savings to start a security company here in Los Angeles.  My grandfather had dropped out of high school to join the Army and then served 20 years in the LAPD.  He used his pension and experience as a police officer to get Inter-Con off the ground. My father was the first in our family to graduate high school, and went on to Harvard College and Harvard Law School before joining the business. He grew Inter-Con into an international company with operations across North and South America and Africa. I followed my father to Harvard for college and law school, worked as an attorney in private practice for a few years, and then joined Inter-Con in 2016.  
Do you like being your own boss?
Yes, but like any role, leadership has benefits and drawbacks. The CEO is part of a much larger team – and only as good as the members of the team. In addition, any good CEO serves multiple constituents, including clients, employees and shareholders. Juggling these priorities can be complicated when the shareholders are also your family members.
Do you ever think of trading it in for a steady paycheck?
Prior to my current role, I worked as an attorney in private practice at a large firm in New York City. While I enjoyed the training I received and the discipline I learned working long hours as a legal associate, it would be difficult to imagine returning to that lifestyle. Betting on myself and my team has been one of the most rewarding things that I’ve done in my professional career.
What’s the best aspect of running your own business? 
In my experience, the best part of leadership is having the opportunity to build something from scratch: assembling a team, developing and communicating a vision, and then working together to make that vision a reality. I am constantly amazed by the hard work and dedication of the team around me, and incredibly thankful that I have the opportunity to work with such talented people.  
And the worst?
By contrast, the worst part, by far, is the stress! Thirty-five thousand individuals worldwide rely on Inter-Con to provide for themselves and their families, and the company is ingrained with our family legacy. The current leadership team has been given the incredible opportunity to carry this legacy forward, but this is also an incredible responsibility that can be a heavy burden. 
 What advice would you give someone who’s about to start their own business?
Clearly articulate your vision for the company, assemble the right team, incentivize them to succeed, and then do everything you can to support them.
What’s the biggest challenge your business has faced? And how did you deal with it?
The biggest challenge for me has been managing growth. Growth is challenging for many reasons, including successfully scaling your systems and processes to keep up with demand. Complicating things, the credit markets have been difficult and unpredictable in recent years, creating headwinds to fund expansion. We successfully dealt with these issues by investing heavily in our backend to stay ahead of demand, and from a financing perspective we were incredibly fortunate to have partnered with great lenders who believed in us and our ability to grow profitably. 
Has being minority-owned affected your business, either in a good way or bad?
As a 100% Hispanic-owned company that is run by the children of immigrants, I think we bring a clear work ethic and value set to everything we do. However, our company’s theory has always been that if we put the best product out there, the market will recognize this,and we will have success.
Do you think you’ll ever start another business?
I don’t know that I’ll ever leave Inter-Con, but if for whatever reason I wasn’t in my current role, my first priority would be to take some much-needed rest. Of course, after a few months I’m sure that I would be back at it, working to start something new.
Neon Cowboy
Headquarters: Beverly Grove
Founded: 2014
Founder: Asia Hall
Asia Hall founded her Beverly Grove-based company, Neon Cowboy, in 2014 and since then has sold more than 35,000 cowboy hats. Hall, now the company’s chief executive, majored in computer science and art with the aim of fusing fashion with technology. 
In addition to hats, the company’s product range has extended to a number of light-up accessories, including LED wireless nails, LED face jewelry and galaxy-inspired roller skate projectors. Her first celebrity customer was Miley Cyrus. The company’s products have since been worn by the likes of Beyoncé, Missy Elliott, Kesha and Dua Lipa. She was featured at Los Angeles Fashion Week during the fall 2023 show, and her company is now branching into providing unique looks for bachelorette parties, weddings and experiential events. 
Tell us how you got your business started.
In college I attended the music festival Stagecoach, which is the third weekend of Coachella. It’s a country music festival. I noticed that at night there was an opportunity to have the audience glow and light up while the headliners were performing. I figured if you were to look at a neon bar sign with a cowboy hat on it, then you should be able to wear that hat. I set out to design the first Neon Cowboy hat, and the next year made 11 units for my friends and I to wear to the music festival. 
Do you like being your own boss?
Yes, creatively it is helpful to be able to R&D the products and accessories I believe will resonate with our customers. 
Do you ever think of trading it in for a steady paycheck?
Not usually; I think the freedom to create is something that I’ve worked very hard for.
What’s the best aspect of running your own business? And the worst?
I love the R&D process and working with our manufacturers to mass produce light-up accessories that haven’t been on the market yet.
What advice would you give someone who’s about to start their own business?
Prioritize cash flow and always test your idea with the market before you invest in starting a business.
 What’s the biggest challenge your business has faced? And how did you deal with it?
Knockoffs have been a large issue for us because our products are all new to the market. We prioritized patents early and hired an IP lawyer to help protect us from future issues.
Has being a minority affected your business, either in a good way or bad?
I’m half Black and Chinese. It has been great to be able to look at problem-solving and creativity from a different light and really bring new ideas to the market.
Do you think you’ll ever start another business?
Yes, I think there are a lot of opportunities to branch out and explore more product design in other industries.
