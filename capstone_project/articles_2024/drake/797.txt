In a recent interview with Today, Nickelodeon alum Drake Bell elaborated on his decision to participate in the ID docuseries Quiet On Set, where he publicly shared his experience of being sexually abused by dialogue coach Brian Peck.
When asked why he chose to reveal his story after so many years, Bell explained, “Things were spiraling out of control emotionally and mentally, and I thought maybe this could help in the healing process and also help others who have gone through the same situations or similar situations.”
In the documentary, Bell disclosed that he was the anonymous young actor who accused Peck of sexual abuse, an ordeal that began when Bell was just 15 years old. Peck was convicted in 2004 and served a 16-month prison sentence for his crimes.
Bell’s courageous decision to share his story aims to bring awareness to the issue and offer support to others who may have faced similar experiences.
