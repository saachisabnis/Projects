As Camila Cabello gets ready for the release of her hotly-anticipated new album C,XOXO, on Friday, the former Fifth Harmony member shared a story about songwriting advice that Taylor Swift gave to her when Cabello was a teenager. In an interview with Taylen Biggs, Cabello recounted when she attended the VMA’s when she was still with Fifth Harmony, and Swift shared some helpful suggestions that influences her songwriting to this day. “I was maybe about 16 when I met one of my songwriting heroes, Taylor Swift,” Cabello says. “I was having a hard time getting out of this creative rut.” So the X-Factor alum asked Swift, ‘What would you say if you’re having a lot of self doubt and you feel a little stuck?’ Cabello still recalls Swift’s supportive response. “She said, ‘When that happens to me, I just keep writing through it. You just gotta keep going, keep writing through it.’” (Billboard)
