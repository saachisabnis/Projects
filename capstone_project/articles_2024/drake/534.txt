Drake continues to build up a lyrical legacy of war with "The Heart Part 6," his latest verbal attack on Kendrick Lamar.
Following the past two days of diss tracks from both sides—"6:16 in LA," "Family Matters," "Meet the Grahams" and "Not Like Us"—Drake came through with "The Heart Part 6" on Sunday (May 5). The next song in this vicious volley with K-Dot finds Drake cutting deep with the insults over a Boi-1da and Coleman-produced beat.
This time, he doubles down on the claim that Kendrick's fiancée, Whitney Alford, cheated on him with Dave Free, Kenny's pgLang partner and friend. Drake insists Free is actually the father of K-Dot's son. Drizzy also insists the West Coast MC needs to "fact-check things" because he was fed false information, namely the stolen goods pictured on the cover art for Kendrick's "Meet the Grahams" artwork. The 6 God even addresses K-Dot’s ongoing accusations that Drake likes underage girls.
See the new biting words Drake shoots at Kendrick Lamar in the lyrics below.
