Drake once again demonstrated his generosity during his “It’s All A Blur — Big As The What?” tour. At a recent show in Kansas City, he offered to pay off a fan’s mortgage after reading a touching letter that was thrown onstage. “You said, ‘[Pay] off my mom’s house, rest in peace,’” he read. “Your mom passed away? Alright. And you owe … Oh, this is the outstanding balance right here. This is a lot of money right here.”
Drake was moved by the fan’s plea and assured them he would take care of the $160,000. This certainly isn’t the first time he has made such a kind gesture, it’s actually become a staple of his concerts. He recently gifted $100,000 to a Nashville concertgoer who had completed chemotherapy.
