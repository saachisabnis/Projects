It is with great sadness that I write to inform the people of Taunton, on behalf of the ToneFM membership, about the closure of ToneFM, our beloved local radio station. Established in 2013, ToneFM has been at the heart of our community for over a decade, providing news, entertainment, and a vital platform for local voices.
I have been a member and presenter myself, presenting the Meditation show, but I have now moved to Apple FM as a presenter. Although no longer directly involved with ToneFM, I have many friends still there, battling with the situation they now find themselves in. They are aware that I am writing this letter.
Regrettably, the station has been struggling for the past almost two years under the sole management of one director, Patch Jobson. Under his control, the station gradually declined and is now insolvent, and will most likely move towards liquidation due to the debt position. Despite repeated concerns raised, Patch chose to operate the station in an unprofessional manner, concealing the financial realities from the membership and falsely presenting a positive outlook. The extent of the financial mismanagement has only now become clear following Patch’s recent resignation as director.
The members of ToneFM, all of whom are volunteers, are deeply shocked by this revelation. They have poured their time, energy, and passion into this station, and it is devastating to see it collapse under these circumstances. We know the wider Taunton community will share in the grief and disappointment at losing such a vital institution in this way.
In response, the members have contacted Companies House to appeal against Patch Jobson’s resignation. He has abandoned a situation that is entirely of his own making and must be held fully accountable—both legally and financially—for his actions.
The membership wish to take this opportunity to thank all their listeners and supporters over the years. ToneFM has been more than just a radio station; it was a community, and the members are heartbroken that it has come to this.
Yours sincerely, Andy Spragg, On behalf of the ToneFM Membership
