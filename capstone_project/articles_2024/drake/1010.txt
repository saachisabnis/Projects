FOXBORO, Mass. — Drake Maye and his Patriots teammates showed off some icy fits as they entered Gillette Stadium on Sunday.
The rookie quarterback and other Patriots players walked into their Week 13 contest against the Indianapolis Colts rocking Boston Bruins jerseys ahead of the Black and Gold’s centennial celebration.
Maye repped none other than star forward David Pastrnak, while Patriots captain David Andrews saluted Bruins captain Brad Marchand.
You can check out the full video here, courtesy of the Patriots. The Black and Gold clearly appreciated it, as well.
It’s a jam-packed day in Boston sports with the Patriots kicking off at 1 p.m. ET and the Bruins set to drop the puck at 3 p.m. ET, following the centennial celebration. You can watch the celebration on NESN starting at 1 p.m. ET.
