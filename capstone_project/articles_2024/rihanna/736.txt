A$AP Rocky’s partnership with Puma has been largely quiet on the footwear front thus far, but that’s finally set to change near the end of the September. 
In addition to the previous colorway reported, the A$AP Rocky x Puma Inhale sneaker has just been confirmed with two more distressed colorways on the way. A black, red and cream edition serves as the inverse to the cream and red Inhale seen before, and a third colorway is the most complex of the lot in cream, black, yellow and below.
All three of the sneakers have oil-like smudges and scuffing, as well as a brand new “Flacko” logo on the tongue and speed-lacing toggles. The two colorways with red elements have been confirmed by Puma for a late-September release, and a leak has revealed the third version with a translucent, yellow-to-blue gradient outsole will release at another date before the end of 2024.

Following the announcement of Rihanna’s return to Puma in spring 2023, A$AP Rocky was named creative director for the brand’s Formula 1 line later in the year. So far, the only sneaker to feature Rocky’s name was another Inhale — but only in the form of 100 randomly selected pairs of the OG colorway with a special-edition insole. 
This new wave of Rocky’s Inhale sneakers marks a more significant push forward for the Puma partnership, coming after they were first shown at his Paris Fashion Week show during the summer. Each will comes in a box fashioned like a tool cabinet to continue the automotive theme. 
The A$AP Rocky x Puma Inhale in “Black/Pop Red” and “Alpine Snow/Silver Sand Dune” will release September 26 through Puma’s website and select third-party retailers, with the “Cream/Black” colorway to follow later in the year. Pricing is set at $130.
