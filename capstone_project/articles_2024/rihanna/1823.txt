We truly never know what to expect from Rihanna. You want a new album? Too bad, you’re getting Fenty Beauty. Super Bowl Halftime Show? Pregnancy reveal. In short, when the world zigs, RiRi zags. Last night proved no exception: Rihanna took a stroll through New York with A$AP Rocky, where she rocked a two-piece zebra-print set.
In case you missed it, a leopard print revival has been brewing for some time now, with everyone from Kendall Jenner and Irina Shayk to Maya Hawke and Dua Lipa taking the trend for a spin. (And don’t forget about the Wales Bonner Sambas that have everybody and their mother in a chokehold.) But Rihanna is going to do her own thing no matter what, and if that means wearing zebra stripes in place of leopard spots, then so be it!
RiRi paired the gauzy button-up and pants set with playful accessories. She threw a black patent leather bag over her shoulder and wore a pair of silver metallic ballet flats – perfect for a jaunt around the streets of SoHo – which she contrasted with a New York Yankees cap. Maybe, to Rihanna, zebra is to leopard print what the Yankees are to the Mets?
