Judges have decided not to retry after evidence of juror misconduct overturned the original verdict
Vybz Kartel has been freed from prison after 10 years following a landmark decision by the Jamaica Court of Appeal. 
Alongside Shawn ‘Shawn Storm’ Campbell, Kahira Jones, and Andre St John, the dancehall star was convicted in 2014 of the 2011 murder of Clive 'Lizard' Williams. In March, the UK's Privy Council overturned the verdict due to evidence of juror misconduct. 
It was then left to Justices Marva McDonald-Bishop, Paulette Williams, and David Fraser to make a final judgement on whether to retry the co-defendants. On Wednesday, they unanimously decided not to pursue the case further in "the interests of justice."
Among other factors, Kartel's declining health was taken into consideration, along with the availability of witnesses and the likelihood of bias against the defendants. 
During the original trial, one member of the jury was accused of offering money to others in an attempt to sway the verdict. Despite being made aware of this, the presiding judge chose to continue with the hearing. This became the focal point of a lengthy appeals process, which began when Kartel was first sentenced. At that time he was one of Jamaica's biggest artists, recording with the likes of Rihanna, Busta Rhythms and Missy Elliot. While in prison, he continued to record and release music.
