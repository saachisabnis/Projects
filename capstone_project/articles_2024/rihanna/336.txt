If you've ever been chastised for your peculiar or downright strange habits, it could be that you're simply a misunderstood genius. History has shown us that high IQs don't always align with what's considered 'normal'. Take Ludwig van Beethoven, the renowned composer, as an example. His morning routine involved counting sixty coffee beans and dunking his head in cold water - a regimen that wouldn't seem too out of place in some TikTok wellness communities today.
Lord Byron, the 19th-century writer, was known for his eccentricities, including keeping a bear as a pet during his university years and even attempting to register it for classes. While most of us wouldn't go to such extremes, if you consider yourself quite clever, you might see some of your own behaviours reflected in the following list....reports the Mirror.
1. Talking to yourself.
Often seen as a sign of insanity, research suggests that having a chat with oneself can actually enhance everything from memory to focus.
According to a report by Mail Online, a 2017 study found that our brains behave similarly to those of monkeys when we stop talking to ourselves, whether silently or aloud. In this experiment, participants were asked to repeat nonsensical sounds out loud - like 'blah-blah-blah' - while performing visual and auditory tasks.
In a fascinating piece for The Conversation, Bangor University's neuropsychology lecturer Paloma Mar-Beffa observed: "Because we cannot say two things at the same time, muttering these sounds made participants unable to tell themselves what to do in each task. Under these circumstances, humans behaved like monkeys do, activating separate visual and sound areas of the brain for each task. This study elegantly showed that talking to ourselves is probably not the only way to control our behaviour, but it is the one that we prefer and use by default."

2. Night owl tendencies.
The importance of a good night's sleep can't be overstated when it comes to maintaining both physical and mental health. Yet, if you find yourself wide awake with thoughts buzzing around your head while others are deep in slumber, it could be a sign of high intelligence.
A study from Imperial College London, published in January and involving 26,000 adults, suggests that those who are more active at night, often referred to as 'night owls', generally score higher on cognitive tests.
Dr Raha West of UCL's Department of Surgery and Cancer, the lead author of the study, remarked: "Our study found that adults who are naturally more active in the evening (what we called 'eveningness') tended to perform better on cognitive tests than those who are 'morning people'. Rather than just being personal preferences, these chronotypes could impact our cognitive function."
Dr West emphasised: "While understanding and working with your natural sleep tendencies is essential, it's equally important to remember to get just enough sleep, not too long or too short. This is crucial for keeping your brain healthy and functioning at its best." Notable personalities who have thrived during the night include Irish literary giant James Joyce, the indomitable wartime leader Winston Churchill, and the iconic musician Bob Dylan.
3. Daydreaming.
When it comes to daydreaming, many of us can relate to being lost in our thoughts at times. The oft-repeated advice to 'wake up' or 'snap out of it' might not be sound after all, since zoning out is actually a useful mental exercise.
Studies, like one in 2017 conducted by Dr Eric Schumacher and Christine Godwin from Georgia Institute of Technology, revealed that those who often daydream have better cognitive abilities and higher levels of creativity and intelligence. Providing encouragement to avid daydreamers everywhere, Dr. Schumacher said: "People with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering."
As reported by MedicalNewsToday, he also noted: "Our findings remind me of the absent-minded professor - someone who's brilliant, but off in his or her own world, sometimes oblivious to their own surroundings. Or, schoolchildren who are too intellectually advanced for their classes. While it may take five minutes for their friends to learn something new, they figure it out in a minute, then check out and start daydreaming."
Famous individuals who are known for their propensity to daydream include the likes of Rihanna, Emma Stone, and the Bronte sisters, whose childhood escapades ultimately fuelled the creation of their iconic literary works.
4. Messy office space.
The concept of working amidst a desk strewn with mess, which for some is unthinkable, could actually indicate a genius mind that doesn't conform to conventional norms.
Consider, for example, a 2013 research published in Psychological Science where participants were positioned in either an orderly or disorderly office environment and tasked with ideating novel uses for ping pong balls. Both groups generated a comparable number of suggestions, yet those from the untidy setting displayed more inventiveness.
Psychological scientist Kathleen Vohs, from the University of Minnesota, revealed: "Being in a messy room led to something that firms, industries, and societies want more of: Creativity." She elaborated: "Disorderly environments seem to inspire breaking free of tradition, which can produce fresh insights. Orderly environments, in contrast, encourage convention and playing it safe."

5. Inquisitiveness.
Some individuals may consider themselves too knowledgeable to ask questions, assuming they already have all the answers. However, those with genuine intelligence are likely to be constantly asking questions, driven by a natural curiosity about their surroundings and a thirst for knowledge.
Despite the fear of appearing uninformed by asking questions, this is not the case. In fact, research indicates that those who ask questions are often seen as more competent. A 2015 study from Harvard Business School stated: "Although individuals can derive substantial benefits from exchanging information and ideas, many individuals are reluctant to seek advice from others. We find that people are reticent to seek advice for fear of appearing incompetent."
"This fear, however, is misplaced. We demonstrate that individuals perceive those who seek advice as more competent than those who do not seek advice. This effect is moderated by task difficulty, advisor egocentrism, and advisor expertise. Individuals perceive those who seek advice as more competent when the task is difficult than when it is easy when people seek advice from them personally than when they seek advice from others, and when people seek advice from experts than from non-experts or not at all."
6. Introvert tendencies.
As many introverts can attest, extroverts often try to pull you out of your comfort zone, even when you're perfectly content with a quiet night in and a hot chocolate. Now, you have the perfect reason to avoid that loud nightclub.
Introverted tendencies, as suspected by many quiet types, are linked to deep levels of critical thinking. A Harvard study interestingly discovered that introverts' brains contain thicker grey matter compared to extroverts, and also showed more activity in the frontal lobes - the area responsible for analytical and rational thought.
In her bestselling book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, author and introvert Susan Cain emphasised the significance of introverts, stating: "Extroverts are more likely to focus on what's happening around them. It's as if extroverts are seeing 'what is', while their introverted peers are asking 'what if? '."
7. Maintaining a full bookshelf.
If you're looking to enhance your intelligence, always having a book at hand is a good start. The positive effects are substantial and will probably be beneficial in all aspects of your life. Plus, it's a much more calming hobby than endlessly scrolling through your phone.
Groundbreaking research from Boston Children's Hospital has revealed that diving into a good book can actually foster the formation of new neural pathways and fortify the white matter within the corpus callosum, which is the thick band of nerve fibres connecting the brain's left and right hemispheres. This neural remodeling enhances the communication between the two sides of the brain, potentially leading to quicker and more efficient processing of information.
Reading is a habit that one is never too young or old to adopt. Echoing this sentiment is the theoretical physicist Albert Einstein - arguably the most renowned genius in history - who advised: "If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales."
