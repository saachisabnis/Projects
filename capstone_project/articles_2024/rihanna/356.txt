After Pharrell Williams was named the head menswear designer of Louis Vuitton, the music mogul has kept the company relevant with young fans by bringing in Rihanna, Clipse, Jay-Z, and Tyler, The Creator to help promote the brand. Now, Pharrell has just named Pusha T as the newest brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton. The fashion house released a statement about their creative partnership with Pusha, which complimented both the rapper’s creativity and his personal style. 
“His ambassadorial nomination at Louis Vuitton is a testament to his commitment to artistry and a strong personal style, both echoing the maison’s own dedication to unique expression across fashion and culture.” Pusha is continuing his collaboration with Pharrel outside of the fashion world, with Clipse reuniting and recording a new album that will be produced by Williams, and the rap duo are also set to appear in Williams’ upcoming biopic, Piece By Piece.
