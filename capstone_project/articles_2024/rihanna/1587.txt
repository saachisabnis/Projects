Over the years, several celebrities have confessed to being into feet, with Ricky Martin being the latest among them.
In a recent interview with GQ, the 52-year-old Puerto Rican music icon said, "I love feet. I have a foot thing."
Martin candidly shared details about his love for feet, telling the magazine, "I love foot massages, and I would kiss your feet like crazy for hours."
Ludacris also previously talked about having a foot fetish during a 2004 interview with "Today."
"I definitely love girls with beautiful feet. I have a foot fetish," he confessed. "Messed up feet man, sometimes she can trick me and just wear boots and not even show her feet. But when I see the feet, it's a wrap."
According to Page Six, Enrique Iglesias, Tommy Lee, and Jack Black were also among the stars who have publicly opened up about being into feet.
"My mother was Miss Greece in 1957. She's gorgeous and she's got beautiful toes. That's one of the reasons I have a foot fetish today," the outlet quoted Lee as saying. "When I was a kid I'd massage her feet."
