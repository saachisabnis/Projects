From the Met Gala red carpet to front row at New York Fashion Week, billionaire businesswoman and R&B singer Rihanna is known for showing up in high-fashion looks that make heads turn. But sometimes, even an international superstar and fashion icon has to pop out in something casual every now and then, right?
 The “Umbrella” artist was recently spotted out on a Beverly Hills shopping trip with partner A$AP Rocky, and some of the biggest fashion mags can’t stop talking about her laid back look.
Let’s not get it twisted. This is Rihanna we’re talking about, and her casual is anything but average. In fact, everything she was wearing was designer from head to toe. RiRi’s look included a pair of Alexander Wang shorts, a Martine Rose track jacket and a long fur coat.
However, it was her shoes that stole the show – a pair of Crocs (that’s right, the lightweight, colorful slip on shoes that are full of holes). But of course, we’re not just talking about any old Crocs here. Rihanna was wearing a pair from Irish fashion designer Simone Rocha’s limited edition collaboration with the popular footwear brand. 
The Simone Rocha x Crocs collection includes bejeweled versions of some of the classic shoe designs decorated with pearls and silver studs that Rocha says are meant to explore “the creative juxtaposition of femininity and utilitarianism.” The collection dropped back in October, and much to fans’ disappointment, the shoes sold out almost immediately. Rihanna managed to get her hands on a pair of the Classic Clogs, which were originally priced at $175.
Even if Crocs aren’t your thing, you have to give ya girl her props for making them werk in one of the most exclusive places to shop. The folks at British Vogue said it best on X:
“Leave It To Rihanna To Make Crocs High-Fashion.”
