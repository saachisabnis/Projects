With Election Day here, Rihanna is urging her followers to go to the polls—especially because she can't.
On Monday (Nov. 4), the “Work” hitmaker shared a playful video on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) of herself sitting in a car, looking longingly out the window as she jokes, "POV: me trying to sneak into the polls with my son's passport #VoteCauseICant."
In the caption, she wrote, "When protecting p**sies and firing p**sies can happen all in one vote. #votecauseicant #TanSuitSeason,” highlighting the significance of protecting women's rights during this presidential election.
Although her sons, RZA, 2, and Riot Rose, 14 months, were both born in the U.S., Rihanna was born in Barbados and moved to the country in 2005 without changing her citizenship.
In a recent interview, the mom opened up about life as a parent and her hopes of expanding her family. She spoke about raising two young boys and said, "The best, I live for it. It’s never a dull moment. I love when they climb off the chandeliers. I love when they literally are so scary that I’m forced to have fun. Me running around, me lifting them up, it’s all fun, it’s all exercise. But it works out for both of us, all of our kids." When the host suggested adding a daughter to her family, Rihanna eagerly responded, "I wanna have a girl. I wouldn’t know what to do ’cause I only know about boys so far. It will be a new adventure."
