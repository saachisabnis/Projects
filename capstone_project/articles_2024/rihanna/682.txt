Victoria's Secret is staging a big comeback next week by putting on the first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in six years. Looking to stand out again from competitors like Rihanna's inclusive Savage x Fenty, Angles will be decked out in lingerie and actual clothing. (We're not 100 percent sure about the wings, though.) Turns out, Victoria's Secret enlisted Joseph Altuzarra as its first atelier designer in residence.
What does that mean exactly? Well, according to the lingerie brand, it involves designing several ready-to-wear collections so customers can get their underwear and outerwear all in the same place. We'll actually get a preview of the new collaboration during next week's show. The remainder will be sprinkled throughout 2025.
Tune in to watch the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Tuesday, October 15 at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time via Instagram, YouTube and TikTok as well as on the Amazon Live channel.
