If you’re looking to make a statement with your makeup, you literally cannot go wrong with black lipstick. Whether you’re a proud goth icon or someone who needs one for Halloween, we got you. Black lipsticks are so beautiful, and it’s the perfect way to step up your fall look.
Now, not only do we love black lipstick, but so does Rihanna. In fact, she said via Image, “I love black lipstick. I think it’s daring, it’s bold. There’s a way that it can be really, really beautiful. It’s one of those colors that people shy away from a lot, but if you do the right balance of makeup, I think black is such a beautiful color. It could be the new red.”
So, if you’re daring enough, you should see the top choices we found that shoppers can’t get enough of. From drugstore staples from NYX and Black Radiance to luxe options from Gucci, there’s a black lipstick in here for everyone.
And since Halloween is only two days away, a lot of these can be shipped to you before the big night, and if you’re celebrating Halloweekend this weekend.

If you’re more of a lipstick girly than a liquid lipstick person, then you can’t go wrong with the Black Radiance Perfect Tone Lipstick in Black Out. This dark lipstick has a cream, satin finish, making your pout look and feel moisturized all day long.
One shopper said, “inexpensive and worked great as costume lipstick and for coloring around the eyes and mouth as part of a zombie costume look. Easy to apply, lasted well, and was not hard to remove.”
The Lime Crime Velvetines Liquid Matte Lipstick in Black Velvet is a kiss-proof, transfer-proof matte liquid lipstick that was designed for all-day wear. It’s a neutral black lipstick that’ll look amazing on any skintone, and as an added bonus, it has a French vanilla scent. 
One shopper said, “I use this for my alt style of makeup and it’s perfect for long events! I can eat and drink in this lipstick and while it does wear down after a while, nothing but a thin coat will make it look like new.”
The go-to drugstore liquid lipstick for a moody, vampy look is easily the NYX Lip Lingerie XXL Matte Liquid Lipstick in Naughty Noir. Not only does this have a matte, smooth finish, but this matte lippie can hold for up to 16 hours without moving or cracking. Plus, it has over 9,000 five-star reviews, so you know it’s good.
In fact, one shopper said, “This liquid lipstick is so pigmented and creamy I could almost cry! And it’s NOT one of those shades of black that are actually dark blue or dark grey with shimmer, it is a full on black. It doesn’t transfer easy at all, provided that you are careful with eating and drinking with a straw. Not even kisses could sway this lipstick! It lasts me all day with only need for application after about 8 hours.”
That’s right, the iconic Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick has a deliciously dark, matte black lipstick in the shade Thrill Seeker. Like the others, it’s transfer-proof, can last up to 16 hours, and more, but its precise applicator is what makes shoppers fall in love with it.

“This stuff stays put and looks beautiful all day long! The color is very rich with minimal transfer. Easy to apply and easy to remove with the correct lipstick eraser,” one shopper said.
The fan-favorite NYX Butter Gloss has a black shade, called Licorice; and it’s a stunner. The gloss is a is a buttery, not-sticky gloss that’s perfect for making your pout as colorful and juicy as can be. As for the black shade, it’s smooth, pigmented, and neutral, so it’ll work for all skin tones.
One shopper said, “The NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Butter Gloss in Licorice is a fantastic lip gloss! The color is rich and bold, exactly what I was hoping for, and it adds a perfect touch of drama to any makeup look. The formula is smooth and non-sticky, which makes it really comfortable to wear throughout the day. It gives my lips a nice shine without feeling heavy or greasy, and it’s great for layering over lipstick or wearing on its own.”
e.l.f. O Face Satin Lipstick in All Night is an ultra-nourishing neutral black lipstick that’s infused with jojoba oil, has a comfortable and lightweight feel, and a creamy, satin finish. It’s the perfect, wearable black lipstick!
“Perfect black lippie 🖤,” one happy shopper said. “I took a chance on this lipstick since I haven’t been able to find a brand I like in black. I wore it to a wedding – ate and drank with minimal smudging and only needed to reapply sparingly once or twice. Semi matte, smooth and stays put. It’s worth every penny!”
Okay, so remember when Katy Perry collaborated with COVERGIRL for a series of semi-matte, Katy Kat Matte Lipsticks? Well, they’re still available, and there’s even a black one in the shade, Perry Panther. Not only is it moisturizing and has a semi-matte finish, but it’s infused with shea butter. Talk about the perfect mix!
A shopper said, “My first time owning black lipstick and I love this one. It doesn’t dry out my lips, doesn’t move around an excessive amount (using a lip pencil it stays perfectly still). Of course being black it can be difficult to fully remove but I expected that.”
Yes, MANIC PANIC has lipsticks. They have a Raven Lethal Lipstick in Raven, which is a creamy lipstick that gives of 2000s emo vibes. It can go on rather sheer, but it’s easily buildable and can also easily go on top of another lipstick or lip liner. Plus, it has a matte finish and the ingredients soften your lips.
“Got this for my daughter for Halloween! She needed black lipstick and this worked perfectly! Lasted her all through the night, during her Trick-or-Treating! Would definitely recommend if you need a quick Black Lipstick for an event,” one shopper said. 
Danessa Myricks has done it again: made something so ridiculously good that we become obsessed with it. This time, the brand released a Beauty Colorfix Liquid Pigment in Blackout, and this is the most unique black lippie on the market. This is a waterproof, multipurpose pigment that’ll add the color to your eyes, cheeks, and lips. This black pigment also has a matte finish, making it such a cool product for either daily use or Halloween.
“This product is so beautiful.. the pigment, build-ability is superb! Lasts absolutely all day and doesn’t crease. Looks stunning on the entire face no matter how you use it. Highly recommend to anyone- beginner, expert and all in between,” a happy shopper said. 
The SEPHORA Cream Lip Stain 10HR Liquid Lipstick in Night Bird is a matte black lip cream that acts as a lip stain, making your lips as black as night for up to 10 hours. 
One shopper said, “Love this lip stain although its really more like a liquid lipstick which are my go to’s and first time i buy one from Sephora collection as i usually used the KVD in black briar (used to be Witches)and is equally as good as Kvd if not better as it truly doesn’t budge which i love.”
KVD Beauty Everlasting Hyperlight Vegan Transfer-Proof Liquid Lipstick in Black Briar is a long-wearing liquid lipstick that’s both matte and moisturizing. No, really, it has Raspberry Stem Cells, which are all about nourishing the lips for long-day wear.

We already know that Rihanna loves good black lipstick, so, of course,, her brand has one. On Sephora, there’s the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Fenty Icon The Fill Semi-Matte Refillable Lipstick in Black, which is on sale for only $8. We know it’s refillable, but it’s just as gorgeous. The black lipstick is a creamy, semi-matte lipstick that has so much pigment, and is packed with vitamins for a comfy feel.
