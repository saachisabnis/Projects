Many Rihanna fans believe the mother of two is now expecting a third child.
The chatter got cranked into overdrive following Rihanna’s high-priced performance at the wedding party for India’s richest man along with his son and future daughter-in-law. The “Diamonds” singer was paid a reported $5 million to perform a concert for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant who are set to exchange vows. 
The event reportedly hosted a cornucopia of high-profile guests at the Indian gala. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Ivanka Trump, Hillary Clinton, and more are said to have been in attendance, according to Complex magazine. 
Based on the video of her performance that’s gone viral from Inida, fans believe that Rihanna is sporting a baby bump.

“I know my eyes are deceiving me,” one fan writes alongside crying emojis. “We never gettin music man enjoy what’s on iTunes. Rocky tryna make a village.”
