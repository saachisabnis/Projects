Trick Daddy isn’t the only Hip Hop figure who has tried to woo GloRilla on Instagram.
Last month, Rihanna slid into Glo’s Instagram DMs to ask her a question she admitted was “hypocritical.”

Fans have been waiting for RiRi to release a follow-up to ANTI for almost a decade, but that didn’t stop the Bajan superstar from asking for an album update from one of her favorite artists.
She privately messaged GloRilla saying: “You got all summer sis! I know dis wild hypocritical but when the album drop?”

The Memphis native shared the message in a recap of her visit to the 2024 BET Awards but did show her response to the “Umbrella” singer.
Rihanna’s question had many fans in stitches, with one joking: “Ri asking for an album is diabolical asf.”

Another said: “Rihanna play to much! Tell her to jump on the album!!!”
Rih proved that she’s a fan of GloRilla when she filmed herself dancing to the rapper’s hit single “TGIF.”

In the video, she lip-synced and got down to the catchy hook, “It’s 7 p.m. Friday/ It’s 95 degrees/ I ain’t got no n-gga and no n-gga ain’t got me” as the camera panned to her boyfriend A$AP Rocky.
Confused and amused by his partner’s energy, the Harlem rapper hilariously responded by saying: “Where my drink at, man? I’m too old for this shit.”
