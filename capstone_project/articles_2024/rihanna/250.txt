It’s in Khloe Kardashian’s DNA to pull off a quick hair change, and she just did exactly that. Khloe Kardashian’s ginger hair had us in a chokehold when she first debuted it last month, so we were over the moon when we found out she brought it back. And although she’s stuck by her signature blonde hair for the longest time, this color might just be her best look ever.
Yesterday, Khloe hard launched her new hair color on Instagram. “Strawberry Shortcake Vibes 🍓🍓,” she wrote in the caption. Fans in the comments freaked out over her new strawberry red locks and praised her hairstylist Tracey Cunningham for pulling off such a stunning transformation. We’ve gotten so used to blonde Khloe, but this ginger color definitely suits her better than any color she’s had before—all she needs is a strawberry hat to truly live her Strawberry Shortcake fantasy.

Even though this seems like a huge transformation for Khloe, this isn’t the first time she’s rocked ginger hair. In fact, her first red headed moment dates all the way back to 2011, when she walked the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards red carpet with gorgeous copper hair. And just last month, she donned a similar color for her Fabletics campaign. After the pictures dropped, stans fawned over the hair change and some even urged her to never go back to blonde. (Spoiler alert, she did.) But thankfully for all the ginger Khloe fans, the red is back and better than ever.
Last week, Khloe Kardashian was seen in Los Angeles with ginger hair yet again. Paired with a leather trench, slouchy socks, sneakers, and vintage aviator sunglasses, Khloe looks like the heroine of a cyberpunk movie. We might’ve just seen her with a similar hair color, but something about this look in particular just hit different. Compared to her deep copper hair from her Fabletics campaign, this new color is a lighter shade of red and has warm blonde highlights throughout. Because we’ve become so used to blonde Khloe, her ginger locks are very shocking—in the best way possible.
After cowgirl copper quickly became one of the hottest hair colors, we’ve been taking note of all the celebs feeding us red hair inspo. From Zendaya to Rihanna, and now Khloe Kardashian, ginger hair might just be the most coveted it-girl hair color of the year. And because we don’t know how long Khloe will keep her hair this color (hopefully longer than last time), we’re cherishing these pictures forever and remembering this as her best hair era. So if you’re contemplating going ginger this summer, hopefully Khloe Kardashian just convinced you to make the switch.
