London Fashion Week marks its 40 year anniversary this year, and yesterday saw one of the event’s biggest global names — Northern Ireland’s JW Anderson — show off his latest wardrobe.
Magherafelt native Anderson (39) has established himself as a celebrity guru when it comes to deciding what to wear.

He has created outfits for Beyoncé which she has worn during her world tour and also had a hand in Rihanna’s striking red Super Bowl ensemble last year.
Anderson’s nostalgic Sunday show attracted the likes of Romeo Beckham’s girlfriend Mia Regan, French actress Pom Klementieff, Jane Eyre actress Ruth Wilson, and Sex Education star Asa Butterfield.
Inspirations for the more pragmatic part of the collection were “the woman next door, the nosy neighbour” and even M&S, he told reporters.

His thoughts were about “a time of nosy neighbours and the person looking through the fence”.
Also there at Seymour Leisure Centre in London were Line of Duty star Keeley Hawes, models Erin O’Connor and Alexa Chung, author Zadie Smith, singer Charlie XCX, and US actresses Minnie Driver and Marisa Berenson, and Anna Wintour of Vogue.

Anderson heads up luxury Spanish fashion house Loewe and recently revealed a new global brand ambassador in the shape of Co Down actor Jamie Dornan.
Anderson, the son of Willie Anderson, who played international rugby for Ireland between 1984 and 1990, was named Designer of the Year at the Fashion Awards 2023 and has carved out a name for himself as one of the most inventive names in the business.
