Rihanna suffered traumatic “waves” of postpartum hair loss.
Rihanna suffered traumatic ‘waves’ of postpartum hair loss
The ‘We Found Love’ singer, 36, has sons RZA, two, and 10-month-old Riot with her rapper partner A$AP Rocky, 35, and admitted being hit with the condition was “not on the pamphlet” when she started her journey to motherhood.
She said in an interview shared by Refinery29 to mark the launch of her Fenty Hair products: “I did not expect it to happen in waves, either. I thought it would just happen and grow back.” 
Rihanna said clumps of her hair fell off in different places on her head, leaving her thinking: “Enough is enough.” 
She added about how it forced her to change her style: “I learned to embrace that in itself. That just actually made me get a little more creative and clever with my hair stuff.”

Rihanna wore her hair in closely cropped curls for her launch event, with fans said they found her admission “relatable”.

Her new Fenty haircare line  features $29 shampoo and a heat-protecting styling cream for $28.

Rihanna started dating A$AP in 2020 after the pair were linked professionally as early as 2013.

Their boy RZA’s name is a tribute to producer and rapper RZA, 54, leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose real name is Robert Fitzgerald Diggs – as well as being a nod to A$AP’s middle name.

Along with telling how her hair loss sparked a change in her style, Rihanna recently said her revealing old outfits are her biggest fashion “ick”.

She said when asked by British to name her greatest turn-off when it comes to clothes: “I did so much (rubbish) in my life. I had my nipples out, I had my panties out.

“But now those are the things, I guess, as a mom, as an evolved young lady… it’s just things that I just feel like I would never do.

“And I’m just like, ‘Oh my god, I really did that? nips out?’”
