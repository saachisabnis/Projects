Nicki Minaj's husband is going viral after updating a new photo to California's Sex Offender Registry.
Kenneth Petty, who was accused of raping a 16-year-old girl before being convicted of first-degree rape in 1995, served a four year prison term in the state of New York.
Petty, 46, also received a three year probation sentence in July 2022 after pleading guilty to failing to register as a sex offender in California in 2020, per the Economic Times.
California's long-standing Megan's Law â€” which was referred to by Minaj's rap nemesis Megan Thee Stallion for a diss track â€” is a federal law in the United States which forces public record of all registered sex offenders.

According to the federal website, California's Megan's Law lists Petty's physical attributes, as well as the short description: "261(a)(2): Attempted Rape by Force or Fear."
Yahoo! reported that Petty completed 120 days of house arrest following "very, very public threats" against rapper Offset from the now disbanded Grammy Award-winning group Migos.
Per the news outlet, Minaj, 41, and Petty were recently spotted at a New York Knicks game on March 31.
