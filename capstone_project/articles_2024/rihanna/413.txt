Rafu Shimpo
By ELLEN ENDO
As the nervous and, many would say, disappointing Rabbit slips back into their burrow, the sleeping Dragon gradually awakens. Will he bring his power to protect or intimidate?
“Ryū no hige o naderu,” goes the Japanese adage, warning us against “stroking the Dragon’s beard.”
The concept of dragons was introduced to Japan from China around 300 BC. Since then, dragon images have gradually entered Japanese pop culture, anime, greeting cards, clothing, accessories, and games. They can also be found at Shinto shrines.
As the only mythical creature among the 12 animals depicted in the 12-year Japanese Zodiac cycle, dragon depictions are frequently left to the imagination. Images vary greatly and are composites of different animals — body of a snake, scales of a fish, head of an ox, mouth of a crocodile, beard of a goat, feet of a reptile, wings of a giant bird, horns of a deer, claws of a tiger, legs of a dinosaur.
People born in the Year of the Dragon, on the other hand, are thought of as attractive, strong, energetic, intelligent, born leaders, fearless, and resourceful. On the negative side, they also can be over-confident, arrogant, irritable, and emotional.
Expect 2024 to be more demanding on everyone. As we fully emerge from the restraints of the pandemic, our careers, relationships, and finances will require greater attention. We will have exhausted all of the COVID-related excuses for procrastination and focus on the practical matters. On the bright side, Dragon years are excellent for starting new jobs or, for entrepreneurs, launching a new business.
The Year of the Dragon is likely to bring new energy, allowing fresh ideas to take center stage.
Astrologers predict an atmosphere of change brought about by the Dragon’s fearless demeanor.
Bruce Lee, born in Dragon year 1940, reigns as one of the most prototypical Dragons. Other famous Dragons include actor and musician Keanu Reeves (1964), actress Sandra Bullock (1964), musician and composer John Ono Lennon (1940), singer and composer Adele (1988), singer Rihanna (1988), U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (1940), musician Ringo Starr (1940), basketball star Stephen Curry (1988), and President of Russia Vladimir Putin (1952).
Dragon years have turned out to be landmarks years for Japan. In 1964, Japan’s economy was growing at an astounding rate, triggering massive infrastructure projects including the bullet train between Tokyo and Osaka, and the monorail connecting Haneda Airport to the civic center. 1988 saw Nintendo release the “Super Mario Brothers” video game. In the year 2000, Sony released Playstation 2, which remains the highest-selling console of all time with more than 155 million units sold worldwide. That same year, Otae Fusae of Osaka became Japan’s first female governor.
