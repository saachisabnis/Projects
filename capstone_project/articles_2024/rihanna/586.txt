We have been *obsessed* with her looks lately! 
In case you *somehow* missed it, Hailey and Justin Bieber are expecting their first baby together! The couple, who have been married since 2019, announced the happy news back in May. 
Since then, Hailey has been opening up about her pregnancy in interviews, posing with her baby bump on show for a cover feature with W Mag and opening up about her pregnancy cravings. "I just listen to whatever the baby wants. If the baby wants pizza one day, weâ€™re doing pizza," she said. 
We're also more than a little obsessed with Hailey Bieber's maternity style - joining a line of celebs like Rihanna and Kourtney Kardashian who have been transforming classic maternity wear with daring fits and silhouettes celebrating their bodies. 
So far, Hailey's pregnancy looks have included a gorgeous Y2k sequin butterfly top from Blumarine, a butter yellow tailored co-ord, an XL pale pink faux fur AlaÃ¯a coat worn with nothing but Miu Miu briefs, a high-neck silk shift dress with asymmetric hem and a black lace bump-hugging catsuit worn with a black leather trench coat. 
And now, the style star is continuing to serve. In a new selfie shared to her IG Story, Hailey can be seen rocking a high-neck, fiery red mini dress in what appears to be a clingy, jersey fabric. Hugging her bump, the dress features a tie embellishment on her right shoulder and is styled with butter yellow, point-toed flats. She also rocked a statement "B" pendant and silver and gold earrings. 
Given that she's a coordination queen, Hailey topped off the fit with butter yellow acrylics which *perfectly* matched her shoes. 
We love!
