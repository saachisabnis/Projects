Chris Brown is working double time.
The popular, controversial R&B singer just kicked off his ambitious, nationwide ’11:11′ arena tour — which includes four acts (!), audience requests (!) AND an encore (!) — and is also releasing music videos at a breakneck pace.
Over the past few weeks, the 35-year-old dropped visuals for “Hmm,” “Feel Something” and “Press Me” on Instagram.
If that’s not enough for you, it isn’t too late to catch Brown on the road; he currently has 36 shows remaining on his 2024 calendar from now until early August.
That includes gigs at Newark, NJ’s Prudential Center on Wednesday, June 12, Elmont, NY’s UBS Arena on Friday, June 14, and then Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Sunday, June 16 and Monday, June 17.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on ’11:11′ tickets was $38 before fees on Vivid Seats.
To be fair, that’s for an after-party show in Philly.
All other shows start anywhere from $55 to $201 before fees.

On Nov. 10, 2023, Brown dropped his 11th studio album “11:11.”
The 22-track record, which hit No. 1 on Billboard’s R&B charts, spans 67 minutes and showcases Brown’s famous four-octave tenor vocal range.
After a few listens, we were most struck by the tropical “Sensational,” bouncy “Press Me” and laid-back “Best Ever.”
Still, the standout might be the pulsing “No One Else” featuring Fridayy; its speedy beat and impassioned vocals make for a surefire dance floor favorite.
Make sure you don’t sleep on the Grammy-nominated “Summer Too Hot,” either.

In 2009, Brown had a domestic dispute with his then-girlfriend Rihanna that became violent. Soon after, she was sent to the hospital to treat severe facial injuries.
That morning, Brown turned himself into the Los Angeles Police Department. One month later, he pleaded guilty to felony assault. After agreeing to a plea deal of community labor, five years probation, and domestic violence counseling, the judge ruled that a 50-yard, five-year restraining order was necessary for Rihanna.
Brown is also known for his 2013 spat with singer Frank Ocean, a hit and run, breaking internal rules at a rehab center, assaulting his manager Mike G, and a five-year restraining order from his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran among other transgressions.
Many of the world’s most gifted vocalists will be out and about all year long.
