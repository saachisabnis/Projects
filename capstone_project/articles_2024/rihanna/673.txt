	After netting his first No. 1 record with “Not Like Us,” Mustard is dropping his first album since 2019’s Perfect Ten.

	The Los Angeles producer announced his new album Faith of a Mustard Seed on social media where he posted a trailer along with the message, “FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED SUMMER 2024 A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU. LOVE Y’ALL. SEE YOU SOON.”

ScHoolboy Q has already heard the project apparently and retweeted Mustard’s post with the quote, “Heard it. S— go dumb. LA bout to do it again… LA up this year.” That’s very high praise coming from someone that has already released one of the better rap albums of the year so far with Blue Lips.

	The trailer is a collection of behind the scenes studio footage, photos from his childhood, recent civil rights protests and glimpses into his personal life with a speech from Louis Farrakhan serving as the soundtrack. In the speech, the minister quotes a verse from Matthew 17:20 in which Jesus says, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”

	










	The producer has had five songs hit the top 10 in the Hot 100 before with Ella Mai’s “Boo’d Up,” Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em” feat. YG, Rihanna’s “Needed Me,” Tyga’s “Rack City,” and Lil Dicky’s “Freaky Friday” feat. Chris Brown.

	Mustard’s critically acclaimed Perfect Ten album featured the smash hits “Pure Water” featuring the Migos and “Ballin” featuring Roddy Ricch. As of today, both videos have 500 million views on YouTube between the two.
