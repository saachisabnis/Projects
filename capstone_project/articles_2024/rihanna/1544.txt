	Let’s face it: shopping for well-fitting bras is a journey that most of us dread. Heck, even determining what your actual bra size is can be an ordeal. And if you’re shopping for plus-size bras, the whole process is even more daunting. It’s enough to keep you revolving in your old, worn-out underthings — but that’s a bad idea, too. Believe it or not, you should be replacing your bras every six months to a year (we won’t even get into how often you should be washing them).

	But wearing a bra that truly fits is possibly the most important factor of all, as it helps improve your posture, prevent neck and back pain, minimize sagging — plus it improves the way you look in your clothes and can boost your confidence. All things that are very important to most women, but especially plus-size women. While smaller-busted people can get away with paper-thin bralettes (or no bra at all), the fuller-figured among us have to be a bit more strategic when choose a plus-size bra. We turned to Cami Raymond, Senior Design Director for intimates brand Ruby Ribbon, for some guidelines.



	Bigger busts have different needs in terms of support and, sometimes, coverage (although plus-size bralettes and bras with demi cups and plunging necklines are entirely possible). A few things to look for when shopping for a plus-size bra include:

Wider bands: A wider band provides that additional support and stability you need. “Look for bras with bands that are at least three hooks wide, as they distribute the weight of your breasts more effectively and minimize discomfort,” says Raymond.



Adjustable and removable straps: These allow you to customize your level of support and, sometimes, wear the bra in a few different ways.

Comfort features: Raymond says to seek out soft fabrics with minimal seams “and a design that doesn’t pinch, poke, or cause discomfort during daily activities.”

Silicone or gripper strips: Look for these gripper strips along the top and bottom edges, says Raymond. “These strips help keep the bra in place, reducing the likelihood of slipping or rolling up on the bottom.”

	“Choose breathable materials like cotton or moisture-wicking fabrics if you tend to get sweaty,” says Raymond of evaluating options for bigger busts. “Natural materials are often more comfortable for extended wear.”

	Looks-wise, it used to be that your options for plus-size bras could barely be called lingerie. Luckily, there’s a plethora of plus-size options on the market now that are sexy, sporty, sheer — you name it — and they’re all supportive enough to keep your girls lifted, your silhouette smooth and your bad self looking and feeling fab all day long. Here are 21 of the best we’ve found.

		Plus-size legend Lane Bryant certainly doesn’t slack in the bra department, and we’re especially love this balconette bra with hidden underwire that produces a bit of decolletage without being too revealing, and the band is designed to smooth out your back — genius!

		Target’s in-house brand Auden has a huge inventory of highly rated plus-size bras, and the Superstar bra is a favorite. It’s is lightly padded — just enough for nipple coverage but not so much that it adds bulk — and it’s seamless enough to be worn under a thin T-shirt. The straps are adjustable and the bra even converts into a racerback. “Great breathable material very true to size great and comfortable to wear with anything,” wrote a reviewer.Pros:AffordableAdjustable, convertible strapsSeamlessCons:Some may not like the underwireLimited sizes: 40DD and upMaterials: Nylon and spandexBand sizes: 40 to 48Cup sizes: DD to DDDColor options: 4Underwire: YesShipping options: Standard: 3-5 business days2-Day: 2 business daysExpress: 1 business day (pre-order items only)Return policy: Return or exchange items in new condition within 90 days.

Not with the right strapless bra — a.k.a. the Fantasy Aura Strapless Bra, which comes in plus sizes. “Great support, it really works well to hold you up if you are a large cup size,” as one reviewer put it, thanks to foam-lined underwire cups, supportive side boning and stay-put silicone lining on wings.

		What’s a Demiette? Ruby Ribbon coined the phrase when launching its line of plus-size bras that combine the best aspects of a bralette (but with a lot more support), traditional bra (but not quite as skimpy) and sports bra (the coverage without the compression). They actual bill the Demiette as a “bra replacement” that can be worn by women of all cup sizes.Pros: No wires360-degree stretchMolded cupsLace detail with silicone grippersSweat-wickingCons:Unlined may not be for everyoneMaterials: Nylon and spandexSizes: 32-50Color options: 8Underwire: NoShipping options:Standard: 3-10 business days Expedited: 1-3 business daysReturn policy:Refund or exchange or store credit within 30 days

		When we first discovered Lively bras, we were in love — and several years later, that affinity has grown even stronger. Their bras are meant to feel as comfy as sweatpants but with smooth, seamless support, and the Lively Spacer Bra is its best-selling (and most TikTok-viral) bra — billed as the “no-bra bra” — and it comes in cup sizes up to G. Admittedly the sizes are limited (back size is only up to 38), but if those sizes suit you and you want comfort and support, snap this up.Pros:Convertible to a racerbackNo wiresAdjustable front strapsLightly paddedLightweightThick elastic band for support3 hook and eye closures for adjustable fitCons:Limited plus size optionsSome complain about the quality after multiple washingsMaterials: Nylon and spandexBack sizes: 32-38Cup sizes: A-GGColor options: 5Underwire: NoShipping options:Standard: 3-5 business daysUSPS Express & FedEx 2-Day: Same day (if ordered before 11am EST)Return policy:Free returns and exchanges within 30 days of purchase	

		The struggle to find a comfortable, supportive plus-size sports bra is real, but Girlfriend Collective has you covered. They have a variety of styles of sports bras going up to size 6XL.

		Forme bras are designed by an orthopedic surgeon to not only provide support but help improve posture and muscle memory and ease neck, back and shoulder pain — and if you’re carrying around plus-size boobs all day, you know how important that is. They’re so good, Taylor Swift wears the Forme Power Bra in rehearsals — and that might explain why that particular model is sold out in a lot of sizes and colors. The Forme Revive Bra, however, offers the same technologies and comes in sizes up to XXL — and you’ll be the only superstar demanding to scoop up this one (for now).Pros:Designed by medical professionalsImproves postureGreat for pain managementGreat for people with sensory issuesCons:PriceyBecause of its design, it might be a little tight around the armpitsMaterials: Patented technology that includes eight panels constructed of polyester, spandex, mesh, elastic and more. Sizes: XS-XXLColor options: 3Underwire: NoShipping options:Standard: 2-7 business daysReturn policy:Free returns and exchanges within 30 days of payment date	

		Did you know that Skims goes up to a size 4x? Their “Fits Everybody” Scoop Neck Bra obviously won’t actually fit every body, but it will offer up wireless support to those who wear up to a size 4x.

		If you’re looking for indie lingerie that actually comes in your size, check out Cantiq, a designer in Los Angeles. They have strappy and mesh bralette options that are actually fashionable and sexy, and their styles go up to a size 6XL, which fits up to a K cup, with a band that stretches from 41″-58″. The extended sizes have additional support, like wider straps, but they’re still totally fashionable and, well, hot.Pros:Sexy, sheer option for plus-sizeEthically and locally madeWire-freeWide range of sizesCons:May not provide as much support as some needMaterials: Nylon and spandexSizes: XS-6XLColor options: 8 (some colors are sold out)Underwire: NoShipping options:First Class Mail: 5 business daysPriority Mail: 1-2 business daysRush deliveries upon requestReturn policy:Free returns and exchanges within 30 days of purchase
