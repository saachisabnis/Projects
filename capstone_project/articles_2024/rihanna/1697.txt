The placement of someone’s tattoo tells you more than you think — including their age.
According to 37-year-old Jenna Barclay, the location of someone’s ink can be a great indicator of whether or not they belong to Generation Z, and that statement has caused quite the conversation online.
She posted a clip on Instagram asking “What is the tramp stamp of 2024?” with the text below reading, “What do you think is the quintessential tattoo placement of this time period??” 
Thousands of comments weighed in with their opinion.

With a video amassing more than 4.2 million views and 27,000 likes on Instagram, the influencer stated “ankle roses” or “cursive quotes on the rib cage” to be among the few designs and placements that would single out a young adult.
“As a middle millennial, some popular placements that stand out from my teenage and young adult years include the lower back, hip bone, shoulder blade, top of the foot, rib cage, forearm, inner wrist,” Barclay said to Newsweek.

But now “trends spread and evolve differently,” especially with the influence of social media. It’s much harder to agree on one thing when people strive to “feel unique” before the next big trend.
“There were definitely a few that came up over and over in the comments: the random-feeling sticker style placement of small tattoos, above the knee, back of the arm above the elbow, and sternum were probably the most common responses,” she told the news outlet.

The internet personality also recalled the unforgettable trends of tattooing a mustache on your finger back in the early 2010s or backward writing on the collarbone area, like Rihanna.

Based on most of the top comments, everyone had different opinions.
“Random tattoos on the arm. Not a sleeve. Maybe not even a theme,” one person said. “Just things people like. A flower. A pet. A name. A cartoon. A book quote. And their zodiac sign. Random assortment of images of their arm.”
Another wrote, “Back of the arm just above the elbow, specifically butterflies.”
“Tattoo artist here. I’d say minimalist finger/hand tattoos but not many tattoos in other places,” chimed in an expert.

A common consensus among the commenters was that Gen Z likes gravitating towards fine-line designs and gets them inked on their arms or upper body. 
One compared a Gen Z’s body to a “sticker book” since it’s common for tattoos to have “no cohesion.”
“Small doodles in random places all over making you look like the inside cover of your textbook,” a user echoed.

A 23-year-old from Vancouver, Canada, who requested to be called Mayson, opened up to Bored Panda about her process of getting her two tattoos.
Her arm is where she chose to get them placed, but it didn’t seem as if the location mattered much.
“The left inner arm [tattoo] was my first one so I didn’t really want my parents to know about it cause I got it when I was 18,” she said. “The right [upper arm] one is just there because I thought that place looked cool.”

Young adults care much more about their design rather than the location. 
Of course, not every tattoo is required to have some kind of profound meaning, but research has shown a majority of American adults see it as a memorialization of sorts.
A study conducted by the Pew Research Center showed that 69% of adults — more particularly, young women — got tattooed to honor or remember something or someone.
47% said they wanted to make a statement on the things they strongly believe in, while 32% believed it would help improve their physical appearance.

Similarly, Mayson believes the visual of a tattoo is much more important than where it is placed. 
She fit into the category of wanting to remember an experience, as her first tattoo was of the skyline of her home: Hong Kong.
“At that time, I was about to leave Hong Kong and study in Taiwan,” she recalled.
A tattoo fineline artist also spoke to Bored Panda and said many of these designs hold meaning for first-timers but “after that, it’s mainly aesthetic.”

 Hi, there! I'm a newswriter at Bored Panda, born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. I have a bachelor's degree in journalism from Boston University, as well as a philosophy minor. A few of my other hobbies include dancing, reading, cooking, or listening to a true crime podcast.
My favourite thing to report on includes groundbreaking news in the field of science — particularly marine biology! I definitely didn't do well very well studying it in school, but being a journalist lets me live out those dreams in a different and exciting way!

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.

Why would anyone care?
Why did people care about tramp stamps? Same reason.
One reason I would never get a tattoo is that they are permanent, and I know how disasterous I am at making decisions.
I know I will love it for a few months and after that time I will begin to hate it.
I got the best advice before I got my first one. I drew it myself, and kept the picture on my nightstand so that it would be the first thing I saw in the morning and the last thing I saw at night. After 6 months when I decided that I still really loved that I put it on my body.
I am too cheap to get one. It’s too much money I could spend elsewhere. Even if it is just chocolate. Lol
When I got my first tattoo I stood out like a sore thumb. Until that point, and for some time after, tattos were the preserve of manly sailors and jailbirds. Then, OMG, women (ordinary women) were getting them!! The ones I saw on men were very much of that era and we have gone back to much of that stylistically now. All tattoos are of a style that show when it was done rather than the age of the person wearing it. Unless you've gotten something incredibly stupid or offensive then it won't age any differently to any style that's gone before it. One thing I do think is that they are now SO common that NOT having one seems like an act of rebellion now! But people are WELL aware that they're permanent and they'll have to live with them in 20 years time, stop saying such guff. It's your body, do your thing..
