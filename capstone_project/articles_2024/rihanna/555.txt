The 2024 Met Gala takes place on Monday, May 6, meaning the biggest names in pop culture will flock to the red carpet in their best looks. The charity event, which raises money for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, is one of the most prestigious and fashionable of the year as actors, musicians, models, athletes and more don their finest themed outfits.

Last year, the theme was “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," with Penelope Cruz, Michaela Coel, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa serving as co-hosts. Here's everything you need to know for this year's gala.
This year's event is Monday, May 6. While the gala itself starts at 8 p.m., the red carpet generally begins around 6 p.m. (although some guests may arrive earlier than that).
The actual event isn't televised -- cameras and phones aren't even allowed for guests -- but the main event is actually the red carpet. The entirety of the red carpet will be exclusively streamed on Vogue.com, as well as on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube channels.
This year, Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez and Bad Bunny are serving as the co-chairs for the Met Gala.
The Costume Institute's exhibition at the Met for 2024 is called “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” and the corresponding dress code is “The Garden of Time.” Celebrities interpret the themes wildly differently, so we are sure to see a full range of attire.
While there is no official guest list at this time, there are some celebrities that have confirmed they will be in attendance. The four co-chairs -- Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth -- are expected to attend as part of their roles. Fan-favorite Rihanna hinted in a Vogue UK interview that she will be wearing Fenty for this year's red carpet, and a Page Six story indicates we could see stars like Ayo Edebiri, Lily Gladstone, Barry Keoghan and Olivia Rodrigo in attendance.
