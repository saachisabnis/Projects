"Lemme head to da studio & start working on dis song"
GloRilla has reacted to Rihanna saying she would choose her to create the theme song for the singer’s lingerie line, Savage X Fenty.
During an interview with the Bajan star from an event to celebrate Savage X Fenty’s new Lavish Lace collection, Rihanna was asked who she would pick to record a theme song for the brand – to which she suggested GloRilla because she’s “a young lady who’s still grounded in who she is and where she came from, and I love that.”
The Memphis rapper then took to her own Instagram to re-share the video, with the caption: “Lemme head to da studio & start working on dis song 😆😆 Ion play bout Rih-Rih ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 @badgalriri I luv youuu.” The Savage X Fenty brand commented, “YEAH, GLO!! WE SO SO READY 🎤🔥,” beneath the post.

Rihanna has shown her support for GloRilla before. Back in June, the ‘Pon De Replay’ singer shared a video of her dancing along to the latter’s viral song ‘TGIF’ in front of her longtime partner and children’s father, A$AP Rocky. She ironically recited the track’s lyrics: “It’s 7 pm Friday / It’s 95 degrees / I ain’t got no n**** and no n**** ain’t got me.
In addition, GloRilla jokingly stated that she and the musician-turned-entrepreneur are “twins”. Last year, she retweeted an old photo of Rihanna and Lil’ Kim in 2005 where the former looks similar to her, adding the caption, “Been told y’all dats my twin.”
GloRilla released her debut album ‘Glorious’ earlier this month, which NME gave three stars. “As a body of work, ‘Glorious’ is uneven,” read NME‘s review, “there are a handful of certified hits and a bunch of questionable additions that suggest better quality control was needed here.
“But, with her undeniable energy and beautiful message of girl power, it’s still worth a listen, even if it doesn’t live up to the expectations that her attention-grabbing singles previously set.”
Meanwhile, fans still await news of Rihanna’s ninth studio album, currently dubbed ‘R9’. She has given numerous updates on the album – which will serve as the follow-up to 2016’s ‘ANTI’ – but, this June, she revealed that she is “starting over” again.
Since then, she and Kendrick Lamar have been reported to have turned down headline slots for Coachella 2025.
