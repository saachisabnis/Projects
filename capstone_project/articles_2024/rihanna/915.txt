From collaborating with Nicki Minaj to performing alongside Taylor Swift, Ice Spice’s stardom skyrocketed in 2023. This year, she’s wasting no time taking the next step in her blossoming career. The Bronx native is reportedly set to star in a Super Bowl ad for Starry, a PepsiCo. brand developed to replace Sierra Mist. Little is known about the ad, but a first-look image centers the chart-topping star sipping Starry alongside an animated, lovestruck lime and lemon.
Ice Spice is not new to major ad campaigns. Just last year, she partnered with Dunkin’ to release a drink crafted in her image. To promote the partnership, the New York native appeared in an ad alongside actor and director Ben Affleck.
“Ben Affleck is a very, very comforting person to be directed by,” Ice Spice said about working Affleck for the ad campaign.
“He’s just been in it for so long that I just felt very secure working with him.”
Looking further at Ice Spice’s upcoming Super Bowl ad, it continues a growing tradition during the big game. In recent years, women in Hip-Hop have had a profound impact on the entertainment surrounding the mega event. Most notably, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion have appeared in previous Super Bowl ads while Nicki Minaj and Rihanna have graced the performance stage during halftime. Now, Ice Spice will have her time to shine on February 11, 2024 during Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada.
