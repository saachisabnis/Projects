Nine in ten (90 per cent) young Brits say the 2000s have come back into fashion, with almost a quarter (22 per cent) believing the Noughties would have been the most exciting decade to grow up in, according to new research.
One in four (23 per cent) Gen Z Brits polled by Magners say they would love to transport themselves back to the 2000s if they could, while 18 per cent say that the decade makes them feel nostalgic, despite many being too young to remember it.
The survey also ranks the 40 things Gen Z (born between 1995 and 2010) says are the coolest parts of the Noughties, with the launches of YouTube in 2005 and iPods in 2001 coming joint top (31 per cent).
In the ranking, youngsters laud the 2000s for Harry Potter films (joint seventh, 16 per cent), Big Brother (joint 11th, 12 per cent), Timberland boots (joint 12th, 11 per cent), flip phones (second, 24 per cent) and Pokémon (fifth, 18 per cent).
Seven per cent of young people surveyed also admit they are embracing the pub drink of the Noughties, cider and blackcurrant, so much so that 16 per cent say that cider is their go-to drink.
A study ranked the 40 best things about the Noughties according to Gen Z Brits. The launch of YouTube came joint top 
Ipods (launched in 2001) came joint top with YouTube in the survey of the coolest parts of Noughties pop culture
Other refreshments that give Gen Z a sense of nostalgia include Freddos chocolate (31 per cent) and Capri-Sun drinks (29 per cent).
Half (50 per cent) of the older Brits surveyed believe that youngsters are trying to emulate the style of the decade with graphic T-shirts (joint third, 20 per cent), Ugg boots (joint third, 20 per cent), skinny jeans (fourth, 19 per cent), crop tops (joint seventh, 16 per cent) and large hoop earrings (joint eighth, 15 per cent).
Some of these items are showcased on the current high street in a resurgence of 00s trends. 
But why?
The majority (88 per cent) of Gen Z believe that Noughties TV shows are bringing the decade back to the forefront of fashion. 
Gossip Girl, 2007 (26 per cent), Gavin and Stacey, 2007 (25 per cent), Doctor Who, rebooted in 2005 (23 per cent) and The Office, 2001 (joint 14th, 19 per cent), are among the most popular.
Flip phones were voted the second coolest aspect of the Noughties 
Ugg boots took third place in the ranking of cool Noughties items, with 20 per cent voting for the fashionable footwear
Gilmore Girls, released in 2000 (19 per cent), Big Brother, 2000 (joint 11th, 18 per cent), Breaking Bad, 2008 (18 per cent), and How I Met Your Mother, 2005 (18 per cent), are also considered top class 2000s entertainment.
Music from the era has also been cited as a contributor. Pop-punk (joint 12th, 11 per cent) is seen as a Noughties comeback with artists like Avril Lavigne (23 per cent), Green Day (17 per cent) and Linkin Park (11 per cent) now being channelled into artists such as Machine Gun Kelly.
Beyoncé (joint 13th, 27 per cent) and Rihanna (26 per cent) are seen as the biggest icons of the Noughties, along with Miley Cyrus (26 per cent) and Britney Spears (25 per cent).
Paris Hilton was ranked as one of the icons of the 2000s era (23 per cent). She is pictured here at the 2003 MTV Movie Awards in Los Angeles
Eminem (23 per cent), Paris Hilton (23 per cent), Jennifer Aniston (21 per cent) and David Beckham (20 per cent) are also viewed as icons of the era.
‘This research shows how much the nation loves the 2000s,' says Iain Telford, Brand Lead at Magners Irish Cider. 'Twenty years ago, Magners brought cider over ice to the world and was a staple of good times and unforgettable moments. Today we're celebrating the nostalgia of the 2000s that still resonates with so many.
'As younger Brits are embracing everything from bandanas [joint tenth, 13 per cent] and crimped hair [joint 11th, 12 per cent] to pop-punk [joint 12th, 11 per cent] and waistcoats [joint 13th, 10 per cent], here’s to reliving the spirit of the 2000s and making new memories with the cider that made them even better the first time round.'
