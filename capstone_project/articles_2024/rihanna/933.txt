Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly are expecting their first child together, and it’s a moment that feels both surprising and deeply meaningful.
The Jennifer’s Body actress shared the news on Instagram in a way that’s uniquely her – a photo of herself covered in black oil, cradling her baby bump. She tagged MGK right on her stomach, leaving no doubt about the baby’s father. The second image, a black-and-white shot of her positive pregnancy test, adds a touch of intimacy to the announcement.
Fox’s caption, “Nothing is ever really lost. welcome back 👼🏼❤,” hints at a journey that’s been far from easy.
Just a year ago, Fox opened up about a miscarriage she experienced with Kelly. In her words, “I’ve never been through anything like that in my life. I have three kids, so it was very difficult for both of us, and it sent us on a very wild journey together and separately…trying to navigate, ‘What does this mean?’ and ‘Why did this happen?'”
Their relationship has been a rollercoaster, with Fox describing it as “together and apart, together and apart, together and apart.”
