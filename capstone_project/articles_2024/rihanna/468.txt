Rihanna is turning dreams into reality with her latest role as the new face of Dior’s iconic J’Adore perfume. The 36-year-old multi-hyphenate—singer, entrepreneur, and beauty mogul—has stepped into the spotlight once again, this time starring in Dior’s latest short film for the fragrance, directed by the renowned Steven Klein.
The short film is more than just an ad; it’s a visual celebration of empowerment and femininity, perfectly capturing the essence of J’Adore. “Powerful, dazzling, and inspiring, Rihanna embodies the triumphant and free-spirited femininity of J’Adore through the lens of Steven Klein. J’Adore and Rihanna, a new golden dream begins,” reads the brand’s YouTube caption, encapsulating the synergy between the global superstar and the iconic fragrance.
Rihanna, known for her fierce independence and trailblazing spirit, shares her excitement about the project, especially about working with Steven Klein. “I always enjoy working with Steven. Even with all he’s accomplished, he still has such a genuine, pure, child-like passion for his art,” Rihanna shared with Elle UK. “It’s such a joy to work with artists like him! And full circle to be back at Versailles for Dior with Steven Klein! Dream team baby!”
The collaboration is a full-circle moment for Rihanna, who has a long-standing personal connection with J’Adore. Reflecting on her childhood memories, she revealed, “I have always loved this perfume. My mother worked in a perfume shop, and she used to bring home the testers when they were almost empty. There was always a bottle of J’Adore in the house.” For Rihanna, this partnership is more than just business; it’s deeply personal. “Personally, I feel that perfume has so much power! It can give you self-confidence, awaken memories, and transport you to a different place,” she added.
The film isn’t just a feast for the eyes; it’s also a treat for the ears. Set to the tune of Rihanna’s own “Love On the Brain,” the short film layers her sultry vocals over Klein’s captivating visuals, creating an experience that’s as sensual as it is stylish. The choice of music further cements the connection between Rihanna and the brand, as her song’s powerful lyrics and emotional depth perfectly complement the luxurious essence of J’Adore.
This partnership with Dior marks yet another milestone in Rihanna’s already illustrious career. From dominating the music charts to revolutionizing the beauty industry with Fenty Beauty, Rihanna continues to break barriers and set trends. Her collaboration with Dior is no exception, as she effortlessly blends her personal style and charisma with the timeless allure of J’Adore.
