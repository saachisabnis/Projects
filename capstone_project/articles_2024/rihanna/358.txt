Chris Brown claims he has a few special ladies that he's romantically involved with at the moment. The Grammy award-winning singer alluded to a shocking update in his personal life during an appearance on Kai Cenat's Mafiathon 2 subathon on Thursday night, November 21. In one clip from the livestream, Cenat and Brown were talking while eating a meal when the streamer asked Brown if he was in a relationship. The singer looked up from his plate and cracked a tiny smirk before he revealed he has more than one girlfriend. "Am I in a relationship?" Brown replied. "I'm in multiple." 
Chris Brown did not provide details about his multiple relationships. There's a chance he could've been referring to the mothers of his three children Royalty, Aeko and Lovely. He found out about his daughter Royalty, who he shares with Nia Guzman, several months after she was born in 2014. Brown welcomed his first son Aeko Catori Brown five years later with his ex-girlfriend Ammika Harris. In 2022, Brown and model Diamond Brown welcomed the singer's third child Lovely. He seems to have great co-parenting relationships with all three moms. "I have a co-parenting job that's pretty amazing," he told Ryan Seacrest in 2015. "but learning how to be a dad, especially learning how to take care of somebody else ... I barely know how to brush my teeth in the morning!""It's actually great,” he continued. “It's very humbling. It's very calming. I think I was a lot, you know, rambunctious, very hyper as a kid, but now seeing that 10 times over, my daughter's kind of mellowing me out."Brown is also known for his past high-profile relationships with the likes of Karruche Tran, Draya Michelle, and Rihanna. As of this report, the singer has not revealed the identities of his current girlfriends. There were plenty of other hilarious moments during Chris Brown's appearance on Kai Cenat's livestream.
