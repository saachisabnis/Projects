As The Voice brought to a close its Season 25 Knockouts Monday night, the narrative that was being built around one contestant in particular became crystal clear: “Look here, folks! We’ve got the next Taylor Swift on our hands!” But did the show really? I… was not buying the hype. Were you? Let’s go over the evening’s performances, then we’ll have ourselves a little chitchat in the comments.
Team Chance: Maddi Jane performing “New Rules” (Grade: B) defeated Kamalei Kawa’a performing “All of Me” (Grade: B+) — Kamalei stolen by John | If presence alone could sell a song, I would’ve said that Maddi won this Knockout with ease. She just has that “it” factor that would make her compelling even if she was just buttering toast. But here, though she showed solid range and an ability to navigate Dua Lipa’s tongue-twister, I was less impressed by her than by Kamalei. If you plugged him into an outlet, he still wouldn’t be anybody’s idea of an “electric” performer. But he brought a vulnerability to his John Legend cover that I thought gave him the edge. Even John himself thought that Kamalei’s rendition was “beautiful.”

Team Legend: Mafe performing “Almost Is Never Enough” (Grade: A) defeated Gene Taylor performing “I Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing” (Grade: C+) | Loved the enthusiasm with which Gene threw himself into his Aerosmith cover. But the cover itself? Er, that, I didn’t love. It felt like really fun, really energetic… karaoke. (Even Chance dinged him on pitch issues, and you know how rare an actual critique is!) Up second, Mafe absolutely slayed Ariana Grande’s ballad, delivering marathon-length runs and a vocal that went from velvety smooth to ear-openingly powerful. Dan likened her to a world-class painter, owing to the way that she knew when to dip in and out of vibrato. Whether that’s something painters actually do, I got what he meant: She was good.
Team Dan + Shay: Karen Waldrup performing “Georgia Rain” (Grade: A) defeated Ducote Talmage performing “She Got the Best of Me” (Grade: B) | Well, OK! Karen knocked clear outta my head my initial thoughts that this Knockout was Ducote’s to lose by turning out a vocal that was just soaked in emotion and, at times, so delicate that it called to mind a wildflower sprouting from a dirt road. Gorgeous performance. Following up Karen, Ducote did a fine, growly job with Luke Combs’ hit. The trouble for him was that his teammate had just had a capital-M Moment. Under other circumstances, Ducote could’ve taken this Knockout. But under these? No way. Karen even gave Chance “Celine Dion feels.”

 





Team Reba: Justin and Jeremy Garcia performing “You Are the Reason” (Grade: A) defeated Zeya Rae performing “River” (Grade: A-) | In what was hands down their best-ever performance, the Garcia brothers redefined “tenderness” on their beyond lovely Calum Scott cover. They were in the moment, they were feeling it, and they sounded like a dream made of soft, fluffy, well-harmonized clouds. At first, Zeya suffered, at least in my ears, by comparison to Bishop Briggs on her number; nobody goes as big as Bishop Briggs. There was nothing wrong per se with Zeya’s rendition — it was quite good, actually — but there was nothing to catapult it to (or even near to) the next level… until she hit a looong note toward the end. 
Team Chance: RLetto performing “Stay” (Grade: B+) defeated Alyssa Crosby performing “I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues” (Grade: A) | There may be something about Alyssa that reminds me of a Kristen Wiig character — is it the faces she pulls? — but damn, can she sing. With the same casualness that you or I might order takeout, she powered, and I do mean powered, through the Alessia Cara version of Elton’s classic. In turn, RLetto delivered a completely and totally confident rendition of The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber’s hit… that just never quite seemed to explode. He’s a solid singer and as magnetic as hell, but I wasn’t sure that his song selection gave him enough of a chance to set off fireworks. Considering the outcome, guess that shows what I know (again).

 





Team Legend: Zoe Levert performing “Cowboy Take Me Away” (Grade: C) defeated Jackie Romeo performing “Love On the Brain” (Grade: B+) — Jackie stolen by Reba | OK, so Jackie’s rendition of Rihanna’s hit didn’t hold a candle to Chris Blue’s in Season 12, she nonetheless sang it with a fire and an oomph that said, “You’re gonna love me!” — and I did. Helping her along the way was that she appeared to be really feeling it to the core. Tackling the Chicks, Zoe gave a performance that just kinda sat there. I’m sure the one-chair turn is a sweet kid, and she’s learning, but as yet, her stage presence just isn’t there, and her vocals have all the snap, crackle, pop of a bowl of Rice Krispies that have been left to sit in a puddle of milk for a day.  “I think you’re gonna be a star,” Chance said, with Shay agreeing, “You remind me so much of Taylor Swift.” Really? Zoe’s coach went so far as to call her “a great artist who needs to be heard.”

Zeya really did amazing but I couldn’t help comparing it to Nini’s playoff of the same song that she totally owned. 
Justin and Jeremy really brought it tonight, my favorite of the night, was not expecting that.
“OK, so Zoeâ€™s rendition of Rihannaâ€™s hit didnâ€™t hold a candle to Chris Blueâ€™s in Season 12,”
That should be Jackie btw!
Right you are. Fixed. Thanks!
Disappointing night. Sometimes I wonder if the acoustics are off in that studio when they sing. I canâ€™t believe how they rave about mediocre singers. The poll got it right Karen and Mafe were the best of the night. A few went home that should have stayed, but nothing that was a complete travesty.
Love Chance for his honest critiques. Loved Keith, great wisdom, advisor.
John chose wrong with Zoe, think he was swayed by fellow coaches.
My favs Karen, Kamalei, Maddie Jane and Rletto
Alyssa Crosby was hands down my favorite of the night.  Oh well!
Just an average nite for me.  Some of Maddi’s & Mafe’s notes seemed flat, but so happy that Kamalei was stolen by John!  He was the best of the artists, IMHO, along with Karen & the Garcia brothers.  Zoe was mediocre & definitely NOT “the next TS!”  Everyone else meh.
Forgot to mention that Gene did himself no favors singing that song. Chance called him out for pitch issues too. He’s a terrific singer, sad to see him go.
One for the producer’s once again, the element of surprise just isn’t there thing. Last match up and one steal left ðŸ™ˆ why not have the steal prior? Never happens.
First, Keith was an outstanding mentor. He made such a difference in some of the singers’ performances, and they have him to thank for moving on.
Second, poor Gene! He was one of my favorites, but he totally blew it. I don’t know if he was sick or his nerves got to him or what, but I’m so disappointed. I wish him well, though.
Third, Karen really benefited from excellent coaching and turned out her best performance to date. She wasn’t even on my radar previously.
Fourth, Zoe and Jackie’s battle was terrible! Zoe is most definitely NOT the next Taylor Swift. I can’t believe she won nor that Jackie was stolen when other singers (Alyssa) deserved a steal more.
I really have to say this and I don’t really feel compelled to say these things about singing shows that often because there’s always something enjoy but this might be the DULLEST season of The Voice ever. There’s literally not one singer to rally around and the group of coaches this year don’t seem that excited to be there and just aren’t vibing with each other. Chance the rapper in particular just fades into the background. Keith Urban as the super mentor is also so uninspired and lazy given how many reality shows he’s in. The songs being chosen aren’t anything to write home about too, what happened to power ballads and recognisable songs that the whole family know. Everything just feels so bleh this year.
I think that the quality of singers on the Voice has declined this season.
Just not as entertaining as in the past. Sad to see so much yelling and less singing. (Season 25)
