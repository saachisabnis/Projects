As we close out 2024 and gear up for a fresh start in the new year, today’s show is packed with highlights, laughs, and cultural deep dives. From outrageous New Year’s resolutions to the best hip-hop projects of 2024, we’re keeping it real, fun, and interactive. Let’s dive into what went down on Fusion in the Afternoon on 93 One JAMZ.
Wild New Year’s Resolutions
New Year’s resolutions are all about bettering ourselves, but let’s be honest—some of them are just wild. On today’s show, listeners texted in their craziest resolutions. Sarah wanted to try 52 new hobbies in a year, but we’re guessing she made it to week 3. Kevin vowed to wear his lucky socks every day—but forgot to wash them! And Monica? She thought texting every ex to apologize was a good idea. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t.
Fusion’s take? A goat yoga class might not have been the best “just say yes” moment, but it made for a hilarious story. What’s the craziest resolution you’ve ever made? Share it on socials @KingFusion or @931JAMZ.
Best Hip-Hop Projects of 2024
XXL’s top hip-hop albums list dropped, and the culture came through strong. Kendrick Lamar’s GNX and Tyler, the Creator’s Chromakopia dominated the conversation, while Latto’s Big Energy: Reloaded proved she’s here to stay. From Future and Metro Boomin’s moody vibes to J. Cole’s lyrical finesse, 2024 was one for the books. Text your favorite album of the year to 608-321-0931—let’s see if it made the cut!
Not Headline News
Megan Thee Stallion’s workout plan includes boxing, Cardi B’s resolution to avoid drama is already on Offset’s “to-break” list, and Ice Spice turned Ozempic into TikTok’s favorite punchline. Meanwhile, Rihanna’s baby pics are fresher than your entire wardrobe, and Wisconsin’s making headlines with CBD cheese curds—because who says you can’t snack and vibe at the same time? Not Headline News—it’s like your group chat, but with punchlines!
Snoop Dogg Honors Nate Dogg
Snoop Dogg delivered a gift for G-Funk fans with the release of unreleased Nate Dogg tracks. Recorded during their prime, these gems bring back that smooth, West Coast vibe we all love. As Snoop put it, “It’s like bringing my brother back to life through music.” What’s your favorite Nate Dogg track? Hit me up and let’s talk about it.
Beyoncé’s Netflix NFL Christmas Halftime Show
Queen Bey stole the show with her winter wonderland-themed halftime performance. From riding a white horse to Blue Ivy leading a line dance, the set was packed with iconic moments. Netflix announced a documentary about the making of the show, dropping early next year. Don’t miss it—it’s already being hailed as one of the best performances of the year.
Hangover Cures You Swear By
With New Year’s Eve coming up, we had to ask: What’s your go-to hangover cure? Listeners didn’t hold back. From greasy burgers to chugging pickle juice, the responses were wild. Fusion’s favorite? Jason’s “frosted Pop-Tarts before bed” hack. Text or DM your cure—let’s survive the new year together.
That’s it for today’s Fusion in the Afternoon. Remember to tune in Monday through Friday from 3 PM to 7 PM for more laughs, music, and cultural vibes. Follow @KingFusion and @931JAMZ for updates, behind-the-scenes moments, and chances to be part of the show. Powered by the people, for the people—see you next time!
