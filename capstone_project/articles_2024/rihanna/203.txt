A$AP Rocky's request to push back his upcoming trial due to his scheduled performance at Rolling Loud's next event has been granted. Judge Mark Arnold approved the request during a pretrial hearing held on Tuesday, October 22. According to legal reporter Meghann Cuniff, Rocky’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said that the New York rapper would've been in Los Angeles for the trial over his two felony assault charges, however, the date would conflict with his booking at Rolling Loud Thailand. The trial was set for November 12, but the length of the proceedings would've impacted his plans for his set on November 22. 
“If he said no, you know, Rocky would be here on November 12, obviously. I’d be here. But he was very accommodating,” Tacopina told reporters. A$AP Rocky is heading to trial after he was charged with two felony charges of assault with a semi-automatic firearm for allegedly shooting at former A$AP Mob member A$AP Relli in 2021. They reportedly got into a dispute after Rocky allegedly failed to assist the family of a member of the A$AP Mob with finances. Relli claimed he set up a meeting with Rocky to discuss their issues, but the "HIGHJACK" rapper showed up with a group of other men. Relli also claimed Rocky pointed a gun at him and threatened his life. The 36-year-old artist allegedly fired four shots at Relli. One of the bullets hit Relli's hand. According to surveillance video, Rocky appeared to have a gun in his hand before the altercation happened. Two gunshots were also heard in the video. In addition to the charges, Relli also sued Rocky and Tacopina for defamation after he claimed both of them called him a liar to the media. Rocky pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial readiness hearing is scheduled for December 30 before the actual proceedings begin on January 21, 2025. If convicted, the father of Rihanna's children could face up to 24 years in prison.
