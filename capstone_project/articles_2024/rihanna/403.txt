JAY-Z and the NFL aren’t letting the controversy surrounding next year’s Super Bowl halftime show impede their partnership.
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday (October 15) that the league has extended its deal with JAY-Z and Roc Nation to oversee the annual halftime show, as well as its social justice initiatives.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly praised the company and its CEO Desiree Perez at a league owners meeting in Atlanta, saying: “It’s been a mutually positive relationship.”
He added: “I’m not sure either one of us really spend much time talking about contracts. Jay is happy. Desiree Perez is happy. I’m happy, so we’re all good.”

JAY-Z and the NFL first joined forces in 2019, with the initial deal amounting to $25 million over five years, according to ESPN. It’s unclear how much this new deal is worth and how long it will last.
The partnership was widely criticized due to the alleged blackballing of former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick, who has been unable to find a team since taking a knee during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.

Despite the backlash, Hov has put Black music front and center at the Super Bowl halftime show, organizing performances from The Weeknd, Rihanna and Usher, as well as an all-star set from Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige and 50 Cent.
It was announced last month that Kendrick will return to headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show in New Orleans next February, but the decision hasn’t been well received by everyone.

Even Weezy himself admitted in a somber Instagram video that the snub “hurt a lot” and left him “broken.”
