If you follow A$AP Rocky on Instagram, you know he rarely posts. So when he does, his over 19 million followers jump all over it, especially if it has anything to do with the two sons, Rza and Riot,  he shares with his partner, singer and billionaire beauty Rihanna.
In an August 1 Instagram post, the proud papa sent a Happy Birthday shoutout to his youngest son along with one of the most adorable family photo dumps the internet has ever seen. 
“HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY TO MY 2ND BORN SON RIOT ROSE MAYERS ❤️” he captioned the post. 
The post received nearly two million likes in less than 24 hours, and the comment section was flooded with birthday wishes for A$AP and RiRi’s adorable little guy.
“The sweetest thing I’ve seen all day !!!! 😍” wrote one person. 
Riot even got some love from a few famous followers, including DJ Premier, Michelle Buteau and Affion Crockett. 
Although fans are still salivating for new music from Rocky, who is getting ready to drop his first new album in six years, they can’t deny that fatherhood looks good on him.
 The “Praise The Lord” artist told Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s New Music Daily podcast that being a dad has changed the way he approaches his craft.
“I think it’s more meaningful. I got more to say. I got more personal vulnerable things to talk about and whatnot,” he said in an interview promoting his new single “Hijack.” “I’m really ready to put out a new project and just kind of touch the people again.”
