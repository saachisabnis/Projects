Donald Glover seems like the kind of guy who’s had a life full of interesting stories. As he and co-star Maya Erskine have made the rounds promoting their new Prime Video series, “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” we’ve heard a few of those stories
While interviewing one another for Buzzfeed, one question led to a very fascinating revelation that had the internet talking about whether Glover was once friend-zoned.
When Erskine inquired about rumors the “Atlanta” star wanted to disprove, he replied, “There was a rumor I got friend-zoned by someone once. But I didn’t get friend-zoned by them. The rumor is I got friend-zoned by them. I didn’t get friend-zoned by them. I got other zoned.”
Um excuse me, what js “other zoned?” Leave it to Donald to find new relationship terms we didn’t know existed.
Weird titles aside, the internet definitely had ideas about who friend-zoned him, with most people guessing it was singer Jhené Aiko.
“Donald Glover holding on to Jhene Aiko is understandable,” one person wrote on X.
One user brought another rumored hip-hop pairing into the conversarion, writing, “Jhene Aiko is Donald Glover’s Rihanna.”
Though he’s happily married now, like most multi-hyphenate talents, the rapper/actor has been the subject of his fair share of relationship rumors in the past.
When the guessing game about Aiko made the rounds, the Emmy winner expressed his admiration for her, but also understood her independence.
“I think she’s special. She doesn’t need anyone. Like, that’s the thing. Even if we were together, she wouldn’t really belong to me. She doesn’t belong to anything and I would know that,” he said at the time. “That’s the thing, I’ve never had to deal with that…She’s off in her own world.”
This is all fun speculation, but Donald doesn’t seem to think he was friend-zoned, and he’s clearly moved on with his life, so maybe we should let this one go. There are plenty more funny rumors floating around about him.
