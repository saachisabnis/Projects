The Kansas City Chiefs finally announced the key entertainer scheduled to play during halftime in the final game on their 2024 schedule on Sunday with the news that Kendrick Lamar would perform a live set at halftime on The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The game is scheduled for Sunday, February 9. 
If that sounds far off in the distance, it is, but the Chiefs have a history of announcing guests for their season-ending concert series several months in advance. 
We're not sure how Clark Hunt is so well-connected in the musical world, to be honest, but you can't dismiss the man's methods. Not only is Taylor Swift a regular guest at Arrowhead Stadium these days, but the team has counted numerous musicians among its fans for some time—from Melissa Etheridge to Tech N9ne and Janelle Monae to David Cook. 
Last year, Usher asked the Chiefs if he could perform with numerous friends in the season finale and it was a great show with Lil' Jon, Ludacris, Alicia Keys, H.E.R. and Jermaine Dupri. The year before that, the Chiefs welcomed the one and only Rihanna to their annual February exhibition.
Lamar won the Pulitzer for his 2017 album Damn and has 17 Grammy wins and many more nominations to his credit.
The Chiefs have yet to announce the dates for their annual ring-sizing and presentation ceremonies but those dates are likely to be made clear in the next few weeks.
