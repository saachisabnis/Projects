PARTYNEXTDOOR has ramped up excitement for his forthcoming album PARTYNEXTDOOR 4, announcing the release date of the project while also treating fans to a brand new single.
On Thursday (March 14), the OVO Sound singer took the stage at Billboard‘s SXSW showcase in Austin, Texas where he ran through hits from his catalog including “Break From Toronto,” “Come and See Me” (sans Drake) and a solo rendition of “Work,” which he wrote for Rihanna.

As he wrapped his set, PND used the giant onstage projector screen behind him to reveal that PARTYNEXTDOOR 4 (or P4 for short) will be arriving next month.
“PARTYNEXTDOOR 4, APRIL 26th 2024,” a message on the screen read.
Further adding excitement to the album news, PARTYNEXTDOOR released “Real Woman,” the second single from his forthcoming LP following “Resentment.”
Produced by Prep Bijan, Eli Brown, Aaron Paris and Noah “40” Shebib, the track firmly exists in PND’s lane of moody, made-for-late-night-driving R&B and finds him waxing poetic about a promising romance with a model.

“That’s the type, that’s the type of girl I’d make my wifey/ That’s the type, that’s the type of girl I’d give the chains and the cherry-red GLE/ That’s the type, that’s the type of bitch I’d tell her friend that he can’t do it like me/ I’m so proud of her,” he gushes.
News of “Real Woman” first emerged on Monday (March 12) when Drake announced the song while heaping high praise on his longtime collaborator.

“The real [G.O.A.T.] is back this Friday @partynextdoor,” he wrote on Instagram alongside the track’s cover art.
In an interview with Billboard earlier this week, the Canadian crooner shed light on P4, saying: “This is the hardest I’ve ever worked on an album. This is the proudest I’ve felt. I’m excited to grind even more for the next [one]. I’m in love with how hard you should work for it.”

He also admitted that his love life is to blame for the long wait in between projects, with his last full-length release PARTYMOBILE arriving in 2020.
“I get into relationships and then music becomes second,” he said. “I think I’m going to take a break from relationships, a long break, and just get back to making music.”
