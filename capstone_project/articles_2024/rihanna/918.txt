Rachel Marie Hurst originally aimed for a career in medicine, yet her path took a transformative turn, leading her into the world of fashion design—a field she views as “medicine for the soul.”
She explains, “Fashion offers the incredible opportunity to change how someone feels about themselves. Helping someone love how they look is an incredible power, and that’s what captivated me.” This shift, she believes, is about more than aesthetics; it’s about healing, allowing people to see themselves in a new light.
Her fashion journey took root during college, where she co-founded a campus fashion club. Starting in a small art studio, Hurst and her friend persuaded theater professors to teach them sewing, eventually launching a campus fashion show that became a major event, securing funding and support. This experience solidified her passion and set her on the path to Denver’s fashion scene, where she remains committed to building her dream business, one step at a time.
Fueling Creativity Through Contrasts
Hurst’s creative process thrives on contradictions, drawing inspiration from icons like Zendaya, Rihanna, and Beyoncé. Her designs balance elegance with strength, blending delicate lace with structured suiting or urban streetwear. Through her boutique, M. Bolden, she aims to offer accessible, ready-to-wear pieces that embolden women, whether they’re at work, running errands, or out for an evening.
“Fashion should feel like art and armor,” Hurst notes, emphasizing that each design is crafted to tell a story. M. Bolden, specifically, was born from a vision of accessibility, providing bold, stylish clothing to women from all walks of life.

Championing Plus-Size Fashion
For Hurst, designing for plus-size women is a deeply personal mission. “Representation isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a responsibility,” she says. Her work challenges the limitations often imposed on plus-size fashion, where style is frequently sacrificed for fit. At M. Bolden, Hurst prioritizes sophisticated, edgy designs that celebrate curves unapologetically, creating a collection that exudes confidence and flair.
Part of the challenge is also transforming the mindset of plus-size customers who may feel excluded by luxury fashion. Hurst sees this as an opportunity to foster a sense of belonging, reminding her clientele that style is for everyone, regardless of size.
Being based in Denver has brought both challenges and rewards for Hurst. Limited resources force her to rely heavily on creativity, adapting to a market that doesn’t offer the extensive fashion infrastructure found in larger cities. Yet, Hurst values this need for innovation, as it has encouraged her to think outside the box.
Hurst describes Colorado as a unique landscape for fashion, requiring designers to balance functionality and style in the face of varying weather and a culturally diverse audience. For her, connecting with clients who resonate with her vision and witnessing their excitement over her creations makes the effort worthwhile.
The lack of thoughtful, stylish options in plus-size fashion continues to be an obstacle. Many brands offer limited styles, often choosing either fit or fashion over a balanced approach. Through M. Bolden, Hurst aims to disrupt this norm by delivering plus-size clothing that’s chic and on-trend. She’s also dedicated to addressing the feelings of inadequacy that plus-size consumers may experience, as she believes true inclusivity requires more than just offering larger sizes—it means providing styles that exude confidence and desirability.
“When a woman puts on one of my designs, I want her to feel unstoppable,” Hurst emphasizes. Her message is simple: fashion should empower. She encourages women to embrace their individuality and shine unapologetically, whether they’re commanding a boardroom or enjoying a night out. For Hurst, fashion is about creating moments of confidence and empowerment that resonate far beyond the clothes themselves.
As a Black woman in the fashion industry, Hurst brings a unique voice to her designs, one rooted in resilience and storytelling. Her journey has taught her the power of clothing as a medium for expressing identity and culture. Although Black women remain underrepresented in fashion, Hurst views this as an opportunity to share untold stories, creating space for herself and others. Her experience and background have instilled in her a resourcefulness essential for navigating the industry, which she uses to build her brand and inspire others.

Hurst’s approach to inclusivity transcends size alone; she envisions a brand where all women feel seen, regardless of height, body type, or background. Her work with M. Bolden is only the beginning as she continues expanding her brand’s commitment to diversity and authenticity, ensuring each woman feels connected to her vision.
Hurst’s aspirations for the future are ambitious. She plans to expand M. Bolden’s collections with a focus on sustainable, handmade pieces and further extend Rachel Marie Hurst with collaborations that bring new textures and themes to life. Her vision involves creating experiences, not just clothing, and building a community of women who feel emboldened and inspired.
In both her brand and her message, Rachel Marie Hurst embodies a fashion philosophy where style serves as both art and empowerment, reminding women of their strength and their right to shine.
