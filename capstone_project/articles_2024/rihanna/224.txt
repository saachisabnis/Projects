 After taking a few years off and 2023's documentary-slash-fashion show, dubbed the The Tour, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is back—and back on the runway. Earlier this year, the lingerie brand announced that it would be staging its over-the-top runway spectacular again, with New York City as the backdrop for the show's triumphant return. Of course, with a storied history that includes performances from Ariana Grande (who can forget that viral moment from 2014), Rihanna, and Justin Timberlake, as well as star-making moments from huge names like Tyra Banks (who is returning to host tonight), Gisele Bündchen, and Adriana Lima, the event brought out the biggest names in the worlds of music, entertainment, and culture.

 The brand promised a reimagining of its beloved runway outings, with a promise to be more inclusive and even include a lineup of all-female performers, including Cher, Blackpink's Lisa, and Grammy winner Tyla.

 “The 2024 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show will deliver precisely what our customers have been asking for—the glamour, runway, fashion, fun, wings, entertainment—all through a powerful, modern lens reflecting who we are today,” a brand representative shared with People in September. “We're thrilled to share a women-led articulation of this iconic property later this year!”

 From Olivia Culpo to Suni Lee and more models than we can count, the show's red carpet had the star power to match the show-stopping main event. See all the celebrities that arrived to celebrate the latest Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, here.
