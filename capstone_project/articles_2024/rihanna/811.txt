Members of The Bobby Bones Show shared which celebrities they used to like but then stories came out and they no longer think about them in a positive way. The obvious one they pointed out was Bill Cosby. Another recent one was Blake Lively after all the It Ends With Us drama.  
Bobby Bones was asked twice how he felt about David Grohl after he shared, he was having a baby outside of his marriage. For Bones, the news wasn’t shocking because he expects all rockstars to be living that type of lifestyle. Also, because he didn’t feel like he was trying to preach a moral compass with his life when he secretly wasn’t living that way. One celebrity he feels better about after meeting is Tim Tebow. He’s so nice and welcoming and everything and more he thought he would be and called him possibly the best person ever. 
Amy feels differently about Blake Lively after all the It Ends With Us drama, she saw on TikTok. She also saw a video about how Mr. Beast has been accused by a former employee of rigging his giveaways and competitions so that his own friends/employees win them, which has made her think differently of him.  
Lunchbox feels differently about like Mel Gibson after he said antisemitic things. Eddie felt differently about Tiger Woods when his scandal happened. It didn’t make him hate him, but he was shocked by the news. Morgan feels differently about Chris Brown after the domestic violence situation with Rihanna. Even though it happened a long time ago, she still hasn’t listened to his music and always skips one of his songs if it comes on.  
Other celebrities mentioned were Danny Masterson, Harvey Weinstein, Lou Pearlman, Jared Fogle from Subway, Diddy and Lance Armstrong.
