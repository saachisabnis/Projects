Michelle Williams received support from her Destiny’s Child sisters Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland at the opening of her new Broadway musical Death Becomes Her.
The trio posed together backstage at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in photos shared in a reel posted by Beyoncé, 43, on Instagram Saturday, November 23. The “Texas Hold ‘Em” singer and Rowland, 43, attended the premiere on Thursday, November 21, alongside Bey’s mom, Tina Knowles — who also smiled in snaps shared by her daughter.
Although the post wasn’t captioned, Beyoncé set the video to her duet with Miley Cyrus, “II Most Wanted,” which includes the lyrics: “I’ll be your shotgun rider till the day I die.”
“I try not to cry too early in the day BUT……. My sisters 4ever! 🤍💫,” Williams, 45, commented on Beyoncé’s post.
The Cowboy Carter songstress also shared a carousel of photos of Williams’ big night with the caption, “My Belle.” Williams plays Viola Van Horn in the musical, which costars Megan Hilty, Jennifer Simard and Christopher Sieber as Madeline Ashton, Helen Sharp and Ernest Menville, respectively.

For the Broadway affair, Bey embraced the no-pants trend in a gray ensemble featuring an oversized jacket, cap and thigh-high boots. She accessorized with a black clutch and black glasses.
Rowland also rocked a monochrome look, wearing a fitted, see-through turtleneck dress, fur coat and leather gloves. She shared an Instagram post from the evening on Friday, writing, “BURRRRRR-GUNDY!!”
Death Becomes Her is based on the 1992 film of the same name directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis and starring Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. It tells the story of two women (Hilty, Simard) fighting for the affections of the same man (Sieber), who decide to drink a magic potion that promises eternal youth from a mysterious woman (Williams).

The Daily Beast called the musical comedy “the most fun night out on Broadway,” with the New York Times praising the actors’ performances.
Williams recently spoke to Sherri Shepherd about missing out on the mini Destiny’s Child reunion at a Kamala Harris rally last month, saying she has to make sacrifices while starring on Broadway in eight shows a week.
“I was so happy [to see them there], but at the same time, it was the first time that I have not been able to be in person for something I wanted to be at,” she told Shepherd on her show. “But they represented and held me down in their own way.”
