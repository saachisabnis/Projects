Creative supplier production company, Moss UK has marked its one-year anniversary of delivering sustainable graphics and branding for a variety of high-profile events to London’s Tobacco Dock. 
The past year, Moss has contributed to 37 branding projects at Tobacco Dock, working with clients and agencies including Google and Brand Fuel. The venue has also welcomed notable guests for events, including Prince William, Bill Gates, and Rihanna.
Moss account director Andrew Conway said: “Understanding Tobacco Dock’s layout and character is essential. We use our wide range of fabric systems and print techniques to reflect each client’s brand within this unique space. Each project is like a jigsaw, where every piece needs to fit into this iconic venue.”
Moss earned both a Gold Award and the Best in Show accolade, for their creative approach to the Google Takeover at the 2024 UK Graphic Awards. 
Conway commented: “We have delivered so much by working together in our first year at Tobacco Dock … with plans for a showroom and extra office space to further support our clients, it’s going to be fantastic to see what collaborative, impactful and sustainable branding we can deliver in 2025.”
