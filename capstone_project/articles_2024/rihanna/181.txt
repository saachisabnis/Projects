A three-day pre-wedding party with a concert by Rihanna and bejewelled elephants would be more than enough for most couples before the big day arrives. 
Not for Anant Ambani, son of India’s richest man, and his fiancée, Radhika Merchant. The couple are holding a second unashamedly extravagant pre-wedding bash — this time aboard a luxury European cruise ship.
Among the 800 A-listers who are expected to take part in the three-day voyage are Bollywood megastars including Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Salman Khan, the cricketing icon MS Dhoni, plus tycoons and politicians. 
After setting sail on Wednesday from Palermo they will be pampered by 600 staff during stops in Rome and Cannes, until they wind up in the pastel-hued Italian seaside village of Portofino.
