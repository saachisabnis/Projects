Rihanna’s fans are once again convinced they’re never getting new music.
On Thursday, the “Diamonds” hitmaker was photographed in New York City with beau A$AP Rocky sporting a custom Connor Ives T-shirt dress that read, “I’m retired. This is as dressed up as I get.”
She paired the reconstructed maxi with a neon green Bottega Veneta purse, vintage Dior sunglasses and red Fenty x Puma sneakers.
Fans — who have long awaited the singer’s ninth studio album after 2016’s “Anti” — shared their reactions to her bold fashion statement on social media.
“Rihanna literally said f–k yall, I’m retired 😭never getting an album from a retired queen,” one X user tweeted Thursday night.
“Not Rihanna being spotted wearing a [sic] ‘i’m retired’ shirt.. GIRL IF YOU DON’T GET IN THE BOOTH!!” another eager fan wrote.
A third fan quipped, “Rihanna actually said don’t bother asking me for new music, ‘I’m retired’, lol.”
“Seeing Rihanna in that ‘I’m retired’ shirt broke me a little bit,” a fourth person posted. 
Despite what her shirt said, the Grammy-winning songstress, 36, recently confirmed there’s a new album in the works while speaking to Extra in April.
“It’s gonna be amazing,” she gushed. “It has to be — that is the only reason it’s not out yet. … There should be a show of growth, right?”
She added, “I want to play, and I feel like music is a playground, and I want to have fun with it and show truly where I am at.”
That same month, she also told “Entertainment Tonight” the music she’s been working on is “so good.”
However, a release date is still unclear, especially considering Rihanna basically promised fans new music last year.
“Honestly, it’d be ridiculous if it’s not this year,” she told British Vogue in her March 2023 cover story.
“I realized that if I keep waiting until this feels right and perfect and better, maybe it’s going to keep taking forever and maybe it’ll never come out…” she explained.
Rihanna has actually been trolling fans since 2019, when she first claimed to be done with “R9.” 
“Update: me listening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it,” she teased on Instagram at the time.
Meanwhile, the “Umbrella” singer is also focused on motherhood and her business empire.
On Tuesday, she announced she’s expanding her Fenty Beauty brand to include haircare.
A teaser video offered a sneak peek at Fenty Hair’s forthcoming hair gel, a moisture mask and shampoo and conditioner, which are all supposed to “strengthen and repair all types of hair.”
