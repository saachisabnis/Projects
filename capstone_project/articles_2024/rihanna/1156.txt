Dolly Parton has been workin’ 9 to 5 on a makeup line!
The country music icon announced her new cosmetics brand, Dolly Beauty, while teasing her first launch — lipsticks.
“I feel glamorous on the inside, so I want to look like it on the outside… something is coming @dollybeauty 💄,” Parton posted on Instagram Tuesday.
The photo showed the Grammy-winning songstress sitting in a makeup chair while holding the shade Jolene Red, inspired by her hit track.
The Heaven’s Kiss collection, available on the brand’s website Aug. 22, will also include three additional lipstick shades honoring the singer’s legendary career.
“I like to name my products after songs,” Parton said in an interview with WWD, revealing the others are named Honey Plum, Rosebud and Birthday Suit.
And in a nod to the superstar’s glam and glitzy fashion legacy, the $20 lipsticks will come in gold packaging bedazzled with rhinestones.
Parton, 78, revealed to the outlet that she eventually plans to expand Dolly Beauty with eye and complexion products.
“I’ve always said I never leave a rhinestone unturned. I’ve wanted to be pretty my whole life like most girls, especially country girls that have a dream of glamour,” she told WWD of her inspiration behind the brand.
“I started creating my own little makeup things at home when I was just a kid, and I’ve been known for wearing makeup — usually too much — for years.”
A cosmetics brand certainly makes sense for the beloved country singer, who previously admitted to sleeping in a full beat.
“I clean my face in the mornings,” she told the New York Times in 2019. 
“You never know if you’re going to wreck the bus, you never know if you’re going to be somewhere in a hotel and there’s going to be a fire. So I leave my makeup on at night and clean my face in the morning.”
Dolly Beauty follows the launch of her fragrance line, Scent From Above, in 2021.
And like fellow beauty icons Beyoncé, Rihanna and Blake Lively, Parton is also open to the idea of venturing into the realm of hair at some point.
“I’ve always wanted my own wig line,” she shared with WWD. “But I always loved makeup, and when we did the fragrance, makeup seemed like the next step.”
