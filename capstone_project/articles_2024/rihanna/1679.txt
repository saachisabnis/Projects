One user commented on the post: “Caresha Still Look The Same, Lol! #TrickLoveDaKids.” Lil Duval added: “[five crying laughing emojis] life comes fast [wind gust emoji].” A third wrote: “The 305 Yung MIA and her lil sis to cute man time fly.” A fourth simply added: “No way [crying laughing emoji].”
Trick Daddy’s recent forays on Instagram haven’t been nearly as successful as his photo with Miami.
Last month, he shot his shot with GloRilla by complimenting her bathroom, but fans weren’t having any of his flirting methods.

More recently, the “I’m A Thug” rapper shared that he’s not a fan of Black women styling their baby hairs, as he thinks it’s an example of them trying to look more like white women.
During an Instagram Live, the Florida native had some words for his passenger whose baby hairs were neatly gelled down.

“The white women been trying to be like y’all for 150 years and now y’all doing all the shit the white women do,” he said. “I don’t get it. Them ain’t no baby hairs. You a grown ass woman! And I been seeing girls with them standing up now. Like they wanna be free! Baby hairs leave when you two.”
His passenger, for her part, didn’t agree with the sentiment.
