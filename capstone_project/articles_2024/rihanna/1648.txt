Other labels with multiple nominations include Dead Oceans, Domino Recording Company, Matador Records, Sub Pop Records and Light in the Attic.

	“Huge congratulations to all our talented and accomplished nominees for the 13th annual A2IM Libera Award,” Dr. Richard James Burgess, president/CEO of A2IM (American Association of Independent Music), said in a statement. “The A2IM Libera Awards is the world’s largest award show for the diverse universe of independent music and this year’s event will be the biggest and best to date.”

	This year, the Libera Awards will honor Louis Posen, founder of Hopeless Records, with the 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing his leadership in the independent sector.

	The Libera Awards will kick off A2IM’s annual Indie Week conference, which will begin the following morning, Tuesday, June 11, and run through Thursday, June 13 at the InterContinental New York Times Square.
