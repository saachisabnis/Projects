Alexa can translate and knows dozens of languages.  Add one more to the list:  How to speak GEN Z.
Amazon announced a new feature where Alexa can teach you how to talk like a Gen Z’er.  Just say “Alexa, talk Gen Z to me,” and she’ll spit out some slang, along with a definition.
They added 20 terms to start, and some of them you know:  “Ick” means disgust, “tea” means gossip, “sus” means suspicious, “mid” means mediocre, and “rizz” means charisma.
Here are a few more Gen Z terms that Alexa knows… Do you?
1.  “Drip.”  Trendy, high-class fashion.  Like, “Did you see that guy’s watch?  He’s got drip.”  Or you might even describe someone as being “drippy.”
2.  “The math isn’t mathing.”  It means things aren’t adding up.
3.  “Ate.” Used to praise someone for doing something well, or with style.  Like, “You ate with that outfit.”  Or you could go a step further and say, “You ate and left no crumbs.”
4.  “It’s giving.”  Used to describe a certain vibe you’re giving off.  Like, “I love your outfit.  It’s giving Beyoncé.”
5.  “Mother.”  Someone who’s iconic, or like a mentor.  The example Alexa gives you is, “Rihanna is mother.”
6.  “Air.”  To intentionally ignore someone.  Like, “Why is he airing my messages.”
7.  “In your [blank] era.”  A period of time marked by something distinctive.  Like, “I’m in my self-care era.”
Or… I’m in my never going to use any of these words era. That works too.
