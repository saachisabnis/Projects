Megan Thee Stallion's popular songs often feature the recognizable producer tag "And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it," which is attributed to LilJuMadeDaBeat, a frequent collaborator of Meg's. Recently, Lil Ju got caught up in the conflict between Meg and Nicki during a Twitter spaces session with Joe Budden. Nicki stirred controversy by insinuating that Meg's 2020 shooting incident with Tory Lanez was an attempt to mimic Rihanna. In addition to this contentious remark, Nicki also took a jab at Lil Ju, calling him â€œdoo doo on the beat," a childish insult that Lil Ju humorously embraced.
