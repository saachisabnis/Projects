When it comes to iconic style, matched with maximum comfort and durability, it’s hard to think of any footwear to beat the famous Timberland yellow boots. Launched in 1973 and worn by everyone from Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski to Pharrell Williams in recent years, these timeless boots make the perfect Christmas gift for friends or family members who appreciate a design that’s stood the test of time for five decades – and will last them for many years to come.
At this time of year, when the weather’s turning cold and the ground’s often wet and slippery, Timberland premiums are the ideal choice to keep feet warm, dry and steady. Made from nubuck leather and seam sealed, these classic 6-inch lace-up boots for men and women are designed to be waterproof. They feature PrimaLoft insulation made from ultra-fine fibres, including a minimum of 50% recycled plastic, ensuring breathable warmth.
It’s little wonder the popularity of the legendary boots – which began as workwear, became an emblem of urban flair and street fashion in the 1990s and are now one of TikTok’s most searched fashion items – has endured for more than five decades. But they’re just one of a diverse range of Timberland products that make the global outdoor footwear and clothing brand a go-to for Christmas presents. From clothing such as T-shirts to jackets and accessories including watches and eyewear, there’s something to suit every budget and taste. All Timberland pieces combine their renowned quality with practicality and style in equal measure.
Every winter wardrobe needs a cosy puffer jacket and the welch mountain synthetic insulated puffer jacket, in beige, pink or black, is a gift any woman would be delighted to receive this festive season. The sleek design features 100% recycled down insulation for warmth, and water-repellent technology to help handle even the rainiest of days.
Like all of Timberland’s designs, it’s environmentally friendly, too, created with at least 50% recycled plastic. And the welch mountain puffer jacket for men shares the same cutting-edge, eco-conscious technology and classic style, in options of black, brown and navy.
Sleeveless knits have been a fashion staple for the past few seasons, worn by celebrities including Harry Styles and Kate Middleton, thanks to their ability to add a joyful, nostalgic edge to any outfit, no matter how simple. Snug but sleek, they add warmth without bulk, making them particularly useful for the colder months.
Timberland’s V-neck wool blend gilet, which comes in blue or orange, would make an excellent gift for a female friend or partner. It nails the preppy trend but also offers timeless style, meaning it will be an instantly indispensable part of her wardrobe; one she’ll reach for again and again over the coming years.
Chunky hiking boots have also been one of the most popular trends of the past five years and are showing no sign of disappearing anytime soon. These boots may have been designed for walking but, recently, they’ve been seen everywhere from the coolest parties to the school gates, due to their practicality and style. The new Timberland stone street lace-up platform hiker boots for women, available in brown, beige or black, combine the classic laces of a hiking boot with a chunky platform sole. They make the perfect finishing touch to any outfit, from jeans to a New Year’s Eve party dress. Their versatility means they’d be received just as gratefully by a teenage girl as her mother (or even grandmother).
The boots are crafted with premium leather uppers, a breathable fabric lining made from at least 50% recycled plastic, and a supportive rubber lug outsole, built with 10% rubber sourced from farms committed to regenerative agriculture. This guarantees that their recipient can enjoy the comfort of their boots knowing they’re kind to both the environment and their feet.
For the men in your life, there’s an equally diverse array of gifting options, any of which they’d love to find under the tree at Christmas. The Euro hiker lace-up boots, in yellow, black, grey and brown, have been another Timberland footwear icon since the style debuted in 1988. Designed for comfort and durability, with premium leather, rubber lug outsoles, an Eva footbed and ReBotl lining, they also exude an effortless cool.
A checked shirt is a wardrobe essential for men, and Timberland’s buffalo shirt fits the bill perfectly. Available in four colourways, it features Solucell Air technology to efficiently trap warmth, while remaining lightweight. A built-in waterproof membrane ensures it dries quickly, made with 75% recycled plastic.
