The coolest place to be on a Sunday morning is a car boot sale, according to Gen Z fashion fans.
No longer the preserve of older people looking for bric-a-brac, the sales are now a hotspot for youngsters keen to secure their next Instagram-friendly outfit.
And it wouldn't be a Gen Z trend if fans didn't parade their new hobby on social media, with more than 23,000 videos with the hashtag #carboot currently listed on TikTok, featuring individuals keen to show off their thrifted goods.
Hipster Londoners clutch onto cash and an iced latte as they queue outside Dalston or Peckham car boot sales for their next dose of vintage designer clothing.
And it's not just trendy in the UK's capital: Yorkshire-based TikTok creator Becky, who uses the handle @beckysbazaar, has gained some 200,000 followers thanks to her car boot sale content.
Gen Z-ers are increasingly turning to car boot sales to buy clothes. Among them is TikTok creator Becky, @beckybazaar who made a video showing what she bought for £50 at Skirlington Market in Driffield
Gen Z's new obsession is influenced by numerous factors, including the cost-of-living crisis and sustainability.
Joseph Hagan, Director of Streamline PR, which specialises in fashion, said car boot sales allow for fashionable choices at an accessible price.
'Y2K fashion is extremely trendy among this generation,' Joseph said. He added: 'Car boot sales provide the perfect venue for them to find items that fit this nostalgic aesthetic at an affordable price.'
Similarly, consumer research company GWI found that almost a quarter of UK consumers purchase a second-hand product on at least a monthly basis, with 55 per cent of shoppers stating price as their main reason for buying second-hand.
The research identified clothing as the most popular second-hand category, making up 45 per cent of all purchases, followed by toys, shoes and trainers, smartphones, and accessories.
Joseph continued: 'The cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone, and Gen Z is no exception.
'With the ever-increasing cost of living, car boot sales provide a fantastic opportunity to secure bargains.'
Joseph continued: 'Additionally, Gen Z is highly committed to sustainability and protecting the planet. They are aware of the environmental impact of fast fashion and consumerism.'

'In summary, car boot sales appeal to Gen Z because they offer trendy, sustainable, and affordable shopping options that align with their values and financial realities.'
A quick scroll on TikTok reveals just how many Gen Z shoppers enjoy browsing car boot sales. Holly Louise May, from Manchester, took to the platform to share her findings.
Listing everything she picked up at a car boot sale in Bude, Cornwall, Holly revealed that her purchases included a 90s-style chunky belt for £1.50, a pair of £1 pink kitten heels, and a £5 Kodak film camera.
Elsewhere, Becky, who goes by @beckysbazaar on TikTok, shared her £50 haul from Skirlington Market in Driffield.
Her purchases included a North Face gilet for £35, Berghaus cap for £2, and a crew neck jumper for 50p.
Viewers took to the comment section to share their thoughts. One said: 'Car boots look so interesting.’
A second tagged a friend and wrote: 'We need to go to a car boot sale'. 
In a similar vein, a third added: To be fair, that's pretty decent for only £50'.
And a fourth wrote: 'Car boots are amazing! [I] picked up a brand new Carvela bag for £8.'
Meanwhile, when content creator Krystal Danjou asked a trendy Gen Z shopper for her best fashion advice on TikTok, she replied: 'Never skip a car boot'.

When asked which is her favourite, the interviewee added: 'In London, Dalston... I went there last Sunday, and I was expecting everything to be £20, but stuff was like £5 or £3, so that's hot.' 
It comes after Gen Z declared football boots will be fashion's next trend. Unlike football kits, studded trainers typically only appear on the pitch, but that's all about to change because high fashion has taken on the studs as a key style piece.
Prada released a pair of metallic silver 'Copa Pure' football boots in collaboration with Adidas for a steep £500 - and they're sold out in most sizes.
Football fanatics might consider it sacrilege, but in the name of streetwear, fashion-forward thinkers have now taken to TikTok to style their football boots for everyday wear, from classic pairs to upcycled kitten heel versions.
Viewers took to the comment section of a car boot sale video to share their thoughts on the sales, with one branding them 'amazing'
Designer Ancuta Sarca made headlines last month after releasing a small limited-edition collection of Nike football boots that she'd reworked into slingback heels and knee highs.
The Romanian-born designer took to Instagram to share the designs and claimed to have made them for none other than pop sensation Rihanna.
She wrote: 'Some BTS of the custom pairs we made for @badgirlriri back in January. All shoes are remade from football boots.'
The designer, known for repurposing materials, quickly racked up over 20 thousand likes on her football-inspired environmentally friendly designs.
'Championing an environmentally-conscious approach to fashion, Ancuta Sarca's label offers a non-conformist yet feminine perspective on traditional sneakers,' the brand's website reads.
