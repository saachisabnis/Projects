The best way to effortlessly switch up your style is with a brand new haircut, and now – along with the likes of Rihanna, Jennifer Lawrence and Simone Ashley – Pamela Anderson has unveiled a new set of bangs to close out the year. In contrast to the wispy curtain fringe she wore back in the ’90s, Pamela’s new fringe is chunkier – think ’60s Jane Birkin.
Pamela, who has famously embraced an au naturel approach to red-carpet beauty over the last year or two, teamed her new hairstyle with scarcely a scrap of make-up, impeccably groomed brows and a clean girl-approved pale pink mani. Reuniting with her co-stars from her forthcoming film The Last Showgirl for a special SAG-AFTRA screening, Anderson styled her chic new haircut with a camel cashmere dress by Bottega Veneta and a pair of the brand’s chocolate-brown Canalazzo pumps.
