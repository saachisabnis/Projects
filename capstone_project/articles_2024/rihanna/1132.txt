After all the rumours, "the guns have fallen silent" as the Gallagher brothers return as Oasis for a huge run of stadium shows. See all the details here

After years of rumour and speculation, Oasis have now finally reunited to announce a UK and Ireland stadium tour for 2025. Check out dates and ticket details below.
After recent weeks of reports that the Britpop giants would be returning, anticipation reached fever pitch this weekend with Liam Gallagher used his Reading Festival 2024 headline set on Sunday (August 25) to tease an announcement. The social media accounts of Oasis and brother Noel soon shared the same teaser, telling fans that news would be coming at 8am today (Tuesday August 27).
Now, they’ve launched the OASIS LIVE 25 world tour with 14 stadium dates set to take place between Cardiff, Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin next summer. These will be the band’s only shows in Europe in 2025, but a press release states that “plans are underway for OASIS LIVE 25 to go to other continents outside of Europe later next year”
Along with a new photo of the Gallagher brothers side-by-side taken by Simon Emmett, the band have also shared a short statement about burying the hatchet following the very public feud that arose from the band’s split in 2009:
“The guns have fallen silent.
The stars have aligned. 
The great wait is over. 
Come see.
It will not be televised.”

The band have not yet revealed who’ll be in the rest of the line-up beyond Liam and Noel, but this week also saw newspaper reports claim that “no other original Oasis member is expected to join the reunion” and that “the members of Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds will step in for the concerts”.

News of the tour – reportedly set to make a colossal £400million – comes as the band release the expanded reissue of their seminal 1994 debut album ‘Definitely Maybe’ on Friday (August 30), after it celebrates in 30th anniversary the day before. The re-release comes with previously unheard and abandoned versions from the Monnow Valley session for the album, as well as outtakes from the Sawmills sessions – both mixed by Noel for the first time.
Liam has recently been playing the album in full on a solo tour throughout summer 2024, including headline sets at Reading & Leeds this weekend. His Reading performance saw him dedicate ‘Half The World Away’ (a classic song sung by his brother) to “Noel fucking Gallagher”, further stoking rumours of a reunion when the same song during his Leeds set saw him tell the audience: “It is very interesting init? It is a very interesting situation we’ve found ourselves in.”

This was only fuelled by Noel sharing some rare complimentary words for his brother, praising Liam’s vocal ability over his own in a new interview.
Talk then gathered momentum when Liam responded to online fan discussion about a report by The Times over the weekend, in which the publication claimed Oasis would be playing a string of shows in London and Manchester in 2025 – including gigs at Heaton Park, 10 at Wembley Stadium and a rumoured Glastonbury headline appearance.
One user wrote: “Heaton Park terrible venue for concerts,” to which the frontman responded: “See you down the front you big fanny.”
Another fan commented: “this will last about five seconds,” with Liam adding: “You got a crystal ball cunty bollocks.”
As it stands, the tour date schedule still leaves the band open to headline Glasto 2025 – which takes place the week before from Wednesday June 25 to Sunday June 29. Other acts rumoured to top the bill include Eminem, Rihanna, Sam Fender, Taylor Swift, and Ed Sheeran.
Before the ‘Definitely Maybe’ 30th anniversary tour kicked off, Liam shared that Noel is said to have turned down an opportunity to reunite for the shows, and even suggested that he would “send him a box of chocolates” as an apology for being “really mean” to him around the time of Oasis’ break-up in 2009.
More recently, Liam told his audience that Noel was “still playing hard to get” regarding a comeback for the band.
Speaking to NME in 2020, Liam said an Oasis reunion was “gonna happen very fucking soon”, before Noel revealed in early 2023 that he would “never say never” to the idea.
A dampener was soon put on any hopes though, as LG subsequently argued that his older brother had “done a lot of damage to Oasis as a brand”, and Noel claimed that his brother was too much of a “coward” to follow through with the idea, later accusing Liam of trying to “rewrite history” regarding Oasis’ “dreadful” final year together.
Since then, Noel also discussed the possibility of an Oasis comeback during an interview with NME, adding that the reason why it hasn’t happened yet was because there had “never really been a serious offer about ‘The Big O’ getting back together”.

Liam and Noel have not performed together since Oasis’ acrimonious split in 2009, following an “altercation” between the pair at Paris’ Rock en Seine festival, just hours before their headline appearance. “It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight,” Noel wrote at the time. “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with [singer, his brother] Liam a day longer.”
Looking back on the event that led to his departure in 2021, Noel described them as a “shitstorm”. “Oasis tours were always about the struggle, anyway,” he said. “The incident in Paris, that was just the straw that broke the camel’s back, really.”
Noel recalled how he sat in the back of a car at the music festival after deciding it was time to quit the band.
“And the driver pulled off and that was it. I didn’t feel a sense of relief because I knew there was a shitstorm coming. And there was going to be a lot of nonsense talked about it,” he said. “One of the biggest bands ever imploded, finally. And I couldn’t go back to England because the press had descended on my house and my missus was there with my kids.”
He added: “So we had to kind of spirit her out in the middle of the night and they came to join me in France somewhere. And then when we eventually got back to England, of course all fucking hell broke loose.”
Since Oasis split, both Gallagher brothers have enjoyed successful solo careers and been crowned Godlike Genius at the NME Awards. Noel has released four albums with The High Flying Birds – the last being 2023’s acclaimed ‘Council Skies‘ – while Liam released two albums with Beady Eye between 2009-2014 before finding much more momentum as a solo artist in 2017. As well as echoing Oasis’ success in selling out a huge show at Knebworth under his own name, he has released three chart-topping solo albums, as well as this year’s long-awaited collaborative record with The Stone Roses’ John Squire.
The last decade has also seen Oasis fans kept happy with the release of the now-classic documentary Supersonic in 2016, and Oasis Knebworth 1996 – a live album and film which chronicled the band’s zenith of when they played to 250,000 fans across two nights in the ’90s, at shows that saw 2.7 per cent of the UK population applying for tickets.
