A confidence boost can go a long way when you're not feeling at your best, especially when it comes from the "Bad Girl" herself Rihanna.
Natalie Portman stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday (July 15) where she shared how a comment from Rihanna earlier this year helped her during her divorce from ex-husband Benjamin Millepied, per Entertainment Tonight. The pair ran into each other during Paris Fashion Week in January and the "Diamonds" hitmaker wasted no time in singing the Black Swan star's praises. 
In a now-viral video, Rihanna can be seen telling Portman that she's "one of the hottest b----es in Hollywood forever" as the latter jokes she's "gonna blackout." Rih made sure to let the Jackie actress know how much of a fan she is and that she doesn't "get excited about anybody," so her compliments are from the heart.
Reflecting on the interaction months later, the Academy Award winner told Fallon that her chat with Rihanna "was a formative moment in my life" and "exactly what I needed." 
"It was an amazing experience for me," she said. "I think every woman going through a divorce should get to have Rihanna say to her that she's a bad b----."
