Rihanna faced criticism for her karaoke performance in New York City, with fans slamming her vocals and questioning her singing abilities.
Some fans speculated that Rihanna’s lack of new music releases may be due to her lack of top-notch voice and her focus on other ventures, such as her cosmetics and lingerie brands.
Recently, she hinted at a music retirement, mentioning that God had other plans for her career, leading to rumors about the delay of her ninth studio album.
Despite the delays, she has been working on new music, experimenting with different genres, and collaborating with artists like Alesso and Diplo.
Rihanna’s return to music is anticipated following her partner A$AP Rocky’s upcoming album release.
She is also involved in producing Paramount Animation’s “The Smurfs Movie,” where she will voice the character Smurfette.
