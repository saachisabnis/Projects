“Obviously, music was the thing that got the attention, but God had other plans for me,” Rihanna said, addressing the crowd. This statement, powerful and introspective, led to a flurry of online reactions from fans, who have been eagerly awaiting her ninth studio album, R9. The artist, now 36, has kept busy with her thriving Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin brands, as well as raising two young sons.
Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty event wasn’t just a business appearance; it was a heartfelt homecoming. The “Diamonds” singer expressed gratitude for her homeland, crediting it as the inspiration for her brand. “Coming back home, where the first place I ever met beauty was here in Barbados,” she shared. “Everything about my brand, Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, has been inspired by you and this country, my people, my family, my friends.”
Her connection to Barbados has remained a vital part of her identity, with Rihanna often integrating elements of her culture into her brand and business ventures. Fans noted that her passion for Fenty and her love for Barbados seem to have become as significant as her music career.
Rihanna’s last album, ANTI, released in 2016, left an indelible mark on the industry with hits like “Work” and “Love on the Brain.” Since then, her focus has shifted, and her Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2023, where she performed her iconic hits, reminded fans of the legacy she has already cemented. However, she hasn’t performed much since, opting instead to dedicate her time to her brand and family.
While there is no official confirmation of her retirement from music, Rihanna’s words suggest she feels fulfilled pursuing paths beyond the recording studio. For now, those hoping for new Rihanna music may have to wait and see if her “other plans” will ever bring her back to the stage.
