On Sunday in Las Vegas, the R&B king delivered an electrifying performance with roller skating, pole dancing, and Atlanta rap legends

For the rest the world, this may have been Taylor Swift’s Super Bowl but here in Atlanta, we weren’t watching the game for Taylor, or Travis, or Brock Purdy, or Patrick Mahomes. (Shout out to the Chiefs for that win in overtime, though.) No, we were watching the game for Usher, and not only did he not disappoint, he gave us the Super Bowl halftime show we deserved five years ago.

Remember, back when planning for Atlanta’s Super Bowl LIII was underway, when we breathlessly imagined who among the Atlanta music pantheon might headline our halftime show? Would it be Luda? An OutKast reunion? Migos? And then we found out we were getting Maroon 5, after Rihanna allegedly turned down an offer. Keep in mind—this announcement came in late 2018, a year after Colin Kaepernick wasn’t offered a spot with any NFL team and the same year the NFL enforced a rule (that they later revoked) requiring players stand during the national anthem. Playing the halftime show became controversial, and Maroon 5 allegedly struggled to find anyone else to play with them. Ultimately, Atlanta legend Big Boi and Travis Scott appeared alongside the band, but it wasn’t enough to save what was largely regarded as a very dull halftime show.

So when Usher was announced as the performer for this year’s Super Bowl in Vegas, where the R&B star recently held a year-and-a-half-long residency, I know I wasn’t alone in thinking, “Damn, that should have been Atlanta’s show.” And while watching the incredible 13-minute performance, I yelled those sentiments at my television. Because it was, beautifully, Atlanta’s show. Usher flawlessly ran through several of his hits (“Caught Up,” “U Don’t Have to Call,” and “Superstar”) before “Love in This Club,” where Jackson State’s marching band Sonic Boom of the South shined. Alicia Keys joined him for her hit “If I Ain’t Got You,” and they teamed up for their amazing 2004 duet “My Boo.”

Jermaine Dupri shouted out the 20th anniversary of Confessions as Usher slid into “Confessions Part II,” “Burn,” and “U Got It Bad,” which featured H.E.R. with a killer guitar solo. Skating dancers rolled out for “Bad Girl,” with a bedazzled skating Usher leading the turn into “OMG” with guest Will.i.am. Lil Jon jumped in with a quick performance of “Turn Down For What,” and he and Ludacris joined Usher for “Yeah!”, giving a shout out to the city at the end. We had our Atlanta legends. There were pole dancers. A skating rink. “I turned the world to the A.” It was phenomenal.

But don’t take my word for it—Atlanta Twitter (sorry, Atlanta X) erupted with praise for Usher’s performance. Here’s a bit of what they had to say.

Pole dancing at the Super Bowl. Luda for the Afro out like it’s the early 2000s. A town stomping on stage. Atlanta is proud.

It took five years, but the NFL finally gave us the halftime show thay they should have held in Atlanta.

I'll never forgive the NFL for having Maroon 5 do the halftime show in Atlanta in the '19 Super Bowl instead of Usher and other hip hop and R&B legends
