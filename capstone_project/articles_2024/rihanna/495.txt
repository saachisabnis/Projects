Rihanna has seemingly taken a page out of Beyoncé’s playbook by channeling her inner cowgirl in a new Vogue China photoshoot.
The Bajan beauty was unveiled as the magazine’s latest cover star on Tuesday (March 26), with the cover showing her rocking a bejeweled cowboy hat and matching mariachi jacket.

The rest of the photoshoot, captured by Chinese photographer Hailun Ma, finds RiRi adopting a variety of different looks that “explor[e] beauty in individuality through a range of cultural lenses and creative disciplines.”
“Rihanna shapeshifts between fashion ranging from upcoming Chinese designers including CPLUS Series to custom Louis Vuitton by Pharrell, paired with fiercely experimental hair and make-up looks, art-directed by the icon herself,” the magazine adds.
The cover arrives shortly after Rihanna revealed that her billion-dollar Fenty beauty brand would be arriving in China.

The artwork features the singer sitting sideways on a galloping white horse while holding American flag and dressed in a red, white and blue leather suit adorned by a sash that reads “COWBOY CARTER.”
“Today marks the 10-day countdown until the release of act ii. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the supporters of TEXAS HOLD ‘EM and 16 CARRIAGES,” she captioned the image.

My hope is that years from now, the mention of an artist’s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music, will be irrelevant.”
She added: “This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t. But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.
