While the upcoming Super Bowl LVIII might be one of the biggest nights in sports, it also provides one of the most notable stages for a select group of musicians.
The celebrated annual halftime show, sponsored by Apple Music, has given viewers some of the most iconic performances from some of the most well-known artists of the last few decades, including Rihanna (2023), Prince (2007) and Michael Jackson (1993), to name just a few. 
We may not know which teams will be facing off in Las Vegas on Sunday, Feb. 11, but we do know the artists who will take the stage. 
For more on who has been selected to perform The National Anthem, “America, The Beautiful,” “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” and the Halftime Show headliner, keep reading. 
Country artist and The Voice judge Reba McEntire will sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at this year’s game. Her performance follows 2023’s rendition by fellow country singer Chris Stapleton, who performed the song at last year’s Super Bowl, per People.
Post Malone will be singing “America, The Beautiful,” while Andra Day will perform “Life Every Voice and Sing.” Day took to Instagram following the announcement to share her excitement, per Esquire.
“Peace & Blessings!!!” she wrote. “Performing the Anthem at the SuperBowl yall! Grateful! Thank You God 🤗🙏🏾.”
This year, Usher will be taking the stage at the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show. Just last week, a teaser video was posted on Instagram, which featured various clips of  people singing his 2004 hit single “Yeah!” He also recently opened up about his upcoming performance in an interview with Vogue, noting that it “has to be perfect.”
“I want people who have been a part of that journey to feel like it’s a celebration for everybody, for all of us, from the beginning up until this point,” he shared.
