Pharrell’s first Louis Vuitton show was (arguably) the biggest moment in fashion last year. The spectacle, which drew an ultra-famous crowd that included Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, J Balvin and Zendaya, among many others to Paris’ Pont-Neuf Bridge, broke the brand’s records by earning 775 million views on its owned platforms and an additional 300 million views on press accounts.
The first drop from the much-anticipated Spring/Summer 2024 line arrived in early January, when the French fashion house opened a slew of regal pop-up locations across the globe — and now, just about one month later, the collection’s second installment is ready for the taking.
Building on the inaugural drop’s expressive identity, this second delivery features tailored formalwear in the brand’s new Damier pattern. Overcoats, button-down shirts and straight trousers don the checkered motif in tones of green, orange and grey, and there’s one pair of dress pants that let the pixelated, Minecraft-like version take over. Varsity jackets, meanwhile, boast lively logo patches, and a knit sweater pays homage to the show’s location with an illustrative graphic of the French bridge.
Notably, this latest installment also includes a new version of the Monogram leather Speedy bag in brown. Available in three sizes, the classic, muted accessory marks a departure from the more-vivid alternatives in the inaugural launch.
The second drop from Louis Vuitton Men’s SS24 collection is now available to shop online and in stores. Take a look at the offering in the gallery above.
