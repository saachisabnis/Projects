A$AP Rocky stuns in the new Bottega Veneta campaign with his sons, Riot and RZA. Known for his sleek sense of style, it makes sense why the brand would want to work with him. A$AP Rocky took to Instagram to share the announcement. “IT WAS A PLEASURE TO WORK ALONGSIDE MY CHILDREN & FAMILY X MATTHIEU BLAZY X BOTTEGA VENETA X CARRIE MAE WEEMS TO BRING U THIS HEARTFELT FATHERS DAY PIECE,” he began. 
A$AP Rocky continued: “THIS SPECIAL MOMENT CAPTURES THE VULNERABILITY, LOVE, AND INTERACTION BETWEEN MY SONS AND I, IM PROUD 2 BE THE MAN THEY CALL DADDA [heart emoji] HAPPY FATHERS DAY TO ALL PROUD DADS OUT THERE A$AP.” Famed multimedia artist, Carie Mae Weems was in charge of direction. Bottega Veneta’s creative director, Matthieu Blazy, told GQ that he was deeply moved by Weems’ earlier work. Blazy also pointed out the campaign also explores fatherhood.

“I first encountered Carrie’s photography as a student,” the creative director told the publication via email. “I was deeply moved by its originality, engagement, and social impact,” he began. “Over the years since, I have carried the power and importance of her work with me. I am honored that she has brought her lens and vision to this project with Rocky, exploring fatherhood and what it means today.” Blazy added, “The images show the realness of Rocky as a father and as a man beyond the public figure. What strikes me first and foremost in the pictures is their intimacy.”
Rocky told the outlet that being a father has “changed his outlook” on life. “It’s about putting a different lens on my life. It reflects my state of mind, [and] my taste preferences. It feels mature.” The rapper and RiRi welcomed their first child RZA in 2022 and Riot in 2023. In other news, earlier this year, Rihanna opened up about how the couple came together. “We saw fashion the same. We saw creative the same.” 
“And past that, when we grew up, we ended up supporting each other’s brands and products and creative all the time. I would wear his s—, he would show up to my launches.” She added, “We knew what we’re capable of, and the trouble that we could bring to each other’s lives. We can make or break each other’s hearts. And so, we started dating with a lot of caution.”
