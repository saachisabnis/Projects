	Move over, Barbiecore. Leading up to her latest film, Challengers, Zendaya has been sporting tenniscore looks to tease the sports rom-com. Directed by Lucas Guadagnino and co-starring Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor, the movie features costumes created by Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson — and fashion fans can score the very same luxe tee worn by the film’s stylish star.

	Out today, the Hollywood-loved Spanish luxury house’s special-edition “I Told Ya” collection ($330-$690) comprises relaxed-fit cotton T-shirts and oversized sweatshirts emblazoned with the bold, all-caps phrase across the chest. Seen onscreen on Challengers stars, the four-piece capsule is now available to shop online at Loewe’s website and in stores at the label’s outposts in Beverly Hills, New York, London and Paris. (The brand – along with its creative director’s own JW Anderson line – have been worn by Beyoncé, Rihanna, Dakota Fanning, Cate Blanchett and Daisy Edgar-Jones and countless others.)

	The apparel comes in white and grey melange colorways and in men’s sizes XS to XXL (so you’ll want to size down for women’s fits). The crewneck tees are spun from lightweight cotton jersey and the sweaters are made of medium-weight brushed cotton and feature a ribbed collar, cuffs and hem. Each piece is finished with Loewe’s signature anagram embroidered on the back.

	During Challengers‘ global press tour, Zendaya teamed with stylist Law Roach (who encouraged fans to celebrate the film with court-ready style) for her tennis-inspired looks. She kicked things off in Sydney with a sparkling green Loewe gown with a plunging neckline and the silhouette of a tennis player in action, followed by Marc Jacobs-era archival looks by Louis Vuitton (including two ensembles in vibrant vert hues) in Paris.

	Another head-to-toe Loewe look in Rome called for a sequined white pleated mini dress with stilettos that were finished with real tennis balls, and her London ‘fit was a Wimbledon-esque Thom Browne tennis racket print gown with a polo neckline and pleated high-slit skirt.

	At the film’s Monaco premiere on April 13, she paid homage to legendary pro tennis player and golfer Althea Gibson — the first Black athlete to win a Grand Slam — in a head-to-toe custom look by On. (She also recreated Serena and Venus Williams’ 1998 Vogue shoot for in her covery story for the mag.) in another The following day in Milan, she continued her white tennis dress trend in a vintage Ralph Lauren silhouette previously worn by Cindy Crawford. And for Challengers‘ premiere afterparty in Beverly Hills, the Dune actress made a statement in a fluorescent green Celia Kritharioti gown with a super-plunging neckline and an actual tennis ball below her navel.

	In Challengers, Zendaya plays Tashi, a retired tennis prodigy-turned-coach caught in a love triangle with her tennis champion husband, Art (Faist), and her former lover, Patrick (O’Connor). The 131-minute film features a score by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and frequent collaborator Atticus Ross.
