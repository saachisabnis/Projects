Mariah Carey finished off her Christmas Time holiday tour in style on Tuesday night (December 17). Following her cancellation of three recent shows due to the flu, the Queen of Christmas made a triumphant return to the stage at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, marking the final concert of Carey’s 2024 holiday tour. The show brought out high-profile celebrities like Rihanna, who hilariously got her breast signed by Carey mid-show. In a fan shot TikTok video, Rihanna invites Carey to sign her chest with a red sharpie. “What do you want me to write?” Carey says in the clip. “Mariah,” Rihanna replies. “Whatever you want. Wow, this is iconic.” 
RiRi then takes the microphone and announces to the audience, “Mariah Carey is signing my t*t, y’all.” Carey’s Christmas Time tour was a celebration of the 30th anniversary of her 1994 album, Merry Christmas, and its beloved hit single, “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which is currently experiencing a two-week reign at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
