Michaela Jaé Rodriguez is in her pop star era — and is loving every moment. 
Speaking to Us Weekly exclusively, Rodriguez opened up about the inspiration for the character she created for her debut album, 33. 
“This year has been a really, really defining, eye-opening year for me, and this album had to be a statement piece to what I experienced, what I went through and what this entity, Michaela Jaé 33F7 in the future, is trying to tell me so I can help the people along, their path in this real life world,” the “Green Lights” singer shared. “I cried so much listening to this album, because I was so proud of what I produced.” 
As for her musical influences, Rodriguez looked to her past. “One of the biggest inspirations for me was Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson as well,” she explained. “I have a bit of Beyoncé through performative aspects of it and the sound, and Aaliyah was definitely [an] influence — also the Chaka Khan and the Earth, Wind & Fire[s] of the world too. I just encompassed all those songs that were popular and thought, how can we 2.0 it and how can I tailor it to my story?”
Rodriguez also shared some other divas who have influenced her latest album, telling Us, “I was inspired by the early sounds of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Beyoncé and Rihanna. All of those artists were prominent and pop, and that musicality stood very strong in my spirit. I think it’s never left me and I think that comes with a lot of ’90s kids.”
In the last few years, Rodriguez has skyrocketed to fame — and she isn’t a stranger to being starstruck. 
“Lenny Kravitz kind of, like, gagged me when I was at the Academy Gala,” she recalled. “My friend Darnell introduced me to [Lenny], and he was like, ‘My daughter loves you and I love you too. I watched your show.’ I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ That was one of my starstruck moments. I couldn’t speak because he’s so beautiful, and he’s like, cool beautiful. And also so down-to-earth.”

Rodriguez also told Us about the stars she can rely on while navigating Hollywood and fame. “The profound one was Sheryl Lee Ralph,” she said. “I had been looking at her when she was in Moesha and when she was in Sister Act 2 and the list goes on. She has been an inspiration for a long time. So to know that I have her in my corner — I can call her when I need to and talk to her. It just feels good to know that she’s there.”
As for wedding bells for her and her boyfriend, Stephen Gimigliano? “Me and Stephen have been living together ever since we started dating,” she told Us. “That is my man. We moved lesbian-fast with the move-in, and it’s been almost five years. I hope we hear some wedding bells in the near future, but I already see us as married — we’re married in our hearts.”
