The wedding ceremony is not until July. This weekend is just a pre-wedding bash. Three days of events are scheduled for what has been dubbed “the largest wedding parties of the year.” The final price tag for the weekend exceeds $150 million.
There’s video of Rihanna’s arrival to India with A$AP Rocky. Invites went to roughly 1200 people, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Hillary Clinton and Bill Gates. A source said (quote) “This will be three memorable days with some of the world’s most famous people. It’s going to be as lavish as you can get.” (HOLA!)
