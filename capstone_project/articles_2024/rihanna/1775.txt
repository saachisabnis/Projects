What—and we can’t stress this enough—the hell is going on with Drake?
The Canadian rapper seemed to be hella salty about his non-nominations at the 2024 Grammys as seen in a since-deleted Instagram Story post on Sunday, in which he said: “All you incredible artists remember this show isn’t the facts it’s just the opinion of a group of people who’s name are kept a secret (literally you can google it.) “Congrats to anybody winning anything for hip hop but this show doesn’t dictate s**t in our world.”
That comment also comes two days after Drake seemingly threw a jab at his former girlfriend Rihanna during the first stop of his “It’s All A Blur Tour—Big As the What?” when he abruptly decided to share that he was no longer performing their joint song “Work” anymore.
“I don’t sing this song anymore, you can sing it for me,” he said while being hoisted in air in a clip.
Drake, we want to touch your hand as we ask this: Is everything OK? 
We understand you may still be feeling some type of way over Megan Thee Stallion’s subtle (or not-so-subtle) disses in “Hiss” when she called out fraud rappers who cosplay as gangsters walk around with BBL scars all while dissing the women who get them. (We aren’t saying that’s you, or that she was talking about you since she didn’t name you directly. But we are just saying!) 
But, in the words of Megan Thee Stallion, a “hit dog will always holler.” So if Drake is indeed not bitter about those bars, and how he might be getting perceived as a result of them, he might want to stop acting out. At the very least, stop shading your ex and an institution you claim to value very little.
