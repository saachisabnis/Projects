Lourdes Leon wore feather-embellished mules for MAC Cosmetics’ Viva Glam Billion Dollar Ball in New York City on Wednesday night.
Madonna’s daughter, who goes by Lola, didn’t hold back in showing off a bold, glamorous look for the event. The model and musician styled a leopard-print bustier dress that hit just above the knee with black peep-toe pumps. She wore Agent Provocateur’s Allegrah “boudoir” shoes, which feature a silky satin upper topped with a marabou feather pompom and a glossy patent stiletto heel. 
The Italian-made shoes from the iconic British lingerie brand also come in blush and red editions, and if you head on over to agentprovocateur.com, they’re marked down to $350 from $495 in all three colorways. She is also wearing Agent Provocateur’s Bryoni dress, which also happens to be on sale on their website.

Leon completed her head-turning look with a chunky gold necklace, a small black leather handbag and a swipe of bright red lipstick. 
Over the years, the “Spelling” singer has consistently gravitated towards loud, flamboyant looks.  When it comes to fashion, she isn’t afraid to take risks and be herself and often steps out in sheer and embellished pieces. As for shoes, Leon typically goes for towering platforms, thigh-high boots and strappy sandals with adornments.
Leon’s affinity for fashion started at a young age when she worked with her mother on a brand called Material Girl for Macy’s.  She would later make her New York Fashion Week runway debut with Gypsy Sport in 2018. Since then, she has made appearances at the Met Gala and Paris Fashion Week and starred in campaigns for Marc Jacobs and Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty.
