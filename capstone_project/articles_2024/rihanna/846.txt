The troubling history of domestic violence in the life of Chris Brown is the focus of a new documentary, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, set to air on Investigation Discovery (ID) on October 27. The documentary is part of ID’s third annual “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign, an initiative aimed at raising awareness of domestic violence.
The documentary will explore Brown’s legal issues, starting with his 2009 felony assault case involving his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. The pop star, known for hits like “Forever” and “With You,” pleaded guilty to the charge and accepted a plea deal. Rihanna’s facial injuries, which required hospitalization, became a defining moment in Brown’s public life. However, his legal troubles did not end there.
Since the 2009 assault, Brown has been involved in a series of legal incidents, including another guilty plea to assault and multiple sexual assault allegations. One such allegation, settled out of court, forms part of the documentary’s narrative. The film questions how Brown has managed to maintain his career despite a public record of violence.
The documentary is produced by Ample Entertainment and will include commentary from experts and survivors. “Chris Brown is an amazing and talented musician, but let’s call a thing a thing. He’s an abuser of women. Consistently, unapologetically,” a woman is heard saying in the trailer, setting the tone for the documentary.
A new accuser, whose identity remains hidden, also comes forward for the first time. “I have not spoken about this matter publicly, but that’s the only way he can be stopped,” she says, marking another chapter in Brown’s controversial history.
Following the documentary, The View co-host Sunny Hostin will lead a discussion about intimate partner violence. “Domestic violence is a very close, personal issue to me as I reflect on my past as a prosecutor of these types of cases,” Hostin shared. She emphasized that this issue “knows no socio-economic boundaries,” and that raising awareness is essential to advocate for change.
The documentary promises to not only chart Brown’s history but also to encourage vital conversations about the cycle of abuse and its lasting impact.
