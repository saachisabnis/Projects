On Tuesday, Beyoncé blessed us with Cécred, her new line of products designed to repair and strengthen textured hair from root to tip. And as you can probably imagine, every corner of the Black Internet is buzzing about it. The company’s IG account already has nearly 200,000 followers who are sharing their thoughts on ... well ... everything. 
“Girl not me ordering shampoo and conditioner at 3 in the morning 😪 but order secured!!” and, “Just watching this picture regrew my hair, flourished my edges and depleted my wallet,” were some of the Instagram comments from excited fans who can’t wait to saturate their strands with Cécred products.
Others raved about the oh-so-stylish packaging. 
“Pls! I’m using this as a water bottle,” wrote one person about the unique shape of the shampoo bottle.  
While us mere mortals had to wait for the February 20 drop, some lucky influencers got to try the products early. And the reviews are in:
“This is the best treatment mask I’ve tried. My hair is visibly softer and feels so soft after two uses. I have bleached hair and before my hair would just break constantly. I’ve been using for a month and the strength of my hair has definitely improved. I can’t wait for this to hit the market and I hope I’ll be able to get it again,” said one person about the Reconstructing Treatment Mask ($42), designed to repair color treated, chemical treated and heat styled hair.
“This oil is weightless and smells clean. I also use it to moisturize my scalp. It works well to lock in moisture after moisturizing your hair. I highly recommend this oil!” wrote a reviewer about the Nourishing Hair Oil ($44).
Of course, for all of the praise, there were a few who found something wrong with Bey’s new line.
One of the biggest online critiques is that customers want to see Mrs. Carter using her products. Although there are tutorial and explainer videos featuring Dr. Kari Williams, Cécred’s Director of Education, on the company’s YouTube page, die hard Bey fans would rather see their Queen doing the demos like Rihanna does regularly with her Fenty Beauty line.
“i hate to say it and i hope i don’t sound ridiculous but yall definitely need to take a marketing class from rih or even kim k cause what is this roll out ?! 😂 im not buying any of it honestly. yall really just slapped mother beys name on it and called it a day.. for something that’s supposedly years in the making. i’m a fan but not of this chile.. at least go live using the products or something.. post some stories and be active with the community you’re trying to sell this stuff to. i’m a bit disappointed tbh, wrote one commenter on an Instagram post announcing the new line.
Other critics are on the fence about trusting their tresses to someone whose natural hair they haven’t seen. 
“She’s wears wigs and doesn’t do her daughter’s hair but you want me to buy hair products that she knows nothing about? I’m good,” wrote one user on Twitter. 
Despite a little criticism, we have to believe this comment wins the Internet and sums up how most fans are feeling today:
“if Beyoncé says I’m cécred then I’m cécred.”
