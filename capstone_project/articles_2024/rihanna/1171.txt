Princess Charlotte, the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is wealthier than both her brothers, according to recent data. The young royal's estimated net worth stands at a whopping £3.9 billion, making her not only the richest child in her family but also the wealthiest child globally.
This puts her ahead of famous kids like Blu Ivy Carter and North West, daughters of music moguls Jay-Z and Kanye West. The sources of Princess Charlotte's immense wealth are varied and are expected to grow as she matures and assumes a more significant public role.
Prince George, the eldest sibling and future king, ranks second among wealthy children, while Prince Louis comes in ninth with a 'mere' net worth of £97.9 million. A significant portion of Princess Charlotte's net worth can be attributed to the "Kate effect", a term coined to describe the Duchess of Cambridge's knack for boosting the popularity and often the price of the outfits she dons.

Any fashion item Kate is spotted wearing tends to sell out rapidly, with a single photo of her in an outfit capable of transforming a designer's future. Brand Finance research has named Kate "the most powerful royal fashion influencer", noting that items she wears see a 38 percent surge in desirability among American shoppers.
It's anticipated that Charlotte's influence will follow a similar trajectory as she increases her public engagements as a member of the Royal family, reports the Express. However, the "Kate effect" is not the sole reason for her staggering wealth at such a tender age. As the King's granddaughter, she is set to inherit a substantial fortune in the years to come.
Furthermore, she already has investments, business ventures, and significant land holdings in her name. Although Prince George was surpassed by his younger sister, his net worth of £2.8 billion is still remarkable, exceeding third-placed Rza Athelston Mayers, Rihanna's son, by nearly £2 billion.
It is reported that Prince George received an £18,000 gift from his grandfather, King Charles III, on his tenth birthday and inherited 133,000 acres of land across 23 UK counties at birth. This land, known as the Duchy of Cornwall, is a private estate valued at over £1 billion, established to provide an income for the eldest son of the reigning British monarch.
Prince George will assume control of the estate once his father, Prince William, ascends to the throne.
