This is what A$AP Rocky’s followers came for.
The rapper posted rare photos of his and Rihanna’s youngest son, Riot, via Instagram Thursday to honor the little one’s first year.
“HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY TO MY 2ND BORN SON RIOT ROSE MAYERS ❤️,” the 35-year-old captioned the carousel.
The first slide featured a sweet snap of Rocky holding both Riot and his 2-year-old brother, RZA, followed by a video of the birthday boy wearing headphones.
The upload also included screenshots of the Grammy nominee FaceTiming the little one, as well as kissing his cheeks and snapping selfies.
Riot was all smiles in the final shot as he showed off his bottom two teeth.
Rihanna gave birth to the now-toddler in August 2023, one year after RZA’s arrival — and the singer, 36, wants to give her sons more siblings.
“I would go for more than two,” she told Interview magazine in April. “I would try for my girl. But of course, if it’s another boy, it’s another boy.
“[I’ll have] as many as God wants me to have,” the “We Found Love” crooner continued. “I don’t know what God wants.”
She said the same in a February 2023 British Vogue interview, calling herself “down for whatever” and “open” to a bigger brood.
Rihanna spoke candidly about her “insane” postpartum experience at the time.
“You don’t sleep. At all. Even if you wanted to,” she told the magazine, calling early days of parenting a “headf–k.”
Rihanna added, “Man, you’re a zombie for the most part. You’re just going through the motions, and even then you’re so paranoid.”
The Grammy winner praised Rocky at the time for how “obsessed” RZA is with him, joking that she “sit[s] on the sidelines” when they’re together.
The “Wanna” collaborators were longtime friends before their relationship took a romantic turn in late 2019.
