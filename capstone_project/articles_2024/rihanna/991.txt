 Rihanna is putting her stamp of approval on spring’s It color, butter yellow. After wearing various shades of blonde over the past few weeks, the multi-hyphenate stepped out with a new warm blonde hair color – and a figure-hugging dress to match. The “Diamonds” singer was literally glowing as she leaned into the trending hue at a Fenty launch party on Friday, April 26.

 Unsurprisingly for the sartorial trendsetter, the LA event – which celebrated the release of the brand’s new Soft'Lit Naturally Luminous Longwear Foundation – also appeared to be themed to butter yellow. Rihanna matched with the gold carpet as she posed for the cameras in a textured bodycon strapless nude dress that featured a structured sweetheart neckline and a corset bodice that flared out into a midi-length pencil skirt. 

 Rihanna’s mustard strappy sandal heels zigzagged up her legs, bringing some texture to the monochromatic look. She added some shine with layers of sparkly silver bracelets, chunky silver earrings, and two statement rings.

 The Savage x Fenty designer, who’s recently been rocking various shades of blonde at events like Coachella and Fenty x Puma launches, went for a buttery warm hue that complemented her dress on Friday. Rihanna styled her long sleek locks with a deep side part, and kept her makeup simple with a glossy berry lipstick and matching blush. She accentuated her green eyes with a shimmery light brown eyeshadow and thick lashes.

 While Rihanna has been gravitating towards lighter locks, she hinted that she might be ready for something new at the event. “I get bored, and I need to move on to something, or I'm going to crawl out of my body,” she told Allure on the red carpet. “Tomorrow, I'm not going to have this hairstyle and my hairstylist is going to be mad about it.”Rihanna’s mustard strappy sandal heels zigzagged up her legs, bringing some texture to the monochromatic look.
