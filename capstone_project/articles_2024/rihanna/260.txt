Think big, start smalls
You want to restock your wardrobe with all the usual cool clothes for men. Good. But the best gear is nothing without the best men's underwear. It's your foundation. So, makes sense to make sure they're rock solid.  
Know that not all men's underwear is made equal. Because neither are the men who fill them. While some builds can pull off thigh skimming boxer shorts, others are better suited to briefs; others, boxer briefs (more on that later). Generally speaking, shorter guys should avoid horizontal stripes. They can cut you off, and make you look even shorter. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but representing your true height is beneficial just in terms of proportion and not looking odd. 
Baggy boxer shorts can have the same effect too. But if you're taller, and skinnier, it's these very baggy old school boxers that can create the illusion of a few extra pounds. And, finally, those graced with oxen thighs should close in on the fabric with a boxer brief. It'll flatter what was so painfully gained in the squat rack.  
Getting the best men's underwear isn't just about looking good, either. It's the right thing to do. In an interview with The Huffington Post, NYU's professor of microbiology and pathology Philip Tierno advised an annual refresh, because the very business of shreddies-wearing can be an unsanitary one. You don't need a PhD to guess why.
So 2024 is your year of the best men's underwear, then. Don't just stick to what you know either. Because, funnily enough, what you know might be all wrong. If you haven't been stocking up on organic cotton, you're missing a trick. It is durable, breathable and can withstand several washes in the drum; especially important when you factor in all the usual rough and tumble dryer. That also takes fabrics like nylon off the menu. Sure, it's even tougher than cotton, but it is not so great for ventilation. And no, we won't get into why that's such an important part of buying the best men's underwear. 
Put it this way: if you feel good, you'll look good. You can't put a price on that sort of confidence. Last year's rags won't give you that, either –  but a pair of some of the best men's underwear most definitely will.
Men's underwear needs washing. It really does. But too much washing can ruin your men's underwear. So what gives? As the experts have long argued, men's underwear isn't built to last forever. It's not a hoody you've had since university. Nor is it the same as your favourite go-to suit. Underwear takes a regular beating at hot temperatures – both in and out of the washing machine – and cotton ultimately breaks down with so much use. When a waistband starts coming away, prepare to bid farewell.
There are ways to extend the lifespan, though. Dialling down the heat of your washing machine can work, and 40 degree washes are just as good as cleaning clothes (unless there are some stains, and if that's the case, they should be thrown out completely). Know that underwear should be washed with likeminded kit. It might be more convenient to bang in your smalls, towels and denim all at once, but the fabric friction can cause damage to weaker materials – and the lovely organic cotton of your brand new boxer shorts are some of the weakest in the drum. 
Then, when that's all done, eschew the tumble dyer. Air drying either outside or on a clothes horse is a much gentler alternative to a spinning, angry, red hot barrel (and your utility bill too). Plus, there's always that fresh smell the nice lady on advert gets when she buries her grinning face into clean, dry laundry, because that's a totally normal thing to do.
So we've covered organic cotton. It's breathable, and is grown without a bucket of pesticides, which is always nice. But know that it's not your only option. Some fabrics are better utilised for different situations, too.
"Natural and sustainable fibres such as Tencel are long lasting, and they provide other functions: moisture management, fast drying, lightness and so on," says Claudia Brugger of Hanro's product management division. Since the early 20th century, the brand has made really great nightwear and loungewear with a focus on the classics – which is also an important variable in the big men's underwear debate. "Long-lasting is a word that also applies to the design. Our philosophy: less is more."
Above all else though, Brugger advises that your own comfort should take priority over specific styles or shapes. "Men are usually practical shoppers, so in addition to underwear fitting well, it has to be comfortable to wear, and also easy to maintain. Put the comfort and feel of your underwear above all else."  
Few pairs will beat silk in that department. In terms of comfort, there's nothing quite like it – and there's nothing comparable price wise. For silk, expect to pay more, and search more as many underwear brands can still offer top level 'mmmmmm' feelings using cheaper (and often eco-friendlier) fabrics. Plus, it's more susceptible to heat damage and general wear and tear, making it one of the few instances in which 'buy pricey, buy once' is a big fat lie. 
Oh, and avoid nylon. There's no breathability whatsoever. It's as natural as a bottle of Mountain Dew. It'll cultivate a fertile promised land for bacteria and infections. And that really is the last thing we need right now. But, thankfully, our edit of the best men's underwear passes all of these checks – and more.  
Best brands: CXP, Lululemon, Under Armour
Best for: Guys that don't want a hard, hard workout to ruin their soft, soft pants
Best example: Anyone with a Men's Health subscription.
A proper workout puts strain upon certain areas of your body that regular day-to-day activity doesn't hit. That's the point. But most men's underwear is designed purely, and solely, for the day-to-day. Soft cotton seams aren't built for muscle trembling squats. Worse still, any sort of rigorous cardio can elicit the sort of chafing that'll bring a whole new level of soreness to your recovery period. 
CXP's founder Tom Austin began to formulate a balm. "We've had experiences of working with Premier League players who were getting Primark underwear from the kit man. They suffered mid-game chafing and broken skin – incredible when you consider the innovation involved with team strips and boots," he says.  "Sports specific underwear such as CXP is specifically designed to improve sports performance by actively supporting key areas which ordinary underwear doesn’t do."
Austin knows what makes for sound workout men's underwear, then. One: you should be able to move freely. Obvious enough. But it should also be intuitive. "[The underwear] should move with, not against, your body. So go for seamless construction, compact waistbands and also consider inseam length and which garment shape works best for your specific workout or sport."

Best brands: Hanro, Falke, CDLP
Best for: Slighter frames, or trimmer frames, or both. Trunks can work for most guys, to be honest
Best example: Shawn Mendes in that sweltering Calvin Klein ad
Don't get trunks confused with boxer briefs. We'll get to that in due course. These particular pants are arguably the best men's underwear because they combine the finest parts of its compatriots. There's all the compact, flattering snugness of the brief. There's the shape of a boxer, which is a little more modern. But, ultimately, trunks are engineered to slip right under your clothes.
You can thank the leg length. In the underwearld, trunks (like the swimwear) finish just below the crease where thigh meets pelvis. No more fabric riding up, but not quite super tighty whities either. 
That means you can wear jeans, chinos, shorts, whatever, and you can do so without fear of chafing – a lot of which can happen during the clammier, grosser, warmer months. Trunks will make your legs look good, too. By cutting off at the widest possible point on the thigh, there's an illusion of a bigger, meatier leg no matter how heavy you squat (or not). 
Still unsure? Don't worry. Stick with us. Trunks, generally speaking, offer a lower rise waistband. So where fabric eschews twisting and discomfort down below, trunks offer the same luxury at waist height. Plus, it's another way to flatter the perfect abs you've no doubt farmed in lockdown.

Best brands: Emporio Armani, Tom Ford, Orlebar Brown
Best for: Chunkier thighs, rugby player types, Jacquemus models (or maybe all three)
Best example: Magic Mike, and all those other strapping lads in an amateur rugby club charity calendar.
The classic brief: a tale of two cities – one of which is having more sex than a retired HBO series about four single New Yorkers. In this camp, the brief is an artefact of that largely Italian strain of prurience, all tied together in a tight and comfortable package south of a big brand waistband (and often seen on silk sheets and silkier advertising campaigns). In the other, it's a sensible, no frills option that was lifted from mummy's boy territory into retrocool waters by the likes of American Apparel, and other nodders to the Seventies.
Both approaches are absolutely fine, and the brief is a happy juncture between each aesthetic. What's more, its benefits are myriad. As the brief is largely defined by its cropped style that exposes most of the leg, it is ideal for those that have plenty of mass in those parts. But on the other hand, shorter guys stand to benefit: more leg exposed creates the illusion of a longer leg and a longer man.  
Let us be clear, too. When things are snugly compacted, they can also look bigger. You work it out.

Best for: Slighter frames and smaller thighs

Boxer shorts are the classic sort of underwear worn by classic cinema's husbands – the sort that returned late and thought it sensible to remove their trousers before hat or tie. Yes, loose, baggy and light has been in favour for decades, and with good reason. However, know that there are a few downsides, too (and not just Don Draper's).
While the cut allows for breathability and the closest thing to natural AC down below, there's a distinct lack of structure. That makes them an uncomfortable companion to closer-fitting trousers, and worse, can cause gathering around the crotch that'll make you walk funny and prompt regular rearrangements (a frown in the company of friends, an employment tribunal in the office).
But! There is good! While boxer shorts don't always lend themselves well to the everyday, slimmer guys have less chance to chafe and upset the pants-to-trouser ratio. And, as the providers of cool, cool air, it's the best men's underwear for relaxing, sleeping and lounging around. We're all doing a lot of that of late.

Not quite the let-loose feel of a boxer short, but not as compact as the brief, the boxer brief (you guessed it) gets the formula just right and as such, has become something of a go-to for countless men. "No matter what, underwear can be and should be the most important part of any wardrobe, and investing in soft and comfortable underwear kick starts your day right," says Mr Porter's buying manager, David Morris. "The shorter length style of the boxer brief gives a snug fit around to the top of your leg, and makes them ideal to wear beneath slim suit trousers or skinny jeans."
What's more, the fabric gives it a bit of stretch, which is important for several reasons. Where boxer shorts aren't known for their elasticity, those with more curvature can find them unforgiving. The same for briefs, where there's stretch, but so little fabric to actually cover things. The boxer brief gets that just right. Plus, there are a few things to look out for. "Investing in multipacks is convenient and usually better value when reinvigorating your top draw selection. Having multiple pairs will not only make getting dressed in the AM easier, but you know there will always be a pair available," says Morris. "Buy practical colours, and stick to blacks, navys and greys. The dark colourways are much more classic."
If you're a convert, know that you're not alone. "Boxer briefs continue to be our most popular style," says Morris. "Across our top ten selling underwear products, a big majority are this style, along with trunks. Luxury brands such as Celine and Tom Ford have started designing these shorter styles from recent collections, and they're becoming increasingly popular with huge site views on Mr Porter."

Need pants built for adventure? Step right this way. This Cornish company formed in a flat above a surf shop in the tiny town of St Agnes back in 2003, and was from the very beginning its kit was designed with a focus on keeping you toasty warm. It's pretty nippy down there with the Atlantic waves rolling in, and if you're hasty with your underwear selection then you'll know about it. 
So, the high-grade comfort in their boxers and long-johns (look, it's really cold down there) is matched with warmth and a hardwearing construction. The bumph for their Eddie 2.0 pants – superfine merino wool, breathable, naturally antibacterial, odour resistant – reckons that they're good to wear for multiple days in a row without washing. We wouldn't advise, but quite a vote of confidence.   
Where many men's underwear marques cater to the Abercrombie & Fitch bods, UnderGents stands out in its mission to look and feel great on the average figure. The Arizona-born label believes that its undies are – amongst other things – more supportive and flattering and less restrictive and irritating than most others on the market; such confidence is born out of the time spent meticulously inventing and innovating its designs. 
Key details that make UnderGents briefs and boxers distinctive include flat lock seams that are smooth to the touch, a contoured front pouch, a seam-free rear, and flexible panels that move with the body. Not to mention that each and every pair is crafted from the brand’s unique CloudSoft micro-modal, a sustainable tree-based fibre said to be softer than cotton and able to wick away moisture without trapping bacteria. 
Ron Dorff – an 11-year-old menswear label that merges Swedish functionality with French style – is a dependable go-to for frill-free, logo-free, gimmick-free underwear. And no matter your desired style (remember: it’s perfectly acceptable to be a Y-Fronts guy), there are ample undies for you to pick from in an array of timeless colours.
Those without a preference for a specific silhouette are best off opting for Ron Dorff’s boxer briefs. Inspired by a model invented for the Swedish Army in the Seventies, each is made with first-rate jersey cotton and designed with a tapered fit and reinforced top stitching.

Anonymous Ism boxers exist to be desired. A want rather than a need. And the main draw (pun not intended) is that each pair designed by the Tokyo outfit is brought to life by a chic, wholesome pattern that – more often than not – has its genesis in historical Japanese art, fashion or design.
Bearing this in mind, Anonymous Ism boxers are just the ticket for those looking to treat a style-savvy beau/brother/son to some undies they’ll genuinely look forward to wearing. And if you're feeling exceptionally generous, you could also throw in a pair of the brand's highly esteemed socks.

Smartwool, a brand born from a love of outdoor adventures (skiing, particularly), has been keeping people’s sensitive spots warm with its base layers ever since the mid-Nineties. The label predominantly works with Merino wool to produce its goods (hence the name) as the fabric is odour-neutralising, moisture-wicking, thermoregulating, durable, soft and sustainable. 
Smartwool has been particularly successful with its undies line, comprising briefs, boxers and boxer briefs in sundry patterns and colours. Some are of a slim-fit, some offer extra support, some are constructed from a Merino wool-hemp blend, and some are said to eliminate chafing. Ergo, Smartwool has you quite literally covered, regardless of your underwear preferences.

Charles Sébline’s eponymous marque, known for bridging the gap between British and Parisian style, has been trying its hand at underwear as of late. Thus far, the boxers have been just as tasteful as the season-less shirts the brand is renowned for, from the block-coloured styles to the floral patterned styles.
And since each pair is crafted from the same crisp cotton as the rest of the label's offerings, they also work as shorts. In fact, Sébline – along with its retailers, Ssense and Mr Porter included – actively encourage consumers to wear the boxers as an outer layer during the spring and the summer, because they’re long, cosy, relaxed and coordinate well with the brand’s most popular button-ups.

Yes, obviously you already know Sunspel. You know them because they do probably the best white t-shirt around, and because they make them in their own factory right here in the UK. You know them because they do luxury stuff you use everyday. So why, then, are you unaware of their extremely nice underwear? Sunspel introduced the boxer short to Britain in 1947 and kicked off a very comfy kind of revolution. Their classic boxers are pretty much as they were then, made from 100 per cent cotton and designed for maximum comfort, and there are stretch cotton trunks and briefs for a more active kind of fit. 
The longest standing tenants of Piccadilly Arcade in Mayfair – they were the first shop to move in, back in 1910 – have a quietly regal bearing, and it feels entirely understandable that they've nicknamed their classic cotton shorts design 'the Buckingham Palace boxer'. It's because of their generous, luxe-feeling cut – whether King Sausfingers III wears them himself is, sadly, unknown. But the sense of respect and majesty you'll feel while wearing pants made of the same cotton that Budd makes its shirts from, and put together in the brand's Andover workshop.
Randies is serious about men’s underwear. In fact, the British brand’s goal is to make the best men’s underwear in the world by listening to its customers and adapting its offerings accordingly. Hence, each pair is complete with details designed to improve the everyday experience of wearing undergarments.
The most notable detail integrated into each pair of Randies underwear is the brand’s trademarked Tacklebag feature. Located exactly where you imagine it’s located (c’mon), the pouch swaddles your you-know-what to offer superior support, comfort and prevent sweating and chafing. Now this is technology even commando-goers can get behind.
