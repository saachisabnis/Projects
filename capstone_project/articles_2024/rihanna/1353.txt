How much a celebrity makes on Instagram each year depends on their follower count, perceived clout, business acumen ‚Äî and the number of times they‚Äôre willing to use that #ad tag.
To find out which ones are earning the most in every state in the categories of sport, acting and music, Bored Panda analyzed over 90,000 Instagram posts from 850 celebrities and estimated their annual earnings.

Kevin Hart is America‚Äôs Mr. Sponsored Instagram Post, earning an estimated $28,119,986 last year across 26 ads. The actor-comedian has around 180 million Instagram followers and often uses the platform to promote his own brands, including Gran Coramino tequila, VitaHustle and the Hart House vegan restaurant. In contrast, Mark Wahlberg earned an estimated $15,510,686, despite making 88 sponsored posts ‚Äî Wahlberg has ‚Äòjust‚Äô 29.4 million followers, 16% of Hart‚Äôs follower count. The three Jenner/Kardashians among America‚Äôs top five celebrity Instagram earners have more followers than Hart but post far fewer ads.

A celebrity doesn‚Äôt need to be from a big state to be a big earner ‚Äî but the big showbiz states of California and New York boast Kylie Jenner ($16,816,086) and Jennifer Lopez ($9,130,949) as their top Instagram earners, respectively. These are among 12 states with million-dollar Instagram celebrities. South Carolina also has one of the top earners, in the form of ‚ÄúOuter Banks‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlass Onion‚Äù actor Madelyn Cline. The Goose Creek-born star is a global brand ambassador for Revlon ‚Äî having gotten her big break in a Chuck E. Cheese TV commercial.

Three generations of basketball players make up the three top-earning American athletes on Instagram. LeBron James has 1.76 times as many followers as Steph Curry and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal combined but is second in earnings to Steph Curry, who posts 3¬Ω times as many ads. Golden State Warriors point guard Curry earned an estimated $7,502,807 from Instagram ads last year. NBA players Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson and Chris Paul also made the top ten.

Posting once a fortnight on average ‚Äî 2.5 times the average frequency of the top 10 actors ‚Äî actor-comedian Kevin Hart is the highest-earning American actor on Instagram (see Which American Celebrities Earn The Most Yearly From Instagram, above).
Hart, Mark Wahlberg, and Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson are the big hitters ahead of a long tail of lower (yet still seven-figure) earners. Johnson‚Äôs $9.5 million earnings come from just four sponsored posts, though he also promotes his own brands to his 400 million followers and has reportedly been paid $1 million per post to push his own movies. ‚ÄúMarketing is truly one of my passions ‚Äì especially on a global scale,‚Äù says Johnson.
Meanwhile, Kevin Hart continues to dominate the platform while sparking curiosity about his success, his humor, and even Kevin Hart‚Äôs height, which remains a playful topic among fans and followers.

J-Lo supplements her artistic income with an estimated sum of $9,130,949 annually across just half a dozen ads to her 253.7 million Instagram followers. Sponsored posts include spots for Intimissimi and Virgin Voyages. However, she also uses the platform to promote her own drink and cosmetics lines. With around 85 million fewer followers than J-Lo, Cardi B earned an estimated $6 million with the same number of sponsored posts. Beyonce made just one sponsored ad last year for Verizon at an estimated fee just short of $2 million.
The indivisibility of stars from the products they promote predates the dawn of the sponsored post: Look at Rihanna, who rose to fame through strategic partnerships with brands like Totes and Nike before Instagram was even a thing.
But now that they have an always-on channel of communication with their fans, celebrities don‚Äôt need to sully their artwork with brand allusions ‚Äî they can just slot their sponsors‚Äô goods into their lifestyles. In a culture that‚Äôs increasingly about the hustle, can you blame these millionaires for boosting their income with the occasional seven-figure sponsored post?
We started this study by identifying the most notable and most followed celebrities in each state, resulting in a list of 850 U.S. celebrities across the nation.
To calculate each celebrity‚Äôs estimated yearly earnings, we multiplied their number of disclosed ads in the previous 12 months (April 2023 to March 2024) by the estimated amount each celeb can charge per sponsored post.
This data analysis was completed in April 2024.

 Howdy, I'm Adelaide! I'm originally from Texas, but after graduating from university with an acting degree, I relocated to sunny Los Angeles for a while. I then got a serious bite from the travel bug and found myself moving to Sweden and England before settling in Lithuania about three years ago. I'm passionate about animal welfare, sustainability and eating delicious food. But as you can see, I cover a wide range of topics including drama, internet trends and hilarious memes. I can easily be won over with a Seinfeld reference, vegan pastry or glass of fresh cold brew. And during my free time, I can usually be seen strolling through a park, playing tennis or baking something tasty.

Toxic nature of Instagram fully documented. All of these people suuuuuuuck
Serena Williams is seemingly a good person
Toxic nature of Instagram? Yeah, a lot of those people are asholes, but what about MrBeast? Daniel LaBelle? Stephen Curry, LeBron, Serena Williams, and basically all the other athletes? What about DJ Khaled and Beyonce, what did they do wrong? Steve Harvey is inspiring too. And I don't know much about actors, but I've heard good things about most of them.
Why is the salary of people I've never heard of any of my business? Rude and intrusive. Skipping this thread.
Hardly skipping it if you took the time to realize you don't know these people AND commented on it
She skipped reading it, just took the time to comment and let BP know this is a garbage article. Obviously. üôÑ Didn‚Äôt realize that was a hard concept to wrap your head around, but everyone processes information differently I guess.
I read the title of the thread. Then I commented. Then I came back to read your accusation, when BP notified me of it. Thank you.
It's sad Bobert couldn't even realize that you might not have read the whole thing.
Well, they're apparently so stupid that they think all of those people are paid employees of Instagram, so we can't expect much from them.
What a rude and unnecessary thing to say. This is exactly why I‚Äôm tired of humans üòë
