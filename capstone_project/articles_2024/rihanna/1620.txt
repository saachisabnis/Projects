Charlize Theron is a familiar face to Dior Beauty fans. The actress and activist has had a long partnership with the French fashion house and its beauty offshoot serving as an ambassador for its J'Adore fragrance. (She recently passed the torch to Rihanna.) Now Theron is back to represent Dior Beauty's Capture Totale skin care line.
The line has received a bit of a makeover, including a new name. The anti-aging collection marries pioneering cellular research with the brand's "floral science." It relies on exclusive OX-C Treatment Technology that actually encourages collagen production. The roster contains several serums, such as a wrinkle-correcting treatment boasting the brand's hyaluronic acid duo and a retinol night formula. On the cream front, you're covered from day to night. There's also a pair of eye creams and a set of lotions. Prices start at $65 and go up to $175.
Dior Beauty's revamped Capture Totale skin care line is now available on the brand's website.
