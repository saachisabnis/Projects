Maternity styles have never been sexier, and we love the trend of moms (like Rihanna and Kourtney Kardashian) embracing their beauty while pregnant. Now, it’s Hailey Bieber’s turn, and she is jaw-droppingly gorgeous.

	










	The model, who is currently expecting her first baby with husband Justin Bieber, recently stepped out in a sheer black lace body suit that hugged her growing baby bump. Hailey posted a photo of her outfit on her Instagram story on Saturday, per PEOPLE. In the black-and-white photo, Hailey posed in front of a mirror wearing a fitted black lace body suit accessorized with a black purse, black sunglasses, and sparkly earrings. Her brown hair was up in a messy bun with two loose tendrils framing her face in a ‘90s-chic aesthetic.

	PEOPLE also has a photo of Hailey walking down the streets of New York City, where she added a long black leather trench coat over her outfit. In this picture, you can see the sheer black lace doesn’t do much to cover her skin, as her long legs and baby bump are on full display. She is glowing!



	Last week, the Rhodes founder posed in just a bandana and underwear in a beautiful photo to launch her new blush in a shade called Piggy. “Just cute things 🦋🦋🐷🎀🩷🦋✨” she captioned the stunning photo.

	Of course, Hailey has been embracing her pregnancy era since she announced her pregnancy in May. The announcement video was taken at the couple’s vow renewal ceremony, where Hailey wore a white dress with a flowing long train. They also took photos with the “Beautiful Love” singer posing with his hands around his wife’s bump.

	After years of pregnancy rumors and speculation, Hailey Bieber is embracing her pregnancy in her own terms — and she looks damn good while doing it!  
These celebs have the fiercest pregnancy style, and we can’t stop staring.
