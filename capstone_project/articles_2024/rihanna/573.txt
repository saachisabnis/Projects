Taylor Swift has been named the richest female musician by Forbes as the publication has updated her net worth to a whopping $1.6 billion USD.
Forbes revealed that her net worth has increased to reflect the massive success of her “Eras Tour” and the value of her music catalog following her billionaire status in October 2023. Swift’s earnings include almost $600 million USD from royalties and touring, another $600 million USD from her music catalog and around $125 million USD in real estate.
Swift officially overtakes Rihanna’s top spot of $1.4 billion USD and is now the second richest musician overall, trailing behind JAY-Z’s $2.5 billion USD net worth.
Earlier this April, she ranked No. 14 on Forbes’ richest celebrity billionaires with $1.1 billion USD.
In December 2023, her “Eras Tour” became the first ever billion-dollar grossing tour in history. She was able to hit the billion-dollar mark with 60 shows in a span of eight months and was expected to earn another billion dollars from the tour’s 2024 dates.
