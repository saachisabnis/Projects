Think of a glitzy red carpet event, and the word “bohemian” probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. Elegant? Yes. Groovy? Less expected. But this week, the best dressed stars embraced a more free-spirited approach to evening dressing—choosing looks that were heavy on the sheer, ruffles, and soft neutrals.
Naturally, a Chloé look made the cut; The brand did re-ignited the boho-chic trend earlier this year, after all. In Toronto, Jennifer Lopez wore the label’s nude chiffon ruffled gown, perfectly executing the easy-breezy look. In Venice, meanwhile, jury member Taylor Russell also slipped into a black, sheer ruffled design—hers a little more vampy, and by Schiaparelli.
Billowy and draped shapes also had a moment on the step and repeats. In New York City, Rihanna caused a stir at the Alaïa show when she emerged in a white beaded off-the-shoulder cape gown, wrapped around herself like a fabulous blanket. In Toronto, Daisy Edgar-Jones opted for a sky-blue Gucci gown that was all about the flowing necktie—which blew in the wind for a dramatic delight. The wind? It was a paid actor.
