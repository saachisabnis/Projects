For years, celebrities have taken the opportunity to share political messages through their Met Gala looks.
Some attendees have put direct statements on their garments. For instance, during the 2019 gala, Lena Waithe wore a jacket with embroidered text paying homage to the pioneers of camp: Black queer people. 
In 2021, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wore a white gown with the words “Tax the Rich” on the back, a bold — and controversial — statement at an event known for its wealthy clientele. 
Others have taken more subtle approaches. In 2022, actor Riz Ahmed dressed in homage to immigrant workers whose labor built the Gilded Age.
Throughout awards season this year, various artists, actors and other entertainment professionals have been wearing "Artists 4 Ceasefire" pins with their red carpet looks. As a result, some people anticipate some attendees will use their looks to draw attention to the conflict in Gaza.

Celebrities always showcase their most bold looks at the Met Gala. And their definition of bold always seems to vary.
Take last year, for example, when not one, but two people wore cat costumes on the carpet. Jared Leto and Doja Cat both showed up in feline-inspired attire. wserved as a nod to the gala's celebration of the late designer Karl Lagerfeld, whose cat Choupette was basically a celebrity, also.

Magazine giant Condé Nast, which owns Vogue, reached an eleventh-hour deal with its union, averting a strike on a pivotal night for the media company. 
The union, which represents over 500 employees at Vogue, Vanity Fair and other publications, pledged to do “whatever it takes” ahead of the Gala to make its demands heard. 
The agreement includes a $61,500 starting salary floor, $3.3 million in total wage increases and eight weeks of severance for employees affected by layoffs.

This year’s Met Gala is sponsored in part by TikTok, with CEO Shou Chew serving as an honorary chair. 
Chew is slated to wear something from Ralph Lauren, according to The New York Times. His presence at fashion's biggest night of the year comes at a precarious moment for the company, which faces a potential ban from the U.S. government. President Joe Biden signed a bill last month that presented ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company, with an ultimatum: sell to an approved buyer or be banned in the U.S.

Some extreme costumes and styles rocked by celebrities at the Met Gala can stir an internet frenzy, making the Met Gala a very meme-able event. 
Kim Kardashian’s head-to-toe black Balenciaga attire in 2021 provided meme fodder for many. In 2015, Rihanna’s gold Guo Pei gown, which featured a fur-lined cape with a 16-foot train, also generated commentary online. And of course, last year, when both Jared Leto and Doja Cat showed up dressed as cats, the internet couldn't resist making memes. 
The Met has leaned into its virality in the past. Saint Hoax, an influencer with more than 3.4 million followers on Instagram, made memes live from the event’s red carpet in 2021 using hashtags like #MemetheMet.

Before it became the most glamorous and star-studded night in fashion, the Met Gala started off as a fundraising benefit attended primarily by New York City socialites, according to the Met Museum's website.
The first gala, which cost $50 per ticket, was held in December 1948 to raise money for the Met Costume Institute. It was a midnight dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan.
It wasn’t until decades later that the Met Gala began to resemble the iconic cultural event it is today.

New York City has no shortage of hotels, but The Carlyle or The Mark Hotel are usually the go-to spots for celebrities as they get ready for the Met Gala.
Both hotels are conveniently located on the Upper East Side, within a few blocks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Mark is home to the largest penthouse suite in the U.S. and the unofficial "pre-red carpet," where fans and photographers gather to catch the first glimpses of stars like Kim Kardashian, Gigi Hadid and Anna Wintour on their way to the Met Gala.
"Timing is essential on the day," The Mark's General Manger Etienne Haro said in an interview with PEOPLE. "A celebrity’s journey is monitored so that our transportation coordinators can get the right car in front of the hotel at the right time and ensure the process is flawless."

Kim Kardashian caused an internet frenzy two years ago when she wore Marilyn Monroe’s infamous “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” gown to the 2022 Met Gala.
Originally worn by Monroe to President John F. Kennedy’s birthday fundraiser in 1962, the gown was valued at more than $10 million when Kardashian borrowed it from Ripley’s Believe It or Not! museum. But her choice to wear the historical garment stirred viral backlash when a Monroe historian shared photos online comparing the gown’s condition prior to and after the Gala, causing many online to accuse her of damaging the gown.
In 2021, Kardashian’s head-to-toe black Balenciaga also proved to be meme fodder.

The theme of this year’s Met Gala is “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion," which is also the title of the Costume Institute’s new exhibition. The exhibition celebrates and finds unique ways to display clothing that has been deemed too fragile to be worn again — hence “sleeping beauties.” 
The dress code is “The Garden of Time,” in reference to the beauty of nature and garments. The dress code is derived from a 1962 short story of the same name, written by J.G. Ballard. Vogue has suggested the dress code might evoke many floral and botanical looks on this year’s carpet.
Wintour told TODAY that "the idea of ‘Sleeping Beauties’ is taking these masterpieces from different periods."
"And because so many of them are very fragile, and have to be laid flat, they can’t even be displayed on a mannequin or in any other way," she said. "They are laid flat, behind glass wall and around them are the inspirations that are muses, as (curator Andrew Bolton) calls them."

Taylor Swift, who will embark on the European leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday, is not expected to attend this year’s Met Gala. Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, declined their invitations, according to TMZ. 
Swift last attended in 2016, when she sported a bleach-blonde hairstyle that would go down in infamy as “Bleachella.” 
Kelce, who recently signed a two-year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs, has never attended the Gala. He was spotted at the Kentucky Derby over the weekend.

"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule," she said, sharing that she fears she "unleashed a lot of confusion" about the theme (Sleeping Beauties) and gala dress code (Garden of Time). “We came up with the title ‘Sleeping Beauties.’ It’s wonderful, it’s poetic, its romantic, but actually it could be many, many things."
Wintour said she predicts people will be wearing a lot of flowers on the red carpet. Watch the full interview below.
