Chris Brown kicked off his “11:11” tour with a bang in Detroit, drawing a packed house and proving his point that it’s only the music industry that’s against him. The R&B star took a moment to address the sold-out crowd at Little Caesars Arena on Wednesday night, quipping, “For a n**** they say is blackballed, this don’t look blackballed to me!!!”
The show was a spectacle from start to finish, opening with a Michael Jackson voiceover and featuring Chris Brown soaring over the crowd on wires. The high production value was evident throughout the performance, keeping the audience captivated.
Fans were treated to an extensive setlist divided into four parts, blending his classic hits with new tracks. Not only were those in attendance thrilled, but online reactions also praised Chris Brown for his exceptional showmanship and performance skills.

The conversation around Chris Brown’s career and reputation has been ongoing since his 2009 assault on Rihanna, with controversies continuing to follow him, including a recent incident during the NBA All-Star Weekend involving Ruffles. Despite this, the packed arena in Detroit suggests that his fanbase remains strong and supportive.
