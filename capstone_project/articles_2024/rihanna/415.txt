Kendrick Lamar fans have been given fresh hope that a new album from the Compton superstar is coming soon from TDE affiliate Devin Malik.
Malik, a rapper and producer who has worked with the likes of ScHoolboy Q and Isaiah Rashad, claimed that a new Kendrick project is in the works on Monday (October 7).

Terrace Martin, who has worked extensively with Kendrick over the years, has also teased that a follow-up to Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers is on the way.

He said on Instagram Live earlier this year: “Aye, let me tell y’all the records I’m excited for. I’m excited for YG’s album, I’m excited for Mustard’s album. I’m excited for a lot of people, but there’s two albums. I’m going crazy, I can’t wait ’til they drop.
“Roddy Ricch album and whenever Kendrick drops his album, I’m excited for those two. Those two Compton artists is like, I’m excited. So much shit bubbling, you know?”

Evidence that Kendrick Lamar is plotting a new album is furthered by the fact he is headlining next year’s Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans and is also reportedly planning an arena tour in 2025.
According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Coachella were aiming to secure both Kendrick and Rihanna as headliners for the 2025 edition of the Indio, California festival after struggling to sell out tickets over the last two years.

K. Dot, who has performed at the festival twice, including headlining in 2017, reportedly turned down the slot, instead preferring to focus on his Super Bowl LIX halftime show in February and a subsequent stadium tour.
Kendrick’s last tour, which accompanied the release of his 2022 LP Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, was a huge success.

Dubbed The Big Steppers Tour, the massive international trek at one point became the highest-grossing tour by a rapper in history after earning $110.9 million from 929,000 tickets across 73 shows.
If Kendrick were to drop a new album next year, it would mark his most prolific streak since signing his major label deal in 2012 after releasing several songs throughout 2024, powered by his high-profile beef with Drake.
