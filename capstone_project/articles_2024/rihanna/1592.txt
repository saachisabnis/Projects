Alexandra Daddario attended 2024 San Diego Comic-Con on July 27. During the event, the “Baywatch” star was given the prestigious “Fan Favorite” STARmeter award. The award recognizes her impact on fans and the entertainment industry.
For the occasion, the “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters” actress adorned her feet in a pair of black satin pumps. The sleek style featured a half-satin half-suede appearance. The satin portion of Daddario’s footwear was fixed in the shape of a gathered rosette that offered the silhouette textural and visual interest. Additionally, the style included striking triangular toes and stiletto heels, although the heels were not visible.

Certainly an upgrade from classic black pumps, the actress’ footwear was sophisticated and endlessly versatile, pairing well with her look for the day and any other look she might decide to wear going forward. No matter the style, black footwear can offer the wearer’s look a simplistic base, allowing for further experimentation in other aspects of the ensemble. Similar styles to Daddario’s own can be purchased from the likes of Balenciaga, Valentino, Alexandre Birman and Versace, among a slew of other brands.

Casual and cool, the “Mayfair Witches” star took a page from Rihanna’s pregnancy-style playbook in an elevated pair of baggy pants and a t-shirt. The actress’ ensemble was comprised of an oversized crisp white button-down, along with equally baggy black trousers. Comfort was the name of the game, allowing Daddario to pull a convenient but put-together look with minimal effort. On the accessories front, the thespian wore tear-drop-shaped red earrings. 
When it comes to shoes, Daddario often goes for sharp and sleek pairs. The “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” actress can regularly be seen in neutral or metallic pointed-toe pumps and strappy sandals from Giuseppe Zanotti, Jimmy Choo and Christian Louboutin. Off-duty, she can also be spotted in Allbirds and On Sneakers.
