If you’ve searched for popular sushi restaurants or listened to a fair share of rap music, you’ve probably heard of the name Nobu. With 56 restaurants across five continents, plus 19 hotels (and 20 more under development), Chef Nobuyuki “Nobu” Matsuhisa has become one of the world’s most widely-known and successful restauranteurs. But whether it be a dish at one of his many restaurants or choosing the linens at his hotels, what continuously drives success for Chef Nobu and his brand is a philosophy rooted in simplicity and unrivaled service. Coupled with his humble and warm demeanor, he has garnered a successful portfolio and his renowned status as a celebrity chef.
Practically every celebrity imaginable — Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Drake, Ye, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kim Kardashian — has been to one of Nobu’s establishments. But what keeps everyone returning for 30 years is the brand’s service-focused mindset and elevated food. “The goal is not to cook for myself, but for my guests,” Chef Nobu says.
How has your establishment garnered so much notoriety? Were you ever intentionally catering to celebrity clientele, or did you notice that occurring organically?
The simple answer is that they trust our quality food and they come to enjoy the experience. In my restaurant, the philosophy is good food and service. So the food has to be green, simple and tasty. There’s no key or secret, just chefs making the best meals for the guests.

How has your cuisine evolved over the last 30 years, and where do you think it’ll go in the next 30 years? Is there still room for experimentation?
Most of the signature dishes didn’t start out that way. For example, our squid pasta was created to appease a customer who didn’t eat raw fish and mostly knew pasta. So, I cut the squid into the shape of pasta and added other ingredients to make a pasta dish. I did the same with sashimi by searing it or drizzling hot oil to accommodate customers who were not used to raw fish. The goal is not to cook for myself but for my guests.
How have you continued to innovate with the Nobu brand?
If you look at the Nobu philosophy, the menu has been pretty much the same over the last 30 years. The foundations and traditions are the same, which is why we’re still here. People don’t come to Nobu for innovation, they come for what they know and love.
That said, when we open a new location, we innovate by using local ingredients and vendors. For example, at our new Nassau, Bahamas, location, we have a new style of conch instead of salmon or whitefish, which is a Nobu staple. The innovation comes from simple tweaks and adapting to the location.

How do you translate the food experience to the hospitality offerings?
The hotels pay the same attention to simplicity and service as the restaurants. Instead of eating and going home, the guests’ experience continues throughout the days and nights they stay. It’s a bigger operation, but the hospitality is the same.
As you reflect on 30 years of business, what is the biggest lesson you’ve learned?
I’ve learned about adaptability. Early on, many of my customers did not eat raw fish, but now it’s a mainstay. So that’s something I’ve been able to learn and teach for my customers.
Another has been resilience. Early on, I opened a restaurant in Anchorage, Alaska that burned down 15 days later due to an electrical fire and this was my worst experience ever. But my family and friends supported me through it and I continued.

What advice would you share with a young chef?
I’d say don’t rush. Go step by step. Don’t fret about a mistake and always remember the passion.
What’s your favorite rap lyric about Nobu?
Anything from Drake or Pusha T. I was surprised when one day I was driving and I heard ‘Nobu, Nobu, Nobu,’[from Drake and Future’s song, “Jumpman”] and I said, ‘What is this?’ But I like it because the music also helps bring a younger generation of customers to my restaurant.
