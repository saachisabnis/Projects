Argentine singer Emilia emphasizes reggaeton’s power in promoting gender equality by allowing women to express their sexuality openly. Despite progress, she acknowledges female artists’ ongoing challenges in the music industry.
Emilia shared her thoughts during a press conference in Mexico City while promoting her tour, ‘.mp3’. She highlighted that the fight for women’s rights to discuss their sexuality freely has been a long-standing struggle, and reggaeton provides a platform for this expression.
Emilia pointed out that women in the urban music genre often face higher expectations than their male counterparts. However, she noted that female reggaeton artists typically avoid denigrating their peers or themselves in their lyrics. Instead, they strive to empower women through their music.
“In my songs, I always try to empower women. I feel that we are in a transitional phase and undergoing a process of change,” Emilia said. She acknowledged the difficulties of navigating the public eye, where female artists are frequently compared, criticized, and demeaned. Emilia shared her personal experiences of these challenges, how she channels them into her music as a catharsis, and how she hopes her music can inspire other women in similar situations.
Emilia’s versatility as an artist is evident in her upcoming tour, which promises many surprises inspired by the 2000s and her favorite artists from that era, including Shakira, Thalía, and Paulina Rubio. These influential Latina artists and Anglo artists like Britney Spears, Beyoncé, and Rihanna significantly influenced her album.
“All these powerful Latina women inspired me a lot for this album, as did some Anglo artists I love. They have all been essential to my creative process,” Emilia shared.
Her tour, set to kick off on August 9 and 10 at the Teatro Metropólitan in Mexico City, followed by performances in Querétaro, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Mérida, and León, is highly anticipated. Emilia’s shows are expected to blend nostalgia and modern reggaeton, paying homage to her musical inspirations while showcasing her unique style, creating an exciting experience for her fans.
Emilia’s recent collaboration with the Mexican cumbia band Los Ángeles Azules on the song ‘Perdonarte ¿Para qué?’ has been a career highlight. The song has not only topped the charts on Mexican radio but also reflected its widespread popularity, a testament to Emilia’s growing influence and success in the music industry.
“It was amazing to be part of this cultural crossover. Being considered by such an iconic band was a great honor. I love them!” Emilia expressed enthusiastically.
Looking ahead, Emilia revealed plans to collaborate with an artist from the regional Mexican genre, a style she admires. While she didn’t disclose the artist’s name, she mentioned her interest in working with artists like Carin León, Fuerza Regina, Danna, and Belinda. Emilia also expressed openness to another cumbia collaboration with Los Ángeles Azules.
Beyond her musical talents, Emilia is also a composer, actress, and model. She boasts over 91 million Instagram followers and 16.6 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Her influence extends across various media, highlighting her multifaceted career.
As Emilia continues to break barriers and challenge norms in the music industry, she remains committed to using her platform to promote gender equality. Her journey reflects the evolving landscape of reggaeton and its potential to be a force for social change.
