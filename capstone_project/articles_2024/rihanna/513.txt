Recently, A$AP Rocky shared more about his family life with Rihanna and revealed what drives him crazy about his kids and wife.
Rocky said about the show Cocomelon:  “That s*** is driving me nuts!”
He continued, “Don’t tell my girl I said that.  I’m totally joking.  I don’t give a s***.  She’s tired of it, too, probably.”
He added about Rihanna, “I don’t think there’s a more perfect person because when the schedules are hectic, she’s very understanding of that.  And when the schedule’s freed up, that’s when you get to spend [the] most time together.  It’s all understanding and compatibility.”
