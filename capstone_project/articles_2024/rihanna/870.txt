Today is Giving Tuesday. I asked Yahoo Wellness Editor Erin Donnelly why you should get involved this year. Hint: It’s good for your health!
Erin: Great question! It’s a global movement to spread some good, and a great excuse to support your favorite causes during the holiday hustle and bustle.
Erin: My colleague Kaitlin Reilly recently spoke to experts about this and they told her that being kind can help boost levels of feel-good hormones while reducing stress. It can also help foster community, which can have a lasting impact on your quality of life.
Erin: I’d recommend collecting coats or cans of food for those in need, donating blood or buying a coffee for the school crossing guard you pass on your way to work. Or you could just give money to a charity.
Thinking about donating? Here are some tips to avoid charity scams.
