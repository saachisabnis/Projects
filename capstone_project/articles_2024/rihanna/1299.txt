Rihanna hasn’t released a full-length album in over eight years, though she is starting to think about her original craft again after focusing on other ventures over the past few years.

“I have a lot of visual ideas,” she said. “It’s weird. My brain is working backward right now. I usually have the music first, and the music leads me into all of these visual opportunities, and now I’m having all of these visuals, and I don’t have the songs for them yet, but maybe that’s the key, this time. Maybe the visual ideas are leading me to the songs that I need to make.
“Random ideas, quirky ideas, things that have nothing to do with me at all. I mean, I can’t tell you. The opps is watching.”
Last summer, right before she welcomed her second child with A$AP Rocky, Rih officially stepped down from her role as chief executive officer for her lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. This marked the end of her five-year run in that position, starting from when she founded the company back in 2018.
Former Anthropologie Group CEO Hillary Super has since taken over, while the “Umbrella” hitmaker remains in a leadership position as executive chair.

“It’s been beautiful to see our vision for Savage X Fenty impact the industry at such an incredible magnitude over the last five years,” Rih wrote in a press statement. “This is just the beginning for us, and we’re going to continue to expand in ways that always connect with the consumer.
“I’m so grateful and excited to welcome Hillary Super as our new CEO—she is a strong leader and is focused on taking the business to an even higher level.”
