Singer-songwriter Poppy Ajudha has released her latest single "Ready".
Reflects on Poppy’s personal experience of risking everything for a person you’re in love with. "Ready" was written by Poppy and she also worked on the track’s production with Maestro and Ben Stancombe (Rihanna/J Hus/Tory Lanez).
Speaking on the new release, Poppy says: “Have you ever fallen in love? That feeling when you’re ready to give up everything for someone because you’re so crazy about the idea of them you’re ready to risk it all, ready to fall, ready to wait… an eternity if that’s how long it takes? 
It’s a beautiful thing to feel so deeply, it makes me write songs like this, but when I wrote ‘Ready’ I learnt a big lesson on the importance of who you give your heart to… and how they handle it. Turned out, I was ready for the wrong one.”
 Following her recent sold out shows at House of KOKO in London, on 5 June Poppy will be headlining a show at Colours Hoxton. At the end of last month, Poppy performed "Ready" on BBC Radio 1’s Future Artists live session with Sian Eleri, as well as previous single "My Future", and a cover of Troye Sivan’s "Got Me Started".
"Ready" is out now.
