Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz have been waiting two decades for BeyoncÃ© to drop an album like Cowboy Carter.
Salma shared a series of photos on Instagram Wednesday, featuring shots of the actress wearing a cowboy hat with her Cowboy Carter shirt, as well as set images of her and Cruz from the 2006 movie Bandidas. "Dear @beyonce, PenÃ©lope and I have been waiting 20 YEARS for this album," she wrote in the caption. "FINALLY, it was worth it. ðŸ¤ "
Miley CyrusÂ also took a moment to show her love for BeyoncÃ© by posting several photos and clips proving how big of a fan she has been of the singer. Miley appears on the song "II Most Wanted" off Cowboy Carter.
In one of the videos, Cyrus opens up about performing with "two of the biggest legends and icons," BeyoncÃ© and Rihanna, at the 2008 Stand Up to CancerÂ telethon, revealing they treated her "like a little sister."
Ahead of the release of Cowboy Carter, BeyoncÃ© disclosed that the album came from a place where she felt unwelcomed. The experience led her to explore the history of country music.
"The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me," she wrote. "act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work."
Even though Cowboy Carter contains elements of country music, BeyoncÃ© previously stated she would not classify the album as such. "This ainâ€™t a Country album," she explained. "This is a 'BeyoncÃ©' album."
Following its release, BeyoncÃ© made it a point to show her appreciation for Black female country artists K. Michelle and Mickey Guyton, who opened the door for her.
