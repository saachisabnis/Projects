— This is the weekly script of CNBC's news report for China's CCTV on April 05, 2024.
This week's People of the Week first focuses on Disney CEO, Bob Iger.
After months of contention, the battle for Disney's proxy finally concluded this week. The current management led by CEO Bob Iger and the board of directors emerged victorious with support from the majority of shareholders. Attempts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to join the board ended in failure. Previously, Peltz sought to oust two directors citing reasons such as Disney's underperforming stock price, failed succession plans, and investment missteps. It's reported that Disney spent about $40 million to win this battle, and Iger also leveraged his connections, garnering public support from heavyweight shareholders, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Disney family members, and the widow of Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs.
Although Iger's position is now secure, he and his team still face significant challenges ahead. One key issue is the selection of a successor to the Disney CEO. Previously, due to the company's poor performance, Iger replaced his handpicked successor and returned to Disney. However, Iger's contract is set to expire in 2026. Iger acknowledged this when talking with CNBC that selecting a successor is currently a top priority, and the board of directors will meet more intensively to discuss this matter.

"They established this as their number one priority. They're going to meet even more regularly, going forward because I'm not going to be here forever. It's really important to name the right person at the right time and to create a transition process that is healthy."  
Another person who is also concerned about the issue of succession is Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the French luxury group LVMH.
This week, Forbes released its latest 2024 billionaire rankings, with Arnault becoming the world's richest person for the second consecutive year. Over the past year, his wealth has grown by 10% to reach $233 billion. Arnault is renowned for his strategic acquisitions and leadership skills on his journey to becoming the world's richest person. Currently, LVMH owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. Arnault's wealth growth is primarily attributed to LVMH, which achieved record sales last year. LVMH announced revenues of $94 billion and net profits of $16.5 billion.
In 1997, Arnault first appeared on the billionaire list with a net worth of $3.1 billion. Over the years, he has transformed LVMH into a fashion powerhouse, acquiring iconic brands like Tiffany and collaborating with celebrities like Rihanna. At the age of 75, Arnault places great emphasis on the continuity of his legacy and family control over the LVMH group. This year, he solidified succession plans by nominating his children to join the board of directors. Therefore, the market is closely watching who will become the next leader of LVMH.
Lastly, let's turn our attention to Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank.
This week, the ECB unveiled the minutes of its March monetary policy meeting, indicating expectations of continued inflationary decline in the coming months. Officials are increasingly confident in the prospect of inflation easing. Now, more analysts believe that ECB policymakers, led by Lagarde, have begun preparations for the first rate cut in June.

"We're seeing signs of inflation really starting to come down now. That should open the window for those rate cuts."
A significant concern in the market is how much the ECB will be influenced by the Federal Reserve. Although the ECB insists they won't be influenced by the US and decisions will be based on economic data, some market participants believe that while the ECB may indeed take action on rate cuts ahead of the Fed, ultimately the factors driving Fed decisions will also spill over into Europe. Some analysts also suggest that it could put pressure on the euro if they adopt a more aggressive easing policy, leading to imported inflation from higher import prices. The market is closely watching the ECB's interest rate meeting next week, anticipating detailed explanations from Lagarde regarding when, how fast, and to what extent the ECB will adjust its current tightening policy.
