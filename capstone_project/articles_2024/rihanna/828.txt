Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter is out and about promoting his upcoming film, The Book of Clarence. During the film’s premiere event in Los Angeles, the Brooklynite spoke to Entertainment Tonight about the possibility of hitting the stage for a performance during the Super Bowl. While Carter did not appear interested at first, he did say that he would be open to the idea “maybe one year” in the future.
“Would you ever get on stage again?” the reporter asked.
“Get on stage?” he asked in response.
“At the Super Bowl halftime stage,” the reporter clarified.
“I don’t know. I thought it would be selfish to pick myself too early. Maybe one year. Maybe,” he continued.
Just last year, Jay-Z, Roc Nation, Apple Music and the NFL brought Rihanna to the Super Bowl halftime show stage. Donning an all-red outfit, the chart-topping star performed her greatest hits while teasing the birth of her second child. Nearly a year later, Jay-Z and the crew behind the performance received “Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special” at the 75th Creative Emmy Awards.
This year, Roc Nation, Apple Music and the NFL will bring Usher to the stage at Allegiant Stadium during Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada. Usher gave a taste of what people can expect while performing a medley of his greatest hits at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards. More recently, he has completed a residency at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada.
