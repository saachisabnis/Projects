The new Prime Video show Pop Culture Jeopardy! premieres tonight. I asked Yahoo Entertainment reporter Kelsey Weekman what to expect.
Kelsey: As the host, Colin Jost, says in the first episode, it’s “for people who get upset when regular Jeopardy! players miss clues about rappers and reality TV.” I’m one of those people, and I love the new show.
Kelsey: Jost has been a clue on classic Jeopardy! twice, and he co-hosts “Weekend Update” on SNL. When he was asked about hosting the new show yesterday, he joked, “It’s almost my first real job. … I never exactly thought it would be, but this is the only one that made sense to do.”
Kelsey: The first season will be a 40-game tournament, where teams of three compete to answer questions in new categories ranging from Broadway shows to mixed martial arts to Gen Z.
