Singer Chris Brown flamed the NBA for sending an invitation to play in the 2024 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, only to turn around and uninvite him due to sponsorship pressure.
Breezy accuses the NBA of caving into corporations like Ruffles who he believes continue to punish him for past transgressions. In a series of angry Instagram posts, Brown told his 145 million followers that he continues to suffer for beating Rihanna in 2009, though he doesn’t address the debacle directly.
“I was asked by the NBA to play in the all-star game this year! Only for them to call later and say they couldn’t do IT because of their sponsors like RUFFLES. At this point I’m sick of people bothering me and I’m tired of living in the f—— past,” Brown wrote. 
Brown also produced receipts to show the invitation that was emailed to him:
In a second post, Brown said the NBA tried to mop up the mess by offering him courtside seats. 
 “I POSTED THE EMAILS SO YALL COULD SEE. The NBA still was tryna get me to come and sit court side … NOT F—NG HAPPENING.” 
In subsequent IG posts, Breezy added, “I ONLY GO WHERE IM APPRECIATED.”
Irate fans flooded Ruffles’ website and social media so intensely that the potato chip company responded in an email, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
After being bombarded on their website and social media platforms by angry Breezy fans, Ruffles released an official statement:

Brown immediately responded to the statement, calling Ruffles liars by posting multiple caps which is a colloquialism meaning “lies.”
Some fans concurred with Brown’s sentiments:
