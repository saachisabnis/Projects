Harlem rapper turned fashionista A$AP Rocky is expanding his presence in the clothing world with a new label, American Sabotage. 
Created in collaboration with AWGE, the American Sabotage x AWGE Men’s Spring/Summer 2025 collection debuted at Paris Fashion Week on June 21, with Rihanna attending to support Rocky. 
Get this: the Fenty Hair founder wore a burgundy, fur-lined bomber jacket and studded high heels, capturing photos and videos of the show.
Rocky described the collection as follows: “American Sabotage is more than just a brand–it’s a movement. We’re wrecking boundaries and making statements through every piece, reflecting the spirit and resilience of our communities. This is fashion with purpose, where art meets activism.”
The hot new collection drew inspiration from Rocky’s bold New York style and Harlem’s Dipset. Puma provided footwear, where Rocky has been the Creative Director of their Formula 1 partnership since October 2023, and Ray-Ban provided eyewear. Notable guests included Pharrell, Clipse, and A$AP Nast.
