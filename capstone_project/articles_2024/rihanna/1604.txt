A$AP Rocky and Doja Cat teamed up on a song for the latter’s latest offering, and it has sparked a hilarious discourse in the cyberspace.
On Friday (April 5), the rappers released a new song titled “URRRGE!!!!!!!!!!” as part of Doja’s new project Scarlet 2 CLAUDE, an expanded version of her 2023 album Scarlet. The song’s opening line features the California native rapping: “Fuck them kids/ Ain’t got nice words for none of them kids.”
Soon after the deluxe package went live, a social-media user tweeted a short video of a scandalized Judge Dana Tippin Cutler (of Couples Court With the Cutlers fame) with the caption: “Asap Rocky playing ‘URRRGE!!!’ to Rihanna and the first line she hears is ‘fvck them kids!'”
The “Goldie” hitmaker, who has two children with the Fenty boss, subsequently quoted the post and wrote in good humor: “LMAOO YAH GOTTA CHILL B.”

Contrary to the above quip, Rocky’s parenting skills have in fact proven to be a big plus for Rih. During an interview with Access Hollywood last year, the Bajan singer gushed about her partner and how much their children love him.
“I loved him differently as a dad,” she said. “This is major, major like — it’s a turn on. It’s just like, ‘Wow! What a leader, what a great, patient, loving [dad].”

She added: “And my kids are obsessed with him. I’m just a background, I’m an extra. Yep! It happens! … It doesn’t matter if it’s girls or boys, they love their dad differently and I love to see it.”

In May 2022, the couple welcomed their first child, who they later revealed was named RZA Athelston Mayers after the Wu-Tang Clan founder. For sixth months after becoming parents, the couple refused to publicly reveal his name or face to protect him from press intrusion.
In February 2023, during her performance at Super Bowl LVII, the “Umbrella”hitmaker announced that she was pregnant again. A few months later, the duo welcomed their second son, Riot Rose Mayers.
Late last year, Rocky spoke about potentially collaborating with his significant other on the fashion side of things given they both have deals with Puma.
“If me and my lady was to collab […] team up and just smash and go crazy on?” he said. “I think we do a real great job at collaborating and making children.

“I think that’s our best creation so far. Nothing is better than that out there, any design. I mean, we had a third designer come and help — a ghost designer named God, you know — and shaped everything and we had these beautiful angels. So that’s the best collaboration.”
