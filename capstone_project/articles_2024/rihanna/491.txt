Childish Gambino has addressed a rumor that he was once “friend zoned” by a famous collaborator — and fans seem to think they know who it was.
Speaking to Buzzfeed alongside his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Maya Erskine, the two were taking it in turns to ask each other questions when Erskine asked the rapper and actor: “What is a rumor that you hate that is out that you wanna disprove right now?”

Glover answered: “There was a rumor I got friend zoned by someone once. Someone. But I didn’t get friend zoned by them. The rumor is I got friend zoned by them. I didn’t get friend zoned by them. I got other zoned.”
Many fans thought the person Glover was talking about was singer Jhené Aiko.

One person wrote on X (formerly Twitter): “Donald Glover holding on to Jhene Aiko is understandable,” with the same person adding: “Jhene Aiko is bad as hell. I know Donald Glover deeply sighs when he looks at his wife.”
Another joked: “Jhene Aiko is Donald Glover’s Rihanna,” referencing Drake’s rumored fling with his “Work” collaborator.
Childish Gambino and Jhené Aiko most notably collaborated on the 2013 songs “Pink Toes” and “Bed Peace,” while Glover also directed the singer’s music video for “The Pressure.”
Addressing his relationship with Aiko around that time, Glover said: “I think she’s special. She doesn’t need anyone. Like, that’s the thing. Even if we were together, she wouldn’t really belong to me. She doesn’t belong to anything and I would know that. And that’s the thing, I’ve never had to deal with that…She’s off in her own world.”

Aiko previously denied the two were in a relationship, saying: “We’re friends, we’re good friends. That’s all I’m going to say … We’re still getting to know each other.”
Gambino is currently in a relationship with Michelle White, who he married in 2019 and shares three children with.
