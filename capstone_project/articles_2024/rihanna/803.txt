GloRilla has given “TGIF” a meteorological remix, recruiting weatherman Nick Kosir to help spice up the track.
The duo unveiled the clever version of Glo’s hit single on Friday (July 12).

The “FNF” rapper stopped by Fox 46 in Charlotte, North Carolina and began: “It’s 7 PM Friday, it’s 95 degrees, referencing her track,” before Kosir, who also goes by The Dancing Weatherman, cued up the “TGIF” beat and spat some bars.
He rapped: “I ain’t got no sunburn ‘cus I got sunscreen on me/ I’ma show my forecast for the rest of the week/ How are we gonna cool off? In this kind of heat/ Turn on all the fans/ Turn on the A/C.” Kosir may have a career in the Hip-Hop business if this weatherman gig doesn’t work out.
Kosir isn’t the only person GloRilla has befriended lately.
Lil Wayne and the Memphis star formed an unlikely friendship after bumping into each other at billionaire Michael Rubin’s White Party in the Hamptons.

Despite the star-studded guest list, the Young Money legend gave a special shout out to Glo for being “the only person who came up to me and really hollered at me.”

The “F.N.F.” rapper reciprocated the love on Monday (July 8) by reposting a clip of Wayne’s comments on X (formerly Twitter) while writing: “I luv Wayne [three heart emojis] fav rapper of all time.”
Tunechi, in turn, responded with: “Appreciate ya @GloTheofficial [hang loose emoji].”

GloRilla has long been a fan of Lil Wayne. During an appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast earlier this year, she included the New Orleans native on her Mount Rushmore of rappers.
“I’m only 24 years old, so I can’t say any rappers that were before me because I don’t know their music,” she said, before adding: “So, I’m gonna say Lil Wayne. I think Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers in the world. […] Chief Keef. Drake. Eminem. And JAY-Z.”
