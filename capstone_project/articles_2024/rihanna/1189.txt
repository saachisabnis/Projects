The holiday gathering also promises appearances from yet-to-be-announced “special guests,” according to a press release, which notes that previous surprise performers have included big names such as former TDE titan Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Big Sean, Chris Brown and A$AP Ferg.
The concert and toy drive are being held on December 12. Attendees can gain entry by bringing unwrapped toys, new clothes and shoes and other charitable donations.

The following day will host a “community giveback” day featuring family-friendly activities, a raffle, youth sports programming, barbering services and other festive fun.
Attendees can also take advantage of a jobs fair with organizations who offer employment on site and are committed to creating reentry pathways for ex-offenders.

The two-day event is aimed at giving back to residents of Nickerson Gardens public housing projects, where TDE founder Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith and Jay Rock both grew up.
“Since its inception, TDE has stood as a pillar in the music community but this success is only mirrored by the label’s priotization to give back to some of the most marginalized and under-resourced communities in Los Angeles,” a press release reads.

The powerhouse label is also celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and though its biggest star Kendrick Lamar departed in 2022 to set up his own company in pgLang, things haven’t slowed down.
TDE has been on a hot streak in recent years thanks to a string of standout projects including SZA’s SOS, Doechii’s Alligator Bites Never Heal, ScHoolboy Q’s Blue Lips and Ab-Soul’s Herbert and Soul Burger.

New albums from Isaiah Rashad and Jay Rock have also been teased, as well as a compilation project commemorating 20 years of the “mafia of the West” (which could possibly see the return of Black Hippy).
