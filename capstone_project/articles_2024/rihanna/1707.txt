TeeRoy's 2 Cents:
A$AP Rocky canceled his performance at the iHeartMedia Music Fest only hours before he was scheduled to take the stage. He blamed a sudden illness (quote) “Unfortunately, I ended up getting sick & I won’t be able to perform. I’m sorry to my fans & thankful to iHeart for the opportunity.” (Billboard)
Those fans were shocked when A$AP Rocky joined Rihanna Saturday night at Milan (Italy) Fashion Week. He sat in the front row with Kendall Jenner, and actors Michelle Yeoh and Jacob Elordi. Then partied late into the night. (Elle)
A$AP Rocky must have had a miracle recovery or dipped the Vegas date because he got a better offer.
