Red alert: Rihanna’s newest Fenty x Puma Avanti sneakers have finally dropped — but you’ll want to act fast to secure your size in brand-new red and white colorways. 
The Footwear News cover star teased the “Club Red” Fenty x Puma Avanti L sneakers in July while attending a Manchester City vs. AC Milan soccer game in New York City, alongside a star-studded suite of friends wearing the matching “Warm White” version. The cherry colorway leans into bold red fall 2024 color trends, while the softer white iteration circles back to the same colorway from the spring Fenty x Puma Creeper Phatty Earth Tone collection, offering a more vintage-inspired, lived-in feel to versatile white sneakers. Last February, Rihanna also released the extremely limited Fenty x Puma Avanti Pony shoe, which was adorned with furry calf hair and featured a unique speckled pattern on every pair. Needless to say, every Fenty x Puma drop sells out within the day.

 









The soccer-inspired Avanti L shoe marked the superstar’s return to footwear in September 2023. Despite their original debut in 2001, Puma Avanti shoes are a distinct heritage design, as they blend the retro runner appeal of the brand’s 1978 Easy Rider silhouette and the 1998 Jil Sander King football shoe. Topped with premium leather uppers and grounded in gum rubber soles, the streamlined sneaker is right at home in this year’s footwear trends — and resembles the silhouette of the coveted Puma Speedcat sneaker that has yet to restock for the season.

“Football is a universal language that brings people together from all over the world, all walks of life, and I wanted to pay homage to that,” Rihanna told FN ahead of the Avanti’s debut in black and chrome colorways. The new Avanti collection includes children’s sizing for little kids and toddlers, too. “We had to extend the line to kids so the whole family can be a part of this,” said the superstar.
