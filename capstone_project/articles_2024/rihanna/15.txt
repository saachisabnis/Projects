It was noted that Jay-Z won an Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special award at the 2023 Primetime Creative Arts Emmys. 
The award was given to Jay-Z for co-directing Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show, along with co-direct Hamish Hamilton. Jay-Z beat out the likes of Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes, Paul Miller’s special on Carol Burnett, and more. 
This isn’t the first time Jay-Z has been issued an Emmy award for his work, as he won an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special after helping put together Dr. Dre’s Super Bowl Halftime performance. The show featured appearances from Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Paak, and Eminem.
