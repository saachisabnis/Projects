Update: Just a few weeks ago, Salehe Bembury teased a new partnership between him and PUMA. Now, the brand has announced that Bembury will be helping shape the next generation of PUMA Hoops. Not only will he create a signature shoe for the brand, but he will aid in the recruitment process as PUMA looks to add another athlete to its current Hoops roster of LaMelo Ball, Scoot Henderson, Flau’Jae Johnson and Breanna Stewart. While Bembury has worked with many different footwear brands, this marks his debut with PUMA . The provided press release notes  that Bembury will “create a new look and feel within basketball itself,” which, while vague, indicates that his design language may influence the Hoops line as a whole, perhaps in a way that is similar to Jerry Lorenzo’s recent involvement with adidas Basketball.
“My designs are a platform for storytelling and cultivating community; an opportunity to breathe new meaning into a product. While my work has been known to cater to the
outdoor space, a space I recently developed an intimate relationship with, my partnership with PUMA Hoops will allow me to tell a more deeply rooted personal story,” shares Bembury. “As a ’90s kid from New York City, I’ve played basketball my whole life and have a deep history, emotion and nostalgia for the sport. I’m excited to leverage this collaboration as a catalyst to introduce an untold side of me and engage a new community.”
Stay tuned for updates as we eagerly await news of which athlete the duo signs, as well as first looks at Bembury’s work with PUMA.

Original Story: It looks like Salehe Bembury is cooking something up with PUMA.
In a recent Instagram post, the footwear designer takes a photo on the tarmac to his private jet with what appears to be a sign that reads in all caps, “TOP SECRET PUMA IDEAS.” Teasing an upcoming project and potentially a collaboration with the athletic lifestyle brand, the designer creates buzz as fans begin to speculate what is next. Taking to his Instagram Stories at the time of writing, Bembury answered a few fans’ questions, specifically those who were concerned with his standing relationship with New Balance.
When asked if there would be more to come with New Balance shoes, Bembury simply responded, “Much more” to come. Another fan asked, “How can you work with multiple brands at the same time without issues,” to which he replied, “Sturdy contracts and sound communication.” So far, fans are left in the dark as to what the next collaboration could be. Other big names that have partnered with PUMA include Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. Stay tuned for more information.
