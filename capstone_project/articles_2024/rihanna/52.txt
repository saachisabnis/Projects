(Gray News) – Taylor Swift has just landed her 12th No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Fortnight,” Billboard announced Monday.
The song, featuring Post Malone, also became Spotify’s most-streamed song in a single day when it was released April 19.
“Fortnight” is the lead single off Swift’s newest album “The Tortured Poets Department,” which has already shattered streaming records itself, including becoming the most-streamed album in a single day.
“Fortnight” joins these other Swift songs that hit No. 1:
Swift is only the eighth artist in history to have 12 or more No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, joining the ranks of artists like The Beatles and Michael Jackson.
The only artists in history to achieve such a feat are:
“Fortnight” hitting No. 1 pushed Swift past Whitney Houston, who has 11 No. 1 hits.
This week, Swift also landed her 14th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with “The Tortured Poets Department,” tying her with Jay-Z. To date, only The Beatles have more, with 19.
Perhaps most impressively, Swift also swept the entire top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 – in fact, it was the top 14. She became the only artist in history to accomplish this feat when she released “Midnights” in 2022, and now, she’s done it a second time.
Swift is on a short break from touring right now but will begin the next leg of the Eras Tour in Paris on May 9.
Billboard has a running list of every record Swift has made on its charts.
