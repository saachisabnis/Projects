	In a series of since-deleted X posts, singer M.I.A. subtly called out JAY-Z and Roc Nation for not assisting her in getting her child back in an ongoing custody battle. 

	As Hov most likely doesn’t have that kind of pull with the courts, the “Paper Planes” artist took her frustrations out on X in all caps. She began her rant by blaming Joe Biden for holding up her visa application to come to the US, and then pointed her fingers at Roc Nation, which once managed her.

	On Thursday (Feb. 8), she wrote, “THE DAY I WAS SERVED, 4 MY CHILD , [ROC] NATION STOPPED ALL COMMUNICATION WITH ME AND ALL MY EMAILS TO JAYZ ASKING FOR HELP WAS WIPED FROM MY INBOX. MY WAS BROKEN INTO AND EVERY LAP WAS TAKEN. I WAS TRAPPED IN BROOKLYN ON ORDER SERVED THAT [RESTRICTED] ME LEAVING BKLYN FOR 15 YEARS”

	










	“I SACRIFICED MY CAREER FOR MY CHILD. THEY RIPPED ME OFF AND COPIED MY STYLE AND GAVE IT TO THEIR PUPPETS AND SHADOW BANNED ME ON EVERY PLATFORM,” she continued, seemingly taking shots at Rihanna and others who came after her to the label. “BUT IT WAS WORTH IT TO SAVE HIM FROM THE MADNESS OF WHAT YOU KNOW NOW.”

	She also made claims that the U.S. has denied her Visa application to return because she’s spoken out against genocide. 

	“I HAVE SHOWN SUPPORT FOR JULIEN FOR 14 YEARS AND HAVE BEEN TO THE USA MANY TIMES,” she wrote. “THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT THIS TIME IS, I CALLED FOR A CEASE FIRE AND SPOKE OUT AGAINST GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING. NOW I AM FORCED TO PICK BETWEEN MY CHILD AND SPEAKING UP FOR WHATS RIGHT BY GOD.

	Truly all over the place, the singer then made a claim that JAY-Z was paid off by the founder of the sex cult, NXIVM and that Beyoncé and Solange were allegedly friends with her son’s caretaker, who she says vaccinated him without permission.
