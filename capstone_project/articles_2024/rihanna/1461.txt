Eminem has become a household name in the music world.
Born Marshall Mathers, the rapper may be known by multiple monikers in the music industry — he goes by Slim Shady as well — but he’ll always be Eminem. The musician got his start as a member of various hip-hop groups, including D12, before taking the solo music route.
By 1995, Eminem had a record deal and released his debut album, Infinite, the following year. However, his rise to fame came once he released The Slim Shady LP in 1999.
