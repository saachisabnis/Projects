MUMBAI, India: Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, Asia's richest man, married Radhika Merchant in an opulent ceremony that many have called the wedding of the year. 
The celebration, filled with global celebrities, business magnates, and politicians, occurred at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai and the family home.
The wedding rituals began on July 12 and continued past midnight, culminating in a grand reception, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended on July 13 evening. Modi's attendance underscored the Ambani family's significant influence and connections.
Anant Ambani, 29, oversees Reliance Industries' renewable and green energy division, while Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the marketing director for her father's pharmaceutical company, Encore Healthcare. The couple's union marked the end of months-long pre-wedding festivities, including performances by Rihanna, Justin Bieber, and other international stars.
The four-day celebration began with traditional Hindu wedding rituals and featured a guest list that included former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, and celebrities like Kim Kardashian and John Cena. Guests wore traditional South Asian attire by major Indian fashion designers.
Bollywood icons such as Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Salman Khan attended the wedding and danced to popular Hindi movie songs. Indian cricket legends, including Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, were also present.
The extravagance of the wedding has drawn criticism amidst rising inequality in India, where many struggle with economic challenges. Traffic diversions were implemented to manage the influx of guests, exacerbating daily inconveniences for Mumbai residents.
Mukesh Ambani, the groom's father, has a net worth of US$116 billion, making him the world's ninth-richest person. His conglomerate, Reliance Industries, spans various sectors, including petrochemicals, telecoms, and retail, with an annual revenue exceeding $100 billion.
The pre-wedding celebrations set a new standard for opulence. In March, the Ambanis hosted a three-day prenuptial bash for Anant, attended by 1,200 guests, including global tech billionaires and Bollywood megastars. The family also organized a mass wedding for over 50 underprivileged couples, showcasing a mix of grandeur and philanthropy.
The Ambani family's wealth and influence were highlighted in 2018 when Beyonce performed at pre-wedding festivities for Mukesh Ambani's daughter.
