As a mom of two young Black sons, singer-entrepreneur Rihanna knows the stakes are too damn high in this 2024 election to sit back and do nothing. So the “Don’t Stop The Music” artist went straight to social media to call on her 150 million Instagram followers to get out and vote. 
On November 4, RiRi posted a video of herself staring out of a car window with the sticker, “POV: Me trying to sneak into the polls with my son’s passport. #votecauseicant.”
Although the singer, born in Barbados, came to the United States to launch her career as a teen, she never changed her citizenship. As a result, she is not eligible to vote in U.S. elections. 
But that didn’t stop her from joking about trying to devise a plan to make her voice heard with the help of her sons RZA, 2, and Riot, 1, whom she shares with her partner A$AP Rocky. 
“When protecting p*ies and firing p*ies can happen all in one vote #votecauseicant #TanSuitSeason,” Rihanna captioned her post, emphasizing the importance of protecting women’s reproductive rights as one of the biggest reasons to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign.
The comment section was flooded with messages of support from fans, including actress Tracee Ellis Ross, who dropped a series of hearts. 
“I voted for us sis 🗳️,” wrote another fan in the comments.
Rihanna’s beauty and fashion brands even chimed in, putting an exclamation point on Rihanna’s call to action. 
“YA’LL HEARD MOTHER 💃🏽🗳️🖤,” commented FENTY Beauty,” “she said VOTE,” said Savage X Fenty and “WE HEADIN’ TO THE POLLING STATIONS 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🗳️,” wrote FENTY Hair. 
Rihanna may not be able to cast her vote in the 2024 election, but Harris has secured lots of support from high-profile celebrities who have appeared with her on the campaign trail, including Megan Thee Stallion, Kelly Rowland, Barack and Michelle Obama; Cedric The Entertainer and Beyoncé.
