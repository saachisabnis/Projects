I’m not joking when I say that nothing has put me in more of the holiday spirit than this video of Mariah Carey signing Rihanna’s boob at a Christmas concert in Brooklyn. This is truly the reason for the season.
At Barclays Center on December 17, Carey was performing the last show of her Christmas Time Tour to a crowd that included Rihanna standing in the front row alongside her friend Jason Lee. A video from the event posted to Lee’s Instagram shows RiRi and Lee excitedly watching Carey walk down from the stage, and discussing asking her for an autograph. “Should I ask her to sign my shirt or my titty?” Rihanna asked Lee, as if that was even a question.

Carey immediately approached her fellow singer as soon as she spotted her, and Rihanna presented her left boob for the Queen of Christmas to sign. “I need a signature,” Rihanna said, and began asking for a Sharpie. As soon as Mariah Carey began signing her name on Rihanna’s breast, Ri grabbed the microphone and announced to the crowd, “Mariah Carey is signing my tit, y’all.” She also called the moment “iconic.” Hard agree.
The two divas finished the moment with an “I love you” and a hug, and this was all I wanted for Christmas, actually.
