Rihanna has now accomplished what no other female artist ever has.
On May 31, it was announced the billionaire entrepreneur and international popstar has now landed more RIAA-certified diamond singles and diamond-certified titles than any other female artist ever.
Her reaction, sent to her nearly 108 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, was simple.
“Ain’t no back ‘n forth,” she posted.
The diamond singles are “Needed Me,” “Umbrella,” “Stay,” “Diamonds” and “We Found Love,” which features Calvin Harris.
The superstar has not released an album in over eight years, when she released Anti in January 2016. Since Anti, Rihanna shifted her attention to Fenty, her beauty and fashion brand. While she is one of music’s biggest stars with a wildly-successful career, it is her Fenty brand that made her a billionaire in 2021.
Her financial success is something Jay-Z, the man who signed her, brags about in DJ Khaled’s “God Did.”
“How many billionaires can come from Hov crib,” he rapped. “I count three. Me, Ye and Rih/Bron’s a Roc boy, so four, technically.”
Kanye West, another former Jay-Z signee, became a billionaire from his Yeezy brand and LeBron James became a billionaire in large part thanks to his SpringHill Company, which is all about production.
Another reason Rihanna may not be as active in music lately is because she has become a mother to two children with rapper A$AP Rocky. The 36-year-old also holds the title as the youngest solo artist to get 14 No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.
