William Hill have named Drake in their list of potential artists who could make an appearance in Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show. Lamar has been confirmed as next year’s halftime entertainment, and at 16/1 Canadian Drake trails a host of American rappers in the market following the pair’s recent feud.
Jay Rock and Baby Keem head the betting at 6/5 apiece, with huge names such as Lil Wayne and Travis Scott (both 6/4) fancied as well. The return of Oasis sees them enter calculations as the 50/1 rank outsiders to kick off their 2025 tour with a Super Bowl appearance.
Spokesperson for William Hill, Lee Phelps:
“Kendrick Lamar has been confirmed for next year’s Super Bowl halftime show and his arch-nemesis Drake is among a host of names who could be set to join the American rapper during his set. We make Drake a 16/1 chance to appear alongside Lamar, whilst other stars of the music industry in Lil Wayne (6/4), Travis Scott (6/4), Rihanna (7/1) and Eminem (8/1) are all well fancied.
“Oasis haven’t announced any dates outside of Great Britain and Ireland, and we don’t expect them to be rocking up to the half-time show at 50/1, but you can never say never with the Gallagher brothers!”
