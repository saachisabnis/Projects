A$AP Rocky has finally addressed his beef with Drake, and asserts that there is no real issue there. 

	During an interview with Billboard Magazine, the Harlemite opened up about what was happening with him during the Great Rap War of 2024, better known as the Drake-Kendrick Lamar feud.

	Despite all the rah-rah building around a potential showdown between Drizzy and himself, Rocky told the zine that the “pu**y boy” ain’t even on his radar right now. The fashion designer declared the back and forth as nothing serious, and wouldn’t even categorize it as “real beef.”

	“You got to realize, certain n**as was throwing shots for years. I ain’t in the middle of that sh*t. That’s not how I retaliate right now. I got bigger fish to fry than some p***y boys,” Rocky asserted.

	










	“It is real beef outside. It is real. N**as getting really clipped and blitzed every day. N**as sniping n**as every day. That little kitty sh*t ain’t about nothing.”

	Right before Drake v. Kendrick took off, Drake took shots at Rocky on a couple For All the Dogs cuts, including “Fear of Heights” and “Another Late Night.” The latter found him dissing Rocky, saying, “I ain’t Pretty Flacko, bi**h, this sh*t get really Rocky/ Damn, what? Dirty how I did him in the Wraith.” 

	“Fear of Heights” had some words for Rocky’s partner, Rihanna, where Drake spit, “Why they make it sound like I’m still hung up on you?/ That could never be/ Gyal can’t ruin me/ Better him than me, better it’s not me/I’m anti, I’m anti/ Yeah, and the sex was average with you/ Yeah, I’m anti ’cause I had it with you/ Okay, I’m auntie like your daddy sister/ Auntie like a family picture/ And I had way badder bi**hes than you, TBH/ Yeah, that man, he still with you, he can’t leave you/Y’all go on vacation, I bet it’s Antilles.”

	A$AP would follow up with his shots on Kid Cudi‘s “WOW” and then on Metro Boomin and Future‘s “Show of Hands.” Rocky defended his girl’s honor and dragged Drake’s baby mother, Sophie Brussaux, into the fray. “Ni**as swear they bi**h the baddest, I just bagged the worst one/Ni**as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin’?/I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son/Still don’ trust you, it’s always us, never them/Heard you dropped your latest sh*t/Funny how it just came and went,” Rocky raps. 

	Drake would fire back on “Family Matters,” where he was more direct with his vitriol, calling out the NY artist by name. He declared that nobody is checking for Rocky’s music and that people are only interested in him due to fashion and his relationship with Riri. 

	










	It’s rumored that A$AP will deliver yet another diss aimed at the Canadian crooner on his forthcoming project, Don’t Be Dumb. But only time will tell.
