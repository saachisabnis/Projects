Following the announcement that Rihanna is to be the new face of Dior J’Adore, the French luxury house has revealed the first look at the new campaign featuring RihRih herself. Lensed by long-time friend of the house Steven Klein, the imagery reveals Rihanna as the new muse for J’Adore. 
Ahead of a new campaign video featuring Rihanna, the house is giving the Barbadian singer the spotlight. As the first new face of J’Adore in 20 years, the campaign solidifies Rihanna’s place in the contemporary luxury fashion. An icon in beauty and fashion, the pop idol joins forces with the legendary perfume and is pictured amongst the golden hues of Versailles. Radiant in a golden gown embroidered with pale sequins and a reinvented necklace, both by Maria Grazia Chiuri, Rihanna is devoted in self-expression, celebrating her J’Adore moment. 
As the roll out for the campaign continues, Dior and Steven Klein are slated to drop a new campaign video with Rihanna in the early fall. Rihanna rings in a new J’Adore era in fashion, beginning a new golden dream for the ages. Look out for the campaign video coming soon.
