(ThyBlackMan.com) GloRilla, the Memphis rap sensation, has had a whirlwind of a year in 2024, and her name is on everyone’s lips. She’s not only making waves with her infectious hits but also drawing comparisons to one of the biggest names in the industry—Rihanna. Recently, the rapper spoke to Billboard, where she mentioned that fans have been calling her and Rihanna “twins,” and it’s easy to see why. From their bold and unapologetic style to their ability to command attention in any room, it’s no wonder people are starting to see the resemblance.
But GloRilla isn’t just settling for comparisons. She’s carving out her own lane, and many are beginning to see her as the next big thing in rap. With her debut album GLORIOUS set to drop soon, GloRilla is ready to follow in the footsteps of past rap greats like Lil Kim, Nicki Minaj, and Queen Latifah, who have all transcended the genre to become icons. As the “It Girl” of rap, she’s poised to not only match the heights of these legends but potentially surpass them.
When GloRilla burst onto the scene, her infectious energy and catchy beats captivated audiences worldwide. Her rise has been swift, and she’s proven that she’s more than just a one-hit wonder. From her breakout hit “F.N.F (Let’s Go)” to her latest anthem “TGIF,” she’s shown versatility and charisma that have fans chanting her name. GloRilla’s approach to rap is reminiscent of the raw and fearless energy that icons like Lil Kim and Nicki Minaj brought to the table. It’s no surprise that fans are starting to see her as the heir apparent to these legendary rap queens.
Comparing GloRilla to past greats is inevitable. Like Lil Kim, she embraces her bold style, unafraid to express herself and push boundaries. Her fashion choices and dynamic persona make her a force to be reckoned with, just as Lil Kim dominated the rap scene with her larger-than-life personality. GloRilla’s ability to rap about her life experiences, her authenticity, and her vulnerability resonate with her fans, much like Nicki Minaj’s storytelling prowess. The fact that she’s managed to garner such a massive following in such a short period of time speaks volumes about her star power.
Queen Latifah paved the way for female rappers to be seen not only as musicians but as multifaceted artists and businesswomen. GloRilla seems to be taking notes from the Queen’s playbook, positioning herself not just as a rapper but as a brand. From her collaborations to her fashion endeavors, it’s clear that she has her eyes set on longevity in the industry. She’s the kind of artist who’s not content with just topping the charts—she’s ready to take over the world.
When fans began comparing GloRilla to Rihanna, it wasn’t just about their looks. There’s something about their energy, their aura, that connects them. Rihanna is a global icon who has successfully dominated not only music but also fashion and business, making her one of the most influential figures of our generation. For GloRilla, being compared to such a powerhouse is not only a compliment but a potential gateway to greatness.
In her Billboard interview, GloRilla shared that Rihanna herself had shown support for her music, especially her song “TGIF.” When RiRi was seen dancing to the track, it was a huge moment for GloRilla. “RiRi [doesn’t normally dance] to people’s songs. When she did that, I was like, ‘Wow,’ ’cause you know, people be saying that that’s my twin. They be hatin’ on me. I love Rihanna. I’m a big fan of Rihanna,” she said. The admiration is mutual, and there’s a genuine connection forming between the two artists.
It’s not just about the music; it’s about the sisterhood. GloRilla and Rihanna have the potential to create a beautiful dynamic that could inspire generations of young women. Imagine a collaboration between these two—it would be more than just a song; it would be a cultural moment. Rihanna has a history of championing other female artists, and GloRilla could be the next in line to receive that boost. It’s not hard to envision these two joining forces for a powerful track that would take over the charts and further cement GloRilla’s place as a superstar.
GloRilla’s connection to Rihanna isn’t the only star-studded relationship she’s building. In 2024 alone, she’s already linked up with some of the biggest names in the industry. From Beyoncé to T-Pain, her collaborations are setting her up for a legendary career. Meeting Beyoncé multiple times has been a dream come true for GloRilla. She gushed in her interview, saying, “I’m the biggest fan of Beyoncé. This was my third time meeting her, and she’s always so sweet every time. I love her.”
Her ability to attract and collaborate with industry heavyweights shows just how much respect she’s garnered in such a short amount of time. It’s not just about the music—it’s about being part of a legacy, and GloRilla understands that. With her album GLORIOUS featuring contributions from artists like Latto, Sexyy Red, and Muni Long, she’s proving that she has the ability to pull together a lineup that showcases her influence and reach.
One of the standout tracks from her upcoming album, “I LUV HER,” features the legendary T-Pain. GloRilla expressed her excitement, noting how refreshing it was to hear his voice again. “He was the GOAT of his time. He’s still the GOAT. He’s somebody whose music will never get old,” she said. Collaborating with icons like T-Pain is just another step in her journey to superstardom.
What sets GloRilla apart from her peers is her authenticity. She’s not trying to fit into a mold or copy anyone’s style—she’s unapologetically herself. This authenticity is what draws fans to her and why she’s gaining recognition from some of the most influential figures in music. Rihanna’s endorsement and her multiple encounters with Beyoncé are proof that the industry is paying attention.
When Rihanna co-signed “TGIF” and danced to the track, it wasn’t just a moment for GloRilla—it was a moment for all female rappers. It’s a reminder that when one succeeds, it opens doors for others. GloRilla’s rise is about more than just her; it’s about uplifting an entire community of women who have often been overlooked in hip hop.
The comparisons to Rihanna are a compliment, but GloRilla is determined to build her own legacy. She’s aware of the expectations and the pressure that comes with being the “It Girl” in rap, but she’s embracing it with grace. Her focus is on staying true to herself and her craft, and with the support of artists like Rihanna, she’s well on her way to becoming a global superstar.
As news of GloRilla and Rihanna’s budding sisterhood spreads, fans have been quick to weigh in. Some have taken to social media, excitedly pointing out the similarities between the two, while others are skeptical. “GloRilla and Rihanna look nothing alike! But their vibes are unmatched, though,” one fan tweeted. Another fan wrote, “GloRilla really the new wave! Seeing her and Rihanna collab would be the collab of the century!”
The possibility of a collaboration has sparked debates online, with many fans expressing their hopes for a joint track. Some have even started speculating about what a music video featuring the two would look like, imagining a visually stunning production that combines GloRilla’s Memphis grit with Rihanna’s Caribbean flair. It’s clear that fans are hungry for more from GloRilla, and they want to see her continue to rise alongside some of the biggest names in music.
GloRilla’s response to the comparisons and support from Rihanna has been nothing short of humble and appreciative. She knows the weight of being compared to such an iconic figure, but she’s also aware of the opportunities it presents. A GloRilla and Rihanna collaboration isn’t just wishful thinking—it’s a realistic possibility that could very well take the music industry by storm.
As GloRilla continues to rise, it’s becoming clear that she’s not just a flash in the pan. With her debut album GLORIOUS on the horizon and a growing list of iconic supporters, she’s well on her way to superstardom. Her ability to connect with other industry giants like Rihanna and Beyoncé demonstrates her staying power and influence. The sisterhood she’s forming with Rihanna is a beautiful thing to witness, and it’s only a matter of time before these two powerhouses come together for a collaboration that will shake the music world.
GloRilla’s journey is a reminder that the future of hip hop is in good hands. With her talent, authenticity, and unwavering determination, she’s set to become the next legend in rap, following in the footsteps of greats like Lil Kim, Nicki Minaj, and Queen Latifah. Fans are watching closely, and if the past year is any indication, GloRilla’s star is only going to shine brighter.
