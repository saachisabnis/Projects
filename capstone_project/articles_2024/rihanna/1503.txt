Filling up trunks with holiday joy, fun and food for hundreds of families, Center Table Winter Harvest — presented by The Mark Cuban Foundation, The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, The Heroes Foundation and the North Texas Food Bank — will take place Wednesday, Dec. 18, from 9-11 a.m. at the Mark Cuban Heroes Basketball Center (1800 Bonnie View Rd., Dallas, TX 75216). In its fifth year, the free drive-up holiday extravaganza will provide food boxes for up to 500 families who reside in the Cedar Crest and South Dallas neighborhoods (75215 and 75216 zip codes).
Music director, producer and pianist Erskine Hawkins III – a University of North Texas graduate who has worked with a slew of stars from Disney’s Zendaya to Eminem and Rihanna – will perform throughout the morning. Hawkins is also a keyboardist/organist of the Potter’s House Church under the direction of Bishop T.D Jakes.
Other festivities will include Santa and Mrs. Claus, stilt walkers, roller-skaters decked out in holiday costumes, music and entertainment provided by DJ Spice and more. 
Food boxes will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. A photo ID must be presented upon arrival. Pre-registration is not required.
Center Table launched in May 2020 to address the tough times many families have faced since the onset of the pandemic. Since then, Center Table events have provided nearly 34,000 meals and more than two million pounds of food to families and households.
