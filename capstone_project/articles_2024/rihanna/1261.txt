Leave it to Rihanna‘s designer crocs to make even a casual errand run into a noteworthy style moment. The singer was spotted in Beverly Hills on Saturday, December 14, 2024, wearing what might be one of her most relatable—yet still distinctly Rihanna—outfits to date.

The centerpiece of her shopping ensemble was, you guessed it, a pair of crocs. But these Simone Rocha x Crocs Embellished Stomp Clogs, retailing at $200, aren’t your standard rubber clogs—they’re decorated with faux pearls and gem embellishments, striking a balance between comfort and that signature Rihanna flair.

For her outing with partner A$AP Rocky, Rihanna paired the designer Crocs with a practical Martine Rose Track Jacket and Gucci ribbed-knit wool shorts. True to form, she added an unexpected layer: a vintage Valentino Alixandre Furs floor-length coat—the same one she recently paired with $6 boxers in November 2024, because why not?

Rocky himself kept things equally relaxed for their shopping trip, wearing black sweats with Puma sneakers and white ruffled socks—proving that even their errand-running style has a coordinated edge. 
In an April 2024 conversation with Mel Ottenberg for Interview magazine, Rihanna opened up about their similar taste in style. “We saw fashion the same. We saw creative the same. We ended up in the same circles a lot,” she explained. “And past that, when we grew up, we ended up supporting each other’s brands and products and creative all the time. I would wear his shit, he would show up to my launches.”
Their relationship, which turned romantic at “the end of 2019,” was built on years of friendship and mutual understanding. “We’ve known each other for a long time,” Rihanna shared in the interview. “I’ve seen him in relationships. He’s seen me in relationships. We’ve seen each other outside of relationships. We knew what we’re capable of, and the trouble that we could bring to each other’s lives. We can make or break each other’s hearts. And so, we started dating with a lot of caution.”
That caution has clearly paid off. The couple welcomed their first son, RZA, in May 2022, followed by their second son, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their coordinated style has only strengthened since becoming parents—for this shopping trip, Rocky knew exactly how to complement Rihanna’s high-low mix.

 









The Fenty Beauty founder has been on quite a style streak lately, from styling nothing but lingerie to the whimsical turquoise fur hat she donned at the Fashion Awards in London this month. But there’s something particularly charming about this errand-running ensemble that combines luxury pieces with practical comfort—even if that comfort comes in the form of $200 Crocs.
Is this the moment that finally convinces us to invest in designer Crocs? Maybe. At the very least, it’s a reminder that sometimes the best outfits are just about throwing on what feels right—even if that happens to include pearl-embellished clogs and a cozy fur coat.
