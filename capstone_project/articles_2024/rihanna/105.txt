This year’s CinemaCon provided plenty of announcements and first looks. Audiences got to see a glimpse of Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal duking it out in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator sequel, Ryan Reynolds dropping a flurry of F-bombs as Deadpool and Rihanna delaying her music career to follow her passion: playing Smurfette in a new Smurfs movie. But the best news from the con came for fans of Wicked, which is next in line for the musical-to-movie treatment: Peter Dinklage was announced as the voice of the beloved Dr. Dillamond. That left the timeline particularly euphoric as it meant that “the Wicked movies were marked safe from James Corden.” 
America’s least favorite Brit wasn’t the only one being ridiculed online this week, though. Other burn victims included a miniature Larry David, an employer that should look a little closer and some dinosaur chicken nuggets that relived their ancestors’ trauma.
