Rihanna’s influence on fashion never falters, and her latest release with PUMA is a perfect blend of family pride, personal flair, and soccer nostalgia. Nearly a year after reviving the Fenty x PUMA Creeper, she’s back with two fresh colorways of the Fenty x PUMA Avanti, reimagined in “Club Red” and “Warm White.” This drop not only channels the retro charm of soccer-inspired footwear but also reflects Rihanna’s evolving life as a “soccer mom” in the making—a theme she embraces wholeheartedly as her sons RZA and Riot grow older.
The Avanti’s release was celebrated with a family-centered twist: a press conference where kid social media influencers took the lead on questions. This informal Q&A underscored Rihanna’s dedication to infusing her family values into her designs. Although her sons and partner Rocky haven’t officially added their creative input just yet, they’re undeniably a source of inspiration in her sneaker evolution.
When it came to color selection, Rihanna admits she kept it “selfish,” choosing shades she personally loves and envisions her kids rocking as they grow. The “Club Red” sneaker serves as her go-to for any outfit, a hue she says looks good beat up or fresh out of the box. Meanwhile, “Warm White” brings a toned-down, versatile vibe that offers a break from her usual style. With gold accents and premium leather, each pair embodies her commitment to creating high-quality, adaptable pieces that don’t sacrifice style for sentimentality.
The journey of the Avanti itself is something that spoke to Rihanna. As a fan of classic soccer stars like Eusebio, Pelé, and Maradona, she saw this archival silhouette as a nod to PUMA’s sports legacy. “When I first met the Avanti, there was so much history behind the shoe. That’s what I was drawn to,” she shared, revealing her fascination with PUMA’s archive and her desire to give these iconic designs a contemporary edge. She wanted a sneaker that was chunky yet sleek—something that feels nostalgic yet open to modern reinterpretations. And with each colorway, Rihanna taps into a different era of her own career. “The red ones would definitely be the Loud album and the white ones would be Music of the Sun,” she says, evoking memories of her early music days, when her style was as pure and fresh as her career was new.
And what does it mean to be a “cool mom” in Rihanna’s world? In her words, “You’re looking at it.” As she steps fully into her roles as a mother, artist, and designer, she’s showing the world that parenthood can be as stylish and as impactful as any other chapter of life.
For those wanting to add a bit of Rihanna’s family-centered creativity to their sneaker lineup, the new Fenty x PUMA Avanti sneakers are available now at PUMA’s official store. Don’t miss the chance to snag a pair and add a touch of Riri’s iconic flair to your wardrobe.
