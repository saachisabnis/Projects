Sage The Gemini is being accused of sexually assaulting a woman at Chris Brown‘s house in 2017 in a new police report.
According to documents obtained by TMZ, a woman filed the report in Los Angeles on Monday (October 7).  In her account of the incident, she said she met the “Red Nose” rapper on social media and he invited her to Breezy’s house.

While the superstar singer was present when she arrived and had her sign an NDA, the woman noted he was no longer there at the time of the alleged assault and is thus not involved in her allegations. She has not yet specified why she waited to file, but the LAPD is now looking into the claims.
As for Sage, he declined commentary to TMZ, but denied the claims on his Instagram Story later that day, writing: “I ain’t turning shit off lol only people she not Lyin to is police cuz they don’t give out careers! #FindANewHustle”

While he’s not implicated in these allegations of assault, Chris Brown is set to be the subject of a new documentary arriving later this month, which will focus on allegations of violence against the singer throughout his career.
Investigation Discovery’s Chris Brown: A History of Violence will premiere on October 27, kicking off the network’s third annual No Excuse for Abuse campaign.

In a trailer that was released, a woman says in a voiceover: “Chris Brown’s an amazing and talented musician, but let’s call a thing a thing. He’s an abuser of women. Consistently, unapologetically.”
While people have knowledge of his incident with Rihanna in 2009 — as well as alleged incidents of sexual assault over the years — the doc claims to have another alleged victim ready to speak as well.

In a statement, the film’s producers said: “With expert and cultural commentary layered throughout, the documentary provides thoughtful reflections into each survivor’s experience and the psychological destruction in the aftermath of their abuse.”
