Kid Cudi is back. The Cleveland native dropped his latest album Insano with features from Travis Scott, Pharrell, Lil Wayne, and more.

	The 39-year-old rapper originally planned to release the album in September but ended up delaying it to ensure he “makes sure that everything lines up” and could give fans the “best version of himself.” In October, he had a series of tweets promoting Insano, telling fans they would get over 40 songs from him between the main album and the deluxe.

	Earlier this week, he shared the tracklist which included Young Thug, Lil Yachty, DJ Drama, the late XXXTentacion, A$AP Rocky, Skateboard P, Weezy F Baby, and two appearances from his constant collaborator Travis Scott. The hour-long album finally dropped on Friday (Jan. 12) and includes 21 tracks, marking the most he has ever had on an LP. 

	One aspect of Kid Cudi’s new LP has quickly caught people’s attention: A$AP Rocky seemingly disses Drake on “Wow.” The Harlem rapper, who has two children with Rihanna—the 6 God’s ex-girlfriend—raps, “Got it extended in my jeans/ Yeah, my Dickies got the crease, I got kisses on my cheek/ I got glitter on my teeth, I got lipstick on my briefs/ Keep it cool, keep it smooth, why you makin’ a scene?/ Plus my boo got the Glizzy, keep the receipt if it’s beef/ Cheffin’ mans, Boyardee, with the latest Goyard/ Me and my vamp bae got our own handshake/These ni**as can’t stomach me, gotta go get a mandrake.”

	This veiled shot could be interpreted as a response to “Fear Of Heights” and “Another Late Night” from For All The Dogs, where the father of one takes shots at the couple.  

	“X & Cud” marks the first time that Cudi and the late XXXTentacion collaborated on a record. X handles the intro, singing “The pain in my heart just won’t end/ The words that I find just don’t seem to compare/ Awaitin’ my death in the end/ Alone, I must seek out the end to begin.” He continues the theme of pondering his mortality on the bridge, mentioning being tired of having fake friends. 

	Lil Wayne turns in another impressive feature on “Seven,” rapping “Tune’ in this bi**h, ni**a, I tuned out these bi**h ni**as/ Pop off, and we gon’ make balloons out these bi**h ni**as/ She a eater, she gon’ make a spoon out this d**k, ni**a/ Ain’t sh*t sweet, but I could make perfume out this sh*t, ni**a.” He closes the verse by likening himself to Tiger Woods, but says that he is twice as good.
