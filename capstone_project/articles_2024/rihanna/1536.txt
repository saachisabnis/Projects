Natalie Portman recently shared how a chance encounter with Rihanna provided unexpected support during her divorce from Benjamin Millepied. The two celebrities met at the Dior fashion show back in January, and the interaction left a lasting impression on Natalie.
During the event, Rihanna was overheard enthusiastically praising Natalie, saying, “I am a f–king fan. You’re one of the hottest b*tches in Hollywood forever. You do the most innocent look and I’m like ‘ahhhh!’” This moment of admiration from one of the world’s biggest pop stars had a profound impact on Natalie during a challenging time in her personal life.
Natalie and Benjamin, who had been together for over a decade, quietly separated in 2023 and finalized their divorce in March of this year. The couple, who share two children, had been navigating the complexities of their split away from the public eye. The unexpected words of encouragement from Rihanna came at a crucial time for Natalie, offering her a boost of confidence when she needed it most.
Appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Natalie opened up about what that moment meant to her. “It was an amazing experience for me. I think every woman going through a divorce should get to have Rihanna say to her that she’s a bad b**ch,” Natalie shared with a smile. Her words highlighted the power of support and affirmation from other women, especially during difficult times.
