	The song earned 21.7 million official on-demand U.S. streams and sold 3,000 downloads in September, according to Luminate. It peaked at No. 49 on the June 22-dated Billboard Hot 100 and ranks at No. 90 on the most recently published, Oct. 19-dated chart.

Rihanna’s “Love on the Brain,” which appears in the debut season of fellow Netflix series Nobody Wants This, places at No. 2 on Top TV Songs. It racked up 16.4 million streams and sold 2,000 in September. 

	The track, from her album Anti, is heard in the third episode of the series, which stars Kristen Bell and Adam Brody. The single hit No. 5 on the Hot 100 in 2017.

	The song is one of three from Nobody Wants This on the 10-position Top TV Songs chart, joined by Frank Sinatra’s “Theme From New York, New York” (No. 8; 3.4 million streams, 1,000 sold) and HAIM’s “Now I’m In It” (No. 10; 515,000 streams).

	Netflix continues its domination of Top TV Songs’ top three with Crowded House’s “Don’t Dream It’s Over,” at No. 3 after playing in Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. The song, a No. 2 Hot 100 hit in 1987, drew 8.1 million streams and sold 2,000 in September. 

	The classic also reaches Billboard’s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart dated Oct. 19 (with older songs eligible to make Billboard’s multimetric song charts if ranking in the top half and with meaningful reasons for their resurgences). It enters at No. 16 and finds its way onto Rock Digital Song Sales at No. 14 and Alternative Streaming Songs at No. 23.

Milli Vanilli’s “Blame It on the Rain,” also featured in Monsters, likewise hits Top TV Songs, at No. 6 (3.4 million streams, 2,000 sold). Catalog gains for the duo — multiple songs by the pair are featured in Monsters — drives its 4 EP onto the Billboard 200 at No. 197 with 8,000 equivalent album units. It marks Milli Vanilli’s first appearance on the chart in nearly 34 years, since the chart dated Oct. 27, 1990.
