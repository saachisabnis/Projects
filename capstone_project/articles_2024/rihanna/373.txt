Just when you thought they couldn’t get any more brutal
The most anticipated part of Squid Game 2 is not the fact that after three long years the show is finally back, but the fact that a load of new harrowing games for the contestants are going to be our late Boxing Day present. If you thought the brutal games in the first series were something to wince over, the show got bigger and meaner in its absence and this season has a load of terrifying challenges for the players to get on with. Here’s your full guide to all the new games in Squid Game 2 if you are too impatient to wait for the Netflix binge.
The Salesman’s latest tactic to recruit people into the game. He basically asks desperate people to choose between a bread based good and a lottery ticket. If they choose the lottery ticket, they often lose – and he stamps the perfectly edible food into smithereens. This is to prove his point that desperate people often gamble for high risk, high reward options – even when unwise to do so.
Basically a two handed rock paper scissors, where you get to remove an option of your opponent every round you win.
If you’ve not heard the Rihanna song and need this explaining, don’t speak to me. Gi-Hun plays it with The Salesman at the end of episode one – pivotal to him getting back into the game.

This is the first major new one of the Squid Game 2 games, and it’s a deathly mix of mini games that sees the players group together. The groups of five are joined by their legs and have to walk in a circle from station to station where one player does each mini game.
The mini games are as follows:
The brutal Mingle is the final big new game we see in Squid Game 2, and of all the new games it’s probably the best. And by best, I mean carnage. The rules are as follows: Players all spin around on a big merry-go round until it stops and a number is called out over the intercom. When this happens, they have to get in groups of the same amount of number and seek refuge somewhere in the arena.
Anyone who doesn’t get into a group of the right amount of people or who doesn’t find shelter in time is shot by the guards. Ouch.
Squid Game is available on Netflix now. For all the latest Netflix news, drops, quizzes and memes like The Holy Church of Netflix on Facebook.
