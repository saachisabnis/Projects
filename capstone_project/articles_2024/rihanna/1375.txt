Butter nails were all the rage back in the spring, but as the cooler months roll in, many of us typically turn to darker shades – such as oxblood, black or deep plum – on our nails. Not Rihanna, though – true to form, she continues to do her own thing.
While in London to promote the new Fenty Hair Corner Shop in Selfridges, the singer and beauty entrepreneur showcased her own take on the trend. Her long nails were shaped into square tips and painted a buttery-lemon shade of yellow – a mani that paired perfectly with an eye-catching pale yellow teddy dress.

While trends aren’t really her thing (she sets, she doesn’t follow), the style of Rih’s hair was also very much de rigueur. Along with the likes of Victoria Beckham and Sophie Turner, she’s rocking a midi-bob – otherwise known as 2024’s hottest chop. Her hair was styled into glamorous, bouncy waves, complete with deep side-parting and high-shine finish.
