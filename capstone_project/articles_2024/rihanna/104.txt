Future and Metro Boomin’s We Don’t Trust You track “Like That” featuring Kendrick Lamar planted the seed for Lamar’s eventual “Not Like Us” victory lap. Future and Metro Boomin are enjoying a victory lap of their own in their We Trust You Tour. The North American trek is in support of We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, their joint albums that each hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
The We Trust You Tour began at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri last week and will continue through the rest of the summer.
According to fans’ relaying on setlist.fm, Metro Boomin and Future’s set began at 9:45 p.m. local time in St. Paul, Minnesota on July 31. Fans commented on Reddit that Metro came on stage at 10 p.m., followed by Future at 10:30 p.m., in Detroit, Michigan on August 4. 
If that’s true, you can probably bank on the show consistently starting around 10 p.m. local time.
