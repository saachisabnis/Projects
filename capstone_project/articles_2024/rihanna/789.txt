Apple says these will be available in 5-, 10-, and 20-minute episodes, and that new ones will be added weeklyThe service is also adding to its more strenuous workouts, with "Strength, Core, and Yoga for Golfers," which was designed and features professional golfer Rose Zhang alongside trainer Kyle Ardill."To play at my best, the training that I do off the course is so important," said Zhang. "Incorporating strength, core, and mobility workouts helps make sure my body and mind are ready.""Whether people are new to the sport or want to advance their skills," she continued, "I'm excited that the workouts in this program on Fitness+ will help users feel more confident in their swing and have fun on the course." See the nicer side of "Silo" star Common in Time to WalkThe new sound meditations and golfers' workout will be available from January 8, 2024, as will the next series of Time to Walk.
