R&B sensation Muni Long has emerged as the frontrunner in this year’s Grammy nominations, securing four nods that solidify her position as a powerhouse in contemporary rhythm and blues.
The Recording Academy’s announcement positions Long at the forefront of the R&B categories, with nominations spanning both traditional and contemporary classifications. Her emotional ballad “Make Me Forget” earned a nomination for best traditional R&B performance, while “Made For Me,” captured live during a memorable BET performance, competes in the best R&B performance category.
Long’s songwriting prowess earned additional recognition with “Ruined Me” landing in the best R&B song category, a songwriter’s award. Her album “Revenge” rounds out her nominations, competing for best R&B album.
The nominations mark a continued ascent for Long, who first gained widespread attention after transitioning from behind-the-scenes songwriting to center stage. The artist, born Priscilla Renea Hamilton, had previously written hits for other artists before launching her own successful career as Muni Long.
The multiple nominations reflect Long’s versatility within the genre, seamlessly moving between traditional R&B elements and contemporary sounds. Her live performance of “Made For Me” on BET showcased her vocal abilities and stage presence, which have become hallmarks of her artistry.
“Revenge,” Long’s nominated album, has garnered critical acclaim for its bold exploration of relationships and personal growth. The project collaborates with several prominent producers and showcases Long’s evolution as a vocalist and songwriter.
The album’s commercial success matched its critical reception, maintaining substantial yearly streaming numbers. “Make Me Forget” has accumulated millions of streams across platforms.
Long’s journey to this year’s Grammy nominations reflects a broader trend in R&B, where artists increasingly blend traditional elements with modern production and storytelling. Her success particularly resonates with her background as a songwriter, having penned hits for artists including Ariana Grande, Rihanna, and Madonna before stepping into the spotlight herself.
The nominations also mark a significant moment for BET, with Long’s live performance of “Made For Me” earning recognition in a competitive Grammy category. The network has historically played a crucial role in providing platforms for R&B artists to showcase their talents.
As the Grammy ceremony approaches, Long’s four nominations position her as a leading voice in contemporary R&B, building on the foundation she laid with her breakthrough hit “Hrs and Hrs.” That single earned her first Grammy nomination and established her as a force in the industry.
The 2025 Grammy Awards ceremony will occur at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 2nd.
