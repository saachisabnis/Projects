	Public figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Hilary Clinton, and Bob Iger were in attendance at the star-studded wedding of Anant Ambani and fiancée Radhika Merchant, with Rihanna playing a concert for the happy couple during the wedding reception. But along with these figures, Ivanka Trump was also in attendance, and the photos she posted show what her focus is right now.

	










	On March 1, Ivanka shared a series of photos from the A-list-packed wedding of billionaire heir Ambani and Merchant to her Instagram. She shared the photos with the caption reading, “First night in India ~ a magical evening in Everland ! 🇮🇳🪷 Sending warm wishes to Anant and Radhika for endless happiness and love as they embark on this wonderful adventure together.”

	While many photos show how she, her husband Jared Kushner, and their daughter were dressed for the evening, along with pics of the ornate interior, many noted IVanka’s first ensemble of the event: a dazzling silver and gold paneled, flowing ensemble from Manish Malhotra with statement earrings from Manish Malhotra as well.



	Then the morning of March 2, Ivanka shared another one of her looks, and more pics from the wedding. She shared the photos with the caption reading, “The celebration of Anant and Radhika’s love continues on our second night in India ! 🌟🇮🇳🪷”

	Next, we see Ivanka in an array of sparkling sapphire and silver jewelry from the same brand Manish Malhotra Jewellery, as well as an intricate white two-piece from Manish Malhotra.

	These stylish appearances, mixed with her subtle outings for fashion designers and more socialite-based events may show that she’s ready to be the fashion-conscious public figure she was before her father, former US President Donald Trump, went into office in 2016.
