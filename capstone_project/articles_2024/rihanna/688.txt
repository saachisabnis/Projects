LSDXOXO will be coming out with his debut album. Entitled Dogma, the LP will arrive on September 13 through his own record label, Fantasy Audio Group. Its first single, “4Luvn,” is out for streaming now.
Born in Philadelphia and presently based in Berlin, LSDXOXO is known for his unique production style, blending samples from pop artists like Lady Gaga and Rihanna with hardcore and club beats. He began self-releasing mixtapes and promoting them on Tumblr in the early 2010s ahead of dropping his first EP Softcore in 2013.
Since then, the producer has put out five more EPs and produced for artists, including Lady Gaga’s Chromatica remix album and Kelela’s latest LP, Raven.
Dogma will span 11 songs, including one that Kelela provided backup vocals for. There’s also a guest appearance from Rochelle Jordan.
