Taylor Russell might be debuting a new look. The actor hit the jury photocall at the “Luigi De Laurentiis” Venice Award for a Debut Film earlier today in an archival piece of fashion. The star wore a gray vintage jacket and skirt from John Galliano with a pair of sheer heels that strap up the ankle from Gianvito Rossi.
The look is one of the first looks for Russell that have been styled by Jahleel Weaver. Weaver is largely known for his work as Rihanna’s stylist and as a creative director at Fenty. But this year he’s been taking on increasingly more clients including Dua Lipa and now Russell. Russel had previously made waves working with the stylist Ryan Hastings.

For their first big outing together, Weaver and Russel opted for a wool jacket and skirt look from Galliano’s spring 1995 runway collection. It features a cinched waist, padded shoulders and small bow detailing on the sleeves. The skirt features a split up the back, likely for range of motion.

For shoes, Russell wore a pair of black custom heels from Gianvito Rossi. They feature a sheer, pointed toe box. Sheer has been a trend with a long life over the past few years, heavily impacting the footwear market. The heel likely measures almost four inches and features straps that go up the bottom of the leg and are synced via tying them into a bow. 
While Gianvito Rossi doesn’t sell this exact style, they do have similar ones. The brand does offer what it calls a round toe pump with a sheer upper. It differs from Russell’s version in that the toe is rounded and the heel is beautifully sculpted. Farfetch still has that style for as low as $388. 
“It has a lot to do with overall aesthetics,” trend forecaster Kendall Becker told FN late last year. “A lot of these mesh shoes we’re seeing are very staple silhouettes, like a very classic pump or a ballet flat, that are typically more modest. This is a really fun and romantic way to showcase a little extra edge and make something a little bit more daring, but it’s a nice balancing act.”
