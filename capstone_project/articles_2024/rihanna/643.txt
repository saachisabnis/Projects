While on the red carpet, he showed off his specially designed ring that featured his birthstone, alongside Rihanna’s and their two kids’. The piece, which was custom designed by Popular Jewelry, is dubbed the Quadruple R ring and is representative of himself (real name Rakim Mayers), Rihanna (real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty), and their children RZA and Riot.
Check out a video featuring the ring below.
Last October, A$AP Rocky and Rihanna celebrated the former’s 35th birthday together in New York City’s Harlem district. 
Rih rocked all black with a tulle top, high-heel leggings, and a cropped bomber jacket, while the birthday boy went for a bit of a throwback look with a shirt and tie under a grey sweater and a plaid blazer. He paired it with baggy jeans, black boots, a pink Bottega bag and tons of of pearl clips in his hair.

The outing arrived just after Rihanna and A$AP Rocky debuted the first photos of their newborn baby boy, Riot, in a heart-melting shoot with their one-year-old son, RZA.
The family photos were shared by the A-list couple’s go-to photographer DIGGZY, with RiRi and Rocky taking turns holding baby Riot Rose, who was in a pink onesie and matching du-rag of sorts to go along with his Timberland boots.
