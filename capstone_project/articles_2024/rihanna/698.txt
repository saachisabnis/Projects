Eva Amurri is addressing criticism about her wedding dress.
The actor wrote about her low-cut dress, and the backlash it received online, in a post on her "Happily Eva After" blog titled "What My Wedding Dress Taught Me About Why We're F-----."
Amurri, daughter of Susan Sarandon and director Franco Amurri, tied the knot with chef Ian Hock on June 29 in a strapless bustier-style Kim Kassas gown and lengthy veil, People reported.
In the blog post, Amurri said she was "so excited to share a glimpse" of her "perfect day" with the world. She didn't see the response until hours later.
"When I finally checked in on the post to see it, I was so taken aback by the fact that it was already viral….and for two reasons completely out of my control: My Breasts," she wrote.
Amurri said that she didn't expect "people would have such a strong reaction" to how her body looked in the wedding dress that she chose to wear.
She went on to describe her intention behind the dress, and that her look was entirely deliberate.
"I had purposefully gone into my wedding dress shopping wanting to show my figure and really celebrate myself as a woman — body parts included. Sexy and Elegant were two words that I mentioned at every dress appointment," she wrote.
Being "picked apart by strangers" through their "cruel comments" brought "hot tears" to her eyes, she wrote.
"It was the yucky feeling of knowing that there are people out there (and lots of them!) whose immediate reaction upon witnessing my little family’s joy was to try to hurt us," she wrote.
The backlash, she wrote, made her "worried for all of us." While she didn't have a "mission statement" or an "answer" following the experiences, she told followers not to climb into a box to please others.
"You don’t need anybody’s permission to make the choices you make for yourself. And when people feel something about those choice? Well, that’s none of your business," she wrote.
Amurri previously responded to critics online. The day after her wedding, she uploaded pictures with Hock on Instagram and decided to respond to the critical comments about her low-cut dress.
Below one picture that showed the 39-year-old embracing her husband, she raved about the ceremony and revealed that it rained.
“So much to share from this day, and so many thoughts. But it was really the most special day filled with so so much love and the most incredible energy. The rain (which I stressed about for a week) ended up being,” she said and included two sparkle emoji.
She said the pair decided to take photos despite the downpour that altered her hairstyle, which took two hours to perfect.
“It was the best reminder that you get exactly what you’re supposed to, and everything works out. Also everyone’s skin was GIVINGGGG in the rain, honeyyyy lol.” she said.
For her next post, she added a message to those who weren’t fans of her wedding day attire.
“And to anyone scandalized by my breasts not being ‘put away’....” she captioned a photo.
She then zoomed in on her chest in the next post and cheekily said, “Feel free to screenshot this for later,” with a kissing face emoji.
The actor continued to upload photos from their rain-filled nuptials, including one that showed the train of her dress drenched in water and mud and a video of the guests holding umbrellas as they, fittingly, danced to Rihanna’s hit “Umbrella.”
Amurri explained why she chose the corseted gown in an interview with People.
“I love how it has a vintage feel and is ultra feminine without being overly pouffy,” she shared. “I wanted to feel sexy but elegant, and I think the dress strikes the perfect balance.”
The mom of three shares her children with ex-husband Kyle Martino, whom she split from in 2020. All of her children were included in the ceremony and her mother also attended, the outlet reported.
According to People, Amurri and Hock’s first dance song was Taylor Swift’s “Lover.” She added the song to one of her Instagram story posts on July 1.
“It’s always meant a lot to us in our relationship,” she explained to People. “Then we danced a family dance to ‘Joy’ by Andy Grammer, which is our special family song.”
