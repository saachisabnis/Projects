Rihanna attended Mariah Carey's final Christmas Time Tour concert at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday. She joined the crowd in singing along to holiday favorites and then met Mariah backstage. In a popular video from their meeting, Carey signed Rihanna's chest while Rihanna grabbed the mic and exclaimed, “Mariah Carey is signing my t**. This sht is fcking epic.” Later, Carey shared her thoughts on Instagram, posting pictures and videos from the show. She thanked her fans, saying, “Lambs, thank you for making my #Christmastime so special. I’ve loved singing with you every night, and I can’t wait to see you all tomorrow in Brooklyn for the last show of the tour.” Fans were thrilled to see Carey back on stage after she had to cancel three previous concerts due to the flu, which included stops in Pittsburgh, Newark, and Belmont. She expressed her disappointment on X (formerly Twitter) on December 11, stating, “Pittsburgh, I am sorry to say, I’ve come down with the flu. It breaks my heart that I unfortunately have to cancel tonight’s show. I love you all so much.” Two days later, she confirmed she wasn't ready to perform yet, saying, "Newark and Belmont — I wish I had better news but unfortunately I’m still sick and have to cancel the shows tonight and on Sunday." In other news, Rihanna's husband, ASAP Rocky, recently mentioned they are working on new music together. He told E! News that something is "in the works."
