Naomi Campbell is addressing the rumors that she has an issue with Rihanna.
Earlier this month, the supermodel alongside celebrity stylist, Law Roach, attended the Alaïa Spring 2025 runway show during New York Fashion Week. Rihanna also attended the show, however, she was reportedly one of the last people to arrive. In a clip from the show, the singer can be seen greeting former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful before she walked past Roach and Campbell to get to her seat. 
Once the event was over, another video surface on social media and it was of Roach and Campbell seemingly talking about Rihanna’s late arrival to the show.

However, Naomi Campbell is now addressing the rumors that the comments were about the singer.  “I’m not about to let the world pitch two Black women against each other,” she said. “We are two women with two children, mothers.” 
According to reports, Naomi Campbell and Rihanna have been friends for a long time and they were both in 2014 campaign for Balmain. They were also seen together at the CFDA Fashion Awards and at various FENTY x Puma events over the years. 
Law Roach also commented on the alleged beef and said that the public was just making things up. “What’s so funny to me that in this universe of the internet and social media that y’all live in, y’all always think something has to be something. But something ain’t always something,” he said in a video posted on social media. “Sometimes something is just nothing. So stop trying to make nothing into something. Y’all need to get some business.”
