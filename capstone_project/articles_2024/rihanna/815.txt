Still deluding myself that Justin Bieber might perform x 
Yesterday’s Super Bowl had a whole new genre of audience with Taylor Swift in attendance and a lot of people have questions. Chiefly, WHERE on earth was Justin Bieber, What was poor Alicia’s throat doing to her in that first note and what did Travis Kelce scream at his poor coach?
Swifties have been going feral, as they always do, not just at Taylor’s appearance in Vegas at the match but also at her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s rage in the match at his elderly coach. People are trying to work out what he says, people are saying it’s a red flag and she should leave him, it’s chaos.

When both teams are red, it's hard for Elmo to pick which team to root for. Elmo will cheer for both! ❤️
