It’s time to write Taylor Swift’s name atop the list of the world’s wealthiest female music artists — the “Shake it Off” singer is now in the No. 1 spot, according to Forbes.
The business magazine estimated in an update this week that Swift’s net worth comes in at $1.6 billion. The staggering figure surpassed the amount amassed by the previous holder of the title, Rihanna, who Forbes reported is worth $1.4 billion.
The 34-year-old Swift, who made headlines last month with her high-profile endorsement of Vice President Harris in the White House race — reportedly became a billionaire last year because of earnings from her worldwide “The Eras Tour” and music catalog.
On Forbes’s list of the world’s billionaires, Swift took 2,117th place. 
Her wealth comes in second among entertainers only to Jay-Z. The rapper and business mogul’s net worth totals $2.5 billion, the publication reported.
