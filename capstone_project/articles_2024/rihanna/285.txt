JAY-Z, Wale and Cordae were among the less enthusiastic when the Washington Commanders lost to the Dallas Cowboys this past weekend – but former Cowboy Dez Bryant was loving it.
On Sunday (November 24), the guys all watched the Commanders’ home game from a box suite that also included Michael Rubin, Peter Rosenberg and more. Upon their loss, Dez couldn’t help but to relish the moment.

“How you feeling?” he asked his suite-mates in between laughs. A visibly annoyed Cordae waved him off, while Hov entertained him at first, then also brushed him off.
Michael Rubin and Wale flipped the camera off, with Wale adding, “We’ll be back! And I’m coming to the Dallas game too.” Rosenberg noted, “We don’t need this at this time.”

Before the Commanders were sold in 2023, JAY-Z was rumored to be interested in buying the team alongside Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
In November 2022, Hov was spotted having dinner with Bezos in Los Angeles, days after word got out they wanted to put in a bid for the team.

However, the team was ultimately sold to investor Josh Harris for a reported $6.05 billion.
While that deal didn’t pan out, Bloomberg reported last month that the NFL has extended its deal with JAY-Z and Roc Nation to oversee the annual halftime show, as well as its social justice initiatives.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly praised the company and its CEO Desiree Perez at a league owners meeting in Atlanta, saying: “It’s been a mutually positive relationship.”
He added: “I’m not sure either one of us really spend much time talking about contracts. Jay is happy. Desiree Perez is happy. I’m happy, so we’re all good.”

JAY-Z and the NFL first joined forces in 2019, with the initial deal amounting to $25 million over five years, according to ESPN. It’s unclear how much this new deal is worth and how long it will last.
The partnership was widely criticized due to the league’s alleged blackballing of former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick, who has been unable to find a team since taking a knee during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.

Despite the backlash, Hov has put Black music front and center at the Super Bowl halftime show, organizing performances from The Weeknd, Rihanna and Usher, as well as an all-star set from Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige and 50 Cent.
Kendrick will return to headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show in New Orleans next February.
