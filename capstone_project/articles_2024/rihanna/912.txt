Eminem has announced a deluxe edition of The Death Of Slim Shady, and he’s enlisted The Alchemist to help get the word out with a cinematic trailer.
Shared to Instagram on Tuesday (September 10), the clip finds Em strolling a convenience store with the legendary producer at the register. He then slices open a milk carton and spills it everywhere, prompting Al to yell at him to “get the fuck out of here” – but not before the camera zooms in to show a missing persons ad on the milk carton featuring Slim Shady.

“MISSING: SLIM SHADY!! Have you seen him?” Em wrote in the caption, revealing The Death Of Slim Shady: Expanded Mourner’s Edition drops in just a few days [appropriately] on Friday (September 13).
While Alc doesn’t appear on the first edition of the album, it’s possible his appearance hints at some production on the expanded edition, though it has not been confirmed.

In other news, Eminem is set to kick off the MTV Video Music Awards this week for the first time in almost 15 years — since he did it with Rihanna.
Per Billboard, Slim Shady is scheduled to open the VMAs on Wednesday (September 11) at the UBS arena, just outside of NYC. The last time he did that was back in 2010, when he and Rih duetted on “Love the Way You Lie.”

In the years since, Em has actually performed at the show several more times: in 2012 with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg; and again with just Snoop in 2022.
The iconic rapper has eight VMA nominations this year, six of which are for “Houdini.” He has the most VMA wins of any Hip Hop artist ever, and the second-most nominations in history of any artist, behind Madonna.

“Houdini” was a smash success upon its release in June, debuting at number two on the Hot 100, according to Billboard, becoming the Detroit rapper’s highest charting single since his Rihanna collaboration “The Monster” hit the top spot in 2013.
“Houdini”’s first-week streams totalled just shy of 50 million, while it also notched up four million radio impressions as the nostalgic track continues to perform well with audiences.
