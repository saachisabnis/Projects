Music wouldn't be music without songwriters. You can play, you can sing, but without the song itself it's just noise. Some, but not all, performers are songwriters. Yesterday, some of the best songwriters in music were recognized as the inductees for the 2024 Songwriters Hall Of Fame were revealed.
The names cover multiple genres: alternative rock legends R.E.M. and classic rock giants Steely Dan, along with non-performing songwriters Hillary Lindsey, Timbaland and Dean Pitchford.
R.E.M and Steely Dan require no introduction, as both legendary acts are members of the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame. The non-performers, most people know, at least by their work.
The Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees will be honored during the 53rd Annual Induction and Awards Gala at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City on June 13.
See some of the biggest hits written or co-written by Hillary Lindsey, Timbaland and Dean Pitchford to the right. 
Songwriters that were nominated but didn't get in this year included Debbie Harry, Chris Stein and Clem Burke of Blondie; Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart; Bryan Adams; Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings of The Guess Who; Tracy Chapman; George Clinton; Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons and Michael McDonald of The Doobie Brothers; David Gates of Bread; Kenny Loggins; and Chuck D and Flavor Flav of Public Enemy.
