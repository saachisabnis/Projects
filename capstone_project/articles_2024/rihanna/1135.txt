Cardi B is known for giving fans an unfiltered peek into her life, and now she’s recounted an awkward run-in with Rihanna and Paris Hilton.
The “Bodak Yellow” rapper was one of several celebrity guests who attended a fundraising dinner hosted by Jason Lee in Los Angeles last week.

However, the glitzy affair didn’t quite go as planned for Cardi as she suffered an “embarrassing” mishap that made her hide herself under the covers when she returned home.
“Let me tell you what happened at the Jason Lee party,” she explained on Instagram Live. “I was really upset because … it was a dinner and I was eating, I was hungry. So I’m talking to Paris Hilton, I’m talking to Rihanna. I’m smiling because when I get nervous I smile.”

“I’m like, ‘Oh my God, yeah!'” she added, making light of her social anxiety. “I’m all up in Paris Hilton’s face because we sitting right next to each other. When I fucking went home, you know what I noticed? That I have something black right here [points to one of her front teeth]. I noticed I had something black in my fucking teeth the whole time! Oh my gosh!”
The Bronx rap star then likened the incident a scene from the film The Emperor’s New Groove where the evil sorceress realizes she has a piece of food stuck in her teeth.
“That’s all I could think about!” Bardi continued. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I hope that [Paris] didn’t notice’ … When I got home and I noticed that, I just literally buried myself in my fucking bed ’cause that shit is so fucking embarrassing.”
Despite Cardi B’s embarrassment, the party’s host, Jason Lee, shared a different sentiment on Instagram, enthusiastically praising the event’s success.
“Cardi loves @badgalriri just as much as I do. But she’s a damn Libra, an introvert, and shy as hell. It’s so cute and humbling to see the biggest rap artist in the world be so shy around her,” he captioned a photo carousel highlighting guests like Cardi and RiRi.

He continued: “So what do I do as a friend. Sit them right across from each other [crying face emoji]. Blessed to share such a special night for the Hollywood Cares Foundation with two amazing women that I love so much.
“All we talked about was life, family, support, and how the work of this non profit. Getting people these busy together ain’t easy but I think they love me!”
