Tennis phenom Coco Gauff just proved that she’s just like the rest of us, saying she’d love to break bread with singer, entrepreneur and all-around boss Rihanna.
After beating Clara Burel in a match during the 2024 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, reporters asked number three seeded Gauff to name her ideal dinner guest in a post match press conference. And after narrowing her choices down to  R&B divas and  entrepreneurs Beyoncé and Rihanna, the 19 year old settled on the Fenty Beauty boss, saying she’s a fan of the brand known for being inclusive of every hue. 
“I’m going to go with Rihanna, just because I would love to hear how, like, she started Fenty Beauty because that was kind of one of the first makeup brands to provide a full shade range of foundation for all skin tones,” Gauff said. 
Gauff added that while she doesn’t have a formal business plan of her own yet, she  hopes to one day follow in Bey and RiRi’s entrepreneurial footsteps and eventually launch her own business in either the fashion or beauty industry. 
“I haven’t done any brainstorming or anything like that. But it’s definitely something I want to do later on in my career,” she said.
But the youngest American woman to win the U.S. Open since Serena Williams who has seven WTA singles titles under her belt isn’t ready to put down her  racket right now. Gauff says she’ll probably start thinking about making her business dreams a reality as she gets closer to 30.
“I’m not planning on starting anything anytime soon. I think I just want to focus on tennis. But I would say towards the later half of my career,” she said.
