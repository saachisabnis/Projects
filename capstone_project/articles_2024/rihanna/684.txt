The reveal follows Rihanna’s recent acquisition of a lucrative partnership with the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.
Last month, the “Umbrella” singer, 36, took to socials to celebrate the “proud” occasion, sharing a snapshot of herself posing with a life-size lippie against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. The Olympic banner at the top of the photo added the perfect touch.
“tried to tell yall….we outside all 2024!!! PROUD to announce that @FentyBeauty is a premium partner of the Olympic AND Paralympic Games baby!!! #FentyxParis2024 💄🏆,” she wrote in the caption.

Ahead of her Olympic break, Rihanna launched her highly anticipated haircare line, “Fenty Hair.” On Instagram, she teased the launch with, “a new family is moving in,” complete with a video of herself showcasing a blonde pixie cut. She described the line as “a flexible line of products for not only every hair want, but every single product is designed to strengthen and repair all types of hair,” emphasizing the importance of versatile hair care.
Rihanna’s Fenty empire continues to thrive, bolstered by a slew of positive reviews and significant revenue. With Fenty Beauty generating around $1 billion in 2022, it plays a major role in her estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. Her stake in Fenty Beauty and her successful lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, contribute substantially to her wealth, surpassing even her musical achievements.
