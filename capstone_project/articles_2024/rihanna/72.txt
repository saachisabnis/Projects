Puma has teamed up with popular plush toy brand Squishmallows on three low-top sneaker styles and a kids’ apparel collection. Revealed on Thursday, the collection features shoes inspired by different Squishmallows characters. 
The RS-X Cam gives the ’90s throwback sneaker a coloring inspired by Cam the calico cat, with a muted overall colorway and colorful sole. The Suede XL Winston is decked out in bright teal suede with a fuzzy teal Formstrip inspired by Winston the Owl. The Cali Lola features a lilac suede body with fuzzy purple detailing and purple laces, a nod to Lola the unicorn.

 









Each of the three styles features the Puma logo inside a rainbow and the correspondent character on the tongue, along with a charm. The styles come in kids’ and adults’ sizes, allowing parents to match with their little ones.

The kids’ apparel line is also inspired by Cam, Winston and Lola, with coordinating colors to match the shoes. It includes graphic tees, shorts, T-shirt dresses, two-piece sets and more. 
The Puma x Squishmallows collection retails for $28 to $85 and will be available for purchase starting March 15 on puma.com, the Puma app, the Puma NYC flagship store and at selected Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores.
Puma has already had a busy year of collaborations, including with skate brand X-Girl, the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament, NBA rookie Scoot Henderson and Rihanna’s Fenty, who has partnered with the German sports brand in the past. At the upcoming 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, the Egyptian team will be decked out in Puma.
