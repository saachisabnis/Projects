	It’s official: Taylor Swift is very, very rich.

	The ‘Eras Tour’ singer-songwriter has joined the Forbes World’s Billionaires list, one of 14 celebrities who, according to the magazine, are worth a collective $31 billion. Swift’s achievement is all the more noteworthy, Forbes says, because last October she accomplished “a feat no other musician had before: she became a  billionaire strictly off of earnings from her music and performances.” 

	Also on the list: Dick Wolf, Rihanna, Tyler Perry, Peter Jackson and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Take a look below, along with Forbes’ descriptions. (The net worths are as of March 8, 2024).
