Do I…do I need a suede newsboy cap? I thought newsboy caps had been over since Keira Knightley in Love Actually, but seeing Salma Hayek in a gray suede newsboy cap to match her cashmere sweatsuit has me rethinking my whole hat ethos.
Looking cute while remaining comfortable at the airport is no easy task, but Hayek managed to do it in her gray cashmere set at the Athens airport, where she was photographed on November 19. She paired the cozy ’fit with white sneaks and tortoiseshell sunglasses, letting her black T-shirt peak out from below the sweater.
But amazingly, the item that really ties the whole look together is the newsboy cap.
Now, I wasn’t being completely honest before when I said the newsboy, with its characteristic short brim and roomy crown, was dead and buried for good. And I’m not just talking about the Shelby brothers. In 2023 Anne Hathaway evoked her The Devil Wears Prada character by wearing a navy blue, sailor-like cap to accessorize her peacoat and wide-leg jeans. And Rihanna gave the pageboy cap a chic upgrade in January by pairing it with a black coat and a pencil skirt to sit front row at the Dior show for Paris fashion week.
Now that Salma Hayek has donned the controversial headgear, I think it’s time to call it. Newsboy caps are no longer just for Peaky Blinders and 2000s rom-com leads anymore.
