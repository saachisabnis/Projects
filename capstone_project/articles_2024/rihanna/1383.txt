10) Big Thief – “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You” (2022)


Brooklyn-based folk band Big Thief has been at the forefront of modern folk music with their intricate lyricism and gorgeous instrumentation to back it up. Despite their latest album being over 2 years old, the DJs of KCSU were playing this one a lot last week for our DJathon fundraiser.


There are so many gorgeous moments on this album it was so hard to pick just one. From the playful “Time Escaping” reminiscent of Minnie Ripperton, to the contemplative “Promise Is A Pendulum”, and the hypnotic, “Heavy Bend”. A lot of this group’s success is accredited to songwriter Adrienne Lenker, who is no stranger to the Weekly Gems.


This week, we’re highlighting the track” Spud Infinity”, a twangy ballad with a memorable mouth harp throughout the song.


9) Crumb – “AMAMA” (2024)


Back with their third album, Brooklyn-based psychedelic-rock band Crumb brings a lighthearted vibe to “AMAMA”. The band consists of Lila Ramani, Bri Aronow, Jesse Brotter, and Jonathan Gilad. With poetic lyrics written by Ramani, and hypnotic instrumental, this album is full of bright spots.
The title of the album, “AMAMA”, is the word for ‘grandmother’ in many Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, which is reflective of Ramani’s Indian heritage. The title makes more sense when you dive into the title track which opens with a sample of Ramani’s grandmother singing in Malayalam.
This week we’re highlighting the track “(Alone in) Brussels” a lush track with some cascading piano chords and vocals.


8) Jamie XX – “In Waves” (2024)


Since 2006, James Thomas Smith has been a part of the musical world. Beginning with the band The xx, Smith honed his talent for sampling and remixing before going out under the name Jamie xx to release solo work. He received acclaim for remixes of a Gil Scott-Heron album, “I’m New Here”, entitled “We’re New Here”. Most notably his remix of the song “I’ll Take Care of You” was used as the base of Drake and Rihanna’s 2011 hit “Take Care”.
In this new album, Jamie xx uses the staple sounds of house music with some R&B samples to create an irresistibly danceable set of songs. The use of horn also adds a lot of flare to the album on tracks like “Baddy On The Floor” and “Life”. “In Waves” also features many of the artist’s longtime collaborators like The Avalanches, and Romy who was also a member of The xx.
The highlighted track this week, “Waited All Night” features former The xx member, Romy for an upbeat spot on this week’s list.


7) Amyl and the Sniffers – “Cartoon Darkness” (2024)


This pub-rock band from Melbourne is lead by Amy Taylor along with Bryce Wilson, Declan Mehrtens, and Gus Romer. The band was formed out of a roommate dynamic turned musical group and they quickly became locally known for their high energy performances and edgy lyrics. Their self-titled debut album got the band some more widespread recognition and Taylor was even included on the list “The 15 Australian female artists changing the game right now” from Happy Mag.


Their newest album expands on the sound fans have come to love, ample in attitude and intensity. The singles “Facts” and “U Should Not Be Doing That” became instant fan favorites to excite listeners for their upcoming tour. They also sparked some controversy with the music video of the song “Jerkin” which featured nudity and obscene language, something Amyl and the Sniffers have proven they do not fear being judged for.


This week’s highlighted track, “Bailing On Me”, is a comparatively less aggressive moment on this album. The vocal delivery feels sweet and the instrumentation leaves room to build and breathe with the listener.


6) Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)


Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “The Ballad of Matt & Mica” is the album’s closer. It brings back several musical motifs from the project and crescendos to punctuate this release.


5) Billie Eilish – “HIT ME HARD AND SOFT” (2024)


Billie Eilish exploded onto the indie-pop scene back in 2015 with the release of her first single, “Ocean Eyes”. The track was the public’s first taste of what would become the hitmaking duo, Billie Eilish’s vocals and songwriting paired up with the production of her brother, FINNEAS.
With the success of her EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” and albums, “When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?” and “Happier Than Ever” the singer became known for her more melancholy tracks. With a knack for writing about the sadness that comes with growing up, Elish was enlisted to write one of the most emotionally hard-hitting songs for the soundtrack of “Barbie” (2023), which earned the singer her second Oscar.
The highlighted track, “CHIHIRO” gets its title from the movie “Spirited Away” (2001). A move known for its gentle atmosphere and intense emotional payoff, this song is no different.


4) Bluhm – “Midnight Hill” (2024)


Detroit dream pop duo Bluhm released their second LP in August after their debut album from last year. According to Bandcamp, they describe their genre as “music for lovers and leavers”, infusing their sound with folk, indie, and pop.


On this album, Bluhm’s vocal duets rise along with the synth-embellished melodies, creating an emanating feeling of nostalgia for the future. Their fantastical pop reminiscence shows a vulnerability, finding solace in sharing hopes and fears.


The highlighted track of this week, “Under the Glow of Your Moon” has a moody opening with sparse tambourines and withholding vocals.


3) Hippo Campus – “Flood” (2024)


Hailing from St. Paul, Minnesota, bedroom pop band Hippo Campus is back with the release of their 4th full-length album, “Flood”. On this album the band attempts to step away from any preconceived notions of how their music ‘should’ sound, instead deciding to start creating this album from a clean slate.
With themes of vulnerability across the record, the group aimed to capture a universal feeling that everyone can relate to. This new set of songs demonstrates what can be made when you have a tight-knit group that has been growing together both musically and personally, strengthening their bond with their art and their fans.
The highlighted track, “Forget It” has a quicker tempo than much of this album, marking it as a standout in this batch of songs.


2) Suki Waterhouse – Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” (2024)


Starting out as a model and actress, Suki Waterhouse began releasing music in 2016 with her single, “Brutally”. Some of the works Waterhouse is most recognizable for are her roles in “Love, Rosie”, “Detective Pikachu”, and “Daisy Jones & the Six”.


As she continued balancing her acting and singing careers, her first full-length album, “I Can’t Let Go” wasn’t released until 2022. This latest release, “Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” comes after the artist opened for Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” at Wembley Stadium.


This week’s highlighted track, “Lullaby”, lives up to the name in its gentle overtones and drawn-out vocals.


1)beabadoobee – “This Is How Tomorrow Moves” (2024)


British singer/songwriter beabadoobee comes from the Philippines and takes inspiration from Pinoy vocalists as well as indie rock artists like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Alex G. The singer first gained notoriety when placed on a list with other rising acts, like Billie Eilish, and led to beabadoobee touring with Clairo to support her Immunity tour.


Her song, “Coffee” was sampled for a TikTok song, “Death Bed” by Powfu, which is when the singer really made her way into the public spotlight. This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.


The highlighted track this week, “One Time” builds up to one of the best parts of this album with its memorable outro.

The title of the album, “AMAMA”, is the word for ‘grandmother’ in many Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, which is reflective of Ramani’s Indian heritage. The title makes more sense when you dive into the title track which opens with a sample of Ramani’s grandmother singing in Malayalam.
This week we’re highlighting the track “(Alone in) Brussels” a lush track with some cascading piano chords and vocals.


8) Jamie XX – “In Waves” (2024)


Since 2006, James Thomas Smith has been a part of the musical world. Beginning with the band The xx, Smith honed his talent for sampling and remixing before going out under the name Jamie xx to release solo work. He received acclaim for remixes of a Gil Scott-Heron album, “I’m New Here”, entitled “We’re New Here”. Most notably his remix of the song “I’ll Take Care of You” was used as the base of Drake and Rihanna’s 2011 hit “Take Care”.
In this new album, Jamie xx uses the staple sounds of house music with some R&B samples to create an irresistibly danceable set of songs. The use of horn also adds a lot of flare to the album on tracks like “Baddy On The Floor” and “Life”. “In Waves” also features many of the artist’s longtime collaborators like The Avalanches, and Romy who was also a member of The xx.
The highlighted track this week, “Waited All Night” features former The xx member, Romy for an upbeat spot on this week’s list.


7) Amyl and the Sniffers – “Cartoon Darkness” (2024)


This pub-rock band from Melbourne is lead by Amy Taylor along with Bryce Wilson, Declan Mehrtens, and Gus Romer. The band was formed out of a roommate dynamic turned musical group and they quickly became locally known for their high energy performances and edgy lyrics. Their self-titled debut album got the band some more widespread recognition and Taylor was even included on the list “The 15 Australian female artists changing the game right now” from Happy Mag.


Their newest album expands on the sound fans have come to love, ample in attitude and intensity. The singles “Facts” and “U Should Not Be Doing That” became instant fan favorites to excite listeners for their upcoming tour. They also sparked some controversy with the music video of the song “Jerkin” which featured nudity and obscene language, something Amyl and the Sniffers have proven they do not fear being judged for.


This week’s highlighted track, “Bailing On Me”, is a comparatively less aggressive moment on this album. The vocal delivery feels sweet and the instrumentation leaves room to build and breathe with the listener.


6) Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)


Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “The Ballad of Matt & Mica” is the album’s closer. It brings back several musical motifs from the project and crescendos to punctuate this release.


5) Billie Eilish – “HIT ME HARD AND SOFT” (2024)

With the success of her EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” and albums, “When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?” and “Happier Than Ever” the singer became known for her more melancholy tracks. With a knack for writing about the sadness that comes with growing up, Elish was enlisted to write one of the most emotionally hard-hitting songs for the soundtrack of “Barbie” (2023), which earned the singer her second Oscar.
The highlighted track, “CHIHIRO” gets its title from the movie “Spirited Away” (2001). A move known for its gentle atmosphere and intense emotional payoff, this song is no different.


4) Bluhm – “Midnight Hill” (2024)


Detroit dream pop duo Bluhm released their second LP in August after their debut album from last year. According to Bandcamp, they describe their genre as “music for lovers and leavers”, infusing their sound with folk, indie, and pop.


On this album, Bluhm’s vocal duets rise along with the synth-embellished melodies, creating an emanating feeling of nostalgia for the future. Their fantastical pop reminiscence shows a vulnerability, finding solace in sharing hopes and fears.


The highlighted track of this week, “Under the Glow of Your Moon” has a moody opening with sparse tambourines and withholding vocals.


3) Hippo Campus – “Flood” (2024)


Hailing from St. Paul, Minnesota, bedroom pop band Hippo Campus is back with the release of their 4th full-length album, “Flood”.

With themes of vulnerability across the record, the group aimed to capture a universal feeling that everyone can relate to. This new set of songs demonstrates what can be made when you have a tight-knit group that has been growing together both musically and personally, strengthening their bond with their art and their fans.
The highlighted track, “Forget It” has a quicker tempo than much of this album, marking it as a standout in this batch of songs.


2) Suki Waterhouse – Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” (2024)

This week’s highlighted track, “Lullaby”, lives up to the name in its gentle overtones and drawn-out vocals.


1)beabadoobee – “This Is How Tomorrow Moves” (2024)


British singer/songwriter beabadoobee comes from the Philippines and takes inspiration from Pinoy vocalists as well as indie rock artists like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Alex G. The singer first gained notoriety when placed on a list with other rising acts, like Billie Eilish, and led to beabadoobee touring with Clairo to support her Immunity tour.


Her song, “Coffee” was sampled for a TikTok song, “Death Bed” by Powfu, which is when the singer really made her way into the public spotlight. This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.

The singles “Facts” and “U Should Not Be Doing That” became instant fan favorites to excite listeners for their upcoming tour. They also sparked some controversy with the music video of the song “Jerkin” which featured nudity and obscene language, something Amyl and the Sniffers have proven they do not fear being judged for.


This week’s highlighted track, “Bailing On Me”, is a comparatively less aggressive moment on this album. The vocal delivery feels sweet and the instrumentation leaves room to build and breathe with the listener.


6) Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)


Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.


Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.


The highlighted track, “The Ballad of Matt & Mica” is the album’s closer. It brings back several musical motifs from the project and crescendos to punctuate this release.


5) Billie Eilish – “HIT ME HARD AND SOFT” (2024)


Billie Eilish exploded onto the indie-pop scene back in 2015 with the release of her first single, “Ocean Eyes”. The track was the public’s first taste of what would become the hitmaking duo, Billie Eilish’s vocals and songwriting paired up with the production of her brother, FINNEAS.
With the success of her EP, “Don’t Smile at Me” and albums, “When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?” and “Happier Than Ever” the singer became known for her more melancholy tracks. With a knack for writing about the sadness that comes with growing up, Elish was enlisted to write one of the most emotionally hard-hitting songs for the soundtrack of “Barbie” (2023), which earned the singer her second Oscar.
The highlighted track, “CHIHIRO” gets its title from the movie “Spirited Away” (2001). A move known for its gentle atmosphere and intense emotional payoff, this song is no different.


4) Bluhm – “Midnight Hill” (2024)


Detroit dream pop duo Bluhm released their second LP in August after their debut album from last year. According to Bandcamp, they describe their genre as “music for lovers and leavers”, infusing their sound with folk, indie, and pop.


On this album, Bluhm’s vocal duets rise along with the synth-embellished melodies, creating an emanating feeling of nostalgia for the future. Their fantastical pop reminiscence shows a vulnerability, finding solace in sharing hopes and fears.


The highlighted track of this week, “Under the Glow of Your Moon” has a moody opening with sparse tambourines and withholding vocals.


3) Hippo Campus – “Flood” (2024)


Hailing from St. Paul, Minnesota, bedroom pop band Hippo Campus is back with the release of their 4th full-length album, “Flood”. On this album the band attempts to step away from any preconceived notions of how their music ‘should’ sound, instead deciding to start creating this album from a clean slate.
With themes of vulnerability across the record, the group aimed to capture a universal feeling that everyone can relate to. This new set of songs demonstrates what can be made when you have a tight-knit group that has been growing together both musically and personally, strengthening their bond with their art and their fans.
The highlighted track, “Forget It” has a quicker tempo than much of this album, marking it as a standout in this batch of songs.


2) Suki Waterhouse – Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” (2024)


Starting out as a model and actress, Suki Waterhouse began releasing music in 2016 with her single, “Brutally”. Some of the works Waterhouse is most recognizable for are her roles in “Love, Rosie”, “Detective Pikachu”, and “Daisy Jones & the Six”.

This week’s highlighted track, “Lullaby”, lives up to the name in its gentle overtones and drawn-out vocals.


1)beabadoobee – “This Is How Tomorrow Moves” (2024)


British singer/songwriter beabadoobee comes from the Philippines and takes inspiration from Pinoy vocalists as well as indie rock artists like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Alex G. The singer first gained notoriety when placed on a list with other rising acts, like Billie Eilish, and led to beabadoobee touring with Clairo to support her Immunity tour.


Her song, “Coffee” was sampled for a TikTok song, “Death Bed” by Powfu, which is when the singer really made her way into the public spotlight. This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.
