Category is: Gilded Glamour. Anna Wintour has revealed the theme for this year’s Met Gala, and if you’re a celeb out there planning on rocking up in trackies and trainers; think again.
Glitz, glam and all things golden are on the agenda for fashion’s swankiest night of the year, taking place the first Monday in May. Titled Gilded Glamour, this year’s annual Met fashion exhibition is the second instalment of a two-part showcase celebrating American fashion (the first, In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, opened last September).
Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Lin-Manuel Miranda are set to be the night’s celebrity co-chairs, joined by Tom Ford, Anna Wintour and Instagram’s Adam Mosseri, who will be honorary chairs.
Let’s place some bets, shall we? Katy Perry in Moschino’s golden harp dress, perhaps? How about another Beyoncè Schiaparelli moment? Or better yet, could we see Rihanna make her first post-birth red carpet appearance in some Tom Ford-era Gucci? A girl can dream…
