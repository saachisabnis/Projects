Sam Fender, Fontaines D.C., Blossoms and Kasabian are all on the wish lists of fans 
With news today (August 27) that Oasis have reformed, speculation has turned to who could support the band during their huge run of UK and Ireland dates next summer.
After reports that the Britpop giants would be returning in recent weeks, anticipation reached fever pitch this weekend when Liam Gallagher used his Reading Festival 2024 headline set on Sunday (August 25) to tease an announcement. The social media accounts of Oasis and brother Noel soon shared the same teaser, telling fans that news would be coming at 8am today.
The ‘OASIS LIVE 25’ tour will see the band deliver 14 stadium dates between Cardiff, Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin – and there are additional “plans” underway for the tour to “go to other continents outside of Europe later next year”, although no further details have been announced yet.
Tickets go on sale from 9am BST (8am IST) on Saturday August 31 and will be available here for UK shows, and here for the Irish dates.
Now, fans and artists are speculating who might be supporting the band on tour.
Over the weekend, during their headline slot at Wythenshawe Park, Blossoms shared the same teaser on their big concert screens as Liam and Noel, leading many to suspect that the Stockport band will be one of the support acts on tour with the band next summer. The band have also supported Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds previously.
Likewise, Kasabian’s Serge Pizzorno was spotted with Liam backstage at Reading last weekend, ahead of the latter’s headline slot at the festival.
Original Oasis guitarist Paul Arthurs, aka Bonehead, uploaded a photo of Serge backstage at the gig. This was posted around the same time as Liam and Noel teased their tour announcement, leading fans to think Kasabian could also be a support slot possibility.
Likewise, Manic Street Preachers – who supported Oasis during their iconic Knebworth 1995 shows – teased new material yesterday (August 26), sharing a clip of new music on their social media.
The band captioned the post with the words, “So much for the Decline & Fall’. With new material on the way and likely to be toured next year, the Manics could be another possibility for a support slot.

Meanwhile, fans on social media have been sharing their thoughts on who should support the band next summer, with Fontaines D.C. and Courtneers being two fan favourites for the slot.
A fake gig poster also went viral over the weekend showing some other possible support slot options – including LCD Soundsystem – that proved popular with fans.
Other bands – including ones who played alongside Oasis in their earliest days – are wondering if they might be asked along next summer, while the likes of Lottery Winners have reported that their phone “hasn’t stopped” ringing all day with people asking if they could be opening.
CMAT, meanwhile, wrote on X/Twitter: “Hear me out- cmat band for the oasis support.” You can see a selection of posts below.
IF this were true it has the potential to be a massive day out but wont be. The place will be half empty until Oasis come on and the support always lack the same sound quality and staging of the main act. Surely it can't cost that more given the amount they make from these gigs. https://t.co/d2BFPHEz69

After this morning’s big @oasis tour announcement…
We were wondering if Noel and Liam might return the favour and get us that support slot at Wembley?
What do you say?! pic.twitter.com/UiJf6yvZO9

The AMOUNT of people asking if we’re supporting Oasis today is MAD. 
Literally my phone hasn’t stopped all day. Glad that people think we’re at that level.
We’re not (yet), but we’d be up for a little opening slot @SJMConcerts… 😂

Some fans think the support slot could be full of nostalgia acts from the Britpop era – and there are some mixed feelings about this.
Fantasy Oasis support acts for next year
I am going

— Mark Nelson (@marknelsoncomic) August 26, 2024
Oasis coming back has clearly made a lot of people happy, which is nice. But if it means a resurgence or supporting gigs for Ocean Colour Scene, then it needs to be banned
— G U Y S L E Y (@Guysley) August 26, 2024
Richard Ashcroft has to be there.
— AberpudlianKev (@AberpudlianKev1) August 25, 2024
Many fans, conversely, would prefer a mix of newer acts alongside heritage acts. Calls for the likes of High Vis, Sam Fender and The Reytons are many:
Blossoms, Johnny Marr, Lottery Winners

For me it’s gotta be some new bands that are following in there footsteps preferably Manc based, Lathums, K’s etc. With maybe a legend like the Manics alongside them

Yo @oasis @liamgallagher @NoelGallagher get @BobbyVylan as support and obviously @mikeskinnerltd
— Be here now enjoyer (@yo_mikey_) August 27, 2024
Think Kasabian, the Black Keys and a couple of newer bands i.e. Pastel, The K’s, would love Richard Ashcroft and OCS

Personally i’d have Fontaines, Johnny Marr and another newer band maybe the K’s, The Lathums or anyone like that would be a shout

Blossoms, Fender, kasabian, black keys
— Bailey Vernon (@BaileyVernon02) August 25, 2024
There are some fans meanwhile who don’t want the likes of Kasabian or Blossoms to play, while a few also would like to see Oasis’ Britpop rivals Blur make an appearance.
all i want in life is for kasabian to not support oasis but i just know it’s inevitable
— zak▯ (@TOOR34L) August 26, 2024
Am I the only one who’s baffled that blossoms are even being considered as a support act for a potential oasis return??

As it stands, Oasis’ current tour schedule leaves the band free to headline Glastonbury 2025 – which takes place the week before their tour kicks off, from Wednesday June 25 to Sunday June 29. Other acts rumoured to top the bill currently include Eminem, Rihanna, Sam Fender, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.
Bookies are speculating that the Gallagher brothers could take to Glasto as headliners next summer, with OLBG reporting that the band currently have odds of 15/8 to headline the Pyramid Stage.
But some fans think that Oasis’ official announcement this morning quashes any rumours of a Glastonbury appearance with the fact it said the dates “will be the band’s exclusive European appearances” – and there being no mention of Glastonbury. Additionally, reports in The Guardian and Somerset Live also report that the band won’t be headlining the festival next year.

The band have not yet revealed who’ll complete the line-up alongside Liam and Noel, but this week saw newspaper reports claim that “no other original Oasis member is expected to join the reunion” and that “the members of Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds will step in for the concerts”.
News of the highly-anticipated tour – reportedly set to make a colossal £400million – comes ahead of the band releasing a 30th anniversary reissue of their seminal 1994 debut album ‘Definitely Maybe’ on Friday (August 30).
Liam has recently been playing the record in its entirety on a celebratory solo tour throughout this summer, including his bill-topping sets at Reading & Leeds last weekend.
At the southern edition of the twin site festival, the singer dedicated ‘Half The World Away’ (a classic song sung by his brother) to “Noel fucking Gallagher”. He further stoked rumours of a reunion when he played the same track during his Leeds gig, and told the audience: “It is very interesting innit? It is a very interesting situation we’ve found ourselves in.”
