A longer Hiro Murai project has been a long time coming. The director, who is behind most episodes of FX’s Atlanta and Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” music video, has a résumé packed with acclaimed shortform projects. Per Deadline, he’s finally making his feature directorial debut with an original samurai film called Bushido, financed and produced by A24. (Looks like the consensus is that Guava Island, his 56-minute Rihanna and Donald Glover pic from 2019, is best classified as a short film). The Standoff at Sparrow Creek writer-director Henry Dunham will write the script. While plot details are yet to be officially confirmed, we can reportedly expect to see high-stakes action in feudal Japan. Murai and Dunham will produce the film alongside Square Peg’s Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen and 2AM’s Julia Oh, Christine D’Souza Gelb, and David Hinojosa. There’s no release date yet, but it sounds like things are coming together behind the scenes. Go, Bushido, go.
