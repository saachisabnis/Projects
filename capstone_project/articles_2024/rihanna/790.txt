Rihanna stepped out in Barbados for the Crop Over festival, looking iconic in a bejeweled outfit with a matching headpiece and gorgeous wings. According to TMZ, this is the first time she's been at Crop Over since 2019, so this is a major moment!
In the past, Rihanna has worked on her Crop Over looks with Lauren Austin Designs (tbd on if she designed this year's look, but based on an initial Instagram sleuth, seems like it!)
"I enjoy working with Rihanna because she constantly challenges the norm in the fashion world, pushes the boundaries, and is not afraid to break the rules," Lauren told Nylon back in 2018. "She does not care about what others think and she does and wears what she wants. She is an amazing person—very easygoing, fun, and friendly.
"I was a little nervous at first because I was not sure what she thought about my work," she added. "But once I met her, she made me feel very at ease. I was very excited and happy with my work. She told me how much she loved my work. She made me very comfortable, and I haven’t felt nervous since."
Just FYI, Rihanna spoke about her love for Barbados to Interview back in April, saying "Barbados will always be home. One hundred percent. I’m still a citizen after all these years."
Love to see her back at Crop Over!
