Taylor Swift knows all too well the end of the Eras Tour is around the corner, and she’s commemorating the “wondrous” experience with some new behind-the-scenes merch for diehard Swifties.
The Grammy winner, 34, on Tuesday announced The Official Eras Tour Book and a new edition of “The Tortured Poets Department,” both coming sold exclusively at Target shelves for Black Friday.
“We’ll be kicking off the final leg of The Eras Tour this week, which is hard to comprehend,” Swift captioned a video ad. “This tour has been the most wondrous experience and I knew I wanted to commemorate the memories we made together in a special way. Well, two ways actually.”
Swift said that beginning Nov. 29, Target will be selling “The Official Eras Tour Book,” which is “filled with my own personal reflections, never-before-seen behind the scenes photos, all the magical memories every single night” as well as a vinyl and CD edition of “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.”
The “Guilty as Sin?” singer added that she’ll soon provide information for fans outside the U.S.
During the Eras Tour’s 100th show in mid-June, Swift announced that the landmark sensation — the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion — would officially end on Dec. 8, the last of three consecutive shows in Vancouver, British Columbia.
“This is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December,” she told the crowd at Liverpool’s Anfield Stadium at the time.
On Dec. 8, 2023, AP reported that the Eras Tour had grossed $1.04 billion, a historic number for tours both worldwide and in North America, less than two months after Swift herself was officially crowned a billionaire.
Earlier this month, Forbes reported that Swift’s updated net worth pushed her ahead of Rihanna as the richest female musician.
