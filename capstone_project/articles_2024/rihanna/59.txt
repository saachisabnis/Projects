When the door of one luxury house closes, another opens. On December 12, it was announced that British designer Louise Trotter would be the new Creative Director of Bottega Veneta, following her departure from French brand Carven. “I am deeply honored to join Bottega Veneta as Creative Director,” Trotter shares. “The House’s storied legacy of artistry and innovation is truly inspiring, and I am excited to contribute to its future and celebrate its timeless vision.”
Established in 1966, the Italian luxury brand is well-known for their 'Intrecciato' woven leather designs, favored by everyone from Jacob Elordi to Rihanna. Since 2021, the brand has been under the creative direction of French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy. With Trotter replacing Blazy at the end of January 2025, it will be exciting to see the brand through a new perspective.
