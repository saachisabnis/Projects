Gwen Stefani has been slammed over her 'horrifying' treatment of a 'terrified' kitten on The Voice this week.
The No Doubt singer, 54, received widespread backlash when she brought her tiny new rescue kitten out on stage on Monday night's season 26 premiere - before holding it up in the air as she addressed the studio audience.
Singer Sydney Sterlace wowed the judges with a rendition of Olivia Rodrigo's Drivers License - with Stefani being handed her cat afterward to convince Sydney to pick her as a mentor.
She said: 'You know Sydney... I had this little thing happen to me.
'This little creature came up to my porch and was like barely alive and was like "I love you, you're my new cat" but I don't have a name!

Gwen Stefani has been slammed over her 'horrifying' treatment of a 'terrified' kitten on The Voice this week
'Then I thought maybe I can name it Sydney.
She then raised her voice as the kitten meowed and said: 'This cat's name is Sydney!'
When Stefani was picked by Sydney, she screamed 'oh my god!' while holding the wriggling kitten - who appeared to be around six weeks old - before holding the animal in the air as she hugged her new mentee.Â 
She then walked offstage holding the kitten in the air with both hands - with her behavior quickly branded 'disturbing', 'horrifying' and 'unacceptable.'
One fan wrote: 'Please never let Gwen near an animal again. They way she kept hoisting that tiny, scared kitten sky high above her head was horrifying.'
Another penned: 'love you to bits, but please never do that to such a young animal again. The noise, the way you held it like it was a stuffed animal dangling from your fingers, all of it would be traumatizing for such a very young kitten.'
Others wrote: 'Please donâ€™t bring baby animals on and swing them around for entertainment. So sad to see that scared kitten'
'I love you, Gwen, and so enjoy you on The Voice, but I wish I could help you understand how terrified that kitten was. It wasn't taken from its mother that long ago and then to be out in front of all the people and noise, it isn't having a great start in life.'

DailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Gwen Stefani and The Voice comment.Â 
Stefani's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale recently spoke about his exÂ following their divorce in 2016 after nearly 13 years of marriage.
He candidly discussed his 'shame' over the separation.
'I never thought I'd ever get divorced, so there's a simple shame in my life,' the rockstar began.
'I feel bad for my kids,' he continued. 'I wish I could have found a way to not have that in their lives. It wasn't fun for me to come from a broken home.'
He added: 'It can be quite debilitating for kids. The overriding thing is you donâ€™t want to let your kids down.'
Gavin and Gwen romantically crashed into each other at the end of the 1990s and tied the knot in 2002.
After welcoming three sons, and nearly 13 years of marriage, the superstar couple announced their separation, shocking fans. The couple officially divorced in 2016.
Gwen has since found love with Blake Shelton, whom she married in 2021.
