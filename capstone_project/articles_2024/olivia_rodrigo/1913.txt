Unlike Us, Olivia Rodrigo makes riding the subway look surprisingly good.
Rodrigo, 21, took to Instagram on Tuesday, December 3, to show off a fashion-forward ’fit while posing on her pop-up subway experience in New York City. For her station takeover — in celebration of her LinkBuds partnership with Sony Electronics — Rodrigo wore a halter minidress from Dana Foley with a playful polka-dot print.
This isn’t the first time Rodrigo has rocked the pattern. In April, she looked fierce in a red-and-white spotted dress while posing against a dressing room. Similar to her latest look, the frock featured a plunging top that tied together at the top and a flirty, fitted silhouette.
At the time, she wore her hair in two braids and accessorized with oversized black round sunglasses.
But why wear one statement piece when you can have several? Rodrigo had fun mixing motifs with a furry Kurt Geiger cheetah print purse (a.k.a one of 2024’s biggest trends). She added more It factor to her look with cherry red nails and patent leather Stuart Weitzman Mary Janes.
Rodrigo’s glam was just as polished. The singer’s makeup included her signature winged eyeliner and a crimson red lip. She parted her brunette locks down the center and styled her mane in relaxed waves.

At the experience, fans enjoyed posing on the subway car, which was decorated with her song titles as subway stops, shopping her merch and more. The station’s brick wall was emblazoned with “Obsessed” mosaics, referencing her hit and purple butterflies.
“❤️🚊,” Rodrigo captioned the post. Fans complimented the singer’s getup in the comments section.
“New York queen 😍,” one wrote. Another added, “Omg she’s so American!!” While a third commented: “My fave metro card model 😍.”
