Pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo gave her fans a fright when she took a tumble through a stage hole during her concert.
The 21-year-old chart-topper was belting out tunes to about 14,000 fans at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena on Monday night (October 14) as part of her Guts World Tour when the mishap occurred. In the middle of her energetic performance, Olivia vanished from sight, plunging through an opening on stage, prompting shocked gasps from her audience.
But in true star fashion, she bounced back with a grin, exclaiming: "Oh my God, that was fun! I'm OK."

Shrugging off the fall, the Good 4 U singer quipped: "Wow. Sometimes, there's just a hole in the stage."
The High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star then cheekily asked: "That's alright! Alright, where was I?"
Later that night, Olivia hopped onto TikTok to post a video of her unexpected plunge, playing along with the app's "subtle foreshadowing" trend. This involves editing a clip so the end is sneakily inserted into the middle, often hinting at a comical or dramatic outcome.
Post-fall, some of Olivia's followers were buzzing with the idea that she might spin this event into creative gold for her next hit or album.
One fan speculated on TikTok: "Not me thinking 'subtle foreshadowing' could be a next song or a next album (sic)."
Another suggested: "Next song? Possibly. Next album? No. It has to be four letters so probably... Fall (sic)."
Olivia's stage blunder happened during her last Melbourne performance, before she moves on to Sydney for a series of shows at the Qudos Bank Arena over the coming weeks.
Earlier this month, Olivia gave a stellar performance to a packed audience at Bocaue's Philippine Arena - marking her first concert in the Philippines - and generously donated all the proceeds to Jhpiego, a women's health charity.
