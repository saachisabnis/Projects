Big stars and guests showed up to Coachella 2024 including Will Smith. Will Smith joined J Balvin on stage and performed his hit, “Men In Black.” Smith wore his signature black Ray-Bans and had the crowd signing along.
Gwen Stefani reunited with “No Doubt” and proved why she is a legend. Olivia Rodrigo joined Stefani on stage in an “I LOVE ND” T-shirt in honor of the band’s return to the stage.
People were also excited to see performances by Shakira, Tyler the Creator, Chloe and Doja Cat, who had four wardrobe changes.
The other thing people were excited to see that had nothing to do with a performance was Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, seen walking around enjoying the bands.
