Fans are sharing their reactions online to the 2025 rock, metal and alternative Grammy nominations.
The Grammy Awards are typically a controversial topic within the rock and metal world for a variety of reasons, from the lack of airing the categories during the live ceremony to the questionable artist selections that are typically chosen.
The metal category usually has a fair representation of metal artists, but rock and alternative are where it becomes a bit more of a head-scratcher moment.
It seems as though there is a solid representation of rock and metal based on this year's nominees, which include Metallica, Spiritbox, Gojira, Pearl Jam, The Black Crowes, The Rolling Stones, Knocked Loose featuring Poppy, Green Day, The Black Keys, Cage the Elephant and some others.
