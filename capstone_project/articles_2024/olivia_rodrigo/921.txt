(KLFY) — Acadiana musicians brought home some hardware from the 66th annual Grammy Awards presented Sunday night.
Lainey Wilson continued her domination of awards season, winning the Grammy for Best Country Album for “Bell Bottom Country.” The 31-year-old singer took home five awards at the 57th Annual CMA Awards in November, the most of any artist, including Entertainer of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year.
 Grammys are Taylor Swift’s world while women like Cyrus, Mitchell and Chapman shine 
Two local acts received Grammys in the Best Regional Roots Music Album category, which ended in a tie. “New Beginnings” by Buckwheat Zydeco Jr. & The Legendary Ils Sont Partis Band and “Live: Orpheum Theater Nola” by Lost Bayou Ramblers & Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra were each handed the famous Grammaphone-shaped statuette.
Phoebe Bridgers had the most wins, with four trophies (three with her band, boygenius). SZA, boygenius, Killer Mike, Victoria Monét and songs from the “Barbie” soundtrack followed, with three wins apiece. Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift had two, but Swift also broke a record, becoming the first artist to earn four album of the year prizes.
