If you spotted a massive star, would you approach them and ask for a photo or autograph? I think you have to, especially if you're a fan of their work. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create an amazing memory.
I would bet there were plenty of selfies snapped when the global pop sensation, recognized as Time Magazine's Entertainer of the Year in 2021, showed up for lunch. The server got a picture, and the Minnesota Cafe thanked the singer for her decision to support their small, local establishment.
French Meadow Café & Bluestem Bar can be found at 2610 Lyndale Ave S in Minneapolis. It began as a bakery almost 40 years ago, pioneering organic certification in the United States in 1985 and focusing on yeast-free bread.
The Uptown Minneapolis cafe, established in the early 1990s, is known for its natural, local, and organic cuisine, accommodating various dietary preferences like vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan.
In 2013, the establishment expanded to include the Bluestem Bar, providing full table service, sustainable wines, local beers on tap, and a private dining space.
Can you imagine the excitement everyone in the café must have felt when one of the biggest stars on the planet walked through the doors and sat down for lunch?
Olivia Rodrigo visited the Twin Cities during her Guts Tour and stopped by to enjoy lunch. The 21-year-old pop star is one of the biggest names in music.
She has won three Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. She has been named Time's Entertainer of the Year and Billboard's Woman of the Year.
