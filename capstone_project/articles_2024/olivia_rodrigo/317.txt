Taylor Swift was the top winner at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards, which was broadcast on Fox on Thursday (Dec. 12). Swift’s 10 new trophies bring her career win total to 49, which is more than any other artist in BBMA history. She had been tied for that distinction with Drake, with 39 wins each. (Drake won three awards this year, bringing his total to 42.)

	This is the second year in a row that Swift has won 10 BBMAs. 2023 and 2024 are her two years with the most wins. Before these two years, her personal best was eight wins, in both 2013 and 2015. Swift collected her first three BBMAs in 2011.

	Swift won Top Artist for the record-setting fourth time, having previously won in 2013, 2015 and 2023. She is the first four-time winner in this category, breaking out of a tie with Drake at three wins each. Moreover, she’s the first artist to win back-to-back awards in this category since Destiny’s Child in 2000 and 2001.

	Swift won Top Female Artist for the record-extending sixth time, having previously won in 2013, 2015, 2018, 2021 and 2023. She has won in three of the last four years, missing out in this period only in 2022, when Olivia Rodrigo won.

	She won Top Billboard 200 Artist for the record-extending seventh time, having previously won in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

She previously won for Red in 2013 and 1989 in 2015. All three of these albums received Grammy nominations for album of the year (1989 won). We’ll learn TTPD’s fate on Feb. 2.

	Swift won Top Hot 100 Artist for the second time, having previously won in 2015. She won four other awards for the second time, having previously won them last year.

	Proving that even for Taylor Swift, there are still new worlds to conquer, she won Top Streaming Songs Artist for the first time.

	The tracking period for the 2024 Billboard Music Awards was Oct. 13, 2023, through Oct. 10, 2024, which corresponds to Billboard chart dates from Oct. 28, 2023, through Oct. 19, 2024.
