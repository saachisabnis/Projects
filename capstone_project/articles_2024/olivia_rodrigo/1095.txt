Not Liv’s backup dancer chasing her around the stage trying to fix it. 😅
Wardrobe malfunctions definitely come with the territory when you’re doing a giant stadium tour, and Olivia Rodrigo just had a pretty major one! As in, her top legit undid itself in the back and almost fell off during her performance of “Love Is Embarrassing.” And honestly, she handled it like a pro and did. not. miss. a. beat.
The moment was (obviously) caught on camera, and footage shows Olivia realizing her shirt is coming apart while a backup dancer follows her around the stage and attempts to help.
Liv ends up laughing the moment off by saying, “This is fucking embarrassing,” which is truly so on-theme for the song in question.
A reminder that the musician just added nine new international dates to her GUTS Tour, with stops in Bangkok, Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Melbourne, and Sydney. Unfortunately, she had to cancel several Manchester shows in early May due to technical issues at the arena. 
“I’ve been having such a great time in Europe so far and I’m sooooo disappointed that we’re unable to perform in Manchester due to ongoing venue-related technical issues,” Olivia told fans via her Instagram Story. “We’re doing our best to reschedule the show. You can hold onto your tickets for further info or request a refund at your point of purchase. More info will be sent directly to ticket holders. I’m so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon.”
