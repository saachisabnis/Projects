Performing a world tour is not for the weak. Just ask Olivia Rodrigo, who fell through a hole in the stage while performing in Melbourne, Australia, and had to be sent to the hospital after the show. Don’t worry, she’s fine. In fact, she would even say she’s more than fine following the experience.
Jimmy Fallon asked Rodrigo about the incident during her appearance on The Tonight Show on October 29, and even showed a video of the fall in question. Rodrigo can be seen running across the stage before accidentally stumbling into the open trap door. “Oh my God, that was fun! I’m okay,” she assures the audience in the video. “Sometimes, there’s just a hole in the stage,” she laughs as she gets up.
Reacting to the clip, Rodrigo admitted that the fall was “pretty scary,” and she went to the hospital just to confirm that she didn’t have a concussion. “It was actually kind of a beautiful thing and I’m really happy it happened in hindsight,” she told Fallon, explaining that she’d been thinking about her own Filipino heritage after her tour stop in the Philippines before Australia. “Randomly, the nurse was a Filipino man with the same name as my grandpa who just passed away a few months ago. I was like, Wow, that was him looking out for me and making sure I didn’t get hurt. I’m really happy it happened,” she said.
During the interview, Olivia Rodrigo also shared a few other highlights from the tour, including being questioned by the Canadian police—who had confused her with a woman named Olivia Rodriguez. “Jimmy, I was pissed!” Rodrigo said.
Clearly, it was an eventful few months.
