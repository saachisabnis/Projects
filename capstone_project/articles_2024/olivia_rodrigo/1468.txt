MELBOURNE, Australia (Gray News) - Pop star Olivia Rodrigo experienced an onstage mishap during a recent performance in Australia while on her world tour.
Rodrigo, 21, was running across the stage when she fell into an opening in the floor in Melbourne on Monday.
The singer can be heard telling the crowd “Oh my God, that was fun ... I’m OK!” while she pulled herself back up onto the stage.
“Sometimes there’s just a hole in the stage,” Rodrigo added. “That’s alright.”
Rodrigo quickly brushed off the incident early in the show and ended up finishing the concert, People reported.
The 21-year-old has a few more shows left on the Australian part of her Guts World Tour before taking a break over the holidays.
The tour will resume in March 2025 with scheduled stops in Argentina and Brazil.
