Fans can't get enough of the talented Gracie Abrams, especially since she recently released her anxiously awaited new single, "Risk," as well as its official music video! And with the success of "Risk," iHeartRadio has named Gracie our latest On The Verge artist. 
"Risk" is a bubbly high-energy ballad where Gracie confesses that she's ready to take a "Risk" with a new crush. The music video perfectly matches the song's energy as it takes place on a "quiet, dark suburban street," where Gracie chases after her crush and takes us through an "exhilarating night" of every emotion she's feeling while contemplating what to do with her latest love. 
"Risk" is the lead single from Gracieâ€™s highly anticipated sophomore album, The Secret of Us, which she recently announced will be out on June 21st. The Secret of Us comes nearly a year after her debut album, Good Riddance, which was released in February of 2023. 
Good Riddance earned Gracie her first-ever Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.
Gracie has had quite the run in her career thus far. In 2021 and 2022, she headlined two separate tours, and on top of touring in 2022, she also earned a spot as an opener for Olivia Rodrigo on her Sour Tour. 
Most recently, Gracie was also an opener for several dates during Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and will continue opening for Swift once her tour is back in North America!
