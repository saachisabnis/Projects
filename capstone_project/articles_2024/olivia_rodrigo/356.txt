Celine Dion speaks onstage during the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.
When Taylor Swift made Grammy Award history Sunday night with her fourth Album of the Year award, folks thought she snubbed presenter Celine Dion. Dion's rare appearance amid her rare health condition fueled the fire even more that Swift didn't acknowledge her when she accepted the trophy. On X (formerly Twitter), people were dragging Swift for the alleged snub. One person wrote: "The irony that Celine Dion took a moment to acknowledge the legends Diana Ross & Sting who presented her the same award 27 YEARS AGO… this was not a good look Taylor, I’m sorry." Another said: "not trying to be hater but being handed a Grammy by Celine Dion in her very triumphant first public appearance in a long time and barely making eye contact insane." A third said: "Taylor not even acknowledging Celine Dion is not sitting right with my spirit. Girl, that is CELINE DION." Even late-night host Jimmy Kimmel addressed the alleged snub, saying Swift also made history by "becoming the first white woman to ignore Celine Dion."
However, sources told Page Six that the "All by Myself" singer was unbothered by it. Instead, the Canadian superstar, who has been battling Stiff-Person syndrome, just wanted to show everyone that she’s back. "She wanted to show everyone that she’s doing alright," the insider said. Of the painful neurological disorder, the source said Dion has good days and bad days, "but it’s not a death sentence."

A few days prior to her surprise Grammys appearance, Dion announced the upcoming release of her new documentary, I Am: Céline Dion," set to stream on Amazon Prime Video. She wrote in her Instagram caption: "This last couple of years has been such a challenge for me, the journey from discovering my condition to learning how to live with and manage it, but not to let it define me. As the road to resuming my performing career continues, I have realized how much I have missed it, of being able to see my fans. During this absence, I decided I wanted to document this part of my life, to try to raise awareness of this little-known condition, to help others who share this diagnosis." A premiere date has not yet been revealed.

Billie Eilish is up for six awards this year. Her Barbie track, “What Was I Made For?” is up for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, Best Music Video, and Best Song Written for Visual Media. The singer-songwriter is also nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the Labrinth collaboration “Never Felt So Alone.” Olivia Rodrigo has six nominations as well: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Guts; Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Vampire”; and Best Rock Song for “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl.” Also for her Barbie soundtrack contribution, Dua Lipa has two nods for her track, “Dance the Night” for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media.
Take a look below at the five best dressed pop artists at the 66th Grammy Awards:
This may be the first and last time the "Shape of You" singer lands on our best-dressed list. Sheeran outdid himself with this camouflage-print outfit. The English singer-songwriter is nominated for Best Pop Vocal album for his '- (Subtract)' album. Even if he doesn't win against the other nominees, he can go home satisfied that he looked his best at the red carpet!
We hope the "Houdini" singer is "here for long," because we are loving her glittering, glamorous gown. Rocking her deep red locks, the singer looks like a rockstar in this plunging silver floor-length gown with hip slits by Courrèges. She kept her makeup sun-kissed and natural-looking, bringing out her natural beauty. The English-Albanian singer wore an equally sparkling and extravagant necklace by Tiffany &amp; Co. The necklace is super unique and eye-catching, featuring fish facing the center with  a matching bracelet and cocktail ring.
The "vampire" singer just snatched our soul in this gorgeous white pearl gown. Rodrigo exuded elegance in this vintage Versace gown dotted with delicate red and white beads. She accessorized with earrings and a bold red lip and sharp cat eyeliner. She wore her long brown hair down softly curled and parted to the side.
Doja painted the town red in this glamorous and sexy sheer gown. Turning heads once again on a red carpet, the singer and rapper's very low cut, peach corseted gown showcased all her tattoos. She accessorized the look with crosses on her necklace and earrings as well as thick, rectangular black eyeglasses. There's nothing more that we love than a perfect combination of sexy and beautifully cut gowns that show off all of Doja's assets.
Taylor looks the best we've ever seen her at any event. The "Anti-Hero" singer-songwriter donned this sleeveless white ruched gown by Schiaparelli Couture that is gorgeously corseted in the back. Giving regal fairy queen vibes, the pop icon accessorized the gown with long black gloves, multiple bejeweled necklaces, and an elegant black choker. With her iconic red lip, Swift also wore a sharp cat eye. She wore her light brown hair down with a braid along the side.
Billie Eilish's style is always unique. Most times, we love her looks, whether it's feminine and form-fitting or boyish and boxy. However, this look for the Grammys is not giving the inspiration and spark we live for when it comes to her outfits. The "What Was I Made For" singer-songwriter opted for nerdy comfort. She wore a Barbie varsity jacket with baby pink satin sleeves and details with a white collared undershirt and black tie. Wearing the thin, black metal glasses adds to her laid-back look this evening, but for us, it is so boring.
If this were for any other occasion, we wouldn't be mad about this gilded lioness look Miley Cyrus wears. However, being that it is the Grammys, the "outfit" consisting of mostly golden chains along her body is a bit too revealing and gaudy. With matching metal panties and safety pin accents, the singer wore her hair teased and curled back away from her face, giving a '70s vibe. We would love this look for a performance or music video, but for a red carpet look, we hate it. Thankfully, she changed inside the awards ceremony to a black gown, saving us from looking at this outfit all night.
We're not quite sure what the cookbook author and model was thinking with this outfit, but we can't believe she thought it was good. Wearing this mini dress, Teigen's skirt consisted of a giant pink rose front and center. The opening of the rose is a bit too yonic and comes off as tacky. Even if the rose skirt wasn't there, the mini dress would have been very boring. Instead, she chose this comical outfit and won't be remembered for anything but looking foolish alongside her husband, who looked dapper in a black satin suit.
