Of COURSE the music video is horror themed
Sabrina Carpenter is about to drop her much hyped album Short N Sweet tomorrow, and if that wasn’t enough goodness for you she’s just surprise revealed that the next single Taste will be a link up with none other than Jenna Ortega! I’m gagged, I’m slayed, and the preview for the music video looks like we’re in for another dose of iconic visuals.

There were signs. A visual was posted before the teaser dropped of Sabrina Carpenter with her back to us, and a mystery woman we now know to be Jenna Ortega stood beside her. Fans were theorising it was going to be Olivia Rodrigo because of the history the two have circa Driver’s License release, but it’s a different twist!
Fans are speculating Sabrina Carpenter’s music video for “TASTE” will be inspired by the 1992 cult classic DEATH BECOMES HER.

Whilst I didn’t get major Death Becomes Her vibes from the Taste teaser, I am so excited for whatever Jenna Ortega and Sabrina Carpenter have cooked up for us.
The video preview we can see sees Sabrina grab a knife and head into where Jenna is with a man. Sabrina charges at her with a knife, and it looks like bloody slasher revenge might ensue!
Short N Sweet the album releases tomorrow, with Taste flanking as the third single and the video too. The album also homes the smash hit singles Espresso and Please Please Please, two number ones that have propelled Sabrina Carpenter to household name and main pop girl status. Give it to me now!
