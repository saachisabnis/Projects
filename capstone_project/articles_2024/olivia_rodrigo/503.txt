The chaos at Co-opâ€™s brand new venue Co-op Live in Manchester shows no signs of slowing down with Take That becoming the latest act to cancel performances at the Â£365m arena.
The three-piece band has moved its shows to a rival venue, the AO Arena, after the UKâ€™s biggest indoor area became plagued with â€˜ongoing venue-related technical issues.â€™
In an Instagram post, the Shine singers said: â€˜Given the ongoing technical issues around the opening of Co-op Live we have taken the difficult decision to move our May shows to the AO Arena where we have enjoyed many great nights over the years.
â€˜This is not a decision we have taken lightly, but we wanted to give our fans as much notice as possible.â€™
It comes after Olivia Rodrigo said she was â€˜sooooooo disappointedâ€™ she could not perform her Guts World Tour at the Co-op Live.
Olivia, who made a cameo at Coachella last month, and Take That are not the only ones rescheduling gigs as the Oak View Group confirmed part of the air conditioning system detached and fell.
This was supposed to be the jewel in the Co-opâ€™s crown as the biggest indoor arena in the UK â€“ with Harry Styles investing â€“ but its opening has been plagued by cancellations.
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie was the first to announce the show had been cancelled just hours before Julius Dubose was meant to take the stage.
Furious and confused fans queued outside waiting to see if the event would go ahead until Co-op Live made an official announcement on X.
It wrote: â€˜Due to a venue-related technical issue, tonightâ€™s A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie show will no longer go ahead. We kindly ask fans to leave the area. Tickets holders will receive further information in due course.â€™
The carnage has been absolutely rinsed online with fans comparing it to the infamous Fyre Fest which took place in 2017 and dubbing it the â€˜Co-flopâ€™.
On Thursday, Sacha Lord, appointed by mayor Andy Burnham, as the night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, made his first statement about the issue.
He told the PA News Agency: â€˜As with all event venues, the safety of staff and customers is the highest priority even if that means there are delays.
â€˜We are monitoring the situation closely.â€™
On top of Olivia and Boogie, Peter Kayâ€™s inaugural show was postponed twice and music icons The Black Keys also scrapped their turn at the venue.
Rick Astleyâ€™s turn at the venue saw 4,000 tickets cancelled an hour before his show, which was touted as a â€˜testâ€™ gig for Co-op Live.
â€˜Going very Fyre Festival all this,â€™ joked X user the_paris_angel while Andy Grimshaw tweeted: â€˜Jurassic Park had a smoother openingâ€¦â€™
Rebecca Dunbar added: â€˜Oh myâ€¦ We need a Fyre Festival type documentary about theCo-op Live opening and we need it now!â€™
â€˜The year is 2040 and Co-op Live are still having technical issues,â€™ wrote Iz as Rach said: â€˜Got to be the worst venue and organisation Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€™
In a statement to Metro.co.uk, a spokesperson for Co-op Live said: â€˜We understand the need to reassure fans over future shows.Â We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule.

â€˜Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows. Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.â€™
They explained that during soundcheck, â€˜a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork.Â 
â€˜There was nobody injured.Â Although we believe this to be an isolated incident caused by a factory defect, we were not able to verify that all similar nozzles were free of such defects. 
We know that youâ€™ve been waiting to hear from himâ€¦  A big thanks to Harry Styles for sending us this messageðŸ’™ #harrystyles 
â€˜In conjunction with wider stakeholders, Oak View Group has made the necessary call to ensure the full safety of all visitors to the venue, and to postpone the performance.Â 
â€˜In response, the installer, contractor and third-party inspector will now test each nozzle to confirm they are free of defect.â€™
Fans have pointed out that this is a fancy way of saying part of the AC plummeted from the ceiling during soundcheck.
Artists like Take That, Stevie Nicks, Nicki Minaj, Jonas Brothers, and The Kings of Leon are all due to take the stage later this year.
For Oliviaâ€™s fans there is relief the gig has been cancelled well in advance so they are not left stranded in the city, having paid for travel or parking, as some Boogie fans were.
The Brutal hitmaker shared an update on Instagram, writing: â€˜Iâ€™ve been having such a great time in Europe so far and Iâ€™m sooooo disappointed that weâ€™re unable to perform in Manchester due to on-going venue-related technical issues.
â€˜Weâ€™re doing our best to reschedule the show.â€™
Her Guts tour reached Dublin last night and will resume at Glasgowâ€™s OVO Hydro on May 7 and May 8 before heading to Birmingham and London.
