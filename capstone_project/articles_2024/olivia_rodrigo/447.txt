When I was in college, at Howard University from 2013 to 2017, I was obsessed with purple lipstick. I remember always donning the hue for parties, brunch, happy hour, and everything in between. My friends were equally obsessed with the look—especially if it was matte. It was the color before it suddenly wasn’t anymore. I don’t know what happened, but without warning, we all just stopped wearing the shade. So, when Lancôme unveiled new shades of their L’Absolu Rouge Drama Matte on Tuesday, December 17—with one being purple—I rejoiced.

Called Plum Addiction, the creamy matte shade features a “cool berry” color that lasts up to eight hours. It also features hydrating ingredients like vitamin E. Olivia Rodrigo, who was announced as Lancôme’s newest global ambassador last month, showed off the new color as well as the shade Haute en Pink in her first campaign for the brand—which was also released on Tuesday. In the striking images, Rodrigo is a must-see in bright colors that complement her bright lips. The campaign emphasizes this idea that glamor is back, maximalism is back, and most importantly purple lipstick is so back. With the colors dropping right before Christmas and New Year’s Eve, I can see Plum Addiction dominating the holiday season as well as winter and spring. 
Rodrigo’s new role with Lancôme may have come as a surprise to some, considering the legacy brand has had a mature reputation. However, appointing Rodrigo continues efforts to reach a younger, more Gen Z audience. Plus, Plum Addiction perfectly aligns with Rodrigo’s purple aesthetic. Lancôme even rebranded their Instagram to match Rodrigo’s signature shade. 
In addition to Plum Addiction and Haute en Pink, Lancôme also introduced Exhilarating Brown, Nude Frisson, Nude Frenergy, Espresso Rush, Rouge-Pigalle, French Touch, Rose Energie, Nude Shot, and Red Is Drama on Bloomingdales.com.
