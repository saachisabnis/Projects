Paris Jackson wowed in a sexy black gown, featuring a racy cutout, across her toned midriff, at the Grammys 2024 in Los Angeles, California on Sunday.
For the occasion, the 25-year-old daughter of the late superstar Michael Jackson turned heads in her daring ensemble, designed by Celine, as she strutted down the red carpet in a pair of strappy black pumps.
She completed her edgy look with a pair of dangly hoop earrings and clutch bag, carrying her essentials.
Her expansive ink collection was noticeably covered up for the evening. 
Paris Jackson wowed in a sexy black gown, featuring a racy cutout, across her toned midriff, at the Grammys 2024 in Los Angeles, California on Sunday
Jackson teamed up with makeup brand Cover FX to cover up her expansive ink collection for the night
In order to hide all her tattoos, including the abundant body art adorning her arms and chakras design running down her chest, she teamed up with makeup brand Cover FX, and beauty pros Tyson Fountaine - who hid the inkings on her body - and Paul Blanch, who was responsible for her makeup look for the evening. 
Her makeup artist used the brand's Total Cover Cream Foundation to conceal all 80 of her tats.
'#CoverFX meant business when they said total cover cream foundation would have me covered,' she captioned the footage. 
Ahead of the ceremony, she shared a time-lapse video on Instagram of the process to cover up all her tattoos, which saw Fountaine applying the Cover FX Gripping Primer to her body to ensure that the makeup stuck to the skin. 
To keep the makeup there all night long, Fountaine added a layer of Pressed Mineral Foundation, then finished it off with the High Performance Setting Spray 'to prevent the makeup from transferring and [ensure it] lasted all night'. 
However Paris' decision to conceal her body art sparked a debate among her Instagram followers.  
'I'm confused, Why cover them?! You look amazing as YOU ❤️,' one follower wrote under the video. 
Another suggested: 'This is obviously just to promote how good the product works, guys. And it's a pretty good marketing technique to use a canvas with that much ink. If it can over all that, there's nothing it can't cover on your face, get it?'

Her fans expressed shocked by her choice to hide her tats, with many asking 'why cover them up?' 
Speaking about the shock decision, the singer's glam team explained: 'Paris chose a chic and elegant Celine 2024 dress with cutouts for the Grammys, and we felt it would be more dramatic to cover her tattoos and really let the dress be the center of her look.' 
Others said she looked 'stunning' and 'so beautiful.' 
Over the years, Paris has spoken about using tattoos and piercings to express herself, even though she got 'a lot of them' for no reason. 
Her first tat was an alien on one of her breasts, which she told People was a spontaneous decision. 
'I just wanted it — it's kind of how they all are,' she said of her tat collection. 'I've done a few of my own.' 
The 2024 Grammy Awards will be honoring music's brightest stars in a celebration held at the Crypto.com Arena in downtown on February 4.
Hosted by Trevor Noah, this year's celebration will air live at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and its streaming service Paramount+.

This year SZA tops the nominations with a total of nine nods, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song Of The Year. Taylor Swift follows close behind with six nominations, and will also be competing against SZA in the three aforementioned categories.
The majority of Swift's nominations were for her acclaimed album Midnights and its single Anti-Hero, which earned some of the best reviews of her career.
That track is up for Record of the Year, a category that honors the artists who recorded the song and its producers and engineers, as well as for the Song of the Year category, which honors songwriters. SZA's track Kill Bill has also been nominated in both categories.
Swift has already made history in the Album of the Year category, currently tied for three previous wins with music legends Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder.
However, she is now poised to become the first-ever person to win the category four times if Midnights ends up victorious this year.
Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus are also both up for six awards. Eilish's nominations include Song and Record of the Year for her hit single from the Barbie soundtrack, What Was I Made For?
Cyrus has the chance to win her first ever Grammy this year with her nominations.  
Ahead of the ceremony, she shared a time-lapse video on Instagram of the process to cover up all her tattoos
'#CoverFX meant business when they said total cover cream foundation would have me covered,' she captioned the footage
'I'm confused, Why cover them?! You look amazing as YOU ❤️,' one follower wrote under the video
Her track Flowers is up for Record and Song of the Year, while her album Endless Summer Vacation has been nominated for Album of the Year.
Olivia Rodrigo is another major name in competition for a trophy. 
Olivia - who has already won three Grammys - has been nominated for six awards this year, including Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, and Song Of The Year. 
Other major nominees include jazz crossover artist Jon Batiste, the trio Boygenius (made up of Phoebe Bridges, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker), Lana Del Rey, Janelle Monáe and Victoria Monét, who was nominated for Best New Artist and multiple awards for her album Jaguar II and its singles. 
In addition to the big names celebrating career achievements, a host of celebrities are set to be presenting at the show.
Christina Aguilera, Lenny Kravitz, Lionel Richie, Mark Ronson, Maluma, Meryl Steep, Samara Joy, Taylor Tomlinson, and Oprah Winfrey have all been announced as presenters.
Audience members and viewers alike will also be treated to an array of incredible performances, with Billie Eilish, Billy Joel, Burna Boy, Dua Lipa, Luke Combs, Olivia Rodrigo, SZA, Travis Scott, and U2 slated to perform.
Folk music icon Joni Mitchell will also be performing for the first time ever at the Grammy awards this year. She too is up for an award for Best Folk Album Category for Joni Mitchel AT Newport [Live].
