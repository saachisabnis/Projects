Jonas Brothers, Reneé Rapp and Zedd are among the acts booked for the 2024 NCAA March Madness Music Festival, scheduled for April 5-7 at Hance Park in Phoenix, Arizona.
The free concert event will provide the soundtrack to the Final Four of the Division I men’s basketball tournament. The event kicks off April 5 with Zedd headlining the AT&T Block Party. Reneé will also perform that day, as will singer/songwriter Remi Wolf, who’s opening for Olivia Rodrigo this summer in Europe.
On April 6, Jonas Brothers will headline the Coke Studio LIVE event. April 7 is reserved for rock acts Mumford & Sons, The Black Keys and Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, plus R&B singer Leon Bridges.
