Billy Joel made his final night at Madison Square a family affair!
The iconic singer closed out a 10-year residency at the New York City landmark venue on Thursday, and was accompanied by his two young daughters -- who weren't even born yet when their father began the shows back in 2014.
Billy was joined onstage byÂ Della Rose Joel, 8, and Remy Anne Joel, 6 for a special moment that fans captured on TikTok. Della even showed off how well she knows her dad's lyrics, belting out the words to his 1978 hit "My Life."
In addition to Della and Remy -- whom he shares with his current wife, Alexis Roderick -- Billy is also a father to Alexa Ray Joel, 38, whom he shares with second wife Christie Brinkley.
Alexa Ray also joined her dad for several shows during his final MSG run. During her last performance, she dedicated the emotional ballad "To Sir, With Love" -- from the soundtrack of the 1967 Sidney Poitier film of the same name -- to her legendary father.
As fans learned earlier this year, "My Life" isn't the only one of Billy's songs that his youngest girls love. He told ET on the red carpet for the 2024 GRAMMY Awards -- where the hitmaker performed on the GRAMMYs stage for the first time in 22 years -- that in addition to Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift, Della and Remy were particular fans of his biggest hit.
"Maybe they're doing it because they dig it, but I think they're doing it to annoy me -- they keep playing 'Piano Man.' It drives me nuts," he shared with a laugh.
