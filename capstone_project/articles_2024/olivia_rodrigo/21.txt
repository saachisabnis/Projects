D.Chamberz is suing rapper Ice Spice for copyright infringement over her hit song “In Ha Mood,” TMZ reported.
D.Chamberz accused Ice Spice of stealing the beat, lyrics, hook, rhythmic composition, metrical positioning, and backdrop of his original song, titled “In That Mood,” the lawsuit said, according to TMZ. Ice Spice’s song has reportedly reached certified gold status and the music video has been viewed over 45 million times on YouTube alone. D.Chamberz is suing for no less than half the song’s revenue through publication, as well as additional revenues and damages, the lawsuit revealed, the outlet reported.
Legal filings claim D.Chamberz released the original version of his song, “In That Mood,” a year prior to Ice Spice releasing hers, TMZ reported. He also reportedly claimed to have performed the song on numerous occasions in New York City, according to the lawsuit. These locations were within close proximity to where Ice Spice and her producer, Riot, live, the lawsuit said, according to the outlet.
The lawsuit indicated D.Chamberz released his song on all major digital platforms in Jan. 2022 and alleged Ice Spice’s team and producer ripped off his song after hearing it, TMZ reported. His legal team reportedly claimed the timeline of his original song can be traced back to dates that far precede those of the hit single released by Ice Spice, the lawsuit revealed.
D.Chamberz said his song, “In That Mood,” was played on the airwaves on Hot 97 FM in New York City, the lawsuit said, according to TMZ. The artist reportedly claimed the playtime can be easily tracked to prove his song was released first, and that Ice Spice allegedly ripped him off, the lawsuit revealed.
Ice Spice’s team has not issued a public statement regarding this matter. They did not respond to TMZ’s request for comment, the outlet reported. (RELATED: Pop Star Olivia Rodrigo Accused Of Stealing Concept For ‘Saturday Night Live’ Performance)

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
