The pop stars were out in Los Angeles on Friday (October 25) to witness the premiere of the concert film, Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour. Rodrigo looked stylish on the red carpet in a vintage Dior floor-length dress, while admitting she hadn’t seen the completed film yet, which was shot during her two shows at L.A.’s Intuit Dome in August. “I’ve never actually gotten to watch the GUTS World Tour,” Rodrigo said. “It’s a really fun experience and I just love everyone that’s involved with the show so much — all my band and all my dancers.” 
Chappell Roan was on hand to support Rodrigo at the premiere, after serving as an opening act during the GUTS Tour. Roan called out a photographer while she was on the red carpet. “You were so disrespectful to me at the Grammys,” Roan said as she gestured at the photographer. “You yelled at me at a Grammy party. I remember. You were so rude to me. And I deserve an apology for that … You need to apologize to me.” (Billboard)
