She's talented. She's hilarious. She has an absolute fire personality. And her entire tour is sold out, and has been for a while.
In just a few weeks, Olivia Rodrigo is bringing her Guts World Tour to TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, for two sold out shows, on Monday, April 1, 2024 and Tuesday, April 2, 2024.
Originally, she was only supposed to have the one show on April 1, but with the show selling out so quickly during pre-sale (we should've put a Taylor Swift pre-sale trigger warning in here), she announced the second show the following day, which sold out just as quickly.
And unless you want to pay at least a few hundred dollars for one balcony seat through a third party vendor, tickets are nearly impossible to get (or at least afford).
Until now.
Beginning on Monday, March 11, we're going to hide secret scavenger hunt code words in the articles written by Krissy and Jadd that appear on our app. There will be one secret scavenger hunt code word every single day, Monday through Wednesday, and we'll drop two for you on Thursday.
(You'll know you've found our secret scavenger hunt code word of the day because it will appear in bold, purple font, just like this.)
There will be five secret scavenger hunt code words in total that will spell out a message. The first person to correctly and successfully enter the full five-word message using all five code words into the entry form below will win two sold-out tickets to see Olivia at TD Garden in Boston on Monday, April 1!
We'll contact the winner on Friday, March 15, 2024, with the good news!
Remember! One secret scavenger hunt code word on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then two on Thursday! Code words appear in bold, purple font.
Good luck, have fun, and show us you have the GUTS to win!
