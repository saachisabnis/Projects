Chappell Roan recently stopped by NPR Studios to deliver a Tiny Desk Concert. Roan performed songs from her debut full-length album, 2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.
Chappell Roan’s premiere LP arrived on September 23, 2023. As is Tiny Desk tradition, Roan performed songs from the record in a stripped-down format albeit with a 7-piece ensemble including a string section.
Roan and her band — guitarist Eliza Petrosyan, drummer Lucy Ritter, bassist Valeria Falcon, keyboardist ​​Sarah Hinez, cellist Danica Pinner, violinist Emily Lenck and vocalist Mia Pfirrman — began the Tiny Desk Concert with Midwest Princess standout “Casual.”
Chappell, whose persona for the album is partially inspired by drag performers, continued with the album’s “Pink Pony Club, “Picture You” and “California.” Roan wrapped the session with Midwest Princess single “Red Wine Supernova.”
