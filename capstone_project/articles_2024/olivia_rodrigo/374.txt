Killer Films had a killer 2023, and 2024 is looking equally rosy for the beloved independent production company. Fresh off the heels of scoring a Best Picture nomination for “Past Lives” (the company’s first-ever nomination in that category), co-founder Christine Vachon and Killer Films will be honored at the 6th Annual Kodak Film Awards February 23 with the Film Production Company of the Year award, alongside Celine Song, Ava DuVernay, Hoyte Van Hoytema, Petra Collins, Andrew Haigh, and the limited series “Swarm.”
Although digital continues to be the norm for film productions, 2023 proved to be a banner year for movies shot on film, as evidenced by the breadth of work from this year’s Kodak Film Award honorees, ranging from Song’s intimate “Past Lives” to Hoytema’s epic work on “Oppenheimer.” And 2024 looks equally promising for devoted fans of movies shot on film, with the buzzy releases of “Challengers,” “Nosferatu,” and more.

“We’re excited to celebrate a great year for the film medium. In an era dominated by digital content, artists who create with film — whether for features, television, commercials, or music videos — continue to carve out a distinctive niche,” says Vanessa Bendetti, head of motion picture and entertainment for Kodak. “The visual properties and process of analog filmmaking significantly contribute to a more profound connection between cinematic storytelling and the audience. This year’s honorees’ deliberate choice to shoot on film illustrates not only an appreciation for the analog art form but also a dedication to preserving its legacy.”
Ava DuVernay and Andrew Haigh will be honored with the Auteur Award for their films “Origin” and “All of Us Strangers,” respectively, while fellow writer/director Song will receive the Debut Feature Award for “Past Lives.” The Television Series of the Year award goes to Prime Video’s “Swarm,” while Petra Collins receives the Music Film Director Award for Olivia Rodrigo’s “Vampire” and two-time Academy Award nominee Hoytema (“Oppenheimer”) receives the Lumiere Award, recognizing a distinguished career in cinematography.
The 6th Annual Kodak Film Awards will take place at the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) Clubhouse on Friday, February 23.
