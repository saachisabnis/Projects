Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge just made their red carpet debut in style.
The "So American" singer accompanied her boyfriend for the premiere of his film Disclaimer at the Venice Film Festival on Thursday (August 29). According to photos shared by People, the duo looked cool as they posed for photos together near fans at the iconic festival.
Rodrigo continued to channel '90s vibes with a long black slip dress with black velvet floral details, including a flower along the spaghetti-strap neckline. She completed her vampy look with a black clutch, strappy heels and sunglasses as well as simple jewelry and red lipstick. Her English beau chose a dark suit for the occasion paired with a white shirt with the collar popped, platform boots, slicked-back hair and dark sunglasses.  
The "Brutal" singer showed her support for the actor as he was applauded at the festival, playing the role of proud girlfriend as she filmed him waving to the crowd. As he sat down, he turned around to look at a grinning Rodrigo, still recording on her phone, as seen in a video captured by a fan and shared online.
Earlier this year, Partridge spoke to British Vogue about navigating a relationship under public scrutiny, especially when connected to one of the day's biggest pop stars, saying that dating "probably shouldn't be done in the public eye." Partridge and Rodrigo sparked romance rumors last year before confirming their relationship in December 2023.
"There's enough going on between two people," he said. "You don't need the voices of thousands of others in your head. I think she's got it a lot worse than I have. I can be a bit of a normal person. She's got tons and tones of eyes on her case."
