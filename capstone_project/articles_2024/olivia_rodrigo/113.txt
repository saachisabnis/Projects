My son has a friend whose proud boast is that he comes from a long line of complainers. His grandparents complained about everything, his parents complain about everything, and now he, at the tender age of 16, has joined the family quest. This year alone, he has lodged formal written complaints about the length of his school lunch queue, the inadequate provision of lavatories on Victoria Station, the distribution of tickets for Olivia Rodrigo’s concert tour and the injustice of forcing bookish boys to partake in school sports.
One day, perhaps, he will out-complain even David Fairchild – aka the “Weasenham Whinger”. Mr Fairchild, 72, has complained so much to his parish council that – or so he complains – the council is now silencing his complaints. He says his email correspondence has been forwarded to a separate address, and the council has warned him that he is “now deemed vexatious”.
People who love complaining often are vexatious, in the sense of being annoying. But they are also vital. Most of us are too lazy or busy to take it up with the authorities every time something doesn’t work the way it should. Complaining is unpleasant, time-consuming and thankless, which is why so many organisations get away with providing shoddy services. Imagine how much worse things would be if we didn’t have the likes of Mr Fairchild on the case. An independent audit last year upheld 27 of his 31 complaints to the council. In other words – he was right to complain.
Just as natural selection ensures that every social group contains some soldiers and some peace-makers, so evolution has blessed us with complainers. They go willingly into the purgatory of the customer hotline, so that the rest of us may go free.
Right now, when there is so much terrible bloodshed around the world, it may seem frivolous – even tasteless – to rejoice over a painting that survived a war.
Canaletto’s The Stonemason’s Yard has just gone on display at the National Library of Wales – a homecoming of sorts, since the painting once lived deep under the mountains of Snowdonia. It was hidden there, along with the rest of the contents of the National Gallery, in 1941, when the war was going badly and a German invasion seemed imminent. There had been talk of sending the nation’s art collection to Canada, but the risk of U-boat attacks was too great. “Hide them in caves and cellars,” declared Winston Churchill, “but not one picture shall leave this island.”
And so the disused Manod slate mine was transformed into an Aladdin’s cave of artistic genius. Within its vast caverns, new brick bunkers, each with humidity-controlled air-conditioning, were constructed to house more than 1,800 paintings, including masterpieces by Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Michelangelo. Art experts checked the paintings every day for signs of damage, while security guards lived on site to ensure their safety.
Why would a country facing an existential threat put so much time, energy and money into preserving a load of old paintings? Because art is not frivolous at all. It represents the most admirable aspects of human nature: our curiosity, creativity and ability to communicate profound ideas across different cultures and epochs.
In times of war, art provides a symbol of hope – a promise from the humans of the past, to those longing for a better future.
