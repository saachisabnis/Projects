The folk icon surprises with a rare live performance alongside Luke Combs.
Tracy Chapman's timeless anthem Fast Car reverberated through the 66th Grammy Awards, creating an unforgettable moment as she took the stage alongside country sensation Luke Combs. 
The duo's unexpected collaboration bridged generations and genres, eliciting a standing ovation and heartfelt cheers from a star-studded audience.
Draped in all-black attire, Chapman, the acclaimed folk singer, initiated the performance with the iconic opening chords on her guitar. The audience, which included prime pop luminaries like Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, and Dua Lipa, erupted in enthusiastic applause. 
Chapman and Combs seamlessly shared the spotlight, harmonising beautifully during the chorus. As the performance concluded, the entire crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation. 
Oprah, in the audience, couldn't contain her excitement, and even host Trevor Noah rushed to the stage to express his admiration.

"The legendary Tracy Chapman, everybody," Noah declared. "Thank you so much for that! Thank you so much for that."
In a pre-performance video, Combs shared his thoughts on Chapman's enduring legacy. 
"Tracy Chapman is such an icon, and one of the greatest artists that I think any of us will be lucky enough to see," remarked the country star. 
"It’s a full-circle moment for me. Just to be associated with her in any way is super humbling for me."
Fast Car, known for its poignant lyrics addressing familial struggles, poverty, and dreams of a better life, experienced a revival in 2023 when Combs infused his country sensibility into a cover of the track. 
His rendition climbed to number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and secured the CMA Award for Song of the Year, marking a historic moment as the first time a Black woman received this honour. 
The song's popularity extended to former President Barack Obama, who featured Combs' version on his summer 2023 playlist.
While the Recording Academy had initially announced Combs' solo performance at the Grammys, but Variety then broke the surprise news of Tracy Chapman's inclusion. 
Chapman, known for her rarity in public performances in recent years, made this appearance a landmark event for fans and music enthusiasts alike. 
Her previous accolades for Fast Car include winning the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1989, along with nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.
Further recognition for Chapmans' enviable talent came immediately after this special moment, as renewed interest in the singer's original version has shot it straight to the top of the US iTunes charts.
Held at Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena and hosted by Trevor Noah, the 66th Grammy Awards witnessed Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs creating a magical moment, showcasing the enduring power of music across generations and genres.
