According to People, Tate told the crowd it was their “first time singing together.” Sitting on a set of stairs, the couple performed the emotional ballad.
“You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally/ Left here without you,” the lyrics go. “And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like/ Without you, without you.”
