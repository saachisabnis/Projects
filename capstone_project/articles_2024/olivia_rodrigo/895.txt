Whether it’s Grammy winner Taylor Swift or star NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the biggest names in pop culture have made it their business to make the world a better place.
It’s not unusual for celebrities to donate to charities — Swift, 34, has contributed millions to causes close to her heart throughout her decades-long career — while others, like Mahomes, 29, and Salma Hayek have created their own foundations. Others, including Jennie Garth, have teamed up with nonprofit organizations to spread awareness about important topics.
“I’m proud to partner with the American Heart Association, whose impressive year-round efforts have made a difference in countless lives,” the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 52, told Us for Us Weekly’s Humankind Issue, on stands now. “My father passed away from heart disease, and ever since, I’ve felt a deeply personal connection to prioritizing my health and regularly seeing a cardiologist. Continuing to educate women about their risks for heart disease is essential.”

Jon Bon Jovi and Jelly Roll have also made it their mission to give back to the communities that helped shape them and, as a result, their careers.
