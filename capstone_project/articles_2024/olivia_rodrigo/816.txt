Chappell Roan joined Olivia Rodrigo on stage at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles on Aug. 20 to perform Roan’s hit song “Hot to Go!” together. The superstars wore similarly striking outfits, both featuring a bold black leather boot.
On a meteoric rise to fame, Roan was a surprise guest last night at one of Rodrigo’s Guts Tour stops in Los Angeles. This appearance took place months after the midwestern native opened for the Guts Tour earlier in 2024, and two years after she opened for the Sour Tour.
Rodrigo and Chappell Roan both use their on stage performances to showcase their unique sartorial preferences. On stage last night, their styles aligned as they danced and sang in fishnet tights, minidresses and black leather boots. Rodrigo’s ensemble consisted of a black bra and briefs underneath a sparkling netted dress. Roan, who is known for her campy outfits, wore a sparkling pink dress adorned with colorful flowers and gems.

Roan rounded out her on-stage aesthetic with a pair of tall black boots. The shoes reached the upper calf area and were made of a leather material that clung to the leg. The design also featured a pointed toe and a block heel. Similar styles to this one can be found from a range of brands including Naked Wolfe and Christian Louboutin.
The “Good Luck, Babe!” singer has made fashion a distinctive part of her artistic image. Roan recently brought two looks to a recent appearance on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,” dressing as a black swan and a white swan with footwear to match.
A style icon in her own right, Rodrigo is known to wear Dr. Martens boots while on stage, serving as a foundational element to her aesthetic blending Y2K and grunge elements. She often wears a variation of the brand’s signature boot silhouette. The $200 Jadon boot features a zipper on the side (while the 1460 boot does not) and elevates the shoe with a platform.
Rodrigo’s dancers coordinated with the singer on stage in their own pairs of black Dr. Martens boots, further emphasizing how the silhouette contributes to the visual style of the show.

 









The “Drivers License” singer is a fan of the brand off stage as well, having stepped out in a pair of 8065 Mary Jane shoes alongside friend and fellow musician Conan Gray earlier this year; he opted for black boots from the British footwear company specializing in leather shoes.
