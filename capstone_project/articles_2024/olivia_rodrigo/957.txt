 A compilation of Princess Charlotte's interactions with her brothers Prince George and Prince Louis on TikTok has led Royal fans to draw comparisons between her and the late Queen Elizabeth II. 
The footage, presented on TikTok, reveals the young royal, mimicking behaviours often seen from her great-grandmother throughout history, while standing next to her siblings.
 With the caption ' Princess Charlotte keeping her brothers in check', the video opens with a 2022 clip where it seems she instructs her elder brother George to stand tall - a direction he obediently follows. 
Furthermore, during the recent Trooping the Colour parade, she nudges Louis at his waistline ensuring he concentrates on the event unfolding below them.
 Charlotte's behaviour provides a striking comparison to Queen Elizabeth's usual manner, frequently observed subtly guiding William on the Royal balcony throughout his childhood and adult life.
Running concurrently with Olivia Rodrigo's hit song 'Deja Vu', an excited TikTok user expressed: "Princess Charlotte looks a lot like Queen Elizabeth. She also has her spirit." Another chimes in saying: "She's so darling." While a third observes her sisterly role.
 This Sunday saw Princess Charlotte's touching act towards her father, Prince William, shine through in an endearing Father's Day snap, making her "stand out" amongst her two brothers. 
 In a Royal first, Prince George, Prince Louis and Charlotte released their own personalised message for their dad in honour of Father's Day on June 16. 
The family released a brand-new picture alongside the sweet message, which read: "We love you, Papa. Happy Father's Day [pink-heart emoji] G, C & L."
Speaking to the Mirror, body language expert Judi James pointed out that it is nine-year-old Charlotte who is seen "clinging" to their dad in the sweet snap.
She said: "Itâ€™s Charlotte who actually clings to her dad here, though, wrapping her arm round his waist to lean into his torso."
