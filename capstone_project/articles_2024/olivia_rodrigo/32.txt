New music
Multiple A-list stars have been rumored to be on the list for consideration to play the popular 007 agent. And while producers have yet to make a decision on who is the best fit for James Bond, there are more speculations about the musician chosen to sing the next theme song for the fan-favorite franchise.
Some of the actors that are reportedly considered for the role are Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Paul Mescal, Henry Cavill, Damson Idris, Callum Turner, Theo James, Jack Lowden, Regé-Jean Page, among others. The decision is rumored to be announced in 2025, as producer Barbara Broccoli previously said that the next Bond film would take "a couple of years off" after Daniel Craig's departure.
From Billie Eilish to Adele and Sam Smith, big names have made their own renditions of the James Bond theme song, creating a moody and dark atmosphere for the movie. This year, one of the biggest favorites to take on the responsibility is none other than Dua Lipa.
The singer previously showed interest during her interview on ‘Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,' which could be a great comeback after her latest album ‘Radical Optimism’ underperformed at the Grammys.
Lady Gaga could be another candidate for the performance, following her 'Joker: Folie à Deux' role and her interest in jazz, contemporary pop, and rock genres. Taylor Swift has been mentioned in the conversation, as well as Olivia Rodrigo, and Sabrina Carpenter, which would be a slight shift from previous performances.
While the last artist to have taken on the honor was Billie Eilish, it wouldn't be surprising if producers go for a previous performer, with Adele also being a fan-favorite choice. Throughout the franchise, other legendary musicians have shown their talent, including  Nancy Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Tina Turner, Madonna, and many more.
