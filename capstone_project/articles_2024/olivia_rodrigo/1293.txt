Love is decidedly not embarrassing for Olivia Rodrigo and her boyfriend, Louis Partridge.
Rodrigo and Partridge were first linked in fall 2023 when they were spotted packing on the PDA in the actor’s native London.
“Dating probably shouldn’t be done in the public eye,” Partridge told British Vogue in a March 2024 profile. “There’s enough going on between two people. You don’t need the voices of thousands of others in your head. I think she’s got it a lot worse than I have. I can be a bit of a normal person. She’s got tons and tons of eyes on her case.”
He added, “If there’s a load of people nattering in a room about you, you can choose to put your ear to the door to hear what they say or not. I think you’re probably better off not letting curiosity get the better of you.”
Five months later, the pop star and Partridge made their red carpet debut at the Venice International Film Festival premiere of his Apple TV+ series Disclaimer.
Keep scrolling for the pair’s complete relationship timeline:
Rodrigo and Partridge were first spotted together in London in October. Two months later, Partridge jetted across the pond to New York City to attend her Jingle Ball concert and Saturday Night Live return.
Rodrigo’s fans were convinced that she subtly soft-launched their relationship in a January photo dump on Instagram. In a post captioned “These days🌼🌼🌼,” Rodrigo included a photo of herself playing darts. According to the scoreboard, “OR” was competing against “LP.”
Up until this point, Rodrigo hadn’t outright confirmed whether she was dating the actor. After dropping sophomore album Guts, fans theorized that the song “So American” was about Partridge.
“And he laughs at all my jokes / And he says I’m so American / Oh God, it’s just not fair of him / To make me feel this much,” Rodrigo sings. “I’d go anywhere he goes / And he says I’m so American /Oh God, I’m gonna marry him / If he keeps this s— up.” 
Partridge also declined to address whether he is Rodrigo’s muse, telling Elle the following October, “Not my song, not my place. So, I wouldn’t know.”
Around the same time, eagle-eyed fans kept noticing Partridge attending U.S. shows on Rodrigo’s Guts tour.
