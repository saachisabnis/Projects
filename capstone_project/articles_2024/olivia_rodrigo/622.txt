Olivia Rodrigo is opening up about some of her dating dealbreakers, including the "oddly specific question" she asks on a first date to see if her potential match is a walking red flag.
The "Vampire" singer recently sat down with Netflix to discuss some of the outfits she wore during her GUTS world tour, which was also captured in the new documentary Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour, including one top she wore that read "Dump Him," per People. 
In a video shared to the streaming giant's Instagram, Rodrigo revealed the unique query she asks on first dates to see if they are compatible; however, rather than inquiring about families and five-year plans, her need-to-know question is more out of this world.
"The biggest red flag, okay, this is a very oddly specific question that I ask guys on first dates," she said. "I always ask them if they think that they would want to go to space."
While the cosmic curiosity seems out of the blue, the "Get Him Back!" hitmaker believes her date's answer says a lot about them as a person.
"And if they say yes, I don't date them," she said. "I just think if you want to go to space, you're a little too full of yourself. I think it's just weird."
It appears that Rodrigo doesn't have to worry about first dates any time soon as she has been linked to Enola Holmes actor Louis Partridge since last year, with the pair seemingly confirming their relationship after being photographed kissing in December 2023. Earlier this year, the musician even accompanied her beau to the Venice Film Festival where she played the role of supportive girlfriend as she proudly filmed him waving to the crowd at the premiere of his film Disclaimer.
Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour is available now on Netflix.
