Q1 2024 ResultsRevenue for the first quarter of 2024 was €2,594 million, an increase of 5.8% year-over-year, or 7.9% in constant currency, driven by healthy growth in all segments, as discussed further below. 
EBITDA for the quarter grew 87.7% year-over-year, or 95.2% in constant currency, to €490 million and EBITDA margin was 18.9%, compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of 2023. This increase reflects lower non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €101 million during the first quarter of 2024, compared to €261 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses during the first quarter of 2023. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses, Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €591 million, up 13.2% year-over-year, or 15.9% in constant currency, and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.5 percentage points to 22.8%, compared to 21.3% in the first quarter of 2023, as a result of revenue growth, operating leverage and incremental cash compensation savings of €12 million associated with the equity plan rollout compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Q1 2024Recorded Music revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was €1,989 million, up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2023, or 5.6% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew 10.7% year-over-year, or 12.5% in constant currency, driven by the growth in global subscribers as well as the continued benefit of price increases at certain platforms. Streaming revenue grew 8.9% year-over-year, or 10.3% in constant currency, as the advertising industry continued to recover. Physical revenue decreased by 18.5% year-over-year, or 14.4% in constant currency, largely due to a very difficult year-over-year comparison, particularly in Japan. Downloads and other digital revenue declined 16.4% year-over-year, or 13.2% in constant currency, as download sales continued their industry-wide decline. License and other revenue declined 1.8% year-over-year, or 0.4% in constant currency, due to a timing-related decline in synchronization revenue. Top sellers for the quarter included releases from Taylor Swift, Noah Kahan, Morgan Wallen, Ariana Grande and Olivia Rodrigo, while top sellers in the prior-year quarter included releases from King & Prince, Morgan Wallen, Taylor Swift, TOMORROW X TOGETHER and back number.

Definitions
In this press release, UMG presents certain financial measures when discussing UMG's performance that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS ("non-IFRS"). These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance, profitability, financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition, it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG, thereby affecting comparability.
EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses, which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA, the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:
i.     amortization of intangible assets;ii.     impairment on goodwill and other intangibles;iii.     depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;iv.     (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets, including right of use assets and intangible assets; andv.     restructuring expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.
