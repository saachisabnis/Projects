The singer gave the performance of a lifetime to celebrate her decades-long career.
Joni Mitchell—aka the musical genius behind iconic songs like “Big Yellow Taxi” (as covered by Harry Styles) and the unexpected holiday classic “River”—just made history with her first-ever (!!!) Grammys performance in her decades-long career. Since she broke out into the scene during the 1960s folk-music circuit, her raw and structural songwriting has transcended and impacted several generations. Some might even argue that we wouldn’t have the songwriting prowess of artists like John Legend, Olivia Rodrigo, and Phoebe Bridgers if it hadn’t been for Joni’s impact. 
Her live album Joni Mitchell at Newport [Live] was recorded at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, which marked her first live performance in 20 years. The album also won the award for Best Folk Album at this year’s Grammys, where the legendary songwriter performed “Both Sides Now” with Brandi Carlile.
As expected, this was the general vibe:
Joni’s historical performance was announced ahead of music’s biggest night on the Recording Academy’s official Instagram account. Joni has been recognized by the Academy multiple times throughout her career, but this marks her first time hitting the stage.
Aside from winning nine Grammys over the years, Joni was bestowed with the honor of being the 2022 Person of the Year by MusiCares, a charity that supports musicians by “providing a safety net of critical health and human services.” She joined the ranks with other recipients (and fellow music vets) like Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Carole King, Barbra Streisand, and Bruce Springsteen. 
Glad to see Joni completing her personal Grammy trifecta with her stunning performance at the 2024 ceremony, because it’s about damn time. 👏🥲
