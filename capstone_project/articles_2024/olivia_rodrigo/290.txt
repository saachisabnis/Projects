Dame Zandra Rhodes
Kent State University School of Fashion inducted British fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes into its 35th Hall of Fame during Fashion Week 2024. Rhodes joins an esteemed list of previous inductees, which includes renowned names such as Omar Salam, Kenneth Cole, Estee Lauder, Oscar de la Renta, Dana Buchman, Leonardo Ferragamo, and Josie Natori.
It was a week full of events at KSU School of Fashion, including the annual student fashion show and lectures from the industry's experts on the future of fashion. The renowned fashion designer Anna Sui also attended as a special guest to support her long-time friend, Zandra Rhodes. I was honored to speak at KSU's Fashion Merchandising Symposium, and our group also got to visit the Korean Couture: Generations of Revolution exhibit at The Cleveland Museum of Art. I was fortunate enough to ride with Dame Zandra Rhodes and Anna Sui, and I used this chance to conduct an exclusive interview. During the interview in the car, we discussed the evolving landscape of the fashion industry and their aspirations for a lasting legacy, and we even touched on the intriguing topic of celebrities' influence in the world of fashion.
The two long-time friends met in 1974 at Zandra Rhodes' first fashion show at the New York Circle in the Square Theater. Sui reminisced about her first experience attending a fashion show with Stephen Mizell, which was Rhodes'. The event was located downstairs, accessible via an escalator, and when they arrived, they were surprised to see Diana Vreeland, Bill Blass, Jay Lane, and other New York designers. The show's models included Pat Cleveland and Donna Jordan, and there was a rumor that Bianca (Jagger) would also be modeling for Rhodes. Back then, show tickets were available for purchase, and Sui and Mizell were thrilled to attend. After the show, Sui introduced herself to Rhodes and invited her to her own fashion show. From that day forward, whenever Sui visited London, she would stop by Rhodes' Fashion and Textile Museum and ask for her.

Chan: Zandra, have you ever been unexpectedly inspired by something or someone for your designs? Something that you might surprise your fans with?
Rhodes: That's an interesting perspective. Inspiration can come from unexpected sources. For instance, I once received a bouquet of lilies in Japan, which prompted me to draw them. I keep an open mind to different things for inspiration. Sometimes, meeting new people can lead to amazing experiences you never expected. Traveling has benefited me, as you never know what surprises may come your way. Being open and receptive to whatever might spark your creativity is essential as a designer.
Chan: Have you ever had a fashion faux pas moment? If so, how did you handle it?
Rhodes: It's easy to make a mistake with your outfit when you're a freshman. You may think you're going to a formal event and dressing up, only to find it casual. It can make you feel out of place. However, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed. It respects the people and the occasion you're attending, whether it's a ball or a dinner. I always remember the story of a friend having a dinner party for eight people in the country. Two of the guests arrived in full evening dress. They said, "Well, we just felt like dressing up."
As we engaged in a lively conversation, I took the chance to delve into one of my favorite topics: the role of celebrities in shaping fashion trends. I was curious to know more about their impact on the fashion industry and how their style choices influence people's preferences. The exciting discussion shed light on the complex relationship between celebrity culture and the fashion world.
Sui's response reiterated how celebrities have always been trendsetters in some form or another. It's fascinating to see how their choices can influence the direction of fashion. It is a symbiotic relationship where fashion designers can draw inspiration from celebrities and vice versa.
"We are dressing young iconic celebrities famous among teens and Gen Z. Olivia Rodrigo and Zendaya have worn our clothes recently. Suki Waterhouse was wearing our clothes in her new video. Additionally, Ariana Grande has also been seen wearing our clothing. It's exhilarating for us, and it feels like my career has come full circle once again. We are grateful for these exciting opportunities.", said Sui.
Rhodes shared an exciting story about one of the first big celebrities she ever dressed, Zsa Zsa Gabor. Rhodes was to design and dress Gabor during a film shoot in London. However, celebrities can be highly demanding, and Gabor was no exception. "Zsa Zsa would find things wrong with the dress like it didn't fit her right at the bust and other places. I was trembling all over," said Rhodes.
Years later, when Rhodes met Gabor at a chic luncheon in Hollywood, she asked if Gabor had given the dresses away after she had finished filming. Gabor replied, "Oh no, darling, they were so lovely I kept them." Rhodes couldn't believe it, considering what Gabor had put her through. "She had my assistant in tears. It was a lot of work," recalled Rhodes.
Chan: In terms of fashion, who is your favorite celebrity today?
Rhodes: In this business, if the clients feel good about what they wear and look great, it's an outstanding achievement. For instance, I designed Barbra Streisand's flowing silk chiffon kaftan outfit for her performance in Hyde Park, London just before the pandemic hit. It was a challenging yet exciting experience for me. My approach is to ask my clients how they want to move and design the dress accordingly so it looks great even when they stretch their arms out. It's always a thrill to see a celebrity choosing to wear my creations. Their influence can amplify the reach of my designs and introduce them to a broader audience. It's a beautiful validation of the artistry and craftsmanship that goes into each piece.
Chan: Since we were on our way to the art museum, do you have a favorite artist?
Rhodes: I would like a David Hockney painting hanging in my house.
Sui: I adore the British Pre-Raphaelite painters and recently attended a 400-piece exhibition curated by my friend in Forli, Italy. Among them, John William Waterhouse's works are my favorite.
Chan: What would you like your legacy in the fashion world to be, and what impact do you hope to have?
Rhodes: Prints that brightened their lives and influenced the shape of the dresses are true works of art. As a print designer, I am constantly inspired by the magic that prints can add to fabric. It's a beautiful thing that will remain timeless and bring joy for years. Moreover, it will remain a piece of art.
Sui: People often comment on my clothes and designs and mention the sense of humor that comes with them. My creations tend to bring smiles to people's faces, and they enjoy wearing them. It's the biggest compliment when someone tells me they still have my dress from years ago and continue to wear it. It means that the piece has a special place in their hearts.
I wished my car ride with two of the greatest fashion designers of our time, Zandra Rhodes and Anna Sui, was much longer. Despite its short length, the conversation was lively and inspiring, giving us a glimpse into these two visionaries' creative processes and aspirations. The interview focused on fashion and highlighted the complex relationship between inspiration, creativity, celebrity influence, and visionary design. Their honest and humorous responses were a joy to hear, and it was admirable to witness their strong friendship and support towards each other. They provided an insightful look into the multifaceted world of fashion, reminding us that fashion is not just about clothing but a means to inspire and shape the world around us.
