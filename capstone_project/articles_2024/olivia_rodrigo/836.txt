Travis Scott has revealed what he think of Coldplay’s cover of “Goosebumps” after a clip of the British band performing the song went viral.
At a recent concert, frontman Chris Martin took song requests from fans with somebody in the audience apparently shouting “Goosebumps”.
Martin was excited by the mention and said: “‘Goosebumps’, that’s my favorite Travis Scott song,” before putting their own spin on one of the Houston rapper’s most popular songs.
After the clip of Coldplay performing the cover went viral, Scott responded to the band, writing on X (formerly Twitter): “This got it. [goat emoji].”

Martin had previously revealed that Scott was one of the contemporary artists he listens to, thanks to his children.

He said to USA Today: “It’s cool when your kids start getting you into things. That’s how I got into Travis Scott or The 1975 or Olivia Rodrigo or whoever it may be.”
It’s also not the band’s first foray into Hip Hop after collaborations with Kanye West and JAY-Z while Frank Ocean previously put his own spin on “Strawberry Swing”.
Meanwhile, Scott is apparently hard at work in the studio working on his follow-up to the commercial smash hit Utopia.
