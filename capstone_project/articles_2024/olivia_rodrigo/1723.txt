It's giving 'my four-year-old cut her own bangs'... but in the best way possible
What's more exciting than the release of Olivia Rodrigo's 'obsessed' music video? Why, her debuting a brand new fringed haircut within the same breath, ofc! Happy Friday, friends.
Now, ICYMI (which, I'm sure you haven't but alas), Olivia took to social media to share that the deluxe edition of her most recent album 'GUTS (spilled)' ‚Äì which features five new songs ‚Äì is now available to stream. And along with this, she also released a music video to one of the five new tracks, 'obsessed'. You keeping up?
As mentioned, in the video (which you can watch via the YouTube link, below), Olivia looks a little different, thanks to her fresh micro-fringe haircut!
The length is so short that only half of her forehead is in guise, making for a vampiric finish. And while not finished with a triangular cut ‚Äì like the widow's peak edge of classic 'vampire bangs' ‚Äì the hacked, jagged ends do give off major gothic vibes. 
Now, having said all that, we must acknowledge that this hairstyle of Olivia's is more than likely a wig... boo! After all, like with most professional shoots, this music video would have been filmed way in advance making this very micro-fringe a thing of the past.
Nevertheless, there's no denying that Olivia looks as chic and mod as ever with the style... So, to that, we simply say (read: chant) #BringBackTheVampireBangs!
