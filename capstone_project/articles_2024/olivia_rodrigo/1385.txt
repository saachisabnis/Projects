Olivia Rodrigo had a scary moment during her Guts tour in Australia when she fell through a trap door on stage in front of a 14,000-strong crowd in Melbourne. The shocking incident was captured on video and shared on social media, with fans expressing relief that she was unharmed. Despite the fall, Olivia managed to pull herself back up and reassured the audience with humor. Following the mishap, bookies are predicting that the Grammy winner may headline Glastonbury in 2025, with bets being suspended on her potential performance at the iconic festival.
