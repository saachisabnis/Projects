Decorated folk musician Joni Mitchell has announced that on October 19, 2024, she will participate in her first live performance in Los Angeles since 2000. The show is billed to include longtime friend and musical collaborator Brandi Carlile and the Joni Jam. The impending concert is scheduled for the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. 
News of Mitchell’s Hollywood Bowl stand arrives after Monday’s announcement that she will deliver her debut performance at this year’s Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 4, in addition to  Luke Combs, Dua Lipa, Burna Boy, Billie Eilish, Travis Scott and Olivia Rodrigo, all of which are slated to deliver live performances during the award ceremony. 
Recently, Mitchell has dipped her toes back into live performances, beginning at the 2022 edition of the Newport Folk Festival–which served as her first full-set delivery in 20 years. To follow, she hosted a headlining weekend at the Gorge Amphitheater, dubbed the Joni Jam, in Quincy, Wash., on June 9 and 10, 2023. 
Included in the aforementioned Scabland gathering were fellow musicians Annie Lennox, Sarah McLachlan, Marcus Mumford, Wynonna Judd, Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Lucius and more. A live album, Joni Mitchell at Newport, was also announced to mark Mitchell’s grand return. The set is nominated for Best Folk Album at this year’s Grammy Awards. 
Tickets will be available for Joni’s presale on Wednesday, January 31, and the tickets for the general public will go on sale Friday, February 2. Tickets will be available for purchase here.
