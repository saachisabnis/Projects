Taylor Swift will perform in Madrid on May 29-30.AP
Madrid is ready to feel “Enchanted” by Taylor Swift this coming weekend.
Swift will head to Madrid, Spain to perform at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium on May 29-30, and Swifties should get excited about how cheap tickets are.
The fact that tickets are under $150 — cheaper than the tickets for her Lisbon concerts — means that they are most likely going to sell out fast. These prices are right next to Sweden’s as the biggest steals of the “Eras Tour” yet.
Here’s everything you need to know to see Taylor Swift live on her international tour.
Throughout the “Eras Tour,” the cheapest last-minute tickets for Swift’s 2024 concerts have been on StubHub and Vivid Seats.
As of now, the cheapest ticket for Swift’s May 29 “Eras Tour” concert in Madrid is $112 on StubHub, with tickets being listed as high as $6,145.
For her May 30 show, the cheapest ticket at the time of publication is $89 on StubHub, with other tickets being listed as high as $2,363.
First-time Vivid Seats users can save $20 on ticket orders over $200 by entering promo code NJ20 at checkout.
Fans also should check out other secondary sites to snag last-minute tickets, like TicketCity and TicketNetwork.
Taylor Swift will perform 84 shows throughout the second leg of her “Eras Tour.”
Her next shows will be in Lyon, France from June 2-3. Tickets are available on several secondary market sites, like StubHub, Vivid Seats, TicketCity and TicketNetwork.
