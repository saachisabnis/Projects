This isn’t the first time the “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” alum has faced challenges on her tour. Earlier in the year, while performing in London, Rodrigo had to deal with an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. During a performance of her song, “Love Is Embarrassing,” the clasps on her top came undone, leaving her scrambling to prevent an even more revealing moment. As she clutched her chest to keep her top from falling, Rodrigo joked with the audience, saying, “This is…embarrassing… I almost flashed you guys, but it’s okay now!”
