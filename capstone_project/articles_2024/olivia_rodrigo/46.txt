Object & Animal has signed director Daniel Warwick for representation in the U.S., U.K. and the Netherlands.
Warwick, known for his cinematic scale and off-beat narratives, has won assorted awards including Grand Prix at Ciclope, Cannes Lions and D&ADs. His noted work spans such clients as Kathmandu, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Adidas, Coors, and adult store Eis.de.
“Having produced for Daniel back in the day, I know first hand the energy, joy and fun he brings to the creative process,” said Dom Thomas, founding partner, Object & Animal. “His way of seeing the world, collaborative spirit and passion for the craft of storytelling is inspiring.”
Prior to joining Object & Animal, Warwick had most recently been repped in the U.S. and U.K. by Biscuit Filmworks.

Farber later said it was the first time in 13 years that he'd used the gavel.
Weinstein is charged with sexually assaulting Haley and another woman, Kaja Sokola, and raping a third, Jessica Mann. Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify.
Weinstein denies the allegations and his lawyers argue that his accusers had consensual encounters with a then-powerful movie producer who could advance their careers.
