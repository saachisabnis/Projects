I’m looking away in shame right now
Sooner or later, the curse of Spotify Wrapped will get us all and we’ll sit there humiliated looking at the songs we spent thousands of minutes shamelessly listening to. Alternatively, you’ll spend the whole day skipping through everyone else’s top five wondering why you even opened the Instagram app in the first place. While you wait for the day to arrive, here are the top Spotify Wrapped songs over the years. If you have had any of these on your Wrapped, you’re officially basic. I don’t make the rules!

We begin as far back as Spotify will take us, and before it had all the cute graphics. Drake and Post Malone dominated the most-streamed songs, which put me right back in my teenage feels.

Although there’s only a record of the top three, these songs pretty much summarise what life felt like in 2019. As the last year before COVID-19 came and permanently changed the course of all our lives, living was easy and everything was cheap. Camila and Shawn were dating, Billie Eilish was on the rise, and Post Malone was writing bangers and destroying guitars onstage at Reading Festival. For the love of it all, take me back!

2020 feels like a fever dream to most people, and seeing Dance Monkey on a most streamed list should be illegal. However, finally seeing The Weeknd make an appearance is a great feeling. Love you, king!

2021 was a wild year for 18 year old Olivia Rodrigo, who instantly shot to fame after releasing her first album, Sour. The fact that she has two tracks on the most globally streamed songs from a debut album is beyond monumental. She deserves it and all of those Grammys!
2021 was also the year of Lil Nas X and I’m glad he got his moment.

Life was sunny in 2022 and Latin music was in its full element. Bad Bunny made it onto the list twice, and As It Was secured the number one title. It’s no shocker that Heat Waves made it on, as it was literally the song of TikTok for the entire year.

All of these bangers were songs of last year, and it’s no surprise Flowers by Miley Cyrus was on top. We also can’t forget the iconic Kill Bill. There are a few surprises on there like Cruel Summer which was released in 2019, and As It Was which makes an appearance in Wrapped 2022.
