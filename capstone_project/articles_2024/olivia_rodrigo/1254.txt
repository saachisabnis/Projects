Olivia Rodrigo is all grown up. 
The former Disney Channel star got candid about how she celebrated her 21st birthday during the opening night of her Guts World Tour in Palm Springs, Calif. 
“I went to the gas station the other day and bought a pack of cigarettes and a six-pack of beer,” the “Vampire” hitmaker said while sitting at the piano, as seen in fan videos posted on TikTok. 
“I promise I didn’t consume it, but I just bought it because I f–king could,” she went on.
“Anyway, all this to say that I think growing up isn’t so scary after all and life just kind of gets better at the end,” she concluded, before performing her 2023 track, “Teenage Dream.”
The “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” alum celebrated her milestone birthday earlier this week. 
She rang in the occasion with a low-key party, and joked that she would no longer “hypothetically” be consuming alcohol illegally.
“Today is my last day of being able to under age drink (hypothetically) !!!!” she joked in the caption of an Instagram post Monday.
The “Vampire” songstress was joined by actress Iris Apatow along with fellow musicians Conan Gray and Tate McRae. 
The “Greedy” singer’s rumored new beau, The Kid Laroi, was also seen in one of the snaps from the bash, however, Rodrigo’s possible new man, Louis Partridge, didn’t appear to be in attendance.
