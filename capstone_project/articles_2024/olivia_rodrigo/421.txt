Olivia Rodrigo proved that she’s a woman of her word after handing out emergency contraception and condoms to fans during her “Guts World Tour.”
The 21-year-old singer showed her dedication to the cause of reproductive health freedom by providing concert-goers in St. Louis, Missouri, free contraception as part of her Fund 4 Good initiative.
Olivia’s activism began back in May 2022, when a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion revealed the court’s early vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, which granted the federal right to abortion in the United States.

At the time, the “Good 4 You” singer stopped a concert in Washington, DC,to voice her concerns about the decision.
“Because we’re in DC, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to say how heartbroken I am over the Supreme Court’s potential decision,” she told her fans.
“I hope we can raise our voices to protect our right to have a safe abortion, which is a right that so many people before us have worked so hard to get.
“Our bodies should never be in the hands of politicians.”
Abortions were outlawed in 14 states just a month after her speech. In Missouri, where Olivia gave fans access to emergency contraception, abortion is banned aside from “very limited exceptions, including medical emergencies.”

The “Bad Idea, Right?” singer also called out the five conservative justices who chose to overturn the landmark decision during a performance at England’s Glastonbury musical festival.
“I’m devastated and terrified. So many women and so many girls will die because of this,” Olivia said.
“I want to dedicate this next song to the five members of the Supreme Court who have shown us that, at the end of the day, they truly don’t give a sh*t about freedom.”
She was then joined on stage by Lily Allen to perform a rendition of Lily’s 2008 song, “Fuck You.”
“This song goes out to the justices: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh,” Olivia shouted. “We hate you!”

For the North American dates of her tour, the young star partnered with the National Network of Abortion Funds, which aims to build a world where all reproductive options are valued, accessible, and stigma-free. 
“We believe all people know how to best care for their own bodies and build their own families,” the organization’s site reads. 
“And we’re committed to ensuring the conversation about racial, economic, and reproductive justice includes the people most affected by the barriers to abortion access.”
Olivia’s Fund 4 Good initiative “works to support all women, girls, and people seeking reproductive health freedom.”
The singer announced she will donate a portion of ticket sales from each show to local abortion funds. She also has local organizations present at her shows, providing reproductive health information and support to concert-goers.

On Tuesday (March 12), a Missouri fan posted a photo on X (formerly known as Twitter) showing emergency contraception, Julie, which was being handed to attendees.
The FDA-approved contraceptive pill costs approximately $40 at US pharmacies.
Furthermore, the package, branded with Olivia’s “Guts” aesthetic, contained leaflets with information about finding abortion care.
“Free Plan B at @oliviarodrigo in St. Louis tonight. Thank you @MOAbortionFund,” the message read. 
The tweet received 11 million views and gathered thousands of likes and comments.
Another fan shared that the attendees were given condoms free of charge.
People celebrated Olivia’s activism and life-changing initiative, writing, “I stand with Olivia, not everyone wants to be a mother and can’t provide a proper lifestyle for their child.”
“Respect! This is what putting ur money where ur mouth is [looks like],” another person commented.
A third person agreed, saying, “This is genuinely one of the best things I’ve seen a celebrity do on a large scale.”
“There’s still stigma around buying plan b and some vulnerable girls and women feel embarrassed to buy it, this could save someone’s life,” a separate social media user wrote.
According to the World Health Organization, 6 out of 10 of all unintended pregnancies end in an induced abortion in the world.
“Unsafe abortion is a leading – but preventable – cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. It can lead to physical and mental health complications and social and financial burdens for women, communities and health systems,” the site reads.
“Lack of access to safe, timely, affordable and respectful abortion care is a critical public health and human rights issue.”

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.

bemused that the article didn't censor "f**k you" - have they grown up finally?
That aside, this is brilliant.
