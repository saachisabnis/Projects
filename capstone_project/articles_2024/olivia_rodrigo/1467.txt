No doubt about it — No Doubt were beneficiaries of the post-Coachella bump.
Gwen Stefani and company’s catalog saw an 85% increase in U.S. streams following their reunion set on Saturday, April 13, Billboard reports. Streams of “Bathwater,” which featured a surprise Coachella appearance by Olivia Rodrigo, rose by 450%.
Fellow reunited ’90s outfit Sublime, featuring new lead singer Jakob Nowell, the son of late frontman Bradley Nowell, received a 19% gain in streams, and Lana Del Rey‘s headlining performance led to a 36% jump. Even Blur, who chastised the reportedly lackluster crowd during their set, saw a 27% upswing.
Coachella weekend two takes place April 19-21.
