"We'd been trying and it wasn't doing what it usually would do in me. I was honestly like, 'Damn, maybe I hit my peak and I don't know how to write anymore?'But when director Greta Gerwig called and asked her to create a song for the Barbie soundtrack, everything changed.
"Greta saved me, really, honestly," the pop star told the outlet.
"It brought us out of it and immediately we were inspired and wrote so much more after that." (ANI)
