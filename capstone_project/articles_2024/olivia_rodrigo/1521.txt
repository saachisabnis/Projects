SOS! It's a Milan Fashion Week disaster
Normani has been a mainstay on the fashion week scene this season. From London to Milan, she's been sitting front row to take in shows from designers including JW Anderson and Roberto Cavalli. And with such a prime position to view the new fashion trends, you bet she's been bringing it with her own ensembles. 
Having previously donned see-through dresses, latex skirts and thong-exposing jumpsuits, the artist has been staying true to form with her fashion week looks so far. Far from playing it safe, her attire has included a lace loungewear set with an oversized puffer coat and a teeny tiny lace negligee dress that can only be described as lingerie. But with such daring, risquÃ© ensembles, it's inevitable Normani would experience a wardrobe malfunction sooner or later...
Well, that time came yesterday at the Moschino SS25 show during Milan Fashion Week when the brown see-through slip dress she was wearing ended up revealing her nipple pasties.
The floaty dress was cut on the bias and fell all the way to Normani's ankles. As well as featuring pearl straps over her shoulders and a second strand acting as a halterneck fastening, further pearl adornments appeared to be at the back of the dress, attached under the skirt. 
Constructed from a totally transparent chiffon fabric, the naked dress clearly showed the brown knickers she wore underneath â€“ hence the need for nipple pasties. Normani finished the look with pearl drop earrings, tinted brown Y2K frame-less sunglasses and silver strappy heeled sandals.
Unfortunately, the straps seemed to have slipped somehow with the neckline of the dress dipping on the right-hand side to expose more than Normani bargained for. The wardrobe malfunction happened while she was sitting on the front row, forcing her to keep one hand clutched to her chest to keep the dress in place as much as possible for the duration of the show.
Normani is hardly the first to experience such a fashion disaster, with Katy Perry suffering a similar fate while on American Idol and Olivia Rodrigo almost losing her top live on stage. But we're pleased to report all three women handled it like total pros, styling out the mishap with ease. We stan a pragmatic queen!
