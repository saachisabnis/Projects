The nominations for the 2024 Brit Awards have been announced, and it's fantastic news for Raye. 
The singer-songwriter has received a total of seven nominations, including a nod for Artist of the Year, two entries in the Song of the Year category, and recognition for Album of the Year for her brilliantly ambitious debut record, "My 21st Century Blues."
She triumphs over Craig David, Gorillaz and Robbie Williams, each of whom held the previous joint record with six nominations.
This achievement marks a remarkable career turnaround for Raye, who topped the charts at the beginning of 2023 and was previously shortlisted for the prestigious Mercury Prize, after a lengthy battle with her former label, Polydor. 
Following behind Raye, rappers Central Cee and J Hus each have four nominations this year. Blur, Calvin Harris, Dave, Little Simz, Olivia Dean, Young Fathers, and the four-time winner Dua Lipa are all contenders for three awards.
In the international categories, solo artists like Burna Boy, Kylie Minogue, Miley Cyrus, and Taylor Swift are contenders, while bands such as Foo Fighters, Paramore, and Gabriel have been shortlisted for the international group of the year.
This year also marks The Rolling Stones' first Brit Award nomination in over a decade, in the best alternative/rock act category for their chart-topping comeback in October. 
This year marks a significant improvement in gender representation, with women comprising 57% of the total nominees when considering mixed-gender groups.
The progress follows last year's controversy, where no women were nominated for the Brit Awards' Best Artist category. All five nominees for the prize were men: Stormzy, Central Cee, Fred Again, George Ezra and Harry Styles. 
In a notable shift this year, the Artist of the Year category has expanded to include 10 nominees, and six female artists secured nominations. 
Among the female nominees are Arlo Parks, Jessie Ware, Lil Simz, Olivia Sims, and Dua Lipa, while Central Cee, Dave, J. Hus, and Fred Again... represent the male nominees.
This year's International Artist of the year category has also seen improvement for female representation, with eight out of 10 nominees being female.
