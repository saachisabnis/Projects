The Sony LinkBuds Fit are the latest addition to Sony’s mid-range true wireless earbud lineup. Sony has a solid reputation for making some of the best high-end buds, while also catering to people on a budget with more affordable options. The LinkBuds range has already impressed in the past, with models like the original Sony LinkBuds, which have an open-ear design, and the Sony LinkBuds S with a closed design that are perfect for smaller ears.
The LinkBuds Fit take a slightly different approach. The name tends to suggest these buds are targeted at fitness lovers – and they are – but it also hints at their best feature, a fantastic fit. They stay put throughout rigorous workouts, but are also light and comfortable enough for all-day wear while you work.
They won’t beat the very best earbuds when it comes to sound quality or noise cancellation. Sony’s high-end models, like the WF-1000XM5, are considerably better on those fronts and Bose is still ahead of the competition when it comes to ANC, with the QuietComfort Ultra.
But although the LinkBuds Fit don’t have top-tier features, they make up for it with an option that we think is a reliable and versatile choice for most people. They’re perfect for movement, sports, and anyone who has struggled to find earbuds that fit securely without sacrificing comfort.
Let’s start with the fit, which is genuinely excellent. I’ve reviewed many earbuds in this mid-range price bracket, including fitness-focused models, and these are among my favorites. They’re small, lightweight, and versatile, making them ideal for almost anything – whether you’re working at a desk all day or doing intense workouts at the gym.
The fit stands out for several reasons. Each earbud weighs just 4.9g, so light that you might forget you’re wearing them. While there are lighter options – like the budget Jlab Go Pop ANC at 4.1g per bud – few fitness-oriented earbuds with noise cancellation and robust features are this light. For comparison, the Jabra Elite 8 Active, some of my favorites, weigh 5g per bud, and the Sennheiser Momentum Sport buds come in at 6.4g per bud, which is a significant difference for such small devices.
The stability and comfort are enhanced by two key features. First, the silicone tips, which are standard with most true wireless earbuds. Although there are only three sizes included, I found the pre-installed tips surprisingly perfect for my ears, even though I usually size down. That said, the limited tip selection might not suit everyone. Second, the earbuds feature silicone fins that fit snugly into the cartilage of your ear. Initially, I wasn’t a fan of how the fins looked, but they’re very effective at holding the buds in place, which won me over.
These earbuds aren’t just comfortable; they’re incredibly stable. I tested them while running in the rain, perfecting calisthenics skills upside down on parallel bars, attending a yoga class, and working out at the gym. No matter the activity, they stayed firmly in place without ever feeling tight or uncomfortable.
Aesthetically, they have a minimal yet playful design, with an almost bubble-like appearance for both the buds and the charging case. Their small size and lightweight build make them look discreet in your ears, without protruding too much, like some competitors. The design seems aimed at a younger audience, which makes sense given they’re marketed as a collaboration with singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo.
The charging case is a bit chunkier and less streamlined than those of rival buds. While I personally love its unique, slightly marble-like finish (available on the white and green versions), it might not be as pocket-friendly. If you want other colors, the Sony LinkBuds Fit also come in black and violet.
The Sony LinkBuds Fit have two noise-cancelling modes: standard and ambient. The standard mode isn’t best-in-class. For example, I could hear myself typing at my desk and a baby crying in a cafe. However, it effectively blocked out low-frequency sounds like the hum of a heater or the rumble of a train. It seems particularly effective at dampening hums and rumbles rather than completely silencing all noise.
With that in mind, if you want near silence, the Sony LinkBuds Fit might not be the right choice. They’re designed to reduce noise rather than eliminate it completely, which I personally appreciate as it keeps me aware of alarms or emergencies. For those needing to hear their surroundings, the ambient mode also reduces noise while still allowing announcements and other key sounds to come through.
These settings can be adjusted in the Sony Connect app, which is packed with features. You’ll find expected options, like EQ settings (with an intuitive process to determine your favored presets), head-tracking sound, and multipoint pairing. There are also more unique features, such as a mode that makes your music sound more like background noise, adaptive sound control that adjusts based on what you’re doing, and a speak-to-chat feature that pauses music when you talk. If this all feels overwhelming, the good news is you don’t need to customize every feature to enjoy a great experience right out of the box.
Connectivity is robust, with Bluetooth 5.3 supporting AAC, SBC, LDAC, and LC3 codecs, catering to a wide range of preferences and devices.
You can also customize gesture controls via the app. Sony claims you can tap the area below your earlobe or between your ear and sideburn to activate gestures, but I couldn’t get this to work reliably. Instead, I had to tap the buds themselves, which occasionally required a firm tap to register.
Battery life is solid, offering 5.5 hours with noise-canceling on and eight hours without. This matched my testing, though it varies depending on the audio codec and extra features you’re using. With the case, you’ll get just over 20 hours in total. While decent by modern true wireless standards, it’s not exceptional. For example, the more affordable Sony WF-C510s deliver 11 hours of playback but lack noise-cancelling – so your choice depends on your priorities.
As expected for workout-focused earbuds, the LinkBuds Fit have an IPX4 rating, making them resistant to sweat. However, don’t take them in the shower or to the swimming pool.
During testing, the Sony LinkBuds Fit delivered a sound that’s best described as powerful and punchy. While I wasn’t blown away by the detail or richness of the audio, the experience was undeniably enjoyable. The buds provide a bouncy, bass-heavy sound that’s perfect for powering through workouts.
If you’re a fan of boomy, high-energy tracks, these earbuds will hit the mark. I even boosted the bass in the EQ settings for extra impact. While this became fatiguing over time, tracks like Armani White’s Billie Eilish and Hanumankind’s Big Dawgs had an adrenaline-pumping intensity. Similarly, heavy rock like Queens of the Stone Age’s Sick, Sick, Sick sounded meaty and immensely satisfying.
Dramatic ballads like Lana Del Rey’s Ultraviolence also worked well, delivering an emotional punch. For work sessions, I found melodic tracks by Ólafur Arnalds especially enjoyable, often pairing them with the background music effect to improve focus.
However, these buds sacrifice some detail and subtlety in favor of their bass-forward profile. Sony’s DSEE tech, which upscales low quality sound, maybe worked some magic. But it felt like something was lacking a little when I listened to classical music, and expected the richness and expansiveness found in higher-end earbuds. At higher volumes, complex arrangements sounded a bit messy and restrained.
Which is all to say that the LinkBuds Fit excel at delivering a robust, energetic soundtrack for daily activities and workouts. However, if you’re looking to analyze every nuance of your favorite tracks, you’d be better served by a more refined option.
The Sony LinkBuds Fit cost £179 / $179 / AU$348. Although the buds are currently discounted on the Sony website in some regions. At the time of writing, the price in the UK has dropped from £179 to £149.
This price puts the buds in the mid-range category. Cheaper than Sony's WF-1000XM5 earbuds at $299.99 / £259 / AU$499 but more expensive than the Sony WF-C700N at $119 / £99 / AU$199.
Other competitors in this space are the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC at $179 / £179 / AU$299 and the JBL Live Beam 3 at $199.95 / £179.99 / AU$249. There are several at a similar price that are also considered workout-friendly buds too, like the Jabra Elite 8 Active at $199.99 / £199.99 / AU$329, and the Beats Fit Pro at $199 / £199 / AU$299.
What this means is that although you will find good buds that are cheaper and can pay more for better audio performance and features, the wealth of features, the comfy fit, the design and the fitness-friendly specs make the Sony LinkBuds Fit competitively priced and good value.
You’ve struggled to find buds that fit
Whether your ears are small or you get stressed when buds stick out and think you're going to lose one, give these a go. We can't make promises, but think some people will be pleasantly surprised.
You work out a lot
These buds did it all. They came running with me through fields and along the beach, to the gym, the yoga studio and swung around on some parallel bars. They’re super stable and not going anywhere.
You like a cute and considered design
They’re not premium-looking or particularly design-y, but the rounded shape, the marble case, the shiny surface and bubble-like vibe make them cute and Instagrammable. 
You want excellent ANC
I personally enjoyed what the noise-canceling here had to offer, but they’re not fantastic. No near-silent cocoon of sound to be found. Choose Bose or higher-end Sony buds instead.
You prioritize longevity
At 5.5 hours from the buds themselves, it's not like the battery life is bad, but you can find better if that’s a priority for you.
You value a seamless experience
I had to tweak the sound here a little and there's a lot to play around here in the app in terms of features. Is this a good thing? Yes But does it require a fair bit of setup? Also yes.
Beats Fit Pro
A very similar proposition with enjoyable sound and decent ANC, as well as silicone ear fins. More expensive than the Sonys, but they've been around a while so you can find solid discounts. 
Beats Fit Pro review
You'll find a better battery and more durable build from these Jabras – there's a Gen 2 version out now, too. They're also the only workout buds that come close to the Sonys in terms of comfort for me.
Jabra Elite 8 Active review
I tested the Sony LinkBuds Fit every day for two weeks. This gave me the chance to trial them in a range of different environments and all sorts of situations.
I mostly used them to listen to music and podcasts on my iPhone 14 Pro with Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube music. I tested them when I was travelling on a train, working in a busy cafe and a quiet library and at home at my desk. I also took them to the gym when I was using the cardio machines and lifting weights, to the yoga studio, along the beach for several runs, and to an outdoor pull-up bar.
I’ve tested many headphones and earbuds over the past 12 years, with a focus on fitness devices. I’m interested in tech that prioritizes comfort and ease of use.
