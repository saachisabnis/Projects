After sparking a new deal with TikTok earlier this month, Universal Music Group (UMG)
has uploaded its artists’ music back on the social-media platform, including the discography of Billie Eilish. Upon the release of her new album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” the
singer-songwriter has launched a TikTok takeover.  Per the takeover, Eilish fans are able to save her new music to their streaming platform of choice directly from TikTok via the app’s
“Add to Music” feature.Within TikTok, users have the ability to immerse themselves in Eilish’s new record through playlist curation, challenges to unlock exclusive artwork
for their profiles, and the opportunity to be feature in the #HITMEHARDANDSOFT takeover themselves.advertisementadvertisementTikTok is also featuring a Billie Eilish hub, which fans can access through in-app
engagement. In other words, they can unlock special entry points such as a fan-exclusive icon across their For You feed, while also seeking out branded themed animations by searching “Billie
Eilish” and the album's track names in the search bar.After joining TikTok in 2020, Eilish has amassed a following of almost 59 million users, resulting in 296 million likes across her
content and over 7.1 million videos created using a hashtag of her name. Her songs have proven to be incredibly popular among creators, which is why UMG's failure to renew a deal with TikTok in
January, resulting in the label's roster of musicians' music being pulled from the app, upset so many TikTok influencers.Eilish's takeover is similar to Taylor Swift's recent TikTok campaign to promote her
newest album, “The Tortured Poets Department.” However, Swift's in-app campaign, which offered fans a comparable level of exclusive engagement opportunities, came about while UMG was still
battling with TikTok over a possible agreement.Like Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake, and more artists on the UMG label, Eilish's songs were originally taken down in February. Now that
they’re accessible to creators again, TikTok may see an increase in promotional campaigns in the pop community.
