During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday (October 29), Olivia Rodrigo shared a series of entertaining stories with the talk-show host while promoting her new GUTS World Tour concert film. Rodrigo opened up about her recent scary fall into a hole on stage in Melbourne that went viral on social media. “Watching the video back, it’s pretty terrifying,” said the three-time Grammy winner. “I mean the show must go on. That’s showbiz, baby.” Another story detailed how Rodrigo was thoroughly interrogated by Border Patrol agents while she was crossing back into the US from Canada. The agent demanded that she get off the tour bus at 3 a.m., repeatedly asking Rodrigo if she had ever been arrested before. “You know, you could go to jail for lying to a federal officer like this,” he told her, before realizing they were actually searching for an “Olivia Rodriguez.” “Jimmy, I was pissed,” she explained. “I’m like, ‘You didn’t look at the name on the thing?’” (People)
