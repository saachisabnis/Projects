Vinyl record stores in Colorado will be seeing a surge in traffic for national Record Store Day on April 20, 2024. With that, they'd better be stocked with the album that Coloradans seem to be demanding.
It's great that vinyl records are really seeing a resurgence over the last few years; more stores are opening up, more turntables are being bought, more music enjoyment is happening.
Vinyl records definitely are not cheap; to spend your hard-earned dollars on one (or several,) you really have to "love" the songs that are on that piece of vinyl. Of course, with a record you may not "love" every song on the album, but hopefully you get your money's worth out of it.
The folks at BetColorado.com dug into Google Trends data from April of 2023 to April of 2024 to find out why vinyl record was searched for the most in each state. I guess maybe that take that info and make some "prop" bets for us to make, in some fashion.
BetColorado.com's list of the 10 most popular vinyl records includes:
All of those are great albums, a lot of them are Taylor Swift albums; she is very popular.
Taylor's 'Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions;' is Colorado's most-popular vinyl album. Only two other states had that as their favorite; Olivia Rodrigo's 'Guts' was the country's most popular.
Taylor's 'Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions' is a collection of songs that come from the documentary about the making of 'Folklore,' her eighth studio album, which includes the single, 'Cardigan.'
