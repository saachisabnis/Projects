Name: Becki Echoles
From: Colerain
On-Demand Song Request: Bad Idea Right by Olivia Rodrigo
Becki met her husband on Tinder 8 years ago and they have been married for 4 years.  She has traveled to 48 US states and 6 countries.  She also does really good farm animal impressions!  The pig is the best!
She said “What I love the most about the show is how they share their lives with the listeners. I love to hear stories about what they are doing outside of work and about their families. Listening to Tim talk about Chris and selling real estate, led me to their company when my mom passed and I needed someone to sell her house. I love to hear stories from Jenn about Jacob and all her cats. Fritsch and Penelope and Scott stories. I was so excited when Jeff and Kristen got married and love hearing about their lives. It’s like they are all our friends.”
Congratulations Becki!  Welcome to the club, and thanks for listening to Q102! 
Each weekday, Jeff & Jenn will select a new Jeff & Jenn Best Friends Club member of the day, and that winner will receive the following:
