Olivia Rodrigo said in a new interview that she “would love” to return to acting. “I love movies, I love telling stories,” she told Variety. “I really want to do a coming-of-age thing maybe before I’m actually of age. Maybe I am of age already.” She added, “I just love telling stories, whether that be in a song or movie, that’s really something that really excites me.” Rodrigo was also asked about her dream collaborators and picked Noah Kahan, who’s up for Best New Artist at the Grammys this year. “I think he’s so great and he’s very inspiring,” she said, crossing her fingers to the camera. “One of these days.”
