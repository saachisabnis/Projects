During her GUTS World Tour, Olivia Rodrigo announced that she was going to donate a portion of the proceeds from her ticket sales to charities supporting women and children. Now that the tour is nearly over, it’s time to start writing those checks.
The “obsessed” singer is giving more than $2 million to charities around the world from the net proceeds of the GUTS tour ticket sales via her Fund 4 Good initiative. The nonprofits that are receiving money include those that support reproductive rights and girls’ education, and work to prevent gender-based violence. The charities are located throughout the world, from the U.S. and Canada to Europe, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore.
In the Philippines, Olivia did a concert in the world’s largest indoor arena, located in Manila, and arranged for all the tickets to cost under 30 bucks. All the net ticket proceeds from that specific show were donated to a charity that focuses on children’s health, women’s cancers, reproductive health and gender equity.
The GUTS tour officially ends with stadium shows in Mexico in April. Liv is also doing multiple festival shows, including June 27 at British Summertime Hyde Park, the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands on June 21 and Lollapalooza festivals in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Paris.
