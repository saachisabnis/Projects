The Grammy Awards always have one of the most electrifying red carpets when it comes to fashion, as singers and musicians come with such style and flair that provide so many memorable moments, from Lady Gaga‘s meat dress to Ariana Grande‘s tulle princess gown.
2024’s most anticipated star is Taylor Swift, who is up for six Grammys. She already slayed the Golden Globes red carpet in a shiny green Gucci gown and wore a sensational midnight blue long-sleeved crop top and skirt to the 2023 awards to match her album Midnights.
Other stars known for their distinct red carpet style who will be performing at the event include Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodrigo, SZA and Billie Eilish. The big question is will they dazzle with their Grammy night looks or end up having a case of fashion regret?
