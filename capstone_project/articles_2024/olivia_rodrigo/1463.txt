In a New York Times profile on Dan Nigro that was published on Monday (October 21), the celebrated producer reveals details about the progress of Chappell Roan’s new album and what it will sound like. Nigro, who has also worked with Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray, co-wrote and produced Roan’s Billboard No. 2 charting debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, and is working with the pop superstar on her highly anticipated follow-up. The duo has already finished five tracks for the new record, including what Nigro refers to as a “fun, up-tempo country song,” a “couple of ballads” and a “mid-tempo rock song.” Roan has also been performing a new song, “The Subway,” during recent shows on The Midwest Princess Tour. Nigro is encouraged by what he has heard with the new material. “I’ll say that much, it’s a new version of Chappell,” says Nigro. “We’re still writing from a really fun place. We’ll see what happens.” (Billboard)
