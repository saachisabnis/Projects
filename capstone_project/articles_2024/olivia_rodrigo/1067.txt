The time-travel slasher movie has a soundtrack full of early 2000s hits
Netflix’s new slasher takes audiences back to the early aughts, and it’s got a soundtrack full of throwback needle drops to match. “Time Cut” stars Madison Bailey (“Outer Banks”) as a time-traveling teen who gets sent back to 2003, the year her sister, Summer (Antonia Gentry, Ginny of Netflix’s “Ginny and Georgia”) was murdered by a masked madman along with three other high school students. 
Directed by Hannah Macpherson (“School Spirits”) from a script she co-wrote with “Freaky” and “It’s a Wonderful Knife” screenwriter Michael Kennedy, “Time Cut” also stars Michael Shanks and Griffin Gluck. 
Naturally, the time-travel horror movie leans into the aesthetics of the era its set in, from the many midriff-baring ensembles, bedazzled belts, Ed Hardy shirts and Ugg boots to a soundtrack full of nostalgic needle drops. From Avril to Lavine to Hillary Duff to Fat Joe, the “Time Cut” songs are bonafide early-2000s chart-toppers. Well, most of them — there’s also an Olivia Rodrigo song for good measure. 
Here’s a handy track list for all the songs in “Time Cut.”
