Cast her in a Frozen sequel ASAP
With reports of the first snow flurry of the season rumoured to fall this week across the UK, there's no doubting it now: we're officially well into winter. Not that my cold toes and blue fingertips would disagree... Brr, it's cold out there! 
While we've been bundling up in our winter coats and layering fleece-lined tights under our jeans for weeks, our favourite celebs haven't let a little thing like the forecast get in the way of a revealing look or two. Yep, naked dressing reigns supreme amongst the likes of Jennifer Lopez in a plunging turquoise sequin dress, Olivia Rodrigo serving Y2K with an exposed thong and Katy Perry's totally backless, butt-crack-baring ensemble.
However, one A-lister who did get the glacial update was none other than Elle Fanning who served Ice Queen realness when she attended the 2024 Governors Awards in Hollywood last night [Sunday 17 November]. 
Arriving alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Selena Gomez, Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Paul Mescal, the 26-year-old actress stepped onto the red carpet looking stunning in an ice blue dress from Valentino's SS25 ready-to-wear collection. The long-sleeved wrap design featured a plunging neckline and floaty silhouette constructed from totally see-through fabric. Sparkly beaded embellishment in a dripping floral motif and feather trims at the cuffs and hem added an extra dose of drama. A coordinating cape with further glittery decoration and fuzzy detailing knotted at her neck elevated the entire ensemble. Frozen's Elsa could never.
Adding extra bling, Elle wore two diamond cocktail rings alongside Cartier's â€˜Mandragoreâ€™ necklace â€“ a green beaded and diamond style with two jaw-dropping pear-shaped green beryl pendants totalling 79.38 carats. Her blonde shoulder-length hair was styled in a bouncy blow dry and she kept her beauty look natural. 
Fans were loving the look, flooding the comments on a post shared by Elle's longtime stylist Samantha McMillen to write:
We couldn't agree more. Winter dressing's not so bad when you can channel a Disney princess.
