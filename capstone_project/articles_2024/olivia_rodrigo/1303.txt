The Celebrity Beat…
Billie Eilish was a surprise guest during Lana Del Rey’s set.  They did Billie’s “Ocean Eyes” and Lana’s “Video Games”. Lana Del Rey gave Billie a major compliment  at the conclusion of their duet by stating “That’s the voice of our generation, the voice of your generation, and i’m so effing grateful she’s standing next to me right now singing my favorite song.”
Billie gave fans back to back nights of surprises – posting to her social media Saturday morning announcing that she was throwing a party at The Do LaB that night. During the party, she previewed three songs from her upcoming album for fans. Billie Eilish’s highly anticipated third studio album titled “HIT ME HARD AND SOFT” is releasing May 17th.
Here are some other notes from the weekend:
1. The big No Doubt reunion went down at Coachella on Saturday, and the band was joined onstage by Olivia Rodrigo.  She did “Bathwater” with them.
2.  Kesha sang “Tik Tok” during Renee Rapp’s set, but she changed a key lyric.  Instead of “Wake up in the morning, feeling like P. Diddy“, she sang, “Wake up in the morning like [eff] P. Diddy” WARNING:  This video contains profanity.
3.  Yes, Taylor and Travis were there… and yes, they were all over each other. Here’s Travis LIFTING Taylor so she could see.)
4.  Speaking of public displays of affection, here’s Justin Bieber kissing Jaden Smith on the cheek.
5. Tyler the Creator’s headlining set included guest appearances by ASAP Rocky, Charlie Wilson, Childish Gambino, and Kali Uchis.
6.  Paris Hilton crashed Vampire Weekend’s set to play cornhole.
7.  Grimes had some major technical errors that kind of ruined her set.  She apologized on her ex-boyfriend’s social media platform, and said she’ll have them fixed before next weekend.
