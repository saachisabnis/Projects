Speaking about the nominations in a press release, Raye said: “I am completely floored to be recognised seven times this year. I was a BRIT school student and I remember how deeply I dreamed of one day being recognised at the BRITs. I am currently a mess of overwhelming emotions and confusion as to how this even happened to be honest.”

The ‘Houdini’ singer was also announced as the first act to be performing at this year’s ceremony.
