You never know who you will see walking around the Sioux Empire! Some lucky Minnesota fans of this huge pop star got a sweet surprise when she walked into a local restaurant in Minnesota.
A neighborhood Minnesota spot got a big surprise when one of the biggest pop stars of the year walked in to grab a bite to eat. No...the pop star is not Taylor Swift. But she is currently on tour and wanted to explore Minnesota!
So why was the singer, songwriter, and actress in Minnesota in the first place? Olivia Rodrigo is embarking on her first world tour called the "Guts The World Tour." While between Minnesota concerts, Olivia ate lunch at the French Meadow Café & Bluestem Bar. Needless to say, the staff was so surprised to see her!
In a Facebook post from the French Meadow Café & Bluestem Bar, a server named Silvia was lucky enough to serve Olivia Rodrigo last Friday afternoon. They mentioned that Olivia was "so sweet" during her time at the neighborhood spot. It's clear Olivia Rodrigo loves to support local businesses like the French Meadow Café & Bluestem Bar!
Another Minnesota company called Duluth Pack even gave Olivia an awesome swag bag!
Thanks for visiting and embracing the Midwest, Olivia!
