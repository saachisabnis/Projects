FOND DU LAC, Wis (CBS 58) â€” Employees at the Sweet and Salty  Pig in Fond du Lac were treated to a sweet surprise on Saturday.
Grammy award-winning artist Olivia Rodrigo was  spotted having brunch with her family.
Two of the employees told CBS 58 they were dealing with a  normal morning rush when a few of the younger coworkers saw a familiar face.
"I knew right away, like as soon as I saw her face, I was  like -- I had seen her many times before, and then it was not long before the  whole restaurant started stirring," said Shianne Lobajeski, bartender at the Sweet and Salty Pig.
Lobajeski says even though everyone was excited, they were  respectful of Rodrigo having her family time and she was kind enough to take  pictures with fans before she left. 
She added Rodrigo was also spotted at the  movies and thrift stores in the area as well.
