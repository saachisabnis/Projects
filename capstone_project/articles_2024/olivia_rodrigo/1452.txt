Fresh off a surprise appearance at game one of the Yankees-Guardians AL Championship Series, Taylor Swift is returning to center stage.
From Oct. 18-20, the “Blank Space” singer will resume her record-shattering ‘Eras Tour’ with special guest Gracie Abrams at Miami, FL’s Hard Rock Stadium.
These three shows are Swift’s first since her run at London’s Wembley Stadium in mid-August and kick off the final leg of her sprawling international run.
If you want to be there to see her perform hits from every single one of her “eras” live, last-minute tickets are still available.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on tickets was $1,059 before fees on Vivid Seats.
While that may sound expensive, prices may drop in the days leading up to the show. In fact, based on our findings, this has been the case at many past ‘Eras Tour’ shows.
Therefore, we’d recommend repeatedly refreshing this link.
Who knows? You just might find tickets straight out of your “Wildest Dreams.”

The 25-year-old Abrams is the daughter of “Star Trek” film director JJ Abrams and a star in her own right. Her song “I miss you, I’m sorry” has upwards of 100 million streams on Spotify, she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the 2022 “Sour Tour” and is currently on a tour of her own right now. Not a shabby track record by any stretch of the imagination.

Post-“Tortured Poet’s Department” release, Swift has incorporated the new album into her shows.

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely over the past year.
Just a few of the most exciting stories we’ve published include a chat with a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, a report on dropping ticket prices, and a list of all the most exciting fan trends.
Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released at midnight (and 2 a.m.) on Friday, April 19.
While every listener will likely come away with their own favorites, we particularly enjoyed the sleek, synthy “Fortnight,” icy “So Long, London,” anthemic “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” bombastic slow build of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and gorgeously arranged “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”
If you want to give it a spin — assuming you’re one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t listened to the overstuffed two-disc record already, that is — you can find “The Tortured Poets Department” here.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (sometimes more!) to see Swift IRL, there are much more affordable — likely stateside — concerts you can attend this year and next.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Kacey Musgraves
• Kylie Minogue
• Billie Eilish
• Dua Lipa
• Mariah Carey
