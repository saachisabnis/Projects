If there’s one place you’re guaranteed to see some unmissable red carpet moments, it’s at the Grammys.
Every year, the awards show gathers the biggest names in the music industry under one roof, and as well as the inevitable killer performances and headline-grabbing moments, there’s also plenty to take it when it comes to fashion, too.
And – as past guests like Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga have proved – the red carpet can be a great place to make a big statement in ways besides fashion, too.
This year’s ceremony, held on Sunday night, featured a host of (mostly female!) A-list winners including Billie Eilish, Kylie Minogue, SZA, Phoebe Bridgers and Best New Artist recipient Victoria Monét, as well as first-time Grammy recipient Miley Cyrus.
Other nominees included Lana Del Rey, Olivia Rodrigo, Janelle Monáe, Jon Batiste and Ice Spice, as well as British stars like Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris.
And while some of the night’s most famous guests (like Meryl Streep, Annie Lennox or Joni Mitchell) chose to swerve the red carpet altogether, others (such as Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Céline Dion) didn’t even announce they were coming ahead of time, making surprise appearances during the ceremony itself.
It was also a historic night for Taylor Swift, who became the first artist in history to be awarded Album Of The Year on four different occasions, following her latest win for her 10th studio release Midnights.
