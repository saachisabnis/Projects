Singer/Songwriter Jewelm, whilst guesting on Access Hollywood, showed her hologram which is featured in her new art exhibition at Crystal Bridges Art Museum in Arkansas, USA. She also made the television debut of her new song, Upon Meeting the Goddess of Love, performing on guitar in hologram form in the Proto M unit.
“I love this technology. It’s from Proto Hologram. It’s a really neat way to be present without being there,” commented Jewel.
Other artists who have used Proto Hologram recently include Elton John, Jon Bon Jovi, Olivia Rodrigo and Metro Boomin. Hip hop artist Lil Wayne is an investor in the holographic communications platform.
