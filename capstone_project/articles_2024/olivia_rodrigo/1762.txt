Project Prom AC is a three-day event powered by Boys & Girls Club of Atlantic City where local teens can shop for and take home a free gown.
As is tradition, Project Prom takes place Friday, March 9th, Saturday, March 10th, and Sunday, March 11th in the upstairs showroom of Kensington Furniture in Northfield, located at 200 Tilton Road, Northfield, NJ.
If you're a student in Atlantic, Cape May, or Cumberland County in need of a gown for prom, consider a visit to Project Prom AC's annual dress event where you can shop an incredible selection of free gowns. Students attending 8th grade dances are also welcome!
Gowns are first come, first served, so it's important to secure your spot ahead of time, but the event is open to the public. Reservations are recommended but not required.
Wonderful! If you'd like to be a Project Prom volunteer and help teens select and try on gowns, it's as easy as filling in your info and availability here.
As an added bonus, visitors to Project Prom will have a limited-time opportunity to win a pair of sold-out tickets to see Olivia Rodrigo at Wells Fargo Center in Philly on July 19th.
