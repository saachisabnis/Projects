The One Day Like This outfit played a homecoming gig at the brand new Manchester venue, which had suffered setbacks and delays since April.
The Co-op Live live in Manchester finally waved goodbye to its woes on Tuesday (14th May), with Elbow setting the stage for its opening night.
The city‚Äôs brand new venue was originally set to host stand up comedian Peter Kay as its first act, but was marred by a series of setbacks and technical failures, which saw them postpone or re-home several shows from the likes of Take That, Olivia Rodrigo and Keane.
Fittingly, Manchester band Elbow were the act perform on the night the venue was finally ready, telling the crowd, according to MEN‚Äôs Jenna Campbell: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs open this venue properly‚Äù.

Guy Garvey and co. went on to play 19-track set, which included tracks from their two decade long career and 10 studio albums, including their latest release Audio Vertigo.
As to be expected, the band - completed by Craig Potter, Mark Potter, Pete Turner and Alex Reeves - ended their set with a stunning performance of their rousing 2008 single, One Day Like This as the venue was brought to a standstill with a singalong of epic proportions, complete with impressive harmonies.

Taking to X after the show, the band shared a series of images with the caption: "Thank you Manchester @TheCoopLive, you were amazing."
