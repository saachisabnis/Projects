In this era of concerts, the fan knows exactly what song is coming and when long before the performer hits the stage. Thanks to the internet, fans know the set list well in advance, which has all but eliminated surprises at concerts.
On Friday night at the American Airlines Center, pop star Olivia Rodrigo surprised everyone, and maybe herself, too, when she went off the set list for a lucky fan.
About midway through her 22-song set, while sitting on a large crescent moon that hung from the rafters of the AAC, she spotted a lucky fan who was holding up a sign that read it was her birthday. Rodrigo gave the fan a birthday they will never forget when she led the entire audience in a performance of the most popular song in the history of the world, “Happy Birthday To You.”
