When you’re an editor at SELF, it’s literally your job to stay on top of the latest and greatest tools of the trade for living your happiest, healthiest life. And a lot of the time, that means testing products—beauty products, fitness products, kitchen products; sneakers, sweaters, blenders; on and on and on. We separate the must-tries from the don’t-buys—and then you get to reap the benefits.
Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days is one of the biggest shopping events of the year, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff that’s on sale. If that’s the case for you, you’ve come to the right place. We scoured the discounts to find items that SELF editors really, truly love and use in their everyday lives, and put them all in one spot. Everything below has been put to the test and earned our personal stamps of approval—shop them before the sale is over!
Beekman 1802
Amazon
One of my absolute favorite hand creams will be 30% off! It’s super hydrating and gentle, which is a winning combo for my sensitive, perpetually dry hands. It’ll be on sale in a range of dreamy scents like lilac, lavender, and honeyed grapefruit, but I’ll be stocking up on the simple fragrance-free version. —Sara Coughlin, senior commerce writer
BURST Oral Care
Amazon
My just-smart-enough electric toothbrush, which won a Healthy Beauty Award this year, will be 20% off on Prime Day. When I upgraded from my old Oral-B electric toothbrush, I knew I didn’t want anything with too many bells and whistles, but was still somewhat intelligent—and that’s exactly Burst’s Pro Sonic brush. It has a pressure sensor, which has effectively trained me not to brush too hard, and several cleaning settings. Possibly the best part, though, is that the battery lasts for weeks. —Coughlin
Hero Cosmetics
Amazon
I’ve been using these hydrocolloid patches for years and they really take the wind out of my pimples’ sails. When I use one to cover a big, red pimple at night, the blemish will look flatter and less angry by morning. I always replace these as soon as I run out! —Jessica Kasparian, commerce writer
Kiehl’s
Amazon
This is my favorite eye cream of all time—I’ve tested tons of competitors, but I always come back to Kiehl’s. It feels super soft, soothing, and lightweight on my undereyes. It’s great for prepping your skin in the morning, since it doesn’t pill underneath sunscreen and layers easily with concealer and powder. This Prime Day, it’s 30% off, so I’ll definitely be stocking up—the price only drops this low a few times a year. —Sarah Felbin, senior commerce editor
Shark
Amazon
Ulta
Sephora
Styling my hair is so much easier and faster with this blow dryer brush. I can dry my hair in about 20 minutes and then brush it with the heated combs to get that fresh-from-the-salon, blown-out look. I’ve tried other blow dryer brushes but this is the best one out there right now—trust. —Kasparian
Youth To The People
Sephora
Amazon
I wrote about this moisturizer for Healthy Beauty Awards and then had to test it for myself. I fully agree with our assessment: It’s soothing, it’s light but still hydrating, and it doesn’t pill under sunscreen and makeup--or make my skin break out. My face also just feels really soft after I use it. —Cathryne Keller, lifestyle director
Kiehl’s
Nordstrom
Amazon
Prime Day is an amazing time to stock up on this everyday essential. I'm the furthest thing from a skin-care girlie these days, but I turn to this stuff as an all-around moisturizer; for me, it replaces a serum, toner, moisturizer, and night cream. —Erica Sloan, senior health writer
Automet
Amazon
My love for Lululemon’s scuba sweatshirt is well documented, and this is a damn good dupe. I might even prefer the Amazon hoodie’s fabric (blasphemy, I know!); it’s a little thicker than Lulu’s. The full-length zipper makes it easy to take on and off mid-workout, and it’s available in a whole rainbow of colors—I’ve been digging the neutrals lately. —Abbey Stone, commerce director
Cozy Earth
Cozy Earth
Amazon
Comfy enough for bed-rotting, but sleek and pulled-together enough to be seen in public—these joggers from Cozy Earth strike a balance most sweats only dream of. Without a discount, they cost $165, which is admittedly steep for loungewear. But today and tomorrow they’re 20% off on Amazon. Or, you can buy directly from the brand with code SELF for even more savings—you can find more info here. —Stone
Dr Scholl’s
Dr. Scholl's
Amazon
I’ve been wearing these white platform Dr. Scholl’s multiple times a week ever since testing them for SELF’s Sneaker Awards this spring. They feel like something Olivia Rodrigo or 1990s Winona Ryder would wear—which I think makes them trendy and timeless. But I really love them because they might be the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever slipped onto my foot; it has a cushy, springy sole that puts a literal pep in my step. —Stone
Hanes
Amazon
My hunt for the perfect white tee has lasted, oh, 12 years or so, and at $7 I can't resist giving this one a spin. —Hannah Pasternak, special products director
Cure Hydration
Amazon
It’s a pretty minor discount, but Cure’s electrolyte packets will be 10% off for Prime Day. I’ll pop one of these in my blender bottle after a sweaty workout and immediately feel refreshed—unlike a lot of electrolyte mixes on the market, Cure has a subtle saltiness instead of an all-out sodium bomb. The lemonade flavor is my go-to, mainly because it tastes exactly like the lemonade from Auntie Anne’s. —Coughlin
Core Power
Amazon
I’m trying to boost my recovery after long runs, and eating right after vigorous exercise can be tricky because…you really don’t feel like doing it. These protein shakes taste just like chocolate milk—they go down so easy—and have 26 grams of protein and lots of electrolytes to help you bounce back. I stopped at a drugstore after my last long run to buy one, and it was $5 a pop; so buying them in bulk (and especially with this Prime Day markdown) just makes it way more cost-friendly. —Christa Sgobba, fitness and food director
Theragun
Amazon
Aches, pains, and sore muscles are no match for Therabody’s Theragun Prime. This massage gun is easy to hold (thanks to the triangular handle) and comes with a few different attachments to target deep knots. I use mine on stiff shoulders and a tense lower back a few times a week—two years later, it still works just as well as the first day I tried it. Plus, the battery life is super impressive (I’ve probably charged it less than 10 times since I got it). —Felbin
Amazon
Amazon
Amazon’s whole suite of products go on sale for Prime Day (and rarely any other time). Take advantage of the savings to score a new Kindle—and maybe a few to give as gifts this holiday season too. I’m a big reader and a big traveler, and love that I can load up the device with titles before a vacation so I always have something waiting in my TBR queue. Pro tip: Many local libraries (including the New York and Brooklyn Public Libraries) allow you to download ebooks right to your Kindle! —Stone
Apple
Amazon
Walmart
I like these because they simply do not fall out of your ear. Even on my longest, sweatiest runs, it stays put (I wear only one when outside for safety reasons). I’ve also never experienced any rubbing or chafing with these. —Sgobba
Nespresso
Amazon
Even on my most chaotic, woke-up-15-minutes-late morning, I can squeeze in time to make myself a coffee before heading out the door with this machine. And I love that it’s super each to switch between having a hot coffee one day and an iced latte. —Kasparian
Nutribullet
Amazon
I’ve had this little blender since college, and it’s still going (very) strong. I use it for pretty much anything you can think of—making protein-packed smoothies, pasta sauces, even soup. It’s ridiculously user-friendly, since there aren’t any buttons or settings to mess around with: All you have to do is press the blender cup down into the base and let the Nutribullet do the work. When you’re finished, simply pull the pieces apart and give them a quick scrub (or toss them in the dishwasher). I already think the usual $110 price tag is a great deal—so now that it’s on sale for just $80, I recommend it even more! —Felbin
Hatch
Amazon
This is absolutely one of those things you think is a splurge-y impulse purchase but becomes a total necessity. I cannot imagine waking up to one of the jarring preset iPhone tones at this point. The Hatch alarm clock lets you customize a sunrise wakeup light in the compatible app from options like "Malibu Sunrise" and "Portland Lighthouse" and also choose a gentle sound to ease you into wakefulness like "Meditative Flute." I also love the sunset function to help doze off—comes with soothing sound options too; my personal go-to is "Drowsy Piano." —Sloan
Amazon
I've recently been feeling like wrinkles can throw off my entire outfit—and with a small baby I'm doing lots and lots of laundry these days. I'd really like to find a quick way to get rid of wrinkles even during my rushed, hectic mornings, and this seems like a great fix. —Pasternak
OneWish
Amazon
I've been looking for a small lamp to put on my daughter's changing table because the light situation in her room isn't great...and it's important to see what you're doing when cleaning up a dirty diaper. This one seems like it will actually be bright enough, and I like that I can dim it when we're winding down at night. I can also envision using it on a bedside table, or even in the kitchen for some mood lighting. —Pasternak
Love Noobs
Amazon
My 6-month-old daughter has extremely sensitive skin, so we use these pads dipped in water to clean her tush. They're really soft and the perfect size—not too big and not too small. We tried a bunch of cotton pads to get here, and I can confirm these are the best. Plus, they're so versatile! —Pasternak
