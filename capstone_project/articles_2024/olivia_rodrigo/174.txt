Summer is the time when the biggest musical acts in the world take their show on the road, but which stars have the hottest tickets of them all?
In a TODAY exclusive on June 6, online ticket marketplace StubHub revealed its most in-demand artists for the summer of 2024 as concert season gets in full swing.
Interest in seeing a show this summer has surged across the board, as music fans from 195 countries have bought tickets on StubHub this year, which marks a 30% increase from last summer.
The rankings were compiled using cumulative global ticket sales on StubHub and online ticket marketplace Viagogo as of June 3 for events taking place between Memorial Day and Labor Day, which is Sept. 2 this year.
The top spot is no surprise, as the insatiable fandom of the Swifties has made the European dates of Taylor Swift's ongoing "Eras Tour" the most sought-after ticket of the summer. This is the fourth time Swift has claimed the No. 1 spot in StubHub's summer ticket rankings.
Pop stars, enduring music legends and country music headliners make up the bulk of this summer's hottest tickets.
Here is the complete list along with the number of concerts for each act being held this summer.
Taylor Swift (37 events)
Coldplay (25 events)
The Rolling Stones (13 events)
Zach Bryan (31 events)
Olivia Rodrigo (33 events)
Morgan Wallen (20 events)
Bruce Springsteen (23 events)
Foo Fighters (20 events)
Chris Stapleton (23 events)
P!nk (23 events)
