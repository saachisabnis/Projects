The Recording Academy has shared that on Sunday, February 4, renowned folk musician Joni Mitchell will offer her debut performance during the award show broadcast, slated to begin at 8 p.m. E.T. While the impending appearance will mark the Canadian artist’s premiere as a performer on the Grammy stage, it also serves as a return given her award history. 
Prior to Mitchell’s impending February stage time, she received a total of 18 Grammy nominations and nine wins, the first of which was in 1969 for Best Folk Performance on her second studio LP, Clouds. Mitchell was also given the Lifetime Grammy Achievement Award in 2002. For the 2024 award cycle, Mitchell is nominated for Best Folk Album for Joni Mitchell at Newport. 
The artist’s latest live music collection was released last July via Rhino and features guest contributions from Brandi Carlile, a producer on the set, and fellow talents: Wynonna Judd, Marcus Mumford, Celisse, Jess Wolfe, Holly Laessig and Taylor Goldsmith. Besides her lyrical delivery, At Newport sees Mitchell pick up the guitar for a solo instrumental take on “Just Like This Train,” which appeared on her 1974 LP Court and Spark. 
In addition to Mitchell, the 2024 Grammys will feature a performance from Billy Joel–marking a return for the artist, who has not graced the award show stage for a live performance in over 20 years. Additional musical breaks are expected from  Luke Combs, Dua Lipa, Burna Boy, Billie Eilish, Travis Scott, and Olivia Rodrigo.
