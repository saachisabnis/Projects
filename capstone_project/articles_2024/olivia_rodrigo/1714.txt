Olivia Rodrigo may have had experience touring around the globe after dropping her hit debut album SOUR, but even she was nervous before the start of her second world tour.
At the red carpet premiere of the Netflix documentary Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour on Friday (October 25), the "Vampire" singer told People how she got a case of the nerves before taking the stage for the first time on her GUTS world tour earlier this year, admitting that she was "terrified" and wished she had gotten in some extra rehearsal.
"I was like, I should have rehearsed more... like I needed three more weeks to rehearse this thing,'" she said. "But I was like, 'Oh well, I'm gonna go on.'"
Fortunately for Rodrigo, she had her family and friends backstage to support her during the big night and was able to share "such a beautiful moment" with them when she wrapped up her performance. 
"I remember coming off stage and my mom, my dad, and all my friends were there to support me and just cheering," she recalled. "We popped champagne. And it was such a beautiful moment. I'll remember it forever."
The "Get Him Back!" singer said her nervous energy lingered in the early shows of the tour, especially when she went to play the piano. Fortunately, her confidence grew as she continued to perform throughout the tour.
"I was so scared that I was going to mess up," she said. "And in the last ones, I feel like [I] could really, like sit into it and just enjoy myself."
