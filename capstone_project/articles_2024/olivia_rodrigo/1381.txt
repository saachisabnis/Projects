The long awaited collab finally happened! Last night Olivia Rodrigo played one the biggest venues on the planet, Madison Square Garden, for her GUTS world tour. At some point during the show, she said “I’ve been looking forward to this all tour. There’s this artist that I really love, and I found his music about a year ago and instantly became obsessed. He’s an incredible songwriter, an incredible singer.”
That's when Noah Kahan came out, they hugged and proceeded to sing and play Noah Kahan's song, Stick Season, on their guitars.
Here's the link to watch their performance: https://x.com/LiviesHQ/status/1776434680650199271
