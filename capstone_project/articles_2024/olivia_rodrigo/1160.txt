Olivia Rodrigo took to Instagram on Tuesday (October 22) to share the initial trailer for her upcoming Netflix concert film, Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour. The film, which premieres on October 29, captures the 21-year-old pop superstar’s recent live performances from her two-night stand at L.A.’s Intuit Dome on August 20-21. In the clip, Rodrigo is shown emotionally connecting with the sold-out crowd as she commands them from the stage: “Right now, I want you to think about something or someone that really just pissed you off. And when the lights go down, you’re gonna scream as loud as you can and let it all out. OK?” The performance features nearly two hours of music drawn from both of Rodrigo’s records, GUTS and Sour, including hit singles, “Bad Idea Right?” and “Get Him Back!” (Rolling Stone)
