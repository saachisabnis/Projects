Taylor Swift had the best selling album of 2024 in the UK, while her fellow female singers dominated the rest of the rankings for the biggest record of this year.
Women topped the Official Singles Chart for 34 weeks in 2024 and claimed half of the year’s top 20 albums for the first time, the music industry group the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said.
US superstar Swift, 35, came first in the list of the biggest albums of 2024, which was compiled from Official Charts Company data, with her 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department.
However, she did not feature in the top 10 biggest selling singles of this year, despite the success of her track Fortnight, featuring Post Malone.
The rest of the top 10 albums of 2024 saw Canadian singer The Weeknd’s 2021 compilation album The Highlights continue to go strong, coming in at number two.
At number three was American singer Sabrina Carpenter’s sixth album Short n’ Sweet, while Noah Kahan’s record Stick Season made it to number four, and fellow US singer Billie Eilish reached number five with her third studio album Hit Me Hard And Soft.
US star Chappell Roan, who had a breakout year, arrived at sixth place with her debut The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, Fleetwood Mac’s greatest hit record 50 Years – Don’t Stop reached number seven, and British singer Charli XCX claimed eighth place with her culture-shaping album Brat, which inspired the “Brat Summer” trend.
At number nine was Coldplay with their 10th studio album Moon Music, which was one of the fastest selling albums of any British act, as US singer Olivia Rodrigo rounded out the list at 10 with Guts, which featured the pop rock song Vampire.
“We’ve seen another strong year benefitting from streaming and driven by era-defining women,” said Jo Twist, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).
“From Coldplay, and Charli XCX, to The Last Dinner Party, and Myles Smith, there were plenty of examples of UK music success stories in 2024.”
She added that the “UK’s creative output and human creativity is being placed at risk by proposed changes to British copyright law, which would allow international tech giants to train AI models on artists’ work without payment or permission, and would be the wrong way to realise the exciting potential of AI”.
“Meanwhile, streaming fraud is also a rising concern,” she said. “By meeting the growing global challenge head-on, tackling challenges around AI, copyright and streaming fraud, and encouraging consumers towards viable models, like paid streaming subscriptions, we can help to ensure that the value of British music is protected and that our industry can continue to grow and flourish at home and around the world.”
When it came to the biggest singles of 2024, compiled by the BPI through Official Charts Company data, Kahan came in at number one with his track Stick Season, while at second place was American singer Benson Boone with his first chart-topper Beautiful Things.
Carpenter featured twice in the list with disco bop Espresso, which spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts as well as winning song of the year at the Video Music Awards (VMAs), and Grammy-nominated Please Please Please at number three, and number 10, respectively.
At number four is Lose Control by American singer Teddy Swims, while Irish singer Hozier takes the fifth spot with Too Sweet, and US artist Shaboozey’s A Bar Song (Tipsy) made it to number six.
Eilish’s Birds Of A Feather was at number seven, while best new artist VMA winner Roan’s Good Luck, Babe! reached number eight, and Dasha’s Austin came in at ninth place.
