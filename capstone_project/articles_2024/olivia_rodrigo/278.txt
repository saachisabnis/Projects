May officially marks the start of Asian American, Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month.
Whether you plan to visit a museum, brush up on your historical knowledge, or attend a local festival or parade, there are plenty of ways to celebrate AANHPI Heritage Month throughout the month and year.
This month is also the perfect time to learn more about the AANHPI community's cultural contributions to modern film, music, and literature.
If you’re looking for a May beach read or book club pick, check out “The Namesake” by Jhumpa Lahiri, “Free Food for Millionaires” by Min Jin Lee, and “The Joy Luck Club” by Amy Tan.
Actors and directors like Jon M. Chu, Sandra Oh, and Constance Wu have spoken about their commitment to AANHPI representation in the movies. “Crazy Rich Asians” is the perfect rom-com to watch on your next date, while "Moana" is a guaranteed hit for family movie night.
Ahead of AANHPI Heritage Month, we compiled a list of quotes from writers, actors, athletes, designers, and activists that reflect the strength and perseverance of the AANHPI community.
