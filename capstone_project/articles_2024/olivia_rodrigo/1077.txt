"You robbed Vini", one user comments on Rodrigo's Instagram post about her new concert film
Real Madrid fans have been attacking Olivia Rodrigo on Instagram, thinking (or happily pretending) she’s Man City player Rodri.
Earlier this week (October 28), Rodri – a midfielder for the football club – was awarded the Ballon d’Or, the most prestigious individual award in the sport, presented by French magazine France Football. Normally, fans react to the results by either attacking or defending the choice of recipient in a vicious whirlpool of discourse.
This time around, fans who believe Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr. should have been the winner have been on the offensive towards Rodri. Except, per BroBible, they’re doing it on the wrong page – sincerely or otherwise.
An Instagram post by Rodrigo, featuring photos taken at the premiere of her new concert film Olivia Rodrigo: Guts World Tour, a day before the football awards ceremony (October 27), has been flooded with comments like “You robbed Vini” or “You don’t deserve that ballon’dor”.

Another comment lends a brief insight into the silliness – “Since Rodri doesn’t have social media, somebody has to take the responsibility”. Rodri is, indeed, entirely off-the-grid on social media, so it appears that Vinicius Jr. fans have taken the post as an effigy for their disappointment and, ultimately, a playground for bouncing a single meme back and forth.
Since then, however, Rodrigo has shared a new post which has quickly been claimed by Vinicius Jr. fans. “Ignore the haters… you deserved that win”, reads a comment by Sky Sports Football.

Earlier this week (October 28), Rodrigo shared about how Chappell Roan has shared with her “so much advice” about navigating fame.
“She actually gives me so much advice on taking care of myself and being me in an industry that’s so overwhelming sometimes,” Rodrigo told Billboard on the Olivia Rodrigo: Guts World Tour red carpet. I really appreciate her. If I give her any advice, I’m not so sure. But I get a lot from her.”
Elsewhere, in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Elvis Costello was asked about the guitar riff on Rodrigo’s 2021 track ‘Brutal’ and that of Costello’s ‘Pump It Up’, and why there was not any legal action taken against her by his team.
“Now, I did not find any reason to go after them legally for that, because I think it would be ludicrous,” Costello said. “It’s a shared language of music. Other people clearly felt differently about other songs on that record.”
