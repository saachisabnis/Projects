Olivia Rodrigo experienced a terrifying wardrobe malfunction during her show at The O2 Arena in London on Tuesday (May 14) and fans were quick to capture the incident on video. According to TMZ, the standout was in the middle of a "vigorous" dance routine to accompany GUTS track "Love Is Embarrassing" when her top busted open. 
She immediately turned to one of her dancers to signal for assistance in fastening the shirt back together. In video footage captured by an audience member, viewers can see the back of Rodrigo's crop-top pop open as she looks to her dancers for help. A few moments pass before one dancer realizes what the superstar is asking. It only takes a couple of seconds for the dancer to fasten Rodrigo's top, and carry on as if nothing happened. Despite minor panic, the "Vampire" songstress never stopped singing, and the dancer did not miss a single step. 
TMZ mentioned that Rodrigo has yet to comment on the wardrobe malfunction as video footage of the incident has since gone viral on social media. Livies backed the artist on Tik Tok, praising the queen for handling the situation in such a calm and seamless manner. 
Rodrigo has three more shows in London before she jets off to Belgium on May 22nd as part of the beloved, ongoing "GUTS World Tour."
