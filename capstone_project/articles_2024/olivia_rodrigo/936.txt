Singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo launches her Guts World Tour at Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert on Friday, Feb. 23 and the Murrieta-native surprised fans with a special treat: limited edition trading cards.
The first fans that get in the doors of each of her North American tour stops will have a shot at getting one of the limited-edition cards and each date will include a unique card.
The 21-year-old Grammy Award-winning songstress also partnered with Crumbl Cookies and is selling fans a limited edition sweet snack at Crumbl Cookie locations near the venues along her tour route. The cookies were served up at two locations around Acrisure Arena including Palm Desert and La Quinta.
Fans can get their hands on the trading cards when the Guts World Tour wraps up at Kia Forum in Inglewood with four sold-out nights on Aug. 13-14 and 16-17.
