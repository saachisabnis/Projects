	The outing includes a planned stop at the troubled Co-Op Live in Manchester, England, which has been beset by a series of false starts and technical issues during what was slated to be its opening month. To date, shows by Olivia Rodrigo and A Boogie Wit a Hoodie have been postponed at the last minute and the 23,500-capacity building originally slated to open on April 23-24 with shows by comedian Peter Kay has yet to put on a full show for a capacity crowd. On May 2, the venue said it was taking a “short pause” in events to “fully ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue”
