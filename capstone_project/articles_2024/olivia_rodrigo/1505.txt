The Tortured Poet is headed to the Venice of the North.
From July 4-6, Taylor Swift will bring her ongoing, international ‘Eras Tour’ to Amsterdam, NIL’s Johan Cruijff Arena.
She’ll be joined by special guest Paramore at all three gigs.
And, if you’ve held out until the last minute to buy tickets, you’re in luck.
When our team last reported on ‘Eras Tour’ ticket prices back in April, the lowest price we could find on tickets for her Amsterdam shows was a whopping $776 USD before fees on Vivid Seats.
Now, a little over two months later, prices start at $275 before fees at the time of publication.
Yes, that’s over $500 (!) in savings.
Sometimes “all of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation” as Tay Tay sings in “Dress,” really does pay off.

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely over the past year.
Over the past few months, we spoke to a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, reported on dropping ticket prices, and came up with a list of all the most exciting fan trends.
Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released at midnight (and subsequently at 2 a.m.) on Friday, April 19.
While every listener will likely come away with their own favorites, we particularly enjoyed the sleek, synthy “Fortnight,” icy “So Long, London,” anthemic “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” a bombastic slow build of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and gorgeously arranged “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”
If you want to give it a spin — if you’re one of the few people on the planet that hasn’t already, that is — you can find “The Tortured Poets Department” here.
The Hayley Williams-fronted pop-punk rockers are opening for Swift from May through August this year. This may come as a bit of a surprise to some fans considering that the group mounted a successful arena tour of their own in 2023.
That tour came on the heels of Paramore’s 2022 reunion; Prior to that, the band had been on a five-year hiatus.
For fans who want to check out their latest, their 2023 album “This Is Why” can be heard here.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (sometimes more!) to see Swift live this year, there are much more affordable — likely stateside — concerts you can attend this year.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Olivia Rodrigo
• Kacey Musgraves
• Pink
• Gracie Abrams
• Billie Eilish
