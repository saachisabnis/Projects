A month of Piano Room performances return to BBC Radio 2 for February featuring 20 artists singing live accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra from London’s BBC Maida Vale studios.
Vernon Kay announced the feature during his mid-morning show on Wednesday.
He said: “Playing a wide variety of songs by so many different artists, from a variety of decades and genres, on my show is one of the many joys of presenting mid mornings on Radio 2 , so I can’t wait to meet and welcome some of them to perform for a whole month in the Piano Room at the Maida Vale studios.”
Helen Thomas, Head of Radio 2, says, “Since Vernon launched his new mid-morning show on Radio 2 in May last year, he has become a firm favourite with listeners, brightening up their days with his warm and funny show, which remains the country’s most listened to radio programme.
“Following his incredible achievement of raising over £6m for BBC Children in Need by completing his ULTRA Ultramarathon Challenge, I know he can’t wait for this next amazing line-up for Piano Room month.”
