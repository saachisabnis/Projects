LANCASTER, Pa. (WHP) — From Lancaster to the red carpet, a local jeweler called MaeJean Vintage is now styling celebrities. The woman-run business sold multiple pieces to the stylists for Grammy-award-winning band "boygenius."
It's a milestone 13 years in the making for the jeweler, owned by a team of sisters, Laura Mae and Amanda Jean.
The band "boygenius" walked away with three Grammys while wearing their unique pieces from Central Pennsylvania.
“We typically only see, like, very high-end designer houses at these events. It’s very cool to see vintage and antique pieces that have been around for over 100 years represented at a show like the Grammys," says social media coordinator Heidi Wurtz. "If we can get our jewelry to Grammy’s week, to 'boygenius,' then the sky’s kind of the limit.”
Lucy Dacus wore a hummingbird brooch and two pearl rings, while Julien Baker wore a nameplate bracelet with the name "Enid" on it.
Phoebe Bridgers wore a signet ring with the name "Bruce." MaeJean Vintage believes she picked it because of her love of Bruce Springsteen.
The jewelry was worn at the afterparty, and a GQ party before the Grammys. MaeJean says its the first really big event they have been featured in.
In the future, their dream clients areKacey Musgraves, Lana Del Ray, Dita Von Teese, Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, and Jennifer Lopez, to name a few.
Seven women total operate the business.
