We’re setting up shop at the Effra Social for a special Bank Holiday event this weekend,  and you can see us on Friday, 3rd May and Sunday, 5th May 2024.
As ever, you can expect another big, free night of fun, with DJs throwing down huge party tunes from the likes of Taylor Swift, ABBA, Sugababes, Cher and Fleetwood Mac, plus disco, Britpop, 80s, 90s and 00s and more!
We have had some record breaking nights there recently– so make sure you get there early or book a table here!
On both nights we’ll be shimmying in behind the decks at 10pm  and playing tunes until 1am – and it’s free all night, so we hope to see you on the dancefloor!
