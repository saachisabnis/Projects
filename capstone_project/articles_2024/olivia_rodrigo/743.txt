Olivia Rodrigo is a huge star, but she’s only 21, which means the last time there was a presidential election, she was too young to vote in it. This year she was jazzed to be able to participate, and hopes her fellow young people will, too.
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Liv says, “It is my first presidential election. I missed the last one. It’s very exciting. I cast my vote [Sunday]. I did a mail-in ballot, and I went and I dropped it off at the polling station. It was very exciting. And I wore my sticker very proudly all day.”
“It’s a super, super important election, so I’m hoping that everyone, especially people my age, get out there and vote,” she adds. “It couldn’t be more important.” She didn’t say who she voted for, though she has used her charity, Fund 4 Good, to raise money to support women’s reproductive rights.
Elsewhere in the interview, Olivia says she’s not in any rush to create the follow-up to GUTS. “I love writing songs. It helps me feel sane and human,” she says, but adds, “I’m trying not to put too much pressure on making something that’s going to be heard by a lot of people right now. I’m kind of having fun with it.”
She also reveals that the artist she’d most like to write a song for is Gwen Stefani, with whom she got to perform earlier this year at Coachella.
“She’s such a nice, grounded, sweet woman, and I think her songs are such guidebooks for me in my song writing,” Olivia says. “And so it would be cool to make something with her … [n]obody does it like her.”
