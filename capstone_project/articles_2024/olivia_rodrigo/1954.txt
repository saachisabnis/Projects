Justin Vernon and co. performed a short set that included 'Flume' and a cover of Civil War-era song 'The Battle Cry Of Freedom'
Bon Iver have performed a short set in support of current US Vice President Kamala Harris‘ rally in Wisconsin.
Earlier this week, it was announced that the Justin Vernon-led band would be performing at the Eau Claire rally in support of Harris’ bid as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate. Now, the band have performed four songs at the rally, comprising of three original tracks and one cover.
For their set, the band performed their 2011 song ‘Towers’, followed by ‘666 ʇ’ from 2016’s ’22, A Million’ and ‘Flume’ from their 2007 debut ‘For Emma, Forever Ago’. They closed out their set with a cover of the Civil War-era song ‘The Battle Cry of Freedom’, written by George Frederick Root in support of the Union and abolitionism.
Before ‘The Battle Cry of Freedom’, Vernon addressed the crowd in attendance: “We’re gonna close out here with a nice old patriotic song that’s been rolling around my head these last months. I love this melody, I love y’all, I appreciate ya.”

He continued: “We’re here for the right reasons and we all know what we’re here for so we’re gonna do our thing, make this music, and make way for the people that we need to hear from.”

Bon Iver are now the latest act to throw their support behind Kamala Harris. In recent weeks, rapper Quavo backed Harris for her commitment to tackling gun violence and running the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which was established last year. Megan Thee Stallion performed at the same Harris rally, and vocalised her support for Harris as the next American President, encouraging her fans to vote for her.
Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion are not the only musicians who have expressed their support for the Harris Presidential campaign. Olivia Rodrigo expressed her support for the current Vice President’s campaign over Harris’ stance on reproductive rights. Charli XCX gave her backing to Harris on social media writing: “Kamala IS brat,” while John Legend called for the American public to “elect Kamala Harris as our President”.
Beyoncé gave Harris permission to use her song ‘Freedom’ in an election campaign video after the VP recently walked out to the powerful anthem at a staff meeting.
Bon Iver released their latest album ‘I, I’ in 2019. In a five-star review, NME said the band’s fourth album saw Vernon draw on the sounds of the band’s three previous records. “Over 12 years the music Justin Vernon has created as Bon Iver has constantly changed, but that doesn’t mean the old sounds have been undone,” it read. “They’ve been repurposed and reused, evolving into something different – but always as compelling as the Bon Iver of yesteryear.”
