On a recent tour stop in Nashville, Canadian pop sensation Tate McRae surprised her audience by bringing out a special guest—country sensation Megan Moroney. The two sang a duet of Moroney’s breakout hit “Tennessee Orange,” to the delight of McRae’s fans. 
McRae paused during her set and took a moment to address the crowd at Ascend Amphitheater, according to a fan-captured TikTok video. “I myself am a huge fan of country music,” she said. “I’m so f—ing excited to sing with the one and only … Megan Moroney. Give it up for Megan!”
Moroney entered the stage with her bedazzled guitar and McRae’s fans went wild. There’s clearly some major crossover in the pop and country girl world. Moroney has also supported Olivia Rodrigo on her tour, so she’s in big with the pop princesses.
When the two begin their duet, Moroney lets McRae take the first verse. They traded verses back and forth, melding their different vocals together beautifully. Moroney’s deeper, more raspy tones work well against McRae’s range.

During a recent interview, Megan Moroney admitted that, despite her new album featuring some love songs, she “doesn’t have time for a relationship.” Speaking with Fox News Digital, she shared that she’s been too focused on her career to pursue love. 
“I think I’ve never been more dialed in with my career than I am now,” she said. “I really don’t have time for a relationship, and I think it’s reflected in my album. There’s two love songs that are maybe kind of hopeful, and then it ends real quick, and that is an accurate representation of how my love life recently went. So, yeah, I’m focused on the music and my career, and that’s kind of all about all I have time for right now.”
According to Moroney, she hasn’t been in love because she’s not emotionally available at the moment. Continuing, she revealed, “I think because I’m not emotionally available, like, I am not ready to find someone that I want to marry right now, because that’s just not in even the top ten things in my brain right now.”
