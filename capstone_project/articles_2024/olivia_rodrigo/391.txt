Chris Martin, frontman of the band Coldplay, fell through a trap door onstage in Melbourne, Australia, during a concert Sunday. 
Martin was reading signs and interacting with the crowd while walking backward, according to video of the moment, which was widely shared on social media. He is seen backing into a trap door, where a crew member caught him. 
"That's not planned," Martin said after he fell into the opening and onto the crew member. "Thank you for catching me." 
Coldplay is on its “Music of the Spheres” tour, which began in March 2022 and is expected to go until September 2025. The band is currently performing the Australian leg of the tour. 
Coldplay was performing its last of four shows at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium on Sunday. 
Representatives for Coldplay and Marvel Stadium did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Martin is not the only artist to have had a mishap with a trap door recently.
Olivia Rodrigo fell through an opening onstage at her own Melbourne concert at the Rod Laver Arena on Oct. 14. 
"Oh, my God, that was fun," she said after she fell. "I'm OK." 
She later shared she went to the hospital to check that she didn't have a concussion. Rodrigo said she was treated by a nurse with the same name as her late grandfather and felt that it was a sign that he was looking out for her. 
Despite Sunday's accident, Coldplay had reason to celebrate during its last Melbourne show. 
Marvel Stadium shared on Instagram that Coldplay broke the venue’s attendance record after 227,000 people came to see the band. The record was previously held for 14 years by AC/DC with a total of 181,495 concertgoers in 2010, according to Billboard.
