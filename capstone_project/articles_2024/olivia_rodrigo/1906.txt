With the 2024 BRIT Awards now only hours away, many will be interested in knowing the betting odds for some of the most sought-after categories.


  Much speculation has been made about who will win at this year's ceremony with RAYE attracting acclaim for her 'My 21st Century Blues' album which was released last year.

  Here are the betting odds for some of the biggest categories at the 2024 BRIT Awards, according to Gambling.com.


RAYE is currently the favourite to win in the Best Album category with the betting website giving her an 8/15 chance and a 65.2% probability.


  The betting firm said that viewers can expect a dig at her former label¬†Polydor (which refused to release her album)¬†if she does win.


  RAYE is also the favourite to snatch¬†the Best Song award with bookmakers giving this a¬†probability of 47.6%.


  However, it was warned that she faces "stiff competition" with Central Cee and Dave¬†also reaching the¬†top of the charts in previous months.


  The site said: "Dave is looking to win his third Brit award while Central Cee, who has been nominated for five Brit awards before this year, is going for his first win.


  "Central Cee has a second chance of winning best single with ‚ÄòLet Go‚Äô, which reached number six in the UK charts.


  "Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding lead the rest of the nominations for best song with their third collaboration ‚ÄòMiracle‚Äô, which is priced at¬†5/1."

  Bookmakers have also given RAYE a 50% chance of winning in the British Artist of The Year category.


  The site said: "The nominees for best British artist shows just how strong the music scene is in this country right now. RAYE is one of the best new acts to emerge in the last few years and this could be a very memorable evening for her.


  "If she takes the British Artist of the Year award, she will have earned it. Dua Lipa has a great chance of adding to her six Brit awards and three Grammys."


  Three music heavyweights are in the running to win in the international category with Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Olivia Rodrigo battling it out.


The BRITs¬†airs tonight (Saturday, March 2)¬†from 8:30 pm on ITV1 and ITVX.
