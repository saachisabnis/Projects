Cool-cool-cool, let me go listen to “So American” on a loop. 🥹
Hi, hello, the 81st Annual Venice Film Festival is here and one thing I surely didn’t have on my bingo card was Louis Partridge pulling up with Olivia Rodrigo to make their red carpet debut (!!!). That’s right—the couple arrived at the premiere of Louis’s thriller, Disclaimer, in coordinating all-black outfits. The Grammy winner supported her man in a semi-sheer floor-length floral dress, black sunglasses, and her signature red lip while Louis opted for a sleek black suit and white dress shirt. Trés chic!
Per the Daily Mail, Liv and Louis made their way through the coveted film festival while holding hands.  
While Livies have been keeping 👏  up 👏 with the pair’s super-sweet relationship since he supported her at a slew of GUTS shows, they’ve kept things relatively low-key since they were first linked in 2023. Meaning: This marks their first red carpet together! The Venice Film Fest was also Olivia’s first public appearance after wrapping the U.S. leg of her GUTS World Tour with 6 sold-out shows at Kia Forum in L.A.
And while her bonus track “So American” didn’t score a permanent spot on the setlist, it does allegedly allude to her romance with the Enola Holmes actor with lyrics like:
We simply love to see it!
