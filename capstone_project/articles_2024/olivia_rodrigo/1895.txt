	The 66th annual Grammy Awards are almost here, and before Music’s Biggest Night takes over the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday (Feb. 4), this year’s top talent, nominees and more will be spending the week celebrating their achievements at countless parties and events.

SZA leads this year’s pack of nominees with nine nods — including record and song of the year nods for her Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Kill Bill” and an album of the year nomination for her 10-week Billboard 200 chart-topping sophomore album SOS. Phoebe Bridgers, Victoria Monét and engineer/mixer Serban Ghenea follow with seven nominations; and Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus, Jon Batiste and Brandy Clark are up for six.

	Highlights of this year’s Grammy event roundup include NMPA and Billboard’s Grammy Week Songwriter Awards and Showcase, honoring Antonoff, Kelsea Ballerini, Jessie Jo Dillon, Dan Nigro, Leon Thomas III and more.  Meanwhile, this year’s MusiCares Person of the Year event will honor Jon Bon Jovi.
