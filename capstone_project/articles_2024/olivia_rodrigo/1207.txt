"That hasn’t happened before"
Olivia Rodrigo accidentally created a very awkward moment for two siblings attending a recent ‘Guts’ World Tour gig.
On Thursday (October 17), the pop star made her first stop in Sydney, and while interacting with the crowd saw two attendees she assumed were a couple.
“You guys are so cute,” she said. “I have a really huge fun thing to ask: Would you guys give us a kiss on the Guts cam?”

When the boy immediately shook his head and explained he was with his sister, the fans at the SuperDome all laughed. “She’s your sister! Shit!” yelled Rodrigo in response from the stage. “Never mind, never mind, scrap that!”
“Oh, fuck, wow,” the ‘Vampire’ singer added. “That hasn’t happened before.”
The fan later posted a video of the moment captioned, “Olivia Rodrigo asking my sister and I to kiss was not on my 2024 bingo card”, to which Rodrigo replied in the comments: “I AM SO SORRY.”
Rodrigo’s current tour is in support of her second album ‘Guts’, which was released in September last year. NME gave ‘Guts’ five stars, saying, “it marks the end of Rodrigo’s teenage years, a moment that has gravity given that she recently said in a statement that she felt like she grew ‘10 years’ between the ages of 18 and 20′.”

Last week, she donated all of the profits from her first show in the Philippines to the nonprofit Jhpiego which works “to ensure moms and babies receive quality health care” (per their website).
Earlier this year, the ‘Get Him Back!’ singer made headlines for handing out contraceptive kits with condoms, Plan Bs, and information for abortion access at her show in Missouri. The state notably banned almost all abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.
The kits were part of a reproductive rights initiative held on her tour, in which the National Network of Abortion Funds would have a booth at every show on her North American leg.
The sibling incident follows another onstage gaffe, after she fell through a hole on stage during another recent concert in Melbourne. While performing on Monday (October 14), Rodrigo ran across the stage to greet fans before being dramatically interrupted after falling through an opening that seemed to be obscured by darkness.
Fans can be heard gasping in clips shared online, but Rodrigo promptly climbed out of the hole and continued with the show. “Oh my God, that was fun! I’m okay!” she told the crowd. “Wow. Sometimes, there’s just a hole in the stage. That’s alright! Alright, where was I?”

It seems Rodrigo found the humour in the fall, though. Shortly after the show she took to TikTok to re-share the clip, writing “I am ok hahaha❤️” in the comments.
The three-time Grammy winner has been on the road since February, and is set to wrap up her tour after the current four-night stint in Sydney. Rodrigo has also announced new dates for her rescheduled Manchester shows, and they’re just after Glastonbury 2025.
The singer shared that she’ll be playing Manchester’s Co-op Live arena on June 30 and July 1 next year, and tickets purchased for the original shows will be transferred to the new dates automatically.
