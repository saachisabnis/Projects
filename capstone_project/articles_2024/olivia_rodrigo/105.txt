Sofia Richie Grainge is the latest to land herself a custom Erewhon smoothie. Lionel Richie‘s daughter joins the likes of other A-list ladies – Kendall Jenner, Olivia Rodrigo, Kourtney Kardashian Barker and Hailey Bieber – and even streetwear imprint Cactus Plant Flea Market in whipping up a personalized $20+ smoothie for the Los Angeles grocery store.
Running for $21, Sofia’s Sweet Cherry Smoothie is described as a “tart and creamy blend” that “harnesses the rich flavor of Sofia’s favorite superfruit: dark cherries.”

The smoothie features MALK’s Almond Milk as the plant-based milk base. It’s blended with organic cherry juice, vanilla colostrum, organic Calm Powder (magnesium) and organic pure maple syrup and topped with organic dark sweet cherries, pineapple, avocado, coconut cream and pitaya powder.
Before Richie Grainge, Gisele Bündchen was the latest to chef it up, curating the Giselderberry Boost Smoothie.
Sofia’s Sweet Cherry Smoothie is available at Erewhon’s tonic bar now through March 19. A portion of the proceeds will go to Every Mother Counts, which aims to provide quality, respectful, and equitable maternity care to all mothers.
