SZA is the most-nominated artist of the 2024 Grammy Awards, up for the big three awards – Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year – among six other nominations. The singer is now also slated to take the stage as a performer at next Sunday’s show.
The decorated songstress joins a stacked list of performers including Burna Boy, Travis Scott, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodrigo, Luke Combs, and, also announced today, Joni Mitchell. U2 is also set to deliver a live performance from a state over, performing in their current stomping grounds: Las Vegas’ MSG Sphere.
In addition to the three most coveted awards of the evening, SZA also lands nominations for a handful of SOS tracks: Traditional R&B Performance (“Love Language”), Best R&B Song (“Snooze”), Best R&B Performance (“Kill Bill”), Best Melodic Rap Performance (“Low”) and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for her duet with Phoebe Bridgers, “Ghost in the Machine.”
