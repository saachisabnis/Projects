Lilly Hiatt will release Forever on January 31, 2025 via New West Records. The 9-song set is Hiatt’s first album in four years and was produced by her husband, Coley Hinson, and mixed by Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Pixies, Hole). Forever is a raw, unvarnished work of love and trust that walks the line between alt-rock muscle and singer-songwriter sensitivity. It is a bold, guitar-driven, exploration of maturity and adulthood that grapples with growth and change, escape and anxiety, self-loathing and self-love, and the songs are intensely vulnerable, full of diaristic snapshots.
Check out the video for the album’s first single, the driving “Shouldn’t Be,” which premiered earlier on Spin. The song meditates on the universal need to stand in your beliefs without requiring the validation of others. Hiatt says, “I wrote ‘Shouldn’t Be’ after a Mudhoney concert and it was the first song I recorded for the album. I was also thinking a little of Olivia Rodrigo when writing it. It’s a song about standing in your truth.” 
Lilly Hiatt’s Forever will be available across digital retailers, on compact disc, and standard black vinyl. A limited, clear green color edition autographed by Lilly Hiatt as well as an autographed compact disc edition will be available at Independent Retailers and can be pre-ordered NOW via NEW WEST RECORDS.
