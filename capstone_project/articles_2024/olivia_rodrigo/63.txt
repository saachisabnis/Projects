If you still remember your MySpace songs, you're in luck. Today, Instagram is launching the ability to add a song to your profile, allowing you to customize your page even further. 
In a true gross-generational collaboration, Sabrina Carpenter helped Instagram launch the feature. The pop star added her new single, "Taste," as her debut profile song. The song will appear below your Instagram bio on your profile. 
The profile song is one in a series of recent updates by the Meta-owned company. Two weeks ago, it expanded the carousel limit from 10 to 20 photos, akin to Facebook albums, and it might switch its grid from squares to rectangles. 
Profile songs are one of several ways to incorporate music into your profile. Last year, it added the option to add a song snippet to Notes and partnered with Carpenter's fellow Disney star-turned-pop star, Olivia Rodrigo, to add songs to grid posts.
The social media platform is also partnering with the "Espresso" singer with an Easter egg to promote her forthcoming album, Short n' Sweet. If you mention any words related to her new album or popular songs, your Notes will turn baby blue. It partnered similarly with Taylor Swift when she released The Tortured Poets Department.
