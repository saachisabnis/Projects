Olivia Rodrigo kept her promise to raise awareness and enhance access to reproductive health care during her Guts world tour. In St. Louis, Missouri, she partnered with the organization Right by You to distribute free emergency contraceptives, condoms, and information about abortion to fans. They received a package containing Julie, an emergency contraceptive, along with QR code cards linking to abortion access resources and the Missouri Abortion Fund.
Rodrigo’s initiative, Fund 4 Good, supports reproductive health freedom and will donate a portion of ticket sales to the cause. Her efforts are particularly relevant given the current challenges to reproductive rights in the U.S., including Missouri. Rodrigo aims to combat stigma, promote access, and educate about reproductive health.
