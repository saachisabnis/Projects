Coachella always tends to be full of surprises, and this year's no different. Acts had more than just music planned for festival goers, and anyone who caught No Doubt's reunion (it was their first show in nine years) was also treated to a special appearance from Olivia Rodrigo. The rising superstar took the stage to help Gwen Stefani sing the band's Return to Saturn hit "Bathwater."
The song choice was fitting, given Rodrigo picked it as one of her top 18 songs in 2021 to celebrate her 18th birthday. She also recently praised the No Doubt frontwoman for breaking stereotypes, calling her "incredibly inspiring."No Doubt's Coachella setlist is full of hits, fan favorites, and deep cuts. We can't wait to see what surprises they have in store for Coachella's second weekend. Watch fan-shot footage of Rodrigo joining No Doubt onstage, as well as the full setlist, below.
