Love may be embarrassing but Olivia Rodrigo has no problem putting her feelings for boyfriend Louis Partridge on display.
The "Vampire" singer and her English beau were seen attending the Manchester United FC match against Chelsea FC Premier League in Manchester, England on Sunday (November 3), but it was Rodrigo's choice of jewelry that was turning heads. 
The GUTS musician subtly honored her boyfriend by wearing a delicate chain necklace featuring an "L" charm, according to People, which also shared photos giving a look at the delicate tribute. She completed her effortlessly cool look with a black shirt, polka dot skirt, knee-high boots, tan suede jacket and sunglasses while the Enola Holmes actor wore a white shirt, black slacks and cropped navy suede jacket.
The pair were also seen getting close during the match, with one video posted to X (formerly Twitter) showing Partridge giving his girlfriend a quick kiss on the forehead and another clip of Rodrigo adorably snapping a photo of her beau.
Rodrigo has been linked to Partridge since late 2023 and the pair even attended the Venice Film Festival together in August for the premiere of his film Disclaimer. The "Get Him Back!" singer also recently revealed the "oddly specific question" she asks on first dates that she poses to potential matches in order to weed out any red flags.
