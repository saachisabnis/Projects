Budget supermarket chain Lidl has unveiled a new travel tumbler, set to rival the viral Stanley Cup but at a fraction of the cost.
Google searches for 'Stanley cup' doubled in July, prompting Lidl to introduce the Decor XL Travel Tumbler as an affordable solution for those seeking hydration. The tumbler, which launched on Sunday, July 28, is now available in stores nationwide.
The Lidl Decor XL Travel Tumbler offers customers 880ml of cool hydration in a stylishly designed tumbler, complete with a handle and detachable stainless steel straw - perfect for surviving the heatwave.
Priced at just £9.99, this Lidl bargain is a quarter of the cost of the Stanley Quencher H2.0 Flowstate Tumbler, which retails at £45.
 Available in four summer shades - classic black, summery mint green, tranquil aqua and lavish lilac - the tumbler is sure to appeal to a wide range of tastes. Olivia Rodrigo fans may be particularly drawn to the lilac version, following disappointment over missing the singer's limited edition release, reports the Manchester Evening News. 
With 16.2 million posts on TikTok tagging the #OliviaRodrigoXStanleyCup, Olivia's Stanley was highly sought after and difficult to obtain. Lidl shoppers could even customise their tumblers with stickers to create their own version of the limited edition item.
Lidl’s Décor XL Travel Tumbler is available to buy now in stores across the UK.
