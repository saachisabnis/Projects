Olivia Rodrigo attends the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.
Olivia Rodrigo and Crumbl Cookies announced a special cookie to celebrate the kick-off of the "spicy Pisces'" Guts stadium world tour. The singer-songwriter, who also just celebrated her 21st birthday on Tuesday (February 20), created a brand new "star-studded flavor" with the cookie company. Her Crumbl cookie is inspired by the color motif of her sophomore album.
The Guts cookie features two chilled purple vanilla cookies sandwiched around layers of triple-berry jam and light vanilla buttercream. The cookie is then rolled onto star-shaped sprinkles and topped with a star cutout. In partnership with the freshly baked cookie company, each stop on her US tour will have the Crumbl stores in the surrounding area have the Guts cookie available for that week.

Crumbl Cookies is a chain of dessert stores that rotates six different cookies each week. Sometimes reflecting a certain holiday or season, the cookie company prices their cookies at $4.80 each. At 640 to nearly 1000 calories per cookie, Rodrigo's layered cookie is closer to the 1000-calorie mark. Since her target audience is teenage girls, their metabolisms can easily handle the sugar rush that is sure to come with the cookie. The award-winning artist posed with her Guts cookie on Instagram but notably hasn't taken a bite out of the cookie for the photo she shared.

As we kick off 2024, many of our favorite musicians are planning to hit the road once again. Some are continuing their tours from last year, expanding dates in cities that have sold out and filling up stadiums for their ever-devoted fans. Gametime has released new data highlighting the most anticipated concert tours of the year based on average ticket price -- and some of the numbers are astounding. It is no surprise that the highest-priced tours belong to Taylor Swift and Adele, as we've covered their past ticket prices being thousands of dollars.
Swift's Eras Tour shows last three-and-a-half hours as she covers all aspects of her career, from country to pop to indie. With her two “surprise songs” each night, fans are always eager to find out what songs she’ll choose for that segment. On top of that, her timing is impeccable for fans “itching for a post-pandemic live music immersive experience.” Another factor is how much Swifties appreciate Taylor’s dedication to her craft: writing all her songs and reclaiming ownership of all of her music by re-recording her discography. Fans have also been buying and streaming the new versions of her old songs and the bonus tracks on her re-recorded versions of her albums. Her tour is expected to pass $1 billion in sales by this March and if that happens, the singer-songwriter will make history.
Then there's Adele, whose Las Vegas residency, Weekends With Adele has reached the finale. With 32 dates, the English singer-songwriter will be at The Colosseum at Caesar's Palace from January to June. Known for spending time chatting with her fans and making her way down to the audience, the candid moments during Adele's residency has become well-documented on social media, showing the fun times fans have to see her.
Take a look below at which five music artists have the hottest concert tickets of 2024 so far, based on the prices of their tickets on Gametime.
