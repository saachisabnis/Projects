Falling through a hole on stage and getting back up to keep performing takes ... well, GUTS.
Olivia Rodrigo, who is currently on her "Guts World Tour," took quite the fall while performing at her tour stop in Melbourne, Australia. Fan-shot footage shows Olivia going to greet her screaming fans as she ran over to one side of the stage, but then, as she's running over towards the middle, she trips and falls into a hole on stage.
But, fear not, the singer is OK as she climbed back out of said hole and proclaimed, "Oh my God, that was fun. I'm OK!" She added, "Sometimes there's just a hole in the stage. That's alright! Where was I?" as she carried on with the show! 
An unbothered queen:
The "Guts World Tour," in support of Olivia's latest album GUTS, kicked off in February in Palm Springs, California, and took Rodrigo all across the US, stopping in cities including Phoenix, Dallas, Orlando, Nashville, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, New York and more, before heading over to countries like Ireland, England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, Thailand, South Korea, China, and Japan. 
Rodrigo has been making her way through Australia over the last week, starting off in Melbourne before heading over to Sydney.
