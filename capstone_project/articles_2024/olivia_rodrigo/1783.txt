Cowboys and cowgirls, come around. The animal print trend is already a major style move, and summer hasn’t even officially started. Let’s call it an obvious extension of the cowboy hats and the country western vibes, but let’s be real, the culture is always looking for excuse to put on a pair of cheetah print anything. 
We definitely predicted that animal prints would be back, specifically for Coachella, a few weeks ago. But seeing the looks coming out of Coachella right now, I’m not ashamed to say I underestimated the fervor. It was everywhere. Animal print hot pants, hats, coats. Snake print, cow print, leopard print. And then it all started to make sense. Just last week, Rihanna was seen wearing the most over-the-top, animal print high–glam diva outfit walking out of The Nice Guy in LA. Cool girl designer Marine Serre sent like a dozen snake print looks down their most recent runway. We knew the fur conversation was happening. There was the Indie Sleaze thing. That is to say, the writing was on the damn wall.
This timing feels a bit kismet, as one of our fashion greats, Roberto Cavalli died this weekend. He was known for his irreverence to manners in fashion and his celebration of sexiness, and notably, he loved and was known for his work with animal print. It’s hard to call it a prediction because it feels more like an inevitability, but I foresee this enthusiasm for animal print extending through the end of year and into the next, as the next Roberto Cavalli collection will likely focus on a celebration of his legacy.
Tits hiked up to the gods, a cheetah print mini skirt, and a run in her tights. Minimalism is out, and true glamour is back, babe. Rihanna’s cheetah print look is so fun and sexy and a definite sign that flirty animal print is hardcore trending.
Of course, a trend wouldn’t be a trend if it didn’t go crazy at Coachella, worn by the cowboys and ravers alike. Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, a celebrity styling duo who’ve worked with Olivia Rodrigo and Lana Del Rey, were all over this when they talked to StyleCaster last month.
Perhaps nothing more exciting than an oversized coat made out of bird feathers. Fausto Puglisi, the brand’s creative director since 2020, has stayed true to Cavalli’s love of animal print during his tenure at the brand. Cavalli once said, “I copy the dress of an animal because I love to copy God. I think God is the most fantastic designer.” 
Puglisi wrote in an Instagram post, “Dear Roberto, you may not be physically here with us anymore but I know I will feel your spirit with me always.”
