Dua Lipa celebrated her BRIT Award win alongside Billie Piper at Warner Music and Ciroc Vodka's star-studded afterparty at London's Nomad on Saturday.
The singer, 28, who bagged the Best Pop Act gong and performed on stage, looked nothing short of incredible as she let her hair down in a sexy red lingerie inspired ensemble. 
Dua's look boasted a boned bask and tiny mini skirt which hugged every inch of her  eye-popping curves. 
She layered the layered the look with an oversized leather biker jacket and slipped her feet into a pair of pointed stilettos. 
Meanwhile actress Billie, 41, flashed a glimpse of her toned abs in a shiny black co-ord which featured a cropped blazer and mini skirt.

The singer, 28, who bagged the Best Pop Act gong and performed on stage, looked nothing short of incredible as she let her hair down in a sexy red lingerie inspired ensembl.
The former Doctor Who star put on a very leggy display as she posed up a storm on the red carpet. 
Raye broke records at Saturday night's BRIT Awards, winning six gongs during a star-studded ceremony at London's O2 arena.
The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada. 
As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
Dua picked up the fan-voted Pop Act gong, gushing to her fans: 'I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I'm standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me.'

A record 98 artists were up for the new 2024 BRIT award, which has been designed by British visual artist and painter Rachel Jones.
The only men to get accolades were Calvin Harris for dance act; Sheffield quartet Bring Me The Horizon in the alternative/rock category; Casisdead for best hip-hop, grime or rap act; and duo Jungle for group of the year. 
Miley Cyrus was a notable absentee on the night, sending her thanks for her International Song win for her smash hit Flowers in a video message.
'Hello to everybody at the Brits. I wanted to say thank you so much for voting Flowers as the international song of the year, and a special thank you for giving me somewhere to wear this dress, she said, showing off her minuscule gold number.

'It's incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.' 
Dua and Ellie Goulding pulled out all the stops as they led the performances. 
Double nominee Dua opened the ceremony with her new song Training Season from her upcoming her third studio album. 
The songstress looked incredible in an all leather look while Ellie, 37, stormed the stage just a week after announcing the end of her marriage. 
The evening ended with Dua Lipa presenting Kylie with the Global Icon Award, leading into the Aussie popstar's finale performance.
Earlier in the evening she opened the show before winning the Best Pop Act gong  
On the red carpet she slipped into a skin-tight leather gown
'Alright I’m just gonna be sobbing with Raye, you did that!' an emotional Kylie said as she took to the stage.
'You did that. Brits, thank you so much. I really tried to think hard about what to say tonight but I knew I couldn’t plan anything and I knew it’d be just about the emotion.'
'For some of you it’s been a lifetime – 36 years and counting of experiences together and the thing that really gets me is the love of music and connection with people … I have friends in this room that I’ve worked with through the years.'
The pop superstar then took to the stage for a medley of her greatest hits including her recent chart smash Padam Padam, Can’t Get You Out Of My Head, Slow and Love At First Sight.
