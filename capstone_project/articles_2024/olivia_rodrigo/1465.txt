Universal Music Group (UMG) is prepared to call "time out on TikTok" if the two companies fail to renegotiate their partnership today.
UMG published an open letter citing "appropriate compensation for our artists and songwriters, protecting human artists from the harmful effects of AI, and online safety for TikTok’s users" as the three key issues TikTok has yet to address. TikTok responded with their statement reading, "It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters."
If negotiations fall through, Universal Music Group will pull its entire catalog of music from the platform. The music giant owns a third of the world's music including some of TikTok users' favorite songs. Here is just a small selection of songs beloved by users of the platform that will be removed.
