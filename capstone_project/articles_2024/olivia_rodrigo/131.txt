Olivia Rodrigo handed out free morning-after pills and condoms to fans at her latest GUTS World Tour concert. The 21-year-old pop star showed her support once again for reproductive rights while performing in St Louis, Missouri, USA.
Fans at the Good 4 U singer's gig this week saw fans receive the emergency contraception bundle as part of the Missouri Abortion Fund and charity hotline Right By You. The free boxes included a 'one-step' pill, known as 'Julie', which is a progestin‑only emergency contraceptive.
Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, the official account for Missouri Abortion Fund said: "It’s brutal out here in Missouri, but we are here for abortion access and hand out Plan B with @TextRightByYou."
Fan account, The Rodrigo Times, also posted a picture of the free contraception, writing: "Free Plan B is being given out at Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS WORLD TOUR in St. Louis tonight by MOAbortionFund."
Fans were also given heart-shaped stickers that provided abortion resource links. QR codes were also dished out that read: "Funding abortion? It’s a good idea, right?"
The move divided fans, with some applauding Rodrigo while others had their reservations. Kay__evonne tweeted: "Olivia Rodrigo passed out plan b pills at her concert and people are losing their minds. Plan b is just an extra dose of birth control lol."
Savehoneyola added: "We love seeing a celebrity who is actually dedicated to their cause and who doesn’t just repost stuff." Sam said: "Omg this is so impactful." RockTheHipHop exclaimed: "That’s clever!"
Meanwhile, KaitArcher asked: "Love the idea but.. isn’t her fan base all like 10 years old?" Another wrote: "Kinda weird but ok." Moment_mirthful simply stated: "Weird."
In 2022, the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade. The move meant the constitutional right to abortion, which had been upheld for nearly a half century, would no longer exist.
Following the declaration, many US states issued bans on abortion or restricted access to abortion services. In Missouri, abortion is banned entirely, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
As for the UK, women cannot obtain abortions 'just because' they want them - doctors have to agree that they are warranted. The 1967 Abortion Act renders lawful activities that would otherwise constitute a crime under the Offences Against the Person Act (OAPA) 1861. The OAPA makes it a crime for a woman to 'procure a miscarriage', or for another person to help her do so.
