I made this blog to keep in touch with my grandma. But If you must know about me, I have two cats, a Wife and i'm running out of room to type... Just...Full Bio
It all start on Friday night when Vont sent me a "you up" text. He got his hands on some Olivia Rodrigo tickets and asked if I wanted to go. Soooooo:
Jenn and the girls have been in Florida for WAY TOO LONG. They travelled down there on Tuesday to celebrate her dad's 70th. Her dad is a retired pilot for Delta, and because of this she can fly for free on standby. The only issue is standby is unpredictable and there hasn't been any open seats on any flights so they are still stuck in florida and I'm a single father apparently. At least Remi and Teddi are having fun :)
On Saturday I celebrated Jake's (Falen's hubby) mom's birthday with them lol. It might sound weird that I would go to the birthday party considering I am not in any way related but that's kinda how we do things at KDWB... Everyone is family! 
On Sunday I didn't really celebrate St Patricks day, but I did celebrate Percy's birthday!! He is officially one!
That was my weekend in five photos!!! Thanks for checking it out, how was your weekend?? Let me know on Instragram..
