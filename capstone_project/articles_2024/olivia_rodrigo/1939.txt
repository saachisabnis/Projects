Chef Tony Messina, who was named Best Chef: Northeast by the James Beard Foundation in 2019 for his restaurant Uni in Boston, is behind a new coastal Italian restaurant opening inside the L’Ermitage Beverly Hills on September 4. At Costa Covo Osteria, the Boston native, who now lives in Los Angeles, will serve crudos, cacciucco (seafood stew), and handmade pastas paired with Italian and French wines. “Chef Tony Messina led the creative direction of the Costa Covo Osteria menu,” a representative tells Eater. However, the chef will not be cooking at the restaurant nightly. 
A more casual second restaurant called Alcova will debut about a month later on October 3 in the hotel’s lobby.

Messina is not involved with Alcova.
