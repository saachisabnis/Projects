Pharrell Williams wants celebrities to zip it when it comes to politics.
“I don’t do politics. In fact, I get annoyed sometimes when I see celebrities trying to tell you [who to vote for],” he candidly told the Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this month.
“There are celebrities that I respect that have an opinion, but not all of them. I’m one of them people [who says], ‘What the heck? Shut up. Nobody asked you.'”
The “Happy” hitmaker, 51, continued, “When people get out there and get self-righteous and they roll up their sleeves and s–t, and they are out there walking around with a placard: ‘Shut up!'”
Unsurprisingly, Williams avoided disclosing who he’s voting for, though he told the outlet with a laugh, “Not sure I’ll ever vote far right.”
He added, “I care about my people and I care about the country, but I feel there’s a lot of work that needs to be done, and I’m really about the action.”
The Grammy winner’s interview was published one day after Taylor Swift rocked the political world by endorsing Kamala Harris for president, while simultaneously condemning an AI-generated photo that depicted her supporting former President Donald Trump.
While the pop star, 34, is arguably the most influential celebrity to publicly endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, she is far from the first to do so.
Olivia Rodrigo, George Clooney, Barbra Streisand, John Legend, Rosie O’Donnell, Jamie Lee Curtis, Robert De Niro and many more Hollywood stars have also pledged their support for Vice President Harris, 59.
On Tuesday, Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, also announced they were voting for Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, “to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy.”
Meanwhile, Savannah Chrisley, Roseanne Barr, Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan and Elon Musk are among those advocating for Trump’s second term in the White House.
