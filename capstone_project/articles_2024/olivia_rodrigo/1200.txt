Let us find out the “Kamala Harris effect” is not only a real thing but influencing streaming data. That’s because Beyoncé’s song “Freedom” is experiencing a noticeable increase in streams after the Democratic presidential candidate used the 2016 track during her first campaign appearances this week.
Just check the data from Luminate that reveals that U.S. on-demand streams for “Freedom” skyrocketed by over 1,300 percent from Sunday to Tuesday, climbing from 16,600 streams to 235,400 in just a few days.
“Freedom,” featuring Kendrick Lamar and part of Beyoncé’s sixth album “Lemonade,” was the anthem playing as Harris visited her campaign headquarters in Delaware, shortly after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. There goes Kendrick again.
As reported by CNN, Beyoncé gave her blessing for Harris to use “Freedom” as her walk-out song just hours before her appearance and has allowed its continued use throughout her campaign.
Get this, the song seems to resonate with Harris, who also featured it in a campaign video released earlier on Thursday. While Beyoncé hasn’t officially endorsed Harris’s presidential bid, she supported Biden and Harris in the 2020 election, urging her fans to vote.
ICYMI, many celebrities and musicians are rallying behind Harris’s candidacy. Charli XCX notably referenced her latest album “Brat” by tweeting, “Kamala IS brat,” which led Harris’s campaign team to adopt the album’s visual identity for their header on X (formerly Twitter). Crossover appeal. That’s how you win elections. 
Other musicians, including Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, Barbra Streisand, and Lizzo, have also shown their support or praised Harris’s policies. We are here for it. All of it.
