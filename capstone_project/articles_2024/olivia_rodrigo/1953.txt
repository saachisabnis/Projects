The Taylor Swift drought in Indianapolis is finally over.
After six long years, the 2023 Time Magazine Person of the Year will return to the Racing Capital of the World when she brings her ‘Eras Tour’ (along with special guest Gracie Abrams) to the Colts’ Lucas Oil Stadium on Nov. 1-3.
And, as expected, tickets aren’t exactly cheap to see Swift perform one of her trademark career-spanning sets live.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on tickets for the long Taylor weekend was $2,040 before fees on Vivid Seats.
Swift’s other Indy shows start have seats starting at $2,082 and $2,318 before fees.
While those prices may seem exorbitant (they are!), we suggest you keep an eye on this link.
As our team has reported on in the past, prices steadily drop in the days leading up to ‘Eras Tour’ concerts. Therefore, refreshing the link in the previous paragraph might just help you land a deal on tickets straight out of your “Wildest Dreams.”

The 25-year-old Abrams is the daughter of “Star Trek” film director JJ Abrams and a star in her own right. Her song “I miss you, I’m sorry” has upwards of 100 million streams on Spotify, she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the 2022 “Sour Tour” and just wrapped a headlining tour of her own. Not a shabby track record by any stretch of the imagination.
Post-“Tortured Poet’s Department” release, Swift has incorporated the new album into her shows.

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely over the past year.
Just a few of the most exciting stories we’ve published include a chat with a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, a report on dropping ticket prices, and a list of all the most exciting fan trends.
Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released at midnight (and subsequently at 2 a.m.) on Friday, April 19.
While every listener will likely come away with their own favorites, we particularly enjoyed the sleek, synthy “Fortnight,” icy “So Long, London,” anthemic “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” bombastic slow build of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and gorgeously arranged “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”
If you want to give it a spin — assuming you’re one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t listened to the overstuffed two-disc record already, that is — you can find “The Tortured Poets Department” here.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (sometimes more!) to see Swift IRL, there are much more affordable concerts you can attend this year and next.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Kacey Musgraves
• Kylie Minogue
• Billie Eilish
• Dua Lipa
• Mariah Carey
