Olivia Rodrigo is donating more than $2 million from the proceeds of her 2024 GUTS World Tour to 10 global women’s charities. The donations are a part of Rodrigo’s Fund 4 Good initiative, which is focused on “building an equitable and just future for all women and girls through direct support of community based non-profits that champion girls’ education, support reproductive rights and prevent gender-based violence.” The 10 charities Rodrigo is donating to are: National Network of Abortion Funds (United States); Women’s Shelters Canada; Women Against Violence Europe; The Pratthanadee Foundation (Thailand); Korea Foundation For Women; Harmony House Limited (Hong Kong); NPO Women’s Saya-Saya (Japan); Aidha (Singapore); Jhpiego (the Philippines), and Wesnet (Australia). The Filipino-American singer performed in the the Philippines for the first time back in October, and Rodrigo donated all the net ticket proceeds from her show to Jhpiego, an organization that supports adolescent and youth health, gender equity, family planning, and reproductive health.
