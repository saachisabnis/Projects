(CNN) — Caring for a family member with dementia can be heartbreaking and difficult in so many ways. One of the hardest tasks may be protecting them from ruining their finances as their condition deteriorates. Research shows that those with dementia often show signs of financial trouble years before diagnosis. Left unchecked, their unpaid bills, gratuitous spending or willingness to give away their money whenever asked can drain their savings and push them into debt. Here’s how you can protect a loved one in cognitive decline from financial harm.
And here’s what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart.
The weekend that was

• The race for the White House rests on a razor’s edge in the final nationwide CNN poll before votes are counted, with 47% of likely voters supporting Kamala Harris and 47% backing Donald Trump. Harris is launching new ads targeting men in battleground states, while Trump will hold a rally today at Madison Square Garden in New York City.• Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s retaliatory attacks on Iran had severely damaged its defense capabilities. Meanwhile, talks aimed at restarting hostage and ceasefire negotiations for Gaza resumed for the first time in two months. Follow live updates.• President Joe Biden formally apologized to Native Americans for what he described as “one of the most horrific chapters in American history,” government-funded boarding schools that abused indigenous children and forced them to assimilate over a 150-year period.• A Florida woman was found guilty of second-degree murder after authorities said she zipped her boyfriend up in a suitcase and left him for dead in 2020. Sarah Boone told authorities her boyfriend got trapped in a suitcase and died during a game of hide-and-seek.• Known as “Queen Elizabeth of Houston,” Elizabeth Francis died at age 115, making her the oldest person in the United States and the third-oldest person in the world.
The week ahead

MondayApple will reportedly release iOS 18.1, the first version of its iPhone operating system with Apple Intelligence — the company’s first attempt at AI. The update is expected to include enhanced writing tools and a new Siri user interface, among other features. You will need to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16, however, to access all the new functionality.
TuesdayVice President Kamala Harris will deliver a final-stretch closing argument at the same location her rival delivered a fiery speech on January 6, 2021, that set in motion the attack by his supporters at the US Capitol. The speech at the Ellipse, a park just outside the South Lawn of the White House, will amount to a high-profile denunciation of former President Donald Trump’s fitness for office and a warning about the chaos she says he would bring to the Oval Office should he win.
Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcaster and former Trump aide, is set to get out of federal prison. Bannon’s legal defense team made repeated attempts to have him released early and moved to home confinement, but the Bureau of Prisons informed him last week that he would have to serve out his full 120-day sentence for contempt of Congress behind bars.
Tuesday also marks one week until Election Day.
ThursdayHappy Halloween! Still looking for a costume? Here are some ideas.
FridayWe wrap up the week with the final look at the job market before the election — the October employment report. In September, the US economy added a staggering 254,000 jobs, blowing past economists’ expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.1%. October’s jobs number is forecast to take a significant hit due to at least 44,000 striking workers — 33,000 of which are Boeing machinists — and the ripple effects of two major hurricanes.
