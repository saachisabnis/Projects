Now lets see y’all praise Jack since he co-produced Kendricks new album 
He did an INCREDIBLE job
Releasing an album during voting?! Kendrick is such Grammy hungry desperate bitch 
You can’t actually be serious right? Taylor literally released evermore around a similar time in 2020. First you insult Billie and now Kendrick. It’s amusing how swifties are the first to hate on other artists for silly reasons but complain about Taylor getting hate.

you clearly didn’t get the comment… it was plain and simple irony. word for word.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
I don’t care. You’re still an insufferable fanbase.

clearly the comment went over your clown brain and you didn’t get the context. Swift and Kendrick are friends. We love Kendrick! 💕 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

We don’t do these fanwars here. Go back to twitter.

I’m slowly starting to predict “Not Like Us” for Song of the Year
Of course it would be absolutely mind-blowing, due to the Drake pedophile lyrics, but I can totally see a scenario where this happens. It’s a successful and acclaimed tune; the most nominated song of the year; huge cultural impact; and is an actuall well-crafted song when it comes to lyrics and music/melody.
It would also mean that voters are finally opening their minds beyond the same old safe-sounding choices. I’m here for it.

While I’m not quite there to comfortably predict it, I can see a scenario where it wins. “Not Like Us” kinda reminds me of how “Single Ladies” and “This Is America” were embraced, despite their non-traditional sound for the Grammys. Sure, the “pedophile” jabs could be a bit much, but it didn’t stop radio from embracing it, or politicians on both sides using it during their campaigns. I still feel like these pop songs could cancel each other out somehow. I can also see “A Bar Song” and “Texas Hold Em” cancelling each other out. It will be interesting to see where the voters go in the general field this year. I don’t think there’s an undeniable favorite in any of the categories.

It won’t happen

Months have passed and I still read “DWAS” as “Dancing With A Stranger” 😭😭

Honey, “Not Like Us” is NOT winning Song of the Year for obvious reasons.  One of the pop songs is winning.  There will be no vote-splitting.

I thought I was the only one 😭😭
Oh Godmani
well i’ve still only heard that dying song in full one time.
