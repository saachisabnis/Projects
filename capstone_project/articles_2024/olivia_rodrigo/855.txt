Many brands simply add a celebrity’s branding when working with artists.
But Olivia Rodrigo has partnered twice with Sony to make custom headphones. After developing a pair of earbuds called LinkBuds S last year, Rodrigo and Sony launched two new earbuds in October that retail for $200: LinkBuds Fit and LinkBuds Open.
Jordy Freed, director, head of brand, business development, partner marketing, and strategy at Sony, said that the headphones specifically target Gen Z based on price point, size, and functionality. Freed said that the partnership is about more than Rodrigo being a phenomenon amongst Gen Z—she’s also a creator. 
 “We work with creators that have strong creative vision, and we knew that she had a new album coming and a tour, and we wanted to dig in over the course of several years to chart how her vision would align with what we’re doing,” said Freed.
