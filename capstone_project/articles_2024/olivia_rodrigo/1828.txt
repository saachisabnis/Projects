At 21, Olivia Rodrigo may no longer be considered a teenager, but her lyrics sure know how to reach the angsty teen within all of us – regardless of age. 
So, with the deluxe “Guts (spilled)” out Friday and her TD Garden shows less than two weeks away, we want to know which lyrics resonate the most with you, dear readers. 
From the laughably relatable “‘And I’m not cool and I’m not smart / And I can’t even parallel park” in her song, “brutal,” to the devastating “So find someone great, but don’t find no one better / I hope you’re happy, but don’t be happier” in “happier,” Rodrigo’s lyrics  have a beautiful way of capturing many of our innermost insecurities, including our occasional “jealousy, jealousy.”

Whether it’s from a song on either of her albums, “Sour” or “Guts,” from “Can’t Catch Me Now” on “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,” or from her time on “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,” let us know the lyrics she’s written that you love/resonate with/just want to scream the most.
