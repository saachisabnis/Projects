After the Golden Globes and the Emmy Awards had trouble with ratings, the Grammy Awards are determined to do better.
The show will air Sunday, February 4th on CBS. Trevor Noah is the host.
But what are the main attractions? Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa and Olivia Rodrigo have just signed on to perform. Those are BIG music stars. Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus will most certainly be next.
Who else will make it to the stage? SZA, Janelle Monae, and Noah Kahan would make sense. Jon Batiste is a certainty.
The show could use a little rock, and some make artists. Usher would be great. It’s his year, with the Super Bowl following in the next week. The Rolling Stones would be a huge get for the producers. So would Sophie Ellis Bexter singing “Murder on the Dance Floor.”
One nice surprise might be MusiCares Person of the Year Jon Bon Jovi. He’s being feted on the Friday night of Grammy weekend.
More announcements coming.
