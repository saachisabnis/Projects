INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Fans of Gen Z icon Olivia Rodrigo will have a chance to shop for exclusive "GUTS" tour merchandise in celebration of the singer’s six scheduled shows in Inglewood. 
Those without a driver’s license will likely seek means of transportation to get to Los Angeles’ Beverly Grove neighborhood over the weekend to not only get their hands on the special merch but also to have a full backstage experience. 
The pop-up shop celebrating the "Vampire" songstress is being presented by Complex and will be held from Thursday, Aug. 15 to Sunday, Aug. 18, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 433 N. Fairfax Avenue. 
Of course, the pop-up is different from the "GUTS World Tour" bus experience with several appearances across Southern California.
