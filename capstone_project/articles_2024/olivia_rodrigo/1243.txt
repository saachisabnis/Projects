Though at first glance, Rosé appears to be wearing the classic Adidas Originals Sambas, on closer look it turns out she’s wearing a collaborative style. Though the shoe features the requisite gum sole, low profile and three adidas stripes boldly across the middle of the foot, in place of the name “Samba,” the shoe says “Sport & Rich.”
The low cut shoe was first released in May 2023. It features the requisite suede T-toe overlay and is lined in satin. It was a part of a series of collaborative collections from Sport & Rich and Adidas which have  included iterations on the Sambas as well as the Stan Smith.
The Samba collaborative style was released in 2023 when the Samba was trending at a fever pitch, so much so that it was named FN’s 2023 Shoe of the Year. The trend is showing little sign of relenting as people continue to wear the heritage soccer sneaker as a walking shoe. Emily Ratajakowski, who is known for having her finger on the pulse for sneaker trends, was just seen in a pair of Samba sneakers last month in New York City. Olivia Rodrigo was as well. The company even just released a highly anticipated style with JJJJound. This week, they even re-released a modernized Millennium iteration. 
The craze for the Samba has caused interest in soccer-inspired shoes to increase five times year-over-year, according to Circana.
