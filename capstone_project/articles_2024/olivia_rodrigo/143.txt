WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Pop superstar Taylor Swift, who boasts a staggering 283 million Instagram followers, publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for President Tuesday night. In a detailed Instagram post, Swift explained her support for Harris, making her position clear to her massive audience.
Swift’s endorsement adds to a growing list of celebrity endorsements for Harris. Pop star Olivia Rodrigo and actor George Clooney have also voiced their support for Harris. 
Conversely, former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and UFC President Dana White have expressed their backing for former President Donald Trump.
However, political experts say these types of endorsements only make a mild impact.
“I think it’s probably a little bit more just to make people who already lean towards Harris or already preferred her a little bit more excited about her,” Political Science Professor and expert on public opinion Alexander Tahk of the University of Wisconsin said. 
Experts suggest that while celebrity endorsements might not dramatically shift voter preferences, they could influence turnout. 
“The greater impact is on turnout,” Political Science Professor Emeritus Ed Miller, from UW-Stevens Point said. “If celebrities endorse them [candidates], they [voters] may then decide to vote.”
Tahk noted that celebrity endorsements could be moderately impactful on younger voters. 
“I could imagine a small fraction of youth voters who prefer Harris becoming more excited and turning out when they might have stayed home,” Tahk said.
Both Tahk and Miller agree that while celebrity endorsements are not a new phenomenon they are increasingly common. While their impact will likely be small, it could still be a deciding factor in this tight presidential race.
“It’s important. It’s not the [most] critical element, but when you’re this close, anything could have an impact,” Miller said.
Miller anticipates that more celebrities will make political endorsements as the 2024 election approaches.
