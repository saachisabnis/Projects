Things are looking up for Taylor Swift.
The 2023 Time Magazine Person of the Year is heading north to Canada for the final nine shows of the ‘Eras Tour’ with special guest Gracie Abrams.
First up, the 34-year-old pop icon swings into Toronto’s Rogers Centre for six (!) concerts from Nov. 14-23.
Then, Tay Tay officially wraps things up at Vancouver’s BC Place Stadium from Dec. 6-8 with her final three gigs.
And, if you want to be there to see Swift before it’s officially the end of an ‘Eras Tour,’ last-minute tickets are still available.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on tickets for any one of the nine shows was $1,422 USD before fees on Vivid Seats.
Other concerts have seats starting anywhere from $1,441 to $2,084 before fees.
Before we continue, let’s state the obvious.
Yes, these prices are quite high. We know.
However, based on our findings in the past, they do drop leading up to the dates of the shows. In fact, this plummeting price phenomenon happened in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis over the past month.
Therefore, we recommend keeping an eye on this link.
It’s certainly possible that you find seats with a price out of your “Wildest Dreams.”

The 25-year-old Abrams is the daughter of “Star Trek” film director JJ Abrams and a star in her own right. Her song “I miss you, I’m sorry” has upwards of 100 million streams on Spotify, she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the 2022 “Sour Tour” and just wrapped a headlining tour of her own. Not a shabby track record by any stretch of the imagination.
Post-“Tortured Poet’s Department” release, Swift has incorporated the new album into her shows.
For a closer look at what to expect at live shows, here’s what Tay Tay played at her final Paris concert at La Defense Arena on May 12, according to Set List FM:

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely over the past year.
Just a few of the most exciting stories we’ve published include a chat with a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, a report on dropping ticket prices, and a list of all the most exciting fan trends.
Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released at midnight (and subsequently at 2 a.m.) on Friday, April 19.
While every listener will likely come away with their own favorites, we particularly enjoyed the sleek, synthy “Fortnight,” icy “So Long, London,” anthemic “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” bombastic slow build of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and gorgeously arranged “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”
If you want to give it a spin — assuming you’re one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t listened to the overstuffed two-disc record already, that is — you can find “The Tortured Poets Department” here.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (sometimes more!) to see Swift IRL, there are much more affordable concerts you can attend this year and next.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Sabrina Carpenter
• Kacey Musgraves
• Billie Eilish
• Dua Lipa
• Mariah Carey
