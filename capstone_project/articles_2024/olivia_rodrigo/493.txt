The BRIT Awards 2024 saw RAYE clean up - and rightfully so. 
The British singer-songwriter led the nominations with a record-breaking seven, and made history by winning a record number of six trophies, including Artist Of The Year, Album Of The Year (‘My 21st Century Blues’) and Song Of The Year (‘Escapism‘).
Scroll down for the full list of winners.
Prior to RAYE, no artist had won more than four BRIT Awards in any one year, with Blur, Adele and Harry Styles each achieving that feat. She is also the first woman to win Songwriter of the Year.
Collecting her prizes barefoot, she said: "The artist I was three years ago would not believe I'm in control - I'm my own boss."
RAYE faced years of rejection from her record label before being freed from her contract, allowing her to keep the songs she had written. She then decided to release them herself, leading to her song 'Escapism' becoming a viral TikTok hit and then a number one single.
Her debut album, 'My 21st Century Blues', was one of our Albums of the Year here at Euronews Culture. In our review, we wrote: "The album boldly breaks through genre boundaries and delves candidly into some of her most vulnerable life experiences. From the global smash-hit 'Escapism' to the emotionally charged, progressive house beats of 'Black Mascara' and the profoundly moving track 'Ice Cream Man', RAYE's prowess brilliantly shines through, proving her to be a true force to be reckoned with. The album is undoubtedly one of the year’s best."
Dua Lipa opened the show with a performance of her new single ‘Training Season’, and later won Best Pop Act. Her third album is expected to be released this year. 
Elsewhere, US singer-songwriter SZA managed the impressive feat of bagging Best International Artist, beating the almighty Taylor Swift to the gong; predictably, International Song Of The Year went to Miley Cyrus for 'Flowers'; and International Group Of The Year went to boygenius. 
Also one of our favourite albums from last year, boygenius - a supergroup comprised of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker - signed their debut LP in 2023 with the excellent 'the record'. In our end of year review, we wrote: "boygenius has delivered an addictive and achingly intimate ode to collaboration, and listening to 'the record' (stylised in lowercase like the band's name) makes you feel like you’re privy to a mic-sharing session between three mates who genuinely enjoy their creative time together."
Kylie Minogue, who picked up this year’s BRITs Global Icon Award, also closed the show with her own live performance.
