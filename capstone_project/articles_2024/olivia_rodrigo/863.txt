Taylor Swift said to make friendship bracelets so that Swifties would make the best ones they could.
Now that the “Eras Tour” is on an eight-week hiatus until Taylor Swift takes the stage in Miami, Fla., that means there is plenty of time to make enough friendship bracelets to trade with every Swiftie possible.
This concert tradition, which has even spread to other fanbases such as Olivia Rodrigo’s, stems from a specific lyric in “You’re On Your Own, Kid” from Swift’s album “Midnights”: “So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it”.
