Joni Mitchell is ready to see the GRAMMYs stage from both sides now.
The nine-time GRAMMY winner is set to perform at the upcoming 66th GRAMMY Awards, marking her first-ever performance on music's biggest night.
Mitchell also has the chance to make it an even 10, as she's also nominated in the category of Best Folk Album, for her Joni Mitchell at Newport (Live) album.
The "River" singer's Newport Folk Festival appearance in July 2022 -- which was recorded for the live album -- marked her first full live performance in nearly 20 years. 
Mitchell suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015, but in the years since has used music to help herself rehabilitate. Her emotional Newport performance was originally billed as "Brandi Carlile and Friends," but later dubbed the "Joni Jam." The duo was joined onstage by a host of artists, including Blake Mills, Taylor Goldsmith, Marcus Mumford, Wynonna Judd, Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, among others, playing "Big Yellow Taxi," "Summertime," "Love Potion No. 9," "Why Do Fools Fall in Love," and more.
The singer received a Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, where she was described as "one of the most important female recording artists of the rock era" and "a powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity.”
Other performers at the upcoming GRAMMYs include Billy Joel, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Luke Combs, Olivia Rodrigo, Burna Boy, Travis Scott and U2. The awards ceremony will once again be hosted by Trevor Noah.
The 2024 GRAMMY Awards are being held on Sunday, Feb. 4, at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET and will be broadcast and streamed live on CBS and Paramount+ from Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.
