While in New York City for her GUTS World Tour, Olivia Rodrigo stepped out for a day with some friends. Rodrigo wore a teal plaid mini skirt over transparent black tights and white socks, which peeked out from underneath her black Mary Jane shoes by Doc Martens. To add some edge to her otherwise preppy look, she paired the mini skirt with a colorful graphic tee shirt, throwing on a black trench and tinted sunglasses.
Rodrigo opted not to wear any makeup and left her brown hair down with a middle part.
Rodrigo’s pals tagged along for the outing, including fellow singer/songwriter Conan Gray and actress Madison Hu, her former Bizaardvark co-star. Gray wore a navy blue sweater over a white long-sleeve shirt with cuffed medium-wash jeans, black boots, and a necklace. Hu, on the other hand, wore a red and white striped shirt with jeans and brown clogs.
Rodrigo’s visit to New York is thanks to her Guts World Tour making a stop at Madison Square Garden for several nights. This marks the 21-year-old pop star’s debut at the legendary arena. On Friday, the morning of her first MSG performance, a 4.8-level earthquake shook New York and the surrounding areas, and the arena’s official X account tweeted, “that was just the earth prepping for @oliviarodrigo tonight.”

In 2022, Billy Joel brought out Rodrigo to join him on stage during one of his MSG performances. Together, they sang his famous “Uptown Girl,” as well as her own song, “Deja Vu,” in which she sings the lines “I’ll bet that she knows Billy Joel ’cause you played her ‘Uptown Girl,’” and “Play her piano, but she doesn’t know that I was the one who taught you Billy Joel.”
