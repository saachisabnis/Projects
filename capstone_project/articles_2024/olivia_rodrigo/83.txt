LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - This election season, more and more celebrities are taking to social media to endorse a presidential candidate.
“We don’t have any evidence to suggest that it’s necessarily changing people’s minds,” Annelise Russell, Associate Professor at UK says.
She says there isn’t much research on the connection between social media and voter turnout. But, celebrities like Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo could influence a new demographic to head to the polls.
“Is it reaching a different demographic? Is it reaching younger voters? People who might not be likely to vote?” Russell says.
Russell says celebrity endorsements can increase political enthusiasm among the younger crowd.
The enthusiasm can impact voter registration and turnout.
“Maybe they’re more likely to vote now because there’s an authenticity that comes across on social media,” Russell says.
While the relationship between social media and elections may need more research, Russell says evolving social media has changed the way people receive political and election information.
Many people rely on content creators for information rather than other outlets. Russell says this can be a problem.
“With social media playing a prominent role in politics, is the role of misinformation and disinformation,” Russell says.
But, she says social media does have its benefits.
It gives people a way to feel more politically involved and allows campaigns to reach different voters.
