Nobody move: Adidas Samba shoes are on a super-rare sale right now. Today and tomorrow, Amazon’s October Prime Day deals are serving up a bounty of price drops on best selling footwear, but this adidas Samba shoe discount may just be the cream of the crop. They’ll only be marked down until Wednesday night — or until every size completely sells out.
Adidas Samba shoes need no introduction. They’ve reigned as the most coveted sneaker for nearly two years; They were crowned Footwear News’ Shoe of the Year in 2023 and named the hottest shoe by the Lyst Index report that same year. And, most recently, Footwear News deemed the Samba one of the Greates Shoes of All Time for its universal popularity since 1952. This heritage soccer shoe has set industry-wide trends, enjoyed countless designer collaborations, and has been sported by nearly everyone, from off-duty top models to A-list celebs from Brad Pitt to Olivia Rodrigo. It’s the unofficial shoe of the people, and you can snag a discounted pair for just a few more hours.

During October Prime Day, Amazon is dropping the price of Adidas Samba Classic Soccer Shoes by nearly 20 percent — a deal we’ve haven’t seen at any other retailer. This heritage style features extra-special details that make it unique from the extensive Samba franchise, like an extended tongue, lightweight leather construction, and EVA-injected gum rubber outsoles for optimal grip and cushioned comfort. You can take your pick between the classic black or crisp white colorways in men’s sizing from 6.5 to 14, but ladies can still enjoy this sweet deal, too. Just reference adidas’ conversion chart to find your women’s size from 7.5 to 15.
One Footwear News Shop editor deems Adidas Samba shoes an all-time holy grail. “Adidas Sambas have a light amount of cushioning that’s just enough for me to wear them on everyday walks,” she said. “The outsole traction is a huge selling point for city slickers, as the rubber sole keeps you steady on slick sidewalks after rain or down steep stairs to subway platforms. And of course, you can’t beat the look of these Adidas walking shoes — they’re best-sellers for a reason.”
Whether you have yet to step into the hype or are looking to expand your Samba collection, now’s the best time to shop one of the best Adidas shoes of all time. But hurry — this Adidas Samba deal won’t last much longer.
