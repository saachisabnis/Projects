The starry guest list for this year’s Met Gala — aka the Oscars of fashion — is shaping up.
Newcomers to the invite list include “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone, and “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri, we hear.
We also hear that model Gisele Bündchen will attend, as speculation will swirl over whether she’ll bring her boyfriend, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.
Page Six revealed they were “deeply in love,” in February.
The supermodel had previously attended several Met Galas in the past with ex-husband Tom Brady.
Rihanna — whose outfits including her yellow fur-trimmed Guo Pei gown in 2015, and 2017’s pink petaled Comme des Garçons number have made headlines at the Vogue event — will be on the iconic steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art again, a source tells Page Six.
At least one Kardashian will be in attendance: Kendall Jenner.
No word yet on whether Kim Kardashian and the rest of the sisters, along with momager Kris Jenner, will attend as they have in the past. 
Olivia Rodrigo, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, and Met regular Cara Delevingne will also be there.
As for the men, a source tells us “Saltburn” hunk Barry Keoghan has received a gilded invite after making his red carpet debut at the event last year.
The theme for this year’s gala, which takes place the first Monday in May, is “Garden of Time.” 
While tickets sell for $50,000 a person, you must be approved by Anna Wintour to attend.
Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez (who we are told will most likely be wearing Ralph Lauren), are co-chairs.
Past themes have included “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” “Camp,” “In America,” “Heavenly Bodies” and “Punk.”
