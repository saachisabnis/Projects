The Co-op Live arena chaos is re-traumatising victims of the Manchester bombing as fans might be forced back to the venue, some survivors have claimed.
Technical issues over the opening of the £365 million venue has meant artists including Take That have rescheduled their shows to the Manchester Arena – the target of the 2017 terror attack.
Survivor Ruth Leney attended the Ariana Grande concert with her daughter on the night of the bombing. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: “We’ve heard that it’s months off being ready, so saying that they’re going to open in a week’s time is just putting more and more people in a state of anxiety.
“May is not a very good month for the people of Manchester and I know [it is] with relief that some people feel that the recent concerts have been postponed.”
Ms Leney, who is the chairman of the Manchester Arena Support Network, added that she would not be able to attend the Take That concert now as it has been moved to the rival AO Arena.
“When I found out… personally I was very upset because I can’t go back to the arena, so I’m going to miss out on a massive concert,” she said. “A lot of members can’t go back there.”
Her comments follow days of disruption at the newly built 23,500-capacity Co-op Live, which is the biggest indoor arena in the UK.
A performance by A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, the American rapper, was supposed to be the arena’s first official event on Wednesday. However, it became the latest in a string of shows to be postponed, including the Black Keys and Olivia Rodrigo following an “on-going venue-related technical issue”.
Future shows were thrown into jeopardy and just on Thursday, Barry Manilow said that he had booked another venue as a “back-up plan” for his upcoming concert, which was scheduled for May 19.
The singer said that his team had reserved the same date at the AO Arena, where Take That will now be performing on five dates next week. The chaos prompted Liam Gallagher, who is set to perform at the venue in June, to quip that he would perform in a supermarket chain.
Responding to a concerned fan on X, formerly Twitter, about whether his shows would go ahead, he joked “gig in Lidl” and to another, he wrote: “Surely they have it sorted by then.”
Oak View Group, which owns the arena, has blamed defects with parts of its ventilation system for recent cancellations and in a statement, said they “do not expect further impact on our opening season”.
In a new statement, the group said it would be taking a “short pause” on reopening and would welcome members of the public to the new arena from May 14. It followed angry fans of American rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie who were already at the venue when the concert was called off at the eleventh hour.
Oak View Group said it was taking a break to “ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue” and added that they “are aware our actions have frustrated and angered ticket holders”.
