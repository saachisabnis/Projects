Kenny Chesney banks his record-padding 33rd No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart as “Take Her Home” hikes from No. 4 to the summit on the survey dated June 22. The love song increased by 13% to 30.1 million audience impressions June 7-13, according to Luminate.

	Since Country Airplay launched in January 1990, Tim McGraw ranks second with 29 No. 1s, followed by Blake Shelton with 28.

	“It’s amazing how slices of the way life turns and the chances you take always hit people where they live,” Chesney tells Billboard. “I’m honored to have this No. 1, but I’m also glad all the people living regular lives got to see themselves in ‘Take Her Home.’ Any time I can hold a mirror up and reflect No Shoes Nation, it’s winning … and this feels like all the people who love these songs are winning, too.”

	“Home” was written by Zach Abend, Hardy and Hunter Phelps. Chesney co-produced it with Buddy Cannon. It’s the lead single from Chesney’s album Born, which arrived at its No. 5 high on Top Country Albums in April, becoming his 22nd top 10.

	Chesney notches his first Country Airplay No. 1 since Kelsea Ballerini’s “Half of My Hometown,” on which he’s featured, led for a week in March 2022. The Knoxville, Tenn., native first reigned with “She’s Got It All,” his ninth of 97 entries, for three frames beginning in August 1997. He also shares the record with George Strait for the most top 10s – 61 – dating to his first, “Fall in Love” (No. 6, July 1995). McGraw places third with 60; he ranks at No. 21 with his latest single, “One Bad Habit” (9.1 million, up 4%).

	Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, ascends 3-2 on Country Airplay in just its sixth week on the survey (29.7 million, up 10%). The collaboration wraps the speediest trip to the top two since Garth Brooks’ “More Than a Memory” launched at No. 1 in September 2007, becoming the only hit in the survey’s 34-year history to debut at the summit.

	“Help” also pushes 8-7 on Adult Pop Airplay and 10-8 on Pop Airplay. It has spent five weeks running at No. 1 on the multimetric Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.
