Will Smith got Reba McEntire's attention with a shoutout that sparked a funny exchange between the two stars. Check out what happened below.
Will Smith is known for posting glimpses into his sense of humor on socials, and recently he posted a pic featuring one of our queens of country — Reba — on his shirt.
The picture was a scene from his upcoming movie Bad Boys: Ride or Die. It shows him and his co-star Martin Lawrence in classic redneck attire with their hands up and a caption that says, "@Reba rate my ‘fit? And I don’t wanna hear any jokes @MartinLawrence."
"On a scale of 1 to #fancy, you ain’t letting me down with that tee @willsmith! @martinlawrence need me to send you a matching one?" the "Fancy" singer commented back.
Smith's co-star Lawrence weighed in the exchange as well with, "@Reba You already know!"
Needless to say, the Men in Black star's followers had some fun with this. Check out some of the best comments below.
"@Reba we need a mixtape."
"You fancy."
"Sing us a little @Reba song ."
Queen Reba will love it!!
The new Bad Boys movie shows the comedic two on a mission to clear the name of their former police captain. The end of the trailer shows Smith wearing the Country Queen's face on a shirt in a scene where he and Lawrence are trying to steal some disguises from a couple of rednecks. Watch the hilarious exchange in the trailer above.
Bad Boys: Ride or Die is scheduled to open in theaters on June 7.
Will we see another surprising collab come out of this?? Who knows! Recently, Post Malone has done a few country songs with artists such as Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs. Beyonce has topped the charts recently with her "Texas Hold Em" hit. We have seen lots of success before with artists such as Bebe Rexha. Who knows, Will Smith might be next!
