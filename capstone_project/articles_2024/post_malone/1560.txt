The first official release of Travis Scott’s 2014 mixtape, Days Before Rodeo, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart this week. Scott’s collection vaults to the top of the charts from its previous ranking of No. 106, after 149,000 vinyl editions of the album that were sold exclusively by the artist’s webstore shipped to customers. Elsewhere in the Billboard 200 Top 5, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet slips a spot to No. 2, Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess sticks at No. 3, Post Malone’s F-1 Trillion drops two slots to No.4, and Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time drops a spot to No. 5. Taylor Swift’s former No. 1 album, The Tortured Poets Department, drops out of the Top 5 to No. 6., while Eminem’s onetime chart-topper, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), made a strong return to the top 10, jumping from No. 42 to No. 7 following its CD release and deluxe reissue.
