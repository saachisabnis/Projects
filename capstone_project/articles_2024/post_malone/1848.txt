Aug. 23 (UPI) -- Lainey Wilson released Whirlwind, her fifth studio album, on Friday.
"I've grown so much in the past few years and I have such a different view of love and life and loss," the 32-year-old country singer said of her new album. "The highs and lows of the whirlwind have taught me a lot about what's important and how to never give up on trying to find your inner peace."

Wilson is currently on her Country's Cool Again tour, which concludes in November.
"Country's Cool Again" is the second song on her 14-track record. Other songs include "Good Horses" with Miranda Lambert and "Broken Hearts Still Beat."
