Last night was Bobby Bones & The Raging Idiots  7th Million Dollar Show benefiting St. Jude. The lineup for this year’s show included Sam Hunt, Jon Pardi, Megan Moroney, Nate Smith, Ben Rector, Mat Kearney, Ian Munsick, Edwin McCain as well as appearances from special guests Turnpike Troubadours, LIT and Post Malone!
They had been working really hard on getting Post Malone but didn’t know if it was going to happen. The morning of the show they were 99% sure he was going to show up and his security had a meeting at The Ryman. Five songs before the show was set to be over, Bones got confirmation Post Malone was there and rehearsing backstage. Bones talked to him before he went on stage and said he was the nicest man and saw him sitting on the toilet with the lid closed practicing with Ernest. Then he went back on stage and announced the surprise artist, Post Malone. The whole place erupted and was shocked. Post Malone first played a Hank Williams Jr. song and then his new single.  
After the show, Post Malone stayed on the stage and spent 25 minutes talking to fans who stayed. He even laid down on the stage to take pictures with people. When he left, he also spent 30 minutes taking pictures with people in the alley behind the venue. Bones was shocked that he actually showed up, how welcoming and nice he was and made note that he smelled really good!
