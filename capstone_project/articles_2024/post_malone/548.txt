Post Malone, who recently put out his first country album, brought his F1 Trillion Tour to Maine Savings Amphitheater. 
Joining him was the band The Fools For You helping to perform a ‘collection of country songs’ at Monday night’s sold-out concert.
Special guests Dan Spencer and Muscadine Bloodline were on hand to help warm the crowd up.
