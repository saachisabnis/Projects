Full Bio
Post Malone has covered a LOT of ground on his journey to "figure out who he is."
He went from playing "Guitar Hero", to learning the actual guitar and songwriting. He went from rap to country and he went from a spiral of loneliness to TENS OF MILLIONS of followers on social media.
In an interview with "CBS Sunday Morning", Post says, "[It was] gettin' up, havin' a good cry, drinkin', and then goin' living your life. And then whenever you go lay down, drinkin' some more and having a good cry.
"And just like, 'I gotta wake up tomorrow and do this again.' [But] I don't feel like that anymore. And it's the most amazing thing."
That sounds sad- but Post says that he "needed" that, to figure out who he was, and to reach the place he is now.
And now that his fans have helped him break through that cycle of loneliness, he wants to make sure THEY'RE feeling the love too.
He says, quote, "I don't want people to feel how I've felt. And I know they do. And I'm here, and I'm on stage, and I just want everyone to feel welcome and to feel loved. And that's the most important thing for me."
