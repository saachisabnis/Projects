Taking to X to joke with fans on Sunday (September 1), the “Old Town Road” creator asked for the same-sex equivalent to popular eye candy like Lori Harvey and the Clermont Twins.

Lil Nas X gave country music a new identity with his breakthrough hit “Old Town Road” back in 2019, but he still wishes that stakeholders of the genre gave him his props.
In light of Beyoncé‘s recent success with Cowboy Carter, the 25-year-old rapper and singer reflected on his song not being included on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart due to, according to those in charge, the fact that it did not “embrace enough elements of today’s country music.”

Though he is “happy” for Bey having received the recognition he didn’t, the Georgia native admitted in a May interview with BBC: “I wish this would have happened for me. I wasn’t even able to experience this.”
Nas X intentionally debuted “Old Town Road” as a country song, listing it as such on his SoundCloud and iTunes.
