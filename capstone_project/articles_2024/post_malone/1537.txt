Classic court documents reveal a number of alternative names

It‚Äôs been revealed that Donkey Kong almost had a very different name.
According to court documents, the Nintendo legend was almost called ‚ÄúKong Dong‚Äù.
Other potential names for Donkey Kong included Funny Kong, Kong the Kong, Jack Kong, Funky Kong, Bill Kong, Steel Kong, Giant Kong, Big Kong, Kong Down, Mr Kong, Custom Kong, Kong Chase, Kong Boy, Kong Man, Kong Fighter, Wild Kong, Rookie Kong and Kong Holiday.
Before settling on the name "Donkey Kong," Nintendo considered a ton of other ideas.

The court documents were originally filed in 1983 as part of a dispute between Nintendo and Universal, who were suing the gaming giant for allegedly copying King Kong to create Donkey Kong for the 1981 arcade game of the same name.
The documents were uploaded by gaming historian Norman Caruso in 2020, but have recently resurfaced thanks to a X post by Supper Mario Broth.
The courts eventually sided with Nintendo in the dispute, claiming that Donkey Kong was at best a parody of King Kong. ‚ÄúThe farcical, childlike and nonsexual Donkey Kong creates a humorous impression by jumping up and down and strutting back and forth to tease Mario,‚Äù the judge explained.
‚ÄúThe Donkey Kong gorilla is thus quite different from King Kong, a ferocious gorilla in quest of a beautiful woman who goes on rampages, chases people, crushes them underfoot, or throws them to the ground, and fights with dinsosaurs, giant snakes, airplanes and helicopters, all culminating in his tragic and bloody death.‚Äù
This is fun. Judge Sweet declared Donkey Kong & King Kong were very different. One reason? Donkey Kong was "nonsexual." pic.twitter.com/pfZ0YGgwbQ
