Blake Shelton Las Vegas Residency Dates:
Shelton announced six shows, but country fans have learned there is always the potential for more. Brooks' Plus One residency continues to be extended and across town, Carrie Underwood's Reflections residency was just stretched into 2025.
Right now, Shelton's residency dates are Feb. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14 and 15.
In January, Shelton opened a Las Vegas location of Ole Red, his restaurant and honky-tonk partnership with Opry Entertainment.
Wife Gwen Stefani is no stranger to Vegas, as she hosted the Just a Girl residency at the Zappos Theater until 2021.
Details of what Shelton will perform have not been revealed, but it'd surprise nobody if the couple shared the stage together for one of their hit duets.
Right now, these are the only six performances on Shelton's 2025 tour calendar.
