This is awesome. I love seeing Fenway recognize powerful women, especially those in my industry. Alex Cooper has made a huge name for herself just by being, well, herself. She's everything I stand for, and it's so fun to watch her grow. For those of you who don't know the anomaly that is "Father Cooper", she started out on a podcast that aired for Barstool Sports, and now, you can find her exclusively on Spotify. Her brand became so big that she was able to branch off on her own and create her own reality. It's inspiring, it's bold, and it's badass.
The podcast host of Call Her Daddy hails from Newton, Pennsylvania, and according to nationaltoday.com, she was a soccer star who studied at Boston University. Her roots in Beantown made her even more excited when Fenway asked her to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Red Sox game in late June.

The cool thing is, if you buy a ticket to "Big Al's Takeover", you'll also get a limited-edition "unwell" Red Sox jersey. According to mlb.com, Cooper will be at Fenway Park earlier before the game to hang out with fans on the Sam Adam's deck. Click here for tickets before they sell out!
