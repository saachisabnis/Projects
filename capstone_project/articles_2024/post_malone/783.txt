Post Malone’s highly-anticipated first country record, F-1 Trillion, debute at No. 1 on this week’s Billboard 200 albums chart. Posty’s guest-star filled country album is the third No. 1 of his career, joining Hollywood’s Bleeding which topped the charts for five weeks in 2019, and Beerbongs & Bentleys which was No. 1 for three weeks in 2018. F-1 Trillion also sits at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums, Top Streaming Albums, and Top Album Sales charts for the week. F-1 Trillion was the only debut to crack the Billboard 200 Top 10 this week, with the rest of the Top 5 rounded out by Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess holding firm at No. 2, Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department dropping from No. 1 to No. 3, Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moving down one spot to No. 4, and Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft slipping one spot to No. 5.
