Located in one of the most prestigious areas of south Belfast, 5 Malone Park — known as Dracones — is a six-bedroom detached Victorian residence that is now on the market for offers around £1.5m.
Situated in a postcode revered for its tree-lined grandeur, privacy, period properties and proximity to schools and local amenities, this home — which boasts four reception rooms — is an elegant three-storey property built in the late 19th century. For those who love period details, Dracones has retained many of the features of Victorian architecture.
Situated within a conservation area — designated since 1993 — this residence has been home to a number of industrialists, Parliamentarians and public figures over the years and many have interesting stories.

Being a tree-lined private avenue, it had its own role during WW2 when the extensive leaf foliage provided cover and storage for American military matériel in the preparations for D Day landings in 1944.
No 5 Malone Park was acquired in the 1930s by Sir Wilson Hungerford, a senator in the then Northern Ireland Parliament. From 1957 it has been the family home for three generations. Since the current family acquired the property, several additions and alterations have been made. Even though the house has undergone some improvements, it has been done in a sympathetic way, with plentiful Victorian joinery, coving and picture rails still in situ.
On approach, the property has a red brick exterior under a Welsh slate roof, which was re-roofed and closed-cell rigid insulated in 2009.

Inside are very well-proportioned rooms with high ceilings, with notably the ground and first floors both having tall windows that allow natural light to flood in the living spaces — which all add to the home’s special ambience.
The heart of the home is a south-facing living/kitchen area with a ‘Jøtul’ Norwegian wood-burning stove and bright windows that create a comfortable space. Ideal for practical family living, there is a separate utility room at the rear.

The property’s upper floors are accessed by a graceful ‘concealed’ staircase with a mahogany bannister and newel post, which lead to three double bedrooms and a single bedroom on the first floor, the principal fully plumbed for an ensuite.
Meanwhile, the second floor contains two further large double bedrooms. Outside within the residence’s grounds, there is a mature garden which includes multiple areas that catch the sun — perfect for entertaining in the lighter months. Lawns are bordered by flower beds and hedging, and to the rear, there is a very large garage, a sunroom and a boiler house/potting shed that is accessed directly from the patio.

Within the area itself, the property is within walking distance of many leading primary and secondary schools — along with all the amenities of the nearby Lisburn Road — from restaurants to boutiques.
