Home » Jason Aldean Praises Post Malone’s Country Authenticity, Would Love To Work With Him
In a new interview with Audacy’s Dina B., Jason Aldean voiced his support for Post Malone’s recent country crossover. And the country superstar also went on to say that he would love to eventually work with Posty someday soon. “I think you can go back and look at interviews I’ve done for years sayin’ that I’d love to do something with him,” Aldean said, when he was asked if he’d ever consider a collaboration with Post Malone. “I kind of compare him to Kid Rock in the sense of, he came from more of that Pop world and I think he’s authentic to Country. I think Country music fans see that and they understand that he actually is a fan and he does love this genre and I think they’ll accept him for that. I think they’re already doin’ that. What he’s doin’ with bein’ involved in Nashville and the community and the music and everything here — I think Nashville will definitely accept him with open arms.” (Audacy)
