On Tuesday night (July 16), Post Malone took over Music City during his A Night in Nashville show at Marathon Music Works. Posty partnered with Bud Light to put on the intimate concert, which also featured a slew of special guests, including Hardy, Joe Nichols, and Sierra Ferrell. But the biggest guest appearance of the night came from Blake Shelton, who performed his new hit collaboration with Post Malone, “Pour Me A Drink,” as well as dueting together on Shelton’s 2004 platinum-selling No. 1 country hit, “Some Beach.” “It’s a Post Malone world we’re living in!” Shelton said as he took the stage and gave Posty a big hug. Shelton’s superstar wife, Gwen Stefani, was side stage supporting her husband, proudly sharing videos of the performance on her Instagram stories. Post Malone treated fans to a variety of new songs from his upcoming album, F-1 Trillion, which is set to be released on August 16. (People)
