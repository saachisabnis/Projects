Beyoncé's country album Cowboy Carter was expected to make waves, but no one could have predicted her song "Levii's Jeans" — featuring Post Malone — would give the actual Levi's brand such a big boost.
According to numbers from the retail data company Pass_By, Levi's has seen a substantial uptick in foot traffic in their brick-and-mortar stores.
Following the release of Cowboy Carter, store visits for the brand are up a whopping 19.87 percent compared to previous years. It's for this reason Levi's stock price has also increased.
"Amidst a digital shopping era, the tangible experiences offered by physical stores, when amplified by cultural icons like Beyoncé, become not just relevant but vital," James Ewen, VP of Marketing at Pass_By, notes.
"This isn't just a spike in foot traffic; it's a cultural movement, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between celebrity influence and retail dynamism."
In other words, Beyoncé has demonstrated that someone with her type of global appeal can namedrop a brand and almost immediately alter the shopping behavior of her fans.
Pass_By is an AI-powered company that collects data for retail businesses. For Levi's, they gathered information about foot traffic in their physical stores using in-store sensors. In a digital shopping world, this information can help brands better understand which locations are performing better than others.
Beyoncé released her country-inspired project Cowboy Carter on March 29. She first teased the project during Super Bowl 58 and dropped two surprise songs, "Texas Hold 'Em" and "16 Carriages," during the broadcast.
The collection of songs includes several collaborations: In addition to Post Malone, she worked with Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus and more. She also included a new version of Parton's "Jolene," which takes a more aggressive approach to the cheating song.
