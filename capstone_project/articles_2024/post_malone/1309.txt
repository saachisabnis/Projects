Jason Aldean is the latest country star to talk about Post Malone getting into the country genre. Post Malone is doing a country album full of collaborations with Morgan Wallen, Blake Shelton, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Combs.
Jason said in a recent interview about Malone having a hit with Morgan Wallen, "You can tell when something's real. With him, we can see it's an influence. Country fans don't accept everyone, but with him, they have. You can't fool them. They know what's authentic."
In the same interview, Aldean shared some facts about his recent Europen trip with his wife Brittany. he said the trip was "fun," and the couple went to Switzerland, and Italy, and it was the first time he went there. He noted that Italy was his favorite stop saying he "loved the culture" and the food.
While in Switzerland, Jason's wife, Brittany, broke her hand. He explained that when they were getting off a train, she fell, pulled her pinkie at a 90-degree angle, and "broke some bones." Aldean added that she did not have surgery, is wearing a brace, and is "a trooper."
Jason's "Highway Desperado Tour," which kicked off in May, will wrap up in his hometown of Macon, Georgia, in October. He said that "typically we play Atlanta," but this year, Atlanta's not on the schedule. In Macon, they have a new amphitheater that he wants to "try it out." He also likes the fact that he has a lot of family in Macon that they can see while there.
