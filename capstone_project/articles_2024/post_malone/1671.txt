In an unprecedented move that sets a new standard for live music events, Rolling Loud, the globe’s premier hip hop festival, joins forces with STIIIZY, a leader in the cannabis lifestyle brand sector, to introduce a collaborative venture that promises to redefine the festival landscape. Scheduled for March 15-17th, 2024, in California, this collaboration is not just a meeting of minds but a fusion of cultures, celebrating the best of hip hop and cannabis innovation.
A Fusion of Music and Cannabis Culture
At the heart of this collaboration is the launch of an exclusive four-piece product line, available at STIIIZY retailers starting February 23, well ahead of the festival.
This product range is designed to enhance the festival-going experience, offering attendees a taste of STIIIZY’s premium cannabis products, including the “Rockstar Zlushie” and “Rolling Loud OG” strains, and the unique “Live Resin Liquid Diamond Pods.”
Moreover, the festival grounds will house a 40-foot cannabis cultivation replica adjacent to the main stage, offering festival-goers a unique immersion into the cannabis cultivation process. This installation not only brings the essence of STIIIZY’s cultivation expertise to the forefront but also integrates it seamlessly with the live performance experience, allowing attendees to engage with both elements in a holistic manner.
Exclusive Offerings and Interactive Experiences
Adding to the allure, this collaboration introduces an enclosed VIP section for artists, an interactive photo booth for attendees, and limited-edition merchandise, making the festival experience even more memorable. These exclusive offerings underscore the commitment of both brands to providing an unparalleled experience that celebrates the intersection of hip hop culture and cannabis lifestyle.
Tariq Cherif, Co-Founder of Rolling Loud, emphasizes the synergy between the two brands, stating, “Celebrating hip-hop culture is at the heart of this collaboration… We’re proud to showcase that through this collaboration.” This sentiment is echoed in the exclusive product drops and the immersive cultivation experience, illustrating a shared vision for innovation and cultural celebration.
A Lineup That Speaks Volumes
The festival boasts a stellar lineup, headlined by heavyweights such as ¥$ (Ye + Ty Dolla $ign), Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, and Future X Metro Boomin, among other notable names in the rap industry. Set against the backdrop of Hollywood Park, adjacent to the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA, Rolling Loud California is poised to deliver an unforgettable experience that goes beyond music to encapsulate a lifestyle.
A Milestone Collaboration
This collaboration marks a first for both Rolling Loud and STIIIZY, as well as the live hip hop music industry at large. By bridging the gap between cannabis culture and hip hop music, this partnership not only sets a new precedent for festival experiences but also celebrates the shared passions and lifestyles of their communities.
