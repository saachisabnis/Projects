Post Malone’s long-awaited debut country album, F-1 Trillion, finally dropped on Friday (August 16). But Posty wasn’t done sharing new music with his fans, as he surprise released,  F-1 Trillion: Long Bed, an extended version of his new album featuring an additional nine songs. While the main album is filled with high-profile collaborations with A-list country artists like Morgan Wallen, Lainey Wilson, Blake Shelton, Brad Paisley, Luke Combs, and Dolly Parton, the nine new additional songs are all solo recordings. 
The new songs include standouts like “Killed a Man,” “Back to Texas,” “Go to Hell,” and “Two Hearts.” The release of his new album along with the F-1 Trillion: Long Bed extended version follows on the heels of Post Malone’s superlative debut at the Grand Ole Opry last week. The country superstar shared an Instagram reel that captured an intimate look behind-the-scenes at the rehearsals leading up to his magical big night, with Posty appreciatively captioning the clip, “@opry I am absolutely speechless ❤️” (Billboard)
