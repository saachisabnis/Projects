We start by addressing the noise being made outside the studio due to our broken A/C. We play the What Celeb is Older Game? Bobby talks about his experience with Post Malone. We learn a lot about celebrities' ages. Bobby talks about how he has no Halloween plans and how Eddie has been sick but still coming into work. We then get into a school teaching scandal and the origin of burning the boats.
