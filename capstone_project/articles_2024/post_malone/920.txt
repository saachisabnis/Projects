During Megan Moroney's recent show in Birmingham, England, she handled an unruly fan with a quick flip of the middle finger.
It all started while the singer was performing "28th of June," one of the ballads on her new album, Am I Okay?. Someone in the crowd threw a hat onstage, nearly hitting her, and she was visibly startled as she jumped away from the flying object.
Moroney quickly recovered, and didn't miss so much as a line in the song. But later on, she expressed her feelings to the offending concertgoer, subtly flipping them off in the middle of another new song, "Hope You're Happy."
One concertgoer recorded the interaction across two separate TikTok posts, writing in the second one, "Watch Megan Moroney flip off Birmingham crowd!"
The singer herself chimed in in the comments section to set the record straight, and clarify that she wasn't flipping off the whole crowd â€” just the one concertgoer who'd thrown a hat at her.
"Weird way to title this vid & not include context," she notes. "A guy threw a hat at me & it scared the hell out of me. I gave a ðŸ–•when he was getting kicked out & continued to be obnoxious. Hope this helps!"
Moroney will continue her overseas dates in the U.K., Scandinavia and Europe over the course of this month. This week, she announced her headlining Am I Okay? Tour for 2025. That run is set to kick off in March.
