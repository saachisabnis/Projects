Last week, producers of the beloved Hangout Fest in Gulf Shores, Alabama, announced that country music star Morgan Wallen would be taking over the event in 2025, from May 16-18. 
Officials are presenting the new “Sand in My Boots” music festival as a one-time takeover, using the same site, layout and general production team as Hangout Fest. 
Now, we’re getting a first glimpse at which artists will grace the Gulf Shores stage(s). 
Producers previously revealed that the lineup is hand-selected by Wallen himself, leading some fans to predict an all-country schedule (in addition to the decidedly “yeehaw” new name). Luckily for Hangout fans, it looks like the festival will maintain its tradition of spanning multiple musical genres.

While the announcement has fans fearing for the future of the festival - specifically, “does this mean Hangout Fest dead?" - event producers have reiterated that the festival will return to its regularly scheduled programming in 2026.
