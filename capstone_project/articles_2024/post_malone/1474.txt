The No. 1 song on this month's list of the Top 40 Country Songs could end up as the top song for all of 2024.
Once again, this solo artist is topping streaming charts. His party song is down a spot on sales charts, but only to No. 2. Do you think you know who we're talking about?
Here's a hint, you might be getting sick of this earworm.
Elsewhere, Luke Combs has two songs inside the Top 5, and Morgan Wallen has three inside the Top 20. Watch out for newcomers, however: Hits from Ella Langley and Koe Wetzel are among the fastest-rising country songs this month.
