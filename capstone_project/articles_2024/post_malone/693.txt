TEXARKANA'S CLASSIC ROCK STATION
The Arkansas 19th Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney has announced that no charges will be filed against Bentonville Police Officer Omri-Andrew Nutt in connection with the fatal shooting of Nathaniel Mark Crabtree, 37, on July 11, 2024. 
The Bentonville Police Department (BPD) requested the Arkansas State Police’s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) to investigate the incident. In a letter dated September 6, 2024, Prosecuting Attorney Joshua Robinson explained his decision, stating:
“The investigation reveals that Nathaniel Crabtree violently attacked two separate women in front of their homes. Considering the totality of the circumstances, Officer Nutt had a reasonable belief that Mr. Crabtree would imminently use deadly physical force against him. Based upon the foregoing, Officer Nutt’s use of force was justified under Arkansas law.”
The incident occurred around 6 p.m. on July 11, when BPD officers responded to a 911 call reporting a disturbance in the Stoneburrow neighborhood on Southwest Castlewood Street. Officer Nutt later located Crabtree on Sandrock Road, where the situation escalated, leading Officer Nutt to discharge his weapon. Crabtree was struck by gunfire and later died at Northwest Medical Center in Bentonville.
Officer Nutt, who has been with the BPD since January 2022, was placed on paid administrative leave following the incident, per department protocol.
