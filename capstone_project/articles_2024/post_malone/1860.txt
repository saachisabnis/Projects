Congratulations to John Mulaney and Olivia Munn – they’re married!  Frozen 3 has a release date: it will hit theatres November 2027. Riley Green shares his first pedicure experience. And, I’ve got a clip of another Post Malone song off of F-1 Trillion (out in two days!) That and more, in today’s Entertainment Update.
XO,
Ryan
