This is the best video you will see all day. Part of the college experience is fraternities and sororities for many college students, but sometimes special needs students are left behind when it comes to college Greek Life. Clemson University has a program aimed at changing that.
ClemsonLIFE is the name of the program that focuses on special needs students getting the most out of their education, including rushing for fraternities and sororities.
So when Charlie was accepted into Eta Alpha chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, it was caught on video and you just can't help but smile.
It should be no surprise to college football fans that Clemson is leading the charge of special needs students being included. Back in 2021, Clemson's football team gained notoriety with team manager David Saville, and his special relationship with Head Coach Dabo Sweeney.
Saville, who has downs syndrome, joined the team through ClemsonLIFE and instantly became a huge part of the program's culture.
If you haven't seen the stories on Saville and the Clemson program, give this a watch, but be warned, it could have you in tears by the end.
The program has been a massive success for the school, and has given other schools a blueprint for creating similar programs for their students. Schools such as Syracuse, Appalachian State and others have followed Clemson's examples. More and more schools are doing the same.
Kudos to Clemson and congrats to Charlie and his new frat brothers!
