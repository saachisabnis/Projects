Post Malone hit the jackpot with his new country album, F-1 Trillion. Not only is it a No. 1 country album — the project just earned him a new Billboard chart record.
The newly-minted country singer is the first artist ever to snag the top position on three different albums charts over the course of his career.
Of course, F-1 Trillion landed the top spot on the Top Country Albums list after its release in August. In the past, Malone has placed his Stoney, Beerbongs & Bentleys and Hollywood's Bleeding projects in the No. 1 spot on the Top Rap Albums chart, while Austin found its way to the top of the Top Rock & Alternative chart.
Malone experienced a lot of success with his first country offering. It also landed at the peak of the all-genre Billboard 200 albums chart.
The songs on the project also logged some wins, as a whopping 18 F-1 Trillion songs landed on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. Malone's standard edition of the album featured 18 songs in total, but he added nine more tracks less than 12 hours later with a deluxe edition, dubbed F-1 Trillion: Long Bed.
None of this is surprising given that the "I Had Some Help" singer's album was already certified Gold by the RIAA before it was even released. The project sold more than 500,000 units during its presale period.
While many fans want to know if Malone will stay in country music for awhile, he has yet to reveal his future plans. For now, he's basking in his country era with his F-1 Trillion Tour. The shows are loaded with his country offerings, but he's mixing in some of his older music, as well.
