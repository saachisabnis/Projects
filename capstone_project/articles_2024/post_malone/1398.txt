After teasing it now for MONTHS, the collaboration between Post Malone and Morgan Wallen is finally here.
“I Had Some Help” dropped this past weekend and is already smashing records.
On its first day out, the song got 15.9 million global Spotify streams. That’s the most ever, across any genre, for an all-male collaboration.
It is also #1 on iTunes and the Apple Music charts and in the lead for Spotify’s “2024 Song of the Summer.”
But perhaps the biggest news was included in the press release of “I Had Some Help”. It said…
 “The single, which will be featured on Post’s first-ever full-length country album this year, comes on the heels of Post and Wallen’s landmark sets at Stagecoach.”
As for the song itself, fans are somewhat divided. Because it features a pop artist, some are bemoaning the loss of traditional country music. Some just think the song is lame. While others think the song is super catchy and great.
