Michael J. Fox has been added to the list of celebrity Swifties.

	The Back to the Future star sat down with People recently, where he named Taylor Swift as someone who will have an even greater impact in the next 50 years. “I think she’s going to be a really important person. I think she moves economies, she changes the way the world works, and that’s amazing,” he said, noting specifically what she’s “said publicly about issues,” including everything from voting rights to LGBQIA+ allyship.

	While he’s a fan now, Fox admitted that he “didn’t have an opinion about Taylor Swift when I first heard of Taylor Swift. Now I have a wife and four kids who worship her.”
