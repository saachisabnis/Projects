We hope your hungry guys and gals are loading up on Totino’s pizza rolls, because CBS has a rrrrrobust, 15-hour (!) slate of Super Bowl Sunday programming planned.
CBS will be airing Super Bowl LVIII, between [SPOILER] and [SPOILER] on Sunday, Feb. 11, starting at 6:30 pm ET. But unless you were born last night, you know there’s a lot more to Super Bowl Sunday than the Big Game™ itself. 
CBS’ Super Bowl weekend coverage actually begins on Saturday, Feb. 10, with NFL Films’ Super Bowl LVIII Countdown Show (airing at noon), followed by CBS Sports’ That Other Pregame Show (at 1 pm).

 





Turning to Super Bowl Sunday itself, CBS’ game plan is as follows (all times Eastern):

What’s the spoiler vs spoiler mean? In reference to the superbowl logo controversy? ðŸ¤” I hope/ think it’s going to be the Ravens vs the Lions! Then we can end this theory.
It took me a minute too, it’s just a cute/cheeky way of saying we don’t know who is playing yet (but pretending like the author does)
Always love road to the Super Bowl and also will tape you are looking live
I am still going to watch a to-be-determined movie on The Roku Channel or Tubi after the Super Bowl, because I am not going to be shamed or downvoted for not being happy about CBS’s Super Bowl lead-out programming choices. Not changing my mind on avoiding Tracker.
P.S.: I’m not much of a Totino’s fan, either.
