Post Malone and Luke Combs took over Lower Broadway in Nashville, Tennessee on Wednesday (July 17) to film a music video for their upcoming single "Guy for That," slated for release next month! 
Video footage, shared by Blake Shelton's Broadway bar, Ole Red, shows the music icons tearing it up on a flat-bed truck as they take a ride down one of country music's most iconic streets. The musicians-turned-friends stomped across the truck bed in their boots as cameras followed their every move and locals and tourists alike filled the streets, matching their energy. 
The surprise event breathed even more life into Lower Broadway (if that was ever possible) in what Ole Red referred to as a "casual Wednesday" for the street that never sleeps. 
Just last week, Malone (who has collaborated with a handful of country greats since two-stepping onto the scene) and Combs release a snippet of the highly-anticipated single, and that's not all they teased! The back and forth comments on the post, shared to Instagram by Combs, hinted that this was not the only collab the stars were working on.
"We doin this or what," Combs asked the "Psycho" singer, to which he promptly replied, "Okay, FINE ðŸ˜¤ but you like this more than the other one??"
While the duo's second project has yet to be elaborated upon, fans can look forward to the "Guy for That" music video and Malone's first-ever country album, F-1 Trillion, both set to be released in August.
