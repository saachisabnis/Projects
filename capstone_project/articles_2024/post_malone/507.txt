	On Tuesday night (Aug. 20), Taylor Swift capped off a five-night run at the U.K.’s Wembley Stadium, and the European run of the Eras tour, by unveiling a new music video for “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” that featured behind-the-scenes clips of the mega-selling tour. The anthem about shining in the spotlight amidst personal turmoil is featured on The Tortured Poets Department, which logs its 15th frame at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week.

	And unlike “Fortnight,” the album’s lead single featuring Post Malone that debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, “Broken Heart” has slowly been climbing back up the chart, and becoming a multi-platform hit.

	On this week’s Hot 100, “Broken Heart” moves up two spots to No. 33 in its 17th week on the chart (“Fortnight,” meanwhile, slips 11 places to No. 49). “Broken Heart” previously peaked at No. 3 on the Hot 100, when it was part of Swift’s second career flooding of the chart’s entire top 10 upon the release of The Tortured Poets Department.

	Prior to the music video release, the song’s weekly streaming numbers had hovered around 7.5 million over the past three weeks, according to Luminate. Last week (in the chart week ending Aug. 15), “Broken Heart” earned 7.67 million U.S. on-demand streams, up 3% from the previous chart week (7.43 million streams).

	However, “Broken Heart” has been growing more steadily at radio over the past month. On the Radio Songs chart dated Aug. 3, the song placed at No. 42, with an audience of 12.9 million; three weeks later, “Broken Heart” comes in at No. 25 on the current tally, with an audience of 21.1 million (up 10% from the previous chart week). “Broken Heart” debuted at No. 42 on the Pop Airplay chart on July 27, and has climbed to No. 15 over the past month — but the format with the most support has been adult pop, as the track is up to No. 8 on the Adult Pop Airplay chart.

	With “Broken Heart” picking up steam at radio while holding steady on streaming services, the music video release could help the single push towards the top 20 of the Hot 100 in the coming weeks. Fans are certainly embracing the all-access glimpse of the Eras Tour, with the “Broken Heart” video approaching 7 million views less than 24 hours after its release.
