#1 For New Country
When you think Riley Green, you think country singin', duck huntin', and maybe, underwear wearin'.
But a picture of Green that's floating around the internet shows him in a position you've never seen: Sitting in a pedicure chair!
During a recent installment of CMT's Hot 20 Countdown, Green was surprised — okay, shocked — that such a photo exists.
We have his "You Look Like You Love Me" duet partner, Ella Langley, to thank for this:
It's an image of Green getting a pedicure, and he's flashing two fingers — the symbol for peace, indicating he's not there against his will.
The "I Wish Grandpas Never Died" singer is known for his rough exterior and country boy lifestyle, so to see him in a pedicure chair, lazing and scrolling through his phone, is something we are not used to.
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you get that?" Green says when he sees it. "Whoever gave you that photo of me getting a pedicure is no damn good, I'm gonna talk to somebody."
After laughing it off, Green was happy to talk about the experience, but it's not clear he'll be back to do it again.
"It tickled. Like, I almost kicked the lady, I almost knocked her out."
If you check Green's Instagram, you will find the exact opposite content than him getting a pedicure. Here he is with his recent duck kills, pretty toes hidden in boots:
