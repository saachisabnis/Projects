Hardy has revealed a fiery new song and a spring / summer tour on Friday (Jan. 12). The "Truck Bed" singer will begin his Quit! Tour in May.
The new tour's name stems from a just-released song called "Quit!" Hardy tells his story throughout the rising, rap-rock track, beginning with the time someone wrote "Quit" on a napkin and stuffed it in his tip jar.

Over the next two-and-a-half minutes, he recalls getting his first taste of success on Florida Georgia Line and Morgan Wallen records. He also assures fans he won't change his style of music-making for anyone.
"And when it comes to the king / That's the radio / If you don't like my s--t / Don't play it / I don't give a f--k / I'm a still book arenas and fill 'em up," he sings.
A press release promises Hardy will include more new music while on tour this year, and the release of "Quit!" suggests he's working on more new music beyond his upcoming Hixtape Vol. 3 release, scheduled for March 29. That album is going to tribute Joe Diffie and feature collaborations with artists including Post Malone.
