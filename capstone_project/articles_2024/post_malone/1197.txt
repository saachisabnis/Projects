Rolling Loud Miami is officially moving to December for the first time ever. On Wednesday, April 3, the massive Hip-Hop music festival announced new dates for its flagship event in Miami. In a video that was posted to their social media platforms, Rolling Loud revealed the Miami show will happen on December 13-15 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. This will be the first time Rolling Loud will go down in December. The three-day festival is set to return to Miami just days after Art Basel wraps up its festivities in the Magic City. 
The announcement comes not long after Rolling Loud made history in California with its first-ever four-day event in honor of its 10th anniversary celebration. Ye & Ty Dolla $ign opened up the weekend with their massive solo show. Following performances from a slew of artists, Nicki Minaj invaded the second day by bringing her "Pink Friday 2 World Tour" to L.A. Post Malone headlined the following night and surprised his fans by bringing out Quavo to perform their hits. Metro Boomin and Future closed out the festival by previewing their No. 1 joint album WE DON'T TRUST YOU. Miami won't be the only stop Rolling Loud makes this year. The internationally known festival is currently preparing to hit up Vienna, Austria for Rolling Loud Europe on July 5-7. Tickets for that events are available now. If you haven't already, sign up for first access to presale tickets before they go on sale this Friday at 12 p.m.
