Jennifer Lopez will return to Saturday Night Live for the first time in over four years as the musical guest on the February 3rd episode — hosted by The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, fresh off her recent Emmy win. This marks Lopez's fourth appearance on SNL. Her first was back in 2000 with host Alan Cumming, and she returned a year later to take on both roles herself. She did that again in 2010, and last appeared in 2019 to host with musical guest DaBaby. Lopez's long-awaited, ninth studio album This Is Me… Now, is due out February 16th along with a companion film on Amazon Prime that's described as “narrative-driven cinematic odyssey, steeped in mythological storytelling and personal healing.” Ben Affleck, Fat Joe, Trevor Noah, Post Malone, Keke Palmer, Sofia Vergara, and Derek Hough will appear.
