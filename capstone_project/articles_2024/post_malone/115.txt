Blake Shelton is trying something new with his music, and his friend Carson Daly couldn’t help but tease him about it. 
Carson, the funny host of the Today Show, joked about Blake’s upcoming duet with a surprising partner.
Carson and Blake have been friends for a long time – pretty much from The Voice Season 1, 2011. 
They had many laughs together on The Voice, and Carson even officiated Blake’s wedding to Gwen Stefani!
This article examines the playful teasing between these two friends and the details of Blake’s unexpected duet with Post Malone. 
We’ll see if Carson’s jokes are just for fun and consider how this duet might change country music.
It’s interesting to see a country star like Blake working with a rapper like Post Malone. Their collaboration could bring new sounds to country music and attract different listeners. 
Let’s discuss the fun banter of Carson and Blake and the available details of Blake’s and Posty’s upcoming album!
Rumors are flying in the world of country music! Blake Shelton, known for his catchy country songs, is teaming up with Post Malone, a famous hip-hop and pop artist. 
Here’s a preview of the song!

Fans are super excited about this surprising Blake-Posty collaboration, but there aren’t many details yet.
We don’t know the official release date or the song’s title, making everyone even more curious. 
Some fans have spotted mysterious posts on social media with clips that sound like a duet. 
People are guessing the song might be called “Somebody Pour Me a Drink,” which could mix Blake’s country style with Post Malone’s cool vibe.
Is this a one-time thing for Blake, a brave mix of different music styles, or a sign of respect between two talented artists? 
No one knows for sure, but the mystery makes everyone even more eager to hear the song. 
However, Post Malone’s collaboration with Country artists isn’t new. His recent collaboration with Morgan Wallen for “I Had Some Help” and performance alongside Brad Paisley at Stagecoach are some examples.
The mystery surrounding Blake Shelton’s upcoming duet deepens! A recent Instagram post by Blake has sent fans into a frenzy. 
The picture shows Blake sitting at a counter, seemingly mesmerized by a video playing on his phone.
Eagle-eyed fans suspect the video is none other than a snippet of the much-anticipated duet with Post Malone.
Blake’s caption, simply an emoji with eyes directed at Post Malone (@postmalone), only fuels the speculation.

Fan comments explode with excitement: “It’s cowboy season for Posty,” one user joked, while another exclaimed, “STOP IM SO EXCITED it sounds so good omfg.” 
The internet approves of this unexpected pairing, with comments like “Yesss this is the pairing we all need!! Love this song!!!” and “Im speechless and screaming all at the same time my two favorite artists.”
But it wouldn’t be a true bromance without a little playful teasing! Blake’s longtime friend, Carson Daly, couldn’t resist commenting on the action. 
With mischief, Carson commented, “Posty must have lost a bet! ” This playful jab adds another layer to the intrigue. 
One thing’s for sure: Blake and Carson’s friendly banter and cryptic social media posts keep fans on the edge of their seats. 
The wait for the official release and title of the duet is getting even more exciting!
Blake Shelton and Carson Daly have a special friendship that’s built on years of laughter and joking around. 
They became close friends on The Voice, where they weren’t just coworkers but also comedy partners.
On the show, Carson often compared himself to a football coach pacing the sidelines, making Blake rolled his eyes playfully. 
Their funny moments didn’t stop there. Carson would tease Blake about his knowledge of music on social media, knowing he could handle it. This goes way back to their days on Total Request Live.
Their friendship goes beyond TV. When Blake married Gwen Stefani in 2021, Carson officiated the wedding. This shows how much trust and respect they have for each other.
In a 2023 interview with PEOPLE, Blake joked, “Carson’s a grumpy old man,” Even though this sounds serious, it’s just their way of joking
He continued: “He truly is the grumpiest man on the planet, and I’d say that if he were sitting right here next to me.”
He also said, “He is just one of those guys where he’s got a backache, or he’s mad I’m taking too long. He’s just always chewing my ass out about something.” 
Shelton added that their friendship is working “because it rolls off my back, and he’s OK with me making fun of him.”
When Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani decided to get married in 2021, they chose their good friend Carson Daly to be the officiant. 
Gwen said Carson was “an amazing guy, a good dad, and incredibly family-oriented,” which made him the perfect person for the job. 
Carson took the responsibility seriously and created special vows that reflected Blake and Gwen’s unique bond. This act showed how strong their friendship was beyond just joking around.
In October 2022, fans were sad to hear that Blake would be leaving The Voice after season 23. Carson shared his feelings on social media, writing:
“My first day ever shooting @nbcthevoice without @blakeshelton. We had a ritual of getting hair & makeup together for 23 seasons. I think I’m handling it well. Everything’s fine..”

But fans were excited again when Blake announced his new show, Barmageddon, on the USA Network.
It promises lots of fun, with celebrity contestants like Gwen Stefani, Michelle Rodriguez, and Kelly Clarkson competing in bar games for cash prizes. 
Carson will co-host with Nikki Garcia and is thrilled to be working with Blake again. 
Watch The Voice coaches competing in the Barmageddon!
