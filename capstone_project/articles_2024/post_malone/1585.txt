Hours after his first country album, F-1 Trillion, was released Friday, Post Malone surprised fans with nine additional songs. They’re part of a deluxe version of the album called F-1 Trillion: Long Bed and are all solo recordings.
Among them is “Back To Texas,” on which the Grapevine-raised singer says he “ain’t found nowhere like Dallas, yeah, and I doubt I ever will.”
Malone, born Austin Richard Post, is the latest pop singer to go full-on country. But he’s been a fan of the genre since he was a child.

“When you mix the hip-hop side of Texas with the country and add a guitar, some grills and maybe a rhinestone suit … you’ll get where I’m coming from,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2016, shortly before the release of his debut album, Stoney.
“My dad was a big influence with rock, rap and country, so it shows for sure,” he said, referring to Rich Post, a one-time DJ and former assistant director of food and beverage for the Dallas Cowboys. “The people, the sound, the whole vibe [of Dallas-Fort Worth] has definitely turned me into the artist I am, musically.”
F-1 Trillion features Malone dueting with a dozen country stars, from Dolly Parton, Tim McGraw and Hank Williams Jr. to newer acts like Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen. He’s also collaborated recently with Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, who asked him to add vocals to her Cowboy Carter song “Levii’s Jeans.”
