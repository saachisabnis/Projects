Chris Stapleton reflected on his powerful rendition of the National Anthem at Super Bowl LVII last year in an Instagram post on Thursday morning (February 8). Gearing up for the big game on Sunday (February 11), Stapleton posted a black-and-white image of himself taking the field at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where the Kansas City Chiefs won against the Philadelphia Eagles.
Stapleton’s viral “The Star-Spangled Banner” performance deeply resonated with viewers, and just in time for Fourth of July, the reigning Academy of Country Music Entertainer of the Year winner released his rendition of it (you can find it on iHeartRadio here, or watch again below).
“Singing the National Anthem at last year’s Super Bowl was a career highlight. Best of luck to all the players, staff, coaches, & performers taking the field this weekend,” Stapleton reflected in his Instagram caption on Thursday morning. He tagged Super Bowl LVIII performers Reba McEntire (National Anthem), Post Malone (“America The Beautiful”) and Andra Day (“Lift Every Voice and Sing”). Grammy Award-winning artist Usher is set to take the stage during the highly-anticipated halftime show.
McEntire joins the growing list of country artists to deliver the National Anthem performance at the Super Bowl, along with Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill, Garth Brooks and more. The performance will mark a full-circle moment for the beloved country music icon, who previously noted that “2024 marks 50 years since I was discovered singing the National Anthem at the National Finals Rodeo, and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate that anniversary.”
The Kansas City Chiefs will return to the Super Bowl, taking on the San Fransisco 49ers. Super Bowl LVIII will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada.
