Even “twin flames” need a little bit of space sometimes. 
From elaborate engagements to public breakups, Megan Fox and MGK’s romance has dominated headlines ever since they were first linked in 2020. 
Just two months after the pair met while filming “Midnight in the Switchgrass,” Brian Austin Green revealed he and the actress had split and were getting a divorce after 10 years of marriage. 
Around the same time, the “Transformers” star and the “Bloody Valentine” singer – who previously went by the stage name Machine Gun Kelly – were spotted spending lots of quality time together. 
By July 2020, Fox and MGK (real name: Colson Baker) were officially dating. 
Since then, they have given us plenty to talk about, from PDA-packed red-carpet moments to blood-sucking rituals. Keep scrolling for a complete breakdown of the couple’s whirlwind romance. 
Fox and MGK met on the set of their indie crime thriller in Puerto Rico at the beginning of 2020. On March 11, the singer shared a since-deleted photo of their chairs next to one another. 
However, the production was shut down less than a week later due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
During a joint October 2021 interview for GQ Style, Fox said she knew MGK was her “soulmate” the second they met on set.
“It was obvious from second one what it was going to be,” she said. However, she noted that they “didn’t hook up” right away.
Despite quarantine, the two sparked dating rumors after they were spotted hanging out together multiple times in May 2020.
The pair reportedly used Fox’s home as a hangout spot when her three children were with Green.
“They seem to have fun and look happy together,” a source told People at the time. “Megan only sees him when the kids are with Brian.”
Following weeks of speculation about their relationship, Fox starred alongside MGK in his “Bloody Valentine” music video.
 In the video, the two share several intimate scenes, with the “Jennifer’s Body” actress at one point duct taping the rapper’s mouth shut and taking him hostage. 
The following month, MGK told Teen Vogue that the video was his “favorite” for “personal reasons.” However, the pair still played coy about their relationship at the time. 
The pair confirmed their romance in July 2020 during an episode of the “Give Them Lala” podcast, which was co-hosted by Lala Kent and her then-boyfriend, “Midnight in the Switchgrass” producer Randall Emmett. 
“I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame,” Fox explained. “Instead of a soul mate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time.”
She added, “So we’re actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away.”
The couple made their romance Instagram-official on July 28, 2020. 
At the time, MGK posted a black-and-white photo of the duo posing in the mirror, writing in the caption, “Waited for eternity to find you again … 🔪💫❤️🔪.”
The following month, Fox posted her own black-and-white mirror selfie, captioned, “Achingly Beautiful Boy… My heart is yours 🔪♥️🔪.”
A few months after taking their romance public, the pair stepped out for their first red carpet together at the 2020 American Music Awards. 
The couple coordinated in satin looks, with Fox opting for a structured green dress while MGK wore all white.
During the show, the actress even got on stage to introduce the rocker’s performance of “Bloody Valentine” and “My Ex’s Best Friend.”
Nearly a year later, Fox took to the VMAs stage to introduce her beau once again alongside Kourtney Kardashian, whose husband, Travis Barker, was also performing.
“I am a huge fan of this next performer. I’ve watched him grow, and not just as an artist, but as a person,” Fox said. “New York, I need you to get extra loud for our future baby daddies.”
Before the show, the actress also revealed the cheeky reason MGK chose her sheer, crystal-covered Mugler gown for the event. 
“He was like, ‘You’re gonna be naked tonight,’” she told “Entertainment Tonight” on the red carpet. “I was like, ‘Whatever you say, Daddy!’ Whatever Daddy says.”
MGK popped the question after over a year of dating at the beginning of 2022.
At the time, the actress shared a video of the singer getting down on one knee in front of a special banyan tree, where they once sat at the beginning of their romance.
“Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him,” Fox captioned the post. “And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes…and then we drank each other’s blood.”
MGK designed a sentimental “toi et moi” style ring for his bride-to-be. The eye-catching sparkler featured both of their birthstones – a diamond for the rocker and an emerald for Fox. 
The two pear-shaped stones are set “on two magnetic bands of thorns that draw together as two halves of the same soul forming the obscure heart that is our love,” he wrote on Instagram.
Over a year after their engagement, the pair sparked split rumors during Super Bowl weekend in Arizona.
The day after attending a party together, Fox wiped any trace of MGK from her Instagram feed and uploaded a cryptic mirror selfie with lyrics from Beyonce’s song “Pray You Catch Me.”
“You can taste the dishonesty / it’s all over your breath,” the lyrics read, seemingly hinting at infidelity.
Fox deleted her entire Instagram account just hours later. 
The actress later clarified that there was “no third party interference” in their relationship. Several outlets reported that she had taken her engagement ring off and that they were not on good terms. 
The actress later confirmed during her March 2024 “Call Her Daddy” podcast appearance that she and MGK once called off their engagement. However, she did not clarify exactly when that was.
That same month, an insider told Page Six that the pair started “talking to a couples therapist every day” via Zoom.
“They are broken up, but Megan is seeing where they stand. She wants to see what they can salvage,” the source continued, noting that the rapper “really wants to make up.”
However, we were told that Fox wanted them to “give therapy a shot before making any permanent decisions.”
After months of trying to work things out, the couple rekindled their romance during a getaway in Hawaii in April 2023.
The pair was photographed enjoying dinner together at the Four Seasons Hotel. Although there were no signs of PDA, the twosome appeared to be in good spirits. 
A few days later, they were photographed holding hands while out on a romantic beachside stroll. 
The pair was all smiles as MGK hoisted Fox onto his back for a piggyback ride along the coast. 
Three months after their fight at the Super Bowl, the pair made their first public appearance together post-split at Sports Illustrated Swimsuit’s launch party in New York City.
Fox was one of four cover stars for the magazine’s annual swimsuit issue.
Although they did not walk the red carpet together, the couple was photographed together inside the event and MGK gushed about the actress’ “hot” photo shoot with the outlet.
Fox released her poetry book, “Pretty Boys Are Poisonous,” in November 2023. In it, Fox wrote about suffering a miscarriage alongside MGK.
“I’ve never been through anything like that in my life. I have three kids, so it was very difficult for both of us and it sent us on a very wild journey together and separately…trying to navigate, ‘What does this mean?’ and ‘Why did this happen?’” she told “Good Morning America” of the experience.
It’s unclear when the couple dealt with the heartbreaking loss. 
Fast forward to February 2024, and the singer also seemingly mentioned their miscarriage in his song “dont let me go,” in which he sings about his “thoughts eating me alive.” 
“How can I live with the fact / That my hand wasn’t on her stomach when we lost the baby,” he sings.
Fox seemingly confirmed that she and MGK were still together in April 2024 — despite playing coy about the pair’s relationship status the month prior on “Call Her Daddy.”
The actress joined her one-time fiancé at his house to celebrate his 34th birthday. Fox was reportedly seen making the rounds at the birthday boy’s side.
Other celebrity guests at the bash included Post Malone, Mod Son and Amber Rose.
Fox announced she was pregnant and expecting a rainbow baby with MGK.
“nothing is ever really lost. welcome back 👼🏼❤️,” she wrote on Instagram Nov. 11, 2024.
In the carousel of pictures, the actress cradled her growing baby bump while she was covered in black paint. 
In the second photo, she showed off a positive pregnancy test.
Fox tagged the “Wild Boy” emcee on her belly in the post but turned off the comments.
Fox and MGK reportedly split over Thanksgiving weekend after the actress found something upsetting in the rocker’s phone. 
At the time, an insider told TMZ the pair called it quits while vacationing together in Vail. Colo. They reportedly got into a big fight and Fox left the trip early. 
They had yet to speak by Dec. 10, 2024, nearly two weeks after the argument, per the outlet.
