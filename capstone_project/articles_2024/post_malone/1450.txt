Each March 17, towns and cities are awash in Kelly green as pints of Guinness are lifted in the name of St. Patrick.
Even though St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and credited with bringing Christianity to the Emerald Isle, many of the traditions associated with St. Patrick’s Day revelry actually originated on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.
The familiar traditions of St. Patrick’s Day, such as parades of pipers, drinking anything green and dining on green bagels, did not originate in the Irish countryside. Many were the product of the prosperity of North America. In fact, the original St. Patrick’s Day celebrations of old in Ireland were much more modest and centered on religion rather than revelry.
History.com indicates that, since 1631, St. Patrick’s Day had been a religious feast day commemorating the death of St. Patrick, a missionary who brought religious teachings to a then-pagan nation. Celebrations were solemn and focused on church and family.
Across the pond, as the number of Irish immigrants grew, so did the merrymaking. In cities throughout America, St. Patrick’s Day took on a more celebratory air.
According to research discovered by historian Dr. J. Michael Francis in 2017, gunpowder expenditures logs in Spain’s Archivo General de Indias indicate artillery was fired for a feast day of San Patricio (St. Patrick) in 1600 in St. Augustine, Florida. In fact, St. Patrick would go on to become the official “protector” of the city’s maize fields in this Spanish garrison town. This seems to have been more of a festival than a parade, though it certainly predates celebrations and parades that took place in Boston and New York in 1737 and 1762, respectively, and oddly links St. Patrick with both Irish and Spanish immigrants.
Even the famed “corned beef and cabbage” was an American invention. Ham and cabbage were eaten in Ireland, but corned beef proved a cheaper substitute for impoverished Irish immigrants in the United States. It was the cheapest meat to be found at the time and soon was a staple of the holiday.
St. Patrick’s Day remained solemn in Ireland (laws prohibited pubs from opening on holy days until 1973) even as merry-making grew elsewhere. However, with the invention of television, the Irish could see the revelry taking place in America. Eventually, the country took note and started celebrating in a similar fashion.
It’s often suggested that everyone is Irish on March 17, which marks the celebration of St. Patrick, who is the primary patron saint of Ireland. The boisterous parades, jovial atmosphere and welcoming attitudes of pubs and partiers has undoubtedly contributed to the popularity of St. Patrick’s Day. That popularity also benefits from Irish emigration.
According to University College Cork, approximately 10 million people have emigrated from Ireland since 1800. Irish emigrants have relocated to countries across the globe, which perhaps explains why St. Patrick’s Day is now celebrated in more than 200 countries worldwide.
Though St. Patrick’s Day is a religious holiday for many practicing Catholics, the day also is a largely secular celebration of Irish culture, which has remained popular thanks to the millions of people who have brought their heritage and customs with them even as they sailed away from the Emerald Isle, often in large numbers.
Snakes play a significant role in the legend of St. Patrick, the primary patron saint of Ireland and the man who inspired a wildly popular mid-March holiday. Though the notion of St. Patrick bravely banishing snakes from Ireland certainly supports his worthiness as the island’s patron saint, historians note this particular portion of the legend of St. Patrick is a myth.
A 2012 report in National Geographic News noted that post-glacial Ireland never had snakes, as the most recent ice age made the island too cold for reptiles until the period ended 10,000 years ago. By that point, Ireland was surrounded by seas, which scientists and historians believe kept snakes from colonizing the island. Though the precise dates of St. Patrick’s life remain unknown, it’s likely he was an active missionary in Ireland during the 5th century, at which time natural history experts in Ireland attest there were no snakes on the Emerald Isle.
Music is front and center during St. Patrick’s Day parties and other celebrations. Imparting traditional music and modern Irish songs into St. Patrick’s Day fanfare can kick parties up another notch.
To get the celebration started, consider adding these Irish songs to your St. Patrick’s Day event, courtesy of Irish Travel Guide, Vagabond Tours and The Irish Road Trip.
• “The Lonesome Boatman”: This is a lesser-known Irish folk song that debuted on the 1969 album from Finbar and Eddie. It is a haunting song that features the tin whistle, like many traditional Irish songs.
• “Molly Malone”: This song has been an anthem for the people of Dublin since the late 19th century. It talks about a Dublin fishmonger, and The Dubliners’ take is a popular version.
• “A Nation Once Again”: This hymn was written in the early to mid-1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis. As the creator of the Young Irelander movement, he helped pave the way for changes in Irish nationalism, and the song is often classified as “Irish rebel music.”
• “Grace”: This song was written about an Irish artist who married Joseph Mary Plunkett, one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. “Grace” is a sad Irish folk song, but a classic nonetheless.
• “The Fields of Athenry”: This tune often is considered the unofficial national anthem of Ireland. It captures the tragedy of the Great Famine as well as the enduring spirit of the Irish people.
• “Wild Mountain Thyme”: This classic folk song has stood the test of time and recently was covered by pop star Ed Sheeran. It has become synonymous with Ireland, even though it may trace its origins to 18th-century Scotland.
• “Zombie”: While not a traditional Irish folk song, “Zombie” was written by one of the best-known alternative Irish rock bands, The Cranberries. It’s a powerful song that alludes to The Troubles in Northern Ireland.
• “Danny Boy”: What St. Patrick’s Day gathering would be complete without the widely recognized “Danny Boy”? This classic was inspired by the Siege of Derry, and the song became renowned during World War II. Frederick Edward Weatherly, an English barrister and singer, put lyrics to “Danny Boy” in 1912.
• “Raglan Road”: This song is known as one of Ireland’s most romantic tunes. Poet Patrick Kavanagh wrote the lyrics, purportedly inspired by his brief connection with Dr. Hilda Moriarty.
• “The Rocky Road to Dublin”: A tale of the adventures and troubles of a man traveling to Liverpool from his home in Ireland, this is a popular Irish song among tourists.
• “The Wild Rover”: This tune tells of a wayward son spending money on beer and whiskey but promising to return home to change his wild ways. It’s a classic Irish drinking song.
