No one was more excited for Taylor Swift to take home an award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards than Flavor Flav.
Flav showed up in style — and full Olympic support — at the VMAs on Wednesday (September 11), where he and Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles presented the award for Best Collaboration to Swift and Post Malone for their collab "Fortnight," off Swift's album The Tortured Poets Department. 
After he and Chiles announced the win, Flav couldn't contain his excitement for his pal, jumping up and down as Swift and Post made their way to the stage. The Public Enemy rapper also made sure to show his support in the most relatable way, by giving Swift a big bear hug before she gave her acceptance speech, as seen in this wholesome video.

Flav has been a vocal Swiftie for a long time, revealing last year that he "loves all her music" and even singing one of his favorite songs of hers on the red carpet at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards.
