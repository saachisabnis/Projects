Shelton and Stefani met in 2014 on the set of The Voice. They confirmed their budding relationship the following year. They announced their engagement in 2020, and got married in July 2021 in a stunning ceremony on the country star’s ranch in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. Over the years, Stefani and Shelton have released several collaborations together, including “Happy Anywhere,” “Nobody But You,” and their cover of “Love Is Alive,” a 1980s classic by The Judds, which appears on a star-studded tribute album honoring the legendary mother-daughter duo. Stefani described “Purple Irises” as a love song and “a snapshot of feeling the moment,” and finding the truth in her relationship. She and Shelton appeared on The Bobby Bones Show on Friday to discuss the inspiration behind their latest romantic duet. Watch the interview clip below.
