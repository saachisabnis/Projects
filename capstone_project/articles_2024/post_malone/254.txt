(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rapper-singer Post Malone, seen here opening a Raising Cane's he designed in Midvale in 2023, is going on tour in fall 2024 — with the first show in Utah.
Post Malone — rapper, singer and transplanted Utahn — is touring this fall, and he’s starting close to home.
The musician announced Tuesday that his “F-1 Trillion” tour will cover 21 cities, starting Sunday, Sept. 8, at the Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre in West Valley City.
The tour will support Post Malone’s country-inflected album, “F-1 Trillion,” which will be released Aug. 16. The first two singles from that album, already released, have Post Malone working with popular country stars: “I Had Some Help” with Morgan Wallen, and “Pour Me a Drink” with Blake Shelton.
Tickets for the tour will go on sale in a presale Wednesday at 10 a.m. local time, for Citi cardmembers. General tickets go on sale Monday, at 10 a.m., on livenation.com. VIP packages are also available.
