Much of the talk surrounding Amazon’s remake of 1989 cult classic “Road House” has been mired in controversy over the release strategy.
The talk has stemmed from a reported disagreement between the parties with director Doug Liman, leading man Jake Gyllenhaal and others wanting a theatrical run whereas Amazon is going direct-to-streaming.
Two weeks ago a trade story went into details about what happened, namely that the project was setup initially as a theatrical release via MGM.
Amazon then acquired MGM and gave those involved an option ahead of a green light – make the film for $60 million as a theatrical release or make it for $85 million as a streaming-only release.  They chose the latter.
Liman then released an open letter in late January that he would boycott the film’s premiere claiming that “Amazon has no interest in supporting cinemas.”
Now, Gyllenhaal has weighed in during an interview with Total Film magazine and says Amazon always planned to release the film direct-to-streaming:
“I adore Doug’s tenacity, and I think he is advocating for filmmakers, and film in the cinema, and theatrical releases. But, I mean, Amazon was always clear that it was streaming.
I just want as many people to see it as possible. And I think we’re living in a world that’s changing in how we see and watch movies, and how they’re made.
What’s clear to me, and what I loved so much, was [Liman’s] deep love for this movie, and his pride at how much he cares for it, how good he feels it is, and how much people should see it.”
Gyllenhaal stars as Elwood Dalton, a former UFC fighter recruited to work at a roadhouse in the Florida Keys and prevent a violent gang from taking over the bar. Daniela Melchior, Jessica Williams, Billy Magnussen, Darren Barnet, Lukas Gage, Post Malone, and Conor McGregor co-star.
“Road House” will stream to Prime Video on March 21st.
