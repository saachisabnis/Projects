Beyoncé ended the month of July in New Jersey. 
It’s been officially reported that Beyoncé filmed a commercial for ‘Levi’s Jean’s’ in a Nutley, New Jersey laundromat on July 31.
Filming took place inside the Laundry Basket laundromat, next to the Nutley Diner on Centre Street. It was not clear when the commercial will air.

The collaboration between Beyoncé and Levi’s should come as no surprise. On her latest album, Cowboy Carter, the singer pays homage to the legacy denim brand. Featuring Post Malone, “Levii’s Jeans” stands out for its catchy vibes and seductive lyrics.
In the week after the album’s release, the clothing company Levi Strauss & Co noted a 20% rise in footfall at stores across the US and a 20% increase in its share price. In the UK, John Lewis report that searches for “women’s Levi’s jeans” were up 263% since the record was announced.
Levi Strauss have embraced the megastar nod – temporarily changing its name on Instagram to Levii’s as a tribute. Speaking on a conference call last week, the chief executive, Michelle Gass, emphasised the brand’s position at the heart of culture. “I don’t think there’s any better evidence or proof point than having someone like Beyoncé, who is a culture shaper, to actually name a song after us,” she said.
