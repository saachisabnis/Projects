Reigning CMA and ACM Entertainer of the Year Lainey Wilson is preparing to drop her next album, Whirlwind, on August 23. In celebration of that, the "Hang Tight Honey" singer stopped by the Taste of Country Nights studio to chat with Evan Paul.
Knowing that Wilson has a song with Post Malone, "Nosedive," on Malone's country debut F-1 Trillion (Aug. 16), we wanted to ask Wilson her thoughts on Malone.
Was Lainey Wilson Skeptical About Post Malone Going Country?
"No, not at all," the "Heart Like a Truck" singer says, "because I had heard that he was influenced by a lot of country. He grew up listening to country."
"Once I met him and wrote with him and just worked with him, I realized this dude knows more about country music than a lot of folks," she adds.
Wilson went on to make sure everyone knows that Malone is where he belongs now:
"It's really incredible because the dude just loves music. He loves all kinds of music. I think he absolutely deserves to be in this genre, and I'm excited for him."
We asked Wilson if Malone was a handshake or a hug type of guy, and she replied quickly.
"Oh a hug, a hold-ya-tight kind of guy, you know what I'm saying?"
Surely the two got a chance to hug it out before they performed "Nosedive" at Malone's Grand Ole Opry debut this week.
Ahead of Malone's album release, it had already gone Gold for 500,000 units sold, so it's clear more than just his collaborators are excited he's gone country.
