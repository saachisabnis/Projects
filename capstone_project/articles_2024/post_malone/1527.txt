Luke Combs just playfully jokes with Post Malone, who posted a photo of him in Luke's merch on stage.
Here's the problem: The shirt that he's wearing is bootlegged and NOT official merch from Luke. So, while Luke was stoked that Posty was giving him some love, he understandably had to give him a little crap over wearing janky merch.
Posty put the pics up on Instagram and Luke was quick to comment. He wrote, "Shirt is gas. Even though it's bootleg haha."
Fans loved it, and commented, quote, "You need to send him a legit one now" and "He got a guy for that".
