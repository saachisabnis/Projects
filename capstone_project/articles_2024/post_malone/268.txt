The May 11, 2024, 59th Academy of Country Music Awards was a memorable evening. 
Although the ceremony and behind-the-scenes events did not appear on camera, there were nevertheless several fascinating things that happened during the Awards.

So, let’s get started.
Lainey Wilson achieved history by winning three popular awards, including Entertainer of the Year. 
Her other honors, which she earned with Jelly Roll for their work on “Save Me,” were Female Artist of the Year and Music Event of the Year. 
The best part of the evening was Wilson’s remarks, in which she acknowledged her peers for their support and related her experience in Nashville. 
Wilson talked about her early career difficulties in her Entertainer of the Year award speech. 
“I remember playing performances for 10 people, and I remember thinking, ‘Is this worth it?’ I was aware, yet, of my gift and my destiny.” 
“I’m so grateful to be in this room with all of you,” she said as she acknowledged her team, family, and other artists. 
At 8 nominations, Luke Combs was the most suggested artist of the evening.
For his song of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” Combs won Single of the Year even though he wasn’t there for the ceremony. 
Combs became one of the most popular country musicians of all time with this victory, his 16th ACM Award. 
Combs had a prior appointment at a concert in California, which is why he was not present at the event. 
His crew took up the trophy on his behalf, and both colleagues and fans kept appreciating his music. 
At the 2024 ACM Awards, Jason Aldean offered an homage to Toby Keith. Keith’s family was also there.
Throughout the performance, which included Aldean performing some of Keith’s best hits, Keith’s family, wife Tricia, and daughter Krystal were overwhelmed.
