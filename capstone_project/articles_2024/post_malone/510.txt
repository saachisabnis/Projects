Beyoncé’s anticipated album, Act ii: Cowboy Carter, was released on Friday; however, fans are confused about the vinyl version missing five songs. 
A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)
Some fans who received vinyl and CD copies noticed that certain tracks were missing, which are available across all streaming platforms. The Beyhive shared on social media that songs such as “Spaghetti,” “Flamenco,” “The Linda Martell Show,” “Ya Ya,” and “Oh Louisiana” were missing from the physical copies of the album. 
According to Variety, complaints about the album have been met with an automated response stating that they are experiencing a high volume of emails and will address the concerns in 3-4 days.
The article reports that fans suspect the missing songs stem from deadlines with vinyl and CD manufacturers, such as Nicki Minaj’s Pink Friday 2 album. The claim was disputed as the track “II Most Wanted” featuring Miley Cyrus appears on physical copies, but Cyrus stated that the song was made in February.
Beyoncé was in Japan over the weekend for an album-signing event. She has not publicly addressed any confusion related to the event. The megastar’s new album has garnered critical and fan acclaim as she enters a new era.
Act ii: Cowboy Carter features Post Malone, Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Willie Nelson, Willie Jones, Linda Martell, Shaboozey, and Tiera Kennedy. A viral video surfaced over the weekend of a fan showing off her dance moves to Beyoncé’s amazement at an album-signing event.
