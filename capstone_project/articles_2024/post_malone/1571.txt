Beyoncé joined forces with Post Malone on a country song named “Levii’s Jeans” as part of latest album, and this reference has now given Levi Strauss & Co. a massive push.
Soon after Bey’s Cowboy Carter dropped last month, the American clothing company altered its Instagram name to mirror the aforementioned song title. According to CBS News, their stock spiked by 20% on Thursday (April 4).

“I would just say that denim is having a moment and the Levi’s brand is having a powerful moment around the world,” chief executive officer Michelle Gass said.
“One of the things that really is significant about the Levi’s brand and we place a lot of emphasis and investment is making sure that Levi’s brand remains in the center of culture. And I don’t think there’s any better evidence or proof point than having someone like Beyoncé, who is a culture shaper, to actually name a song after us.”
Beyoncé‘s pivot to country has already earned her tons of co-signs, but praise from Sir Paul McCartney is arguably one of her most commendable wins so far.
The Houston native released a cover of The Beatles‘ 1968 hit “Blackbird” as part of the same LP mentioned above. Written during the Fab Four’s famous trip to India, the song was a response to the racial turbulence of the Civil Rights era, which sadly continues to cripple the United States even today.

Earlier this week, the Liverpool legend expressed his admiration for Queen Bey’s rendition of his composition while emphasizing its modern-day relevance in a lengthy Instagram post.
“I am so happy with @beyonce’s version of my song ‘Blackbird,'” he wrote next to a photograph of them together. “I think she does a magnificent version of it and it reinforces the civil rights message that inspired me to write the song in the first place.”

He continued: “I think Beyoncé has done a fab version and would urge anyone who has not heard it yet to check it out. You are going to love it! I spoke to her on FaceTime and she thanked me for writing it and letting her do it. I told her the pleasure was all mine and I thought she had done a killer version of the song.
“When I saw the footage on the television in the early 60s of the black girls being turned away from school, I found it shocking and I can’t believe that still in these days there are places where this kind of thing is happening right now. Anything my song and Beyoncé’s fabulous version can do to ease racial tension would be a great thing and makes me very proud.”
