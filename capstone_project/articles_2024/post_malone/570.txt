BeyoncÃ©’s shift into the world of country music paid off Friday with a leading 11 nominations for the 67th annual Grammy Awards, while both Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter made a major splash, scoring nods in all four of the top categories of Album, Record and Song of the Year and Best New Artist.
BeyoncÃ©’s “Cowboy Carter” scored her a nomination for the top prize of Album of the Year, a category that also includes “New Blue Sun” by AndrÃ© 3000, “Short n’ Sweet” by Sabrina Carpenter, “Brat” by Charli XCX, “Djesse Vol. 4” by Jacob Collier, “Hit Me Hard and Soft” by Billie Eilish, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” by Chappell Roan and “The Tortured Poets Department” by Taylor Swift.
The nomination for Swift give her a career total of seven nominations in the Album of the Year category, breaking a tie with Barbara Streisand and giving her the most ever nods for a female artist. BeyoncÃ©’s nomination is her fifth in the category, the most ever for a Black artist, but she has never won the prize. The nod for Eilish, meanwhile, makes her three-for-three in her career. Her first two albums were also nominated, and she won the prize in 2021 for her debut release “Everything I Wanted.”
BeyoncÃ©, Eilish and Swift all scored spots in the categories of Album, Record and Song of the Year, along with Roan and Carpenter.
With her 11 nominations this year, BeyoncÃ© now has a record-setting 99 career Grammy nods, the most ever by any artist.
The Record of the Year category also featured a nomination for a little band known as The Beatles, who were nominated for their recently released track “Now and Then.”
Also nominated in the category were “Texas Hold ‘Em” by BeyoncÃ©, “Espresso” by Carpenter, “360” by Charli XCX, “Birds of a Feather” by Eilish, “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar, “Good Luck, Babe!” by Roan, and “Fortnight” by Swift and Post Malone.

Nominations for Song of the Year, a prize awarded to the songwriters, went to Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather,” Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die with a Smile,” Swift and Malone’s “Fortnight,” Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!,” Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” and BeyoncÃ©’s “Texas Hold `Em.”
Charli XCX, Eilish, Lamar and Malone each collected seven nominations, while Carpenter, Roan and Swift all earned six.
Carpenter and Roan will compete in the best new artist category with Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims.
If either Carpenter or Roan manage to sweep the awards in all four of the top Grammy categories, it would be the first time it has happened since Christopher Cross pulled off the feat in 1981.
The Grammy nominations were announced in livestream led by Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr., joined by Grammy winners Brandy Clark, Kirk Franklin, David Frost, Robert Gordon, Kylie Minogue, Victoria MonÃ©t, Gaby Moreno, Deanie Parker, Ben Platt, Mark Ronson, and Hayley Williams, along with Grammy-nominated comedian Jim Gaffigan and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King.
“Today we celebrate the amazing creative achievements of our music community,” Mason said in a statement after the announcement. “It was an incredible year in music and these nominations reflect the work of a voting body that is more representative of the music community than ever before. The Grammy became music’s most coveted award precisely because the recognition comes from one’s peers, and I’m so grateful for the Academy’ s 13,000 voting members who take the time to evaluate all the amazing music, cast their votes, and honor their peers. Congratulations to all the nominees.”
The 67th Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 2 at the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles and broadcast live on CBS. The awards recognize material that was released between Sept. 16, 2023, and Aug. 30, 2024.
