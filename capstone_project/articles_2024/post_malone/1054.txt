Without QUESTION, Post Malone is the hottest show for Maine in 2024. When it was announced that Malone's "A Collection of Country Songs" tour was coming through Bangor, the excitement reverberated all throughout Maine.
Posty will be rocking the stage Monday, September 16th at Maine Savings Amphitheater. Here's how to be a part of the excitement and be all ... M-ALONE.
The most obvious way to be a part of the Post Malone party is to attend the show. There's no better way than doing so for free. Townsquare Media's Q106.5 morning show David & Cindy have tickets for you to win, and your first opportunity will be this Sunday, August 11th and Thursday, August 15th.
Across the street from Maine Savings Amphitheater is Urban Pizza. David, Cindy and Jordan Verge from Q106.5 will be there beginning at 5pm on both August 11th and August 15th host a pre-party before the Dan + Shay and Kenny Chesney concerts.
They will be holding a drawing live on-air Friday, August 16th (exactly one month before Post Malone arrives in Maine).To be entered into the drawing, all you have to do is show up while Q106.5 is at Urban Pizza, say hi, and share that you have the Q106.5 app on your phone. Your name will be entered and hopefully drawn on Friday for a free pair of tickets.
David & Cindy will have more opportunities to win via the Q106.5 app as we get closer to the show.
Bull Moose in Bangor, Lewiston, and Scarborough are hosting a Post Malone listening party to his new album, "F-1 Trillion" on Saturday, August 10th from 4:30pm until 5pm. "F-1 Trillion" will be available August 20th.
