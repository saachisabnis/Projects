	The TikTok Billboard Top 50 is a weekly ranking of the most popular songs on TikTok in the United States based on creations, video views and user engagement. The latest chart reflects activity April 22-28. Activity on TikTok is not included in Billboard charts except for the TikTok Billboard Top 50. As previously noted, titles that are part of Universal Music Group’s catalog are currently unavailable on TikTok, though the music could soon return following this week’s new licensing agreement between the two companies.

	The continued reign of “Tell Ur Girlfriend,” Bankz’s first song to top the list, remains buoyed by a dance trend using the song, though some more recent clips have also discussed the singer’s appearance in the music video and TikToks promoting the song, and others reference viral uploads of women wearing the same black top and blue jeans outfit.




			Trending on Billboard		






	Whatever the cause, “Tell Ur Girlfriend” jumps 28% in official chart-eligible U.S. streams April 19-25, vaulting to 11.3 million in all, according to Luminate. It leaps 24-17 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart dated May 4 as a result.

	One spot below “Tell Ur Girlfriend” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50, Bakar’s “Hell N Back,” featuring Summer Walker, achieves a new peak of No. 2, rising 4-2. The latest rise of the 2019 track still centers around Walker’s “I was over love, I had enough, then I found you” lyric from the 2023 remix, with many of the top videos showcasing relationships or friendships while they lip-synch.
those comments humbled me #fyp #foryoupage #notaperm 

	“Hell N Back” ascends 5% in chart-eligible streams April 19-25 to 9.3 million, which in turn allows it to lift 6-5 on the Hot Alternative Songs survey.

Artemas’ “I Like the Way You Kiss Me” falls 2-3 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50, while No. 4 belongs to a debut in Taylor Swift’s “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?” The song leads a group of five songs from Swift’s new album The Tortured Poets Department on the chart; both “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” (which leaps 25-14) and the Post Malone-featuring “Fortnight” (50-32) had ranked on the April 27 tally, while “So High School” (No. 33) and “But Daddy I Love Him” (No. 42) also debut.

	










	“Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?” is the runaway favorite on TikTok, however. And that’s thanks to a trend highlighting its “Who’s afraid of little old me?/ You should be” chorus lyric, with videos starting with a seemingly innocuous subject that then turns threatening or violent upon the second half of the verse.

	The song is one of the tracks from The Tortured Poets Department to take up the entire top 14 of the multimetric Billboard Hot 100, as previously reported, debuting at No. 9 via 37.9 million streams and 4,000 downloads.

	The next biggest TikTok Billboard Top 50 debut is courtesy of Phoebe Bridgers, whose “Scott Street” – specifically its slowed-down version – bows at No. 6. “Scott Street” was originally released on Bridgers’ 2018 full-length debut Stranger in the Alps, and the sound these days often soundtracks reunions, clips about a chapter in someone’s life closing and other emotional moments.

Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is the final top 10 debut of the week, starting at No. 9. Like some of the top-performing country songs on TikTok of recent weeks – Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” and Dasha’s “Austin” among them – “A Bar Song” benefits in large part from a dance trend, sometimes performed in country attire.

	“A Bar Song” leaps 95% in chart-eligible streams April 19-25 to 20.9 million, resulting in its coronation as the new No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs list.
