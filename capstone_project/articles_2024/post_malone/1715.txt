We smell major deals ahead.
The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is now in full swing, offering serious discounts on plenty of celeb-approved fashion and beauty brands — including Jo Malone London.
Everyone from Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle to Sofia Richie and Sienna Miller are fans of the British brand’s luxe colognes, candles and soaps, and right now, a number of Jo Malone scents are majorly marked down.
For those new to Jo Malone, the Nordstrom-exclusive Cologne Collection Set ($90, a $115 value) is a solid choice, offering mini bottles of five different fragrances including the Duchess of Sussex’s favorite, Wood Sage & Sea Salt. 
The then-“Suits” actress told the Daily Express in 2016 that she switched between the windswept, beach-inspired scent and the brand’s Wild Bluebell Cologne (from $85).
Sofia Richie also praised the “beachy” fragrance in a 2023 Instagram post, saying, “It just makes me feel safe and calm,” while Helen Mirren told Harper’s Bazaar UK the brand’s colognes are “just nice and light.” 
But Jo Malone’s sophisticated colognes aren’t the only products you can grab for a royally good bargain, as its ultra-luxe Body & Hand Wash ($55, a $76 value) and Lime Basil & Mandarin Diffuser Duo ($145, a $220 value) are both on sale as well.
And although the Orange Blossom Scented Home Candle ($80) the Prince and Princess of Wales burned during their 2011 wedding isn’t included in the sale, you can grab the equally sweet-smelling English Pear & Freesia Home Candle Duo ($105, a $160 value) for more than $50 off.
Along with Jo Malone, you’ll find plenty of other fragrance exclusives up for grabs in the sale, including a Discovery Kit ($67, a $99 value) from Jennifer Lopez’s beloved Le Labo and the Diptyque 4-Piece Candle Gift Set ($126, a $180 value), which includes the Markle-approved Figuier and Baies scents.
As for these deals, don’t delay — the Anniversary Sale ends on August 5.
