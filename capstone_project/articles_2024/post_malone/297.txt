The 2024 ACM Awards started with a performance from a woman in red and ended with a woman with red hair. Country icons and newcomers teamed with newcomers and out-of-genre superstars for two hours of great country music.
The show was nearly a Lainey Wilson bookend. She opened singing her new single "Hang Tight Honey," arguably a Top 3 performance of the night. She closed by winning her second ever Entertainer of the Year award.
