The Stagecoach Country Music Festival is making its way to the Empire Polo Club in Indio following both weekends of its sister event, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, on April 26-28.
The three-day country festival includes headliners Eric Church, Miranda Lambert and Morgan Wallen, supported by acts such as Post Malone, Jelly Roll, Hardy, Willie Nelson & Family, Bailey Zimmerman, Leon Bridges, Diplo, Dwight Yoakam, the Beach Boys, Wiz Khalifa, Carin León and more.
As fans head out with cowboy boots and hats in tow, here’s what you need to know before embarking to Stagecoach.
Stagecoach remains steadfast as a fortress of country music, butt this year it embraces the evolution of the genre and the rich tapestry of diversity within it. And with big names like Wiz Khalifa and Post Malone, whose set is billed as a “special set of country covers,” it just works.
Carin León, the Regional Mexican sensation, returns to the grounds of Indio following back-to-back weekend performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Hailing from Hermosillo, Mexico, León passionately advocates that the essence of the genre transcends geographical boundaries, transforming into a national celebration, a sentiment echoed by his Stagecoach debut. While León is the sole Spanish-language performer on the lineup, he is not alone in representing Latin talent. Wyatt Flores, the Oklahoma-raised Mexican-American country crooner, is set to play on Friday.
And for the devoted Beyoncé fans, there’s a possibility that the R&B megastar might grace this year’s Stagecoach with her presence. This speculation arises from the inclusion of three female artists featured on her latest country venture, “Cowboy Carter,” in the festival lineup.
Among them is Tanner Adell, an emerging singer-songwriter whose recent album “Black Bunny” dropped last year. Adell’s soulful voice resonates on “Blackbiird,” a track featuring three other prominent Black women in the country music sphere. Adell will perform on the Mane Stage at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 27.
Another noteworthy name from the “Cowboy Carter” collaboration is Brittney Spencer, whose debut album “My Stupid Life” dropped this year. Spencer will hit the Palomino Stage at 1:55 p.m. on Sunday, April 28.
Grammy-winning soul and blues rocker Leon Bridges will perform at the Palomino Stage at 7:25 p.m. on Saturday, April 27.
Adding to the festival’s allure is the husband-and-wife duo, The War and Treaty, Grammy-nominated for their soulful blend of folk, country and blues. Fans can expect a double dose as they grace the Mane Stage at 3:20 p.m. on Sunday, April 28, followed by a special performance at the Bud Light Backyard stage at 6:10 p.m.
After experiencing a complete overhaul of stages and layout last year, fans encountered unforeseen challenges as areas designated for blankets and chairs encroached upon traditional walkways. Acknowledging these concerns, the festival organizers are reverting to the familiar layout that fans have come to anticipate, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable experience for all.
This year, the cherished Nikki Lane Stage Stop Marketplace bids farewell to the Stagecoach grounds. Established in 2018, the marketplace was a treasure trove of vintage discoveries and country-inspired apparel from small vendors nationwide. Notably, the marketplace also housed Lane’s curated Horseshoe Stage, where unexpected surprise guests such as Lana Del Rey would perform alongside Lane.
Even though Lane’s Stage Stop Marketplace is out of business this year, the festival will be providing a flea market of the same style where fans can walk through a line of vendors locations southeast of the Beer Barn near the Compton Cowboys. The market will have everything from boots to wallet buckles and more.
The Compton Cowboys, a group of friends who use horseback riding to create a safe space for inner-city youth, will be back at Stagecoach with horse demonstrations by the Beer Barn.
Guy Fieri’s Stagecoach Smokehouse will also be back, deemed a fan favorite attraction. The smokehouse includes barbecue pitmasters from across the country. Of course, he’ll have his usual cooking demonstrations with free samples. He’ll be joined by Jelly Roll, Clint Black, Diplo, Hardy and Bailey Zimmerman.
The Shein Saloon will be in full swing once again and fans can giddy up with free Western fit essential accessories like cowboy hats and glittered fanny packs. The saloon will also have photo opps with a mirrored bull and even time for cowboy karaoke throughout the day.
And if children are coming to the festival, bring their little boots by the Half-Pint Hootenanny for an air-conditioned space featuring games like an air hockey table, giant jenga and bowling, along with arts and crafts.
