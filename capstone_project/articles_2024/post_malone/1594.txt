Welcome to the RACER Mailbag. Questions for any of RACER’s writers can be sent to mailbag@racer.com. We love hearing your comments and opinions, but letters that include a question are more likely to be published. Questions received after 3pm ET each Monday will be saved for the following week.
Q: So much is made of IndyCar driver and sponsor moves. Can you do a piece or expound here on some of the silly season related to the engineering side? With a spec series and so many years with this chassis, we know engineers can make a huge difference. Of course the relationship between the driver and engineer, along with the overall chemistry and philosophy of the team, can make some engineers look like rock stars while others who thrived in one setting suddenly struggle at others.
What is lacking at RLL to make the engineering side gel together or make a difference? I know in this series if you miss it badly one year you are going to really be on your back foot for at least two years playing catch-up while everybody pulls away. Also, who are the junior engineers or Indy NXT engineers ready for that promotion that will make a difference?
Doug Elmore
MP: Think of the car and driver like the quarterback and football, and the race engineer as the head coach and offensive coordinator calling the plays.
We went into depth on what RLL needs in all areas in the last two Mailbags — if you missed them, they’re here and here.
The next assistant or performance race engineer to get the bump to race engineer is Kate Gundlach at Arrow McLaren. NXT race engineers have too much to learn in their first IndyCar seasons to be hailed as difference-makers in waiting. One who made the transition who has impressed me is Andretti’s Ron Barhorst, who was moved up to Devlin DeFrancesco’s IndyCar program in 2023 and over to Meyer Shank Racing in 2024.
Q: Since it’s a long off-season, here are some of my bold predictions:
Ed, Jersey
MP: I can confirm nine of the 11 as being true. Also:
RMB, Formula 1, IMSA, IndyCar, NASCAR, Viewpoints
