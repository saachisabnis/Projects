Following the chart-topping success of Post Malone’s country collaboration with Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help,” the hit-making musician took to Instagram on Thursday to tease his newest musical partnership with Blake Shelton. In the short clip, Malone is seen in the recording studio excitedly air-drumming and nodding his head to the beat of the new song while pouring himself a stiff drink. “🍻 @blakeshelton,” Malone captioned his post, with the two cheering beers fitting the “somebody pour me a drink” line from the song. Shelton followed that up with an Instagram reel of his own, watching Posty’s video in his kitchen while sipping a drink out of a plastic cup. Even Shelton’s wife, Gwen Stefani, is excited about the collaboration, commenting, “Can’t handle this much cool and cute!! Super fan alert!” (People)
