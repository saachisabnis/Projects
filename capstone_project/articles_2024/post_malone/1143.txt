By the time Joe Diffie released his second album Regular Joe in 1992, he already had two No. 1 singles —”Home” and “If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)”—with more to come, including “Third Rock from the Sun”, “Pickup Man,” and “Bigger Than the Beatles.” Regular Joe gave Diffie two more hit singles, “Is It Cold in Here” and “Ships That Don’t Come In,” which both went to No. 5 on the Country chart.
Written by Dave Gibson and Paul Nelson, “Ships That Don’t Come In” follows a heart-to-heart conversation between two men talking about their hardships while celebrating the lives they’ve been fortunate to live so far.I could tell he’d had a tough lifeBy the way he sat and staredAnd me, I’d come to push and shoveSo I pulled up a chairWe talked of roads untraveledWe talked of love untrueOf strings that come unraveledWe were kings and kindred foolsAnd just when I’d hit bottomThat old man raised his glassSaid at least we’ve had our chancesThere’s those who never have
The men also raise a glass to all the soldiers, homeless, and others who never had a chance to live much.
So here’s to all the soldiersWho have ever died in vainThe insane locked up in themselvesAnd the homeless down on MainTo those who stand on empty shoresAnd spit against the windAnd those who wait foreverFor ships that don’t come inHe said it’s only life’s illusionsThat bring us to this barTo pick up these old crutchesAnd compare each other’s scars‘Cause the things we’re calling heartachesHell, they’re hardly worth our timeWe bitch about a dollarWhen there’s those without a dimeAs he ordered one last roundHe said, I guess we can’t complain‘Cause God made life a gambleAnd we’re still in the game“That is definitely one of my favorites,” said Diffie of the ballad. “It is a very pointed song, it has alot of deep meaning to it and it means a lot of different things to different people. I really love singing that song.”
Shortly before Toby Keith‘s death on February 5, 2024, at 64, he collaborated with Hardy on a cover of Diffie’s “Ships That Don’t Come In,” also featuring Luke Combs. The song was released on Hardy’s tribute album to Diffie Hixtape: Vol. 3: Difftape in March of 2024 and a video of Keith recording it in the studio was released later in the year. Hardy’s tribute to Diffie, who died March 29, 2020, at 61, due to complications of the coronavirus, also features renditions of his songs interpreted by Reba McEntire, Post Malone, Lainey Wilson, Jon Pardi, Morgan Wallen, Old Dominion, Luke Bryan, Clint Black, Darius Rucker, and more.
