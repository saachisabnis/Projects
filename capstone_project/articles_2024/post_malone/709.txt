THE JAM FOR SUMMER 2024 JUST DROPPED BABY!
“Got a dog at the wheel, cutoff jeans truck!”
John Lennon himself couldn’t have written more profound lyrics.
Honestly, I kind of scoffed at people who seem overly concerned about AI taking over our world*. Specifically the creative world. Books, papers, newspaper articles, song writing, no way AI can duplicate what the human mind can come up with. Then I listened to the above video. Good luck to the songwriters in Nashville if AI is cranking out fire like this. I fully expect AI to win Songwriter of the Year at the CMA’s in November if it continues on this path. Can’t wait to play this every 44 minutes on B93 for the duration of the summer.
“Got a beer in my beer and a Chevy in my truck!”
*When AI can create a morning show host who has a Seinfeld reference for everythign and terrible gambling picks, then I”ll be worried about my job.
PS: An underrated part of this entire video is the ‘plainative whines’ label on the lowest piece of audio in the multi-track. Brilliant.
Double PS: When people ask me why we play some of the music that we do on B93 (and some of it truly isn’t that different than this AI song) the answer is almost always: Money. “Why do you play the Post Malone/Morgan Wallen song so much?? It’s not country.” That may be, but the answer is: It makes money. Money. Money. Money.
