The wait is finally over as the NCAA 2024 football season kicks on Saturday when Florida State takes on Georgia Tech in Dublin, Ireland. Besides fans gearing up for another season of college football, many fans noticed a new theme song for College GameDay. While Jelly Roll continues to expand his stardom in country music, it appears the singer is looking to take over college football. Having shared his love for the sport in the past, the country singer watched as his voice became the anthem for College GameDay. 
Jelly Roll helped kickstart a new college football season on Saturday as his song “Get By” premiered as the show’s new anthem, via ESPN. Featured on his Beautifully Broken album, the song played across ESPN’s network. As one would expect, Jelly Roll’s new theme song had college football fans buzzing—or as one fan so perfectly put it, “Ready to run through a wall!!”
“Yeah ah, this is SICK. Well done. LETS GOOOO,” another fan commented. “So hyped” another chimed in. 
Discussing the addition of Jelly Roll into the ESPN family, the vice president of marketing, Curtis Friends, explained the connection between music and football. “There’s a powerful connection between music and college football, and for more than a decade, the ESPN college football music anthem has been integral to the promotion of the sport while its release has marked the unofficial start to the season.”

As for his thoughts on using a song from Jelly Roll, Friends continued, “Jelly Roll is a talented, award-winning artist whose music speaks to the passion of college football fans across the country, and we’re excited ‘Get By’ will soundtrack the sport all season long.”
Throughout the years, GameDay used songs from artists like Post Malone, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Imagine Dragons, and even Fall Out Boy. Always looking to keep the show fresh, GameDay looked to change it up with a little country
Besides nurturing a relationship with ESPN, Jelly Roll gained praise from fans for “Get By”. With the song shared on YouTube, the video quickly climbed over 100,000 views. Fans commented on the post, writing, “Can’t wait to see Jellyrolls version of Graceland! No more tours because people will travel there to see him while new acts beg to open for him! I BELIEVE!” Another person added, “When its all said and done ALL THE GREATS will be in his SHADOW! JUST F**KING BRILLIANT! 🇺🇸.”
