Post Malone certainly doesn’t seem to be feeling too tortured after his poetic collaboration with Taylor Swift on the first single from her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
Malone co-wrote “Fortnight” with Swift, and performed on the track and in the moody music video, which premiered Friday, the same day Swift released her double album.

In an Instagram post on Sunday, Malone shared a solemn monochromatic shot of the two hanging out in the studio and expressed his love for Swift.
“It’s once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world,” he wrote. “I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey 🥹 I love you so much. Thank you Tay.”
He has plenty to be grateful for: Beyond that heart and mind he mentioned, Swift also pulled Malone along with her to a new streaming record. As of Friday, according to a message from Spotify on X (formerly Twitter), “Fortnight” is the most-streamed song in a single day in the service’s history.
Of the 31 tracks total across The Tortured Poets Department, which Swift announced in a surprise move was actually a double album, expanding from the originally announced 16 tracks with four more bonus songs across variants of the physical album, only two songs feature another artist. In addition to Malone’s “Fortnight” feature, the track “Florida!!!” has guest vocals and songwriting credit from Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine.
Online discourse frequently pits Swift against Beyoncé, recently working into a vigorous lather this summer when the two simultaneously staged successful world tours and released concert films around those tours in quick succession, and as far back as the 2009 MTV VMAs, when Kanye West crashed Swift's acceptance speech to talk about how great Bey's work was. The releases of Tortured Poets and Cowboy Carter being so close together has fueled the fan duels. Malone, however, shows that being a fan of and working with these two top artists are not mutually exclusive. Malone is featured on Beyoncé’s “LEVII’S JEANS,” also released recently.
Malone also posted a tribute to Bey on his grid after her album's release, sharing a photo of her album cover with a succinct caption: “i love you @beyonce”
