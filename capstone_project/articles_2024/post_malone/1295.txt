Taylor Swift announced the fourth and final variant of her upcoming album The Tortured Poets Department Sunday at her second Eras Tour show in Singapore: “The Black Dog.”

	During the Surprise Songs portion of the show, following the debut live performance of Evermore‘s “Long Story Short,” Swift revealed the fourth and final edition of her upcoming album, out April 19.

	“The Black Dog” joins “The Manuscript,” “The Bolter,” and “The Albatross” as variant-exclusive bonus tracks for The Tortured Poets Department. Like the previous editions, “The Black Dog” variant features unique packaging and photos in addition to the bonus track, and like its predecessors, it’s only available for a limited time: Fans can preorder “The Black Dog” edition now through March 6th at Swift’s webstore.

	Swift revealed her new album at the 2024 Grammys when she took the stage to accept the award for Best Pop Vocal Album (Midnights). The fact that it marks her 13th Grammy win (her lucky number) caused fans to speculate that Swift would make an announcement. (Her backup plan, if she didn’t win, was announcing TTPD at her Tokyo concerts.)

	“Tortured Poets is an album,” Swift told a Melbourne, Australia audience in February, “I think more than any of my albums that I’ve ever made, I needed to make it. It was really a lifeline for me. Just the things I was going through and the things I was writing about. It kind of reminded me of why songwriting was something that actually gets me through my life.”

	Swift also previously shared the album’s 16-song (plus bonus track) track list, which includes features from Post Malone and Florence + the Machine.
