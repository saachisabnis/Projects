At midnight (April 4), Beyoncé launched a new remix of her chart-topping single “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM.” The standout cut from COWBOY CARTER got updated with fresh, new energy and additional lyrics.
“Woke up this morning, my heart keeps racing/ Straight to the bottom, we all need salvation/ Need you to end this drought, take me downtown,” she sings on the updated track. “Gon’ leave the truck, whiskey, baby/ Let’s get weekend wasted/ Might as well just throw it all/ And pony up, don’t hold back on me.”
Notably, the original musical offering made Beyoncé the first Black woman to lead Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, marking her 13th Hot 100 No. 1. Listen to “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM (PONY UP REMIX)” below.
