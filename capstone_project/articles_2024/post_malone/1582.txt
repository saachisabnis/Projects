Post Malone is back with another massive week on Billboard’s charts, thanks to his new album F-1 Trillion.

	The set launches at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (dated Aug. 31) with 250,000 equivalent album units earned in its opening week, according to Luminate. That’s the second-biggest week of 2024 for a country album, following the opening frame of Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter (407,000 units) in April. F-1 Trillion also becomes Post Malone’s first No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart.

	All 18 songs from F-1 Trillion’s standard edition chart on the Billboard Hot 100 – including all 15 collaborations – led by former six-week No. 1 “I Had Some Help” at No. 2. Here’s a recap (all of which are debuts except where noted):

	(The standard edition of F-1 Trillion was released on Aug. 16 and sports 18 songs. Later on Aug. 16, Post Malone released a deluxe reissue, dubbed the “Long Bed” edition, with nine additional solo tracks by the singer.)

	Post Malone also charts a 19th song on the latest Hot 100: Taylor Swift’s former two-week No. 1 “Fortnight,” on which he’s featured, ranks at No. 55. The haul marks a new weekly best, surpassing his 18 entries on May 12, 2018, when his album beerbongs & bentleys made its chart arrival.

	With 15 debuts, Post Malone ups his career total to 95 career Hot 100 entries. Of those, 48 have reached the top 40, 13 have made the top 10 and six have hit No. 1. He first appeared on the chart dated Sept. 26, 2015, with his breakthrough hit “White Iverson.”

	Multiple guests on F-1 Trillion make notable visits to the Hot 100. Thanks to his feature on “Finer Things,” Hank Williams Jr. tallies his fourth career entry on the chart, and first since “A Country Boy Can Survive (Y2K Version),” with Chad Brock and George Jones, in 2000. Before that, he had last charted in 1964 with “Long Gone Lonesome Blues” and “Endless Sleep.” “Finer Things,” at No. 42, is now the highest-charting song of his career.

	










	With her role on “Have the Heart,” Dolly Parton adds her 22nd career Hot 100 hit and second this year, after “Tyrant,” with Beyoncé. Before that, she had last charted via her featured turn on Brad Paisley’s “When I Get Where I’m Going” in 2006. This marks the first calendar year that Parton has charted multiple songs since 1985, when she logged two duets with Kenny Rogers—“The Greatest Gift of All” and “Real Love.”

	Plus, Billy Strings scores his first career Hot 100 entry thanks to his featured appearance on “M-E-X-I-C-O.” The 31-year-old bluegrass star has already forged a successful history on Billboard’s rankings, including seven career entries on the Bluegrass Albums chart:

Peak Position, Title, YearNo. 3, Turmoil & Tinfoil, 2017No. 1 (25 weeks), Home, 2019No. 10, An OurVinyl Sessions (EP), 2019No. 1 (9 weeks), Renewal, 2021No. 1 (16 weeks), Me / And / Dad, 2022No. 6, Meet Me at the Creek / Pyramid Country / Must Be Seven / Meet Me at the Creek (Live at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Winston-Salem, NC 3/4/23), 2023No. 1 (5 weeks), Live, Vol. 1, 2024

	He has spent 55 total weeks at No. 1 on the Bluegrass Albums chart in his career (encompassing the No. 1 runs of his four leaders). That’s the fifth-most since the list launched in 2002, after Alison Krauss (242), Steve Martin (83), Nickel Creek (82) and Old Crow Medicine Show (66).

	Three of his albums have also reached the Billboard 200: Renewal (No. 82 peak), Me / And / Dad (No. 37) and Live, Vol. 1 (No. 58). He has also raked in six Grammy Award nominations, winning for best bluegrass album in 2021 for Home.
