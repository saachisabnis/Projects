Mobile gaming platform Backbone One has just launched an all-new collaboration with Grammy Award-nominated musician, Post Malone — and they’ve unveiled a limited edition controller that highlights Malone’s unique style, personality, and the crossover between music and gaming.
Designed with direct input from the in-house Backbone team, the limited edition controller features upgraded styling and details that match Post Malone’s iconic brand. The styling is obvious at first glance, with a bold green translucent color (Post Malone’s favorite), while an upgraded aluminum D-pad and laser-etched ABYX buttons are also included. Additionally, the hand-assembled, sequentially numbered premium packaging includes a glow-in-the-dark Post Malone logo.
Limited to only 500 units, you can check out the new Backbone One Post Malone Limited Edition Controller above. It will be available for purchase directly from Backbone’s website from June 25 at 9 a.m. PST.
