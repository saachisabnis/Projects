On Friday (October 23), Joe Walsh announced on Instagram that the upcoming 2024 VetsAid Concert set to take place at UBS Arena in Belmont Park, New York on November 11 has been canceled “due to circumstances beyond organizers’ control.”  Despite the cancellation of the benefit show, VetsAid still promises to disburse $400,000 to the already announced grant recipients. “I am disappointed in the cancellation of this year’s event and apologize for any inconvenience to our fans,” Walsh wrote. But the former Eagles member and solo legend was proud to share that $400,000 will still benefit a series of “fine organizations who will focus these funds on the ground in New York and New Jersey to veterans who have sacrificed so much and asked for so little in return.“ In addition to Walsh’s set, the 2024 VetsAid Concert was going to feature performances from Post Malone, Eric Church, Toto, and Kool & the Gang.
