At a special songwriters-in-the-round at Nashville’s legendary Bluebird Cafe on June 17, Lainey Wilson performed her new song, “4x4xU” in front of a live audience for the first time. The track was so new that she needed her friend – and fellow performer that evening – Post Malone to hold her cellphone so she could read the lyrics off the screen. “I didn’t even know the chords. I was just making them up that night,” Wilson recalls of the song’s debut live performance in front of 90 lucky country fans at the intimate venue. That track is now Wilson’s current single from her new album, Whirlwind, and it continues a trend set by her past hits “Heart Like a Truck” and “Wait in the Truck.” “For so long, I was like, ‘I’m not going to write about trucks,’” Wilson says. “That’s what everybody does. [But] every single one of my biggest songs is about a damn truck. I couldn’t help it, but I guess you just write what you know.” (Billboard)
