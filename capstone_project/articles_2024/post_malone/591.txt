Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album is a massive, dynamic project that quite literally defies genre.
It includes her very first country music hit, but the three Country Music Hall of Famers she features may be more important.
Actually, one could argue that the six country newcomers she teams up with on this album are most important.
Cowboy Carter began as a deep dive into the history of Black country music. Linda Martell's presence helps shepherd the singer and fans through the 27-song experience, but she gets a big assist from the likes of Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson.

Post Malone joins Bey for an eye-popping, sexy song called "Levii's Jeans" ("Boy, I"ll let you be my Levi jeans / So you can hug that ass all day long"), and Miley Cyrus appears for an unexpected love song called "II Most Wanted."
Country fans may want to skip right to the cover of Parton's "Jolene," however. "Cover" may not be the right word here, as the singer appears anything but intimidated by the presence of a beautiful woman tempting her man.
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene / I'm warning you, woman, find you your own man," Beyoncé sings. "Jolene, I know I'm a queen, Jolene / I'm still a Creole b---h from Louisianne."
Below are 16 Easter eggs — or things to listen for — throughout Cowboy Carter, beginning with the scope of Bey's collaborations.
