The ‘Stick Season’ singer made an unexpected stop at this Pine Tree State pizza staple over Labor Day weekend.
Between selling out stadiums, making international trips, getting into the studio, and throwing some less-than-perfect first pitches, Noah Kahan managed to sneak in a surprise visit to this beloved Pine Tree State pizza spot over Labor Day weekend.
Singer-songwriter Noah Kahan, known for his hit songs like ‘Stick Season’ and ‘Dial Drunk’ with Post Malone, originally from Vermont, has gained a huge following around the country, but especially here in the Northeast with his heartfelt lyrics and New England-inspired music.
Often called 'the cathedral' of New England, Fenway Park was the grand finale of Noah Kahan’s latest string of projects. To celebrate, he released a new live album, ‘Live From Fenway Park,’ recorded during these legendary performances. This album marks the end of his successful and critically acclaimed tour. Released on August 30th, it captures the energy of his unforgettable nights at Fenway, and to be fair, there have been many ‘unforgettable’ nights in that ballpark.
Over Labor Day Weekend, Noah Kahan stopped by OTTO’s South Portland location. The popular pizza spot shared a photo of the singer posing inside. Their caption read, 'THANK YOU @noahkahanmusic for visiting our South Portland location yesterday! We definitely called our mom about it,' a fun nod to Kahan’s song 'Call Your Mom.'
What would you do if you ran into a famous person while just trying to grab a slice? Would you play it cool or totally fangirl?
