Everything that Rocks the River City
Today (March 29), Beyonce dropped her new country album Cowboy Carter and one of its songs, "Bodyguard," features a lyrical reference to mosh pits.
While the album is of the country music variety, it hits on multiple cultural touchstones, including a cover of The Beatles' "Blackbird," a guest appearances by Post Malone, Willie Nelson and Miley Cyrus, as well as a cover of Dolly Parton's all-time hit "Jolene."
Most unexpectedly, however, is that aforementioned shoutout to moshing.

"Bodyguard," the eighth of 27 total tracks on the record, deals with the idea of emotional and physical protection of someone of romantic interest.
Opening the second verse, Beyonce sings, "Be your best friend / I protect you in the mosh pit," followed by the rhyme, "And I'll defend you in the gossip / You know how people like to start shit and pop shit."
