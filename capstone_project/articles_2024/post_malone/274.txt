TTPD definitely isn’t winning AOTY which isn’t surprising cause this album seemed rushed and thrown together. I also want to know who told her that the anthology was a good idea because that overshadowed the standard edition with lackluster songs (there’s maybe 3 that are actually decent).
I wonder what will win AOTY, I know y’all are banking on Billie but I just don’t see it lmao. This really might be Beyoncé’s year

 I hope not. Cowboy Carter is just atrocious. So boring and all over the place

I just don’t think beyonce will ever win AOTY sorry…Billie seems to be the main contender
Get real!  It is never Beyoncé’s year.  That yeehaw mess Cowboy Carter is NOT winning Album of the Year.
The Jack Antonoff hate makes us so incredibly angry. TTPD is a masterpiece, and the bottom line is that the songs that he and Taylor write together are deeply personal, raw and vulnerable and Taylor obviously trusts him wholeheartedly with her art and her feelings.

Well, Billie’s album isn’t out. But, is she delivers a decent album, she’s easily the frontrunner.

Like everyone knows she ain’t winning. Like even now she clocked it from her cussing them. She should have at least 2 by now. My issue is they say Beyoncé is over rewarded but give Taylor 4 AOTY and Billie 2xsong nd record but we all know why she won’t win. Billie or vampire are winning

I also don’t think vampire is winning at all…billie album might not be out yet but it’s already the main frontrunner it’s kinda crazy when you think about it

We say this every year… and it never happens.
TTPD got a 6.6 on Pitchfork while the Anthology got a 6… If this wins AOTY I swear lmao
Yet Pitchfork has been predicting the Grammy AOTY winner wrong for three straight years already since 2022 when SOUR was supposed to win only for Jon Batiste to pull an upset win.

As of now I don’t predict Taylor to win anything. TTPD has no big acclaim and I don’t think numbers will be enough to win AOTY two years in a row. I also don’t see it winning Best Pop Vocal Album. Pop voters won’t support this kind of alt pop snoozefest. Her best shot might be Best Pop Duo/Group Performance but considering she’s weak in performance categories and Post Malone is not liked by voters I could see it losing to The Beatles or the Beyoncé x Miley collab if submitted.
I think TTPD would be the obvious choice if billie album is underperforming…but otherwise billie all the way

Remember that the Grammys voters pool will be the same like last year but there will be some new voters.

As long as Billie doesn’t fuck up the rollout, she’s coming for that AOTY. And if she gets a big hit, a sweep as well. Would never underestimate her awards love.
