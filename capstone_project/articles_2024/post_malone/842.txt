Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department has started to appear on music charts all around the world, and so too have the songs featured on the project. The set’s lead single has also become a huge hit, and as it arrives, the pop singer pulls ahead of one of the biggest stars in history in one country.
Lead The Tortured Poets Department single “Fortnight” launches atop the ARIA songs chart in Australia, bringing Swift back to the summit. She’s joined by featured artist Post Malone, who earns his fourth winner in the nation–though Swift’s count is much, much higher.
“Fortnight” marks her twelfth No. 1 single in Australia, and this latest win has indeed turned out to be very lucky for her. Swift pulls out of her tie with Madonna for the most leaders of all time in the country among women.
Swift is now sitting in third place among all artists when it comes to the most No. 1 songs in Australia. She’s just two champions behind Elvis Presley, who managed 14 throughout his entire career.
The Beatles continue to lead all acts, and they may never be matched. The British rockers accrued 26 No. 1 singles in Australia–more than twice as many as Swift.
“Fortnight” is far from the only new hit from Swift on the Australian chart this week. Tunes from The Tortured Poets Department occupy the entire top 10 on the ranking, giving the singer 10 new top 10 smashes Down Under.
Looking at the top 50 on the ARIA songs chart, Swift’s name appears in 29 spots. That’s a record among all acts, and it further shows just how massively popular she–and The Tortured Poets Department–are in the nation.
