Taylor Swift has once again surprised fans by dropping the Dombresky remix of her track “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” today (Sept. 13).

	It’s been a whirlwind week for Swift, who not only endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election but also won seven awards at the 2024 VMAs, which were held at UBS Arena in New York on Wednesday (Sept. 11). 

	At the awards show on Wednesday, Swift scored Video of the Year award for “Fortnight,” a track from The Tortured Poets Department featuring Post Malone. This brings the singer-songwriter’s career total of Moonpersons to an even 30, which enables her to tie Beyoncé as the top winner in the show’s history.

The Tortured Poets Department has been an extraordinary commercial success, solidifying Swift’s reign on the Billboard charts. The album, which marks her 14th No. 1, ties her with Jay-Z for the most No. 1 albums by a solo artist. With only The Beatles ahead of her with 19 No. 1s, Swift continues to break records while exploring new creative territories.

	Meanwhile “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”, the album’s second single, opened and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Global 200 chart, and placed within the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
