SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - Trailer Trash will, once again, take the stage at The Plaza at MGM Springfield for Free Music Friday.
“We’re local guys. We’ve been here our whole lives and I can’t imagine a better music scene than what’s around here right now,” said Trailer Trash guitarist Bob Stanek.
Trailer Trash has been performing at MGM Springfield since the venue opened a few years ago and, this Friday, they will do just that again.
“It’s always thrilling to look out and see a bunch of people that we know and see some new faces and see that plaza full. It’s very energizing and it’s kind of neat to give that back in the performance,” added Trailer Trash keyboardist Jeff Decarli.
The band has been together since 2011, playing modern country music as well as covers from well-known artists, such as Alice In Chains and Metallica. Its members come from Springfield, Chicopee, and East Longmeadow and they balance their music careers with their full-time jobs. In fact, one of the things they love about what they do is performing in their own style.
“We’re fortunate enough to be a bunch of guys that have the ability to do whatever we want on our instruments for the most part,” Stanek explained.
Band members told Western Mass News that those who show up Friday will be in for a good night.
“If you like jelly roll, we’re playing his latest hit songs, Post Malone’s latest hit songs, along with some classic rock. We’ve got something planned for the very first song that may or may not involve a local radio host,” Stanek noted.
The show begins at 7:30 p.m. and you are advised to show up at least an hour early.
