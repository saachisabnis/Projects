IDER, Ala. (WAFF) - The Ider Police Department wants to help families in need get car seats for their children in Jackson and DeKalb counties. 
Ider Police Chief Stephen Malone says officers who have conducted traffic stops have noticed many families that were unable to afford car seats. 
Malone says that instead of ticketing these individuals, two families have received free car seats through the department’s new program.
Malone says the program is solely funded by donations from officers, town council and community members. 
“The last thing we want is a child to be injured due to financial constraints of a family member or guardian,” Malone wrote in a post. 
He says the department now has six car seats left ready for donation. If you are in need please follow the application process: 
Please email Iderchief@farmerstel.com , or private message the Ider Police Department Facebook page with the following information: 
1. Name.
2. Current address.
3. Child’s name, Date of birth, and weight.
4. Relationship to the child receiving the car seat. 
5. A brief summary on the circumstances of the situation. (This will help us determine who is a higher candidate due to limited resources). 
***All applications will remain private. 
“Please understand and remember, there will be more need than we can provide for everyone, but we at the Town of Ider are committed to providing the most we can out of our own personal resources to support everyone in need,” Malone wrote in a post. 
If you would like to make a monetary donation or donate a car seat, visit Ider Town Hall.
