(TND) â€” The Country Music Association announced its nominations for the 58th CMA Awards leaving out "Queen Bey."
Beyonce, who released her first country album earlier this year, "Cowboy Carter" was left off the list.
Her song, "Texas Hold 'Em," went No. 1 on Billboard's "Hot Country Songs" chart and "Cowboy Carter" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard "Hot 100 chart," having her become the first black woman to lead Top Country Albums.
While this was Beyonce's first entrance into the country music sector, it is not the first time she felt unwelcome by country music. In 2016, Beyonce performed her song "Daddy Lessons" with the Chicks (formerly the Dixie Chicks) at the CMAs, getting booed on stage during her surprise performance.
Beyonce explored the genre of country music and brought a wider recognition to Black artists in the country music genre with "Cowboy Carter," giving her the second-biggest album opening of the year and topping the charts for two weeks. Regardless of those feats, she got little play time on country music radio despite the success of her hit, "Texas Hold 'Em."
Regardless of the wide success of "Cowboy Carter" as a country music album, it did not translate into a nomination at the CMAs this year.
The CMAs will be hosted at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on November 20.
Morgan Wallen tops the list with seven nominations at the CMAs, including entertainer of the year. Cody Johnson and Chris Stapleton each have five nominations, and Lainey Wilson and Post Malone, new to the country music scene, each have four nominations.
