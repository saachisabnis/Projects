This is absolutely the year for music in America.  Actually, scratch that.  It's the year for incredible live music in Rockford, Illinois.
So the Hard Rock Casino opened in Rockford over Labor Day weekend and major acts performed; Akon, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, and Brad Paisley.  Well, after those acts were announced, one of my favorite artists dropped news he's also performing in Rockford.  Can you guess who it is?
I'll give you a few hints: He's on the rise, one of the hottest artists in music right now, and has a voice that's so raspy, so much emotion behind it that it'd literally bring you to tears.  He also looks like a big teddy bear.
Yup, you guessed it: Teddy Swims!
I’ve been following Teddy's music for a while now, and his unique style—melding soul, R&B, and a bit of pop—makes his shows a must-see for me.
I was stoked to see Akon at the Hard Rock Live on opening weekend, but I never thought in a million years we'd get Teddy Swims!!!  He's on my concert bucket list.
#1 is Benson Boone
#2 is Teddy Swims
#3 is Post Malone
I think Posty is too big of a star to perform at such an intimate venue in Rockford... but at the right price, maybe.  Just maybe.  Benson Boone would totally come, though.  I hope to cross all three of them off my bucket list by the end of 2025!
If you haven’t heard Teddy's stuff yet, think soulful vibes combined with a powerful stage presence—basically, the kind of show where you’ll leave feeling like you’ve just witnessed something unmatched.
I'll be crying in the crowd on September 20th... don't mind me.
