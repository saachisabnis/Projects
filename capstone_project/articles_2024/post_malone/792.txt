Post Malone's new country album F-1 Trillion is set to arrive in just a few weeks and so far he's remained pretty tight-lipped about the full tracklist. Enter, Target. The retail giant reportedly accidentally leaked the songs list for the project on it's pre-order page. While the photos are no longer on the site, that didn't stop some fans from snapping a screenshot of what they saw.
And what they saw were some pretty major country collaborations.
Malone has already released a handful of country collaborations — "I Had Some Help" with Morgan Wallen, "Pour Me a Drink" featuring Blake Shelton and the newly-released "Guy for That" alongside Luke Combs.
The album artwork shared by Target shows the rest of the country roster included on the project. Hardy, Brad Paisley, Billy Strings, Dolly Parton and Lainey Wilson are on the list. Sierra Ferrell, Jelly Roll and Tim McGraw are also featured as well as Chris Stapleton, Ernest and Hank Williams Jr.
F1-Trillion is scheduled to be released on Aug. 16 and with this news, it has now been confirmed to be his country collection. Along with these songs, it's likely he'll include tracks such as "She Ain't Yours," "Never Love You Again" and "Drinkin' 'Bout You" on the project. Malone has played these at some of his recent live shows.
