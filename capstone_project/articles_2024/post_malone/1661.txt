English rose, Jeorgia Rose is ‘Blooming’ with the release of her debut album; a journey that takes listeners through familiar stories of heartbreak and new-found confidence but crafted over a modern mix of country and pop. 
The release of a full collection of songs confirms that Jeorgia Rose understands that there’s more out there than traditional romance. “This album is about the stage after heartbreak where you thought you’d never be okay without someone, but you’ve come out the other side and life is now blooming,” she says. “It’s a representation of things I’ve experienced in the last few years of my life growing from a teenager into an adult.”
