Post Malone went to great lengths to create the cover art for his new F-1 Trillion album. To get the perfect shot of a truck appearing to stand on its nose over a body of water, they dropped an actual truck into some water.
And now, you can see the 1971 blue Ford pickup on display in Dallas, Texas.
The truck used for Malone's album has found a temporary home in front of a Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers in Dallas. The truck currently sits in the parking lot behind a velvet rope fortress.
Fans can stop by and take photos with the vehicle through Thursday (Aug. 29) and enter for a chance to win tickets to one of Malone's shows.
Prior to its arrival in the Loner Star State, the Ford was on display in Nashville. It was spotted downtown in front of Bridgestone Arena and outside of Grimey's New & Preloved Music.
According to a social media post, the truck's next destination will be another Raising Cane's in Midvale, Utah. The location is close to Malone's Salt Lake City home.
The cover art for Malone's project looks like it defies gravity. Aside from Jesus Christ himself, nothing and no one has been able to walk — or stand, for that matter — on water. This Ford pickup is no different.
Although it looks like it was made with photoshop, the F-1 Trillion artwork was created by Mexican artist Gonzalo Lebrija for the project. Using a massive crane, he and his team dropped a truck into a lake called Presa Salto del Nogal in Jalisco, Mexico. The photo was taken on April 23, 2024.
