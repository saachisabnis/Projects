Country music's hottest songs make up the Taste of Country Top 40, and this month there is nobody hotter than the genre's only Grammy performer.
Luke Combs is No. 1 in February 2024, and that's surprising, because his latest single is such a deviation from the love and heartbreak songs fans know him for. You have to stop and listen to "Where the Wild Things Are" to appreciate his storytelling, but if you get to the end, it's so worth it.
His ascension to No. 1 on the February 2024 Top 40 Country Songs list is largely a result of the fan poll. That's a new but vital element added to the list within the last few months. Make sure your voice is heard if you're not happy with the results.
