(Mercury/Republic)The latest US artist to jump on the country bandwagon duets with Dolly Parton and more on his surprisingly enjoyable sixth album
Country music is taking over. From Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter to Lana Del Rey’s forthcoming Lasso, singer-songwriters are drawing on twanging guitars, colourful storytelling and vibrato-laden vocals for their own twists on the genre. Face-tattooed SoundCloud rapper Post Malone might not seem like the most likely country star, but on his sixth album the Texas-raised artist tries his hand at cowboy crooning, enlistingcountry’s biggest names for 18 tracks of genre crossovers.
F-1 Trillion features all-time greats (Dolly Parton), young stars (Luke Combs) and controversial choices (Morgan Wallen, who was filmed shouting the N-word in 2021). Combs provides husky counterpoint to Malone’s clean tone on the sprightly Guy for That and Missin’ You Like This, while Parton is in full celebratory honky-tonk mode on Have the Heart. Yet it’s Malone’s voice that shines through, dropping the post-production processing to growl and screech on Wrong Ones and yearn on the soulful What Don’t Belong to Me.
At 18 tracks F-1 Trillion felt overlong. The addition of nine more tracks since its release makes it excessive; it’s also overly polished and missing the instrumental virtuosity central to the genre. And yet it’s surprisingly enjoyable. Malone’s country sojourn seems here to stay.
