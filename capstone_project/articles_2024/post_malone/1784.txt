Post Malone has joined the lineup for the eighth edition of Joe Walsh’s VetsAid Benefit show. The 2024 edition of the fundraising concert started by the legendary Eagles guitarist and solo star is set to take place at UBS Arena in Belmont Park, New York on November 11, Veterans Day. In addition to the high-profile performances from Malone and Walsh, the event will feature sets from previously announced special guests Eric Church, Toto, and Kool & the Gang, who will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 19. “VetsAid is for EVERYONE: fans of all ages, backgrounds and musical genres,” Walsh said in a statement. “So who better to join the party than Posty – the man who can do it all? What better way to honor our veterans and their families this Veterans Day than with a night you will never forget?” (Billboard)
