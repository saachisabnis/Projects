The National Football League (NFL) has announced country superstar Reba McEntire will perform the National Anthem at Super Bowl LVII. The Super Bowl will be taking place on Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will air on CBS.
The event marks a full circle moment for McEntire, as it has been 50 years since she was discovered while singing the national anthem at the National Rodeo Finals in 1974. “I’m honored to be part of something as big and historic as the Super Bowl coming to Las Vegas for the first time,” she shares. “2024 marks 50 years since I was discovered singing the National Anthem at the National Finals Rodeo, and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate that anniversary.”
Additional pre-game performers include Post Malone and Andra Day, before Usher will perform during the half time show.
McEntire has been preparing for her second season as a coach on NBC’s The Voice. She also recently published her book, Not That Fancy, which became a New York Times bestseller.
