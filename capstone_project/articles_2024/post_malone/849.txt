There were a lot of changes, which was anticipated, as she worked the setlist to include songs from her recently released 11th studio album.

The Tortured Poets Department, which released on April 19 during the pause in the tour, was added in after her 1989 era and before the surprise songs segment. Seven songs -- or portions of songs -- were included from TTPD:
Swift went with the black-and-white motif for the set, wearing a white gown similar to the one seen in her "Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)" music video before switching to a black glittery ensemble for the finale of the era. She also performed "loml" as the acoustic surprise song on the piano.
The new choreography and costuming was phenomenal, and TTPD fits right in with the show.
