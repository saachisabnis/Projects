Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, spends a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. The song soared in at the summit a week earlier, becoming Post Malone’s sixth leader and Wallen’s second.

	Notably, while “I Had Some Help” is the 27th hit to have topped both the Hot 100 and the Hot Country Songs chart, which shares the former’s multimetric methodology, it’s just the second to have debuted atop both tallies and logged its first two weeks on each at No. 1. It joins Oliver Anthony Music’s “Rich Men North of Richmond,” which led in its first two weeks on each list last August-September.

	Meanwhile, Billie Eilish bounds onto the Hot 100 at No. 5 with “Lunch.” The song is her sixth top 10 – and highest debut. It’s from her new album Hit Me Hard and Soft, which opens at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 1, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 29, a day later than usual due to the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S. May 27.

	Below is a rundown of the latest Hot 100’s top 10.

	“I Had Some Help,” on Mercury/Republic/Big Loud, notches a second week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, with 55 million official streams (down 28%), 42.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 36%, good for the chart’s top Airplay Gainer award) and 21,000 sold (down 70%) in the U.S. May 17-23.

	The collaboration claims a second week at No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart, dips to No. 3 from No. 1 on Streaming Songs and surges 15-9 on Radio Songs. On the lattermost list, it hits the top 10 in just its third week, completing the fastest flight to the region this year. It’s also the first song to reach the Radio Songs top 10 in as few as three weeks that has also hit the Country Airplay chart’s top 10 (dating to each chart’s 1990 inception). It pushes 9-8 on Country Airplay, as well as 20-13 on Adult Pop Airplay and 20-15 on Pop Airplay.

	Billie Eilish’s “Lunch” debuts at No. 5 on the Hot 100 with 32.8 million streams, 20.2 million in radio reach and 3,000 sold.

	The song arrives as Eilish’s sixth Hot 100 top 10 and highest debut. She previously began in the top tier with “My Future” (No. 6) and “Bad Guy” (No. 7).

Billie Eilish’s Hot 100 Top 10s:

	“Lunch” concurrently premieres at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts, becoming Eilish’s fourth leader on each ranking. It follows “What Was I Made For?,” which spent two and 19 weeks atop the charts, respectively, in 2023; “Happier Than Ever” (four at No. 1 on each in 2021); and “My Future” (one atop each in 2020).

	As previously reported, “Lunch” parent album Hit Me Hard and Soft debuts at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 339,000 equivalent album units – Eilish’s largest career week by that metric.

	Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” holds at No. 2 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at No. 1. It rebounds for a second week atop Streaming Songs (59.7 million, down 17%) and rules the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts for a third week each.

	Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” keeps at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2. It leads the multimetric Hot R&B Songs chart for a fourth week.

	Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is steady at No. 4 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 3.

	Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” shoots 9-6 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 4, and Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which led for a week in March, falls 6-7, as it tops Radio Songs for a seventh week (73.4 million in audience, down 1%).

	Benson Boone’s No. 2-peaking “Beautiful Things” descends 5-8 on the Hot 100 and Hozier’s “Too Sweet” rises 10-9, following a week at No. 1 in April, as it commands the multimetric Hot Rock Songs chart for a ninth week.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, backtracks 8-10, after spending its first two weeks on the chart at No. 1 earlier in May. It takes top Sales Gainer honors, up 480% to 19,000 sold, sparked by 15,000 CD singles that shipped during the tracking week, as well as its remix with BLOND:ISH, released May 22.
