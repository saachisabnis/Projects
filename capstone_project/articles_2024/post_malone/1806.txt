It's interesting to note that it's not just locals who love to complain about our traffic and roads.Â Rock legend and former Van Halen lead singer Sammy Hagar said in an interview that while passing through Albany in the '80s, he was pulled over for driving 62 in a 55, thinking that the highway's speed limit was 65 MPH.
Props to Sammy Hagar for traveling at 3 MPH under the speed limit at 2 a.m.
