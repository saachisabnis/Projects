The Grand Ole Opry, a Nashville staple for decades, is apparently broadening their outlook and welcoming more genres to perform onstage.
Creed frontman Scott Stapp recently made the announcement he’ll be on the Opry stage tonight (October 23rd), and he’s not the only guest from outside of its typical country genre to perform live. The Opry has also featured Post Malone, jam band Leftover Salmon, Andrew Farriss of INXS, and even retired pitcher Adam Mainwright. Jelly Roll and Aaron Lewis of Staind have also performed on the Opry Stage many times.
How far do you think they’ll expand the horizon? Read more from Billboard HERE.
