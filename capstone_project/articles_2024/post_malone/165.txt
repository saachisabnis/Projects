Reba McEntire will perform the national anthem for Super Bowl LVIII.
The Super Bowl is set to take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11th and will air on CBS.
The performance will mark a full circle moment for Reba, who was discovered 50 years ago at the 1974 National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma when she sang the national anthem, launching her iconic career.
“I’m honored to be part of something as big and historic as the Super Bowl coming to Las Vegas for the first time. 2024 marks 50 years since I was discovered singing the National Anthem at the National Finals Rodeo, and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate that anniversary.”
Along with Reba, pre-game talent for the Super Bowl includes Post Malone and Andra Day with Usher performing at halftime.
