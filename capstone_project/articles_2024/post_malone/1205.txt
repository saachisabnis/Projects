With Oasis getting back together, a British tabloid resurrected a story about the night Courtney Love COULD HAVE had sex with Liam Gallagher.
She told the story back in 2014. They were hanging out, and he kinda floated the idea. She says, quote, "I mean, he was lovely but he had really bad breath from being up all night and his eyebrows kind of met in the middle.
"And I just thought he looked like a 13th century serf from Monty Python. And I blurted it out loud."
