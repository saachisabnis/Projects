It is finally here! Post Malone Maine Monday. Posty will be taking over Maine Savings Amphitheater in Bangor while playing all of his country songs that we have been devouring incessantly for months!
Will he have special guests? Will he attend the after party (see below) in Bangor? Will he sing every single off the F-1 Trillion album? Will he sing some of his older stuff outside of the country music genre?
Those answers will be revealed soon enough. There are, however, two things that we do know for certain right now. One, it is going to be one of the most memorable shows ever to hit the Bangor Waterfront, and two, there are a lot of people who still need tickets.
David and CindyÂ on Q106.5 have been given a pair of lawn tickets to attend the show at Maine Savings Amphitheater, and as much as they would love to attend the concert of the year here in Maine, they both know someone would appreciate them far more than they would, and for David and Cindy, making someone smile is much more satisfying than any concert.
It's very easy to win these pair of tickets. You just need to listen to David and Cindy Monday morning on Q106.5. Because you read this far, you are about to get a jumpstart on your phone dialing, concert loving nemeses.
David and Cindy will be giving the tickets away at 8:41am during Monday's show. You'll just need be caller #10 to win!
