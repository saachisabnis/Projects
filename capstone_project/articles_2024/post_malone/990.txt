Cowboy Carter, the latest album by Beyoncé, has been submitted for the 2025 Grammy Awards in the country category. The decision follows her notable absence from the 2024 Country Music Awards (CMA) and People’s Choice Country Awards, where she received zero nominations despite Cowboy Carter being one of the year’s biggest releases.
This marks Beyoncé’s first official foray into the country genre at the Grammys, a genre she’s long admired. Her previous attempt to compete with her 2017 song “Daddy Lessons” was rejected by the Recording Academy. Fans hope this submission will bring her long-deserved recognition in country music. Cowboy Carter has already made history, with its lead single, “Texas Hold ‘Em,” becoming the first song by a Black woman to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart.
“It’s exciting to see Beyoncé finally get her due in country music,” said a fan on social media. “Cowboy Carter deserved so much more love at the CMAs and People’s Choice, and maybe the Grammys will get it right.”
Record-Breaking Success
Despite snubs in country-specific awards, Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter has been a commercial triumph. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling over 407,000 album units in its first week, a record for 2024 at the time. “This album blends genres in a way only Beyoncé can, but country is at its core,” said a representative from her team.
With potential Grammy competitors like Post Malone, Kacey Musgraves, and Chris Stapleton, the country category will be fiercely competitive. However, given Beyoncé’s influence and Cowboy Carter’s success, many expect her to make a strong showing.
“Beyoncé’s always been about breaking boundaries,” said country music critic Amanda Hayes. “This could be the moment where the genre finally opens its doors wider, embracing a more diverse range of artists.”
The 67th Grammy Awards will take place in February 2025, and all eyes will be on whether Cowboy Carter secures Beyoncé’s spot in country music history.
