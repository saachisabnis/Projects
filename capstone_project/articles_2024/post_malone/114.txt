After they covered each other, could we be getting a Noah Kahan/Olivia Rodrigo collaboration?
In an interview with Variety, the “vampire” star shares that she wants to duet with the “Dial Drunk” artist.
“I think he’s so great and he’s very inspiring,” Rodrigo says of Kahan. According to Variety, Rodrigo then crossed her fingers before declaring, “One of these days.”
Rodrigo covered Kahan’s single “Stick Season” during an October appearance on BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge; Kahan then returned the favor with a rendition of Rodrigo’s song “lacy.”
Kahan, of course, is no stranger to collaborations and has recently teamed up with artists including Hozier, Post Malone, Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves.
