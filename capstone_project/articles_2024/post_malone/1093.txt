In a new interview with Vanity Fair published Wednesday (July 3), the Footloose alum installed the help of a special effects makeup artist, had consultations, and had a prosthetic disguise made to make his dream come true.
“I’m not complaining, but I have a face that’s pretty recognizable," the award-winning actor told the publication. Wearing a hat and glasses only goes so far when he has such a famous face.
Bacon wore a prosthetic nose, fake teeth, and glasses to the Los Angeles' popular The Grove shopping complex. Astounded, the disguise worked -- a little too well. No one recognized him, and he recalled they were pushing past him.
He joked, "Nobody said, ‘I love you.' I had to wait in line to, I don’t know, buy a f---ing coffee or whatever. I was like, ‘This sucks. I want to go back to being famous.'"
A week ago, the actor posted a video strolling around New York City, wearing a hat. Heading to the subway station, Bacon slipped on a face mask to go further into incognito mode. He added that he is a "subway stander," while his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, prefers to sit.
After he emerged from the train back on to the sidewalk, a fan called out to him and he panned his camera towards the fan, smiling afterwards. One person commented, "Just Kevin Bacon walking around like he's not famous. Love seeing the people's reactions to spotting him!"
Bacon stars in both Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, which is now streaming on Netflix, and MaXXXine, which hits theaters Friday (July 5). Bacon appearing in an action-comedy and horror film in the same week has him feeling "very grateful for where I happen to be," he told Vanity Fair. For both completely different films and roles, the actor said he has "fought really long and hard for it."
With a whopping 110 acting roles under his belt and a career in acting that began nearly 50 years ago, Bacon shows no signs of slowing down.
The actor is also set to star in two television projects, The Bondsman and Sirens, as well as a film titled Connescence. Connescence will also star his wife and marks the first time the couple starred in a role together for 20 years, since they acted alongside each other in 2004's Cavedweller and The Woodsman.
People born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.
Leos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.
