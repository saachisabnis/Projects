Taylor Swift is back to her record-breaking business. The 34-year-old songstress has shattered a number of records since releasing her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and its lead single, "Fortnight" featuring Post Malone, on April 19. 
Billboard announced on Monday that Swift had set an unprecedented record on its Hot 100 songs chart, with her Tortured Poets Department tracks occupying the top 14 slots. Led by "Fortnight" in the No. 1 spot, other top 10 songs include "Down Bad," "I Can Do It With a Broken Heart," the title track, "So Long, London" and "Florida!!!" featuring Florence + the Machine. Swift has now surpassed her own previously held record as the only artist to ever hold court over the chart's entire top 10 when she did it with Midnights back in 2022. 
"You've outdone yourselves," Swift wrote in a message to her fans on her Instagram Story. "This is unbelievable." 
This after Billboard previously announced on Sunday that TTPD had made a historic debut atop its Billboard 200 albums chart with 2.61 million equivalent album units earned in the U.S. for its opening week. The album sold more than 1.9 million copies across traditional formats, including digital downloads, CDs, vinyl, and cassettes, and generated more than 891 million on-demand streams. 
The outlet noted that, with 859,000 copies of the album sold on vinyl, it is the largest sales week for an album in that format in the modern era.
Swift has now earned her 14th chart topper, extending her own record for the most No. 1 albums for a female artist and tying Jay-Z's record for the most No. 1s by a solo artist. When it comes to all-time No. 1s, The Beatles still hold that record with a whopping 19. 
As for streaming, Billboard added that TTPD has been streamed more times in one week than any other album in history. 
Swift took to Instagram on Sunday to thank her fans for the massive launch. 
"My mind is blown. I’m completely floored by the love you’ve shown this album," she captioned her post, sharing a collection of behind-the-scenes pics from recording the album. "2.6 million ARE YOU ACTUALLY SERIOUS?? Thank you for listening, streaming, and welcoming Tortured Poets into your life. Feeling completely overwhelmed. I was already so fired up to get back to the tour but you doing THIS?? May 9th can’t come soon enough 🤍"
Swift will resume her Eras Tour on May 9 in Paris. 
Last week, Spotify announced that The Tortured Poets Department has become the first album in the streaming service's history to have more than 300 million streams in a single day. Additionally, "Fortnight" had become the most-streamed song in a single day in Spotify history. 
Swift broke her own record as the most-streamed artist in a single day in Spotify history, following the success of 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October 2023. Today, she holds the top three spots among Spotify's most-streamed albums in a single day with TTPD, Midnights, and 1989 (Taylor's Version), according to a company press release. 
Then, on April 22, TTPD became Spotify's most-streamed album in a single week. The album has surpassed 1 billion streams since its release.
The accolades continued over on Amazon Music, where The Tortured Poets Department also became the most-streamed album in its first day. On Apple Music, The Tortured Poets Department broke the record for biggest pop album of all time by first day streams.
Billboard previously reported that Swift's TTPD had sold 1.4 million copies --  including CD, vinyl, cassette and digital download versions -- in its first day alone. 
For additional context, Swift has debuted at No. 1 on the chart with every original and rerecorded album since her sophomore effort, Fearless, in 2008. She has now topped her own previous best-selling debut, 1989 (Taylor's Version), which has sold more than 1.6 million copies. 
Billboard noted that Swift's TTPD now ranks third overall in terms of sales weeks in the modern era. Adele's 25 continues to reign supreme, having sold 3.378 million album unit equivalents in December 2015, while *NSYNC's No Strings Attached sold 2.4 million copies in April 2000. 
ET will continue to update as Swift's milestones roll in. 
Following the release of The Tortured Poets Department April 19, a source told ET that her NFL star boyfriend, Travis Kelce, "couldn't be more supportive and is pumped for Taylor."
"He knows how much this means to her and thinks she's extremely talented," the source said of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. "Taylor and Travis admire each other's creative processes and work ethic. They cheer each other on, respect each other's opinions, and are open and communicative."
It's no surprise that Kelce is a fan of Swift's work. In fact, the only two love songs on the release seem to be about her beau.
On "The Alchemy," Swift isn't exactly subtle as she tosses in plenty of football references as a nod to Kelce.
When Swift delighted fans with a 2 a.m. surprise in the form of a double album, Swifties were granted another apparent love song about the pro athlete titled "So High School." 
As for the album as a whole -- which is chock-full of heartbreak songs following Swift's splits with actor Joe Alwyn and musician Matty Healy -- the source told ET that Swift "is so excited" about the release.
"She has put her heart and soul into the music, just like with everything she does," the source said, "and can't wait for her fans to listen to it and to share it with them."
