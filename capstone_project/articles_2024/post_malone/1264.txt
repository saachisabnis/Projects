LAS VEGAS, NV. (WIBW) - Usher will be taking the stage for the much anticipated Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show, while Reba McEntire, Post Malone, and Andra Day perform the pregame songs.
Those three will be joined by three deaf artists selected to sign the respective songs in ASL, and a light was shed on them at the start of the Apple Music Halftime Show press conference in Las Vegas on Thursday.
“I am so so excited. Not just to sign America the Beautiful with Post Malone, but to be on one of the most famous platforms in the world at the Super Bowl,” said Anjel Pinero, who will sign America the Beautiful along to Post Malone’s voice. “So just to share my art, I know that my hands with his voice together are just gonna be amazing. I can’t wait to share that with everybody.”
Coda star Daniel Durant will sign the National Anthem, sung by Reba McEntire.
“The history there, how we became independent, how we are serving the country, it’s just an amazing song,” Durant said. “And I will say as I started to rehearse, I just had goosebumps. I cannot wait to just make it happen on Sunday.”
Then Shaheem Sanchez will sign Lift Every Voice and Sing alongside Andra Day.
“Just trying to figure out the meaning of the song, how to make that connection with the song,” Sanchez said. “Obviously I’m deaf and I’ve never heard that song before. So I started learning about the song. Learning the meaning behind it, memorizing it, and how different it is, just feeling the vibe. But never give up right? There’s no excuses, just keep on rehearsing.”
The Big Game kicks off at 5:30 on Sunday, but be sure to tune in early only on WIBW if you want to see those pregame performances.
