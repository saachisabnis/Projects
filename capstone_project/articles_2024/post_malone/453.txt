Chrisean Rock, a familiar name in the entertainment scene due to her connections with rapper Blueface and appearances on reality television, finds herself embroiled in legal trouble. James Wright Chanel, a backup singer for renowned artist Tamar Braxton, has filed a lawsuit against Rock, alleging assault stemming from an altercation at a concert last November.
According to reports from RadarOnline, the lawsuit was personally served to Rock while she was attending a local high school football game. The process server managed to locate her based on a social media post where she disclosed her whereabouts at Cathedral High School in Los Angeles.
Chanel’s accusations detail a disturbing incident backstage at Braxton’s concert, where Rock, also known as Chrisean Malone, allegedly physically assaulted him. The altercation purportedly erupted after Rock was denied the opportunity to perform her music at the event.
Despite the gravity of the allegations, Rock, who recently celebrated her first Mother’s Day, has yet to issue a public response. Instead, she has chosen to share intimate moments with her son on social media, offering glimpses into her personal life amid mounting legal challenges.
Meanwhile, Chanel’s attorney, Kevin Anderson, has underscored the seriousness of the situation, citing injuries sustained by Chanel during the altercation. According to Anderson, Chanel suffered two broken teeth and facial injuries as a result of Rock’s actions.
In a candid interview on The Jst Us Podcast back in March, Chanel opened up about the emotional toll of the incident, describing it as traumatic. He expressed bewilderment and anguish over the assault, revealing that it had left him grappling with intense emotions and insomnia.
While Rock’s personal milestones, including her journey into motherhood, have garnered attention, the lawsuit casts a shadow over her recent celebrations. As the legal proceedings unfold, industry insiders and fans alike await further developments in this ongoing saga, eager for clarity and resolution.
