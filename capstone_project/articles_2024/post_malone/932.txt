Jason Aldean is one country superstar who has never shied away from controversy. He has always openly expressed his political views at his concerts and on social media. That fact has got him in hot water a time or two with fans and even fellow country stars.
So, it's no surprise that when asked in a recent interview about social media, he expressed he wasn't a fan. Jason said, "Social media, across the board, get rid of it. That's going to be a very unpopular answer."
He added, "It's just, to me, it's done … you see people, they can't get out of their phones now, and they're so oblivious to what's going on in the outside world. It drives me crazy."
Aldean concluded that when "used in the right way," he thinks social media can be great. He does believe that people take "advantage of stuff" and they turn it into something that it wasn't intended to be.

Aldean is the latest country star to talk about Post Malone getting into the country genre. Post Malone is doing a country album full of collaborations with Morgan Wallen, Blake Shelton, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Combs.
Jason said in a recent interview about Malone having a hit with Morgan Wallen, "You can tell when something's real. With him, we can see it's an influence. Country fans don't accept everyone, but with him, they have. You can't fool them. They know what's authentic."
The country star's "Highway Desperado Tour," which kicked off in May, will wrap up in his hometown of Macon, Georgia, in October. He said that "typically we play Atlanta," but this year, Atlanta's not on the schedule. In Macon, they have a new amphitheater that he wants to "try it out." He also likes the fact that he has a lot of family in Macon that they can see while there.
