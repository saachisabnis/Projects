Jan Ravnik captured the hearts of Swifties when he stepped on stage with Taylor Swift for her Eras Tour.
Ravnik was one of 16 dancers to take the stage with Swift that first night in Glendale, Arizona, and the performer took to social media to share his appreciation for the pop star — and the opportunity.
“I’m beyond grateful to be part of @taylorswift Eras Tour 🙏🏼❤️ Still can’t put into words how I feel after yesterdays opening night!” he wrote via Instagram in March 2023 alongside photos from his first show. “I never thought that small town boy from Slovenia could come so far, but here we are 🙋🏻‍♂️🥹.”
Since then, he’s become a staple of the show, and Swifties have continued to be impressed with Ravnik’s talent and charismatic stage presence. Ravnik grew even more popular as he caught fans’ eyes in the Eras Tour movie, which hit theaters in October 2023.
When the Eras Tour kicked off for its European leg in Paris in May, Ravnik was featured in a new dance duet with Swift for “Fortnight,” much to fans’ delight.
“Jan stepping in for Post Malone during the ‘Fortnight’ set!” one user gushed via X. “It was all simply so incredible 😍🤍.”
