Celebrities, they’re just like Us — and by that we mean they’re absolutely flipping out over Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album, which dropped on Friday, March 29.
Hailey Bieber, Rita Ora and more celebs took to social media to celebrate the release of the 42-year-old’s sprawling foray into country music. The album, which features 27 tracks, includes  songs with Post Malone and Miley Cyrus, along with speaking features from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Linda Martell.
Beyoncé dropped the album’s songs “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages” in February, becoming the first Black woman with a No. 1 single on Billboard‘s Hot Country Songs chart.
Here’s how celebrity fans are reacting to the singer’s new tracks:
“Whew 😤,” the Rhode founder wrote via Instagram alongside a screenshot of “Jolene,” which Beyoncé collaborated with Parton on.
Ora declared in an Instagram Story that she was “gaggin” while listening to Beyoncé and Cyrus’ collaboration, “II Most Wanted.” She followed up with another photo of the song “Ya Ya,” accompanied by the caption, “I’m gassssedddd, arghhhh, yessss @beyonce.”
“Ready for it @Beyonce #COWBOYCARTER,” Washington declared via X alongside an animated photo of Beyoncé in her cowboy getup.

“OBSESSED,” Kotb captioned a photo of Beyoncé’s song “Blackbird.” She also gave a shout-out to “Ya Ya” by posting a snapshot of the song alongside a big red arrow.
Cyrus celebrated the release of “II Most Wanted” by posting a sweet message to Beyoncé via X. “II Most Wanted is out now on the new @Beyonce album #CowboyCarter,” she wrote. “I’ve loved Beyonce since long before I had the opportunity to meet & work with her. My admiration runs so much deeper now that I’ve created along side of her.”
She added, “Thank you Beyonce. You’re everything & more. Love you. To everyone who spent time making this song so special thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

After sharing his appreciation for Beyoncé, Malone dedicated an Instagram post to declare his love for the singer. “i love you @beyonce,” he gushed.
The Real Housewives of New York City star channeled her inner cowboy by sharing a photo of herself via X riding a mechanical bull. “Friday mood #CowboyCarter,” she wrote alongside the snap.

The iconic artist, featured on the song “The Linda Martell Show,” reacted via Instagram. “I am proud that @beyonce is exploring her country music roots,” Martell shared. “What she is doing is beautiful, and I’m honored to be a part of it. It’s Beyoncé, after all!”
“Excellent,” the DJ commented on Beyoncé’s release day Instagram post.
“THIS is what music is. Limitless, no boundaries, no gatekeeping,” Pope gushed via social media. “It’s collaborative and inspiring. It’s tipping the hat to the ones who paved the way before you. It’s lifting up the voices who are forging a new path. Absolutely blown away by this record. And I’m THRILLED to see my pal @brittneyspencer get the moment she deserves. Thank you @beyonce for elevating country music in a way I’ve never seen before.”
“On repeat since midnight. Whew,” Bush wrote via Instagram Story. “I swoon for every second of this record. It’s magic. But what it really means isn’t mine to speak on. To understand the profundity of what Bey is doing, please read [Brittany Packnett Cunningham]’s reflections on #CowboyCarter #ActII.”
The young country pop artist is featured on “Blackbird” and “American Requiem,” marking her first collaboration and feature on another artist’s album.
“I always say Beyoncé raised me. Beyoncé taught me how to be soft but strong. A force of nature. I’ve watched her be forged like metal in the fire of this industry and she remained poised, and grateful,” Adell wrote via Instagram. “The last two years in Nashville I have kept my head down, counted all my blessings big and small, and tried to perfect this craft of my artistry. When I saw Renaissance last summer, I knew I was NOT working hard enough. I was reminded again watching the Renaissance documentary. I sat in that theatre bawling my eyes out and said out loud, I will work with Beyoncé in 2024. NO IDEA HOW I WAS GONNA DO THAT 😂 but I felt it in my bones. Go back through every interview I have done, I get asked a million times ‘who is your dream collab’ and I have answered the same every time. Beyoncé. Thank you Queen Bey for busting these gates wide open with this album. For letting your light spill over onto MY head. I am humbled by the thought.”
The former first lady took to Instagram to gush over Beyoncé’s accomplishments with her latest album.

“@Beyonce, you are a record-breaker and history-maker. With Cowboy Carter, you have changed the game once again by helping redefine a music genre and transform our culture. I am so proud of you!” Obama wrote. “Cowboy Carter is a reminder that despite everything we’ve been through to be heard, seen, and recognized, we can still dance, sing, and be who we are unapologetically. This album reminds us that we ALL have power. There’s power in our history, in our joy, and in our votes — and we can each use our own gifts and talents to make our voices heard on the issues that matter most to us.”
Obama also took the opportunity to remind her followers that their voices matter and to make sure they vote in the election this year.
“Together, we can stand up for what we believe in, and we must do that at the ballot box this year. The issues that impact us most are on the ballot across the country — from equal pay and racial justice to reproductive healthcare and climate change,” she shared. “And as Queen Bey says at the end of ‘Ya Ya,’ we need to ‘keep the faith’ and ‘VOTE!’”
