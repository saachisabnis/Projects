Luke Combs just put Post Malone on blast for wearing counterfeit "Combs" merchandise during one of his performances.
Of course, the country singer was feigning being upset when he shared a photo of Malone to his Instagram Stories. In fact, it sounds like he's more excited that his fellow collaborator would represent him at one of his own shows.
The shirt in question features a photo of Combs with what looks like his signature across it. The name "Combs" is written above the photo, with the song title "Beer Never Broke My Heart" below.
"Shirt is gas," Combs writes on social media (that's a good thing). "Even though it's bootleg haha."
Per Urban Dictionary, "gas" means "good a-- s--t."
In 2023, Combs' legal team sued one of his fans for selling bootleg merchandise. Nicol Harness was slapped with a $250,000 lawsuit for her Combs-themed tumblers that she designed. Harness says she made a total of $380.
According to News Channel 8 in Tampa, she was one of several defendants in a larger lawsuit regarding counterfeit merchandice. A judge ruled that Harness must pay the "Ain't No Love in Oklahoma" singer $250K.
Once Combs learned of the lawsuit, he went to work to have it dropped. He said he contracts a company to prohibit large corporations from taking advantage of his name and likeness, but felt terrible that someone like Harness had become a target.
"I'm so apologetic, talking to her. It makes me sick, honestly, that this would happen, especially at the holidays," he shared on social media at the time. "I can't imagine being in her shoes."
