It’s only been 13 months since Godsmack last played in these parts — at Pine Knob Music Theatre, as it will be doing again this weekend.
But drummer Shannon Larkin promises it won’t be an exact repeat of what the heavy rock quartet did then.
“We have a grandiose idea that we hope everyone’s gonna love, and we hope we can perform it flawlessly for y’all,” says Larkin, 57, who joined in 2002 and has been with the group for its last six albums — as well as the 2012 concert album “Live & Inspired,” which was recorded at Detroit’s Fox Theatre. “We’re gonna do songs from every record in a cool way that kind of ties together, video-wise, through the whole show.
“It’s gonna be a kick-ass Godsmack, heavy-ass set, and I’m excited for it.”
Last year’s Godsmack show was part of a tour promoting the band’s then-new eighth studio album, “Lighting Up the Sky.” At the time, the band members said it would be their last full album release, though they said Godsmack would continue to tour and, essentially, rest on the laurels of a catalog that’s produced 29 Top 10 Billboard Mainstream Rock chart hits since 1998, including 13 No. 1 singles.
Now, however, Larkin says the band is no longer ruling out the possibility of some new music.
“We’re not gonna make new (albums), but that doesn’t mean we can’t put out a new single, or if a cool song comes along, we’ll go in the studio and record it,” the drummer explains. “Last year, when we said, ‘We’re not gonna make any more records,’ it kinda blew up and everyone was all like, ‘Why are you gonna quit making records?’ and whatever. It was a bigger deal than we thought.
“We want to keep playing, and usually when you tour, it comes with an album. That won’t be the case anymore, but a new song every now and then … sure, why not? I think people would like that and so would we.”
Godsmack, Seether, Asking Alexandria, Wage War, Sleep Theory, Flat Black, Royale Lynn and Fame on Fire perform at RIFF Fest 2024, starting at 2 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28 at Pine Knob Music Theatre, 33 Bob Seger Drive, Independence Township. 313-471-7000 or 313Presents.com.
