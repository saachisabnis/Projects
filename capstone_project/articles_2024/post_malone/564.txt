Jelly Roll, MGK and the writers behind the lyrics to "Lonely Road" didn't just twist the message of John Denver's classic "Take Me Home, Country Roads."
They built an entirely new story.
Melodically, country fans will hear the 1971 hit with each chorus, but the verses and bridge to "Lonely Road" find the two crossover singers going deep into longing and sorrow.
The result is a mid-tempo heartbreaker as effective as Denver's celebration of West Virginia.

The "Lonely Road" lyrics focus on the storyteller. MGK goes first, describing an attempt to rebound after the failure of a relationship. He refers to his ex as a devil, but also admits, "I'll wait for you."
Jelly Roll's verse also relies on on the torment of love gone wrong. "I use alcohol just to fill that hole / Will our home ever be the same," he sings.
Country fans know these new lyrics are on brand for Jelly Roll, who often puts his struggles with addiction at the front of his records. MGK also battled substance abuse, admitting he was able to get sober in 2022.
As "Lonely Road" continues, the lyrics are delivered with less anger and more remorse, tinged with hope.
"Cause even a palace ain't home without you / So I might leave here soon, but I wanna leave you this song," the two men sing.
The music video for the song stars both men and their real life wives (Bunnie Xo and Megan Fox), plus MGK and Fox's baby.
MGK:Lonely road / Take me home / Take me home / Lonely road.
I'ma go downtown / Ain't been in a long time / I'm taking back Sundays / Since you took away my life / There's some things that I know now / Couple songs that I'd rewrite / Start over like Mondays / Pouring strong on a weeknight.
Pre-Chorus:See, I hear the devil wears Prada, but I couldn't read the tags / And your horns started showing when I seen you mad / But I'll wait for you / 'Cause this is not the face I knew / I probably could've saved us, but instead, I let us crash / 'Cause I don't trust no one to love me back / But she say I do / And this is not the place for you.
Lonely road take me home / To the place where we went wrong / Where'd you go now / It's been a ghost town / And I'm still here / All alone.
Jelly Roll:When the days feel long / And the nights get cold / And I'm thousands of miles away / I use alcohol just to fill that hole / Will our home ever be the same.
Repeat Pre-Chorus
Repeat Chorus
And if you could salvage my soul / Would you sacrifice this life to not die alone / 'Cause even a palace ain't home without you / So I might leave here soon, but I wanna leave you this song.
Repeat Chorus
This lonely road / Yeah, I'm on this road now / This lonely road / Feeling so alone / Take me home / This lonely road / I'm on this road now / This lonely road / Feeling so alone / Take me home.
