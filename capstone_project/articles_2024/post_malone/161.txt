Reba McEntire shirked the glam for a more relaxed look once she got on stage to host the 2024 Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards. The singer wore a pair of red cowboy boots for the event, a change from what she had worn on the red carpet.
As to be expected, cowboy boots were a major move for the awards show. Talent like Anne Wilson, Reyna Roberts, Hunter Girl and Queen Noveen all walked the carpet wearing cowboy boots. Of them, Noveen’s featured similar to the 17-time host.
Hosted by McEntire, the Academy of Country Music award show honors the genre’s artists and respective accomplishments from the previous year. The ceremony is typically held in April or May, and includes performances and appearances from country music icons, as well as genre-bending musicians.

First starting in 1966 and now operating through Dick Clark Productions, this year’s ceremony features appearances from the likes of Jason Aldean, Kane Brown, Jelly Roll and more. The 2024 show was streamed live on Prime Video and featured performances from Kane Brown, Miranda Lambert, Post Malone, Chris Stapleton and more.
McEntire’s boots were classic red cowboy boots. They featured a customary Western heel and pointed toe. The boots also had pull tabs on the sides and embroidery going up the shaft. 
They were only one of two pairs of boots she wore for the event. The second pair of cowboy boots also featured embroidery but were black. Those styles were knee-high. 
The “Fancy” singer is a major fan of boots. She reportedly has more than 85 pairs in custom storage. In 2017, McEntire launched a collaborative collection with Justin Boot Co. Those Western boots and cowgirl-inspired shoes are sill available for purchase. They include styles like the Susie, a leather sneaker, as well as the 20 inch Western boot dubbed the Shawna.
