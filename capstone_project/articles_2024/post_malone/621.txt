The cast of "The Bachelorette" is here. Season 21 features Jenn Tran as the show's first Asian American lead. Starting with the July 8 premiere, she is sifting through a group of 25 contestants to find love. 
But who are her men? The 2024 "Bachelorette" cast includes the brother of a Bachelor Nation alum, more than one entrepreneur and a "love virgin" — more on that later. The first impression rose went to Sam M., a general contractor from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina — but there are many weeks until the finale. 
Bachelor Nation fans first met Jenn on Joey Graziadei’s Season 28 of “The Bachelor." 
The Miami native, who is studying to be a physician assistant, became a fan-favorite as she opened up to Joey about her Vietnamese family. She connected with viewers who don’t often see themselves represented on television. A few fans previously spoke to TODAY.com about their hopes for the season and what it means to them to see Jenn’s love story unfold on television. 
On June 3, the franchise released the photos and bios of the contestants that Jenn will meet on night one at the show’s brand new mansion in Santa Susana, California. 
Tran is also making history as the first lead to kick off her season at the Hummingbird Nest Ranch. After the premiere, though, the cast left swiftly — the show whisked contestants away to Melbourne, Australia.
So, who could possibly be the love of her life? Get to know the 25 contestants, and where they stand each week, below. We'll be updating this article weekly to reflect changes in the cast as Jenn goes after her connection.
