Beyoncé has launched her own whisky brand in collaboration with Moët Hennessy – and it has deep ties to her family history.
Named SirDavis, the new line pays homage to the superstar’s paternal great-grandfather Davis Hogue, who she recently learned was a farmer and a moonshiner in the American South during Prohibition.

“I’ve always been drawn to the power and confidence I feel when drinking quality whisky and wanted to invite more people to experience that feeling,” Bey said in a statement. “When I discovered that my great-grandfather had been a moonshine man, it felt like my love for whisky was fated. SirDavis is a way for me to pay homage to him, uniting us through a new shared legacy.
“In partnering with Moët Hennessy, we have crafted a delicious American whisky that respects tradition but also empowers people to experience something new and unique in the category. You can taste it better than I could ever tell you — welcome, SirDavis.”

And as a nod to her roots, SirDavis is fully finished, blended, bottled and headquartered in Beyoncé’s Houston hometown – making for Moët Hennessy’s first spirits brand developed entirely in the United States.
Each bottle has a price point of $89 and will be released nationally in September.
