Kim Zolciak's estranged husband Kroy Biermann is denying claims made by the reality star that he stole 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' in jewelry and apparel from her.
Marlys A. Bergstrom, a lawyer representing the former Atlanta Falcons player, told TMZ Tuesday afternoon that the allegations brought by the Real Housewives Of Atlanta alum, 45, are 'not true.'
The attorney for Biermann, 38, spoke out amid reports surfacing Tuesday displaying police bodycam footage after Zolciak filed a report with authorities in Georgia at the Alpharetta Police Department earlier this month accusing Biermann of the theft.
The Don't Be Tardy star was accompanied by an unidentified female friend in the video, in which she said that she initially figured out the items in question were missing in May of 2023.
'I've asked for them back and he won't give them back,' Zolciak said in the clip, explaining to authorities that Biermann kept the items in a safe located in the master bedroom of their home.

A source close to the situation on Tuesday told Page Six that the items remain unaccounted for.
Zolciak told authorities that last October, she contacted police to their home in hopes of him giving back the items.
In bodycam footage from that incident, Zolciak told police that Biermann had past 'threatened' her and 'been physical' with her. 
Biermann told police offers in the incident that he 'didn't do anything' and felt his safety was jeopardized while on the premises.
Police subsequently mediated the contentious exchange and oversaw as Biermann have Zolciak various medications, neck cream, her phone charger and a comforter.
In the police bodycam footage released Friday, Zolciak told authorities that specific items including a watch, purses and diamond jewelry were no longer being stored in the safe, which she was able to gain access to.
When she did, Zolciak said she discovered that 'everything is gone.'
Zolciak told police, 'My attorney said I need to file a police report because the stuff is stolen.'

Zolciak and Biermann have dealt with ongoing strife amid massive financial problems 
Amid their split, they have dealt with ongoing strife amid massive financial problems; and have been seeking to sell the seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom Milton, Georgia mansion 
Zolciak told police she was caught off-guard after 'the jeweler, some lady, sent [her] pics on Instagram and said, "I love your bracelets. I'm so thankful."'
Biermann made an estimated $25,000 off the sale of those items, Zolciak told authorities.
Police told Zolciak that the issue at hand was complicated by the fact that her divorce from Biermann had not been finalized.
The officer told Zolciak, 'Yours becomes his and his becomes yours. Until that divorce has been finalized, there is no technical crime that is being committed right now.'
Zolciak and Biermann's divorce 'is nowhere near being finalized,' an insider told Page Six on Tuesday.
Zolciak and Biermann are parents to four kids - Kroy Jr., 12, Kash, 11, and twins Kane and Kaia, 10.
Biermann had adopted Zolciak's older children from previous relationships - Brielle, 26, and Ariana Biermann, 22 - when they were minors in the couple's earlier years.
Amid their split, they have dealt with ongoing strife amid massive financial problems; and have been seeking to sell the seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom Milton, Georgia mansion, recently reducing their asking price on multiple occasions amid time constraints.

The pair initially filed for divorce from one another in May, but reconciled in July
The estranged celeb couple made headlines in December after a November 20 fight outside of the home was caught on police camera that went public.
In the altercation - in which police said one of their four young kids called 911 - Biermann called Zolciak a 'narcissist;' claimed she had been 'f***ing other men;' and said he was frustrated by 'her inability to f***ing solve problems, or address them, or do anything.'
He told responding police officers that their lives were 'destroyed' amid the pileup of problems and relationship ups-and-downs.
'There's no money!' Biermann said. 'There's no house! We're getting divorced one day, we're not the next! She's f***ing other men! What do you want?'
In surveillance footage, Zolciak sat in a Range Rover weeping as she told officers Biermann had been 'screaming at [her] for, like, two hours like a crazy person,' adding, 'I just said I wanted to get a divorce, I just wanted it to be over.'
She told police: 'I mentally and physically and emotionally can not take this any longer.'
Biermann and Zolciak's ongoing inability to get along also made headlines in October, when a judge in their ongoing split ordered Zolciak to reside in the basement of the home she and Zolciak share, TMZ reported after reviewing court docs.
Biermann - who in November was ordered to turn over his BMW amid missed payments for more than a year -  was ordered to stay in the primary bedroom of the abode, the judge said adding that 'neither party shall enter the other party’s individually awarded space in the marital residence without permission.'

Both parties are permitted to venture into the home's common areas, including the living room and kitchen. 
The mansion, which was built in 2008, is situated on a golf course and has a number of amenities, including a pool in the backyard, a gym, a movie theater, a bar, a wine cellar and arcade.
Zolciak gave fans a glimpse at the home on her Bravo spinoff Don't Be Tardy, showing off the interior of the luxe abode. She said at the time: 'I absolutely love our new home - Kroy and I are the king and queen of this f***ing house, so this is perfect for us.'
The brick and stone home, which is set adjacent to The Manor golf course, is gated and includes a motor court ahead of the entrance to the home, according to a Zillow listing.
The home's entrance leads to a two-story entry foyer with a curved staircase and open gallery, with an adjacent dining room and study with a designer chandelier and custom fireplace.
The kitchen of the home, according to the listing, has a large island, countertops, custom cabinets and Sub-Zero/Wolf appliances. A family room on the home's main level has a cathedral ceiling with ample seating, a fireplace and a crystal chandelier.
A full-size bar features floor-to-ceiling woodwork with a wine refrigerator, ice maker, dishwasher, and drink cooler.
The main suite in the home is centered around a sitting room and fireplace, along with a bathtub and shower, and walk-in closet. In the backyard of the abode, a covered veranda overlooks the heated pool and spa, along with an in-ground trampoline.

In the legal documents Biermann filed in September, the former Atlanta Falcons player requested the court allow him to move forward in putting the family's Milton, Georgia mansion on the market, stating it was on the brink of foreclosure.  
Biermann and Zolciak have been hindered by major financial and relationship problems in recent months, having initially split in May before calling off their divorce in July. 
They have reconciled and split up since then multiple times amid their ongoing family financial crisis, as Biermann in May called Zolciak a 'compulsive behavior addict' who had squandered $1.5 million dollars of the family fortune gambling.
The NFL alum made the allegations against Zolciak after she called police May 4 at their Milton, Georgia mansion, prior to his first divorce filing.
The accusations about Zolciak's gambling losses were seen in a Milton Police Department bodycam video after officers responded to the home after Kim reported a domestic dispute.
The footage was obtained by RadarOnline.com after Biermann and Zolciak filed for divorce from one another amid a 12-year marriage.   
Biermann - who was cautious as he spoke to law enforcement in hopes Zolciak would not hear him- called the Bravo personality a 'narcissist to the extreme level.'
Biermann said that Zolciak's penchant for gambling had grown exponentially in recent years.

'It's probably been going on for pretty much our entire marriage and it's gotten significantly worse,' Biermann said of Zolciak, who was pictured at a Bitcoin ATM in June in Atlanta. 'In the last two years, she's gambled away $700,000 - just in the last two-and-a-half years.'
He added: 'The total in the marriage was about $1.5 million dollars - and she does it online.'
In the incident, Zolciak told police that Biermann had locked in a safe a cache of valuable items she owned that were worth $175,000 - including designer purses and jewelry - and hid the key from her. 
Biermann said he believed the lot of items fell under the classification of community property, adding of the items: 'The problem is these are the assets, there are no [other] assets to go to.'
Biermann told police that the Don't Be Tardy alum 'has decimated everything' with her penchant for gambling; he added that some of her gaming activity was illegal.
Brielle has also been dogged by financial issues as of late, as she was sued by American Express over an unpaid balance. 
Zolciak sold off some of daughter Brielle Biermann's designer goods in July to drum up funds, with asking prices up to $20,000 for the high-ticket items. 
In their first two months of being split - in which both asked the court for sole legal and physical custody of their four younger children - Zolciak and Biermann took issue with one another in court documents.

Zolciak said that Biermann smokes marijuana, calling into credibility his ability to raise their kids; while Biermann claimed that Zolciak's gambling habit has consumed her time and decimated the family finances.
Biermann told officers they had continued to sleep in the same bed but did not engage with one another.
News broke in July that the reality TV pair had decided not to split, withdrawing their divorce papers in Superior Court of Fulton County in Georgia. 
They were seen shortly before attending a church together in Atlanta.
Zolciak rose to fame as a member of the cast of Bravo's The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and parlayed her popularity into the spinoff Don't Be Tardy... on Bravo. She also competed on five episodes of Dancing with the Stars in 2015.
Biermann was drafted into the NFL in 2008 after attending Montana, and played eight seasons, all for the Falcons.
He had his most productive year on the field in 2012 when he started 14 games, racking up 36 tackles, three sacks and scoring a touchdown on an interception.
The pair exchanged vows in a lavish $1 million wedding on November 11, 2011 - marking the date 11/11/11 - at their Georgia mansion.
