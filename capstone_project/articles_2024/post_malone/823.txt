NFL teams are in training camp getting ready for the start of the season and one NFL team is adding some country music flair to their season prep.
The Cleveland Browns are hosting part of their training camp on the road in West Virginia at the Greenbriar Resort. It was during a break some of the players had their shot to impress not with football pads, but with their voices.
"Take Me Home, Country Roads" originally released by John Denver in 1971, has since become an anthem for the teams of the University of West Virginia, and even became the official state song in 2014. But, as a sing-along country song, it may be unmatched. See which players were able to sing and those who didn't have any interest in playing along.
One of the most impressive singers shouldn't be a stranger to Taste of Country readers as Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah has shown off his ability to sing country music before when he belted out some Eric Church at a golf outing for the team.
His skills didn't go unnoticed on social media, even a "miserable Cleveland Fan" enjoyed it.
The Cleveland Browns won't be in West Virginia too long as they return to Cleveland for the rest of camp starting Aug. 4. The NFL season itself doesn't get started until Thursday, Sept. 5 when the Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl Champions, will host the Baltimore Ravens.
Wood is host of the 'Taste of Country Mornings with Wood and Nicole' that can be heard every morning from 6-10am CST on the 'Taste of Country' app, on local affiliates where available and online at tasteofcountry.com.
