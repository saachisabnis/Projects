Post Malone continues to make his rounds in country music, this time teaming up with Blake Shelton for a new Friday night, let loose kind of track. Malone shared a 27-second snippet of the new track, which Shelton re-shared bopping along and raising a drink to their work.
Like many country songs, the pair's collaboration is about cutting loose on a Friday night after a long work week. The narrator has earned the right to tie one on in the everyman track.
"Somebody pour me a drink / Somebody bum me a smoke / I'm about to get on a buzz / I'm about to get on a roll / I've been breaking my back / Just keeping up with the Joneses / Y'all know what I mean / Y'all know how it goes" the two sing, trading lines.
While Post Malone has confirmed he is working on a country-focused project, he has yet to reveal further details such as a title, tracklist or release date. It's more than likely this new collaboration will be on the album though.
His collaboration with Shelton is not his first joint country effort. The rapper has already dropped "I Had Some Help" featuring Morgan Wallen and it's popularity is already positioning it to be the song of the summer this year.
Both singers are featured in the music video for "I Had Some Help" — which might have revealed the title of Malone's country collection. The truck featured in the video has a license plate that reads CTYCWBY — in other words, City Cowboy. Sounds like a good album title, right? Only time will tell.
