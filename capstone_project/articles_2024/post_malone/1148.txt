Shaboozey expressed his gratitude for Beyoncé and hailed COWBOY CARTER “one of the most innovative country albums of all time,” after receiving his two nominations at the 58th CMA Awards. Beyoncé and her historic country record, however, did not appear on the list of nominees revealed on Monday morning (September 9).
Beyoncé featured several artists on COWBOY CARTER tracks, including highly-respected country legends and rising artists. Shaboozey is one of the artists to appear on Beyoncé’s album, along with Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts, Linda Martell, Willie Jones, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, who received a few nods for his own country music he released this year. Beyoncé was one of several major artists whose name did not appear on the list of nominations announced by the Country Music Association on Monday.
“That goes without saying. Thank you [Beyoncé] for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time!” Shaboozey wrote on his Instagram story set to Beyoncé’s “16 Carriages.” He shared COWBOY CARTER’s album artwork that he posted when the album arrived in March. Shaboozey said at that time that he’s “honored to be in the company of two historically significant black voices,” referring to Beyoncé and Martell. “Thank you for always being the one to step up and kick in a door when others are afraid to. Texas born & raised, worked hard for yours. You are country. Put her in the Grand Ol’ Opry NOW! Love you!🖤🤠🐐”
Shaboozey is nominated in the New Artist of the Year category and the Single of the Year category for “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” The Country Music Association will announce additional information — including performers, hosts and presenters — at a later date. See the full list of nominees here.
The 58th CMA Awards will take place at Bridgestone Arena in Downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The show is set for Wednesday, November 20. It will air live at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT on ABC, and will be available the following day on Hulu.
