	It’s only October, but ’tis the season for Bunnie XO.

	The Dumb Blonde podcast host took to TikTok this week to share a hilarious throwback video in which she FaceTimes her husband, country star Jelly Roll, to hear his thoughts on starting up the Christmas season at home. “I was wondering if you think it’s too early to get a Christmas tree,” she asks Jelly, who immediately replies, “It’s not even Halloween!”

	“Yes, it’s too early,” the “Need a Favor” singer continued, to which Bunnie playfully responds, “OK, I’m going to get one tomorrow. Love you!”

	Jelly Roll has a lot more than Halloween and Christmas to celebrate as 2024 comes to a close. The superstar notched his first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart with Beautifully Broken this month. The project also achieved the third-largest week, by units, for any country album in 2024 with 161,000 equivalent album units, following the debuts of Beyoncé and Post Malone’s country sets. The album also opens at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart.

	To celebrate, Bunnie shared her reaction to the chart news. “You guys!” she wrote on Instagram Stories, adding a sobbing emoji. “We did it!!!!!!”

	The Grammy-nominated superstar has also revealed that his fitness routine led to a 100-pound weight loss. In a video update on Instagram earlier this month, Jelly’s nutrition coach Ian Larios explained that in addition to a healthy diet, he’s been “walking the arenas, playing basketball, boxing.”
