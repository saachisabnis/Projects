This is just another reason why Austin Richard Post (Post Malone) has a reputation for being such a kind human.
If you went to his F-1 Trillion Tour concert on Monday in Bangor at Maine Savings Amphitheater, then you witnessed this man stop in the middle of one of his most iconic songs "White Iverson" to check on a fan that looked like they may need assistance.
If you're a regular concert go-er, then you probably know if you're in the pit you're most likely batting up against mosh-pits, dehydration, and flying bows left and right. This is where the person was when Posty miraculously spotted them mid-song.
I've never witnessed anything like it.
I was up in the suite at this point, so I didn't quite get the full visual, but up on the big screens, I watched it all go down.
From what I heard, it seemed like a fan was visually a bit dehydrated or possibly pre-gamed a bit too hard and needed to exit the pit immediately for some water.
Whatever the reason, Posty told his band to cut the music immediately and allow this fan to walk towards the front of the pit and sit on the side to drink some water. Later on in the show about half way through, before he performed "Congratulations" he stopped again and asked the crowd "is everyone okay?"
HeÂ wouldn't pick up the mic again until he heard the entire venue scream, "Yes."
Overall, Austin Richard Post is the goat. I think Maine would agree after that performance.
