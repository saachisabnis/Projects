The Global Citizen Festival officially announced Post Malone, Doja Cat, Jelly Roll, and Rauw Alejandro as headliners for the annual event that will take place this fall in New York City. 
The Global Citizen Festival is set for September 28th on Central Park’s Great Lawn. The festival announced its headliners on Tuesday (June 18) and noted that festivalgoers can expect more performers to be announced in the next few weeks. 
"It's been a few years since I was last on the Global Citizen Festival stage in Paris, and I'm excited to join forces with Global Citizen once again in Central Park this September to drive as much action as we can to make the world a better place," Doja Cat said in a statement to Global Citizen. "We all have a part we can play to help end extreme poverty and stand up for equity. I'm looking forward to being part of this major evening of positive change."
Global Citizen, the world’s leading international advocacy organization on a mission to end extreme poverty, hosts its annual festival to unite and take aim at major issues perpetuating extreme poverty around the world. 
The event will be hosted by Global Citizen Ambassador Hugh Jackman, with special appearances by Dr. Jane Goodall, DBE, Founder of the Jane Goodall Institute & UN Messenger of Peace, and Global Citizen Festival Curator, Chris Martin of Coldplay. 
"For over a decade, Global Citizen has driven life-saving impact for nearly 1.3 billion people around the world, and we'll gather once again on September 28 to help end extreme poverty, defend the planet, and demand equity," Hugh Jackman stated.
iHeartRadio is once again teaming up with Global Citizen to help promote its mission and air the festival on stations across the country as well as in the free iHeartRadio app.
