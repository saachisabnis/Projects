Swae Lee will headline Penn State’s Student Program Association and Movin’ On’s “LightsUP” festival on Friday, August 30. The concert, which has yet to set an opening act, will take place on the HUB lawn.
Lee, an R&B and hip-hop artist from Inglewood, California, kicked off his career in 2013, releasing various multi-platinum singles as one-half of the hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd. The duo released hits like “This Could Be Us,” “Black Beatles,” and “Come Get Her.”
Lee’s solo work includes a “Sunflower” with Post Malone and “Unforgettable” with French Montana being Diamond Certified. Additionally, Swae Lee has writing credits on Beyonce’s “Formation,” Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode,” and the aforementioned, “Sunflower” & “Unforgettable.”
In addition to Lee, LightsUP will include student performers Swervo Staacks, Jaaye, and MB3 Brown. Performers and other activities are expected to run from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. before Lee and the expected openers’ shows.
