	Written by Jessie Jo Dillon, Josh Miller, Daniel Ross and Chris Tompkins, and produced by Joey Moi, “Lies Lies Lies” was originally recorded by Wallen at London’s iconic Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios, per a press release. The song details the feeling of lying about moving on from a lost love despite holding on.

	It’s been an exciting year for Wallen, whose Post Malone collaboration, “I Had Some Help,” rebounds from No. 2 for a sixth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart.

	“I Had Some Help” also hits No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart, becoming a rare title that has topped the all-format airplay tally as well as the Country Airplay survey.

	He also opened a bar in Nashville, Tenn., earlier this summer. Wallen announced the bar’s opening on May 4 at one of his three sold-out Nissan Stadium shows in Nashville, though never specified the exact date. “It’s over off 4th Ave. just beside the Ryman [Auditorium], and it’s going to be opening Memorial Day weekend, so I hope I see y’all there,” Wallen said from the stage. 

	He’s set to headline BST Hyde Park in London on July 4, and plans on selling exclusive merch at the event. A portion of every ticket purchased to his live shows benefits The Morgan Wallen Foundation, which “operates on the core belief that all children deserve a chance to thrive, play, and create through sports and music.” To further celebrate his Hyde Park debut, MWF has earmarked $20,000 to support London Youth Choirs (LYC). LYC’s mission is to improve access to singing and music for disadvantaged young people.
