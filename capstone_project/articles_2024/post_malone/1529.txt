Taylor Swift continues to dominate in the week following the release of her 11th album, “The Tortured Poets Department.” The 31-track album has hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, tying Swift with Jay-Z for second-most No. 1 albums at 14. Only The Beatles, with 19 No. 1 albums, have had more.
The double album has amassed 2.61 million equivalent album units, according to Luminate, the industry data and analytics company. A shocking 1.91 million of those units come from traditional album sales — people purchasing downloads, CDs, cassettes and vinyl. Vinyl accounts for 859,000 units sold, the highest number of vinyl sales in modern history.

By Monday afternoon, Swift had broken yet another record with tracks claiming the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100. Previously, she was the only artist to ever monopolize the top 10 when her last album, 2022's “Midnights” took over the charts.
So what's in the No. 1 spot this time around? Her lead single, “Fortnight” featuring Post Malone, followed by “Down Bad,” “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart," “The Tortured Poets Department," and “So Long, London,” respectively.
