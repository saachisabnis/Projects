We Texans are well known for our warm hospitality and friendly nature. So it should be no surprise that many visitors take well to the welcoming atmosphere they find here.
Honestly, why would a live music lover want to live anywhere but in the "Live Music Capital of the World," Austin? Our entire state is known for its thriving music scene. We have produced hundreds of legendary musicians from all genres i.e. Beyoncé, Post Malone, Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly, Koe Wetzel, Selena, and that list goes on and on.
