THE FAIR â€” The Paris Olympics starts in just one week. Top swimmers from around the world will compete to see who is the fastest. This, however, is not about one of those swimmers.
This little pig seems like many of us â€” a little afraid to jump in the water. And isn't that one of life's great achievements, to overcome fear and make the big leap?
Standing at the precipice of the pool, this gutsy piglet is ready.

With a little leap into the vast tank of water, the pig shows anyone can dive into danger, move forward and conquer.
Truly inspiring.
