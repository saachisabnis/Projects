Crocs/Pringles
I can’t help but respect the folks at Crocs for managing to carve out a very solid niche for the company’s footwear, which now includes a pair of limited-edition boots featuring holsters designed with Pringles cans in mind.
It’s been more than two decades since Crocs set up shop in Colorado to start pumping out the signature foam clogs that managed to cultivate a cult following among customers who were willing to overlook their objectively hideous design thanks to the comfort they provided.
Since then, Crocs has transformed into an international empire with a market cap exceeding $7 billion and has collaborated with notable names like Justin Bieber and Post Malone as well as a number of brands that have used partnershipsc to let their creative flag fly—like KFC, which dreamed up some accessories that smelled like fried chicken.
Now, Crocs has returned with a vengeance with the help of Pringles, which is the latest corporate partner to capitalize on that sweet, sweet synergy in the form of a collab featuring four different pairs of Crocs as well as a pack of the “Jibbitz” that fans of the clogs use to customize their kicks.
That lineup included what was officially dubbed the Pringles x Crocs Classic Crush Boot, which features a heel inspired by a small pile of the potato chips as well as holsters that can fit a miniature can of the stackable snacks.
Now, I can’t say I’d personally shell out $100 to add those to my collection, but there are apparently plenty of people who were more than happy to do exactly that when you consider the boots sold out shortly after the collection went on sale at noon on Tuesday.
It didn’t take long for them to pop up on eBay, where the cheapest pair is currently being offered for $179.99 while the most expensive will set you back close to $300.
Capitalism never fails to deliver.
