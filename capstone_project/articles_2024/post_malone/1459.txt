The Beyoncé effect strikes again. According to CBS News, the singer’s track with Post Malone, “Levii’s Jeans,” helped the company boost its stock by nearly 20%.
The track appears on the singer’s eighth studio album, Act II: Cowboy Carter. The country-infused project, released on March 29, is the second installment of her Renaissance series and pays homage to the singer’s southern roots.
“Denim is having a moment, and the Levi’s brand is having a powerful moment around the world,” Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement. She continued: “One of the things that really is significant about Levi’s brand, and we place a lot of emphasis and investment, is making sure that Levi’s brand remains in the center of culture.”
Glass added, “And I don’t think there’s any better evidence or proof point than having someone like Beyoncé, who is a culture shaper, to actually name a song after us.” Capitalizing on the moment, the company has changed its account name on Instagram to “Levii’s” to reflect the spelling of the title of her new song.
