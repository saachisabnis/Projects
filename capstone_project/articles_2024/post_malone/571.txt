Jonny Darko is the alias of Jonathan Fuller, a musician and producer from Minneapolis Minnesota. Jonny released his first album at the age of 15 and has been producing ever since. His sound is self described as "the love child of Frank Ocean, Post Malone and Bon Iver." Blending broken down samples of instruments and voices with energetic drums, fuzzy synth's and lush vocal performances, Jonny Darko creates unique soundscapes that strike a chord between bedroom pop and lo-fi trap music.
