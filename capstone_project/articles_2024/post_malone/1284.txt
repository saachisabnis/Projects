Taylor Swift's fans ‚Äì "Swifties" as they call themselves ‚Äì have been sent into a frenzy yet again over new Easter eggs they noticed during the pop star's Eras Tour stop in Milan, Italy.
During her Saturday, July 13 show, Swift wore a new dress for her Tortured Poets Department set, which had fans discussing possible hidden meanings. While the dress remained pretty similar to the other dress the 34-year-old had been wearing, this one had one small, yet notable difference ‚Äì new lyrics on the skirt.
While lines from "Fortnight" (which features Post Malone and is also the lead single from TTPD) usually wrapped around the songstress's outfit, the latest version showcased lyrics from "Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me?" prompting speculation among fans that this song might have something to do with her next single.
One fan on X (formerly known as Twitter) posted, "Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me as the second single confirmed?" while another hoped, "Lets go for Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me? The film ü§©." A third fan said, "maybe it's like the music video eras so we are getting a waolom video and the ilyirml dress will never return??"
Another theory circulating among fans is that Swift could be hinting at the release of Reputation (Taylor's Version). This speculation was fueled by her new dress for the Fearless set, which fans noted bore a resemblance to outfits from her Reputation stadium tour. One fan compared the colors, posting, "Those are the colors for rep tour if im not wrong..." Another excited fan said, "REPUTATION TV COMING BE READY EVERYONE," while a third agreed, "WHATTT OMFG REPUTATION."
The performance wasn't all glam for Swift, however, despite her gorgeous new outfits. The 14-time Grammy winner unfortunately swallowed yet another bug on stage, her third on the Eras Tour. Swift announced to the sold-out crowd at San Siro Stadium that she "swallowed another bug," while coughing before continuing her performance of "I Almost Do" mashed up with "The Moment I Knew."
