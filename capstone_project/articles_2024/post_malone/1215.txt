On Wednesday, Post Malone made his Grand Ole Opry debut, but he didn't do it alone. His performed "One More Last Chance" with Vince Gill, "Be My Baby Tonight" with John Michael Montgomery, "Nosedive" with Lainey Wilson, "Goes Without Saying" with Brad Paisley and "California Sober" with The War and Treaty. 
Now that milestone is safely tucked under his belt, he can move on to the next step in his country music journey. His hillbilly-laced album, F-1 Trillion, dropped at midnight Thursday. The project has already scored one number-one -- "I Had Some Help" with Morgan Wallen -- but "Pour Me a Drink" with Blake Shelton and "Guy for That" with Luke Combs are both skyrocketing up the charts.
