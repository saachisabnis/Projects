NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) — Collaborations with other artists from other genres are becoming more common in country music. In recent months, you may have noticed big names like Post Malone and Beyoncé giving country a try.
It's been met with mixed reviews, but artists tell FOX 17 News they're staying true to their roots.
During CMA Fest, making an appearance at SiriusXM The Highway’s Music Row Happy Hour, Brantley Gilbert caught up with us about his unique spot in country music.
However, hat road didn’t come easy. Gilbert says he saw some pushback from country music fans when starting out, but that didn't stop him from staying true to himself.
"I can't tell you how many times we were told we're not country or we're too rock for country, or too this or too that but you know we've always had a blast doing what we do," said Gilbert.
Gilbert says CMA Fest is a chance for music lovers to check out everything from that more traditional stuff, to rock country. Gilbert says he's just excited to share his music passion on stage with his fans.
"It's always a great time," he said.
Just announced on Friday, Gilbert has a new single coming out June 21 with Ashley Cooke.He leaves Nashville Friday night to perform with Jason Aldean in Florida tomorrow.
Over at Acme Feed and Seed, FOX 17 News caught up with a newer artist, David J.
"I'm really happy with what's going on with country music," said David J.
Also bringing his own flare to the country music scene with influences like Kane Brown and Morgan Wallen, David J started making TikToks in his car in the driveway during the pandemic, quickly growing his fan base, garnering almost  1 million followers on the social media platform before moving to Nashville.
David J feels bringing a  little bit of a twist to the genre opens up the fan base.
