There was little doubt as to which country song is No. 1 in August 2024. The top hit is No. 1 on sales, streaming and airplay charts to start the month.
Fans and critics are also in love with this catchy debut. The rest of the genre was competing for No. 2 on ToC's list of Top 40 country songs.
Post Malone's influence is all over this list. He notches three songs inside the Top 20, matching Morgan Wallen. Jelly Roll also has a pair of songs, including his new single "I Am Not Okay."
As always, the August 2024 list of the Top 40 country songs is equal parts airplay, sales and streaming charts, plus fan ratings. Staff opinion breaks any ties.
1. Shaboozey, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — No. 1 sales and streaming as the month begins. Shaboozey is also the No. 1 radio song on Aug. 1. It was an easy choice.
2. Post Malone (Feat. Morgan Wallen), “I Had Some Help” — This duet peaked on radio charts, but is not going away. These top two songs are the songs of the summer 2024.
3. Luke Combs, “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma” — Combs' hit from the Twisters soundtrack makes a big leap this month.
4. Marshmello & Kane Brown, “Miles on It” — Quietly, Marshmello has his first Top 20 country single. It's Top 10 on sales and streaming charts.
