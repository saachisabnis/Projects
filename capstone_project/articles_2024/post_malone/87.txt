Latto has joined forces with Jennifer Lopez on the remix of “Can’t Get Enough,” setting the tone for J. Lo’s long-awaited return.
Just weeks after releasing the lead single for her upcoming project, This is Me… Now— the sequel to her fan-favorite This Is Me… Then — Jenny from the block has given the track a Big Latto boost.

“Call the doctor, I don’t see nobody but you/ Do I still love you? Baby, is the sky blue?/ Spoil a bitch down and he faithful to me, too/ You know you the reason why they hatin’ on me, boo / Can’t get enough, like, let me get some mo’/ You know when it come to me, he love to do the most/ I ain’t scared of ghosts, he bought me one of those/ Keep ’em out our business, I ain’t tryna post,” Latto spits.
She continues: “Like, is it too good to be true?/ He romantic, but street too/ Drop a bag on a what?/ Put them M’s on my ass like Evisu/ Yeah, I love that shit/ Throwin’ up gang, so they know I’m his bitch/ That’s boo daddy/ He do anything to keep his boo happy.”

The track, which humorously references J.Lo’s tendency to quickly find men and marry them, boasts production credits from Rogét Chahayed, HitBoy, and Jeff “Hitty” Gitelman, among others.
While currently married to former flame Ben Affleck, her fourth marriage, Lopez’s love life hasn’t always been smooth sailing.. Her previous marriages include Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003, and Marc Anthony from 2004 to 2014. She reunited with Affleck in 2022 — the pair previously dated from 2002 to 2004.

In September, Billboard reported that Lopez was hard at work conjuring up her first solo album in nearly a decade under a deal she signed with BMG.
“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with her and her team to release her first album in nearly a decade,” said Thomas Coesfeld, BMG’s CEO in a statement to Billboard. “We are both excited and proud to partner with Jennifer Lopez on this long-awaited sequel to ‘This is Me… Then.’ Clearly written with love and through experience, ‘This Is Me..Now’ is uplifting and inspiring. ‘Jenny From The Block’ is back at a point in her career when her message is bigger than ever.”

More recently, it was reported that Fat Joe, Post Malone and Bad Bunny have been summoned to join the all-star roster of Jennifer Lopez’s upcoming film, which appears to be a fictionalized fantasy biopic to accompany her album release.
Earlier this month, the official trailer for This Is Me…Now: A Love Story went live, offering dramatic snippets of the singer and actress’s whimsical journey to finding love. Set to premiere on Amazon Prime on February 16, the 65-minute movie will drop the same day as J.Lo’s forthcoming offering, which shares the same title as its visual parallel.“The album and love story are unlike anything Jennifer Lopez has done before,” a press release states. “They explore her personal journey to love and the importance of self-love.”

Directed by Dave Meyers, the film will also star Trevor Noah, Kim Petras, Keke Palmer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Sadhguru, among other superstars.
The New York City native’s husband Ben Affleck will also make an appearance in the film. This is particularly noteworthy because he was the inspiration behind her 2002 album This Is Me… Then.
