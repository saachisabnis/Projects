Shaboozey‘s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is once again the No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following a temporary slide down to No. 2 last week, Shaboozey’s crossover hit retakes the top spot on the charts for the second time, after initially reaching No. 1 two weeks ago for the first time in the singer’s career. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is also sitting atop the Hot Country Songs chart for a sixth week. 
Elsewhere in the Top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100, Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, moves up a spot to No. 2, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” drops to No. 3 one week after retaking the top slot on the chart, Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” stays put at No. 4, and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” remains at No. 5. With Carpenter’s previous chart-topper, “Please Please Please,” sitting at No. 6, Sabrina now spends a sixth week with multiple songs in the Top 10, the most for any artist this year. (Billboard)
