The five priciest Denver-area home sales in June included a Highlands Ranch mansion purchased by the coach of the Denver Nuggets, a Cherry Hills Village mansion and three homes in Denver’s Cherry Creek, including two on the same block.
The top spot went to 460 Saint Paul St. in Denver. 460 Saint Paul LLC, a Colorado corporation formed on May 17, purchased the property from retired car dealer Jerry Glauser and his wife, Barbara, for $8.3 million. 
The five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home designed by architect Michael Knorr sits on one-third acre in Cherry Creek. It features 12-foot ceilings, heated floors, a spiral staircase, an elevator, a domed skylight and a two-story gym.

The Glausers purchased the home in 2004 for $4.2 million, then bought the one next door for $850,000. They scraped the latter and turned to Paul Kobey, the original builder, to expand the house.
They decided to sell it and buy something smaller in Denver because they own homes in Aspen, Arizona, and Florence, Italy.
“We love Denver, but we only spend about a month here a year, and it doesn’t make sense to have a 12,000-square-foot house,” Glauser said in 2023. “We wish we could take it with us.”
The Glausers initially listed the property with Kentwood Real Estate DTC for $14 million in 2019 before removing the listing. Kentwood relisted it for $11 million in June 2020 before again removing the listing. Douglas Kerbs with LIV Sotheby’s International Realty then listed the home for $11 million in March 2022 before lowering the price to $10 million in March.
Glauser owned several Glauser Mercedes-Benz dealerships, including one in Westminster, before selling them and retiring.
Kerbs represented both the buyer and sellers.  
According to MLS data, here are June’s next four most expensive home sales.
