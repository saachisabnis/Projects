Christopher Monroe, 44, of Little Rock, received a federal prison sentence of 17 and a half years for drug trafficking and gun-related crimes. U.S. District Judge Brian Miller issued the sentence Wednesday, following Monroe’s April guilty plea to charges including intent to distribute fentanyl and methamphetamine, illegal firearm possession, and using a firearm in drug trafficking.
On May 20, 2023, Arkansas State Police (ASP) tried to stop Monroe on Interstate 40 in North Little Rock due to outstanding warrants from Sherwood. Monroe attempted to evade police, leading officers on a high-speed pursuit through Sherwood and Little Rock before a Tactical Vehicle Intervention brought his GMC Sierra to a halt on Roosevelt Road.
A search of Monroe’s vehicle uncovered over 300 grams of methamphetamine, 109 grams of fentanyl, along with cocaine, marijuana, oxycodone, cash, and a loaded .45 caliber firearm. Additional drug paraphernalia and controlled substances were also found in a safe.
Monroe’s criminal record includes convictions for drug-related offenses, illegal firearm possession, and domestic battery. Judge Miller’s sentence considered Monroe’s history, adding five years of supervised release post-prison.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) led the investigation, with support from ASP and the Sherwood Police Department. Federal sentencing rules mean Monroe will serve his sentence without the possibility of parole.
