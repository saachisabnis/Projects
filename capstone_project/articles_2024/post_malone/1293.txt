Donald Trump has won in Michigan, completing his rout of the “blue wall” in a landslide election victory that lays the ground for a radical second term in office.
The president-elect won an estimated 49.7 per cent of the vote in Michigan, outstripping Kamala Harris at 48.3 per cent.
Victory in the state confirmed Trump’s clean sweep of the three blue wall states, which also included Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that Democrats had believed mapped out their clearest path to winning the White House.
The Republicans have won 292 electoral college votes so far, well clear of the 270-vote threshold needed to win the presidential race, and have also reclaimed the Senate. The House has still not been called.
Addressing supporters during his victory speech in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said the resounding victory had given him an “unprecedented and powerful mandate” to rule.
Trump’s win leaves the Democrats in tatters and his opponent Kamala Harris humiliated after one of the shortest presidential campaigns in history ended in a heavy defeat fuelled by a swathe of unlikely voters.
She conceded the election in a private call to Trump on Wednesday afternoon.

Mr Biden is expected to make public remarks on Thursday.
Nikki Haley, who was Donald Trump’s longest-standing challengers in the 2024 Republican primary, has said that the President-elect “defied gravity” with his win.
“He got through two assassination attempts. He got through two impeachments, he got through numerous indictments, and America still elected him because, at the end of the day, they knew what they were getting with Donald Trump. And that’s what they wanted to see,” she told her radio show.
Ms Haley endorsed Trump but was largely absent from the Republican campaign trail.
She called his victory “a great moment for democracy”.
Kamala Harris has been slammed by a Democratic councillor for not thanking her supporters following her election defeat.

Ms Harris has not spoken publically since leaving her election watch party at Howard University last night.
Donald Trump has won the battleground state of Michigan.
The President-elect continued his hoovering up of the key swing states by winning an estimated 49.7 per cent of the vote, outstripping Kamala Harris on 48.3 per cent.
Victory in Michigan confirmed Trump’s clean sweep of the three blue wall states, which also included Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that Democrats had believed was their clearest path towards winning the White House.
The Republican candidate now sits on 292 electoral college votes, well clear of the 270-vote threshold needed to win the election, with just a handful of states still to be call.
He is expected to make further substantial gains in Arizona and Nevada - the two swing states left to be announced.
Kamala Harris will address her supporters at Howard University at 4 pm.
Harris supporters in the Washington DC area received text messages inviting them to an event at the college this evening.
“We invite you to join the Harris-Walz campaign for an event with Vice President Kamala Harris today at Howard University in Washington, DC,” read the text. “Doors will open at 1pm.”
The vice president is expected to call Donald Trump today in order to concede the election.

Robert F Kennedy Jr has renewed his pledge to remove fluoride from drinking water.
“I think fluoride is on it’s way out,” the former presidential candidate told NBC. “I think the faster it goes out the better.”
Explaining his reasons, Mr Kennedy said “it’s lowering IQ in our children” and “it’s causing bone cancer”.
For 80 years, fluoride has been added to drinking water in the USA to improve dental health. However, Mr Kennedy has vowed to remove it if, as promised, Donald Trump puts him in charge of health policy in his new administration.

Kamala Harris has been radio silent this morning following her stunning election defeat, reports suggest.
The vice president, who is yet to concede to Donald Trump, has not been seen publically since departing her campaign watch party last night.
After she was swept away in the key swing states, campaign insiders told Fox News Ms Harris is uncontactable this morning and has not provided talking points to surrogates donors or influencers.
One source told the outlet they received no response even after reaching out.
The Telegraph has spoken to a prominent Ukrainian American about Trump’s vow to end the war in a day. He says it gives a message to the world that aggression is acceptable.
Kari Lake is losing the race for the US Senate in Arizona, according to early projections, writes Kieran Kelly.
The contest has been one of the most closely watched Senate races during the election as the Democrats hope to hold a seat being vacated by Kyrsten Sinema, who left the party after a row with its left-wing two years ago.
At the time of writing, the Democrats’ Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran, has won 50.4 per cent of the votes, compared with 47.6 per cent for Ms Lake.
The race between Ms Lake and Mr Gallego has tightened in the last few hours with around 1.3 million votes still to be counted.
She is one of the more controversial supporters of Trump having repeatedly refused to concede that she lost the 2022 governor’s race, despite being defeated by more than 17,000 votes.
Ms Lake, a former local news anchor, is widely known for pushing unfounded claims about election fraud.
Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te has joined world leaders in congratulating Donald Trump with a plea to preserve regional stability.
Ties between Washington and Taipei have grown stronger in recent years, as Beijing ratchets up military and diplomatic pressure on the island, which it claims sovereignty over.
Although the US is obliged by law to supply Taiwan’s defence, Trump has previously dodged questions over whether he will continue funding for the island.
Sincere congratulations to President-elect @realDonaldTrump on your victory. I'm confident that the longstanding #Taiwan-#US partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.

Vladimir Putin and privately congratulated Donald Trump on election victory, a Russian opposition website has said, citing Kremlin sources and MPs.
Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, previously said that Putin had no plans to congratulate Trump, but reporters at Vyorstka said that the Russian leader and senior officials have gone through the Russian foreign ministry to commend him informally.
According to The Times, the unnamed sources said the move was linked to hopes that Trump would slash military support to Ukraine.

A pollster known as the “Nostradamus” of elections was shocked after failing to predict Donald Trump’s commanding win on Tuesday night.
“I don’t get it,” Professor Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted nine of the 10 presidential elections since 1984, said on a livestream.
“I’m not doing any interviews, I’m done,” he added, according to the Daily Mail.
Professor Lichtman was not the only well-known pollster to be wrong-footed by the Republican candidate’s victory.
Ann Selzer, nicknamed “Iowa’s polling queen”, had predicted that Kamala Harris would take the Hawkeye State by three points in a shock poll just days before the election.
In the end, Trump won it by more than 13 points.
Liz Cheney, the former Republican representative, has said Donald Trump needs “guardrails” after his election victory on Tuesday night.
“Our nation’s democratic system functioned last night and we have a new President-elect. All Americans are bound, whether we like the outcome or not, to accept the results of our elections,” Ms Cheney, who campaigned with Kamala Harris against Trump, wrote on social media.
“We now have a special responsibility, as citizens of the greatest nation on earth, to do everything we can to support and defend our Constitution, preserve the rule of law, and ensure that our institutions hold over these coming four years.
“Citizens across this country, our courts, members of the press and those serving in our federal, state and local governments must now be the guardrails of democracy.”

Donald Trump’s golf courses in Scotland are flying the Stars and Stripes after the Republican candidate’s election victory.
The US flag is being flown at Trump International in Aberdeenshire, which Sarah Malone, its executive vice president, said was to mark a “wonderful and historic win” by a “true leader”.
“It is no surprise to us that he [Trump] prevailed so emphatically in the election because he and his family put heart and soul into everything they do. We have seen it here at his golf resorts in Scotland,” she added.
Sir Keir Starmer intends to work with Donald Trump on Ukraine in the “months and years ahead”, the British Prime Minister’s spokesman has said.
“We welcome sustained bipartisan US support for Ukraine which has been absolutely key in the international effort, and the UK’s support for Ukraine will remain ironclad,” the spokesman said.
“This is obviously among many issues that the Prime Minister looks forward to working with the president elect on in the coming months and years ahead.”
Trump has previously said that he will end the war in Ukraine on his first day in office.
Kamala Harris has yet to concede or even speak to Donald Trump following his election victory, Fox News reports.
Ms Harris has also did not address her supporters on Tuesday night, with representatives saying she would address the state of the race on Wednesday.
Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, has said Donald Trump won the election by “fundamentally remaking” the Republican party.
Exit polls showed that the Republican presidential candidate had made inroads with black and Latino men.
“What I’m most impressed by is not just the size of the victory, I know the number is still growing, but the way Donald Trump won this election,” Mr Rubio, whom Trump considered as a potential running mate, told CNN.
“He won it by fundamentally remaking the Republican Party, but I hope also revealing to people that for voters in the United States of America, their primary identity is not their ethnicity. It’s not their race.
“It’s what they do for a living. It’s who’s who they are in their daily lives.”
A Donald Trump aide has told the media that the president elect will hold another rally “soon” - having gone on a “thank you tour” after defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Justin Trudeau has congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory and declared that he will work with the Republican.
Mr Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, wrote on social media: “Congratulations to Donald Trump on being elected President of the United States.
“The friendship between Canada and the U.S. is the envy of the world.
“I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations.”
Democrats have suffered “a total and complete repudiation” after losing control of the Senate while Kamala Harris fell short in the White House race, a party source has said.
The individual told Punchbowl News: “This was as bad as I’ve ever seen.
“This was a total and complete repudiation of the Democratic party. People are not buying what we’re selling. Period.”
Sir Keir Starmer has been told to apologise after a member of his cabinet branded Donald Trump a “neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath”.
David Lammy, the British Foreign Secretary, made the remarks about the Republican presidential candidate in an article for Time magazine in 2018, while he was a backbench MP.
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in Parliament on Wednesday: “I would like to start by congratulating president elect Trump on his impressive victory this morning. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary met him in September.
“Did the Foreign Secretary take that opportunity apologise for making derogatory and scatological references, including... Trump is not only a ‘women-hating neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath’, he is also a ‘profound threat to the international order?’”
“And if he did not apologise, will the Prime Minister do so now on his behalf?”
Boris Johnson, the former British prime minister, has sent “huge congratulations” to Donald Trump for his “amazing victory”.
“I have no doubt he will now set about making America strong at home and abroad,” he wrote on social media.
Germany’s press have met the news of Mr Trump’s victory with disbelief and anxiety, Jörg Luyken writes.
Popular weekly Die Zeit led its website on Wednesday with a one word expletive: “F---.”
The headline was followed by a report on how watching the news roll in meant that “in the end, all that remained was helpless attempts to calm oneself.”
Der Spiegel, the country’s major political magazine, led its website with the headline “the Trump shock,” while conservative daily Die Welt claimed that “a new era in time” has begun.
The US is Germany’s major trading partner and the country fears that Mr Trump’s promise to impose tariffs could end the era of globalisation that has driven German wealth over decades.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Mr Trump on Twitter, stating that Berlin and Washington would continue to work closely “for the benefit of our people.”
Kamala Harris has been accused of picking the wrong running mate as the Democratic blame game over her humiliating election defeat began.
The US vice-president appeared on course to lose every one of the seven swing states that determined the White House race.
Ms Harris, 60, declined to address the nation on election night, leading Democratic operatives to fill the vacuum.
Some blamed her choice of Tim Walz, the unassuming Minnesota governor, as her vice-presidential candidate.
The leading alternative had been Josh Shapiro, the charismatic and popular governor of all-important Pennsylvania.

Republican Tim Sheehy has won a Senate seat in Montana, ousting Jon Tester, the Democrat who was seeking a fourth term. The development will expand the Republican majority in the Senate.
It is still unclear when Kamala Harris is going to make a concession speech, with a source close to her team saying she needs “time”.
“Please give the Harris campaign time to define their own strengths and weaknesses,” the individual told CNN.

Nigel Farage added that Donald Trump was “laid back” and eating an ice cream on election night.
“Amidst all this sort of craziness, there sitting at a table just calmly chatting to everybody was Donald Trump,” he told LBC.
“He had an ice cream, you just couldn’t believe how laid back he was... the guy’s got no nerves. He’s just got no nerves.”
Nigel Farage has claimed that Donald Trump has mounted “the greatest political comeback of modern times” and compared him to Winston Churchill.
He told LBC: “I can’t think of anybody since Churchill who’s been to such heights, sunk to such depths and come back again… the whole thing’s unbelievable.
“What he said may not be all directly achievable, but that’s not the point. Churchill said, during the Blitz, we will move on. We will go through this to the sunlit uplands. You have to offer people a vision of hope.”
Kamala Harris has been projected to win New Hampshire and its four electoral college votes.
Donald Trump has been projected to win the swing state of Wisconsin and its 10 electoral college votes.
Donald Trump has amassed enough electoral college votes to win the presidential election, according to multiple projections.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said: “I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump on his election as the 47th President of the United States of America. I look forward to working with President Trump again to advance a strong transatlantic agenda.
“The European Union and the United States are more than just allies. We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens.
“This bond runs deep, rooted in our shared history, commitment to freedom and democracy, and common goals of security and opportunity for all.
“Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens. Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship.”
A senior Democrat has said that the party needs to hold an “autopsy” to work out why it is failing to appeal to Latino voters.
Julian Castro, who was appointed to Barack Obama’s cabinet and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, told NBC News: “Something happened between 2016 and 2020, because the first significant drop-off we saw in places like south Texas was not this year but in 2020.
“The Democratic Party is going to have to do the inverse of what the Republican Party did in 2012, which is an autopsy to try and figure out what happened there.”
Narendra Modi has offered his “heartiest congratulations” to his “friend” Donald Trump.
The Indian prime minister wrote on social media: “As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.
“Together, let’s work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity.”
Unlike other countries around the world, Russia has not reacted to the presidential election result.
The Kremlin, which has repeatedly been accused of meddling in elections by US security services, said it was an internal American matter when asked for a statement.
In Donald Trump’s own words, his second term will be “nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning in particular”.
Unlike his surprise win in 2016, when the Republicans’ preparations for America’s highest office were chaotic and marred by infighting, the 78-year-old has a fully-formed plan for what he will do once he holds the levers of power in 2025.
His “day one” agenda involves rapid and aggressive action to target illegal immigration, a mass purge of the federal government and a grievance-filled agenda to pursue opponents.

Kamala Harris lost because she focused on attacking Donald Trump instead of setting out her own plans, a pollster has claimed.
Frank Luntz wrote on social media: “Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump.
“Voters already know everything there is about Trump – but they still wanted to know more about Harris’ plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration.
“It was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris’ own ideas.”
Ann Selzer has said she will be “reviewing” why her poll dramatically overestimated Kamala Harris’ support in Iowa.
The renowned pollster had predicted that Ms Harris would take the state, which had voted for Donald Trump twice, by three points. On election night it opted for the Republican instead by a margin of around 14 points, with more than 90 per cent of the votes in.
“The poll findings we produced for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom did not match what the Iowa electorate ultimately decided in the voting booth today,” Ms Selzer said in a statement.
“I’ll be reviewing data from multiple sources with hopes of learning why that happened. And, I welcome what that process might teach me.”
Kamala Harris is widely projected to win Minnesota - the home of her running mate, Tim Walz - and its 10 electoral college votes.

Barack Obama’s former campaign manager has admitted “we got our butts kicked” because Democrats failed to communicate with young voters and Latinos.
Jim Messina told MSNBC: “Going forward, the Democrats have a real rural problem, and they have real communication challenges to a whole bunch of groups, including young voters and Latinos, that we thought we had a better message to and just didn’t at all.”
He added: “I hope we don’t all rush. I hope we all take some time look at all these things, do a comprehensive report and talk about how to move forward, because we got our butts kicked tonight.”
Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary-general, has said the military alliance helps “advance US interests” as he congratulated Donald Trump. He said in a statement:
I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through Nato.
Through Nato, the US has 31 friends and Allies who help to advance US interests, multiply American power and keep Americans safe.
Together, Nato Allies represent half of the world’s economic might and half of the world’s military might.
We face a growing number of challenges globally, from a more aggressive Russia, to terrorism, to strategic competition with China, as well the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Working together through Nato helps to deter aggression, protect our collective security, and support our economies.
President-elect Trump demonstrated strong US leadership throughout his first term in office – a term that turned the tide on European defence spending, improved transatlantic burden sharing, and strengthened Alliance capabilities.

The Ukrainian president said the Republican candidate could “bring just peace in Ukraine closer”, adding: “We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership.
“We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.
“We are interested in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.”
Trump has previously claimed he will end the Russia-Ukraine war in a day and derided Zelensky as a “salesman” who kept securing military aid from the US.

Donald Trump said on Tuesday morning that he had not prepared a victory speech, and that much was clear as he took to the stage at 2.30am today in West Palm Beach to thank his supporters.
In a perambulatory address, Trump repeated some of his favourite anecdotes from the campaign &boxh; including a long story about Elon Musk’s recent aerospace successes. He also invited several members of his team up to speak to the crowd. A rather alarmed looking Chris LaCivita, one of his senior advisers, spoke for barely 20 seconds to thank his boss.
The speech was a classic example of the trademark Trump “weave”, in which he lumbers from topic to topic as a rhetorical device. The most rousing moments came at the start, when he told the raucous crowd they had helped “the greatest political movement of all time” and pledged to “fix everything about our country”.
It was also a reminder of the rapid change in public speaking style Americans must prepare for after January 20. The bumbling days of Biden are almost over, and the era of bizarre rambling is upon us.
“It’s time to put the divisons of the past four years behind us, it’s time to unite - and we’re going to try,” Donald Trump says.
“Success is going to bring us together and we are gonig to start by putting America first... because together we can truly make America great again for all Americans.”
Trump has now finished his speech, and YMCA - the song that is usually played to end his campaign rallies - rings out.
Donald Trump declares he will never do another campaign rally, claiming to have held around 900 this year. “But now we’re going onto something far more important,” he adds.
“Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason and that reason was to save our country, and to restore America to greatness,” he continues.
“And now we are going to fulfil that mission together... I will bring every ounce of energy, spirit and fight to the job that you’ve entrusted to me.”
Donald Trump says of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr: “He wants to do some things and we’re going to go do it.”
He adds: “I just said, ‘Bobby, leave the oil to me.. Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold, other than that - go have a good time, Bobby.”
“This is what happens when the machine comes after you... couldn’t stop him, keeps coming forward... this is karma, ladies and gentleman,” Dana White, the head of the UFC who introduced Trump at the Republican convention, tells the crowd.
Donald Trump responds: “He is a piece of work.”
Donald Trump thanks his campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. “Susie likes to stay... in the back... we like to call her the ice maiden,” he adds. “I’ve never seen her be shy before.”
He also thanks Elon Musk, declaring: “A star is born - Elon... He spent two weeks in Philadelphia and different parts of Pennsylvania, campaigning.”
Trump adds: “We have to protect our super geniuses.”
JD Vance says he has witnessed “the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America”. He adds that under Donald Trump they will lead “the great economic comeback”.
Trump responds: “He’s turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew the brain was a good one - about as good as it gets.”
“I want to be the first to congratulate our great, now I can say, vice president elect of the United States,” Donald Trump says, referring to his running mate JD Vance.
He calls Mr Vance a “feisty one” who “obliterates” interviewers when he does a media round.
“It also looks like we’ll be keeping control of the House of Representatives,” Donald Trump claims.
The Republican thanks his wife Melania, “who has the number one bestselling book in the country... she’s done a great job, works very hard to help people.”
Trump thanks his “amazing children... thank you all.”
“Winning the popular vote was very nice, very nice,” Donald Trump says. “It’s a great feeling of love”
“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, we have taken back control of the Senate - wow,” he continues.
“Every single day I will be fighting for you... this is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again,” Donald Trump says.
He adds: “We are now winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska which would result in us carrying at least 315 electoral votes.”
“This was I believe the greatest political movement of all time,” Donald Trump says, addressing his supporters.
“And now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal... we made history for a reason tonight.”
“It it’s now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing - look what happened, isn’t this crazy?”
Donald Trump is making his way onto the stage to address supporters, accompanied by his family.
Republican strategist Dennis Lennox says: “You really can’t overstate the significance of Trump’s restoration as the first president in the modern era to win a second, non-consecutive term.
“Forget Nixon or Cleveland. This is the biggest comeback in American political history, given how many times he was considered down and out.”
Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, has declared that Donald Trump has won the presidential election.
He said in a statement released to media:
There is hope and morning in America again! Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this.
The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponised government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage - demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity.
This historic moment requires a proven leader with a record of success and the unwavering resolve necessary to fight for every American, tackle the many challenges we all face, and return our country to greatness.
President Donald Trump is that leader.
Tucker Carlson has now turned up at the convention centre. The crowd is now chanting we want Trump we want Trump . I’m told it’s now two minutes until the appearance of the former president turned next president of the United States.
Pennsylvania is fond of claiming it is the state that picks the president. It can credibly claim that mantle tonight.
Kamala Harris’ hopes of winning the White House had hinged on high turnout in the Keystone State’s urban areas.
It is Pennsylvania’s politically distinctive regions that led the Democratic strategist James Carville to coin the expression: “Pennsylvania is Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in the middle”.
In the end, Ms Harris failed to secure a high enough turnout in the state’s two major cities and the counties surrounding it to counter Trump’s dominance in the Republican heartlands.
She lost the most critical of all, Bucks County, the swingiest of swing counties in the all-important state, to Trump.
CNN has called Pennsylvania for Donald Trump, after Fox News made the same call. It effectively means that the Republican candidate has won the 2024 presidential election and puts the White House out of reach for Kamala Harris.
Follow our coverage of how election night unfolded here.
The result will prompt a lengthy blame game among Democrats over who is responsible for the loss, and debate over whether Mr Biden should have left the race sooner to allow Ms Harris more time to campaign or another candidate to be chosen.
Mr Biden stood down on July 21, after weeks of speculation about his health and mental agility following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June.
Trump’s inauguration will take place on January 20, at the US Capitol &boxh; where his supporters rioted four years ago.
He has also pledged to reduce the size of the federal government by shuttering the Education Department, moving 100,000 civil servants out of Washington DC and establishing a new office for efficiency led by Elon Musk.
Trump’s election will likely see the end of two federal criminal cases against him, over alleged election subversion and mishandling of classified documents.
However, a third case over alleged election interference in Georgia after the 2020 race may continue, and he is due to be sentenced for convictions from his so-called “hush money” trial in New York on November 26. As president, Trump will have no power to quash state criminal rulings.
In office, Trump has said he will seek “retribution” against his enemies and may look to prosecute political rivals and election workers he views as responsible for his 2020 loss and legal woes.
Trump has denied that he has plans for a federal abortion ban, and has said he will leave individual states to legislate on the issue.
