Kim Petras became the first openly transgender artist to win in a major category at the Grammy Awards in 2023
Singer Kim Petras has cancelled all of her summer festival performances this year due to "health issues".
In a statement on X she said she was "devastated to be writing" the message but made the decision "under medical advice".
The German pop star didn't specify what medical problems she was experiencing. 
She had been scheduled to appear at the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona in May and London's Mighty Hoopla festival in June.
She told fans: "I love u so much and I'll make it up to you and be back better than ever very soon."
In 2023, Petras became the first openly transgender artist to win in a major category at the Grammy Awards for her collaboration with Sam Smith, Unholy, in the best pop duo/group performance category.
The song also marked her first UK number one hit, and she told Newsbeat at the time: "I'm really grateful. Of course, as a kid I would have loved to see someone getting number one in the UK as a trans woman or trans man."
