Full Bio
Post Malone already has country hits on his hands with Morgan Wallen and Blake Shelton, now his biggest competition might be from himself. And Luke Combs, too.
Luke posted a teaser of his new song with Posty, and it's probably gonna break some records. The song's called "Guy for That" and it'll be on Posty's album "F-1 Trillion" that comes out August 16th.
Luke's caption was simple. He said, "We doin' this or what?" And then tagged Post Malone.  There's no word if we'll get the full song before the album drops.
You can check out his post, and listen to the teaser here...
