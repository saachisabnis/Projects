Post Malone’s fans were thrilled when his new country album, F-1 Trillion, was released just after midnight on Friday, August 16, 2024. 
But the excitement didn’t stop there. Less than 12 hours later, Malone surprised everyone by releasing a deluxe version of the album called F-1 Trillion: Long Bed. 
This extended edition includes nine brand-new tracks, giving fans even more to enjoy.
F-1 Trillion: Long Bed is not just an ordinary deluxe album. It’s an expanded version of Malone’s country debut that dives deeper into his personal connection with the genre. 
While the original album featured 18 songs, many of which were collaborations with big names in country music, this new version focuses on Malone’s solo work.
The additional tracks show a side of Malone that fans may not have seen before. 
He explores his love for country music in a way that’s personal and heartfelt, highlighting his talent as a solo artist.
In this deluxe edition, Malone takes a step back from the collaborations that filled his original release. 
Instead, he focuses on songs that he could have created if he had gone solo from the start. 
These tracks are a reflection of his love for country music, something that has been a part of his life since childhood.
In a social media post, Malone shared his excitement about the new release, writing, “9 more solo records. F-1 Trillion: Long Bed out now :)” 
With the addition of these nine new tracks, the album’s total count rises to 27 songs. 
Each of these new tracks offers something unique, with a strong emphasis on traditional country sounds. Here’s a look at the titles of the new songs:
These songs are guitar-driven and rich with the sounds of classic country music. 
Instruments like the fiddle, steel guitar, and banjo give the tracks a timeless feel, reminiscent of the country hits from the past.
The release of F-1 Trillion: Long Bed is significant for several reasons. First, it shows Post Malone’s commitment to exploring country music on his terms. 
By adding these nine solo tracks, he gives fans a glimpse into his deep connection with the genre, something that goes beyond the collaborations in the original album.
This deluxe edition also highlights Malone’s versatility as an artist. 
While he’s known for his work in hip-hop and pop, F-1 Trillion: Long Bed proves that he’s just as comfortable in the country music world. 
The new tracks show his ability to blend different musical styles while staying true to the roots of country music.
With these nine additional songs, fans are left wondering if Post Malone has even more surprises up his sleeve. 
While F-1 Trillion: Long Bed feels like a complete project, it’s clear that Malone is full of creative energy. 
Whether he plans to release more music soon or focus on live performances, one thing is certain: Post Malone’s journey into country music is far from over.
For now, fans can enjoy the expanded F-1 Trillion: Long Bed album and dive into the world of Post Malone’s solo country tracks. 
It’s a journey that’s only just beginning, and who knows what exciting twists and turns lie ahead?
Although some fans were surprised to see Post Malone trading his signature cornrows for a cowboy hat, he always planned to go country by age 30. 
While he’s only 29, he feels like the fast life has made him age quicker. 
Country music, like the blues, often tells stories of life’s struggles, and Posty believes that even pop stars can feel the weight of those challenges. 
He shared in an interview that just a few years ago, he was in a dark place, dealing with the pressures of fame by crying, drinking, and trying to get through each day. 
Now, he’s happy and settled with his fiancée and daughter, and this change is reflected in his music. 
His new country album features more honest and clear vocals, leaving behind the distorted, emotional style of his earlier hits. 
Posty brings his sharp lyricism to the forefront, embracing the storytelling and wordplay of classic country music. 
He also enjoys collaborating with country legends like Tim McGraw, Blake Shelton, Lainey Wilson, and Dolly Parton, blending their styles to create a fresh sound that’s both authentic and relatable.
He teams up with some of country’s biggest names, creating songs that blend his unique style with their country roots. 
On the opening track, “Wrong Ones,” he joins forces with Tim McGraw, known for his smooth vocals, to reflect on the wild side of fame. 
Blake Shelton, a major star from the 2000s bro-country era, adds his polished voice to “Pour Me a Drink,” where the two sing about drowning their sorrows after a tough day. 
Lainey Wilson brings a touch of tenderness to the heartbreak song “Nosedive,” adding depth to the melody. 
And in “Have the Heart,” Posty partners with the legendary Dolly Parton, whose energy and chemistry light up the track. 
These collaborations show Posty’s respect for country music’s history while also pushing the genre forward in new and exciting ways.
