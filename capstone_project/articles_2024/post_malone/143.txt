Post Malone is revving the engine on his new releases, already mapping out a lengthy North American Tour in support of his forthcoming new project. Dubbed the F-1 Trillion Tour, Posty will hit the road this fall to perform his first-ever country record in 20 major venues.
“I love y’all so very much and I’m so excited to get out and play new music for you,” he said in a release.
Per Live Nation’s announcement, the singer is set to perform tracks from his discography – both old and new – as well as “a collection of country songs.”
