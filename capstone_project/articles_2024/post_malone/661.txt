Blake Shelton is headed to Norman, Okla. on Saturday to serve as the guest picker for ESPN's College Gameday, but there's just one little problem — he's clueless!
The country singer admitted his lack of knowledge while visiting with the Pat McAfee Show on Thursday (Sept. 19). He says all of his buddies encouraged him to do the show, but ...
"Of course, everybody said, 'You gotta do it,'" Shelton shares. "I said yeah, but I don't know s--t about all these teams he's gonna ask me about."
Shelton explains that as a born-and-raised Okie, he is a fan of both the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
"I don't know if it's legal to be both or not, but I always have been," he admits. "I always pull for all three of the teams — Tulsa too."
Fans can watch Shelton on College Gameday this Saturday, Sept. 21.
The show travels to various college campuses to conduct their broadcast, and this weekend they'll be on the campus of the University of Oklahoma as the Sooners host the Tennessee Volunteers.
Gameday airs on ESPN each Saturday at 9AM ET.
Shelton is making some music moves since he left The Voice. In addition to releasing a collaboration with Post Malone called "Pour Me a Drink," the country veteran has left his longtime record label home. He also announced the 2025 Friends and Heroes Tour with Trace Adkins, Deana Carter and Craig Morgan.
