Forbes magazine recently reported that Journey’s classic track “Don’t Stop Believin’” was “officially the biggest song of all time,” and it’s gotten the band’s former frontman Steve Perry in a reflective mood.
In a post on Instagram, Perry, who left Journey in 1987, writes that the article left him “emotionally stunned.”  
“To be part of such a moment as this made me reflect on my parents,” he shares. “By that I mean, though I lost them both years ago, I was so happy for them because they are truly the reason this is happening.”
He adds “My dad was a singer and both of them were very musical. So on behalf of my Mom and Dad, I thank every one of you for so many years of support.”
Forbes‘ report claimed that “Don’t Stop Believin’” was the biggest song because it was recently certified 18-times Platinum by the RIAA. It shares the milestone with Post Malone and Swae Lee’s “Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse),” which earned the same certification in May.
