Although already producing a promising career in the music industry, Post Malone looked to expand his stardom outside of hip-hop and pop. Having sold over 80 million albums, Malone shocked fans when he announced his debut country album F-1 Trillion. Already gaining praise, the singer recently performed for a sea of fans who appeared to love every song. And taking a moment to sign pictures and posters, Malone was left speechless when one fan decided to give him a custom belt buckle that cost thousands. 
While Malone is always willing to make a fan’s night with a simple meeting, the singer got a surprise with one fan wanted to give him something. Taking some time to come down to the railing, the country singer signed all sorts of memorabilia before one woman handed him a box with a belt buckle inside of it. Malone repeatedly said, “For me? This is stunning. This is f***ing beautiful… This is insane. This is insane.”
Made by Molly’s Custom Silver, the belt buckle featured the saying “Posty Born To Be Country” on it. Again, not knowing what to say about the gift, the fan asked Malone to wear the buckle at his concert in Nashville as she hoped to be there. If the moment wasn’t special enough, Malone turned around and gifted the fan his Chrome Hearts belt buckle off his body. For reference, a Chrome Hearts belt buckle will usually run you a few thousand dollars.

Thankfully, other fans caught the special moment and posted videos showing the interaction. Looking at the comments, they included, “Here’s a fun fact: Post Malone has always been that guy. He has always been humble, even before he became super famous.” Another person added, “I adore how completely baffled he is every time someone gives him something! Like, “For me???” It’s just the sweetest.”

Overcome with emotions about the meeting, the fan could barely keep her composure as Malone continued to make his way down the line. And only time will tell if the singer keeps his word and flashes the belt buckle on stage. But given his connection with fans, you can bet Malone will surely showcase his country bling in the near future.
