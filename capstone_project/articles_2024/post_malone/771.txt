BIDEN INNOCENT—VICTIM OF CHEAP SHOT
The fact that President Joe Biden is a senior citizen is not going to go away. The world is full of successful senior citizens and the president is one of them. Accomplishments in his first term in office are remarkable, and yes, people accuse him of being a senior citizen in that campaign. Through his many years of service, along with getting older, he gained the knowledge that has made him the most experienced and knowledgeable person on both foreign and domestic affairs in the country. No one has more years of government service. His aids say he’s always the sharpest in the room and always on top of the subject. Personally, I consider age just a number. Warren Buffett runs the country’s most successful business, he’s 94. Rupert Murdock, Fox CEO, is 93. Hundreds of movie executives are in their late 80’s. I consider 80 the new 65. When I was a child the life expectancy was in the 50’s. I’ve told you before I have attorney friends in their mid-80’s who are still practicing law and winning. My friend Ray Cotton is 93 and calls anyone under 85 “a kid.” Joe Biden is in good health both physically and mentally. Political observers strongly criticized the special counsel, Robert Hur, for extensively discussing the president’s age and allegedly fading memory in his report on Biden’s retention of classified information from his time as a senator and as vice-president, which did not produce an indictment. Hur, who Donald Trump appointed US attorney for Maryland “could not refrain from investigative excess,” said 
Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal counsel. Others raised the specter of James Comey, the FBI director who in 2016 investigated Hillary Clinton over her use of private email in office. Declining to indict, Comey chose instead to publicly cast doubt on Clinton’s character, an act widely held to have helped tip the election for Trump. Dan Pfeiffer, a Barack Obama adviser turned commentator, called Hur’s report “a partisan hit job.”
“It’s hard to read the report and not think that, without the ability to charge Biden with a crime, Hur wanted to damage him politically.” Pfeiffer added: “If Biden acts like Hur says, we would all know. Biden meets with dozens of people daily, if he was regularly misremembering, or making other mistakes that suggested he was not up to the job, it would be in the press. Washington is not capable of keeping something like that secret.” By the way, if Donald Trump is elected he would be the oldest senior citizen to ever be elected president of the United States.

TRUMP ENCOURAGES RUSSIA TO ATTACK NATO ALLIES
Donald Trump’s claim that he once told a NATO ally that he would encourage Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to “delinquent” members of the group sent shockwaves through Europe over the weekend. As he moved closer to winning the Republican presidential nomination a third straight time, Trump’s tightening grip on the GOP is reshaping the party’s traditional defense of longstanding military alliances and rejection of Moscow, positions that date back to the days of the Soviet Union. Trump has a long history of denigrating NATO, and former administration officials say he repeatedly threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance that has been central to U.S. policy for decades. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, now Trump’s last major rival for the Republican nomination, told reporters Monday she was “appalled” by Trump’s comment and questioned why he was siding against “our allies who were with us after 9/11.” President Biden said Trump’s remarks were un-American and dangerous. Trump “talked many times about getting out of NATO behind closed doors and publicly. So that’s just a fact.” John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser and now a strident critic, said he believed Trump would almost certainly try to withdraw from NATO if he wins a second term. Trump is often criticized for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and suggesting cuts to aid to Ukraine as it fights Russia’s offensive. Trump's comments came at a rally in Conway, South Carolina, where he told a familiar story aimed at demonstrating his negotiating prowess. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’” Trump recounted telling the person. “He said: ‘Yes. Let’s say that happened.’ “No I would not protect you,” Trump said, adding: “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.” It remains unclear whether the conversation Trump recounted Saturday actually took place. The former president has a long history of fabrications and exaggerations. Aides declined to answer questions about the conversation.
C’EST TOUT
Today, Wednesday, February14, Valentine’s Day, is also the first day of Lent. The religious season will last 40 days ending Easter Sunday. Being raised a Catholic youngster my family took very seriously the Lenten season and attended all church ceremonies. We never ate meat on Friday and many Catholics still observe that tradition. Those were special times in my youth that have never left me.*****Election Day, March 5, is fast approaching. Early Voting begins February 20 and ends March 1. We suggest you look the candidates over. We thank them for offering themselves to public service. Also despite local elections just in Republican Primaries, it is also the Democratic Primaries for state and national contestants. Don’t stay home just because there are no local races. Red or Blue, VOTE. ***** I’d best finish up and get this turned in. Be sure to read us cover to cover. Shop our family of advertisers when you can and tell them we sent you. Thanks for your time.
