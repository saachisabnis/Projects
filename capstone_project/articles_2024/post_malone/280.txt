Can you say “low cultural IQ?”
In recent Hip Hop exchanges, Kendrick Lamar’s lyrical challenge to Drake regarding his use of the word “nigga” has stirred significant controversy. Kendrick’s critique, however, has been misclassified by many outside the culture as colorism. Instead, it serves as a pointed call to protect Black cultural expressions from superficial appropriation and I will explain why.
The current rivalry between Kendrick Lamar and Drake symbolizes deeper cultural conversations within the genre. Reignited by Kendrick’s recent track “Euphoria,” the conflict reflects not just a battle over lyrical prowess but also a broader dispute over integrity and representation in the music industry. Kendrick’s pointed lyrics are part of a broader call for authenticity, challenging superficial engagement with Black culture and rightfully so.
However, Kendrick now faces accusations of colorism. Critics suggest Kendrick’s critique implies Drake, as a biracial artist and half-white artist, cannot claim this culturally significant term and, therefore, has no right to say it. However, Kendrick’s comments focus on Drake’s perceived inauthenticity within Black culture, underscoring deeper issues of cultural stewardship rather than simplistic questions of racial purity.
Kendrick Lamar, known for his introspective and socially conscious lyricism, emerged from Compton’s rap scene and gained recognition with his early mixtapes and debut album, “good kid, m.A.A.d city.” His nuanced storytelling and engagement with political issues earned him critical acclaim, solidifying his reputation as the modern king of Hip Hop and a lyrical boogeyman to other rappers.
Drake, a privileged upper-class Toronto native and former child actor, transitioned from television to music with his 2009 mixtape “So Far Gone.” Blending rap and R&B, he cultivated a unique style marked by introspective lyrics, emotional vulnerability and commercial success, making him one of the most profitable artists in Hip Hop today. His persona now centers heavily around his “street cred” and occasionally steps into the space of representing a gangsta or hood status.
Colorism, for clarity, is a form of discrimination based on skin tone that has roots in colonialism and slavery, which embedded hierarchies within Black communities based on proximity to whiteness. Enslaved people with lighter skin often received preferential treatment, leading to entrenched divisions and biases. 
In modern times, colorism persists in media representation, employment and beauty standards, where lighter-skinned individuals frequently receive more positive portrayals or are deemed less Black, as if Blackness was based on skin tone. These historical complexities continue to influence societal dynamics and identity perceptions, creating internal challenges around belonging and acceptance within the Black community.
Kendrick Lamar’s critique of Drake is now being heavily misunderstood, even by some Black commentators, as rooted in colorism or racial purity. However, Kendrick’s challenge is centered on the way Drake has historically engaged with Black culture. Kendrick, who grew up in Compton, one of the most hood communities in America, witnessed firsthand the struggles Drake often portrays inauthentically while making boatloads of money misrepresenting the struggle. Moments that make this cosplay of Blackness clear are Drake’s previous remarks disparaging Toronto’s Black locals’ use of Black vernacular as “ignorant” at one of his fancy dinners.
These early actions reveal a lack of genuine connection to Black culture, providing crucial context to understanding Kendrick’s critique.
Furthermore, Drake has made light of Black American experiences like slavery in his lyrics to craft clever battle bars against Kendrick, a move that trivializes profound historical suffering for the sake of lyrical competitiveness. This behavior exemplifies a pattern of engaging with Black culture superficially, using its elements when convenient or beneficial for his image, yet failing to stand up for the culture or genuinely advocate for its deeper issues.
Kendrick’s critique, therefore, is not just about Drake’s racial identity but his perceived inauthenticity and opportunistic approach to Black culture. By highlighting these points, Kendrick is calling Drake out for cosplaying Blackness only when it’s reputationally and economically beneficial which leaves a very similar taste in my mouth as white rappers like Post Malone. All this while never stepping up for #BlackLives in any real way during his career.
Cultural gatekeeping is essential for preserving authenticity and ensuring that practices are not distorted or exploited for personal gain. Within Black culture, this means protecting the use of language, traditions and historical experiences that shape the collective identity. By defining and maintaining cultural boundaries, the community can counter appropriation and uphold the integrity of practices that have been historically marginalized. Gatekeeping reinforces the value of lived experiences and prevents superficial engagement that can distort or disrespect the culture’s significance.
Appropriation and superficial adoption of Black culture often manifest in the realms of language, fashion and music, diluting the authenticity and significance of these cultural expressions. Artists who use Black vernacular without a deep connection to the Black experience diminish the meaning of these expressions. In fashion, trends like sporting cornrows or durags without understanding their cultural and historical context can trivialize the discrimination Black individuals often face for wearing them. Similarly, musicians incorporating elements of Hip Hop into their tracks without acknowledging the genre’s origins or the socio-economic struggles behind its creation contribute to a landscape where the aesthetics of Black culture are celebrated, but the underlying issues are ignored. 
Kendrick Lamar’s critique of Drake is a direct manifestation of the growing awareness within Black communities regarding the importance of cultural fidelity. Lamar’s pointed commentary reflects a shift toward rejecting superficial cultural engagement and reinforcing the need for genuine stewardship. Black communities are increasingly vocal in defending the authenticity of their cultural practices, challenging artists who seem to exploit Black culture for commercial gain while lacking true advocacy or understanding of the historical and social struggles embedded within the culture. Kendrick’s critique resonates as part of this larger movement toward asserting cultural fidelity and protecting the integrity of Black artistic expressions.
Kendrick Lamar’s critique of Drake must be understood beyond simplistic labels like “colorism.” The issue isn’t about racial purity but about Drake’s superficial use of Blackness. To protect Black cultural expressions from exploitation and appropriation, it is vital to advocate for ongoing dialogue fostering deeper understanding and genuine respect for the struggles, history and artistry shaping Black cultural practices. If you hear someone parroting this colorism trope, please correct them and share with them this piece. 
Kendrick’s critique stands as a call to action for a more nuanced conversation about authenticity within Hip Hop. His stance invites us to confront and dismantle superficial appropriations while advocating for authentic stewardship. In a landscape increasingly dominated by the commodification of culture, not even a Black man like Drake is off the hook. In fact, due to his commercial success, he is more on the hook than any of us, and he better recognize that quickly. None of this is looking good for him, and he’d be wise to take a step back and have a seat.
