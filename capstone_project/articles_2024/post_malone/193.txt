Riley Green and Post Malone gave a whole new meaning to the phrase "star bar" when they popped up at Loser's Bar & Grill in downtown Nashville recently.
The two singers didn't appear to have any scheduled reason to be at the venue, and the fans that took snapshots and videos of them didn't appear to have had any idea that they were planning to show up at Loser's.
They weren't there for the reason you'd expect, either: Rather than hop on stage and sing, Malone and Green threw on aprons and jumped behind the bar, slinging drinks for some star-struck patrons during their time there.
One fan said that Posty made screwdrivers for her and her friends, and Green grabbed her phone and took a group selfie with the Loser's patrons.
Another fan said she was there for a bachelorette party when her group spotted Green and Malone behind the bar. She shared some video snippets and a couple of photos from the night-out surprise, including snapshots of Malone and Green chumming it up as they made patrons drinks.
Green has made a few surprise appearances at Loser's over the years. The establishment is attached to Green's own Duck Blind bar, which took the place of Winners Bar & Grill earlier this year.
