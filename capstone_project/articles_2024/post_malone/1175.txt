Quavo was previously spotted in Italy, where a fan seemingly approached the rapper and showed off a massive tattoo in tribute to the Atlanta rapper and 1/3 of Migos. 
The fan was seen taking his shirt off to show the rapper, turning his back and revealing the art. The tattoo also included a massive portrait of Post Malone alongside Quavo. Previously, Quavo encountered a fan in Japan who had a t-shirt featuring his nephew Takeoff, which caused the rapper to pay for the shirt directly off of the man's back.
