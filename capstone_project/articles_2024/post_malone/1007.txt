Shaboozey’s crossover hit, “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” has reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for its fourth total week. The single became Shaboozey’s first career chart-topper when it reached No. 1 four weeks earlier. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” also reached No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart this week, while also becoming just the third song ever to top the Billboard Hot 100 and the Country Airplay chart simultaneously. The rest of the Top 5 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart are filled out by Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, which stays at No. 2, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” remains at No. 3, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” moves up a spot to No. 4, and Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” drops a slot to No. 5.
