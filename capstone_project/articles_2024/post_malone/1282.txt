In a post shared by Tikerah Malone on Facebook, the animal is seen stopping, letting out a sound, before going back to walking down the street.
It is unclear who's goat this may be or how it found its way into Harrisburg, but Find Toby PA does have a post asking for the public's help in tracking down the mysterious visitor.
