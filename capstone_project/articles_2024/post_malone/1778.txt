Be careful what you are saying to people in the crowd when you show up at a Jordan Davis concert, because the person you are talking to could be him.
At least that is what happened before Davis was set to headline a billing with Mitchell Tenpenny and Ashley Cooke opening up for him.
Davis, sporting just sunglasses and a hat and seated in the stands among fans, hit up concert-goers with comments like, "I'm only here for Tenpenny, the headliner is garbage" and "My girlfriend dragged me here, I don't like the headliner."
Most fans just played along, being nice until others started taking a closer look at who they were talking to.
The best part is the second-guessing of the fans who are almost sure that he is Jordan Davis, but have to check their phones first.
Many other artists have applauded Jordan for his bravado in trying this.
Hardy writes: "Balls of steel. I can't do this lol."
While Mitchell Tenpenny, who is the true star of the show, according to Davis, adds: "Hahahahaha dude how in the hell do you do this bro??? I’m way too scared. Incredible content. Love you bro best Headliner in the game."
Have to give Davis some huge props here, as you can imagine how this could have gone wrong if he had found a sympathetic 'Davis-hater' who would have piled on.
Thankfully, everyone seemed to push back on his claims of not liking Jordan Davis.
