Jelly Roll spoke with ET about his upcoming hosting gig.
"I'm excited to bring energy to the table," he said. "I think me and Ashley are gonna bring a lot of fun, a lot of funny, but also a lot of honesty, right. We're really friends and we're here with our peers and I think you're gonna see that and feel that in a way. You've never felt it when we're out there. I think you're gonna understand how tight the country music community is this year."
