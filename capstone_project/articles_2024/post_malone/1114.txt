The 2024 NFL season is ready to launch, with the world champion Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday, September 5. Expect many music fans — and now gamblers — to have their eyeballs on the VIP boxes instead of the field.
That is because BetKansas.com is offering odds on whether or not Taylor Swift will be in the stands for the season opener. Now, the long odds (-2700) reflect the idea that just about everyone believes she will attend, but if you think that the pop star will skip the game, you could be cashing in big (+2700).
The Swift bet is just a small sample of the many ways you could cash in on NFL opening week. The Kansas City Chiefs are once again favorites to repeat as NFL champions according to FanDuel, with +550 odds.
Right behind them is the NFC champions of 2023, the San Francisco 49ers, at +600. Behind the top two find the Ravens (+1100) and the Detroit Lions.
The Lions have rapidly become one of the NFL's tougher teams, and Las Vegas has taken notice, placing the odds at +1200, just in front of the Philadelphia Eagles at +1200.
Gambling has become more mainstream in the past few years as multiple states relax regulations on sports betting. The 2023 Super Bowl saw a record 23.1 billion dollars wagered on that game alone, with a record 68 million people placing at least one bet on the big game.
Good luck to you, no matter what you are betting on!
