On August 21, 2018,¬†a plane carrying the popular singer circled the Hudson Valley as it prepared to make an emergency landing with two blown-out tires. Two tires blew off during takeoff when a plane with 16 passengers, including Malone, left from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey heading to London.
The FAA told the plane to hoover around Stewart International Airport in New Windsor to burn off fuel, before landing. The plane landed safely.
After the near-death experience, Malone and his crew reportedly visited Joe's Pizzeria on South Plank Road.
The group feasted on a dozen mango-habanero wings, another dozen garlic-parmesan wings, and two Italian combo sandwiches,¬†while at the Newburgh pizza shop. They also ordered six pies.¬†One of them was a meat lover's pie, another was pepperoni and the rest were plain.
