It can be hard plucking up the courage booking an appointment to change your look.
Whether it's picking a new set of specs or finally deciding to change your hairstyle, it's all overwhelming. Now one bloke decided to jump out of his comfort zone with an incredible transformation.
In a post on TikTok, Richmond Barber who has over 1.3million followers, recently shared a client who popped into his store for a trim. His caption read: "My man's had the same haircut for nearly 20 years so we had to bless him with a mid/low taper.
The caption further mused: "A burst fade could have been cool too but we kept it simple and clean."
The post swiftly racked up an impressive 85,000 likes and scores of comments, as countless viewers praised the mans new look. It starts with the barber inquiring about the duration his client has maintained the same hairstyle, to which he responds around 20 years.
Then the customer disclosed his history of visiting various barbers late in the day without booking ahead, leading to subpar service due to the imminent closing time.
Consequently, the chap essentially gave up on getting haircuts and opted to retain his old style, frequently wearing a hat to cover it up due to feeling self-conscious.
Following a lengthy 90-minute drive to meet Richmond Barber, the customer claimed he was long due for a makeover. Moments later, the hairdresser sprang into action, yielding a result that was nothing short of astonishing.
The client was left feeling "insane" by the haircut, praising the barber by saying: "You do incredible work." When questioned whether the lengthy commute was worth it, he responded with a resounding: "Absolutely."
The transformation sparked a flurry of comments, with one observer noting: "That's a different man." Another commentator added: "Bro confidence came right back... looks like a different person."
A third chimed in: "Post Malone makeover, let's go." And a fourth enthusiastic commenter gushed: "Dude looks so good."
