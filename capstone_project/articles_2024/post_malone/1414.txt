Like any country artist out there, Jelly Roll has spent quite a bit of time on the road, so it's safe to say he's a bit of an expert when it comes to staying in hotels. This is likely why Hotels.com enlisted the singer for their latest campaign "Perfect 10."
The "Halfway to Hell" hitmaker is not a fan of how early hotels make you checkout of your room. For those who feel the same, Jelly Roll has a tip for getting a late checkout that has never let him down.
"I feel like we're giving away some serious game right here," he divulges in the clip.
"If you ever come into the hotel late at night and the late night desk person is there," he explains. "That's the person to ask for the late checkout. I'm telling you. They'll put it in right then.
"It's never failed."
Jelly Roll didn't specify how late the late night has to be, but he's been known to head out for an afterparty or two after various events such asÂ award shows. Like the epic beer pong tournament with Kane Brown, Jason Aldean and Post Malone after the 2024 ACM Awards.
On Aug. 27, the "I Am Not Okay" singer will embark on his biggest tour yet. The Beautifully Broken Tour is his first arena tour and he's bringing Warren Zeiders and Alexandra Kay along for the ride.
He even shared the setlist via an Apple Music playlist.
"This is the biggest tour of my life y'all and I'm going to do it really really big this year," the singer said when he announced the trek. "I can't wait to see y'all at a show. Come party with us!"
