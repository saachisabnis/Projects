	Written by ACM songwriter of the year winner Jessie Jo Dillon alongside Josh Miller, Daniel Ross and two-time Grammy winner Chris Tompkins, with production from Joey Moi, the ballad was originally recorded at London’s Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios in December 2023, just following his sold-out O2 London show on Dec. 3. The recording of “Lies Lies Lies” was part of his seven-song Abbey Road Sessions, with the digital series releasing on March 3, 2024. The release also commemorated the one-year anniversary of Wallen’s third studio album One Thing at a Time.

	“Playing the O2 in London last fall and getting to record at Abbey Road, where so much iconic music has been made, was legendary for me and my band. We will never forget it,” 11-time 2023 Billboard Music Awards winner said in a statement when the Abbey Road Sessions project was released. “I’m so excited to release these Abbey Road Sessions for my fans on the one-year anniversary of One Thing At A Time. They make all this possible.”
