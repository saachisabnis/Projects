Taylor Swift has revealed the tracklist for her upcoming album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” out April 19.

	“Okay, this is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number. I don’t know if I’ve ever told you that,” Swift joked at the top of her speech. She went on to thank fans, and in return, said she would reward them “by telling you a secret that I have been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19th.”
