Morgan Wallen is slated to release his highly-anticipated song, “Lies Lies Lies,” on Friday (July 5), but iHeartCountry listeners can catch it one day early.
On Thursday (July 4), iHeartCountry stations will spotlight Wallen’s “Lies Lies Lies,” a song the country star recorded at the iconic Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios in London on December 5, 2023. That recording followed the East Tennessee-born artist’s sold-out show at the O2 two days prior. “Lies Lies Lies” was written by Jessie Jo Dillon, Josh Miller, Daniel Ross, and Chris Tompkins, and produced by Joey Moi, per a press release from Wallen’s record label. The release notes that the song “depicts the narrator's attempt to convince a past love that he's moved on in one breath, before admittedly deeming them all ‘lies’ and caving into his true feelings.”
Wallen previously included “Lies Lies Lies” on Abbey Road Sessions, a 7-track collection of songs recorded at Abbey Road Studios and arrived as a surprise to fans on the one-year anniversary of One Thing At A Time. Wallen recorded new versions of some of the songs that appeared on the 36-track album in March 2023, along with two unreleased ones: “Lies Lies Lies,” and his cover of “Graveyard Whistling” by Nothing But Thieves.
Wallen is set to take the stage during his first-ever headlining show at BST Hyde Park London on the Fourth of July. The lineup also includes Riley Green, ERNEST, Ella Langley, Alana Sprinsteen, Zandi Holup and others.
“Lies Lies Lies” follows “I Had Some Help,” Wallen’s hit single with Post Malone. It’s one of 18 tracks appearing on Posty’s upcoming country album, F-1 Trillion, in August. Wallen’s latest full-length record is One Thing At A Time. Find his music on iHeartRadio here.
