After dropping to No. 2 on last week’s Billboard Hot 100, Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s country collaboration, “I Had Some Help,” returned to the No. 1 slot on this week’s chart. The hit single has now spent six total weeks on top of the Hot 100 chart, the only song to notch six weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 2024. “I Had Some Help” also reached No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart, achieving the rare combination of topping the all-format airplay tally as well as the Country Airplay survey. Elsewhere in the Top 5, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” rises to a new high on the chart by moving up to No. 2, while Kendrick Lamar’s past No. 1 hit, “Not Like Us,” climbs up to No. 3. Sabrina Carpenter places two songs in the Top 5 once again, as “Please Please Please” falls to No. 5 a week after hitting No. 1, and “Espresso” remains at No. 4. (Billboard)
