The process has expanded over the years; now there are fifteen different categories of "sexiness," and several country musicians are on the ballot. Think you know who they are? We're betting you probably don't. For example, in the category "Sexiest Musician," two of the four are country stars: Zach Bryan and Shaboozey. Under "Sexiest Long-Married Star (25+ Years), Tim McGraw is one of your four options. And for "Who's got the sexiest tattoos," Post Malone is the sole country representative. Take part in the democratic process and cast your vote, do it soon because the voting closes tomorrow.
