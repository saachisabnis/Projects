An icon is returning to the stage in both Philly and New Jersey in 2024. Here's what we know so far about Jennifer Lopez' This is Me... Now Tour and when it'll be in our area.
In 2002, Jennifer Lopez released her third studio album. She was a woman in love. With Ben Affleck.
The whole album is a love letter to the actor, quite literally, including a song called 'Dear Ben'. It didn't work out. They got engaged but split before they could say, 'I do.' But Jennifer did. She wed Marc Anthony, had twins, divorced him, got engaged to Alex Rodriguez, and unengaged.
It's 2024 and it feels like Groundhog's Day. In 2022, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rekindled their romance and FINALLY made it to the altar. When you fall in love with an old flame that inspired one album, you make its sequel. And that's exactly what JLO has done.
Not only does the album This is Me... Now reflect where Jen is in her life presently, but so does its accompanying short film. Lopez is visually working through and recognizing her reputation as being a serial lover. Think she doesn't know or care how the world perceives her love life? Think again. What it on Amazon Prime and you'll see for yourself.
Oh, and YES, there's a 'Dear Ben: Part 2' on This is Me... Now.
Recently, Jennifer Lopez has been rumored to be retiring from making music and touring, which makes her 2024 tour all the more relevant.
It will bring the superstar to the Philly and New Jersey area in August.
On August 10th, JLO will perform at the Prudential Center in Newark. NJ. On August 13th, Lopez will take the stage at Philadelphia, PA's Wells Fargo Center.
