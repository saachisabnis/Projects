Who doesn't like to laugh? Squares... that's who.
Famous comedian and podcaster Theo Von is, or was depending on when you're reading this article, performing at Adams Center on the campus of the University of Montana this weekend. Von is a solid performer to get in Missoula. His podcast This Past Weekend With Theo Von has featured some very popular guests - Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Post Malone, Mark Cuban, Brooks & Dunn and more.
Von is on his Return of the Rat Tour doing stand-up all over the country. It got me thinking about other comedians I want to see in Missoula. Here are the 5 I want to see and for you music fans, you can find 49 bands that should come to Missoula at the bottom of the article.
My favorite bald comedian Bill Burr needs to do a show in Missoula. That being said, he might be too big for Zoo Town considering he has sold out Red Rocks Amphitheatre multiple times. But gall dang Bill Burr is a funny, funny dude.
Half of you read 'Dave Chappelle' and thought "Hell yes, come to Missoula." The other half said 'Oh this jerk? No thanks." Chappelle is a legend and I can take the offensive content. Come to Missoula, my friend.

This is my all-time favorite comedian. Bo Burnham's stand-ups are more theatrics than the other entries on this list, and he's more known for his produced special Inside on Netflix during the pandemic. Regardless, Burnham is at the top of my list.
I said Burr is my favorite bald comedian, but I might have to walk back on that statement. Tom Segura is up there. We'll call it a tie for favorite baldies.
Talk about offensive stand-up performers. Jim Jefferies will roast a whole lot of people. Specifically, religion so be warned if you give him a watch.
