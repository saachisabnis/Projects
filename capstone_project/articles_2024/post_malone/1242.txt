What do Henry Cavill, Mila Kunis, and Fred Durst have in common? Hint: It has nothing to do with their acting or singing but has everything to do with video games. If you’re just as into epic online battles as they are, you need to check out this deal.
You can get three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 21% off! We’re even letting you stack up to five codes at once for 15 months of discounted play.
What’s inside? More than 500 games you can play on your console, PC, tablet, or smartphone! Some recent releases include Starfield, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, and Minecraft Legends. You’ll be glued to gaming more than Wade Watts from Ready Player One!
You’ll also be the first to play day-one releases! Imagine when GTA VI finally comes out — you can play it instantly without having to run to the store for a physical copy. Post Malone, Terry Crews, and other video game-obsessed celebs are going to be so jealous of you!
