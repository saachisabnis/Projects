Every Bonnaroo I’ve been to has a defining trait attached to it in my memory.  Sometimes it’s a person, sometimes it’s a band, but this year it was the heat.  MY GOD, the heat.  2007 was even worse because there was a drought but this year comes in a close second. 
That’s what’s counter-intuitive about Bonnaroo.  It simultaneously encourages you to walk miles on a baking, dusty pasture, but your better angels (if they’re around that day) will remind you that you need to take care of yourself.
						
						If a hot Bonnaroo were to have a mantra, it would be “everything in moderation.”  And I do mean, everything.  You’ve got to keep yourself hydrated and cool, you’ve got to keep out of the sun as much as possible and you’ve got to pace yourself.  You’ve got to remember that certain substances one can find there and alcohol don’t always mix well with the heat. 
One of my favorite things about Bonnaroo is the incredibly random variety of people you meet there.  In normal life, you don’t go around saying hello to everyone, asking where they’re from and what they do, but at Bonnaroo that’s perfectly acceptable behavior, along with “High-five Friday” and saying “Happy Bonnaroo” to anyone and everyone.
						
						Bonnaroo 2024 was one of the most fun Bonnaroo’s I’ve been to in part because we were camped next to a great group of people (“We’re with Cage the Elephant”), a tight-knit group with roots in Bowling Green Kentucky, which also happens to be the birthplace of Cage the Elephant. 
						
						“Cage” was founded in 2006 by a group of 5 high-school friends including brothers Matt and Brad Shultz.  Matt is the singer and Brad is the rhythm guitarist.  Brad showed up on Friday night and we spent a lot of the weekend either hanging out with them or following them around.
						
						Cage is currently touring with 44 dates left in support of their most recent studio album “Neon Pill.” 
						
						Since their formation in 2006 they’ve put out a new album about every two years but according to Brad, Covid put a kink in their album production and this 5-year gap between Neon Pill and their last album “Social Cues” in 2019 is the longest yet.
						
						The band won a Grammy for their album “Tell me I’m Pretty” and Brad is known as a writer, record producer and the rhythm guitarist of Cage the Elephant.
						
						Until this year, I had never seen them but they allowed photographers to shoot their entire show at Bonnaroo which is unusual but was a welcome break in the routine and made for an ecstatic introduction to the band and their music. 
						
						This had the side effect of allowing me to both shoot the show and enjoy the music and the performance. As introductions go, I think this is the best I could have hoped for and I now count myself a fan.  I tried to come up with comparisons and the one that resonated with me most was that they remind me a bit of Oasis.
						
						The heat was brutal the entire weekend and apparently the sun doesn’t care how late you stayed up.  On Saturday morning, I was up all night in the media campground and the sun was peeking over the horizon when I finally fell asleep but two hours later when the sun hit the top of my van, sleeping was over.  Without AC, any tent or vehicle at Bonnaroo becomes a convection oven.
						
						From Wednesday, June 12th to Sunday, June 16th, festival-goers were treated to an incredible lineup of headliners including Pretty Lights, Post Malone, Cage the Elephant, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fred Again, Megan Thee Stallion and Jason Isbell with 400 Unit along with a host of other, lesser-known artists, each seemingly with their own rabid following.
						
						Pretty Lights kicked off the festival on Thursday and lit up the stage with their electrifying performance and the crowd loved it. Their unique blend of electronic and hip-hop music was a great way to kick off five days of musical indulgence.
Post Malone took the stage on Friday and brought his signature blend of hip-hop and pop-rock to the Bonnaroo crowd. He played a long, 17-song set with a 4-song encore and brought out Billy Strings to join him for “Rockstar” and “Stay.”
						
						The big stage Saturday evening belonged first to Cage the Elephant and then the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Cage delivered an unforgettable performance that had the crowd jumping and dancing from start to finish. Their high-energy set was a highlight of the festival.
						
						The Red Hot Chili Peppers brought their legendary funk-rock sound late Saturday to the What stage where they played a long set in the sweltering heat with a lot of off-script jamming and pulled out some of their lesser-known songs.
Sunday brought Fred Again, Megan Thee Stallion, and Jason Isbell with 400 Unit closing out the festival in style.
						
						Bonnaroo is about more than just the headliners and the festival also featured a great lineup of up-and-coming artists.  One artist, Chappell Roan had to be moved to a bigger stage, because she blew up on social media since the lineup was first announced. 
Other artists of note were Gary Clark Jr, Teezo Touchdown, Maggie Rogers, Carly Rae Jepsen, Interpol, Yves Tumor, Parcels, who put on a crazy jam set in one of the tents, and The Mars Volta.
						
						No festival experience would be complete without camping out under the stars, and Bonnaroo delivered on that front as well. The sprawling campgrounds were alive with impromptu jam sessions, late-night dance parties, and plenty of opportunities to make new friends.
						
						Bonnaroo has been stretching itself, rebranding the camp area as “Outeroo” which now has its own stages and locations for hanging out.  They now sell early arrival tickets for Tuesday and Wednesday, and although Centeroo is closed then, it allows people to come early, set up camp, and hang around and meet people before the rush.
						
						As the sun set on Sunday evening and the final notes faded, as always there was a collective sense of bittersweet satisfaction. Without fail, I always find myself thinking on Friday night “I’ve got 2 more days.”  Then, in a snap of a finger, it’s over, and Sunday night is here and it goes by in a flash!
						
						This was my 12th Bonnaroo and I’ve had the pleasure and the privilege of watching it evolve through the years.  I’ve watched it grow in popularity.  I’ve seen the good and the bad that can happen there, and as I’ve said many times before Bonnaroo, (like most of life) is what you make of it.  You manifest your own Bonnaroo.  You choose whether it’s a good time or a slog in the heat and dirt and that’s Bonnaroo’s greatest lesson of all.
						
						See you next year, Bonnaroo!
