After settling for #2 for his previous two releases, Post Malone is headed back to #1 on the Billboard 200.
According to Hits Daily Double, the artist’s new country effort “F-1 Trillion” will start with 200-225K total US units. The figure, which consists of combined activity from album sales, track sales, and track streams, should be enough for a comfortable #1 debut.
The figure, moreover, roughly doubles the 113K achieved by previous album “Austin.”
The Hits projection calls for 60-70K in traditional album sales for “F-1 Trillion,” a figure that also doubles the predecessor’s mark (34K).
