Home » Post Malone And Dwight Yoakam Spotted On Horseback In Hollywood
Post Malone and Dwight Yoakam were seen horsing around together in Hollywood recently. Malone was apparently shooting a music video for an as-yet-unreleased music collaboration with the country legend, as the duo were filmed riding on horseback while casually cruising past The Roxy on Sunset Boulevard. Posty is clearly still riding high – figuratively and literally – from his new album, F-1 Trillion, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart last week, the second-largest release week for a country record this year. The video shoot also apparently featured stars like actresses Malin Akerman and Nina Dobrev along with her Olympic gold medal-winning boyfriend Shaun White, who all joined in the Hollywood honkytonk on set. Malone and Yoakam have a history of collaborating in the City of Angels, as Posty joined Dwight during his show back in July at Los Angeles’ historic Greek Theatre. The duo performed a pair of Yoakam classics that night for the lucky fans in attendance, “Guitars & Cadillacs” and “Fast as You.” (Holler)
