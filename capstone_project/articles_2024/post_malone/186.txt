It has been a whirlwind couple of days for Taylor Swift and her fans as the now 14-time Grammy winner not only announced a brand new album, but now the track list as well. The Tortured Poets Department will release on April 19, 2024, and it will have 16 tracks plus one bonus song.

This will be Swift's 11th studio album, and the first new album (not including re-records) since Midnights, which won Album of the Year at the 2024 Grammys. The announcement of The Tortured Poets Department was a complete surprise, and now there's even more information to dig into and digest for the next couple months.
Here are some things that stood out from the list of songs.
Two tracks -- Fortnight and Florida!!! -- feature guest artist with Post Malone joining for the former and Florence + the Machine on the latter. Swift has collaborated frequently on her albums, but this will be an exciting collaboration for fans.
These track titles are certain to cause us all to melt into a complete puddle. "My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys" is the early frontrunner to rip my heart out, closely followed by "Down Bad" and "I Can Do It With a Broken Heart."
I am, however, very ready to listen to "The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived."
