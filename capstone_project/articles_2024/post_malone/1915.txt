Morgan Wallen and ERNEST just hit some pretty noteworthy career milestones.
The two country artists currently have the highest-charting country song at the moment with the collaborative effort “Cowgirls”. The hit has also made history with a new record broken for both Morgan Wallen and ERNEST.
According to reports from US Radio Updater, the song just hit the no. 1 spot on the Billboard Country Airplay chart as well as the Mediabase Country Airplay chart. This would be the first ever no. 1 single for ERNEST as an artist (i.e. not as a writer) as well as Wallen’s 14th no. 1 hit of his career on the Billboard chart and 15th on the Mediabase chart, respectively.
“Cowgirls” now boasts the most one-week spins on the Mediabase US Country Radio chart with nearly 10,000 spins.
Along with these stellar records, Wallen is now one of only two artists in the history of Billboard to replace themselves at the no. 1 spot. “Cowgirls” has replaced “I Had Some Help”, a duet with Post Malone. Tim McGraw is the only other country artist to do this, notably with his song “Bring On The Rain” replacing his hit “The Cowboy In Me”.
ERNEST recently commented on the success of the song in an Instagram post celebrating the record-breaking win.
“Lucky,” the Nashville-born singer wrote. “11th number 1 as a writer and 1st number 1 as an artist. I wouldn’t have a hand full of em if it weren’t for [Morgan Wallen] cutting em or having me on to sing this one with it him too. Thanks country music radio and the radio team for always grinding 🦅 long live em’.”

Fans took to the Instagram to congratulate the 32-year-old singer.
“Luck always plays a part in life, but Morgan has been singing your songs because they are amazing and he enjoys fleshing out all the sentiments, and because you are a d**n good friend,” said one fan.
“Cowgirls” is one of a few record-breaking songs on Morgan Wallen’s recent album One Thing At A Time. The song was a co-writing effort between Wallen, ERNEST, Rocky Block, Ashley Gorley, James Maddox, and Charlie Handsome.
