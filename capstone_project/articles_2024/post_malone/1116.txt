	In May 2019, Morgan Wallen’s initial No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, “Whiskey Glasses,” began a two-week command.

	“My first No. 1 on Hot Country Songs happened on my 26th birthday,” Wallen told Billboard upon learning of the achievement that May 13. “This is truly a day I’ll never forget.”

	The track, which was written by Ben Burgess and Kevin Kadish and produced by Joey Moi, followed Wallen’s first Hot Country Songs top 10, “Up Down” (featuring Florida Georgia Line), which reached No. 5 in June 2018.

	For Wallen, 31, from Sneedville, Tenn., “Whiskey Glasses” marked his first of seven Hot Country Songs chart-toppers to date, among 25 top 10s. On Country Airplay, he has scored 12 leaders; “Up Down” became his first No. 1 on the radio ranking, and “Whiskey Glasses,” his second, for three weeks starting in June 2019.

	The track was initially released on Wallen’s rookie EP, The Way I Talk. It’s also on his breakthrough full-length, 2018’s If I Know Me, which in August 2020 became his first of three No. 1s on Top Country Albums.

Dangerous: The Double Album followed, ruling Top Country Albums for a record 97 weeks beginning in January 2021. One Thing at a Time arrived in 2023 and has reigned for 48 weeks, while topping the all-genre Billboard 200 for 19 weeks – the most ever for a country title.

	Wallen is featured on Post Malone’s new single, “I Had Some Help,” which is set to storm the May 25-dated Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.
