CHARLOTTE, N.C. (QUEEN CITY NEWS) – The Avett Brothers and DaBaby will round out the field for Charlotte’s spring Lovin’ Life Music Festival, organizers announced Friday.
The Avett Brothers, from Concord, join an already healthy lineup of musicians that includes The Chainsmokers, Charlotte’s own DaBaby, Post Malone, Noah Kahan, and the legendary Stevie Nicks. Greenville’s Petey Pablo is also on the roster.
“The city’s amazing reception to its first true multi-genre major music festival is exactly what we had hoped,” co-founder of Southern Entertainment Bob Durkin said. “Sales at all levels are strong, with some already sold out, and sponsors are lining up to support this initiative, solidifying Charlotte’s position as a Music City.”
Some of the other artists announced Friday include The Fray, Dashboard Confessional, Dash Sanders, and Young the Giant.
The festival takes place May 3-5 in Uptown and will feature multiple stages. Tickets have already gone on sale.
