K. Dot led the way for Hip Hop at the four-day festival, and joining him on the bill were his cousin Baby Keem, Lil Nas X, Three 6 Mafia, J.I.D., Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, Yung Gravy, and more. The pgLang rapper took the stage on day two.
And back in 2008, Kanye West made headlines when he, too, hit the Bonnaroo stage, but not for the right reasons.

The show was delayed two hours, much to the dismay of fans. Kanye was scheduled to hit the stage at 2:45 AM on Sunday morning but did not manage to start his show until about 4:25 AM – by which time, most fans had fallen asleep.
Chants of “Kanye sucks!” were heard throughout the venue, as fans threw glow-in-the-dark sticks at the empty stage, according to the BBC, who were in attendance for the festival. Later that day, guitarist Robert Randolph encouraged more “Kanye sucks” chants from the crowd.

The cause of the delay was a combination of difficulties with taking down Pearl Jam’s set (the band played an hour late), as well as difficulties in setting up Kanye’s elaborate stage.
Other acts at Bonnaroo that year included Chris Rock, Jack Johnson, Metallica, M.I.A., Talib Kweli, and Lupe Fiasco.
