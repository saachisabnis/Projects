Beyoncé is fully in her country era and she isn’t releasing the reigns anytime soon it seems.
Up next for the 32-time Grammy Award winning artist is the upcoming documentary, Call Me Country: Beyoncé & Nashville’s Renaissance.  Produced by CNN FlashDocs, the project will “provide a look at the impact of high-profile acts like Beyoncé and Lil Nas X on the contemporary country music scene and how their contributions connect to the history of Black artists in Nashville,” according to a press release.
Within the documentary, viewers will also see and hear the thoughts of a number of country music experts including the co-directors of the Black Opry, Holly G. and Tanner D, as well as renowned artists in the genre such as Aaron Vance, the Brothers Osborne, Denitia, Rissi Palmer, and Rhiannon Giddens, who also played banjo on the hit, “Texas Hold ‘Em.”
The documentary of course comes on the heels of the Houston native’s chart topping album, Cowboy Carter, which was released on March 29 and features an impressive list of collaborators such as Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Pharrell Williams, Raphael Saadiq, Post Malone, Stevie Wonder, and 6-year-old daughter, Rumi Carter.
Queen Bey’s foray into the heartland has proven to be yet another record-breaking project in her catalog having earned her the title as the first black woman to top both Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart with “Texas Hold ‘Em” and hit number one on the Top Country Album chart as well.
Cowboy Carter is currently sitting atop the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart for the second consecutive week.
Call Me Country: Beyoncé & Nashville’s Renaissance will debut on Max on April 26.
