Fall camp has started for Michigan Football, but it's still a little early to do a Fall Football Bits. Seth continues to roll out his recruiting profiles for the incoming 2024 class and as I have been reading through them, I had an idea for a piece to fill content gaps until preseason content really begins: ranking the Jim Harbaugh Era Michigan recruiting classes. "What about recruiting rankings?" you may say, but I'm talking about after the fact rankings. The real rankings, based on how the players actually performed and the value they gave to Michigan, not the speculative projections when they weren't old enough to legally drink in Canada. 
So, I set out to rank them. 2022-2024 are excluded because they are obviously too close to the present to be fairly assessed, though I will give some commentary on those at the end of this piece (2022 especially, which looks monster). I am including the 2015 partial class that Hoke started and JH finished, acknowledging that its small volume and unfortunate circumstances limited its ranking. These rankings are being graded based on the value that the players in the class provided Michigan, weighted towards superstars rather than volume of contributors, though certainly the more contributors the better. Obviously it's good if a class had few misses, but two or three Devin Gils don't equal one Aidan Hutchinson is what I'm saying. With the criteria out of the way, let's get started: 
Biggest contributors: Jon Runyan Jr., Karan Higdon, Zach Gentry, Tyree Kinnel 
Explanation: This was always going to be the lowest ranked class on the list for the reasons I briefly mentioned in the opening. It was mostly recruited during the backdrop of the crumbling Hoke era, then briefly finished by Harbaugh, mostly too late to make his mark. They signed only 14 players, the highest rated of which was Brian Cole, the only top 200 player Michigan signed. The athletic Cole didn't work out in Ann Arbor, but this class didn't have too many outright misses... it just didn't have many good bets to begin with. Again, the circumstances tell the story. 
There were some decent players here, though! Jon Runyan Jr. had a remarkable glow-up arc and became an All-B1G left tackle who has had a fruitful NFL career. Karan Higdon was a solid starting running back on some good teams. Zach Gentry was also All-B1G at TE after moving from QB and got himself drafted (still bouncing around the league). Tyree Kinnel was a starter and Grant Newsome was briefly one at tackle before The Injury. Grant Perry also had some moments but that's the end of the contributor list, some decent players but no real superstar and a small volume overall. Pretty obviously the worst on the list, but it was always going to be. 
[AFTER THE JUMP: much better classes]

Biggest Contributors: Nico Collins, Cesar Ruiz, Kwity Paye, Ambry Thomas, Brad Robbins, Brad Hawkins, Donovan Peoples-Jones 
Explanation: Tossing a bone to Craig Ross and all the other anti-recruiting rankings people, the 2017 class that 247 and other sites deemed as Michigan's best (in terms of national ranking) in the Harbaugh era turned out to be the worst among the full classes that he recruited. It was a big class, as JH was still trying to rebuild the depth chart after the Hoke era by signing 30 players. It was lauded by star-gazers, pegged 5th in the national rankings, but failed to deliver that value to Michigan, with far too many whiffs and not enough of the hits turning into stars.
The issues for the class started at the key offensive positions. Dylan McCaffrey (QB) did not follow in Christian's footsteps of football success to say the least. Brian's beloved O'Maury Samuels (RB) encountered legal problems and was quickly drummed out of the program. The crown jewel of 2017 was supposed to be its WR class, but the lauded four man group of receivers, all of them top 200 recruits, underwhelmed. DPJ was fine, but didn't quite live up to the 5* billing. Tarik Black's career was wrecked by injury and Oliver Martin didn't stick (not in Ann Arbor, nor anywhere in the B1G). Nico Collins did hit big time, but Michigan failed to use Nico to the extent that the NFL has since proven he should've been. 
Woulda been nice if Aubrey Solomon could've hit [Eric Upchurch]
The OL class was arguably just as disappointing, a five man group that produced one true star in can't miss C Cesar Ruiz, but also underwhelmed. JaRaymond Hall was a bust, Joel Honigford became a blocking TE, Chuck Filiaga was a useful reserve but never started before transferring, and Andrew Stueber became a decent starter. Not terrible, but not quite what was expected. Problems continued in the defensive trenches, where their two highest ranked players were complete whiffs, 5* Aubrey Solomon flashing potential but couldn't display any consistency and top 100 4* Luiji Vilain's Michigan career being destroyed by injury (both transferred). The staff frantically shuffled James Hudson between OL and DL and drove him to transfer, where he landed at Cincinnati and became an NFL Draft pick (that one hurt). Corey Malone-Hatcher never made it to campus for medical reasons, Deron Irving-Bey was a bust, Phil Paea seldom played, and Donovan Jeter was merely a usable rotational tackle by the end.  
The only big hit at Michigan out of the eight players Michigan signed at tackle or edge was Kwity Paye, arguably the best player from the class. Michigan signed three linebackers and much like at DL, the highest rated ones were total whiffs, Drew Singleton and Jordan Anthony (a 5* to one service). Josh Ross gave Michigan some production but even he had to come off the field on passing downs as a senior (we'll always remember his 3rd down stick vs. OSU though). Michigan didn't do poorly in the secondary but still missed on JKP and Ol' Woods. However, Ambry Thomas became very good but had a shortened career due to COVID, Brad Hawkins was the starting safety on a B1G championship team, and Benjamin St. Juste doesn't get to count for this exercise because he provided his value to Minnesota en route to the NFL due to a medical dispute with Michigan's doctors. 
The St. Juste story is sorta emblematic of this class. Michigan got some good players in it but they had a lot of scouting misses, glaringly so among "highly rated" players, and the real kicker was a lot of bad luck. Even when they nailed their scouting evals like on St. Juste, Black, and Hudson, a mix of injury and other problems intervened to ensure Michigan wouldn't be the ones benefitting from that scouting W. In the end, there were some stars, but the whiff rate was very high and the failures on the DL were directly responsible for the team's disastrous DT situation that helped sink the 2019 team, not to mention that it would've been really nice to hit on a QB to have a successor to Shea. A lot of lessons were seemingly learned by Harbaugh's staff on this one. 
[Bryan Fuller]
Biggest Contributors: Blake Corum, Roman Wilson, Zak Zinter, Kris Jenkins, Makari Paige, Jaylen Harrell 
Explanation: There were also some big whiffs in 2020, but the stars were a bit bigger than 2017's in my view and the overall hit rate was higher than 2017's, because 2020 was a smaller class to begin with. It didn't have the QB bust problem that 2017 did... because it didn't have a QB at all. JD Johnson's late-breaking medical ailment left them without a QB, tossing in Dan Villari just for the hell of it but that was never going to work. But at RB they hit as big of a home run as you can hit, reeling in Blake Corum. At WR they didn't do too shabby in snagging Roman Wilson, the highest drafted WR of the Harbaugh era and WR1 on a national title winning team. Their other WR was AJ Henning, a return specialist who we all loved and would've brought back for a senior year in 2023 if Henning didn't seek more playing time in Evanston (totally understandable). 
So that's off to a good start. Matt Hibner didn't provide much to Michigan at TE but he didn't outright bust either (another playing time transfer). The OL class' story isn't totally written until we know what happens to Jeff Persi's future, but that Zak Zinter guy was pretty damn good too. Following in the theme of the class, the OL group was small at just 3, with Reece Atteberry (transfer) the other. The same was true for the DL, getting just Braiden McGregor, Jaylen Harrell, and Kris Jenkins, all of whom worked out and rotated in on one of the best DL In Michigan history. That right there is what puts 2020 over 2017. 
[Patrick Barron]
Thus far you're probably thinking "this class actually sounds really good!!", but alas there were major issues in the seven. The LB position produced one player who made it to their senior year and that player made it as a RB, Kalel Mullings. Nikhai Hill-Green was on track as a second year player but injury intervened in 2022 and he transferred to Charlotte. Osman Savage, Cornell Wheeler, and William "Apache" Mohan were all straight up whiffs. Speaking of straight up whiffs, the CB room was pretty brutal as well, getting nothing out of their two recruits. I won't go further into discussing that out of respect for one of the said recruits, who recently passed away in tragic circumstances. 
At safety Michigan did a bit better. Jordan Morant never connected but both Makari Paige and RJ Moten played 1+ season as a starter at Michigan. Moten unfortunately forgot how to play football midway through the 2022 season and transferred to Florida, but he was usable in 2021 at least. Paige has been a good player and he is unfortunately the only consistently productive starter who made it to his senior season at the position he was recruited for out of 11 players Michigan recruited at LB/DB/S. Ouch. 
So yeah, there were issues with this class. But the success in the trenches and the star value Michigan got out of its top players between Corum, Zinter, Jenkins, and Roman Wilson elevates it a notch above the 2017 class. It wasn't the biggest class, it had an unfortunate (but uncontrollable) hole at the sport's most important position, it had some misses, that's why it lands here. But 2020 also gave us some foundational pieces for the 2021-2023 run, more than 2017 (or 2015) produced. 
[Patrick Barron]
Biggest Contributors: JJ McCarthy, Donovan Edwards, Rod Moore, Junior Colson, Rayshaun Benny 
Explanation: This story of this class isn't completely finished yet and I think it's quite possible that in a few years I will end up ranking it ahead of the next class above it. That's because players like Greg Crippen, Gio El-Hadi, Raheem Anderson, and TJ Guy haven't fairly been assessed yet. But there are also enough players here that we can begin to rank it and it clearly ranks pretty favorably. Why? First and foremost, JJ McCarthy. Dude was awesome! When you produce Michigan's best QB in multiple decades and the guy that wins you the national championship, that class automatically gets bumped up pretty high. But when you add stars at other positions next to it, that's a robust resume. 
McCarthy and local product Donovan Edwards were the backbone of 2021 and they've delivered a lot of value to Michigan in spite of Edwards' choppy 2023 season. That's a heck of a starting point, though it dips a bit when you look at the empty coffers at TE/WR, where Louis Hansen, Cristian Dixon, and Andrel Anthony all transferred. The OL group of El-Hadi, Crippen, Anderson, and Tristan Bounds is too early to grade. At the very least two of those four seem on track to start this fall and if some of them become good players (like we generally believe they will be), that will boost 2021's ranking up. 
The defensive side of the ball was bigger for the 2021 class and it has certainly produced stars, Junior Colson and Rod Moore. Neither guy needs much introduction, star-caliber starters on one of the best defenses in Michigan history. The rest of the defensive class is a bit unknown at the moment, with Rayshaun Benny being a productive contributor with the chance to get better. He's good, but the rest is up in the air. Outside of George Rooks, nobody has transferred, but beyond TJ Guy, no one seems on track to be a major contributor either. The likes of Ike Iwunnah, Kechaun Bennett, Tyler McLaurin, etc., players that exist on the roster but also have not contributed. We'll see what the next two seasons hold. Ja'Den McBurrows seems most likely besides Guy to become a player at this point in time. I do want to shout out Tommy Doman at special teams in this class, who had a fine season punting last year. 
Overall, the final verdict on the 2021 class is not totally in, but the value it has conveyed to Michigan I would slot in above 2020, 2018, and 2015 because the value McCarthy, Moore, Colson, and Edwards have provided in particular is so overwhelming, the star power so bright. Moreover, though we don't know the final narrative on all these guys, they also haven't had the level of attrition seen in other classes, 2017 in particular (where guys were bailing after a year or two in mass). We're going into fall 2024 and only four of 22 players have transferred by my count. The depth of success doesn't look like it will match the top classes on this list but I won't be shocked if it passes the next class on the list if a few of those OL end up hitting.

Biggest Contributors: Aidan Hutchinson, Michael Barrett, Ronnie Bell, Hassan Haskins, Jake Moody, Jaylen Mayfield, Cam McGrone
Explanation: Harbaugh's lowest rated class from a star-gazing perspective, the 2018 class was panned at the time but ended up being pretty good, all things considered. There were some misses, starting with the QB position as Michigan struck out on swing-for-the-fences project Joe Milton. Milton somehow played his way into being drafted- but did so at Tennessee. RB Christian Turner wasn't a bad Wolverine, but never became a star either, which did happen for one of the lowest rated recruits in the class, Hassan Haskins. The only player ranked lower than Haskins was fellow Missourian Ronnie Bell, who far outpaced his unknown recruiting profile to become a good receiver wearing the winged helmet. 
Bell was the class' only WR, as Michigan went light after their huge 2017 class at the position. They took Ben VanSumeren as a fullback (welp) and a pair of TEs. Fitting with the style of the class' underdog vibe, the lower rated one succeeded, as converted ex-QB Luke Schoonmaker became a starter and NFL draftee while 4* Mustapha Muhammad definitely did not. On the OL, they also went light after 2017 and took just two, a pair of classic Greg Frey (during his brief time at Michigan) targets as beanpole tight ends with the goal of beefing them into tackles. One was Jalen Mayfield, whose career was cut short due to COVID but was quite good when he played and parlayed that into a 3rd round draft slot. The other was Ryan Hayes, who started at left tackle on two B1G champion teams. Nice work, Mr. Frey! 
[Barron]
On the defensive line there was another glaring failure to recruit any defensive tackles at a time when they were very much needed, but their three-man EDGE class produced Aidan Hutchinson so we can't complain too much. Their other gets (Taylor Upshaw and Julius Welschof) didn't yield much but both players played five seasons in Ann Arbor and had the occasional good moment. Cam McGrone was the lone LB and the highest rated player in the class. He showed flashes of brilliance and probably would've been a stud in 2021 if he hadn't left early in (IMO) the worst NFL Draft departure decision of the past decade at Michigan. 
The DB crop had a lot of bodies but wasn't lauded at the time and shouldn't be now. The best of the bunch were Gemon Green and Vincent Gray. Yeah. Myles "Spider" Sims and Sammy Faustin transferred and the other Green was only a special teamser. We do have to mention the one name who wasn't discussed as a scholarship player at the time, Jake Moody. In the end, the local product was one of the biggest stars this class produced and had a hell of a run. 
Overall, this class was a testament to Michigan's scouting and development ability under Jim Harbaugh, but also reflects a class that was indeed cobbled together with lower rated guys. Toss in a half-dozen 4*s at the positions they were lacking (DT, DB, WR, QB) and you have a possibly incredible class. Instead, it was a merely good one. Some really good players, one pantheon-level superstar, not a ton of whiffs, but not quite the volume of big time contributors that the upper echelon classes had. Still, Michigan got far more than 22nd in the nation value out of the class and it was the greatest example of Jim Harbaugh's Moneyball recruiting style that we came to love. 
[Fuller]
Biggest Contributors: Rashan Gary, Lavert Hill, David Long, Devin Bush, Khaleke Hudson, Ben Bredeson, Mike Onwenu, Josh Uche
Explanation: It was a tight battle for the top spot on this list, but 2016 narrowly falls short of the other year under consideration (you can figure it out if you're familiar with time and deductive reasoning). That shouldn't denigrate 2016, though, which was a terrific class that was the backbone for a couple good squads in 2018 and 2019. They didn't ultimately accomplish what the later Harbaugh teams did on the field, but when you go down the list of names, this class had a ton of talent and very few misses. One miss was at the QB spot, an all-too-familiar theme in the early Harbaugh classes. Brandon Peters, at least you got Illinois to a bowl game and I'm sorry for what the 2017 OL did to you. 
2016's running back room was a bit frustrating, as Kareem Walker didn't work out for academic reasons and Chris Evans also had (different) academic reasons and was consistently under/mis-used when he played. But he was a good player who is still suiting up on Sundays so that counts for something. WR also didn't work out, as the trio of Nate Johnson, Kekoa Crawford, and Eddie McDoom amounted to a whole lot of nothing. Offensive skill positions were a big issue for this class but after that it was almost nonstop bangers. Sean McKeon was a useful starting TE who had a cup of coffee in the NFL and Nick Eubanks had a few moments in between injuries. 
[Eric Upchurch]
Michigan did exceptionally well at guard, where they nabbed two All-B1G studs who are both playing in the NFL in Ben Bredeson and Mike Onwenu. Those two + Cesar Ruiz formed an outstanding IOL on the 2018/2019 teams and the core of an excellent offensive line overall. It was also strong on the defensive line, as Rashan Gary perhaps wasn't quite the Ndamukong Suh 2.0 we hoped for but he was still a star and has unlocked more of that potential in the NFL with Green Bay. Carlo Kemp, often miscast at NT on an incredibly weak depth chart, was a serviceable player. 
Where the 2016 class shone the brightest was in the back seven. Devin Bush was probably the best LB of the Harbaugh Era and a first round pick. Khaleke Hudson was a multi-time All-B1G Viper. Devin Gil probably played too much but hey, that's getting on the field. David Long and Lavert Hill formed a fabulous 1-2 corner punch for two seasons (Lavert started for three years), both of them being All-B1G. Josh Metellus started for three seasons himself and parlayed that into an NFL career that has seen him continue to contribute for the Vikings. That group of players made up nearly the entirety of the 2018 defense that was the #1 defense in college football until [REDACTED], and most of the 2017 defense that was also elite wire-to-wire. 
The 2016 class had a ton of players who were stars in college and many have gone on to be productive NFLers. They had some misses on offense, but the hit rate for this class was pretty high as a whole. There was a high volume of contributors (I didn't even mention Quinn Nordin on special teams!), star power, and a high hit rate. Everything you want to see was here and they made a compelling case for the top spot, but ultimately I had to give it to the next group in part because this next group performed a bit better in the biggest moments and helped accomplish things on the field that 2016 unfortunately couldn't. 
[Barron]
Biggest Contributors: Mike Sainristil, Trevor Keegan, Mazi Smith, Mike Morris, David Ojabo, Dax Hill, DJ Turner II, Cornelius Johnson 
Explanation: The primary nucleus for the 2021-2023 teams that delivered unprecedented 21st century success to Michigan Football was this 2019 recruiting class, which had big hits at nearly every position, a high hit rate, and tons of stars. The class was was a vintage Michigan/Harbaugh Era class, 10th in the national rankings but delivering top 2-3 value when it was all said and done. The QB spot was held down by Cade McNamara, who didn't become a star but was still a starting QB for a B1G champion. The RB spot went to Zach Charbonnet, who ended up transferring, but that one feels pretty unfair to Charbonnet. At nearly any other school in the country, he'd have been a star starter and proved he could play in Ann Arbor. It's just he wasn't going to play ahead of Haskins and BC2, which, fair. Doesn't really count for my ranking purposes, but Charbonnet was another great piece of this class and is playing in the NFL for a reason. 
WR was a bit light, with return specialist Giles Jackson transferring, George Johnson not hitting, and a certain #0 figuring out he was better used on defense, but Cornelius Johnson was still good. Not a star per se, but good enough to torture Lathan Ransom on one Columbus afternoon. At TE we have a similar case to Zach Charbonnet in Erick All, who was a very good player at Michigan and a pivotal piece of the 2021 team's offense. He'd have kept contributing in A2 if not for injury and the fallout from disagreements over the treatment for said injury. Michigan took a six man OL class, 50% of whom hit and stayed, 50% of whom bailed. Jack Stewart, Zach Carpenter, and (most surprisingly given the rankings) Nolan Rumler transferred, with Carpenter becoming a starter elsewhere in the conference. But Trevor Keegan stayed and was a 3-year starting guard and got drafted. Karsen Barnhart was a very useful swingman for the OL and Trente Jones had a tumultuous career but was good when he played. That's 60% of the OL that beat Alabama and Washington right there... not bad!
[Barron]
Jumping over to defense, the DT tandem of Mazi Smith and Chris Hinton was the interior starting duo for Michigan's 2021 team. Smith became a first rounder and Hinton, like McGrone, left too early. Both solid to very good players. At EDGE, Michigan hit another home run with a tandem of Mike Morris and David Ojabo, two studs on the 2021 and 2022 teams. LB is the one spot in the class where Michigan really got nothing of value, with Anthony Solomon and Charles Thomas being poor fits for the post-Don Brown scheme change and Joey Velazquez being more useful to the baseball team than the football one. Oh well, you're always going to have one positional group that's not quite as good. 
The secondary class was maybe the biggest gem, five players, with four becoming useful. Three were stars, starting with Dax Hill at safety/nickel and DJ Turner II at corner, both of whom were picked highly in the NFL Draft by the Bengals. Mike Sainristil spent three years on offense, then joined the defense and was, well, Mike F****** Sainristil. Quinten Johnson took a while to convert into something but eventually rounded into a contributor, while Jalen Perry was never able to. 
Wrapping it up, I liked this class just a little bit more than 2016's, although it was close (as I mentioned). I liked the fact that they were the core of the championship teams, rather than the core of some ultra-frustrating teams. Again, not totally the fault of the players themselves, but also let's just say that there wasn't a big game dawg in the '16 class like Sainristil. By my count there were nine "star" players and that's not counting a Cornelius Johnson, nor Zach Charbonnet/Erick All. They had a few whiffs, but not many and it was a remarkably balanced class, with impact players at nearly every position. If you're building a CFP contender, you want every class to look like the 2019 class. 
[Fuller]
2024 hasn't even played a single game yet, so let's toss that one out the window. Who knows! 2023 is also really too early, a class that has some players I like but I was overall pretty tepid on at the time (and mostly still am). We'll see if it can beat my modest expectations. But that 2022 class, ohhhhhhh baby. Michigan won a national title in 2023 because CONNOR STALIONS they hit a grand slam with 2019, banked a few big time stars at key positions in both 2020 and 2021, and then hit another grand slam in 2022, picking up superstar caliber players who were ready to contribute as underclassmen. 
The star power of 2022 is as good as any class between Mason Graham, Kenneth Grant, Will Johnson, and Colston Loveland. Wowza. I wouldn't be surprised if Derrick Moore's name is added to the list by the end of this season. Tyler Morris, Keon Sabb, and Jimmy Rolder were also ready to pitch in in depth capacities relatively early in their careers, which was a major boon for the '23 squad. There were also promising players in that class who we haven't gotten to see much of yet but could be starters this fall, including Andrew Gentry, Amorion Walker, and Zeke Berry, as well as Marlin Klein who may be a partial starter (or a starter in 12 personnel, etc.). It's a bit lacking at QB unless Alex Orji really hits, and CJ Stokes didn't work out at RB, but man was this class incredible at the top. Some of the greatest scouting wins in Michigan history were in 2022 and when it's all said and done, I have little doubt that 2022 will be right there with 2019/2016 as the best Harbaugh Era recruiting classes.

The Athletic actually does this every year for the class that committed 4 years ago. They used this point system for their ranking:
Michigan classes have generally done well in their assessment, especially recently with 2018-2020 all being top 3 IIRC (2017 didn't even make the top 25 despite being a top 5 class). Here's the one they did a few months ago for the 2020 class: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5510780/2024/05/28/college-football-recruiting-2020-class-rankings-revisited/?campaign=9964985&source=untilsaturday_newsletter&userId=437916

There was a Twitter link in a UV a while back about exactly this—during the Harbaugh Era, UM & Iowa are firmly #1 & #2 in players outperforming their recruiting rankings.
The difference is Iowa recruits at a Top 40-ish level, so over-performance tops out at B1G West Champs.
UM, however, recruits at a Top 10-ish level, so over-performance tops out at stuffing everyone other than the Georgia Eagles into a trash can for three consecutive seasons.

Great stuff. I think you left a couple of the contributors off of the initial “contributors” list, no biggie.
That 2022 class is up there in rankings even without the coming years.
Harbaugh’s pivot to scout-and-develop wasn’t perfect at every position, but it was huge and instrumental. Michigan doesn’t win a title without it. The other contenders zigged. Harbaugh tried it for a bit, then zagged hard.
The guys dancing on Jalen Milroe’s psyche weren’t top-20 recruits. But they played like it.

We've all heard the account of what he said before the 4th quarter in Columbus.  It's funny that in my memory, I see it from a spot on that sideline that's not possible.  Like I was actually there.  I wasn't. So, I'm a grown-ass old man totally inspired by a dude half my age.  But, like, there are a ton of players from last year's team I could say the same thing about.

     Very good qualitative overview. I wonder if this would match a quantitative analysis. Recruiting rankings are based on stars. So what if we were to assign stars to each player by season. Contributor: 1 starStarter: 2 stars 
All Big HM/3rd team: 3 stars 
All Big 1st/2nd team: 4 stars 
All American: 5 stars 
A guy who sits his first year (0 stars), plays special teams and is in the rotation as a sophomore (1 star), blows up his 3rd year (AA, 5 stars) gives you 6 stars. Is he more or less valuable than a 3 year starter (6 stars) who never gets to above an average starter? I know that’s a ton of work and would be very subjective, but it is the off-season.

If the former player had an AA year would he also get credit for all b10 assuming he achieved both, or is the classification mutually exclusive? I think an aa year should be worth more than 3 avg years of starting but that could be accomplished by changing the weightings.

I think I would start with some arbitrary ranking system, see if it matched my pre-conceived expectations, and adjust accordingly. I guess what I’m saying is that Alex’s analysis is sufficient, I just like seeing numbers.

Jordan Morant and Myles Sims were 2 guys I was super excited for that we completely whiffed on. If I remember correctly, Morant got injured his senior year of HS and was never the same and Myles sims was a beanpole who couldn't put on any weight and was unplayable
Watching Rashan Gary on Sundays does have me think often about how, even though he was good in college, we completely misused him. Rashan Gary in our current defensive scheme would've been a 10 -15 sack guy in the Hutchinson role and I don't think that's even that controversial to say

I just don’t think Gary has the bend.  If he gained 30 lbs in college instead of losing 30lbs, he might have been a 6’ 5” 330 lb wrecking machine at DT.  He was dead set on being an edge though, so we’ll never know.

Gary is a monster edge in the NFL.  And if healthy in 2018 and provided good pass rush opportunities by virtue of position in the defense, he’d have been a monster there at Michigan as well.  (He was quite good while healthy in 2017, when his primary responsibility in Don Brown’s defense as an “anchor” was eating blocks.)

Thanks for doing this, Alex. It's very informativeRegarding the outrageous scouting coups of the 2022 class: I can sorta get how Mason Graham was a sleeper since, like many Michigan football players under Harbaugh, he was a multi-sport guy rather than a camp fiend, and he's also not a "first off the bus" guy in terms of his build. However, I'm going to need the entire recruiting rankings industry to explain to me how they whiffed on Kenneth Grant. You'd think all you'd need to do to put that kid in your top 100 is take one look at him and then verify that he can bend his knees and has decent explosion. But hey, I'm glad they all screwed up, because we got the type of dude who's usually headlining a class for Georgia

The 22 class was all sorts of messed up due to their formative years being during Covid. Graham dominated his senior year, but it was easy to write him off as a "peaked too early" guy since he didn't do many camps or all star games. Nobody went to go scout Grant (other than EJ Holland).
Either way, both Graham and Grant were fairly highly rated by the services that loved them. Rivals had Graham as the #162 (#209 to 247) player and On3 had Grant #102. Just not quite at the 5* impact they've shown

One little bit pick: Lathon Ransom was terrible in 2022.  Cornelius Johnson was spectacular but not against each other.  Ransom was mostly victimized by The Don and Colston Loveland. Johnson made a legend of himself against the Cameron’s: Brown and Martinez

Michigan built its National Championship on finding lineman who could be developed into All-B1G players and then tried to fill in around them.  We will all be watching to see if the scouting and development left with Harbaugh and staff, or if they can keep it up.
Either way, they got it all to come together for one magical season - the 5* QB with Blake the Great and a 7-deep OL to pair with a 9-deep DL leading the way for one of the best defenses Michigan's ever had.  Here's hoping we can keep that development rolling and build back up to that peak.

Not sure I agree, but Hassan Haskins, Michael Barrett, Ronnie Bell, Jake Moody, and Aidan Hutchinson really made an impact!  They made college football so much fun again, coming back after the 2020 disaster to revitalize the program...

Great write-up.  One factor that makes recruiting really enjoyable to follow is how the entire process is one of hope and optimism.  And, Alex speaks again into the fascinating and sobering reality of how difficult it can be to predict the college success of recruits in the 3-4star range - seeing many who just did not pan out for us (along with those who lived up to or surpassed their recruiting expectations).

That 2016 class was probably the most talented on paper. I was thinking if JH could develop a QB we would beat OSU regularly after 2017 but I forgot how Hoke left the OL and DL cupboards bare. It just takes time to develop the trenches but we have been good in the last 3 years in development and depth.

the athletic re-evaluated that 2018 class based on production/draft status and they finished 5th. that was the first year where it became obvious that the staff was slow-playing the recruitment of players that they ranked a lot higher than the services did. the staff has since acknowledged that they did and do continue to slow play recruiting on those types of players where an early offer might prompt a service to rerank a player and prompt other major programs to come back and kick the tires.  moody's recruitment was so low-key most folks (including the ones here) thought he was a walk-on when his name appeared on the roster. mason graham was another example and he's turned out to be one of the best ever in terms of ranking vs. production under harbaugh's tenure.the 2017 class underwhelmed from a ranking perspective. ruiz kept that class from being a total failure. that fact will continue to be ignored by those who need to believe that classes rankings must be "elite" for a program to be elite. so be it.it seems to me that apparent 'failures' and underproduction could be attributed to the coaching and/or scheme.  collins and evans were alluded to briefly, but i'd suggest that a lot of the defensive players might have been more productive under someone other than don brown while more recently recruited players could benefit from the new defensive scheme. imagine rashan gary unleashed in a ravens' style defense. he's doing quite well as a OLB with the packers. it's also more obvious to me that since 2020 we've recruited for the ravens' scheme, especially when it comes to the DBs where we've also slow played some of the recruiting as well.

It is interesting to walk back through all these Classes, when I read the initial paragraph I had a rough ranking in my head, and 2019 was not even on my Radar. I was thinking of the stars in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021. When I saw BC2, Zinter, and Roman ranked 5th I was almost offended since BC2 and Zinter are two of the best players (At their position) in the history of Michigan football. Then I kept reading. Well done Alex, thanks for the perspective and trip down memory lane. Glad its mostly happy memories and not "what might have been".
