Home » Post Malone Teases Another A-List Country Collaboration With Chris Stapleton
The list of guest stars that Post Malone is featuring on his forthcoming country album, F-1 Trillion, keeps getting longer and more impressive by the day. Posty shared an Instagram reel late Wednesday, featuring the singer getting loose and rocking out in the recording studio while listening to a snippet of his fiery new country jam. “This one’s with @chrisstapleton,” was his simple caption, alerting his fans to another high-profile collaboration that is coming their way sometime soon. Assuming this potent new tune is included on the final F-1 Trillion tracklist, you can add Chris Stapleton to the prestigious list of special guests on Post Malone’s forthcoming record, which already includes country superstars Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, and Blake Shelton. Post Malone is set to take all these new tunes of his on the road this fall on his “A Collection Of Country Songs” tour. (Holler)
