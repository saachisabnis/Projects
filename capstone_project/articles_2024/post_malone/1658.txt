YG has taken a page out of Cam’ron‘s playbook and launched his own male enhancement product named Cherry Bomb.
Released on Thursday (February 15), Cherry Bomb features all-natural ingredients according to product’s official site, and will “improve the physical appearance” of a man’s member and “intensify” the sexual experience. It also promises to “boost your nighttime experience without killing your morning vibe.”

The Clermont Twins appear in an ad alongside the Compton rapper to promote the new pill, which you can view below.
Cherry Bomb is available now here for $23.99.
Cam’ron’s Pink Horse Power brand has been a successful business venture for the Harlem native. Jadakiss, Ludacris, Rae Sremmurd, Amber Rose and comedian Michael Blackson have all co-signed the supplement, which claims to “empower man’s sexual intimacy by helping to improve stamina and libido.”
Cam recently rolled out a new product known as Blue Horse Power, which is allegedly five times stronger than the original.
