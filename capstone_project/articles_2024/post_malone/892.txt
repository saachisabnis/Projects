The list of collaborators that Post Malone has worked with in the country world continues to grow more impressive with each passing day. Luke Combs posted an Instagram reel where he shared a snippet from an unreleased song, with the tantalizing caption, “We doin’ this or what, @postmalone?” That post alone caused excitement all across the country music, but before fans even had a chance to process that thrilling reveal, Posty went and upped the game with a comment he made on Combs’ reel. 
“Okay, FINE 😤 but you like this more than the other one?!?! 😈” So, not only have Posty and Combs worked together on one forthcoming collaboration, but there are now two as yet unheard songs out there that the country superstars have joined forces on. No release date or additional information has been shared for the uptempo song about lost love that Combs shared, but hopefully the musicians won’t keep their fans waiting too long to hear one – or both – of their country collaborations.
