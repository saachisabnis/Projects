Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers celebrated its 28th year and the opening of its 828th restaurant in Boston on Wednesday with the opening of an all-gold restaurant.
The Baton Rouge, La.-founded concept, owned by Todd Graves, welcomed Celtics legend and Olympic gold medalist Jrue Holiday, Red Sox first baseman David Ortiz and musician Jacob Dodge Lawson, known professionally as Jvke, had a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
The event also featured a golden birthday cake designed by baker Buddy Valastro, known as the “Cake Boss.”
The gold-themed restaurant at 101 Arch St. in Boston was created to mark the event, featuring gold walls, floors and seating as well as kiosks.
Jvke, a 22-year-old TikTok phenomenon known for the hit song “Golden Hour,” performed for the crowd as well.
Raising Cane’s was spreading the wealth, offering customers across the nation a chance to win 828 golden prizes worth $100,000 through RaisingCanesBirthday.com. Prizes included gold bars, coins and nuggets, necklaces and shoes.
Raising Cane’s has created special restaurants with singer Post Malone in Utah and with Malone and the Dallas Cowboys.
Throughout the year, Cane’s has committed to giving back $28 million to communities across the U.S., building on its nearly $140 million given back over the past 28 years.
