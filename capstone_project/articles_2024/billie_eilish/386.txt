(By Randy Lane) We are in the midst of THE most intense presidential election. Within two weeks, we’ve witnessed an assassination attempt on a former president, the present one bowing out, and a new candidate emerging.
These stories are not just political stories; they are universal stories being talked about by your audience regardless of format. If radio is to remain relevant among all media platforms, it can’t ignore the biggest story on the planet.
Music station shows
Some of the music station shows we coach did not mention any of these stories. While it’s true that most listeners to music stations come to escape from hard news and be entertained, some stories can’t be ignored.
As an authentic personality, ignoring stories that permeate all ages and walks of life ensures you and your show are out of touch. When all-encompassing stories come up in the future, here are some ways to execute them:
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
News/Talk shows
This presidential news cycle is a gift. The next 100 days are an excellent branding opportunity for the format. Your audience is already increasing rapidly, and here are three ways to maintain the momentum:
Music and News/Talk can get involved
Voting ensures democracy functions effectively and accurately reflects the will of the people. Listeners are so passionate about their candidate and party that both sides want to make their voices heard through voting.
Your show and station can connect with the election passion by serving as a primary source for voter information. Music stations and objective news stations can remain neutral and involved. Your messaging can include the point of registering only U.S. citizens.
Five nonprofit and nonpartisan voting sources:
Voter registration drives
Some shows and stations set up booths to register people to vote at community events. The process differs from state to state. Here in Tennessee, an organization picks up voter registration forms at the county election commission, which advises them on voter registration requirements before an event.
National Voter Registration Day has a complete guide to voter registration for every state.
