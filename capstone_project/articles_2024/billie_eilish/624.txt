As a reminder, Michigan technically has three DT roles—nose, tackle, and end—in their base 3-4 (that I call a 5-2 (and which functions more like a 4-3 under)). A majority of the time however Michigan will be in a bog standard 4-2-5 nickel. According to my charting they averaged 4.16 linemen per down both of the last two years. In 2021 they faced base-2TE outfits a rare-for-this age six times (Wisconsin, MSU, NIU, Iowa, Georgia, and Washington) and averaged… 4.26 linemen. Benny will get bonus snaps at End, but for our purposes Graham and Grant are your starters, and Benny is their backup, with Graham sliding over to nose when Grant is out.
Also technically only Mason Graham was a starter last year, but we know. The world knows. Even as they were preparing for the national championship the kinds of insiders who pass along stuff from agents were saying Oregon and Texas had offered "whatever it takes" to bring in "either of the two most valuable assets in college next year." This had long-term effects on Michigan's NIL approach and probably led to some warnings to agents who might ever want a player from Michigan again, but also buried the lede:
two most valuable assets in college next year.
[Patrick Barron]
If Michigan's defense leads them to a 1997 Michigan/2021 Georgia kind of season, it'll be because MASON "ol' Murderglasgow" GRAHAM was the most outstanding player in college football. Entering his junior year he is certainly tracking that way. He is PFF's top-returning DT.
Graham was excellent in his first year at Ann Arbor, leading all FBS true freshmen interior defensive linemen with an 80.3 PFF grade. He took his game to a whole new level as a sophomore. According to PFF's wins above average metric, he was the fourth-most valuable defensive tackle in the nation and was sixth in that same group with a 15.9% pass-rush win rate. Graham was one of only two interior defensive linemen in the country to finish with top-10 grades as both a pass rusher and run defender. The other was Texas’ T’Vondre Sweat.
The rising junior has a relentless motor to combine with ridiculous agility that makes him nearly unblockable. Even if an offensive lineman gets a clean shot on him, he has great power at 6-foot-3, 318 pounds to shed the block and find the ball carrier. Graham’s a nearly complete defensive tackle who’ll continue terrorizing Big Ten offenses on his way to likely becoming a high selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. If he was eligible for the 2024 draft, he’d likely be the first defensive tackle off the board.
Ah yup. Pick a defensive play you remember from last year and chances are the "oh shit" began with Mason Graham was ping-ponging between blockers.
[After THE JUMP: You're killing me Smalls.]
HE WAS A FIVE-STAR IN ALL WAYS BUT LITERALLY. Typically once a player has established himself we don't bother to go back to the recruiting profile again, but in Graham's case it's warranted to show he's been on the same development track as the Travon Walkers, Kayvon Thibodeauxs, Chase Youngs, Nick Bosas, and Myles Garretts who were elite coming into college and elite coming out. All through the championship run people were arguing that Michigan was doing it without the kind of "talent" that Ohio State/Georgia/Alabama bid out every year, but in every sense but literally Graham was a top-five player of his class.
Reasons he was not despite destroying America's toughest high school league while playing every snap both ways were all bad:
Nobody said the last one but it has to be, because when it comes to “talent” it’s hard to make the case that anyone ranked higher than Graham should have been. One of these are the PFF grades for the freshman and sophomore years of Walter Nolen, the #2 overall player in Graham’s class who caused all sorts of gnashing of teeth among Michigan fans because our NIL program wasn’t going to outbid Texas A&M. The other are the grades of the guy Michigan went after when they stopped pursuing Nolen.
If it wasn’t obvious, the top one is Graham. Sites get these things wrong all the time—Georgia’s Jordan Davis was a 3-star—but it’s clear Graham had as much “talent” as anyone in his class. Bruce Feldman gave him an honorable mention in this year’s annual freaks article:
Junior Mason Graham, a disruptive force at 6-3 and 315 pounds who was first-team all-conference in 2023, clocked a 4.69 in the 20-yard shuttle and could do the Turkish get-up with a 150-pound dumbbell.
When we gather info on recruits it's pretty easy to see which guys are underrated; when I did Graham's recruiting profile I cried about the unfairness of our "Sleeper of the Year" rules because even after two sites pumped him a four-star it was clear they were coming in WAY short. "Bad Guy" was a reference to the Billie Eilish song my daughter loves where she's singing "duh" at everybody that I used for subheads throughout.
General Excitement Level: Bad Guy. I don't want to be the type who goes for all the scrappy white guy terms, but you know how I feel about defensive tackles who make a hash out of everything inside. If this guy's got half the attitude on and off the field that they're talking about already, he's going to be a Chase Winovich-level folk hero, especially if the NFL is worried about his measurements and we get to keep him around an extra year or two, with NIL's help.
Brian also tried to get hyperbolic and still came up short.
And… okay. There's a 15% chance I'm going to bury this take in twenty feet of steel and concrete at some future date, but this feels like Hutchinson.
Somehow "Hey, this commit should be ranked like Rashan Gary" undersold it—Graham averaged a +5.3, –1.8, = +3.6 in my 2022 UFR grading, pipping 2016 Gary's +5.5, –2.1 = +3.5 for best freshman in charting history (Graham's classmates Will Johnson and Derrick Moore were 3rd and 4th). By Hawai'i I was putting the kids' college funds into MG55s. By midseason he had acquired his prospectin' name OI' Murderglasgow so I could shorthand his exploits as "OMG." By the second game of his sophomore year he was going poing-poing-poing-TFL through UNLV like Ndamukong Suh.
…and already getting the RS junior Mo Hurst treatment where not all +2 plays get clipped anymore because we already get the point.
I also thought I detected Ryan Glasgow?
Ah, the other gift from the football gods. Mason Graham was the player of the game, and a major reason for the utter lack of an ECU run game despite all of the RPOs and weird stuff, like this attempt at a shovel pass that he momentarily intercepted:
Peacock announcing: not exactly Fox.
Most of his day was spent taking on doubles so his teammates could force RPOs into runs, and he still put up a +12 in 27 snaps, which is Mike Martin territory, by winning blocks and making himself part of the tackle. I'm still clipping this stuff so Graham isn't officially Boringly Good in his first game of his true sophomore season, but that's where he's tracking.
That point: Mason Graham is the best tackle in college football, for the all reasons PFF mentioned.
“RELENTLESS MOTOR.” I mean one of last season's underratedly scariest moments was a targeting review on Graham in the 2nd half against Maryland that would have held him out for The Game, because Graham doesn't know how to turn it off. After that…he still didn't turn it off.
This was just as true on the first snap out of halftime of a one-score National Championship game as it was up 35 deep in the third quarter against a Mountain West team.
Washington's bag of tricks included a fake false start that fooled Kenneth Grant but bought Penix another 4th quarter hit because Mason Graham does not turn down reps.
When he came back from breaking his hand against Bowling Green he was wearing a club and making up for lost time.
This is Aidan Hutchinson-level motor. In OMG Russia the defensive tackle wears you down. He is the most doubled man on the team and yet—Dr. Sap pointed this out to me and early last season and I’ve been looking out for it since—at the end of every game he is running around the field while the guards and centers he just abused have their hands on their hips.
“RIDICULOUS AGILITY.” Talk about a doom squirrel at 318 pounds:
 “NEARLY UNBLOCKABLE.” Why "nearly"?
THIS IS WHY MICHIGAN CAN PLAY 5.5 VERSUS THE RUN. I spent large portions of last season talking about Michigan’s apparent plan for Ohio State, which was to play a man down in the box so they could have an extra guy defending the pass. The reason they could get away with that was they were using Graham the way Georgia used to play Jordan Davis, IE have him align head up over the guard while still covering gaps like he was lined up over the nose.
This is EXTREMELY HARD to do with consistency because you’re giving the offense a great big bubble in the middle where they have all the angles and your DT has to fight back against the play to close down that lane. Here’s a look at what happens when Graham cannot do so:
That he was able to not get washed down like the above with any consistency was the reason Michigan was able to get away with it to such a degree that they made it the plan for dealing with Treyveon Henderson and told everyone they were going to do it by repping it against Maryland.
So this is how Michigan wants to defend stretch:
The point here is what happens when that DT doesn't prevent the frontside of his double-team from getting downfield. There's plenty of material coming from the backside to handle cutbacks, but you have to slow the run down. When it's working, Michigan fans are treated to what looks like an incredible play by the guy coming in from the backside. When I review these plays, usually the guy most responsible is actually the one who forced the cutback, not the pursuit.
Graham is the best I’ve seen since Hurst at getting playside of his doubles and then making everybody stop. That takes some insane strength and agility to do with any consistency. And it’s not just on zone that this matters. Any kind of blocking that involves doubles—and Graham sees a LOT of those—requires a DT to know the precise moment he needs to violently disengage from the blocking so the OL can’t reengage as the ballcarrier goes by. I lost all my old clips when Snap bought gfycat just to shut it down (/shakes fist) and the power outage means I can’t go back to my databank to get it (/shakes other fist) so for now you will have to trust my description of this from the 2022 Nebraska UFR (at about 1:20 of the 1st Q):
Graham(+2) gets a double, gives ground then times the release of one to swim past the other. He gets the RB's leg and doesn't let go. Barrett(+1) dodges the one that released to help stuff.
I was already Very Mad I couldn’t find the clip online when I came across Brian discussing the same play in last year’s preview:
Michigan has 5.5 guys in the box there so someone getting doubled for a long time; Graham mostly sticks and is able to help tackle after a meh gain. This one is even more emphatic; he anticipates when the second guy is going to leave and then rips him past, using that momentum to burst upfield and tackle:
That is crazy. I cannot even express to you how hard that is. It is like watching a six-year old girl crush Through The Fire and Flames on Guitar Hero.
I promise to re-upload it when I’m home again (probably Thursday night after we do MGoRadio). Anyway the plan to squeeze backside gaps tighter than a pickle jar worked well enough that we now have a healthy collection of photos of underclassman Graham running the back into a cool-looking tackle.
“I loosened it.” –Mason Graham. [Bryan Fuller]
This turned 1st & goal from the nine into 2nd & goal from the 14, necessitating an underneath throw to get to a makeable 4th down that they didn't make.
“EXPLOSIVE”. I mean… it's in all of the clips. The attention he draws created a lot of Michigan's four-man pressure rate last year. LG#76 below has two guys to his left who can help on Graham, and he's still so worried about getting edged (by a DT!!!) that he's five yards in the backfield at the edge logo when Stewart stunts inside.
Goode is still on the hash where he started. This entire pass rush lane was brought to you by Mason Graham.
Strong? Watch him throw #71 so far into the backfield he's in the path of his running back's veer.
“DANGEROUS PASS RUSHER.” Check! In last year's preview Brian suggested this was the kind of thing one of his weirder employees—say, Seth—might turn into a song.
GRAHAM'S PASS RUSH could be one of those things that gets sung about in, uh, song. Last year he checked in with an 11% win rate and a 73 PFF grade, which are approximately on par with a redshirt junior Ryan Glasgow. The next year Glasgow leapt up to a 17% win rate and an 89 grade playing next to Mo Hurst, who slightly bettered those numbers.
Sophomore Graham more or less matched senior Glasgow, with a 16.4% win rate and 85 grade. But I did not write any lyrics, because I was without words.
In the national championship. Against the team that just won the Joe Moore Award, specifically for pass protection. I am speechless.
I went through the game again to make sure and there were four plays when Penix was able to stay clean long enough to read through his progressions, and a few more when he had an opportunity to step up into a throw because they went to a 7-man protection. But if you really want to narrow your focus to one thing Michigan can do that nobody else can replicate, it's they can roll out three of the best DTs in college football, two of whom were true sophomores.
When the 2018 season came crashing down, part of the story was Indiana showing you could single-block both DTs and save your help for Rashan Gary and Chase Winovich. On a passing down in 2023-'24 you can double a tackle and chip both DEs and your tombstone will read "Singled Mason Graham."
That win rate might undersell things, because Graham was the player demanding the most doubles and triples of anyone on Michigan's terrifying defensive line last year. Our theory on pass rushes is you can have an edge player winning every snap and it won't matter because the quarterback can just step up past the rush. A DT who can consistently dent the pocket means every win outside is mayhem.
He also demands so much attention that Michigan's other linemen get to star against single-blocking. We'll come back to this play for another guy in a minute but Graham's feet are too quick and his hands too strong for this right guard, who luckily has the center assigned to help him if he gets run around, which he does.
#55 try to focus on #55 on the right
That guard, #77 Julius Buelow, received a 2.4(!!!) pass blocking grade to PFF against Michigan after putting up a 65 against Texas and an 83 against Oregon, IE against the top three tackles taken in the 2024 Draft. Brandon Dorius, T'Vondre Sweat, and Byron Murphy? No…uh…problem. Mason Graham and friend? Two point four.
Graham's Mo Hurstian explosion made Michigan a tough team to tempo. Ohio State got an incredible catch from Marvin Harrison on a well-covered fade and went tempo to try to capitalize on momentum. Graham was ready to go and instantly around left guard Matthew Jones.
Bull rush? I mean yes the very strong man has a bull rush.
Hate on his arm length all you want but his strength is enough to stiffarm a guy who needs to come off him on a stunt while running through the tackle picking him up.
The Glasgowian push-pull move was there in 2022 and even angrier in 2023. Brian:
Mason Graham was a main driver of this on stunts. His ability to explode, force OL to deal with him, and move them led to multiple plays where the looper got through, none more critical than the Kenneth Grant sack in the fourth quarter:
Mason's push-pull rips the center down just as Grant zips through, and the big man is Gabe Watson, but fast.
Graham was also working on a not-quite baked spin move that I think I saw once in his high school film and which he tried late in the Championship while emptying out the drawer.
You can see he's a little surprised it worked and has to re-accelerate from scratch. Teach that foot to plant coming out of the spin and this throw doesn't even get off. Upside!
SAY SOMETHING NEGATIVE OR YOU’RE JUST A SLAPPY. If there's any athletic limitation here, it's that Graham doesn't match some former DL who had tremendous verticals to bat down passes. He got the one against Hawai'i in 2022:
He may only get to do the Mutombo that once. Also his arm length isn’t ideal. I happen to like short, powerful wrestling types but NFL Draft buzz thinks he could be taller:
While Graham’s physical attributes and motor are impressive, he needs to expand his pass-rush moves to consistently beat NFL-caliber blockers. His shorter stature can be a disadvantage when facing taller linemen, and he sometimes struggles to disengage from blocks, limiting his snap-to-snap effectiveness. Addressing these areas will be key for his development and impact at the next level.
The only other business was a rumor that Graham was among a pandemic of Michigan players dinged up (or “dinged up”?) last week, but he’s apparently practicing again and good to go. This concludes the portion of this article where anything negative can be said about Mason Graham.
[Barron]
HE DOES NOT MAKE MISTAKES. The main reason Graham’s freshman emergence felt so unprecedented is defensive tackle is extremely hard to learn. The blocks come so quickly you have to not just learn to recognize and anticipate a thousand subtle clues, but commit them past memory to instinct. The weird thing about charting Graham isn’t the number of plays he makes but the ratio of positives to negatives. I was almost relieved when he had a –2 event versus UConn because I was worried I wasn’t charting right. I issued Graham only five –2s total in his true freshman season in 300 snaps, and just one (ONE!!!!) in 2023. That wasn’t even getting blocked; it was for roughing Tagovailoa and initiating the world’s most terrifying targeting review.

I put together a great spreadsheet of all of our UFR charting only for the power to go out with the file stuck on my desktop, but fortunately I was dumping googly-eyed screenshots in the MGoSlack so I can show you that Mason Graham’s total true sophomore season was fifty percent better than the next-best 19-year-old. That was…
Class of 2022: pretty good.
It also ranks among the best performances in school history, with an argument for top-five if you factor out 2020’s small sample (TOT is total +/-):
This is what I mean about the dangers of underrating Mason Graham. I looked at a borderline 3-/4-star and said I think he’ll be a four-year player we remember like Chase Winovich at the end, and in Year 2 he was BETTER THAN SENIOR CHASE WINOVICH. Any sort of hype short of deranged is liable to come up short.
BUT MICHIGAN’S LINE WAS SO DEEP HE COULD AFFORD TO ROTATE? Concerns that an increased snap count in 2024 will sap some of the defensive tackles' effectiveness are less founded with Graham than his compatriot. We used to say this because this is the kid who told a recruiting reporter he could play another 60 minutes after defeating another top-five school, but Michigan increased his snap count significantly through last year's SURVIVE AND ADVANCE portion of the season, and he looked as fresh on his 26th snap…
…as on his 41st.
He was on the field for 42/58 snaps against Ohio State, 48/66 snaps against Alabama (and made the most explosive play on the field in overtime) and 46/74 snaps against Washington, most of any DL and equivalent to the usage of starting cornerback Josh Wallace. If you ratchet that up to 60 snaps as a junior yes, you might get some dropoff, but even 2011 Mike Martin/RVB only did that sort of thing once. I can't even predict a normal sophomore-to-junior snaps increase because he was already playing more than any other upperclassman DT you can remember. Even as a freshman Graham was putting out extreme BTUs late in the 4th quarter after getting locked on the field for awhile.
MASON GRAHAM FOR HEISMAN. I’m serious. I was already talking about it after Minnesota but the official campaign kicked off against Maryland.
Nobody on this team is a Hutchinson.
Yet. The true sophomore class is probably going to go down as the greatest Michigan ever recruited. But even today I'd argue we have an All-American and 2024 Heisman candidate in our midst. Literally. Michigan had no fear of punting from midfield up five in the fourth quarter because when you let Mason Graham at a pass protection he's going to grab everybody's attention.   
Even when he's not collecting the sacks, he's part of the reason for them. Kenneth Grant's sack starts because Graham is ripping the center down to the ground. The LG sees this and instead of the 340-pound man coming inside of him he decides to take the one who killed his friend.    
#55 the 2nd DL from the top
There are many more clips that I picked up for other guys where Graham's doing something worthy in the background. So many good outcomes for this defense begin with him. Also the club came off.
This was before the Ohio State-[Poor Iowa]-Rose Bowl-Natty portion of the season but after OMG returned with a club on his hand to put a Minnesota lineman into the path of a running back veer.
The following week, still clubbed, he blasted his guard four yards into the backfield on a 4th & 3, disengaged, picked up a fumble, and had designs on a 62-yard return while dressed head to toe in Tom Allen’s finest.
When the competition ratcheted up in the Survive & Advance portion of the season Graham somehow got even better. Pick a moment from the last two seasons and he was either the man causing it or the guy who set it up. Try me; I dare you. Edwards goes 75 and 85 yards? Well in between those Ohio State drove within 21 yards of making it a one-score game before Graham fought through three blockers to flush Stroud into a back-breaking pick.
Moore’s interception? Obviously. Sainristil and Johnson’s interceptions in the natty? Who do you think? When Ohio State did have a one-score game late in the 4th quarter at Michigan, Graham was supplying pressure every play, even if it meant stunting around against a tackle.
We already mentioned Rose Bowl overtime and the first play out of the Championship halftime, etc. But the reason this game is so easy to play is it’s just what Graham does down to down. Before those games got to the Hero portions there were mid-game slogs where Michigan's offense was sputtering and the opponents were clawing back, only to keep losing their purchase.
Did they murder this comer?
They did.
Was it Graham?
It was.
Heisman?
LFG. Earlier I slobbered over how Bama used a fullback insert as the playside of a double-team to counter Michigan's preferred strategy of:
…and surprising the DT as he comes off his ass-kicking. That worked on Grant, but not the second time, when it was tried on Graham.
#55 DT on the bottom hash
A big part of the early pressure was also due to a lot of attention being paid to Graham. That attention was both necessary, and debilitating.
He picked up one minus all day from getting sealed by a double, and a hard minus for spinning out of contain to try to get a facemask call. He led the DL with 48 snaps, as Alabama's Single-Wing personnel necessitated a more-than-usual amount of snaps for the 5-2 group, and Benny went out after the 2nd play. That makes it all the more impressive that Graham was still fresh enough to explode through the line in overtime.   
When Hutchinson made his run at the Heisman he stated his case by having the best game in program history—competition invariant—against Ohio State’s best offense ever. Versus a still-elite-but-not-THAT-elite OSU last year Mason Graham had a mere +16, –0.5 = +15. It is insane to suggest that someone just three years later—and a year younger—could ever challenge Hutchinson's +39.5. I'm saying there's a chance.
People are getting on board. Rick Spielman has $20 he's a top-5 pick and would take him over Jalen Carter and Quinyan Williams.
K.C. Martinez of Draft Network puts him in the top ten and describes a disruptor who just needs to learn some moves.
Mason Graham is a high-motor defensive lineman with excellent quickness off the snap and a relentless pursuit of the ball. His ability to penetrate the backfield and disrupt both the run and pass game makes him a versatile and impactful player. Graham's wrestling background gives him superior leverage and balance, making him tough to handle in one-on-one matchups. However, he often relies more on raw power than refined technique, which can make him predictable against experienced offensive linemen.
Draft Network’s Damian Parson has him “Day-1 pick Pro Bowl Caliber” which is their highest designation short of #1 overall.
Overall, Graham projects best as a starting even front 3-technique defensive tackle. He can wreck offensive game plans due to his prowess versus the run and pass. Graham has the skill set and physical ability to become one of the best defensive linemen in the NFL.
Brian’s prediction for this year last year was “best DT in the country,” but Graham was arguably already that by the end of 2023. Every expectation for Graham that tries to be reasonable just adds to the long list of people who’ve been underrating this guy since they were ready to let him go play for Boise State.
So: Heisman. I mean the field is so wide open they have Dillon Gabriel #1. Drew Allar is on this list. If you search for Graham you find Graham Mertz. What are we even doing here? Mock if you want but this is where I’m at:
Mason Graham enters the 2024 season as the most outstanding player in college football, at the second-most important position. If you were around for the early blog days you still get a little angry that Ndamukong Suh didn’t get the award that still says “most outstanding” not “most valuable offensive” on it. But his Great Bambino impression is a bit off and his chin has another chin, so it’s possible that only the people who chart things, grade things, draft things, and pay things are going to give one of best players to ever come through Michigan his due.
THAAAAANKKK YOUUUUUUU!!!!!! [Barron]
Because Graham was such an instant sensation, there was some confusion over which defensive tackle Harbaugh meant when he said one of them is a “gift from the football gods.” He actually meant KENNETH GRANT, and over a more defensive tackle-appropriate timeline we got to see what happens when the pantheon that took control of Georgia Tech last week will come up with if you leave them in create-a-player mode during a pandemic.
If Graham isn’t the first Michigan player taken in the 2025 NFL Draft it’s because coaches are all raw tools people, and Grants’ have all the analysts cartoonishly thumping their chests then ascending with extended eyes and tongues while going AWWWWOOOGA! Tom Fornelli was literally palpitating.
Kenneth Grant, DL, Michigan: As does his teammate! Like Graham, Grant was a four-star prospect in the 2022 class who has developed into a monster at Michigan. He's a giant human being who is just as capable of picking you up and throwing you out of his way as he is chasing down a running back in the open field. Seriously, writing up these last five players has my heart racing about next year's defensive line class.
He made the Freaks List before he even played!
Herbert said one of the tests is a 26-inch high reactive plyo staircase, on which receiver Roman Wilson recently set a Wolverine record, going 2.21. Aidan Hutchinson did it in 2.57, which was flying. When Grant first started, he posted impressive times for his massive size, going as low as 3.2, but after a few weeks, he’s done it as fast as 2.77. “Everyone about fell over when they saw that,” Herbert said.
Feldman put true freshman KG at #46 and predicted he could be #1 in a couple of years. After a couple of years, well, he wasn’t #1 (sorry: Nyck Harbor exists) or #2 (Travis Hunter, people). But he was #3.
…Anyone doubting Grant’s speed (a max of 18.75 mph on the GPS) only needed to see him run down Penn State running back Kaytron Allen in the open field last year. His ability to fly up Michigan’s reactive plyo stairs test, a series of seven 26-inch-high stairs that players attempt to jump up as fast as possible, is truly freakish. This offseason, Grant pressed a 115-pound dumbbell 34 times on his right and 27 times on his left. He vertical-jumped 29 inches and did a Turkish get-up with a 150-pound dumbbell.
“Watching KG move is like a work of art,” said Justin Tress, Michigan’s director of strength and conditioning. “He plays and trains violent and explosive.”
I mentioned “freak of nature” Jordan Davis above because Michigan was doing the Davis thing with him, but Grant is the one football coaches will spend 28 minutes comparing to something between Davis and a god.
I will not ask you to watch the whole thing because these guys start talking about the Allen play and are still talking about that play after seventeen-and-a-half minutes. But that play is Kenneth Grant in a nutshell. His size and proportions mean he cannot be blocked, and then all of the other attributes are turned up to 99 like Jon Bois is trying to break the game.
Davis is a good comp for Grant as a man with defensive tackle proportions who can move like a linebacker. I used Johnathan Hankins, another 3-star who moved like his size said he shouldn’t:
Why Johnathan Hankins? ... Hankins was the definitive Not-Just-a-Plugger™, listed at 6'3"/335 coming out of Detroit Southeastern, and 6'3"/320 before the draft with ridiculous combine measurements for his size.
He made the rotation as a true freshman, was All-Big Ten and got at least one All-American nod as a junior, then was selected in the early part of the 2nd round after being projected to the middle of the 1st (while the Wolverines started Jibreel Black at nose).
But also:
Ceiling: Mammoth. You saw Jordan Davis of Georgia track down Blake Corum in the backfield.
Make the scouts go mad type, masochists we’re that type.
Lookit the big guy go. Can you imagine throwing a pick on a tunnel screen and then, moments later, being rudely greeted by Kenneth Grant?
DT #78 just above C
This is the DT equivalent of watching JJ McCarthy catch up to Blake Corum in the Big Ten championship game. That should not be so, but it is. 
Sherrone Moore doesn’t have to do much this year to make us happy after what he banked last year, but if we get through the season without at least one play Kenneth Grant at fullback I may have to take a break from the inner peace. It can be a pass play if he likes.
PASS RUSHING FREAK OF NATURE. When the NCAA videogame came back naturally it created mini-controversies over various player ratings; for example they made Kaytron Allen faster than Kenneth Grant.
The freakishness also works pretty well, you know, in a defensive line context. NOW you may look at the DT on the left.
Grant was, of course, the other 2022 recruit I was SO MAD about two sites (On3 slipped him into their top-100 late) making him a four-star, thus rendering him ineligible for Sleeper of the Year. That play above is why. For one he’s the first guy on the line who recognizes the shift to an unbalanced formation and initiates the check. His feet are so quick that the LG has to give ground to protect himself from getting run by, and then tries to get his hands outside Grant’s shoulders to cheat but can’t because Grant’s arms are so damn long. Then the power comes into play and another member of the Joe Moore winners (Nate Kalepo) ends up on his ass. Next we get that burst—THAT BURST!—which eats up all of the yards between the fallen guard and his quarterback before Penix can start rolling away. And then the length comes back into play because once he has his mitts on you you’re dead.
PFF thought Kalepo the best of Washington’s interior line, giving him a 46 (still bad). Kenneth Grant is their #6 returning interior lineman, and pointed at the pass rush for why:
The sophomore’s 78.4 PFF pass-rushing grade in 2023 was a top-15 mark among defensive tackles as well. With Jenkins gone, Grant should only shine more as a full-time starter next to Graham.    
Grant’s moves are so sudden, and his bull rush is so powerful on its own, that he often gets instant wins when he tries a thing like this spin move:
And when you combine that with another DT who can win consistently doubles and influence quarterbacks Grant can turn on that speed and athleticism to pay off a victory versus single-blocking in ways that most tackles cannot. This was particularly evident on last year’s line when Cam Goode was the third pass-rushing DT (Jenkins’s deployment was heavily slanted to standard downs) and would often break into the backfield only to come in out of control and whiff or have to stop and let them off with a throwaway.
And then there's Kenneth Grant.
Oh lawd! The contrast between the true sophomore Grant and the 6th year senior Cam Goode could not be made better than their combined sack. Goode takes the first shot, has some pretty nice get-off, and mostly ruins the play even if he didn't get Brumfield down. Then it's Grant's turn.
Look at how he stopped—how that knee took all the force of his movement—so he could approach under control. That's linebacker-movement, not 340-pound dude movement.
Grant routinely turns those same plays into Gus Johnson calls.
The greater the mismatch the more Grant’s freakish proportions amplify. His push-pull wasn’t as consistent as Graham’s last year, but when you put Grant against a guy with shorter arms (like most centers) the results are comical.
His acceleration also breaks the timers in quarterback heads. Penix just went down but this ECU quarterback thought he had at least 0.85 seconds before the suddenly unblocked 340-pound man could get to him, and when he realized that’s more like 0.25 seconds he has to abort the Lurking Sainristil safety protocols before launch:
What do you we do now?
I think you name some dudes and I talk about them.
Alan Branch.
I said he has to be on the team.
He was out there on Saturday.
Oh, you mean Kenneth Grant!
Yes: Alan Branch.
Michigan may have found a gift from the football gods indeed. After years of charting Mazi Smith I was not prepared for this rip move and ensuing acceleration that ruined the rare ECU dropback opportunity.
He did this multiple times. And we already mentioned Grant's role in the Sainristil interception but I don't mind watching it again just to mentally clock how fast this 350 pound man is moving.
I made fun of ECU's guard for not blocking him but that is fast. When this much dude is coming at you that quickly it has a quality of its own.
ALSO RUN BLOCKING FREAK OF NATURE.
My assessment of the Rose Bowl was that Grant beating up the center (who’s now Ohio State’s best lineman) was such a sure thing that both teams were gameplanning around it.
Alabama's been losing that single block between the center (#56) and Grant all game. Michigan's run defense is predicated on their tackles owning these opportunities to cross a single block while the free linebacker comes into the gap behind. The surety of losing that single-block is why you can't release linemen on Michigan's LBs.
This was in the context of congratulating the subtle brilliance of Nick Saban on their big touchdown run for putting a linebacker in the wrong gap then using an ISO block to double Grant. Once I got onto the 3rd & 1 that needed a friendly spot I was sounding like a YouTube football guy.
we need to talk about Kenneth Grant making his case for an All-American shield. First-off that 3rd & 1 was a stuff. Second, the reason it was a stuff was because Kenneth Grant got his helmet between a double that couldn't move him, whereupon Grant's shoulderpad met Milroe's head, the ball met Grant's chest, and Grant refused to bend either by an inch.
This is the ball's most forward progression.
That's a tough call for the refs, not overturnable, and too unlikely to be repeated on a 4th & short sneak to be all that mad about, but it's a play that Kenneth Grant made by being Gabe Watsonesque. To get your 380-pound planetary nose-type plays out of the same guy who pass rushes like a 280-pound dervish is the kind of luxury usually reserved for the buy-a-championship outfits of the SEC.
Grant was the other half of Michigan’s plan to win back numbers in the secondary by taking them from the box because if you don’t use four guys on Grant and Graham you are outnumbered.
His classmate Kenneth Grant is in the star category now too. The draft guys are going to go ga-ga over him, not just because he runs down top-25 running backs in the open field, but because of what happens when you leave your double.
#78 bottom DT
If we go back to the scoop and score, which featured an unblocked Derrick Moore and a looping Michael Barrett, we find Moore was left alone in part because two linemen decided they needed to be focused on Grant.
Like Graham and Jenkins, Grant is a key part of Michigan's designs on playing Stretch with a light box by having their DTs get across the formation and force cutbacks. You can have the backside blocker release, but someone will just fill in behind. Or you can release the playside blocker and Grant will just run out in front and collect the TFL himself.
#78 nose
This is where the length comes into play again. Holding is a part of football and almost never gets called when you have both shoulders because it feels like justice if the offensive lineman can get squared up enough to be in position to do that. When your arms are just that much longer than the guys blocking you however, you cannot be held this way. That’s why it appears like he goes from being blocked to NOT BLOCKED so quickly. You think he is scooped, and then he hops around you like a 340-pound linebacker and now he is not scooped.
The agility and length are just killer against stretches, and the ability to just dodge a downblock is just killer against power.
So what do you do? Try Graham?
MAYBE YOU LOCK HIM OFF THE FIELD. Even if he’s progressed from a conditioning standpoint, and even if we’re grading on a “Mazi Smith ultimately played 60% of snaps” curve for anybody Ben Herbert’s had his hands on, Grant is not going to be able to stay on the field for 75% of a game.

Compared to his compatriot Grant had an age-appropriate number of flubs. Double-teams he couldn’t just rip through would sometimes get him moving despite the size because he’s playing high and trying to rip by instead of just plug a hole. You want him doing this, because the payoff for eating a six-yard gain here and there is a four-yard loss on the next series.
Yeah, this was the breakout game. You've got the highlight moment when the NFL Draft music chimes, but you've also got the regular ol' plays he makes where he teleports through the center and starts eating things in the backfield.
#78 DT to the top
Or when his speed and power combine to slam down the back of your stretch play far sooner than your scout team prepared you for.
DT at the bottom
At 339 pounds! We already saw his pass-rushing earlier this season, and in this one he was getting starter snaps. In fact Grant was on the field one more snap than Kris Jenkins. He's one of the starters now.
Not that he doesn't make mistakes. Grant still got moved a couple of times by downblocks by getting too high. This is something that happens to all DTs—there's an example of it happening to Graham as well—but it's a bit too frequent still to call Grant NFL-ready. He's going to factor against Ohio State for certain, and combine with Graham to form the best duo in the league next year.
Gifts from the gods.
MAYBE YOU LOCK HIM OFF THE FIELD. Even if he’s progressed from a conditioning standpoint, and even if we’re grading on a “Mazi Smith ultimately played 60% of snaps” curve for anybody Ben Herbert’s had his hands on, Grant is not going to be able to stay on the field for 75% of a game. The other difference in the charting above between the superstar DTs is Grant didn’t have the volume of snaps. Graham was the starter next to Jenkins, but even when Grant ascended late in the season they had to make sure they kept him fresh. He was getting visibly frustrated on Ohio State’s one running drive because they were getting away with some grabs, but I mentioned Grant usually just shrugs those off.
His best weapon against this is himself. When he’s going, Grant has an ability on par with Graham’s for creating the kind of havoc plays that knock drives off track. There’s going to be a drive a game where the opponent has some neat trick planned and then locks Grant on the field with tempo, and the immortal stats will come down to something the videogame’s engine can process.
LFG. The more normalized development track (that’s still well ahead of normal) for Grant means he likely has more runway than Graham. Expect a year that grades out like Mason Graham’s 2023 with a draft highlight package for the ages, and years of therapy for Michigan fans who’ve had their expectations for defensive tackle recruiting blown all out of proportion by the gods’ (still welcome, VERY VERY welcome) intervention.
It is wrong to wish he was wearing a club but there we are. [Barron]
Another man who spent the offseason fending off lucrative tampering attempts, RAYSHAUN BENNY [recruiting profile] was MGoBlog’s idea of a very good Michigan defensive tackle recruit before that concept got blown to smithereens by the class that came after him. Benny was a well-known entity around metro-Detroit, a solid four-star that Ohio State was recruiting for offensive line, and who committed to Mel Tucker for a brief moment after the 2021 upset, but was otherwise always expected to end up at Michigan. He redshirted in 2021, got in scattered snaps in 2022, and made his way into the rotation in 2023 in preparation for a much-expanded role in his upperclassman years. In an alternate universe where Michigan’s best DT was Kris Jenkins and Rayshaun Benny is stepping into those shoes as a redshirt sophomore we still feel pretty fine about defensive tackle. It is where Chris Hinton was going into 2021: still a lot of promise, some understandable mistakes of youth, a handful of really nice plays to hint at a very good future, etc.
Heady, lengthy, agile, and large, I predicted he would become the kind of upperclassman DT that MSU used to specialize in that exists to make zone—every football team’s favorite play—a negative proposition. With Graham out with a broken hand, Nebraska was the first to test my theory.
Here's Benny gently placing a guard out of the way while Stewart wrenches a TE to the ground to bait and close a frontside gap the RB had to cut to because Derrick Moore blew up the intended backside gap.
#26 the DT on the bottom hash
Benny’s length was also relevant in that game when he got one of those ridiculous arms up and batted a pass back to the quarterback
I’ve seen those plays a thousand times and usually they result in pop-ups, but Benny’s extra length turns it into one of the season’s weirder moments. In a different context a ball that would normally go over the DT’s fingertips is going to end up in another lineman’s hands (PLEASE let it be Kenneth Grant’s).
That kind of player usually ends up being most effective as a 3-4 DE or off-tackle in a 4-man front, and that’s where Benny is projected to play after a year spent as understudy to Kris Jenkins. That was going well enough to project the kind of RS sophomore breakout that the norm around here before the football gods reset our expectations. The agility and intelligence here to realize when Purdue was trying to feck with him was Advanced.
This also meant Benny was getting less playing time than Goode, and still learning on the job as late as Penn State.
Before this game we projected Rayshaun Benny to end up in the backups pile, getting a drive or two when the others were winded. He did only get 14 snaps, but boy did he make hay with them. The one where he caused the fumble wasn't just that—he was shrugging off a double-team and fighting through a hold when he did it.
The other development was Benny reacting appropriately when Michigan slanted across a blockdown. Previous iterations of Benny were flowing or stopping to figure out why he wasn't being blocked. Benny of this week twisted to make sure the blocker couldn't fix his mistake, set up in the backfield, and let the play come to him.
DT just above the hash
Benny did get washed down by a double on a couple of PSU's big gains, but on one of them he kept the linebacker clean to replace him, which earns points in our book.
The following week I thought I detected a light going on.
Behind them, we saw more progress from their backups. Benny had another great outing without any of the slip-ups that was characterizing his play earlier in the season. I loved this play both for his get-off, and how he fought through the double-team to pop up in the running lane just in time.
#26 bottom DT
He too showed an ability to two-gap on light box run plays. When Jenkins moves on the position isn't taking much of a step back.   
Benny also showed promise as a pass-rusher, again the length being the thing that makes him tough to control with single-blocking
#26 the DT on top
Alternate universe Benny and recruit Benny are still relevant because of The Gifts but also because Jenkins was taking standard downs in a platoon with passing downs Cam Goode, which meant Benny was relegated to drives when the others were gassed (and Graham doesn’t get gassed).

In this universe Benny is the kind of luxury that is becoming vanishingly rare in college football: a THIRD impact defensive tackle. Michigan will use him in their 5-2 sets as a 4-3 under SDE in addition to having Benny rotate in for Graham (who will use some of those snaps at nose). It will look like a dropoff from the starters, but not that much of one.
BROKEN LEG? OH MAN. Benny spent the offseason rehabbing but was able to start going by the middle of fall camp. As of Sherrone’s update four days ago he’s back.
He’s been awesome. He came back, and you never know with a foot or an ankle how it could be. And, I mean, it’s like nothing really happened. Dude’s been — we’ve been trying to just progress him. And he gets mad at us, me sometimes, like, hey, yeah, that’s good. He said, ‘No, I want more. I want more.’ So he’s been great.
The greater concern I have is that Benny gave up a pair of –2s to Alabama blockers before (or in the second case perhaps during) the injury. Where The Gifts were making Joe Moore winners look like Spartans and Saban’s blue chips look overrated, Benny was a decent litmus test for offensive lines. Penn State, Nebraska, Maryland, Indiana: these were not great OL.
The longer you stare the bigger he looks. [David Wilcomes]
I am very sorry but I have to get on the road to Chicago so I have to go light on the backup DTs (/shakes other foot at DTE). Michigan may have to as well, since the next hype-getter is summer DE-convert/RS freshman ENOW ETTA [recruiting profile]. The good news is the hype for Etta isn’t new. His recruiting profile was filled with the usual reasons for a guy to be underrated by the services: immigrant, nobody could get him in camps, demolishing lower-level competition. Also nobody could tell if he was 220 or 300.
Weights for Etta are actually all over the place, and sometimes nonsensical. He was listed at 260 to On3 when he committed, and that was updated to 220 at some point in the last few months. And before you take the most recent weight as gospel, Michigan said 270 when they published their Signing Day roster at the same time. Chris Singletary noted a 40-pound weight gain between March 2021 and 2022 to get to 260 at the point last summer when most of the scouting came in, including Singletary's.
This continued at Michigan. Etta was up to 295 in last year’s fall phonebooks, and added another 13 for this year’s. What stood out from previous Chris Wormleys was Etta could move like Ojabo. This was EJ Holland’s take after seeing high school Etta in-person($):
The first thing that pops out about Etta is his speed. Etta is extremely quick off the ball and was in the backfield in what seemed like half a second. The opposing offensive tackle stood zero chance. Etta is also very nimble and moves well for his size, which is why I mentioned that I wanted to see him on offense. Etta has a soccer and basketball background, and you can definitely see that in his feet. I also likes the way Etta uses his hands and length. He can still develop more pass rushing moves, but they aren’t really needed at this level. Etta can basically dominate the man in front of him with his sheer strength and power. I actually liked that he showed some versatility as opposed to just bull rushing.
Large person who moves very fast, needs to learn football. As of the Rose Bowl word was this had begun to translate into Michigan’s next Heavy edge, with talk in early spring putting Etta on a level with TJ Guy as respective backups to Derrick Moore and Josaiah Stewart who were going to allow Wink to reprise the kind of rotation that made last year’s defense such a menace. Stewart on Etta:
His tenacity off the edge, his strength, his size — it's different from some of the guys in the room," Stewart said. "He's more of a bulky guy, so when guys come at him, they think power. But this year he's been working on his finesse moves and whatnot and rounding out his game."
Then a bunch of DTs were unavailable in spring and Etta had to move inside. Esposito on the early returns:
He's a really, really good athlete. It's just that he has to learn. As you get closer to the ball, the hand combat becomes quicker. It gets on you faster. The further away from the ball, it kind of takes a little bit of time and you can use your athletic ability out there. I think the biggest thing with him is getting some of those inside reps has really helped him on the edge. Now when you put him on the edge, some of the weaknesses that he had he doesn't have anymore in the physicality part. He's been extremely physical all spring, and he's a big part of what we're gonna do moving forward.
An insider thought Etta's "a little too trim" for this. "He's got big legs. No butt though."
My analysis of the spring game was this did not go very well, to the point where I wasn’t able to get a good read on the interior OL. Since Etta put on an additional 13 pound to reach 308 by the fall roster, Brian was all aboard with the DT move. Alex’s last football bits picked up a ton of signals that Etta is Happening™ but unfortunately mixed in with positive reviews of guys lost on the depth chart, that
Next up on the depth chart may well be Enow Etta, who made a positional change from EDGE to DT and is reaping the benefits. Grant mentioned Etta and Trey Pierce as names impressing publicly, and Sam claims to have heard the same about Etta in discussions with both Graham/Grant ($). A separate insider noted Michigan feels good about its depth at DT, in reference to Etta and Pierce ($) and further buzz came for Etta, along with a surprising shoutout for Ike Iwunnah, who has been seldom heard from since arriving in Ann Arbor ($).
Whether the vibe here leans more towards KRIS JENKINS COMIN IN HOT (Brian) or BEN MASON BUT HE’S THE 4TH DT NOT THE STARTER (Seth) is in the eye of the beholder. Etta had nine snaps last year, and was on the shelf by the time Harbaugh had finished serving his (first) suspension not remembering if he bought two burgers at Benny’s. If Etta gets to come on as a situational pass-rusher he could give them what they got from Goode last year: a lot of havoc for someone else to clean up. The fact that they’re dying to get him on the field suggests the future is bright.
The player I assume is *functionally* the next DT after Benny is true sophomore TREY PIERCE [recruiting profile]. Where Etta is a wild card, the arrows have been pointing steadily up for Pierce since he first flipped from Wisconsin. When I looked at him I saw the kind of guy Old Wisconsin would always get at nose: steady, stalwart, smart, superhumanly immune to our Freshman DTs Suck metric because of an explosive first step:
The UW Rivals guy loved the "burst and agility." Their Athletic guy said Pierce was an easy scout because he "already possesses explosiveness and power." In bumping him, 247 scout Cooper Petagna noted the "explosive first step" and called Pierce "nimble for his size, and athletic." Chris Singletary called Pierce an "active big man with the requisite agility, well-coached, and should be a good run defender."
And hey I actually managed to clip a +2 event from him because I was having too much fun to stop charting the MSU game. Uh, caveat Michigan State.
We also got to see him get off a block and hop over a lot more ground than it looks like from this angle to close down an escape lane. I was enthused:
But the guy who was standing out was Trey Pierce. I was all about this guy in his recruiting writeup and suggested he might be able to pass Cam Goode this year. That was underrating Cam Goode, but Pierce definitely looks like a find.
Expectation for this year is Pierce steps up as a study/strong option to spell Grant for three or four drives a game, grades out 2-to-1 to the positive, and is your starting nose in 2025. Again, in a different universe this doesn’t sound remotely disappointing.
Options past these two…are the other reason I’m skeptical of Etta. As best I can tell the walk-on-with-a-story CHIBI ANWUNAH, another grow-a-bear project they moved from edge in spring, is the best shot at a darkhorse contributor. The other guy who flashed a bit when they were putting anyone who'd volunteer against a mix of first-teamers and freshmen was JOEY KLUNDER. A Grosse Pointe teammate of Will Johnson, Klunder right now is a bit of an undersized tryhard—think Jesse Speight. Other options are true freshmen, of whom they might be able to get some bowling ball freshman play out of OWEN WAFLE [recruiting profile], who’s kind of a Grant Bowman, but we’re really rooting for an appearance from DEYVID PALEPALE [recruiting profile], who was Sleeper of the Year:
but hear me out: He's already 335 pounds on the roster. He was playing in Anchorage, Alaska before moving *UP* for high school to a league in the Pennsylvania back country. He didn't get a chance to move up further because he got kicked off his very bad team for a social media post about the coaches. Yes, dumb, but not exclusionary.
Did I mention (I did) he's cousins with Penei Sewell, who is the reigning freakiest big man athlete in the NFL right now? Or that he trains in the offseason with his cousin's NFL friends? Thank you thank you thank you to all of the sites who missed on this guy.
Nobody has said anything about numens with Palepale but he recently enrolled and has a big step up in competition, so there wouldn’t be. Etta’s move and the rest of the spring takes mean it’s well past late early for projects IKE IWUNNAH and ALESSANDRO LORENZETTI, of whom Ike is the only one getting mention at the end of “we mention everybody” coach sessions.

I mean this has to be one of the most fun things I have ever read. Some of the OMG clips had me involuntarily saying OMG to myself and laughing out loud. Holy hell I cannot wait to see the absolute havoc this line creates. How do you run on this team with those DTs? How do you pass on this team with those DTs and half of the field taken away by Will F'ing Johnson? I'm beyond excited for the season to start just so there are even more absurd DT clips to watch over and over

Should we do the Mo Hurst thing where we put Grant on the B-team so whatever D-line opponents try to lock onto the field with tempo, there's always an All-American DT to deal with?  I remember that working pretty well.
I mean, drives when they both play are going to be pretty short, but our offense might not stay on the field as well as when J.J. McCarthy was extending drives.

The reason I wasn’t fully on board with Brian’s vibe to not play football anymore is because I wanted to watch Mason Graham play football for Michigan again.
He could be the best DT we’ve ever had.
I’d be down for a Suh-like Heisman push. It would take some lucky breaks, but then, Mason makes his own breaks.
After an offensive section with RBs and a TE and a bunch of question marks, DL day is an absolute dream.

I don't trust those blithering Heisman idiot voters to understand the ludicrously difficult things Michigan asks of Graham.  He's going to take on triple-teams with regularity this season and those nitwits are going to cluck that he didn't get enough sacks.

If the geniuses who run the Heisman foundation had any wits they'd acknowledge that two-platoon football has been the norm for over 60 years at both the college and professional level, which is a distinctly different state of affairs from when the Heisman was originally created. There should be an offensive Heisman and a defensive Heisman.

Oh I had every intention of heeding your caution but then got completely sucked in and had to watch the whole thing.  They spent nearly 30 minutes just reviewing two plays by Grant.  Loved it.

Things that amaze me:

3 - The commitment of the writers on this blog FOLLOWING the greatest season we're ever going to experience.
No letdown whatsoever from Seth/Brian/Alex et al., and I sincerely appreciate it.

Yes, I used to have to cut my essays to fit under the max length, but that's my writing style. I used to struggle with bluebooks because my best way of writing is to put it all down then edit it all down. A lot of times what I'll do is write a few notes of what I want to be in a paragraph then go back and fill it in. Other times I have a turn of phrase I am particularly enamored with. But usually I'll take the section's main idea and build from it. Entire paragraphs often become a few words in sentence. Writing is not about wasting peoples' time. It's about expressing ideas in a way that others have easy access to them.

Thank you, Seth! Never have I ever read a position group preview that instills such a great sense of confidence and excitement, as well as…
…a sense of sadness that this will be the last year we will witness the greatest DT duo in program history. I’ve witnessed some good duo’s throughout my fandom (Carr-Horne, Renes-Williams, Taylor-Branch, Henry-Glasgow, Hurst-Glasgow [which was a very close second place]), but none at this level of pure dominance
‘25-onward will bring our DT play back down to mortal levels, so I will relish and be grateful for what’s in store this year from this group
