Billie Eilish closed 2023 teasing the arrival of her next album. Now, we’ve got photographic evidence of her working on new music.
In an Instagram post, Eilish shares a picture of her in a recording studio, wearing headphones and sitting in front of a microphone. In the caption, she writes, “another january” alongside a yawning emoji.
Eilish’s most recent album is her 2021 sophomore effort, Happier Than Ever. In a December interview on The Tonight Show, Eilish teased that her upcoming third record is “almost done.” Her brother and collaborator, FINNEAS, later put a number on their progress, sharing that the album is “85% done.”
Even without releasing an album, Eilish had a big 2023 thanks to her ﻿Barbie﻿ single, “What Was I Made For?” In addition to being nominated for a number of film awards, “What Was I Made For?” is also up for several Grammys, including Song and Record of the Year.
