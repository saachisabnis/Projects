The pair performed one of Cabello's own songs, 'I Luv It'
Lana Del Rey brought out Camila Cabello during her performance at the second weekend of Coachella – check it out below.
The pair teamed up to perform one of Cabello’s hits, ‘I Luv It’, with Cabello performing a high-energy dance routine among a slew of backing dancers while Del Rey remained on the balcony on stage. It provided a rather unexpected moment during Del Rey’s set, with fans expecting Billie Eilish to return after her guest spot last weekend or Taylor Swift to appear following the release of her highly anticipated album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’. 
“I need you to make some motherfucking noise if you love Lana Del Rey with all your motherfucking heart!” announced Cabello as she took to the stage.
Later, Del Rey said: “I had so much fun with her, I love this girl to bits,” later adding: “Thank you for bringing the energy.”

Elsewhere, Del Rey’s headline set has run much smoother this week after she experienced significant microphone issues during weekend one of the desert festival.
Last week, Del Rey also shared the stage with Jon Batiste and Jack Antonoff, both of whom returned to perform with her again this weekend.
Meanwhile, earlier this week, Del Rey hit out at her ex-tour manager while also revealing she had only recovered from laryngitis “a few hours” beforehand.
In a lengthy social media post, Del Rey alleged that her previous tour manager “quit for no reason” just 37 days before the set, after being “butt hurt” that she had been able to acquire a motorcade of 10 motorcycles for her viral entrance to the stage.
During a list of tributes to the team behind organising the set, Del Rey takes a moment to thank “Emily for stepping up as tour manager when Pete quit for no reason after 15 years because he was butt hurt that I got 10 comped bikes for free from Wally and randomly decided he was more of a stage designer than a tour manager”.
Del Rey continued: “Never got a phone call probably never will. Still grateful for the 15 years though. No worries – 37 days was more than enough time to put together an entire headlining set all by ourselves. Not stressful at all. Way to go Emily you fucking killed it with grace.”
In the same post, Del Rey also revealed that she had been suffering from laryngitis ahead of the show, even saying that it only cleared in the hours leading up to her taking the stage.
She thanked her band “for just killing it and spending months in Sylmar in a 40° warehouse to the point but it was so cold that I caught laryngitis that literally left just a few hours before I hit the stage because Tessa DiPietro spent two hours lifting that cough remotely through her body intuitive skills just minutes before showtime”.
In a four-star review of Lana’s Coachella set, NME wrote: “Some festival-goers and critics have pointed to Del Rey as an “odd” choice of headliner – someone not exactly known for putting in energetic, flashy performances. Tonight, unswayed by those opinions, she sticks to what is true to her and instead focuses on something artful rather than gimmicky.”
