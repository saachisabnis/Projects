• DJ Nelson, a master of dropping beats, is set to perform Friday at 8 p.m. at the Santander Arena in Reading. DJ Nelson played a crucial role in reggaeton’s development. He was a core member of the Noise, a collective of DJs, MCs, producers and club coordinators. “The Flow,” his 1997 debut mixtape-style album, was followed by work with Ivy Queen, Wisin & Yandel and others. His 2003 offering “Mas Flow” with young guns Noriega and Luny Tunes remains influential. 2007’s “Flow La Discoteka Vol. 2” netted the Hot 100 hit single, “Pasarela.” 2019’s “Platonicos” with Jay Wheeler charted across the Latin pop spectrum. In 2022 he released the star-studded two-volume “De Camino a Palomino.” Ticket prices start at $40. For more information, go to santander-arena.com/events/.

• The Wood Brothers with Lindsay Lou are set to perform Sunday at 8 p.m. at The Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville. The Wood Brothers have learned to trust their hearts. For the better part of two decades, they’ve cemented their reputation as freethinking songwriters, road warriors and community builders, creating a catalog of diverse music and a loyal audience who’ve grown alongside them. That evolution continues with “Heart is the Hero,” the band’s eighth studio album. Recorded analog to 16-track tape, this latest effort finds its three creators embracing the chemistry of their acclaimed live shows by capturing their performances in real-time direct from the studio floor with nary a computer in sight. An acoustic-driven album that electrifies, “Heart is the Hero” is stocked with songs that target not only the heart, but the head and hips, too. With this new vision of womanhood in mind, Lou began to see a throughline from her grandmother, to herself, to the art she was creating. Her 2018 release, “Southland” (recorded with her former band, The Flatbellys), felt like the first chapter to a greater story that was unfolding; with this release, the theme deepened. Lou’s vocals are a powerful companion to her songwriting. Ticket prices start at $50. For more information, see thecolonialtheatre.com/events/.
• Nini Iris with Paloma Dineli Chesky are set to perform Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Sellersville Theater in Sellersville. Featured on Billboard, People and NBC’s “The Voice” in Season 24, Iris astounded millions with her haunting rendition of Billie Eilish’s “No Time To Die,” her power ballad version of The Cure’s “Lovesong” and wowed audiences and fans with her show-stopping cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police.” Born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia, Iris grew up listening to only traditional Georgian folk music. While living in Georgia, she auditioned and performed for Georgia’s “XFactor” and “The Voice,” where she placed as a top 3 finalist. Almost a decade later, she auditioned for NBC’s “The Voice” and placed in the top 9. Iris’ unique writing and singing style delivers an old world charm combined with dark textured overtones, with an aggressive pop edge. Every one of her performances are personal and powerful. Iris’ eclectic songwriting and powerhouse vocals leave fans and listeners at dizzy heights. Dineli Chesky is a unique young, Brazilian-American artist. She is not only a powerful performer who dominates the stage and electrifies her audience, but she is also an incredible songwriter. Despite her youth, her vocal maturity is astonishing. Singing, playing piano and composing from a very early age, for several years Dineli Chesky has performed her own compositions with the New York Philharmonic and has held solo concerts at leading NYC venues such as City Winery, Birdland and Dizzy’s Club. She is a fierce performer with a stage presence that is contagious. Ticket prices start at $25. For more information, go to st94.com/events/.
