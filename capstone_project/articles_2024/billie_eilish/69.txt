The concert film that is streaming on Disney+ also includes additional songs the version that played in cinemas last year did not have.

Taylor Swift has smashed a Disney+ viewing record with her Eras Tour film, which was released on Mar 14. 
According to The Walt Disney Company, the concert garnered 4.6 million views and 16.2 million hours on Disney+ in its opening weekend. A view is defined as total stream time divided by runtime.
This is also the streamer's number one music film ever, beating hit films from The Beatles and Billie Eilish, as well as a previous movie from the 34-year-old Swift herself.
Swift's three-and-a-half-hour movie featured performances of new songs not featured in the theatrical release of the movie – including Cardigan and four acoustic tunes: Maroon, Death By A Thousand Cuts, You Are In Love and I Can See You.
The film also grossed nearly US$262 million (S$351.6 million) worldwide at the global box office.
It outperformed other hit music films released on Disney+ such as 22-year-old Eilish’s Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter To Los Angeles; Elton John’s Elton John: Farewell From Dodger Stadium; Black Is King: A Film by Beyonce, as well as The Beatles: Get Back and Swift’s 2020 movie Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions.
Swift recently delighted fans in Singapore when she announced the fourth and final version of her upcoming album The Tortured Poets Department, due out on Apr 19.
An image of the new version of the record, featuring previously unseen artwork of the singer – who is dating 34-year-old NFL star Travis Kelce – running her hands through her hair appeared behind her on stage, and it was also revealed a bonus track titled The Black Dog will be included in the latest edition of the album.
Swift also posted the news on Instagram, which came a day after she shared a glimpse into her own family ties with Singapore.
During her first sold-out show at Singapore National Stadium earlier this month, she reflected on the childhood of her mum, Andrea Swift. The Karma singer said during the concert: “My mom actually spent a lot of her childhood with her mom and dad and sister growing up in Singapore.
“So a lot of the time when we’d come here on tour, my mom would take me and drive me past her old house, where she used to go to school so I’ve been hearing about Singapore my whole life.
“To get to come here and play a show this big with so many beautiful, generous people who are essentially honouring my family with what you just did with that song, it means the world."
