They discussed Gunna, who'd seen his career hit new heights despite admitting his label was a criminal organization, suggesting that controversy actually boosts an artist's popularity. They went on to discuss the case of BG, who's facing allegations of snitching during a gun charge trial. Other rap personalities like Wack 100 and Birdman have been vocal about the case.

They further commented on how this whole controversy improved BG's image, providing him with a storyline that attracted fans' attention.
