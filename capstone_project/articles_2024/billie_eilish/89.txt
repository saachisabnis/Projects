Billie Eilish is absolutely stunned that her "idol" not only wants to work with her, but is starstruck by her!
The "LUNCH" star sat down with Complex on Thursday (December 5), detailing exactly how she felt when Rihanna said she wanted to make music with her. 
In October, RiRi told Access Hollywood that she wanted to collab with Eilish, and that she couldn't believe the hitmaker knew her. 
 "If I could only do a song with Billie Eilish."
The "Diamonds" songstress continued: 
Upon hearing a second time that Rihanna wanted to work with her, the "bury a friend" standout quipped: 
 "'Well, b----, I've been sitting here this whole time!' What the f--- is she even talking about? Honestly. What do you mean, 'If only?!' It's, like, as if I've been saying, 'No.' Rihanna! Riri!? I'll literally do anything you want. That's insane."
Will 2025 be the year for a Billie Eilish, Rihanna collab? Here's to hoping!
