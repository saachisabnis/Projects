As confirmed via Gay Times, boygenius discussed their indefinite hiatus during an interview in the winner's room at the Grammy Awards on Sunday evening. 
Last week, rumours were circulating that Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, had subtly announced their hiatus on-stage at an LA show, ahead of the Grammys. Footage shared online saw Dacus explaining, “This is our last show, and we’re feeling it.”⁠
⁠Gay Times now reports that following their hat-trick at the Grammys – earning the award of Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance and Best Alternative Music Album – Bridgers addressed their hiatus head-on. “This is funny because I guess we just didn’t tell anybody, but we told each other at the beginning of this project that it will have a finite date, like a finite amount of time devoted to it. And we completed that time, and now we’ve walked into the sunset.”⁠

Baker continued: “It feels nice to have a cap on what we’ve done, we put the record into the world and that’s enough," with Dacus adding: “That’s why we’ve been showing up and working so hard, we knew that we didn’t have to sustain it and this was our chance so glad we took it".
boygenius made their debut at End of the Road Festival in 2018, and subsequently released their debut album last year, along with the follow-up EP, the rest, as well as a short film directed by Kristen Stewart, and collaborations with the likes of MUNA, Lorde, Billie Eilish, Dave Grohl, and Hayley Williams, both on and off-stage. 
boygenius currently have no plans for a reunion in the future.
