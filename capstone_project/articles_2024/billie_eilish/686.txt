The Celebrity Beat…
Billie Eilish picked up Best TV Performance for her role in Swarm at the People’s Choice Awards on Sunday, but she wasn’t thrilled about the guest list at the ceremony.
In a clip circulating on social media, Eilish is seen sitting at a table with Kylie Minogue when she leans over and appeared to whisper: “There’s some like… TikTokers here.” She put her hand over her mouth when she said “TikToker” and discreetly pointed them out to Minogue. She then visibly shakes her head and says something like, “I don’t need it.”
It’s not clear who she was referring to, but there were plenty of influencers at the event, including Tana Mongeau, Chris Olsen, Gigi Gorgeous, Alix Earle, James Charles, and Bryce Hall among others.
Bryce Hall heard about it and he had something to say.  He sarcastically apologized for not acknowledging Billie’s greatness and bowing down to her.
He also told her to hate on People’s Choice Awards because they’re the ones that personally invited him and the others, and that he’s disappointed because he was a Billie “stan” and won’t be able to use her music anymore.
