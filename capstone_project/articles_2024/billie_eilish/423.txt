On this version of HotÂ off the Wire:
Thousands of homes and businesses are without power as severe weather roars through several states, causing at least one death and spawning possible tornados. A strong weather system in northeastern Oklahoma with heavy rains produced three suspected tornadoes. The storms were blamed for the death of a 46-year-old homeless woman in Tulsa who died inside a drainage pipe. In Ohio, firefighters rescued two people who were trapped under a bridge when the waters of an Ohio river began rising. Meanwhile in Wisconsin, a spring snowstorm was expected to drop more than a foot of snow.

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A new poll finds that most Americans share many core values on what it means to be an American despite the countryâ€™s deep political polarization. The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 9 in 10 U.S. adults say the right to vote, the right to equal protection under the law and the right to privacy are important or very important to the U.S.â€™s identity as a nation.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Donald Trump is suing two co-founders of Trump Media & Technology Group, the newly public parent company of his Truth Social platform, arguing that they should forfeit their stock in the company because they set it up improperly. The former presidentâ€™s lawsuit, which was filed on March 24, follows a complaint filed in February by Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who asked a Delaware court to block Trump from taking steps the two said would sharply reduce their 8.6% stake in Trump Media.
ISTANBUL (AP) â€” A deadly fire that spread through an Istanbul nightclub during renovations was likely caused by welding sparks coming into contact with combustible material, Turkish news reports say.
