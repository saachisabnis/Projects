Charli XCX announced Sunday evening that, defying all scientific logic and theological suppositions, the summer is about to get even brattier. The extended release of Brat dropped at midnight, gifting us with “Hello goodbye,” “Guess,” at long last, “Spring Breakers,” and, most importantly, fresh meme content. Someone tell Mike’s Mic neyow! So, mean girls, let’s take a 360 look into the memes that became the apple of our eye, the fan cams that were so confusing, the posts on X we’ll be “talk talk”-ing about for the next 365 days, and TikToks that we’ll rewind and think about all the time.
