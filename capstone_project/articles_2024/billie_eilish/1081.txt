	For those looking for a Baccarat Rouge 540 dupe, TikTok might have found it. According to the brand, Fine’ry The New Rouge smells like golden saffron, amber resin and sandalwood. This is a vegan and cruelty-free, affordable and high-quality fragrance. One Target customer said, “Love it, it is similar to rouge 540! Scent is long-lasting!”

	If you’re looking for a vanilla-scented fragrance for the summer, you might want to consider adding this Fine’ry: Sweet on the Outside Perfume to your collection. According to the brand, it smells like a combination of Madagascar vanilla, cacao wood and smoked vetiver. TikTok calls it the Billie Eilish perfume dupe. One Target customer said, “Such a good vanilla!! Super long lasting, not overly sweet or artificial. Smells like tonka, marshmallow, and things of gourmand nature. Great for the price too.”

	For those who want to smell like a bouquet of flowers this summer, you might want to consider this Fine’ry Flower Bed Fragrance. According to the brand it smells like lush peony, green apple and wild bamboo leaves. This perfume is clean, vegan and cruelty-free. “This has become my favorite scent! Whenever I wear it I get complimented. It never fails that someone will ask me what I’m wearing. It’s a soft feminine fresh scent. It also has floral notes in there. I love it. I buy 2 at a time…,” said a Target customer. 

	For those looking for a date-night fragrance, but also one that you could use throughout the day, consider this Fine’ry Midnight Cafe Perfume. According to the brand, it smells like crème de café, jasmine and patchouli. With its long-lasting scent, you can’t go wrong. “Excellent dupe for Black Opium! Love these Fine’ry fragrances and this one is no different. Excellent projection and longevity… I’d say it lasts at least 4 hours on me, and it’s small (and affordable) enough to tuck in a bag for a respray,” said a Target customer. 

	










	This Fine’ry Pistachio Please fragrance has everyone talking on TikTok. According to the brand, it has notes of Pistachio Milk, Fluffy Vanilla, and Tonka Bean. If you are a fan of the Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato fragrance, it’s possible you’ll also like this dupe. Target customers describe it as a “creamy” and “fresh” option.
