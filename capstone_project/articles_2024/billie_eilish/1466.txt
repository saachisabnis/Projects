Pop star Billie Eilish criticized fellow musicians who release multiple vinyl editions in an interview released Thursday by Billboard.
“We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it’s very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging … which ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money and gets them more …” Eilish said in the interview.
“I can’t even express to you how wasteful it is,” Eilish later added. “It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable.”
Eilish also said in the Billboard interview that it is “irritating” to her that “we’re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money — and it’s all your favorite artists doing that sh-t.”
In 2021, the Music Climate Pact, which requires committing to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, was launched. The pact has received the signatures of important groups and businesses in the music world like Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. The chief financial officer of Warner Music Group at the time said in a statement that “[t]he scale of the global climate crisis demands that we work together to make real impact.”
“We appointed a dedicated ESG [Environmental, Social & Governance] leader earlier this year, and committed to releasing Warner’s first annual ESG report next year, which will help us hold ourselves accountable and transparently communicate progress to our stakeholders,” Lou Dickler said.
