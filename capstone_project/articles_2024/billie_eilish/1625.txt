Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet jumps up two spots to reclaim the No. 1 spot on this week’s Billboard 200 Albums chart. This is the fourth nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard 200 for Short n’ Sweet, following its initial three week run at No. 1 after its release back in August. Elsewhere in the Billboard 200 Top 5, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft returns to the Top 5 for the first time in over a month after moving up three places to No. 5., aided by the launch of Eilish’s tour on Sept. 29 and the music video premiere for the album’s second single, “Birds of a Feather,” on September 27. Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess stays put at No. 2, Future’s Mixtape Pluto drops two spots to No. 3, and Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moves up a spot to No. 4.
