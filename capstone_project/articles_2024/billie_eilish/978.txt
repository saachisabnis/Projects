Having a mom as a celebrity means you get to do some cool things. For example, Christina Aguilera‘s daughter, Summer, got to meet Billie Eilish at one of Billie’s recent listening parties for her new album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT — and Christina couldn’t be more grateful.
On Wednesday, Christina posted footage of Billie meeting Summer at the event, asking her her name and autographing a poster for her. It’s not clear if Billie even knew who Summer’s mom is, but she was super nice to her, telling the 9-year-old, “Nice to meet you!” and posing for a photo with her.
The video also included footage of Summer filming Billie onstage during the event.
Christina gushed in the caption, “THANK YOU @billieeilish for making my daughter’s whole world at your LA listening party. I appreciate your kindness, thanks for signing her poster…we are both huge fans. Congrats on the new album!”  
Now let’s hope Xtina doesn’t have to explain the lyrics of “Lunch” to Summer.
Summer’s dad is Christina’s fiancé, Matt Rutler. She also has a 15-year-old son, Max, with her ex-husband Jordan Bratman.
