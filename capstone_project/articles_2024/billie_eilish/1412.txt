	In July, Cher was one of several Hollywood figures who commented on President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race. Writing that she was “tortured” by the news, Cher posted on X, “Because I Don’t believe the Democrats can win the Presidency with ‘Pres Biden’ ‘Joe’ whom I’ve loved since we met in 2008. I campaigned for him I believe it’s time to pass the baton, time for dems to think ‘way’ outside the box. Maybe even a split ticket.”
