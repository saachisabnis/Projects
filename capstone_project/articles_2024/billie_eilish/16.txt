YouTube asserted its dominance as a video platform that transcends traditional television at its upfront event at Lincoln Center in New York Wednesday, boasting billions of viewers and achieving highly relevant ads for its brand partners.
“We’re redefining what TV looks like, helping creators reach new heights and using AI (artificial intelligence) to expand creativity,” said Neal Mohan, CEO of YouTube. “YouTube views in the living room have grown 130% in the past three years.”
Citing Nielsen figures, Mohan added that YouTube has remained the leader in streaming watch time every month since February 2023. On average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on the big screen daily.
Unlike other media companies that simply pitch new TV shows, YouTube announced the launch and expansion of YouTube Select Creator Takeovers, allowing advertisers to buy inventory on channels representing the top 1% of content on the platform.
