Madonna and Akeem Morris further fueled romance speculation while taking a stroll around New York City on Saturday. 
The Queen of Pop, 66, was seen braving the bitter cold weather with an oversized jacket and scarf, while the 28-year-old soccer player wore a hooded sweatshirt and coat as they walked side by side. 
The “Vogue” singer and her rumored boyfriend’s latest sighting comes months after they first sparked romance talk.
Morris and the “Material Girl” singer were first romantically linked over the summer when the pop star posted images of them cuddling in July.
Then, in August, Madonna shared a photo of her seemingly not wearing a shirt as Morris sat behind her and smiled.
“Hot Fun in The Summer Time………🔥,” the singer captioned the steamy pic.
Morris also accompanied the mom of six to Italy for her 66th birthday celebration. There, they were seen holding hands while walking through Portofino.
More recently, Madonna and Morris attended a soccer game in London in September. 
At the time, the “Evita” actress shared a carousel of images from her trip to the UK, including photos of her with her alleged new man. 
“London Calling……………Back in the Stu with Stuart Price. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧! Go Chelsea ! ⚽️,” the “Next Best Thing” star captioned the post.
In one particular photo, Madonna and Morris smiled for a selfie while sitting in the stands of the Stamford Bridge stadium during a Chelsea F.C. soccer game.
And in another image, Madonna grabbed Morris’ arm as they walked out of the stadium together. 
They later attended a Billie Eilish concert together in October. 
He also previously met her kids at her twins’ 12th birthday party in August.
Prior to her romance with Morris, Madonna was linked to boxing coach Josh Popper.
