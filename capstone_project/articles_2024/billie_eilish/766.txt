More job-seekers are using ChatGPT to build their resume, and it's working. Executive Resume Writer & Career Coach Andrew Stoner explores the technology.
LOS ANGELES - Big record companies, including Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Records, have initiated lawsuits against AI music startups Suno and Udio for alleged copyright infringement. 
The claims suggest these companies are illegally using the recorded works of renowned artists ranging from Chuck Berry to Mariah Carey.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) revealed that one lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Boston targeting Suno AI. 
At the same time, another was lodged in New York against Uncharted Labs, which developed Udio AI. These legal actions underscore the ongoing conflict between traditional music entities and emerging AI technologies in the industry.

Suno AI’s CEO, Mikey Shulman, defended the technology in an emailed statement, asserting that their AI is designed to "generate completely new outputs" and not to "memorize and regurgitate pre-existing content." He expressed disappointment over the major labels' refusal to engage in constructive discussions. On the other hand, Udio has not yet responded to the allegations.
RIAA Chairperson and CEO Mitch Glazier criticized the AI startups for exploiting artists' works without proper licensing, suggesting that such actions hinder the progress of truly innovative AI applications in the music industry. 
This controversy highlights a broader debate within the music sector about balancing innovation and rights protection.
The controversy over AI in music isn’t new. In March, Tennessee became the first state to pass legislation protecting musicians from AI-driven exploitation.

This law was designed to prevent AI tools from replicating an artist’s voice without permission. Additionally, a collective of over 200 artists has voiced opposition to AI misuse in music through an open letter coordinated by the Artist Rights Alliance, urging tech companies to respect and not undermine artists' rights.
