Count Kim Gordon as a Billie Eillish fan.
Speaking with The Guardian, the Sonic Youth bassist/vocalist shares, “When it comes to pop icons, I would choose Billie Eilish.”
Gordon’s comments about the “bad guy” artist followed a less enthusiastic review of another pop star, Taylor Swift.
“I don’t know if it’s controversial but I’m not really a fan of Taylor Swift,” Gordon says. “I couldn’t tell you what her music sounded like, actually.”
Gordon debuted a new solo single, “ECRP,” in June. It follows her new album, The Collective, which dropped in March.
