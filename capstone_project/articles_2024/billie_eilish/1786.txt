Here at Post Wanted, we love dupes. 
From celebrity-loved earrings to cult-favorite hair tools, there’s always a great alternative to be found at a fraction of the price. And as professional shopping writers, we love a good perfume just as much as we love a fragrance dupe.
In 2023, Target launched fine’ry., a perfume line with spot-on dupes for expensive scents from luxury labels.

					The TikTok-viral brand is on sale for a limited time, and it’s ideal for your next beach trip.				

					Meet the fragrance more than 10K Amazon shoppers are grabbing: a lovely vanilla.				

					For a vanilla scent that’ll take you to the tropics, consider this on-sale spritz.				
Last year, Bath & Body Works is getting into the dupe game with the Everyday Luxuries collection inspired by luxury scents. There are currently 14 women’s fragrances in the collection, seven of which were released in January. Each retails at $18.95 for 8 oz. — which is an even better deal than Target’s dupes!
At the time of publishing, all of the fragrance mists and select additional products are part of a buy three, get three free or buy two, get one free deal. 
Below, you can check out the entire collection side-by-side with its luxury smell-a-likes.
