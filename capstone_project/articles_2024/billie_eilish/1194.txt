On Thursday (November 21), Billie Eilish was named Apple Music’s 2024 Artist of the Year, another hugely successful year for the nine-time Grammy winner. “Since day one, Apple Music has supported my music and artistry,” Eilish said in a statement. “And I am both honored and humbled to receive this recognition as Artist of the Year this many years into my career.” Eilish released her third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, in May, which hit No. 1 on Apple Music’s albums chart in 138 countries worldwide, while also reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The record and its singles are nominated for seven Grammys. “What’s been truly remarkable about watching her evolve over the course of this last year isn’t just that her voice and artistry have continued to resonate so widely,” says Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “It’s that she’s blossomed as bravely and honestly as she has — on her own terms, in her own way.” (Billboard)
