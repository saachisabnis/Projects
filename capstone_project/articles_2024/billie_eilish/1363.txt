 For the last month leftist journalists and celebrities have been in mourning after Donald Trump’s re-election as they cried that he won because of America’s “racism and sexism” and feared a re-invigorated Trump would be more “dangerous” than ever. 
The gnashing of teeth began right before (see here) the election and continued immediately afterwards (see here.)
Washington Post Editor, PBS contributor and MSNBCer Jonathan Capehart condemned the country for re-electing Trump: “The role of racism and sexism, misogyny, grievance, white nationalism....was very much a part of Donald Trump’s campaign.”
The elitist headline writers at The New Yorker ominously warned that Trump would return to the White House: “Far more dangerous than ever before.”
Hollywood weirdos were crestfallen. ABC late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel came close to tears as he condescendingly griped: “It was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him, and guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.” Actress Christina Applegate ran to X.com to post: “My child is sobbing because her rights as a woman may be taken away.”
The following are even more epic meltdowns and doomsaying from depressed journalists and saddened celebrities since Election Day: 
“The role of racism and sexism, misogyny, grievance, white nationalism, that was very much a part of Donald Trump’s campaign. And I think we need to acknowledge it. We need to talk about it. And then I think, as a country, we need to confront it. We’ve never done it in our history. We probably won’t do it now. But I think we need to acknowledge the fact that the incoming president of the United States openly ran on racist messages about fellow citizens, non-citizens, people who have always come to this country seeking a better life long before ‘Build the wall.’”— Washington Post Associate Editor/PBS contributor Jonathan Capehart on PBS’s News Hour, November 8.
“Donald Trump’s radical, ultranationalist agenda beginning to take shape this morning — mass deportations, tariffs, tax cuts for the wealthy and a new missile defense shield with the help of former NFL player Herschel Walker. We’ll have the details in a moment.”— Host Jim Acosta’s opening tease on CNN Newsroom, November 8. 
“Donald Trump’s Revenge — The former President will return to the White House older, less inhibited, and far more dangerous than ever before.”— Headline to November 6 The New Yorker article by Susan Glasser.
“On immigration, though, I think it’s worth remembering in his first term, [Trump] implemented and oversaw what has to be one of the darkest chapters in modern American history, and that was separating children from their parents forcibly for the purpose of separation, as a deterrence….Where you think a deterrence or a check would come into play, especially if Republicans control the senate as well? And as we’ve heard, he will probably fill a cabinet with loyalists and people who won’t say no to him.”— PBS anchor Amna Nawaz to PBS contributor/New York Times columnist David Brooks on PBS’s live election night coverage, November 6.
“There’s this sense, right, that whiteness, right, is under threat. The demographic shifts the country is in. ‘All these racially ambiguous children on Cheerios commercials are confusing the hell out of me.’...You’re telling me….that all of these people who believe….that bread is too high and eggs are too high, that they voted for a convicted felon….They voted for a crook — a person who they know is stealing from — just doing everything to undermine the so-called country that they love. And then they’re telling us the BS that it’s economics. We know that’s not true! We know it’s not true, and we got to raise our kids in this shit.”— MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude on MSNBC’s The 11th Hour, November 8. 
“Hey everyone, I’m just so disappointed that this Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, is being so rude, and I don’t know, just bigoted against Sarah McBride, who is a new congressperson from the state of Delaware. I know Sarah. She is the first openly transgender member of Congress, and she’s an extraordinary human being, has done a great job representing the people of Delaware and is now going to be doing it in Washington, and it just seems nasty and mean, and cruel because she is the only member who is now forbidden to use the ladies’ room and it’s just shitty, you know. Anyway, I just wanted to say that.”— Former NBC’s Today co-host and CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric from her TikTock account, November 20.
“Liberals or Democrats need to develop their own network, their own vast network of media entities.”— Former NBC’s Today show co-host and CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric on post-election edition of Next Question with Katie Couric podcast.
“There is an entire right wing media ecosystem that doesn’t exist on the left and it does not exist in the center or mainstream.”— PBS NewsHour White House correspondent/CNN analyst Laura Barron-Lopez on CNN’s Inside Politics, November 7.
“Talk about this loss of allyship in a very desperate time, that not only were white non-college educated women voting for Trump and against Harris, they were voting against the interest of their black and brown sisters in parts of the country where their lives are in danger….It’s a phenomenon that happens increasingly as women get married….How should people of color, women of color, women, how should we think about this moment and what lessons should be drawn from it, given how….demoralizing it is in the cause of equity and equality and just justice?”— Host Alex Wagner on MSNBC’s Alex Wagner Tonight, November 7.
“If historians in the future are allowed to write books — and, by the way, that question is open this morning. And if people are allowed to go on television and say what they think in the future — which, again, that question is open this morning, in the future, historians are going to look back on this day and say this is the day that America made a choice between freedom and democracy on one side and authoritarianism and dictatorship on the other.”— MSNBC contributor/presidential historian Michael Beschloss on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, November 5.
Host Seth Meyers: “Certainly Joe Biden stood up for unions….and I think it’s very fair to say that Donald Trump, and certainly Elon Musk, will not. And there was a time where that meant something. And I don't quite know why it doesn’t anymore.”Former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams: “To use a big word, there is a nihilism afoot, and it has been since the first Trump term….‘It’s not working for me, let’s burn the damn thing down.’ And that’s kind of a germ that’s going around the world, it’s not limited to us.”— NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers, November 20.
“What is wrong with America?...What is wrong with our country that the Republican Party would choose as a candidate and support a candidate who is an insurrectionist, who is an election denier, who is someone who is twice impeached, 34-time convicted felon, someone who has been accused of alleged sexual misconduct by 26 women, found liable for sexual abuse. What is wrong with this country that they would choose a message of divisiveness of xenophobia, of racism, of misogyny over a message of inclusiveness, a message for the people, by the people, of the people? That’s what the problem is, it’s the Republican Party!”— Host Sunny Hostin on ABC’s The View, November 8. 
“What’s happening — you might not learn from the news. Television news in the United States is a business, they have to make money….there’s a hole, there’s a vacuum. There is a gap — if you will — in information for Americans. Americans are very uninformed about reality. What’s really going on with climate change, Ukraine….you name it. All the biggest topics in the world. Americans have an appetite for a little bit of information. That vacuum is filled by the film industry.”    — Actor Alec Baldwin at Turin Film Festival press conference in Italy, November 26.
“You know, Italy has seen fascism. Italy has seen these things. You guys, you understand what happens. You have seen this before. My country is in its adolescence. Adolescence is very arrogant. Adolescence thinks it knows everything. Adolescence is naive and ignorant and arrogant, and we are in our ignorant, arrogant adolescence. We haven’t seen this before in our country. So, Americans who don’t travel, who 80 percent don’t have a passport, who are uneducated, are in their extraordinary naivete.”— Actress Sharon Stone at Turin Film Festival press conference in Italy, November 26.
“Some Democrats are loudly claiming the party needs to move to the center….A few things about that. First, if what you want is a centrist campaign that’s quiet on trans issues, tough on the border, distances itself from Palestinians, talks a lot about law and order, and reaches out to moderate Republicans, that candidate existed, and she just lost.”— Host John Oliver on HBO’s Last Week Tonight, November 10. 
 “Please take a moment on this special holiday weekend to let your elected representatives know you do not want your tax dollars going to a right-wing government that is hell-bent on civilian mass starvation and death….What better way to celebrate losing the November 5th election than by continuing to ignore the will of the American people who oppose Israel’s war on Gaza. Nothing says to the public ‘we hear you’ better than the Democratic Party announcing that ‘we’re going to kill even more children in Palestine now with your/our American tax dollars….What better way to celebrate the current holiday season — including the one where we feast and remember how the Indigenous people of the Americas saved our lives by feeding us a meal right in the middle of our European ancestors committing the largest mass genocide in human history....A Theocracy Is Never a Democracy. Not in Iran. Not in an America run by the Moral Majority or Christian Nationalists. Not in an Israel that has sadly lost its way.”— Film director Michael Moore in a Substack post, November 30. 
 “If we don’t show up tomorrow, it is entirely possible that we will not have the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again.”— Oprah Winfrey at Kamala Harris rally, November 4.
“My child is sobbing because her rights as a woman may be taken away. Why? And if you disagree, please unfollow me.”— Deleted post-election X.com post by actress Christina Applegate.
“It’s a war on women.”— Deleted post-election Instagram post by singer Billie Eilish. 
 “So the results are in. Many will be celebrating, possibly even gloating over their victory. Many will be stunned and sad with the terrible feelings of the loss….It means a sure return to a more restrictive, some fear draconian time. Many fear their rights will be impeded and denied. Many, minority groups and young people will be afraid. Gay and trans people will be more afraid. We know that many women will now find it difficult to get the reproductive healthcare that they need and deserve. For all those people there will be those who will help you. Me included. But what it really means is that we wake up and fight. Fight for women and our children and their futures and fight against tyranny, one day at a time. One fight at a time. One protest at a time.”— November 6 Instagram post by actress Jamie Lee Curtis. 
“Great job giving the MAGA gang more power, America. Wonder how many folks are seeing this and STILL saying ‘But but but at least he’s not a Black woman!’ in the privacy of their homes tonight. My heart is broken 💔”— November 6 X.com post by actress Sophia Bush.
“There’s a sign you can see in many shops that sell beautiful but fragile items: LOVELY TO LOOK AT, DELIGHTFUL TO HOLD, BUT ONCE YOU BREAK IT, THEN IT’S SOLD. You can say the same about democracy.”— Deleted post-election X.com post by author Stephen King.
“Elections have consequences. The Supreme Court will be changed for a generation. I’ll never see a moderate court again in my lifetime. Alito and Thomas will step down and Trump will appoint 40 year old partisans to the bench. The damage he is about to inflict on our institutions the next 2 years will be irreparable.”— November 6 X.com post by HBO’s The Wire actor Wendell Pierce. 
 “I find myself speechless in the midst of this. Another four years of hatred, leaning us towards a world I do not want to live in. Leaning us towards a world that will be hard to raise my daughter in. Leaning us towards a world that will force her to have a baby she doesn’t want. Leaning us towards a world that is fearful….I shouldn’t be this shocked. But I am. I am heartbroken for my friends who awoke fear this morning. And I am here with you. To cry, to yell, to hug…..May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.”
…
“There is also a deep, deep sickness in this country that is shown in the sheer amount of people who showed up for this man who threatens our democracy. It is terrifying the number of people who stand behind what this man preaches. It is foolish subscription to a false sense of security, of masculinity, of intelligence, of patriotism, and of humanity. There is no help, no counsel, in any of them.”— From multiple post-election Instagram Stories posts by Disney’s Snow White (2025) actress Rachel Zegler. Zegler later apologized.  
“Donald Trump himself said that he wants to make biological sex the law of the land, and that is assigned at birth, and that is binary. This is what Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, has basically also asserted. This has never been about the children, it’s been about scapegoating trans people, eradicating us from public life….The most important thing for us to remember as trans people and then as people in general is that when we dehumanize people, we dehumanize ourselves….If a group of people is rendered subhuman, the Nazis use the term untermenschen, subhuman, then we can take away their rights, then we can abuse them and commit violence against them.”— Actor/activist Laverne Cox on CNN News Central, November 20.
“Well, [bleep]. It happened….Today, I wore my ‘I am questioning my fundamental belief in the goodness of humanity’ sticker....the majority has spoken, and they said that they don’t care that much about democracy.”— Host Stephen Colbert on CBS’s The Late Show, November 6.
“We had the choice between a prosecutor and a criminal, and we chose the criminal to be president of the United States. More than half of this country voted for the criminal who is planning to pardon himself for his crimes….It was a terrible night last night. It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hard-working immigrants who make this country go, for healthcare, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech. It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on Social Security, for our allies in Ukraine, for NATO, for the truth and democracy and decency and it was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him, and guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.”— Host Jimmy Kimmel on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, November 6.
