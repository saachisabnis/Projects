The rumor mill is swirling on social media with reports that Jack Antonoff may have taken a subtle dig at singer Billie Eilish.
During an interview on the Today show, which was posted to the show's Youtube Channel on Thursday, July 4, the Taylor Swift producer discussed his band Bleacher's new self-titled album and his songwriting process.
Antonoff, 40, remarked that his inspiration often comes from emotionally impactful experiences rather than mundane events, using the example of a great sandwich. "It's hard to write unless you're really compelled, and sometimes what compels you is way more serious things. I never feel like... You don't hear a lot of great songs about like, one's lunch order. So the things you don't really understand and cause you pain are usually things worth writing about," he said.
While the comment might appear innocuous, it has been interpreted by some as a slight towards 22-year-old Eilish. Her latest album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, features a lead single titled "Lunch." Despite the song not actually being about food but rather her attraction to women, Antonoff's remark has sparked debate online.
In a post shared to X (formerly known as Twitter) about the alleged shade by Pop Crave, fans were quick to share their opinions in the replies. "Jack Antonoff has become increasingly more annoying as time goes on. He acts holier than thou. Imo," said one user, dissing the musician. Other's supported Antoff, saying things like, "I'm crying he doesn't even know anything about the song 😭," and "he didn't diss Billie , her dumb fans only attacking him cause he's associated with Taylor."
In a March interview with Billboard, Eilish expressed frustration over what she sees as wasteful practices in the music industry, with some thinking the "All I Ever Wanted" singer taking a dig at Swift. "We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it's very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging," she said before continuing, "I can't even express to you how wasteful it is. It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right." The singer later claimed the remarks were not about a specific artist but rather the industry as a whole.
This remark also comes after Swift blocked Eilish from the #1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart for the second week in a row.
