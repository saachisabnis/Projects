Fans Provided Convenient Transportation Options to Kia Forum Venue
With excitement building for Billie Eilish’s much-anticipated Hit Me Hard and Soft listening party at the Kia Forum next week, fans are eager to secure their spots for the event. To alleviate transportation concerns, Metro has announced three convenient ways for attendees to travel to and from the venue.
On May 16, 2024, Metro will observe a Free Fare Day, granting attendees complimentary rides on the entire Metro system, including bus shuttles to and from the Kia Forum from the C and K Lines. This initiative aims to facilitate easy access for fans residing across various parts of Los Angeles, including the Westside, Eastside, Central LA and points north.
For attendees traveling from the Westside, Eastside, Central LA, and points north, the E Line to Expo/Crenshaw Station presents the most direct route. From there, a simple transfer to the K Line, just across the street, will transport fans directly to the venue. Alternatively, for those journeying from the south and east, options include taking the C Line from Norwalk Station if coming from Orange County, or from Redondo Beach, Douglas, El Segundo, or Mariposa stations if traveling from the South Bay and El Segundo area.
Metro also offers bus options for attendees, with Line 115 on Firestone Bl/Manchester Av and Line 212 on La Brea Av providing convenient drop-off points near the venue.
However, Metro advises attendees to plan their journeys carefully, particularly if traveling from more distant stations, as transit times may exceed two hours.
For those unfamiliar with the Metro system or the Los Angeles region, assistance is readily available through the Transit Info line at 323.466.3876. Additionally, the Metro trip planner can help attendees map out their routes in advance.
Furthermore, for attendees who prefer to drive part of the way, parking facilities are available at many Metro stations, offering a convenient parking option for those commuting to the event.
Metro aims to ensure that transportation logistics do not dampen the enthusiasm of fans eager to experience this highly-anticipated event.For more information and assistance, visit the Metro website at https://www.metro.net/riding/trip-planner/ or contact Metro Transit Info at 323.466.3876.
