Eminem fans got an accidental peek at what his upcoming album The Death Of Slim Shady may look like, which would include features by J. Cole, JID and more.
On Saturday (July 6), @SyrianAlmond on X (formerly Twitter) shared a series of screenshots captured from the Apple Music app. Upon making the album available as a pre-save item, the platform accidentally made the 20-track playlist public.

Among the listed tracks included a posse cut titled “Cypher Intermission,” which features Cole alongside Black Thought, Tech Nine, Ez Mil and Royce Da 5’9″ — who also appears later on the project as the sole feature on the song “Threequel.”
The purported Death Of Slim Shady track listing also revealed a feature from Billie Eilish; a track with contributions by both JID and Skylar Grey; and appearances by Dr. Dre and 50 Cent on the song “Onslaught.”

In a late post, the Twitter user wrote: “DISCLAIMER! This could very well be fake. I don’t claim that this is any sort of confirmation. I just seen it and posted. [shrug emoji] Take it with a grain of salt.”
Commenters also noted that fake Eminem tracklists have made their way online before. The Apple Music page for the album now shows each track by only its number, with the exception of the singles “Houdini” and “Tobey.”

Eminem recently released the latter with Big Sean and Babytron, and he has now offered an explanation for why its music video did not go live in time.
A visual supplement for “Tobey” directed by Cole Bennett was supposed to drop on Friday (July 5). When it failed to manifest as promised, the 51-year-old rapper took to social media that same day and instead shared a snippet that alludes to the imagery of The Marshall Mathers LP from 2000.

“Tobey” originally hit streaming platforms on Tuesday (July 2). Joining the never-ending debate over the greatest rappers of all time, he asserts his dominance in the culture while addressing those who have questioned it.
“Ain’t feelin’ your top five favorite rappers/ So I know they ’bout to be pissed at me/ But this, to me, is a mystery/ How rappers I’ve already ripped could be/ Higher up on a list than me/ Yet here I sit on your list though at five (Hm), which still was fine/ But just know inside, to me, that shit’s hilarious,” he spits on the explosive track.

Shifting his focus to Melle Mel’s recent criticism of his place in Hip Hop, he adds: “When I get dissed though and by a pioneer/ Who was one of the reasons why I am here/ They tell me I should just let that shit go and slide/ ‘Melle Mel shouldn’t get no reply’/ ‘That man is a legend,’ bitch, so am I.”
Em’s twelfth studio album The Death of Slim Shady (Coupe De Grâce) is scheduled to be released on July 12.
