Now the first Monday in May has arrived, some of the most prolific A-listers in the world will be getting ready to walk the red carpet at the annual Met Ball.
The star-studded event was originally conceived as a fundraising gala, aiming to benefit the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York’s Costume Institute.
However, most of us probably most associate it as the red carpet event where the likes of Rihanna, Zendaya, Kim Kardashian and Cardi B can all be seen serving up some jaw-dropping fashion moments, with each year’s event being given a particular theme (which the celebs on the guestlist each interpret in their own way).
But it’s not just the red carpet fashion that gets us talking at the Met Gala every year.
Across the decades, the event has generated countless headlines thanks to bust-ups, A-list incidents and attention-grabbing stunts.
To get us in the mood for this year’s event, here are XX moments that defined the Met Ball…
