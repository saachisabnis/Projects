Eiza González is a fan of Billie Eilish. The Mexican actress attended Eilish's concert in Los Angeles over the weekend, wearing a comfortable and fashionable outfit led by a gorgeous brown coat. 
Paparazzi spotted González leaving the theater, wearing an outfit made up of a brown coat with a furry cream-colored lining. She completed the look with a white t-shirt, jeans, a white cap, and some white sneakers with black details. 
She also wore a black clutch purse and held onto her iPhone. 
González and Billie Eilish first met at the 2022 Met Gala, where the two were photographed laughing together as they walked inside the museum. While it's unknown if the two remain in touch, the photographs were an exciting moment for their fans, showing the two sharing their admiration for the other. 
González enjoys fashion, developing a distinct look over her years in Hollywood. Over the past couple of months, she has been photographed walking in New York, showing off her street style.
In November, when the weather hadn't gotten as cold as it is now, González wore a gorgeous long and grey coat that makes for a perfect companion for many cold and cozy days. 
She paired the look with a cap, some black cowboy boots, jeans, and a cream-colored top, resulting in a stylish look that was elegant, comfortable, and a perfect representation of the types of clothes that she likes to wear.
González travels the world due to her work, but she spends a large percentage of her time in New York. As is the case with the city and its transitional weather, she values comfortable clothes that can adapt to anything and that are comfortable for walking to and from various locations.
