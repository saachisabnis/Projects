Billie Eilish is happier than ever after she accomplished her 2024 goal of having “good sex.”
When the singer, 23, was asked to respond with a thumbs up or thumbs down to the goal she set during last year’s “Billie Eilish: Same Interview” with Vanity Fair, Eilish chuckled and said she certainly “got there!”
“I’ve had a lot of good sex, so … you’re welcome, Billie!” the Grammy winner said during her eighth annual video interview for the publication released on Wednesday.
Of course, having sex wasn’t the only thing the “Bad Guy” hitmaker wanted to do in 2024. 
During this year’s interview, which was filmed on Oct. 18, Eilish said she wanted to go skydiving, accomplish stunt driving, get “more” piercings and tattoos and spend more time with loved ones. 
“I’ve done nothing but make friends all year and gotten so close with people that I wasn’t with before and became friends with people I used to be friends with again,” she recalled, looking back at 2024.
“It’s just been a year filled with friendship which, honestly, even though I was saying a lot of things that I want to do, that was the real … that was the thing that I wanted to do.”
Eilish’s sex reveal comes two months after the singer said she wanted to keep her dating life private going forward. 
“I wish no one knew anything about my sexuality or anything about my dating life ever, ever, ever,” she told Vogue two months ago.
“And I hope that they never will again.”
The “Birds of a Feather” musician set the boundary on her love life after she openly admitted she’s “physically attracted” to women and it was misinterpreted as her coming out publicly. 
Although the Oscar winner hasn’t gone public with anyone in recent months, she was previously linked to Neighbourhood singer Jesse Rutherford.
The pair dated from October 2022 until they called it quits in May 2023.
