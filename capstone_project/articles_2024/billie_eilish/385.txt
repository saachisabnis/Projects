Cillian Murphy was fresh off his Golden Globes success as he stepped out at the 14th Governors Awards in Los Angeles on Tuesday with his Oppenheimer co-stars.
The Irish actor, 47, scooped up Best Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama at the Globes on Monday for his much-praised performance in Christopher Nolan's latest drama.
Fresh off his big win, Cillian was joined by co-stars Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt at The Ray Dolby Ballroom for yet another awards ceremony.
He cut a dapper figure in a black satin shirt and smart trousers, which he styled with a pinstripe suit jacket and patent shoes.
Cillian - who portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in the film - added a pop of colour to his ensemble with a red pocket square as he posed with his Oppenheimer co-stars.

Florence, who starred as Jean Tatlock in Oppenheimer, put on a very glitzy display in a sparkling pink sequinned gown with halter-neck straps.
She gave herself a few extra inches in a pair of silver strapped heels and styled her platinum bob in a curled style for the glitzy A-list event.
She was joined by Emily, 40, who made sure to capture attention in a black gown with a plunging neckline with an extravagant silver neckpiece.
Emily, who starred as Katherine 'Kitty' Oppenheimer in the film, further accessorised her glamorous look with droplet silver earrings and a bangle.
Robert - who won Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture at the Golden Globes for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the epic - cut a suave figure in a grey tuxedo for the glitzy affair.
The Governors Awards is an annual event celebrating awards conferred by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's Board of Governors. 
This year, the Academy honored Angela Bassett, Mel Brooks, Carol Littleton and Michelle Satter.
Cillian's attendance at the ceremony came just days after he took home Best Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama for his performance in Oppenheimer at the Golden Globes.

Cillian received a kiss from his proud wife Yvonne as it was revealed he'd won the Best Actor award, and paid tribute to her and their kids Aran, 16, and Malachy, 17, in his acceptance speech. 
'To my family, I'm the luckiest man and I love you,' he said. 'Two-thirds of them are sitting down there. We had to leave one of them at home doing exams.
'But just thanks for putting up with me — putting up with the half me and the shadow me and the absent me, the remains of me when I'm doing a film like this or work in general. You're always there. I love it. So thanks, guys.'
After gracing the red carpet solo, Cillian was joined at the ceremony by his wife Yvonne, who he married in 2004, and their younger son Aran. The couple are also parents to Malachy.
Cillian — who plays the theoretical physicist who helped develop the Atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan's war drama — beat the likes of Maestro's Bradley Cooper and Killers Of The Flower Moon's Leonardo DiCaprio to the Best Actor gong. 
The film also took home Best Director - Motion Picture for Christopher Nolan, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score - Motion Picture, and Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture for Robert Downey Jr.
Cillian has previously detailed the extreme lengths he went to in a bid to portray the physicist on screen, losing weight to mirror his 'almost emaciated' frame.
Robert was seen striking an array of playful poses as he had the time of his life with Cillian at the ceremony

Emily Blunt revealed that her co-star only survived off an 'almond a day' in his grueling diet.
She told Extra: 'He had such a monumental undertaking. And he could only eat, like, an almond every day. He was so emaciated.'
Cillian has warned that his transformation wasn't 'healthy' and has advised people not to try it for themselves.
He took more than five months before filming to prepare himself both physically and emotionally for the role.
