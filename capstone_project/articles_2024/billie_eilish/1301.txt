Lets normalise affordable pricing pls
With dynamic pricing, ticket touts, vip packages and more expensive tickets in general, gigs are becoming increasingly inaccessible for not only students, but those in employment too. All of our fave artists from Taylor Swift, Oasis, Sabrina Carpenter and Childish Gambino seem to be touring- but with the rising costs of concert tickets, do we even have the funds to go and see them on tour?
Here’s a ranking of the most expensive gig tickets in 2024.
A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)
Sabrina Carpenter’s Short and Sweet Tour will commence in the UK in March 2025. Ticket prices range from £58.45 – £115.20.
But if you want to treat yourself and get a VIP package, the most expensive ticket on the Team Sabrina Preshow Party Package retails at £331.65 and includes a ticket to the show, early entry, a preshow party and merch pack.

For fans wanting to see Olivia in her Guts Tour, standing tickets cost £92.95, while aisle seats ranged in price from £75.95 to £143.50. Despite the high prices, Olivia Rodrigo did release a small amount silver star tickets, which are essentially tickets that had not been sold and which could be for anywhere in the venue but cost just £2o.
Tickets for The New World Tour will set you back £93 to £196, according to AXS.

Prices for Dua Lipa’s two Wembley dates for her Radical Optimism Tour range from £64 to £85 for level five seats, £130 to £155 for lower level seats. Rear pitch standing will cost you £98 and Gold Circle standing is said to be priced at £130.
However, prices on Ticketmaster for a rear standing ticket for at Wembley are priced at £181.80, whilst Gold Circle standing tickets are priced at £208.15 each meaning perhaps dynamic pricing is at play.

Tickets for Ice Spice general standing for the Y2K! World Tour are priced at £58.35, If you want to buy an early entry VIP package, that’ll set you back £140.10 and if you want to actually meet Ice Spice and get a pic, along with early entry and a merch item and VIP lanyard, the Y2K! meet and greet experience costs you £216.35 according to LiveNation.

Tickets for Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour at the O2 Arena next summer are costing between £92.51 and £386, with most standing tickets costing £145. 
A post shared by BST Hyde Park (@bsthydepark)
This year Stevie Nicks headlined London’s BST Hyde Park 2024, which was her first UK date in seven years. Ticket prices started at £90.45 for general admission and go all the way up to £450 for VIP.
However, tickets also included performances from Brandi Carli, Paris Paloma and Baby Queen. Stevie also brought out Harry Styles for a surprise duet, which makes the price pretty worth it to be honest.
A post shared by Oasis (@oasis)
The long awaited return of the Gallagher brothers has led to uproar about the cost of ticket prices for many. In Wembley Stadium the cheapest tickets cost £74.25, with the most expensive ticket a £506.25 pre-show party, exhibition and seated package. 
However with dynamic pricing in place, which is when ticket retailers like Ticketmaster increase the prices of tickets when demand is high, has caused lots of backlash from fans who were expecting to pay around £148, but were only offered tickets worth £300 and up after reaching the front of the virtual queue. Many people were unable to purchase tickets or were left massively out of pocket, resulting in the government launching an investigation into the ordeal.
However despite the high prices, Oasis Live ’25 sold out and so the brothers have added two two extra Wembley shows.
A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)
If you weren’t able to go yourself, you definitely saw it on your Instagram timeline. The Eras Tour is now the highest grossing tour ever, so it’s not surprising that tickets are pricey.
However, Eras tour VIP packages started from £195, with the most expensive package costing a whopping £662.40.
A post shared by Adele (@adele)
Although not in the UK, Adele performed at 10 summer shows in Munich this year, with the performances being her first shows in mainland Europe since 2016 when she toured her third album. The cheapest tickets available were were €75 (£63) and the most expensive tickets available was a seated VIP package with early entry, which came at a huge cost of £984, making these the most expensive gig tickets in 2024. There were also a limited number of lucky dip tickets sold for €35 (£30) per ticket via Ticketmaster. However, it seems like the average price paid by fans to be apart at the purpose-built 80,000 capacity Messe München arena was around £250 to 400 euros.
