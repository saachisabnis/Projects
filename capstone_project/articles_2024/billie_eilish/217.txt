"Wouldn't that be interesting to go, especially with it being here in L.A., and win a gold medal?"
Dr. Dre has shared that he is “deadass serious” about competing in archery for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Speaking to Entertainment Tonight in an interview, the iconic producer and musician opened up about the prestigious sporting event and how it’s being held in his native hometown in 2028 and shared that he is interested in competing in the games.
“I’m starting to try out for the Olympics in 2028,” Dre said. He then went on to reveal that would be trying out for archery. “I’m deadass serious….I started playing around with archery in junior high. I stopped for a while, and my son bought me a setup; I don’t know if it was for my birthday or Father’s Day or something like that, so I have it set up in my backyard.

He continued, “I’ve heard that qualifying for the Olympics is 77 feet. I practice at 90. Wouldn’t that be interesting to go, especially with it being here in L.A., and win a gold medal? I feel like I can do anything.”
Back in 2022, Dre took some time to teach American radio host and actor Big Boy how to use a bow and arrow. Footage of their practice session showed the ‘Forgot About Dre’ producer and big boy in a field shooting the apparatus at the intended target.
In other news, Dre recently performed at the 2024 Paris Olympics closing ceremony in Los Angeles alongside Billie Eilish, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Snoop Dogg.
