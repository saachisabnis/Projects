Brigitte Macron was the epitome of French elegance this week. 
She has been captivating onlookers at the Paris 2024 Paralympics Opening Ceremony with her impeccable style, in not just one but two custom Louis Vuitton creations.
 Arriving at the Élysée Palace reception prior to the event, she exuded sophistication in a white double Mikado wool silk ensemble. The collarless jacket, featuring short sleeves and a rounded edge, perfectly complemented the matching knee-length dress, creating a look that was both refined and contemporary. 
For the Opening Ceremony at Place de la Concorde on August 28, Brigitte Macron continued to stun in a custom vanilla technical gabardine jacket, tailored to perfection with martingale details accentuating her waist. 
Paired with matching cigarette trousers, the outfit was a masterclass in modern tailoring. To complete her ensemble, she carried a Slim Trunk bag from the French fashion house, adding a touch of structured elegance that tied the look together.
