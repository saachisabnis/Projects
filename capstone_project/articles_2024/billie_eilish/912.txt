After the rise and success of Disney animated movies, there was a new evolution in the scene thanks to the digital animation company Pixar. With films like The Incredibles, Up, and more, Pixar has followed in the footsteps of Disney to create some of the most beloved films in recent history. And part of that footstep following comes in the form of music. 
Here below, we wanted to explore three songs from popular Pixar films that captured audiences. A trio of tunes that compel any viewer to start signing along. Three songs that accentuate and improve the movie they are in. Indeed, these are three classic Pixar songs that continue to teach the art of joy in animated movies.

Written by Randy Newman and produced by Don Was, this is probably the most famous song from Pixar movies as it’s from the most famous offering from the company, the groundbreaking 1995 effort Toy Story. The song, sung by Newman in his playful voice, is all about friendship and love between two people—or, between a child and his favorite toy. It’s about loyalty and having each other’s backs. In this world of trials and tribulations, a song of friendship like this can quickly bring a tear to your eye. But it’s presented in such a joyful way. Sings Newman on the Oscar-nominated number, 
You’ve got a friend in meYou’ve got a friend in meWhen the road looks rough aheadAnd you’re miles and milesFrom your nice warm bedYou just remember what your old pal saidBoy, you’ve got a friend in meYeah, you’ve got a friend in me
Not necessarily the most lively song in the world, this track from the 2017 film Coco is stunning nonetheless. It’s simple and elegant, featuring a Spanish acoustic guitar and a message of remembrance. Coco is a movie that deals with death and the afterlife and so the idea of remembering a family member who has passed away is a central theme. Not an easy task when it comes to a kids movie and yet thanks to songs like this, Coco pulls it off with aplomb. Written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and sung by Benjamin Bratt, this Oscar-winning song begins, 
Remember meThough I have to say goodbyeRemember meDon’t let it make you cryFor even if I’m far awayI hold you in my heartI sing a secret song to youEach night we are apart
Written by pop star siblings Finneas O’Connell and Billie Eilish, this track brings to life the boy band era of the late 1990s and early 2000s. It also features the magnetic line: But they don’t turn my tummy the way you do. Want to get a great pop song in an animated video? Well, hire some of the best pop songwriters in the business. And that’s just what Pixar did for this film about a group of young girls growing up together. And for those who grew up in the boy band era, it’s an especially fun offering. Performed by Josh Levi, Grayson Villanueva, and Topher Ngo, the track opens, 
I’ve never met nobody like youHad friends, and I’ve had buddies, it’s trueBut they don’t turn my tummy the way you doI’ve never met nobody like youOh, yeahYeah
You’re never not on my mind, oh my, oh myI’m never not by your side, your side, your sideI’m never gon’ let you cry, oh, cry, don’t cryI’ll never not be your ride or die, alright
