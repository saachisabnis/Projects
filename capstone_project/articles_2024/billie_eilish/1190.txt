Glastonbury Festival fans have officially been waiting for the longest time in more than 17 years to find out which acts will be playing at this year’s festival. Music lovers have been patiently waiting for the first wave of headliners and artists to be announced since the ticket sales were delayed by two weeks in November.
Fan account The Glasto Thingy shared a list of the last 20 years’ worth of festivals and when the first headliner was announced. The dates listed mean that the public has officially been waiting the longest amount of time since 2006, when The Killers were announced, to know who will be taking to the stage at Worthy Farm.
 Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, the account wrote: “This means that, unless something comes out today, it is now the longest we have gone without any acts being announced since 2007. That year, the first announcement was made on February 17th. #Glastonbury.” 
The longest wait for act announcements occurred in 2002, when the full line-up was revealed on June 19. That year the festival took place between June 28 and 30.
Some of the earliest artists to be announced to the festival include Billie Eilish (October 4, 2021 for 2022), Diana Ross (October 10, 2020 for 2022), Radiohead (October 20, 2016 for 2017), and REM (October 24, 2002 for 2003).
A number of Glastonbury fans have been left on the edge of their seats waiting to find out who will be gracing the Pyramid Stage. Skillfulperson wrote: “Pearl jam and acdc making announcements this week.”
Dicko said: “Surely they're waiting for the AC/DC announcement tomorrow.”
Glastonbury Festival changed the ticket sale date at the last minute in November last week. This was to “ensure that everyone who would like to buy a ticket is registered”. 
The sales took place on Thursday, November 16 and Sunday, November 19, respectively. This year's festival will be taking place between Wednesday, June 26 and Sunday, June 30.
