Billie Eilish has signed on to read a bedtime story to preschool-age viewers on Friday, July 19. The music superstar will take part in the program known as CBeebies, which is a UK preschool TV channel as well as a Broadcast Digital Award-winning social media outlet. Eilish will read the beloved children’s book, This Moose Belongs to Me, by acclaimed author and illustrator Oliver Jeffers, which will be broadcast on CBeebies and BBC iPlayer. “My favorite thing in the world as a child was a bedtime story and I would be upset if I didn’t get one! I had a lot and I loved them all!” Eilish said in a statement Monday. In reference to the titular moose named Marcel from the book she’ll be reading, Eilish said, “We need to look after beautiful, wild creatures like Marcel, but we also need to let them do their own thing.” (UPI)
