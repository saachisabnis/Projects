Billie Eilish is opening up about the extreme thing she had to do in order to shoot her "Hit Me Hard and Soft" album cover!
According to People, Billie revealed she had to be underwater with weights on her while on The Late Show!
"I had gone to sleep at 7 a.m... I woke up, I dyed my hair black — it was like bright red — I dyed it black that day. Then I went to this random place in Santa Clarita or some nonsense."
People reports Billie went on to say, "There's a tank in this giant place, and it was, like, 10-feet deep. And I popped my little ass in there, and I was in there for six hours... I was wearing big long pants, giant shorts, a thermal long-sleeve, a button-up flannel, a tie, rings, arm warmers, bracelet and a weight — I had a weight strapped to me."
