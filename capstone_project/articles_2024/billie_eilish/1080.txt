UPROXX Sessions is back with a fresh selection of performances from the hottest rising stars in music. Last fall, we left off on a performance of Monaleo’s “Crying On Your Birthday,” so it’s only fitting that we return with another birthday-themed song. 
This one is called “Birthday Dance” and comes courtesy of another Texas native, R&B singer-songwriter Josh Levi. If his voice sounds familiar, that’s because you’ve had a few chances to hear it before. He was a finalist on the third season of The X Factor, and in 2022 he voiced one of the members of the fictional boy band 4*Town in the Pixar animated film Turning Red, where he placed his first Billboard Hot 100 charting song “Nobody Like U,” which was co-written by Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell.
“Birthday Dance,” which appears on Levi’s 2023 project Disc Two (Scratched Up), is a laid-back groove encouraging its addressee to bust a move on the dance floor in celebration of their special day. “Sittin’ here on your birthday,” he croons. “But it seems like the worst day / Let me make you feel okay / Can I take you home tonight?”
