Tyler, the Creator’s new album, CHROMAKOPIA, debuts atop the Billboard 200 chart this week, giving the Grammy-winning rapper his third No. 1 album of his career. Even though CHROMAKOPIA dropped on a Monday and not the standard Friday release, it still moved 299,500 units, marking Tyler’s most successful week ever while becoming the sixth largest debut of 2024. Two other debuts cracked the Top 5, as Halsey’s The Great Impersonator premieres at No. 2, and Kelsea Ballerini’s Patterns opens at No. 4, her highest charting album of her career. Eminem was a big mover, as The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) jumps from No. 44 to No. 6 following its vinyl release. Elsewhere in the Top 10, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet drops a spot to No. 3, Rod Wave’s Last Lap slides down a slot to No. 5, Gracie Abrams’ The Secret of Us moves up one to No. 7, Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time falls two spots to No. 8, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft stays at No. 9, and GloRilla’s Glorious falls three slots to No. 10.
