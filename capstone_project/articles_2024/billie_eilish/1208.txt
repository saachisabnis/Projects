Lunar Vacation, a 5-piece pop-rock band from Atlanta are back with their sophomore album, “Everything Matters, Everything’s Fire”. This album comes from a place of cohesion, as the band’s members all live together as well as create music together. With so many voices on the project it can be easy to have something come out discombobulated; however, the group used the abundance of ideas to their advantage to create a dynamic set of songs.


Drawing inspiration from many sounds like shoegaze and synth, and using different tempos to create peaks and valleys, this album is guaranteed to draw in listeners of all kinds of music.


This week’s highlighted track, “Set the Stage”, leans heavily into the shoegaze realm of indie pop with sweet vocals delivering emotional lyrics.

Rife with textures of 70s funk and Japanese city pop of the 80s, this album is a danceable and groovy sonic experience.


This week’s highlighted track, “Lilliputian Chop” is an optimistic and fast-paced disco number accompanied by a fluidly dipping saxophone.


6) Jamie XX – “In Waves” (2024)


Since 2006, James Thomas Smith has been a part of the musical world. Beginning with the band The xx, Smith honed his talent for sampling and remixing before going out under the name Jamie xx to release solo work. He received acclaim for remixes of a Gil Scott-Heron album, “I’m New Here”, entitled “We’re New Here”. Most notably his remix of the song “I’ll Take Care of You” was used as the base of Drake and Rihanna’s 2011 hit “Take Care”.


In this new album, Jamie xx uses the staple sounds of house music with some R&B samples to create an irresistibly danceable set of songs. The use of horn also adds a lot of flare to the album on tracks like “Baddy On The Floor” and “Life”. “In Waves” also features many of the artist’s longtime collaborators like The Avalanches, and Romy who was also a member of The xx.

4) Crumb – “AMAMA” (2024)

The title of the album, “AMAMA”, is the word for ‘grandmother’ in many Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, which is reflective of Ramani’s Indian heritage. The title makes more sense when you dive into the title track which opens with a sample of Ramani’s grandmother singing in Malayalam.

This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.

Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.
The highlighted track, “Tunnel Vision” builds into an intense blend of synths and electric guitars with distorted vocals to emphasize the intense feeling of the song as it builds.

Beginning with the band The xx, Smith honed his talent for sampling and remixing before going out under the name Jamie xx to release solo work. He received acclaim for remixes of a Gil Scott-Heron album, “I’m New Here”, entitled “We’re New Here”. Most notably his remix of the song “I’ll Take Care of You” was used as the base of Drake and Rihanna’s 2011 hit “Take Care”.


In this new album, Jamie xx uses the staple sounds of house music with some R&B samples to create an irresistibly danceable set of songs. The use of horn also adds a lot of flare to the album on tracks like “Baddy On The Floor” and “Life”. “In Waves” also features many of the artist’s longtime collaborators like The Avalanches, and Romy who was also a member of The xx.


The highlighted track this week, “Baddy On The Floor” features Honey Dijon and is the perfect blend of jazz and house.


5) Fontaines D.C. – “Romance” (2024)


This Dublin-based post-punk band formed in college over a shared love of all things poetic. In 2018 the group began self-releasing their songs and performing live, to the point of gaining the attention of Partisan Records. Since then the band’s albums have been met with critical acclaim and even a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album in 2021 with “A Hero’s Death”.
The release of “Romance” came in late August of this year to chart in several countries including the UK, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the USA.
Our highlighted track, “Favourite”, has a free feeling reminiscent of The Cure with a catchy guitar melody and breezy vocals.


4) Crumb – “AMAMA” (2024)


Back with their third album, Brooklyn-based psychedelic-rock band Crumb brings a lighthearted vibe to “AMAMA”. The band consists of Lila Ramani, Bri Aronow, Jesse Brotter, and Jonathan Gilad. With poetic lyrics written by Ramani, and hypnotic instrumental, this album is full of bright spots.
The title of the album, “AMAMA”, is the word for ‘grandmother’ in many Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, which is reflective of Ramani’s Indian heritage. The title makes more sense when you dive into the title track which opens with a sample of Ramani’s grandmother singing in Malayalam.
This week we’re highlighting the track “The Bug” , a psychedelic rock tune with colorful guitar work.


3) beabadoobee – “This Is How Tomorrow Moves” (2024)


British singer/songwriter beabadoobee comes from the Philippines and takes inspiration from Pinoy vocalists as well as indie rock artists like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Alex G. The singer first gained notoriety when placed on a list with other rising acts, like Billie Eilish, and led to beabadoobee touring with Clairo to support her Immunity tour.
Her song, “Coffee” was sampled for a TikTok song, “Death Bed” by Powfu, which is when the singer really made her way into the public spotlight. This last fall she performed at Tyler, the Creator’s music festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, at the event’s biggest stage drawing an audience excited to hear the musician’s live vocals as well as her bass skills.
The highlighted track this week, “Girl Song”, is an emotional piano ballad about body image and self acceptance.


2) Magdalena Bay – “Imaginal Disk” (2024)


Pop duo Magdalena Bay is back with their 3rd studio album, “Imaginal Disk”. Following the release of “Mercurial World” (2021), fans of Magdalena Bay have been waiting to see what the synth-pop duo had in store for their next album. Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.
Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.
The highlighted track, “Tunnel Vision” builds into an intense blend of synths and electric guitars with distorted vocals to emphasize the intense feeling of the song as it builds.


1)Suki Waterhouse – Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” (2024)


Starting out as a model and actress, Suki Waterhouse began releasing music in 2016 with her single, “Brutally”. Some of the works Waterhouse is most recognizable for are her roles in “Love, Rosie”, “Detective Pikachu”, and “Daisy Jones & the Six”.
As she continued balancing her acting and singing careers, her first full-length album, “I Can’t Let Go” wasn’t released until 2022. This latest release, “Memoir Of A Sparklemuffin” comes after the artist opened for Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” at Wembley Stadium.
This week’s highlighted track, “Model, Actress, Whatever” reflects on Waterhouses experiences with growing up and the journey she took to get where she is today.

Expanding on themes previously explored, the new album offers both more personal themes lyrically and a much richer sound on the instrumental side.
Both of us on the music team got to see the duo bring the songs to life on the Denver stop of their “Imaginal Mystery” tour. With elaborate staging, lighting, decor, and costuming the show was truly unforgettable. The album is full of bright spots making it hard to pick just one song to spotlight.
