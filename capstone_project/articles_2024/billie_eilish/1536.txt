There’s major evidence that Sympathy is a Knife featuring Taylor IS happening
This is not a drill. Charli XCX is teasing that Taylor Swift might be on the remix of Sympathy is a Knife – the latest from Brat following the number one smash hit Guess remix with Billie Eilish. From Addison Rae, Robyn, Yung Lean, Lorde to Billie, everyone whose anyone has worked it out on the remix with Charli as Brat takes her to never before seen heights – but there’s one rumour that everyone thought was way out of reach. Well, that reach is suddenly becoming very much tangible. Over the bank holiday, Charli XCX has dropped multiple teasers that she’s about to drop the Sympathy is a Knife remix and Taylor Swift is actually going to be on it. Here’s all you need to know.
ICYYMI, Sympathy is a Knife from Brat has been a big talking point after people interpreted the lyrics to be Taylor Swift shade. The lyrics talk about in the second verse how Charli doesn’t want to see someone “backstage at my boyfriend’s show, fingers crossed behind my back I hope they break up quick”. It was interpreted to be about Taylor Swift due to the fact Charli is engaged to George Daniel of the 1975 and Taylor Swift was briefly dating Matty Healy last year.
Charli maintains it’s not a diss track, and is more about her wn insecurities.

In her huge new profile for New York Magazine, which saw Charli XCX do a shoot with the acclaimed photographer David LaChapelle. Charli hinted that a huge artist has been in touch with her to collab. “Random artists are calling. I can’t say who, but people I greatly respect. It’s like being the new kid in school who people are fascinated by.” Obviously, there is no one bigger than Taylor right now.
Taylor Swift has literally given a quote about Charli XCX to New York Magazine specifically praising Charli. Taylor says “I’ve been blown away by Charli’s melodic sensibilities since I first heard ‘Stay Away’ in 2011. Her writing is surreal and inventive, always. She just takes a song to places you wouldn’t expect it to go, and she’s been doing it consistently for over a decade. I love to see hard work like that pay off.”

Charli was asked by the interviewer if she ever considered taking out the line about bumping into someone backstage at her boyfriend’s show, because the allusion obviously points at Swift. Charli’s reaction has gone viral. She said “No.” The interviewer says the two then sat in silence. “You do the silence game. But I know that well — where you go silent and want me to talk more. But I don’t care about it being awkward. We’ll sit in silence.”
And probaby the biggest: Charli played the publication an “unfinished” remix of Sympathy is Knife. Therefore, we know it literally exists. The lyrics majorly point towards Taylor Swift. “I wrote this three or four weeks ago, about this idea of, like, you have to fall — if you’re deemed to be even in the slightest way on top, you have to fall,” she says. “I’m not a fucking idiot. I know how shit works.”
There’s a new verse, which features the lyrics “It’s a knife when you’re finally on top … / They want to see you fall.”
