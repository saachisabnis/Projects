The secret’s finally out about the identity of Joe Locke’s “Teen” on Agatha All Along.
In the final moments of the show’s fifth episode, which premiered on Wednesday, October 9, Locke’s character was revealed to be Billy Maximoff, one of Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision’s (Paul Bettany) sons, whom fans originally met in WandaVision. According to Locke, 21, several nods to Billy’s parentage were incorporated into the highly anticipated reveal.
“We worked to find similarities in both Billy and Wanda, the way they use their magic,” the actor told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published on Monday, October 14, of working with Olsen’s Marvel movement coach, Jennifer White. “Fans of the comic corner know that Billy’s powers are pretty much the same as Wanda’s with a few differences, so we wanted to find similarities with that, but also his own finesse.”
In addition to sporting a blue crown reminiscent of Wanda’s famous red tiara, Billy’s movements also mimicked how Scarlet Witch uses her magic. “In the script, it was written as ‘with a familiar-looking hand gesture, Teen swipes Agatha off the Road,’” Locke explained. (Not to mention, Locke noted that the Scarlet Witch’s crown is stitched onto the back of his character’s sweater.)
At the end of Agatha All Along episode 5, Agatha (Kathryn Hahn), Lilia (Patti LuPone) and Jennifer (Sasheer Zamata) sank into mysterious mud after being thrown off the Witches Road by Billy in the first display of his powers. Billy’s blue headpiece was revealed as Billie Eilish’s “You Should See Me in a Crown” played.
“At the end of episode 5, we don’t know what happens to those witches, but he’s not doing a good thing. We played a lot with, does that make him a bad person? Is he a good person? Which then draws parallels to the motherly figures in his life,” Locke told EW. “Wanda does evil things but isn’t necessarily evil. Agatha, questionably, is evil, but there’s more to that, as well. We know that he’s been lying to her, and we play a lot with those dynamics of how duplicitous he is. The facade of the fanboy teen, is that completely fake or is that actually still a real part of him? This is the stuff that I found so interesting in playing him.”
Fans will have to wait and see how Locke’s version of Billy (known as Wiccan in the comics) came to be, but a midseason trailer released on Monday offers some hints at his character’s backstory.
The sneak peek shows Locke’s Billy getting into a car crash around the same time as the events of the WandaVision finale, during which Wanda was forced to destroy the versions of Vision and her children she created using her chaos magic. Fans are already theorizing that the spirit of WandaVision’s Billy (played by Julian Hilliard) found its way into Locke’s character’s body when the Scarlet Witch’s spell was broken.

The Heartstopper star, for his part, told EW that he has yet to meet Olsen, 35, whom many fans suspect could make a cameo in Agatha All Along despite being presumed dead after the events of 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
For now, Locke is already thinking of what’s in store for Billy’s future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “In my ideal world, Billy would become the next head of the Avengers and be in every Marvel thing ever, but there are higher things at play,” he stated. “I had the most amazing experience filming on Agatha and being a part of the Marvel family and would love to do that until the day I die. But who knows? I don’t. I’m sure someone does.”
New episodes of Agatha All Along premiere on Disney+ Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.
