Home    Forums    Music    Grammy for Album of the Year (67th Grammy edition)
I’m sorry but this is Beyoncé’s best case scenario. TWO jazz artists so they vote split, Charli smashing with pop so she’s taking votes away from Sabrina, Chappell and Billie (which already were prone to vote splitting) and BRAT’s domination makes me feel like it got some alt voters on its side too. Plus, pop voters clearly must have liked CC too, especially with Levii’s beating a R/SOTY *searched for* nominee in Pop Duo.
The last time we had a massive vote split with pop, the jazz/Americana combo of Jon Batiste won. 
Jazz will vote split, so Beyoncé is getting all Americana + country + R&B (no one close to R&B heew so they’ll namecheck their fav) and probably Rap cuz, let’s be real, rap voters are not going for the Andre fully instrumental flute record. Not to mention some pop.
And of course, let’s not be naïve about the current state of the US and how this album could in some ways resonate. I still hold that it won’t be as political as a TPAB or This Is America, but nonetheless it’s got some aspects of that.
This is easily her best shot since IASF. 
Music genre breakdown:
New Blue Sun – New Age and Jazz
Cowboy Carter – Country and Americana
Short ‘n Sweet – Pop
BRAT – Dance
Djesse Vol. 4 – Pop
HIT ME HARD AND SOFT – Pop
The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess – Pop
TTPD – Pop

It only boils down to Beyoncé whether or not she will campaign during the final round voting. Time will tell.

Will Win: Cowboy Carter
Should Win: Cowboy Carter
Could Win: Short N Sweet/Brat
Honey, we can immediately rule out André 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan, and Taylor Swift. This is Beyoncé’s best shot at finally winning Album of the Year. However, old white voters will pass her up as usual. Leaving Billie Eilish as the victor. SHOULD WIN: None WILL WIN: Billie Eilish, Hit Me Hard and Soft 
 lmao….no one should win? The category should be closed on the awards night? 😂😂😂. I swear I’m a big fan of yours

Will win: Hit Me Hard And Soft
Could win: The Tortured Poets Department
Should win: Cowboy Carter
Shouldn’t have been nominated: Brat (it’s beyond overrated. Crap)

Chappel Roan is winning this award, you heard it here first. She will win 5 Grammys in February.
Will Win: Billie
Should Win: Cowboy Carter
Could Win: Brat
COWBOY CARTER ALBUM OF THE YEAR
Look out for Andre. 
tbh, this would be the most inspired win. And it would be hilarious too.
I think Beyoncé will finally win. She’s the only country nominee in AOTY . No one can take a chunk of votes from her. Andre is a non factor here AND won’t do hurt her chances. I’m positive that the R&B voters will go with her 100% in AOTY. She has the Country, Americana & Pop Support.
Beyoncé will win for the wrong album, as always, but it’s finally her time.
I still think Sabrina could upset. If not, don’t rule out Taylor because the Grammys is Grammys.

Honey, we go through this every time Beyoncé is nominated in Album of the Year.  This time will NOT be any different.

Pin this. Hang this on a wall.
I kind of wish Jacob to take this just so everyone would be gagged a la “Just Like That” 🫢
