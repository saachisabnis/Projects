Libby Tisler’s sound is one that is very much of the “now.” One would imagine that she’s an admirer of the songwriting of Taylor Swift, perhaps Lorde and Billie Eilish. Not that she sounds like any one of them, but the influence of those artists can be heard on her sweet, pained heartfelt indie-pop. 
Songs like “The Artist” and “End of an Era” come across like journal entires set to music, but they’re not at all hokey. Moreover, the songs are expertly constructed and beautifully produced. “End of an Era” builds with an admirable restraint, reminiscent of Swift’s “All Too Well.” One senses it’s going to be wonderful watching Tisler’s star rise.
