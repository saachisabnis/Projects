Ever since her debut in 1959, the Barbie doll has captured the hearts of children around the world.
When the “Barbie” movie starring Margot Robbie hit theaters in July 2023, the beloved doll became even more of a cultural icon.
Infused with humor, emotional depth and the color pink, “Barbie” follows one doll's journey from Barbie Land into the Real World, where she battles the patriarchy, helps a mother and daughter reconnect, and finds her purpose.
Beneath its saccharine veneer, “Barbie” delves into some seriously deep topics. Let's be honest: we all shed a tear or two while Billie Eilish's Oscar-winning ballad “What Was I Made For” played over poignant flashback scenes.
There's no shortage of inspiration, either: America Ferrera's character Gloria stole the show with her passionate monologue about the difficulties of modern womanhood.
Amidst the multitude of Barbies (there's President Barbie, Physicist Barbie, and Lawyer Barbie, to name a few), Ryan Gosling’s Ken has his share of hilarious hijinks —  including an iconic musical number — as he tries to figure out his place in Barbie Land.
Whether you're seen the movie or not, there's a “Barbie” line that resonates with everyone. These “Barbie” quotes will bring a little bit of movie magic into your world.
