For the latest instalment of Kellyoke, on her daytime TV show, Kelly Clarkson sang a cover of The Last Dinner Party's "Nothing Matters".
The debut single from The Last Dinner Party features on their debut album, Prelude To Ecstasy, which came out earlier this year, and made history as the biggest debut number one album by a band in nine years, following Years & Years managed with their debut LP Communion.
Sophie Ellis-Bextor also took on the song during a recent appearance on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.
Other covers on Clarkson's Kellyoake segment have included "What Was I Made For?" by Billie Eilish, "Stayaway" by MUNA, Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You", Taylor's Swift's "Better Man", "The One That Got Away" by Katy Perry, "9-to-5" by Dolly Parton, and "Free" by Florence + the Machine.
Prelude to Ecstacy is out now via Island Records.
