(CNN) - A handful of stars on the Oscars red carpet wore red lapel pins, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.
Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, Billie Eilish, Riz Ahmed and Ava DuVernay were among the stars who stepped onto the red carpet in matching red lapel pins.
Featuring an outline of a hand around a black heart, the pins call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, which Palestinian health authorities say has resulted in 30,000 deaths in Gaza since October.
A group of over 400 celebrities have joined Artists4Ceasefire, a campaign that in late October published a letter urging the U.S. Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel.
In a press statement, Artists4Ceasefire said, “The pin symbolizes collective support for an immediate and permanent cease-fire, the release of all of the hostages and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.”
