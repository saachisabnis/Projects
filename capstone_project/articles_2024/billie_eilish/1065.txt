Luminate released their 2024 midyear music report, which revealed that Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Billie Eilish have had the most successful year so far based on their U.S. album sales. The report deciphers trends from the year based on a series of figures, determining that musicians benefitted from streaming services along with physical sales, which were boosted by the releases of multiple variants that substantially added to an artist’s total sales. Their findings show that the top 10 U.S. physical albums had an average of seven different LP variants, 13 CDs, and two cassettes. 
The Tortured Poets Department recorded the highest sales in the U.S. with 4.66 million total album-equivalent units, followed by Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time, Noah Kahan’s Stick Season, Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, and SZA’s SOS. Regarding total sales, TTPD is top again, followed by Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft, Cowboy Carter, and Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) and Lover. (Variety)
