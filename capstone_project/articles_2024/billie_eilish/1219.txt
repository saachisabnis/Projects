Last week, Rihanna revealed that Billie Eilish was her dream collaborator during an interview with Access Hollywood after being asked "who's your dream collaborator to sing with?"
"If I could only do a song with Billie Eilish," Rihanna responded without hesitation. "Mm-mm, she’s so good."
"billie is gonna lose her s**t when she sees this," one fan remarked on an Instagram post about the comment, and they were right! Billie took to Instagram story to share her f-word laden reaction, writing: "what in the absolute f*** oh my god what the f***"
Honestly, that's probably what the general reaction would be if these two icons did release a song together. Somebody, make it happen! For now, check out Rihanna's interview and Billie's reaction below.
Warning: Explicit language
As much as we all now want a Rihanna x Billie collab, what fans really want is any new music from the hitmaker. Her last album was 2016's Anti and last new song was 2022's "Lift Me Up" for the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack. Rihanna last gave fans an update about her ninth album, referred to as "R9," in April. 
"I have a lot of visual ideas," she explained at the time. "It’s weird. My brain is working backward right now. I usually have the music first, and the music leads me into all of these visual opportunities, and now I’m having all of these visuals, and I don’t have the songs for them yet, but maybe that’s the key, this time. Maybe the visual ideas are leading me to the songs that I need to make." 
Meanwhile, Billie released her third album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, in May.
