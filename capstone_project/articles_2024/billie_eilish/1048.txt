Hit us hard and soft — and do it in surround sound. 
Billie Eilish has announced a slew of advance listening events for her forthcoming album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, allowing fans to hear the record “with a visual accompaniment” one day before it arrives. “HIT ME HARD AND SOFT – A Listening Event Presented by Apple Music” will take place next Thursday (May 16) at 100-plus AMC Theaters nationwide, with select theaters hosting events on Friday as well. Thus far, the third album from alt-pop star has remained completely under wraps, with no singles to prime listeners for its May 17 arrival.
Four Massachusetts theaters will host listening events next Thursday, including two in the Boston area: AMC Boston Common and AMC Assembly Row in Somerville. Folks who live outside of the city can also attend gatherings at AMC’s Liberty Tree Mall location in Danvers and the chain’s Methuen theater. All four showings begin at 3 p.m. and will last one hour. Tickets cost $5 and will partially benefit the AMC Cares Charitable Fund.
The listening event announcement follows news of Eilish’s 2024 world tour, which pulls up to TD Garden on October 11.
