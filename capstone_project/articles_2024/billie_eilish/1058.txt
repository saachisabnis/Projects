WASHINGTON (TNND)  â€” Rockstar Bruce Springsteen endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris Thursday becoming the latest celebrity to back the vice president against Donald Trump.
Some big names in Hollywood have already endorsed the vice president including Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Barbara Streisand.
The "Born to Run" singer shared a video on Instagram saying "Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime."
In the past, the 75-year-old campaigned for former President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Walz expressed his excitement about the endorsement on X and thanked "The Boss" for his support.
"Wow. As a lifelong fan of The Boss, I couldn't be more honored to have his support," the vice presidential candidate wrote.
Springsteen ended his video by saying he respects people's choices but called his vote one of his most precious possessions.
"Now, everybody sees things different and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen. But like you, I've only got one vote, and it's one of the most precious possessions that I have. That's why come November 5 I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Thanks for listening."
