	Finneas is back with his sophomore album, For Cryin’ Out Loud, which arrived on Friday (Oct. 4).

	The project was preceded by the title track, “Cleats” and “Lotus Eater,” and follows the Grammy-winning producer’s 2021 debut album, Optimist. 

	“This album, I was like, I want to sit across the table from people and talk right to them and not be preachy at all,” the 27-year-old star told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe of For Cryin’ Out Loud!. “So, anything like ‘Little Window,’ for example, you compare that to a song on the first album like ‘The Kids Are All Dying,’ which is about the same thing basically, but it’s a wide gesture. ‘Little Window’ is really about my relationship with humanity through social media. So, trying to get to a place where I can be more forthcoming about how it is for me specifically and worry less about how it is for everybody or trying to be sort of universally intelligent, which I’m not.”

	Beyond his own works, Finneas has produced all three of sister Billie Eilish’s albums, from her breakthrough 2019 debut, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? — which featured such beloved tracks as “You Should See Me In a Crown,” “When the Party’s Over” and “Bad Guy” — as well 2021’s Happier Than Ever and this year’s Hit Me Hard and Soft.
