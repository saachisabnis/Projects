	Since the chart’s September 2023 inception, Mitski’s “My Love Mine All Mine” had been the only song to rule for at least six weeks, stringing together three-week leads between Oct. 14-28, 2023, and Nov. 18-Dec. 2, 2023.

	The rule of “Million Dollar Baby” has occurred consecutively; it achieved the longest such streak at No. 1 upon the June 15 chart with its fifth frame in a row.

	“Million Dollar Baby” was officially released April 26, though its premiere on TikTok came when Richman uploaded a snippet of the track on April 13, a clip that’s since accrued 13 million views as of June 18. A dance trend has been a major driver of activity on TikTok since.
It was sooo romantic but i straight up didnt know what was going on for a sec #cutie #boyfriend #birthday 

	Richman fends off a challenge from Sabrina Carpenter, whose “Please Please Please” vaults to No. 2 in its second week after debuting at No. 10. That’s concurrent with the newly released tune’s No. 2 debut on the multimetric Billboard Hot 100.

	“Please Please Please” was first teased on TikTok on June 5, followed by its full release June 7. Its uploads are a grab bag of content, from makeup tutorials and transitions to lip-synching clips and general-interest videos.

	In the week ending June 13, “Please Please Please” earned 50.3 million official U.S. streams, 533,000 radio audience impressions and 7,000 downloads toward the Hot 100, according to Luminate.

	“Please Please Please” isn’t the only song to hit the TikTok Billboard Top 50’s top three for the first time. Tinashe’s “Nasty” climbs 7-3, a new peak in its fifth week on the tally.

	










	A slow burner since its initial April 12 release, “Nasty” has risen on TikTok due to a dance trend soundtracked by the tune’s “I’ve been a nasty girl” refrain.

	“Nasty” reaches a new peak of No. 69 on the latest Hot 100, Tinashe’s highest ranking song on the tally since “2 On,” featuring ScHoolboy Q, reached No. 24 a decade earlier.

Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” falls from No. 3 to No. 4 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50, while Sexyy Red and Drake’s “U My Everything” drops from No. 2 to No. 5 to round out the top five.

	After debuting at No. 15 on the June 15-dated list, NXY0TAR0’s “Porsche” leads a pair of newcomers to the chart’s top 10, jumping 15-9. The song’s trend involves using a filter filling the screen with floating hearts while a clip of the uploader plays and rewinds on a loop. It’s often accompanied by a captioned compliment (“I like your smile,” “I like your eyes,” etc.).

	Sexyy Red’s “Fake Jammin” is the other top 10 newcomer, lifting one spot to No. 10. Uploads featuring the song generally use the “We go together now, mwah, give me a kiss/ Bitch, you know I’m hella sexy” lyric, with lip synchs, dances and more.
