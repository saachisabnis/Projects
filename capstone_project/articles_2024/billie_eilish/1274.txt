Chappell Roan’s swift rise to fame in 2024 has been nothing short of spectacular to witness. From her humble beginnings on YouTube to winning the coveted VMA for Best New Artist, Roan has carved out a space in pop music that is refreshingly unique and unapologetically queer.
At the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, Roan delivered a fiery performance of her hit single "Good Luck, Babe," introduced by drag icon Sasha Colby. The night was one to remember as she took home the award for Best New Artist and completed her first major TV award show performance, an important milestone in any artist's career.
Chappell Roan’s journey began when she uploaded her original song "Die Young" on YouTube at 17. Soon after, she was signed to Atlantic Records, a testament to her raw talent and unique voice.
However, it wasn’t until her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, through Island Records in 2023 that she began making significant waves. Though not an immediate commercial success, the album was praised critically and found its footing as a "sleeper hit" by early 2024.
The album's breakthrough was heavily influenced by her stint as a supporting act on Olivia Rodrigo's Guts World Tour, her electrifying performances at major music festivals like Coachella and Governors Ball, and the subsequent release of "Good Luck, Babe!"
By mid-2024, the album surged worldwide, reaching number one in Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK and breaking into the top five on the US Billboard 200 and Australia. Singles from the album began entering various charts for the first time since their release, further solidifying her status as a breakout star.

The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess was featured in several best albums of 2023 year-end lists, including those by The A.V. Club, Time, Nylon, Dork, Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Vogue. Named Pop Buzz's Number One Album of 2023, the record encapsulates Roan’s musical journey and unique narrative, resonating with fans across the globe.
Putting together her first major award show performance was no small feat. Roan wanted to make a statement reflecting her musical style and bold, inclusive message for the VMAs.
Inspired by 1980s synth-pop and early 2000s pop hits, her "Good Luck, Babe" performance was a contemporary spectacle that transported the audience into her world—a blend of glitter, guts, and glam (performing in a full suit of armor is not easy to pull off). Choreography, visual effects, and stage design were meticulously crafted to showcase her magnetic stage presence and dynamic vocal ability. Backed by a team of dancers and styled in a look that was “very Chappell,” she captivated viewers, leaving them wanting more, which she fully gave when she accepted her award dressed as Joan of Arc.
“Good Luck, Babe,” introduced by Sasha Colby, set the tone for an unforgettable night. The song, which Roan described as "the first song of the next chapter," has become a breakout hit, quickly rising through the charts and reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 by August. It became her first top-ten hit on the chart and her fastest song to reach 100 million streams on Spotify. The song’s success at the VMAs was a testament to Roan's ability to captivate both the audience and industry insiders.
Winning the VMA for Best New Artist, a career-defining achievement that has previously been awarded to the likes of Nirvana, Eminem, Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, was more than just a personal victory for Roan—it was a celebration for the community she passionately represents.
Dedicating her win to “the queer and trans people who fuel pop,” Roan has positioned herself not just as an artist but as a beacon for inclusivity and representation in the music industry.

Roan’s music spans queerness, self-discovery, and empowerment, drawing inspiration from legends like Stevie Nicks, alt-J, Ellie Goulding, Lorde, and Lana Del Rey. With her distinctive sound and unapologetic stance on social issues, she has captured the hearts (and, likely, the Spotify wrapped throne) for both Millennials and Gen Z this year. Roan’s sound celebrates the queerness that pop music seems to have lost in recent years and brings a refreshing authenticity to the current music scene.
Beyond her music, Roan has become known for her outspoken stance on various social issues, which has only endeared her more to her fanbase. She famously declined an invitation from the White House to perform for the 2024 Pride celebration, stating, "We want liberty, justice, and freedom for all. When you do that, that's when I'll come," citing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and transgender rights. Her bold stance on issues of equality and justice further propels her popularity among "the people," particularly among the younger generations who prefer public figures who are authentic and actively involved in issues that matter.

Her journey from a teenager uploading songs on YouTube to becoming 2024’s Breakthrough Artist is both inspiring and a reflection of a new era in music. Roan has created a space that feels fresh, vital and necessary.
Her rise is a reminder that authenticity, talent, and a little bit of rebelliousness can provide a place in a competitive industry that is constantly evolving. The world better get used to hearing Chappell Roan’s name—this Midwest Princess isn’t going anywhere.
