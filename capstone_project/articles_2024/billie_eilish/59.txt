Billie Eilish is feeling the heat after saying artists are releasing “wasteful” vinyls.
During an interview with Billboard, published on Thursday (March 28), Billie said, “I can’t even express to you how wasteful it is. It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable — and then it’s some of the biggest artists in the world making f**king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more. It’s so wasteful, and it’s irritating to me that we’re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money — and it’s all your favorite artists doing that s**t.”
Billie has since addressed her comments following backlash she’s received, writing her on Instagram Story on Sunday (March 31), “I wasn’t singling anyone out, these are industrywide systemic issues & when it comes to variants, so many artists release them—including ME!”
She continued, “The climate crisis is now and its about all of us being part of the problem and trying to do better. Stop putting words in my mouth and actually read what i said,” adding, “Sheesh.”
