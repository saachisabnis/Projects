Charli XCX has officially joined the Converse team.
The musician revealed the news on her Instagram account, and the partnership is one of the latest as it pertains to the brand’s growing lineup of celebrity collaborations. Having had an incredibly successful 2024 thus far with the release of her sixth studio album “Brat” in June (which sparked a major fashion trend over the summer), the artist has become known for her epic footwear choices, making this the perfect partnership.
The partnership kicks off with Charli celebrating her love for the Chuck Taylor All Star. She stars in a holiday campaign, which was shot by photographer Sharna Osborne.

Charli joins a Converse family of creators that already includes Tyler, The Creator, Billie Eilish, pgLang, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Alexis Sablone, Rick Owens, and Isabel Marant among others. More details about the collaboration are set to come in the coming months.
 “I wear my Chucks so much they have holes in them, so I was really excited to work with Converse so I could get a new pair. They’re iconic,” the singer said in a statement. 
As far as other Converse collaboration updates, Billie Eilish also unveiled a new footwear collaboration with the brand a couple of weeks ago. The singer shared a picture of herself via social media on Oct. 15 holding a shoe reading “And Soft” on the bottom, which is a nod to her most recent album “Hit Me Hard and Soft.”
Having been regularly seen in Converse throughout the years, the brand then confirmed shortly afterwards that Eilish’s designs of the Chuck Taylor All Star ($100) and Chuck Taylor All Star Lift Platform ($110) models would be available on their website, with fans being able to tweak Eilish’s Converse designs to their liking using lyrics, colors and graphics from “Hit Me Hard and Soft.”
Aside from Charli XCX and Eilish, Converse also works with the likes of NBA superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, rapper and entrepreneur Tyler the Creator, legendary fashion designer Rick Owens and more.
A release date for Charli XCX x Converse is expected in the near future.
