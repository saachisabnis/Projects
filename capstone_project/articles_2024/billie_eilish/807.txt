"I had a vocal cord issue that I didn't know I had, and I had to have a blood vessel lasered off my vocal cord," he said. "It was nothing that you would have noticed, but I noticed it. And I said, 'I don't want to have any hiccups going into this record and this tour.'" 
The documentary, which is directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, will chronicle Bon Jovi's career from his humble beginnings in New Jersey to his global fame and success. It will also feature interviews with band members, collaborators, friends, and family, as well as rare archival footage and photos.
