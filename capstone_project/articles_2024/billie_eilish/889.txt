Billie Eilish and FINNEAS can undoubtedly write hit songs together, but can they write one with a classroom of first graders? That was the duo's task in the latest episode of Celebrity Substitute.
The musicians surprised a first grade class at Garvanza Elementary, which happens to be in Highland Park—the Los Angeles neighborhood the siblings grew up in.  After choosing a chord progression they liked—every kid was impressed with FINNEAS' A chord on the keyboard—they cycled through topics ranging from "freaky" to Kendrick Lamar before landing on snow. They then agreed the song should be about a polar bear, and after one girl suggested that the polar bear "got cheated on," Billie toned it down to a generally sad song about the polar bear being alone. That is, until it makes friends with a snowman!
After they got the music, lyrics and melody down, it was time to perform "I'm Just A Polar Bear" for the kids' teacher. Watch the whole adorable episode below.
Eilish kicked off her HIT ME HARD AND SOFT tour in September, marking the first time she's ever toured without her brother FINNEAS. The "Birds of a Feather" singe plays her final show of the year on Saturday (December 21) at Los Angeles' Kia Forum. Next year she'll take the tour internationally while FINNEAS embarks on his own 2025 tour.
