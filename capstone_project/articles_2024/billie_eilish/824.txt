Billie Eilish's third album Hit Me Hard and Soft officially comes out on May 17, but some fans will get a chance to hear it before its release. On Monday (May 6), she announced two massive listening parties: one at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on May 15 and one at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on May 16. The tickets are free and can be requested via Ticketmaster. Fans have until May 7 at 12pm EST/9am PST to request tickets and confirmations will go out on May 10. (Requests do not guarantee tickets.)
Eilish decided not to share any singles before the album's release, and explained her decision in a recent interview. “Every single time an artist I love puts out a single without the context of the album, I’m just already prone to hating on it. I really don’t like when things are out of context. This album is like a family: I don’t want one little kid to be in the middle of the room alone.”
She plans to head out on an extensive world tour in support of the album that kicks off this fall and goes until July 2025. You can see the full list of tour dates here.
