The European edition of the festival will take place next June
South By Southwest (SXSW) has confirmed that a London edition of the festival will be taking place in 2025.
Self-described as “the world’s leading festival celebrating the convergence of creativity, culture and technology”, the UK version of the event is set to take place in a week across June.
SXSW London will take over dozens of venues, galleries, clubs and other spaces in Shoreditch. The location was chosen for its vibrant culture, emphasis on creativity and technological innovation, as well as its diversity, global cuisine and nightlife.
The wait is over, the cat's out of the bag, the world’s most incredible creativity and tech event is coming to Europe. London, June 2025

The new edition of SXSW expands the footprint of the cultural platform created over almost four decades in Austin, Texas. It also gives SXSW – which was founded in 1987 – a presence in Europe. Before this, it had previously expanded into the Asia Pacific region last year, with SXSW Sydney in 2023.
As well as continuing to welcome the world’s leading speakers, which have previously included Barack Obama, Dave Grohl, Steven Spielberg, Tilda Swinton and more, the UK edition promises to “bring its own distinctive personality, driven by London’s internationally renowned cultural life and creativity, its status as a global meeting place, and its proximity to other major creative and tech centres in Europe”.
In addition to the keynotes and innovations in tech, the event will showcase a range of musical performances from both big names and emerging talent. In the past, this has seen performances that have helped propel artists including Amy Winehouse, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Skepta, Stormzy and Wet Leg.
“As a life-long fan of SXSW I truly believe that it’s more than an event – it’s a movement, a platform where the world’s greatest minds, musicians and motivators come to share their passion and their vision of the future,” said Randel Bryan, Managing Director of SXSW London.
“SXSW London will build on Austin’s incredible legacy, presenting an event that underpins why SXSW is the go-to destination for professionals and creatives seeking meaningful connections, unexpected experiences and ideas that can help shape the world.
“SXSW London will also provide a platform for the next generation of creative talent and we will be working hard to ensure that opportunities for learning, employment and community uplift are at the heart of everything we do.”
Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, also added: “I am delighted to welcome SXSW to London for the first time ever – confirming our place at the heart of Europe’s tech and creative sectors and as a global capital of culture.
“When I was part of SXSW in Austin in 2018, I saw first-hand the electric atmosphere of innovation SXSW creates and I can’t wait to be part of it again.  This is a historic opportunity for London to once again bring the world’s most exciting talent together as part of our mission to build a better and more prosperous London for everyone.”
In its upcoming London instalment, SXSW will continue to focus on climate action and sustainability, in the same way it has done in Austin over the years.
Further details about SXSW London 2025 will be announced over the coming months, and badges are set to go on sale in October. You can find out more about the event and register on the festival’s official website.
The 2024 edition of SXSW took place in March, and faced a number of challenges after it came to light that the US Army was a “super sponsor” of the week-long event, and numerous artists called off their sets in protest of the military’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza.
Acts including Kneecap, Lambrini Girls, and Rachel Chinouriri pulled out of the event, and NME later went on to describe this year’s instalment as “mired in confusion and controversy”.
