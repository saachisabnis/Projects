While "Rogue" embodies Vincent's commitment to pushing the boundaries of R&B and Pop, it also serves as the lead track off his eagerly anticipated EP. Vincent says about the EP, “I started the process back in 2016 and I called the EP ‘FOR WHEN IT’S OVER’ to document what love/lust feels like within this generation of quick attention spans and dating apps. In a world of instant gratification, genuine fulfillment in love doesn’t really exist.” The EP encapsulates these sentiments in under 20 minutes, reflecting on intense yet short-lived relationships, now normalized in our society.
