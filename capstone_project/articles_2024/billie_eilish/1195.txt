Billie Eilish is officially coming to Fortnite. The singer herself confirmed the longstanding rumors on social media, posting a picture of her character in the game and teasing a main stage appearance this week. Eilish will take to the Main Stage inside Fortnite Festival on April 23.
For what it's worth, Billie Eilish's appearance in Fortnite has been rumored for years now. Epic Games re-shared Eilish's social media post but has not yet offered other details about the event.

Fortnite Festival is the rhythm game within Fortnite's launcher developed by Rock Band studio Harmonix. The Weeknd and Lady Gaga have graced the Main Stage so far, and Eilish will be next.
Players can currently use a controller to jam along to popular songs, or buy the PDP Riffmaster guitar to rock out in style.
Fortnite Festival debuted in 2023 alongside Lego Fortnite as new games that exist as standalone products within the Fortnite launcher. Epic Games is trying to create its own metaverse and make Fortnite one platform that offers a variety of offerings. Also in the works is a Disney world within Fortnite, which is being worked on now after Disney paid Epic $1.5 billion.
