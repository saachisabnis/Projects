Messages were made to be heard. But getting brand messages where they need to be is easier said than done. More types of media, new ad formats, and an increasing number of devices are compounding the age-old challenge for advertisers: reaching the right audiences, at the right time, with the right message. And with so many media options available, many brands wonder if they’re duplicating reach by incorporating more channels.
With over three in four Americans ages 12+ listening to digital audio monthly and listeners tuning in nearly five hours daily, the medium is an excellent way for advertisers to reach audiences consistently. In its recent report, “Just Add Audio,” which includes data from a new study conducted with Edison Research, SiriusXM Media explores the power and position of digital audio, demonstrating its ability to amplify other elements of your integrated campaigns.
AM/FM radio can be an effective tool for reaching listeners in a specific area or fans of a particular syndicated show. But it’s not always the most convenient entertainment option for listeners, especially when they leave the car.
And, even at the local level, terrestrial radio’s reach is broad. Though the medium can provide mass audience exposure, with its limited targeting options, many impressions are wasted on listeners who are unlikely to buy the products or services advertised.
If you want to reach specific consumers and scale to wider audiences, you need digital audio in your media mix. Digital audio provides the personal, curated, on-demand experiences that listeners can take anywhere, which is why its popularity continues to grow. These personalized listening environments mean better targeting options to help advertisers reach the right audience and connect with them through custom messaging.
Using AM/FM and digital audio in combination gives advertisers incremental campaign reach. For example, adding SiriusXM Media to a terrestrial radio buy offers +18 percentage reach points.
Though viewership isn’t what it used to be, linear TV still brings viewers the big moments: sporting events, award shows, newsworthy interviews, and those infamous reality TV tell-alls.
These events are some of the few remaining unifying experiences that reach massive audiences across demographics and geographic areas. But that large reach often comes at an even larger cost for advertisers.
Digital audio allows you to extend those cultural moments for days and weeks after the initial event. For example, the Olympic Summer Games closing ceremony drove a 129% increase in Billie Eilish station adds on Pandora. From live talk shows rehashing every play and detail, to podcasts covering the ceremonies from another angle to a song performance played on repeat, the impact of TV’s biggest moments reverberates with digital audio.
Leveraging traditional TV and digital audio together gives audiences wider reach. The “Just Add Audio” report demonstrates how SiriusXM and its streaming and podcast networks add +26 points of incremental reach to linear TV.
Many television viewers have flocked to CTV for its flexibility, control, and content options. And advertisers are following them, hoping to reach large, engaged audiences.
But with the fragmentation in the space, reaching viewers consistently can be challenging. Streaming sites and services, smart TV firmware, CTV platforms—no matter what or how audiences are watching, they’re often juggling services and devices.
Much of what there is to love about CTV, advertisers can find with digital audio. Both formats deliver growing audiences, logged-in users, non-skippable ads, measurable performance, and flexible pricing models. And consumers enjoy reliable access to the songs and shows they want, anywhere, anytime, including when screens are nowhere to be seen. Digital audio can connect you with audiences at scale while also complementing your CTV buys. And research show that CTV campaigns do better with digital audio.
Not only can adding digital audio to CTV or OTT strengthen campaigns, but it can also add incremental reach (e.g., adding SiriusXM Media delivers anywhere from +14 points to +50 points, depending on the service).
From baby boomers right down to Gen Alpha, it seems like everyone is on some form of social media. It’s the go-to brain break on busy days, a boredom killer while waiting in line, and a welcome distraction when the TV ads start to roll.
But, for advertisers, it’s all about stopping the scroll, which the pace of social feeds doesn’t make easy. Algorithms are tuned to keep users happy with a steady stream of videos, images, and ads (all of which are easy to miss or skip entirely). And though many advertisers turn to the medium for its influencer marketing abilities, trust in the content is dwindling.
You can bolster your brand messages with digital audio. The intimate listening environment fosters deeper connections with listeners that advertisers can tap into. According to Soundboard and Podsurvey user studies from SiriusXM Media, audiences find streaming audio to be 4.7X more authentic and trustworthy than social media—and podcasts to be 23X more so.
With digital audio, you can also build 360-degree campaigns that incorporate social media components to reach and influence audiences through fully integrated campaigns that combine audio, visuals, and even IRL events.
Social media and digital audio can also work together to further your overall campaign reach. For example, combining SiriusXM Media with platforms like Instagram (+19 points), TikTok (+29 points), or X (+34 points) helps your ads reach wider audiences.
You can even add digital audio to digital audio. It isn’t one thing, and its audiences are not a monolith—which means there are more ways to leverage the medium to reach them. It’s talk radio in the morning or on a lunch break, it’s streaming audio while working out or doing chores, and it’s podcasts on a walk or winding down.
Studies show that layering different kinds of audio delivers incremental reach for advertisers. For example, DoorDash added podcasts to its streaming audio buy with SiriusXM Media, it saw +70% incremental reach, with 64% of all attributable actions deemed to be incremental.
If you’re looking to add reach and efficiency to your next campaign, look no further than digital audio.
