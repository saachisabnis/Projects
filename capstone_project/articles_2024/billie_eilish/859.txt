In a new cover story interview with Complex, Billie Eilish returned the praise that Rihanna said about her back in October. “If I could only do a song with Billie Eilish, she’s so good,” RiRi gushed during a recent Fenty launch event, an interview clip that Eilish said she “literally thought … was AI.” The two-time Oscar winner was quick to return the compliments to the “We Found Love” singer and fashion mogul. “I’ve never met Rihanna,” Eilish admits. “She’s literally my idol. She’s the greatest of all time. She’s my complete dream collab.” Eilish says she typically doesn’t answer questions about who she’d like to collaborate with, but she secretly had RiRi in the back of her mind. “I always think Rihanna,” Eilish says, before modestly continuing. “I’m not going to say that, though! Why would I say that?! It’s not real. I’ve never heard from her, and I’ve never had any interaction with her, so why would I have ever even thought about it?” (Billboard)
