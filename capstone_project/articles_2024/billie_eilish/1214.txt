Billie Eilish has just become only the third artist in music history to reach 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify. The 22-year-old Grammy and Oscar-winner is also the youngest artist to reach that impressive milestone. Eilish joins the Weeknd at 107 million monthly listeners, and Taylor Swift at 102 million, as the only musicians to break the 100 million mark. What makes Eilish’s achievement even more astounding is that she only has 82 songs streaming on the platform, with both the Weeknd and Swift having more than double the amount of Billie’s total songs available on Spotify. 
“Spotify has been a part of Billie’s story from the start. Ever since ‘Ocean Eyes,’ she has continuously grown her fan base around the world,” said Jeremy Erlich, Spotify’s global head of music. “What she and [brother-collaborator] Finneas have achieved since 2016 is quite remarkable…and all this by the age of 22.” (Billboard)
