Kylie Jenner commanded attention in her dazzling red Oscars gown as she posed for snaps following the Vanity Fair bash.
The reality star, 26, took to Instagram on Monday to share a couple of pictures in the curve-clinging red dress after a night mingling with the biggest stars in Hollywood.
The mother-of-two put on a busty display in the thin strappy garment, adorned with a silver leaf motif.
With no sign of her boyfriend Timothee Chalamet, Kylie attended the Beverly Hills soiree with her mother Kris Jenner and sisters Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian.
Reflecting on her spectacular night, Kylie captioned her Instagram snaps: 'About last night'.

Her glossy black hair featured a dramatic side part and dangled seductively over her complexion.  
Her eyes radiated with a dusting of shimmering eye shadow while blush and a touch of lip gloss enhanced her natural beauty.
The reality star also rocked a flawless light pink manicure and glittering silver earrings.
Kylie has been dating Timothee since last spring, but the couple have not been seen together for two months, leading anxious fans to speculate that the pair have broken up.
She recently deflected a question about her boyfriend during an interview with the New York Times.
During the chat, she spoke about how her dress sense changed about a year ago, once she had gotten her 'body back' after her pregnancy with her son Aire. 
She was then asked about the social media rumors that her style transformation was actually due to her romance with Timothee.
'I don’t know how I feel about that,' she replied, swatting the subject away by saying: 'I just don’t want to talk about personal things.'

Their last public sighting was at the Golden Globes in early January, when they set the internet ablaze by engaging in a public display of affection on camera.
The breakup rumors reached a fever pitch last week, when Kylie posted a TikTok of her daily routine with her daughter Stormi, six, and sister Kendall.
Fans sprang into the comments to share their theories about how Kylie was showing the world she was flourishing as a single mother in order to 'soft-launch' a breakup.
Kylie and Timothee went public with their romance while attending a Beyonce show in early September, following months of dating rumors.
