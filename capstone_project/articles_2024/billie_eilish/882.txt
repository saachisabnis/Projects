	This Barbie loves Ken!

Kristen Stewart appeared on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast recently, which was recorded one day after the 2024 Academy Awards, which she revealed that she watched from home. The Twilight actress added that Ryan Gosling’s standout “I’m Just Ken” performance particularly moved her. 

	“I was, for some reason, crying and laughing while watching the Ken thing. It’s emotional, dude, watching Greta [Gerwig] watch it. When they did the one cutaway of her and she was just, like, front-row belting and looking at the thing she helped kickstart,” Stewart noted, adding that she’s a “super-duper fan” of the 2023 Barbie film.

	Following Barbie‘s theatrical release in July, “I’m Just Ken” debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 87 — making Gosling a charting artist on the ranking for the first time. In the popular film, the high-energy, multi-set scene finds the Notebook actor singing his heart out about his “blond fragility” alongside Simu Liu and a number other Kens.
