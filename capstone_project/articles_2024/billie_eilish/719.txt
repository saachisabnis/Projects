The Celebrity Beat…
Billie Eilish is very much into self-love.  The PHYSICAL kind.  And she’s very vocal about it in a new profile in “Rolling Stone“.  She says, quote, “I should have a Ph.D.”
She adds, quote, “Self-pleasure is an enormous, enormous part of my life, and a huge, huge help for me… I can’t stress it enough, as somebody with extreme body issues and dysmorphia that I’ve had my entire life.”
She particularly enjoys doing it in front of a mirror.  Quote, “I have learned that looking at myself and watching myself feel pleasure has been an extreme help in loving myself and accepting myself, and feeling empowered and comfortable.”
