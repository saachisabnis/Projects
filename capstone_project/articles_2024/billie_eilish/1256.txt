Hailey Bieber is setting the tone for her pregnancy style.
On Friday, May 24, the Rhode founder, 27, who announced earlier this month that she is expecting her first baby with husband Justin Bieber, 30, shared a carousel of photos on her Instagram from the couple's trip to Japan.
In one photo, Hailey wears a yellow knit hat and a yellow crop top, donning low rise pants that show off her growing bump. Another photo shows the model in a leather vest and leather jacket, both unbuttoned to show off her stomach.
"little cherry blossoms on my nails little cherry blossom in my belly 🥟🥟🌸," Hailey wrote in her caption.

On Thursday, May 23, Justin proudly shared some new snaps of his wife’s baby bump. In the first photo of the Instagram carousel, Hailey cradled her bump in a sheer black top. She also wore a black leather jacket, blue jeans and a pair of sunglasses.
The shot was followed by a blurry version of Hailey striking the same pose, along with various other snaps of the pair enjoying their trip to Japan. “They wish baby, they wish,” Justin captioned the carousel.
Last week, Hailey was photographed leaving Billie Eilish's listening party on Thursday, May 16, at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., baring her bump as she smiled for the cameras.
Wearing a red Fila hat and a black-and-red leather racing jacket, Hailey opted for a small white tank top and low rise shorts that showed off her growing belly.
Earlier this month, Hailey confirmed she and husband Justin Bieber are expecting their first baby together, sharing the exciting news on Instagram. A rep for Hailey confirmed to PEOPLE that the model is just over six months pregnant.
Posting a video from their vow renewal, Hailey wore a long, lacy white dress and a veil, highlighting her growing bump. She also included photos of herself standing with Justin in a field. Placing his arms around her belly, Justin stood behind her, showing off their matching wedding rings.
The pregnant model kept her caption simple, just tagging her husband.
