Sunkissed, even in the winter!
If you've also been swept up with the New Year 'in and out' lists swarming socials, you'll know that once again, freckles are very much 'in' for 2024. However, this wasn't always the case. Young Gen Alpha may be blissfully unaware, but for a long time, freckles were actually considered a 'flaw'. Y'know, blemishes that needed to be concealed with full coverage makeup, if you will.
Thankfully, though, those blessed with the sun-kissed look have now been embraced, with others going as far as to pay to replicate them ‚Äì 'tis a crazy beauty world we live in, hey. And one celeb flaunting her very own natural skin complexion is Billie Eilish, who recently took to social media to show her take on the trend.
In the latest Instagram post shared to her 110 million followers, the singer is shown to be sporting a minimal no makeup, makeup look in an up-close and personal selfie. In other words, we're given a microscopic look at Bills' freckles, which you best believe we will be replicating.
Scroll to the second snap in the below carousel post to see all that we're describing:
Simply stunning, right?
To enhance her freckles, Billie has applied blush across her nose and cheeks, giving a flushed finish to the look.
Now, if you're not naturally blessed with your own, we recommend using the two following products to recreate the tanned freckled look at home. 
Dab, blend and sweep on the products and you will be good. To. Go! That, or just bare your au naturel frecks, you lucky chosen ones.
