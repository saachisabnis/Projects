Los Angeles, CA – May 21, 2024 – The Recording Academy’s Grammy Hall of Fame is undergoing a major transformation, beginning with tonight’s inaugural Grammy Hall of Fame Induction Gala at the Novo Theater at L.A. Live. 
Performers include R&B legend William Bell, who will perform his own inducted recording, “You Don’t Miss Your Water,” and Andra Day, who will honor Lauryn Hill’s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. 
Other performances include The War and Treaty’s rendition of Charley Pride’s “Kiss an Angel Good Morning,” Elle King’s take on Wanda Jackson’s “Let’s Have a Party,” and Hanson’s performance of the Doobie Brothers’ “What a Fool Believes.” 
The event will also feature interstitial video presentations for four other honorees.
This event marks the first step in a comprehensive plan to elevate the Hall of Fame’s profile and culminates in the opening of a permanent interactive exhibit at the Grammy Museum in early 2025.
Tonight’s gala is a groundbreaking event for the Grammy Hall of Fame, which had been on a one-year hiatus as the Recording Academy re-evaluated its processes and goals. 
The gala, produced by renowned television producer Ken Ehrlich alongside Chantel Sausedo and Ron Basile, with Greg Phillinganes as the musical director, is set to feature an array of tribute performances celebrating the 2024 inductees.
The Grammy Museum will debut a new annual music industry event tomorrow with its inaugural Grammy Hall of Fame Gala. 
“We’re proud to unveil the diverse mix of recordings entering the Grammy Hall Of Fame in its 50th year. The music showcased here has played a pivotal role in shaping our cultural landscape, and it’s a true honor to recognize these albums and recordings, along with the profound influence each has had on music and beyond.”
Live performances will bring William Bell, Hanson, Elle King, Andra Day, Ravyn Lenae, Shinedown, and The War and Treaty to the stage at The Novo in Los Angeles.
A related online auction is spotlighting platinum tickets to the 2025 Grammy Awards and a collection of guitars signed by artists like Taylor Swift, Joni Mitchell, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodrigo, and Billy Joel.
The gala is celebrating inducted recordings for the Grammy Hall Of Fame with all proceeds benefiting museum music education programs that make music accessible to everyone and inspire future generations of artists. 
According to the Grammy Museum, funding raised through the Campaign For Music Education doubles the number of students who enjoy access to museum galleries each year and expands educational and community programs serving more than 477,000 students.
Under the guidance of Michael Sticka, president/CEO of the Grammy Museum, and in collaboration with Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and Ruby Marchand, the Academy’s chief awards and industry officer, several key changes have been implemented in the Grammy Hall of Fame.
1. Reduced Number of Inductees: One of the most significant changes is the reduction in the number of inductees each year. Previously, 25 or more recordings were inducted annually. This year, only 10 recordings are being honored, a move intended to allow for more focused and meaningful recognition.
2. Changes in Eligibility and Selection: Another notable change is the elimination of a set number of spots for pre-1950 recordings. Now, the only requirement is that recordings must be at least 25 years old. This year’s lone pre-1950 recording, Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra’s “Ory’s Creole Trombone” (1922), was selected without the need for a reserved slot for older recordings.
3. New Honors for Record Companies: The Grammy Hall of Fame will also begin honoring record companies annually. This year, Atlantic Records, which recently celebrated its 75th anniversary, is the first label to receive this honor. 
Although no Atlantic recordings are among this year’s inductees, the label’s legacy is celebrated through performances by current Atlantic artists Shinedown and Ravyn Lenae, who will perform Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly With His Song,” respectively.
The changes don’t stop with the gala. The Grammy Museum is set to unveil a permanent interactive exhibit in early 2025, dedicated to the Grammy Hall of Fame.

This exhibit aims to celebrate the storied history of the Hall of Fame and educate visitors about the significance of these iconic recordings.
“The Hall of Fame and the Museum pretty much go hand-in-hand,” Sticka said. “When we first started talking about what this thing really could be, we talked about how the Hall of Fame should live in the Museum. It makes perfect sense.”
The interactive exhibit will feature a range of multimedia displays and educational materials, offering visitors a deep dive into the rich history of Grammy-winning music. 
The goal is not just to display the Hall of Fame inductees but to create an engaging, immersive experience that brings these historic recordings to life.
Tonight’s gala is being filmed, though it will not be televised. The Recording Academy plans to edit the footage and present it to their broadcast partners, CBS and PBS, in hopes of securing a future televised spot. 
Clips from the event will also be available on COLLECTION: live, the Grammy Museum’s streaming site.
“It’s tough to pull off a first-time event,” Sticka admitted. “There’s no proof-of-concept. [We’re] filming it so we can show what it’s going to look like and show what’s possible and hopefully somebody picks it up in the future to televise.”
The Grammy Hall of Fame was established to honor recordings of historical significance, with the first five inductions announced on the Grammy telecast in March 1974. 
Since then, 1,162 recordings have been inducted, celebrating the contributions of artists, producers, songwriters, and engineers across decades and genres.
This year’s inductees span a wide range of musical styles and eras, reflecting the diversity and richness of the Grammy Hall of Fame. 
The selected recordings highlight not only the musical achievements of their time but also their enduring impact on the cultural landscape.
