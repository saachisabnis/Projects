Billie Eilish appeared on Saturday Night Live while on tour for her latest album Hit Me Hard and Soft.
Aired just days after her back-to-back New York City tour stops at Madison Square Garden, the singer performed the songs “Birds of a Feather” and “Wildflower.”
For “Birds of a Feather,” Eilish performed in front of a blue sky screen. She was joined onstage by her brother Finneas on guitar and backup vocals. “Wildflower” saw the singer cast in dark blue light, backed only by an acoustic guitar and light drums.
The evening’s episode was hosted by Michael Keaton as he promoted his new movie Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Eilish, meanwhile, last appeared on SNL in December for a special Christmas episode.
