Ryan Gosling will also be performing.
Billie Eilish has been confirmed to perform at the 2024 Oscars ceremony.
The 96th Academy Awards will take place on March 10, and will feature performances of this year's nominated songs, which means that the ceremony will include two songs from Barbie.
Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell will perform 'What Was I Made For?', while Ryan Gosling will perform 'I'm Just Ken', with assistance from Mark Ronson.

Scott George and the Osage Singers will perform 'Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)' from Killers of the Flower Moon, Becky G will sing 'The Fire Inside' from Flamin' Hot, and Jon Batiste will perform 'It Never Went Away' from American Symphony.
This year's ceremony could see Christopher Nolan win his first ever Oscar, and his chances seem better after he won the Theatrical Feature Film award at the Directors Guild of America (DGA) Awards earlier this month. Historically, the winners of that award go on to win Best Director at the Oscars.
In fact, looking at the statistics, we've made predictions about who will win what award in six of the major Oscars categories.

Meanwhile, Barbie's Margot Robbie has responded to director Greta Gerwig not being nominated for the Best Director award.
"Obviously, I think Greta should be nominated as a director," she said. "What she did is a once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime thing. What she pulled off, it really is. But it's been an incredible year for all the films.
"We set out to do something that would shift culture, affect culture, just make some sort of impact, and it's already done that and some, way more than we ever dreamed it would. That is truly the biggest reward that could come out of all of this."
The 96th Academy Awards take place on Sunday, March 10 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. It will be broadcast on ITV in the UK.
Barbie is available to buy or rent in the UK from Prime Video, iTunes, Microsoft Store and more, as well as being available to watch on Max in the US.
