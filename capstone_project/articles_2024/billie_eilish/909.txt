Who are Billie Eilish's 'Wildflower' lyrics about? In 'Wildflower', Billie sings about feeling guilty for dating a friend's ex.
Billie Eilish fans think her song 'Wildflower' is about Devon Lee Carlson and feeling guilty for dating Jesse Rutherford.
Fans of Billie Eilish will already know that she dated The Neighbourhood star Jesse Rutherford between October 2022 and May 2023. Before the couple started dating Billie was friends with Jesse's ex, influencer Devon Lee Carlson, and the girls are still close. Just last year, Billie and Devon were photographed holding hands at Kendall Jenner's Halloween party.
Now, Billie has released a new song called 'Wildflower' and there are several easter eggs that suggest it's about Devon.
Billie Eilish - WILDFLOWER (Official Lyric Video)
In 'Wildflower', Billie sings about dating a friend's ex and feeling conflicted after she consoled her through their breakup. She sings: She was cryin’ on my shoulder / All I could do was hold her / Only made us closer until July / Now I know that you love me / You don't need to remind me / I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?.
Billie then admits that she feels guilt adding: But I see her in the back of my mind all the time / Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign / Did I cross the line?. She later sings: You say no one knows you so well / But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt / Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel.
Based on the timeline of Billie and Devon's relationships with Jesse, fans are convinced that the song is about them all. If that weren't enough, Devon has a brand of phone cases called 'Wildflower' cases.
The lyric: Cause she couldn't be / More different from me / Happy and free in leather - also appears to directly refer to Devon's style as she often wears leather.
As we've mentioned above, Billie and Devon are still friends. They actually hung out with each other as recently as Coachella 2024 so it's possible that Devon heard the song before it came out.
After Coachella, Billie shared a photo of her with Devon in a photo dump and the caption: "shoutout to love and friendship man life is beautiful." 
In other words, there's no drama here, just a great song!
