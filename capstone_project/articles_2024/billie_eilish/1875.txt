	Only 19 people have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and a Tony — the hard-to-achieve, highly coveted EGOT.

	But more than 60 performers are just one win away from joining the EGOT ranks, which includes the likes of Richard Rodgers, Rita Moreno, Audrey Hepburn and Mel Brooks.

	Cher, Kate Winslet, Common, Helen Mirren, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dick Van Dyke, Lily Tomlin and Julie Andrews are among the actors and musicians who need only one award to have an EGOT.

	Read on to see the list of performers who have won three of the four honors that make up an EGOT.

	The singer took home an Emmy in 2022 for her variety special Adele One Night Only. The trophy joined her Oscar for “Skyfall” from the 2012 James Bond film of the same name, and her 16 Grammy Awards, including two for album of the year (21 in 2012 and 25 in 2017). She only needs a Tony to complete her EGOT. 

	Anderson-Lopez’s path to near-EGOT is one structured by the success of her hit movie-turned-musical Frozen. The songwriter co-wrote music for the 2013 animated film, its 2019 sequel and the 2017 stage musical adaptation with her husband, Robert Lopez (who is himself an EGOT). As a result, she won an Oscar (“Let It Go”) and two Grammys (“Let It Go” and best compilation soundtrack) for the work. She also won a second Oscar for “Remember Me” from Coco and an Emmy for “Agatha All Along” from WandaVision. She was nominated for a Tony in 2018 for Frozen, but lost to The Band’s Visit. 
The actress needs to win a Tony Award to qualify as an EGOT recipient. She won an Oscar in 1965 for best actress as the titular role in Mary Poppins. Andrews has won three Grammy Awards. Her first was in 1965 for best recording for children for Mary Poppins. Her second was in 2011 for best spoken word album for children for Julie Andrews’ Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies. She was also honored with the lifetime achievement award at the 2011 ceremony. She won her first Emmy in 1973 in the outstanding variety musical series category for The Julie Andrews Hour and her second in 2005 for outstanding nonfiction series for Broadway: The American Musical. She was also nominated for an Emmy in 2021 for her voiceover role in Netflix’s Bridgerton, but lost to Maya Rudolph for Big Mouth. Andrews has been nominated for three Tonys, all in the best actress in a musical category. The first nomination was in 1957 for My Fair Lady. The second was in 1961 for Camelot. Her most recent Tony nomination was in 1996 for Victor/Victoria.
The composer, songwriter and producer, who died Feb. 8, 2023, was nominated for 20 Grammys and won six. His first win was in 1967 for best instrumental arrangement for “Alfie.” He won best original score written for a motion picture or a television special for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and best score from an original cast show album for Promises, Promises at the 1969 ceremony. Bacharach won song of the year for “That’s What Friends Are For” at the 1986 ceremony. He won in the best pop collaboration with vocals category in 1998 for “I Still Have That Other Girl” and in 2005 for At This Time in the best pop instrumental album category. He was also honored with the national trustees award in 1997 and with the lifetime achievement award at the 2008 ceremony. Bacharach won three Oscars. The first two were in 1970 for best original music score for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and for best original song for “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head.” His third Oscar was won in 1981 for best original song for “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do),” featured in Arthur. Bacharach won an Emmy in 1971 for outstanding single program for Singer Presents Burt Bacharach. The composer was nominated for a Tony in 1969 for his work for the musical Promises, Promises.
The singer and actor, who died April 25, 2023, at age 96, won two Grammy Awards and was nominated 11 times. His first Grammy win was for best performance in folk for Swing Dat Hammer. He then won best folk recording in 1965 for An Evening With Belafonte/Makeba. Belafonte also won two non-competitive Grammy Awards. The first was the President’s Merit Award in 1986, and the second was the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. He won a Tony in 1954 for his various roles in John Murray Anderson’s Almanac in the best featured actor in a musical category. He later won an Emmy Award in 1960 in the outstanding performance in a variety or musical program or series category for his work on The Revlon Revue. Belafonte did receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2015 Oscars, but since that’s a non-competitive award, it didn’t give him an EGOT.
The lyricists and songwriters won their first two Grammys in 1975 for best score soundtrack for visual media and for song of the year for "The Way We Were," featured in the 1973 film of the same name.
