Billie Eilish and FINNEAS trade in the live stage for the classroom in the latest episode of the YouTube series Celebrity Substitute.
In the show, the brother-sister duo visit first-graders attending Garvanza Elementary in Los Angeles to teach them how to write a song in one afternoon. After asking the students what kind of song they want to write — “Freaky!” exclaims one — they settle on the subject of a lonely polar bear.
Thus, “I’m Just a Polar Bear” is born, and Eilish and FINNEAS lead the class in a rendition of the new tune for their teacher, Ms. Fowler. 
Previous Celebrity Substitute guests include Cynthia Erivo, Camila Cabello, Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh.
