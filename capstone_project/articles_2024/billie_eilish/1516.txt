Nominations will be announced Friday for the 67th annual Grammy Awards, with newcomer Chappell Roan expected to make a big splash, along with songstress Sabrina Carpenter and Grammy veterans such as BeyoncÃ©, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish.
Roan, thanks to her album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” and her hit single “Good Luck, Babe!,” is a solid bet to land in all four of the top Grammy categories of Album, Record and Song of the Year and Best New Artist.
Carpenter also has an off chance of landing in all four categories, if her “Short n’ Sweet” release can make the cut for Album of the Year, which is expected to be a competitive category featuring likely nominees such as Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” BeyoncÃ©’s country music turn with “Cowboy Carter,” Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” and Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department.” Post Malone could also land on the list with “F-1 Trillion.”
If Eilish is nominated, it will make her three-for-three in the category, with both of her previous two albums earning nods. Her debut “Everything I Wanted” won it 2021. A nomination for BeyoncÃ© would be her fifth in the category, the most ever for a Black artist. A nod for Swift would be her seventh, giving her the most Album of the Year nominations ever for a female artist — breaking a current tie with Barbra Streisand.

BeyoncÃ© is also considered a strong candidate for Record of the Year for her hit “Texas Hold ‘Em,” along with Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!,” Carpenter’s “Espresso,” Grande’s “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” and Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather.” Other potential nominees include Kendrick Lamar for “Not Like Us” and Swift for her collaboration with Post Malone, “Fortnight.”
Many of those same hits could also score nods for Song of the Year, an honor that is presented to the songwriters, as opposed to the performer. Other possible contenders include the Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars collaboration “Die with a Smile,” and Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things.”
Boone is also expected to score a nod for Best New Artist, along with Roan, Carpenter, Shaboozey, Megan Moroney and possibly Teddy Swims. The Best New Artist award has gone to a woman for seven years in a row, tying a Grammy record.
The Grammy nominations will be announced in a 7:45 a.m. livestream led by Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr., joined by Grammy winners Brandy Clark, Kirk Franklin, David Frost, Robert Gordon, Kylie Minogue, Victoria MonÃ©t, Gaby Moreno, Deanie Parker, Ben Platt, Mark Ronson, and Hayley Williams, along with Grammy-nominated comedian Jim Gaffigan and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King.
The announcement will be streamed at live.grammy.com. The 67th Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 2 at the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
