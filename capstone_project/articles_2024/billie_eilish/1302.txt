Apple Music lit up feeds around the world today with the final dispatch from its unexpected and quietly launched “100 best albums” series, revealing the recipients of the coveted top 10 spots. While its defining criteria and intentions remain unclear, the list’s ambiguity has not mitigated the explosive discourse around it, with fans rallying for their favorites and against others. As always, best-of lists inspire a surge in attention–and clicks–and the scale and sweeping authority of Apple Music’s offering have made it rife territory for heated debate, especially concerning those highest-ranked selections.
In its assessment of all recorded music, Apple Music has awarded the highest spot to neo-soul pioneer Ms. Lauryn Hill’s massively influential 1998 entry The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. As the only solo release from legendary singer-songwriter and MC, renowned for her part in the Fugees, the landmark release features such indelible hits as “Ex-Factor,” “Doo Wop (That Thing)” and “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You,” which broke records upon its release and have continually earned it placements among greatest-of-all-time lists by Rolling Stone, the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress. Last night, the album was among those iconic releases inducted into the 50th anniversary class of the Grammy Hall of Fame. 
The top 10 is filled out by Beyoncé’s Lemonade, Nirvana’s Nevermind, Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black, Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe Edition), Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life, Frank Ocean’s Blonde, Prince & The Revolution’s Purple Rain, The Beatles’ Abbey Road and finally Michael Jackson’s Thriller at number two. This relatively tame selection has inspired less controversy than entries 20-11; the inclusion of Taylor Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) at 18 over The Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds at 20 and Adele’s 21 at 15 over Joni Mitchell’s Blue at 16 were particularly hot spots, spurring a wave of objection and counterargument–which was nearly unavoidable in this endeavor.
Relix readers will be pleased to note the inclusion of Neil Young’s After the Gold Rush, Steely Dan’s Aja, De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising, The Jimi Hendrix Experience’s Are You Experienced?, The Velvet Underground and Nico’s self-titled, The Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street (2010 Remaster), Bob Marley & The Wailers’ Exodus (2013 Remaster), Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, Led Zeppelin’s Led Zeppelin II, David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust, Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run, Bob Dylan’s Highway 61 Revisited and Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours. Jam fans will note a lack of any scene favorites, including releases from the Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers Band and Phish. Other conspicuous absences include The Band, James Brown, The Stooges, The Doors, Ray Charles, Parliament-Funkadelic, Al Green, The Byrds, Sly and the Family Stone, Otis Redding and Elvis Presley, as well as neglected genres like punk, jazz, funk, global music and the blues. In lieu, the list favors current favorites, such as Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey and Bad Bunny.
In a release, Apple attributed the list to “a team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement, fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music — a love letter to the records that have shaped the world we live and listen in.”
