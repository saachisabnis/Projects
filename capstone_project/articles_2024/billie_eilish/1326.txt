Billie Eilish released her third album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, only about two months ago. Since then, the title has performed extremely well, showing her to be the kind of superstar who can do no wrong, at least according to her huge audience. As millions continue to buy and stream her latest offering, the singer-songwriter’s sophomore project is mounting an interesting comeback.
Happier Than Ever reappears on a pair of Billboard charts this week. The title is back on both the Top Rock & Alternative Albums and Top Alternative Albums lists this frame.
Between the two, Happier Than Ever returns highest on the Top Alternative Albums chart. On that ranking, which only features 25 spaces, Eilish’s set lands at No. 22 this frame. It is one of her No. 1s on that tally.
Happier Than Ever doesn’t perform as well on the Top Rock & Alternative Albums chart. That list features twice as many spots, and it includes more subgenres in the rock space, so it’s naturally more competitive. This time around, Eilish’s second full-length reappears at No. 46.
The same studio effort is also up on one other list, the Billboard 200. On Billboard’s most important albums chart, Happier Than Ever jumps 12 spaces, though its consumption barely rises. According to Luminate, the set shifted around 8,100 equivalent units in the U.S. last week. It managed just four more units than the frame prior.
Happier Than Ever helped solidify Eilish as a proper superstar in the music industry. She released the album in the summer of 2021, and it shot right to No. 1 on most charts it reached, including the Billboard 200. The project also earned several major Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, as well as both Record and Song of the Year for the title track.
By the time Happier Than Ever dropped, Eilish was already famous and celebrated in the business. The sophomore set proved that she wasn’t a flash in the pan and that she could continue to try new things, but still score smashes and keep her massive–and growing–fan base happy (or, in her words, happier than ever).
