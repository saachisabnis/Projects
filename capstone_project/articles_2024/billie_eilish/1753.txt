KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Popstar Billie Eilish sent love to the two Kearney families involved in a wrong-way crash over the weekend, now a local business is doing the same with donations and a portion of sales to benefit them.
Three Birdies Boutique is a local business in Kearney that has been open for four years. Thursday, November 21, in-store and online, 10% of sales will go directly to the Yeates and Cunningham families, according to shop owner Stacy Linder.
Three recent Kearney grads were injured, two of the teens were killed over the weekend in the car crash and one teen is still recovering in a Nebraska hospital.

“What happened in our community is devastating and heartbreaking and while our family doesn’t personally know them, it’s an extension of our community,” said Linder.
“So if we can do a fundraiser and just help these families out just the slightest bit, we are happy to do that.”
The boutique says it is extending the tip and donation jar through next weekend, a time Linder says is the busiest weekend of the year for retail with Black Friday and Small Business Saturday sales.
The fundraiser is from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and again from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., Thursday November 21.
“If you feel it in your heart to give, give whatever you can. If you can’t, just pray for these families, because they need it,” Linder added.
You can also donate in person now until December 1 at checkout. The shop is located at 105 S Jefferson St. in Kearney.
