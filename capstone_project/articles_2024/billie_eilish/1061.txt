Some people say the Creative Arts Emmys are kinda like an appetizer to the Primetime Emmys, with some winners like Angela Bassett getting a little bit more stuffed as she gets closer to an EGOT. Hopefully you’ve got a big appetite, because this year is more of a sandwich situation — the Hollywood strikes delayed the 2023 Emmys until this January, and there’s still the 2024 Emmys next week. In between the double ceremonies were the Creative Arts Emmys, where the Television Academy will honored achievements in choreography, casting, game-show hosting, stunts, and so many other categories that the event needs to be split into two nights. The awards were presented on September 7 and 8 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. An edited version of the evenings will air on September 14 on FXX at 11 p.m. ET, before the ceremonies come to Hulu from September 15 through October 9.
If you want to be spoiled before the edited version drops on Hulu, read on! Benj Pasek and Justin Paul EGOTed with their song for Only Murders in the Building season 3, “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” Shōgun was the big winner with 14 wins out of 17. “Shōgun also landed Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, while The Bear won Casting for a Comedy and Netflix’s Baby Reindeer won Casting a Limited Series,” Joe Reid writes in his Creative Arts Emmys analysis. “Considering these are the three shows heavily favored to win their respective Outstanding Series awards, casting directors can fairly make the claim that a show’s success starts with them.” Below, the full list of 2024 Creative Arts Emmys winners.
