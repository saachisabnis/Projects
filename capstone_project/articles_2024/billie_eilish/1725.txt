The Grammys are coming up on Feb. 2, but before we find out the 2025 winners, CBS is giving viewers a look back at winners past with two Grammy specials, airing Dec. 27 and Dec. 29.
Grammy Greats: The Stories Behind the Songs focuses on past winners of the Song of the Year category. Song of the Year and Record of the Year are different because Song goes to the people who wrote the song, while Record goes to the artist, the producer and the engineer. Stars like John Mayer, Alicia Keys, Mark Ronson, Bonnie Raitt, Sting, Billie Eilish, Richard Marx, Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald are all featured on this special. It airs Friday at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
Sunday’s special is called Grammy Greats: The Most Memorable Moments, focusing on those special duets and other events that only seem to take place on the Grammy stage. Among the artists featured in this special: Dua Lipa, Elton John, Ricky Martin, Melissa Etheridge, Annie Lennox, LL Cool J, Luke Combs and Joni Mitchell. It airs at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
