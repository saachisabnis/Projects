Billie Eilish has revealed the nasty bruise she has received after she fell at her performance in Madison Square Gardens.
The 22-year-old singer’s fans were worried after footage of the singer crashing backstage made its way onto the internet. 
The singer was performing at Madison Square Garden, an iconic arena in New York, as part of her Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour. 
The performer had just finished singing to her thousands of fans when she walked down onto a lowered stage and lost her footing, crashing to the floor and bashing her thigh.
Although the footage obscured the full extent of the injury – fans were concerned after seeing the footage, even though the star managed to get back up and continue walking backstage.
The singer responded to the footage of her fall by reposting it on her Instagram story and sharing an image of a large purple bruise on her leg with the caption ‘but literally.’

A famous face joined Billie at this performance as Madonna revealed she was in the audience two of her daughters.
The Like A Prayer singer shared images of herself in the regular seating area in the concert, as she made a rather lowkey appearance at the gig – not in a VIP area.
However, the A-lister did get some special treatment as she shared images of herself meeting Billie backstage after the performance. 
Billie isn’t the only artist to injure themselves while performing and there are several times artists have been snapped tripping up on stage.
Harry Styles fully face-planted while on the One Direction On The Road Again Tour in 2015 after he unsuccessfully dragged a microphone across the stage.
In 2023, Bebe Rexha famously got injured on stage when a fan threw a phone onto the stage and it hit her in the eye.
In 2012, Lady Gaga got a black eye from a metal prop piece during a show in New Zealand. She returned to the stage at the time to tell the audience: ‘I want to apologize, I did hit my head, and I think I may have a concussion. But don’t you worry, I will finish this show.’
