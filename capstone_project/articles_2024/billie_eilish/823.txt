Lana Del Rey promised a resurrection for her headlining spot at Coachella this weekend— her billboard on the road to the festival referenced her “death” after being crucified for her Saturday Night Live performance in 2012. However, she said nothing about bringing out her disciple Billie Eilish to sing “ocean eyes” and “Video Games.” And how could she? By the time they finished harmonizing their whispers, they were stunned by each other’s presence. “Get the fuck out of my face,” joked Eilish after the performance. The two continued to gush over each other, with Del Rey raising up her protege. “Yep, that’s the voice of your generation, the voice of our generation,” she said. “I”m so fucking grateful she’s standing next to me right now singing my favorite song of hers.” Eilish replied by giving flowers (presumably, crowns) right back. “This is the reason for half of you bitches existence, including mine.” She’s not wrong. Listen to Lana Del Rey and thou shalt be saved.
