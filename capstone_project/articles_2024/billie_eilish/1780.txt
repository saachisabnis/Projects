	Just one day after declaring that Brat summer was dead (long live Brat summer), Charli XCX is already teasing something new.

	In a post on X on Instagram Tuesday (Sept. 3), Charli shared a cropped photo of two figures — one of which appears to be herself — wearing white tank tops that read “about f–king time!” Without a caption or additional comment to analyze, fans immediately took to the comments to figure out what the cryptic photo could mean.

	Amid a slew of speculation, a consensus emerged as fans speculated that the male figure in the photo was none other than Charli’s longtime friend and collaborator Troye Sivan. The Australian singer appeared to confirm those suspicions when he shared the same photo without a caption on his Instagram account. 

	Some users concluded that the post was additional marketing for the pair’s upcoming joint Sweat Tour, which kicks off in Detroit on Sept. 14, with multiple fans simply writing the words “Sweat Tour” under Charli’s photo. But a contingent of commenters guessed that the photo was a tease for something bigger — a final Brat remix featuring Sivan ahead of the pair’s tour.

	“talk talk remix with troye just in time for the sweat tour,” one fan wrote under Charli’s X post. Another agreed, pointing to fans’ speculation about who could be featured in a final Brat remix. “love how the remix rumors went up the pop ladder from lily allen to katy perry and then to taylor but its actually just troye lmfao,” they wrote. 

	The rumors around a final Brat remix (following the “Girl, So Confusing” remix with Lorde and the “Guess” remix with Billie Eilish) reached a fever pitch when Charli appeared to confirm another reimagining was on the way in an August TikTok. “maybe one more remix and then ?” the star wrote in a caption to her video.
