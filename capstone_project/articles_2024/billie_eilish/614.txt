Music Artists Asking Lawmakers For Concert Ticketing Reforms
(Washington, DC)  --  A diverse group of nearly 300 music artists is asking Congress for concert ticketing reforms.  A letter to U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chair Maria Cantwell and ranking member Ted Cruz says the current ticketing system is "broken" and "predatory resellers" are "siphoning" money from fans and performers.  The letter asks the senators to support the "Fans First Act," which would "ban fake tickets and deceptive marketing tactics."  Among the 280 signers are Graham Nash, Nile Rodgers, Aimee Mann, Billie Eilish, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz [[ muh-RAZZ ]], Dave Matthews and Cyndi Lauper.  Bands signing their names to the letter include Duran Duran, Blue Oyster Cult, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Fall Out Boy and Men At Work.
