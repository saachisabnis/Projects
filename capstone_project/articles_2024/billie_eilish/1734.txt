Ariana Greenblatt is a master prank caller with years of experience, and it shows. The Borderlands actress tricks just about everyone, from telling Billie Eilish she crashed her car on the PCH to convincing Jake Shane she’s going to be in a surprise Taylor Swift music video (poor Jake!). Watch as Greenblatt makes us all hopeful calling Eli Roth and explaining there’s a horror sequel to Barbie, and see her dad lose it when she tells him she was scammed out of $50,000 by an artist on Instagram.
