Pop star Billie Eilish shopped at a south Minneapolis vintage clothing store in a historic former White Castle on Saturday.
The singer-songwriter was in town over the weekend playing two sold-out nights at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paulon her “Hit Me Hard and Soft” tour. She stopped in at Vintage, on Lyndale Avenue near closing time, store owner Justin Schaefer said, describing her visit as a “complete surprise.”
“She seemed very into the vibe of the shop,” Schaefer said. “She was quoted as saying, ‘This place is so awesome.’”
The “Birds of a Feather,” and “What Was I Made For?” singer bought a ‘60s cooking apron with a nude female on it, which Schaefer described as “very punk.” She also bought a 1950s Coca-Cola work shirt and a black-and-white striped ‘60s referee jacket, Schaefer said. Members of her entourage also bought items.
At the store, Eilish posed for a photo with Schaefer’s 11-year-old son, whom Schaefer said “played it cool.”
“My son was the most excited, which is the best,” he said.
Schaefer wondered how Eilish found his shop, which he said carries niche items.
“I don’t really know how she found it, probably like anybody else,” he said. “People are always curious what’s in this 1930s White Castle on the National Register of Historic Places.”
