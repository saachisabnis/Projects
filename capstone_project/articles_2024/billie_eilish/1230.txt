Some people wereÂ doing some adult activities in the Allegan State Game Area and left the receipts. Some folks are not happy while others have lots of fun things to say.
I'm not sure when John Denver wrote the song "Take Me Home, Country Roads" that he meant for everyone to feel way at home on those country roads and leave their naughty trash behind.
I remember back in the day looking for an unsuspecting farm field or state park boat landing or road to do a little sparking with my significant other but the cardinal rule was always leave the space the way you found it.
Some people like to take a step further than the vehicle and get out into the wild but don't leave your receipts behind like someone did at Allegan State Game Area.
I have never purchased a bra before but from the ladies that I talk to, they can be very expensive so not sure why someone would leave one behind but they did so at the Allegan State Game area over the weekend.
Kora Lynn Sweet made a post on the Allegan County Informed Facebook page and I thought in her post above she worded it like a champion by saying "I don't care what you're doing or where you're doing it really, but if you're going to be doing *ahem* adult things, you should be behaving like an adult and cleaning up after yourself."
As you can see above, the internet has had some fun with Kora's initial post like Chad catching them on his trail cam. Ryan had a funny note about a "Couple chipmunks could have made a hammock outa that" bra that was found.
Jena Lewis posted a great comment which said "All I have to say is...hope y'all checked for ticks. If it is warm enough for spicy time, it is warm enough for ticks. If you want to see more of these comments or would like to join in with a few click here.
