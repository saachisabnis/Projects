If you have your finger on the pulse of it-girl-certified fashion brands, you’ll recognize South Korean eyewear brand Gentle Monster just by the silver accents on the sides of all its glasses and sunglasses. A-listers like Billie Eilish, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, and Gigi Hadid have been spotted in pairs, while Yoon Se-ri from Crash Landing on You wore the brand’s frames in the popular K-drama. But what really launched Gentle Monster into eyewear stardom was its collaboration with BLACKPINK’s Jennie Kim in April 2024. What you might not know, however, is that although fashion girlies near and far flock to its stores and online site, the brand doesn’t host sales.

Just because the brand itself never slashes the prices of its frames doesn’t mean you can’t find discounted Gentle Monster anywhere. There are numerous Gentle Monster Black Friday deals available right this second. The major retailer that’s giving the people what they want? Farfetch!
I was surprised to discover that Farfetch (its Black Friday sale already started and runs through December 2) carries around 50 pairs of on-sale glasses and sunglasses from the eyewear brand. Markdowns range from 15% to 25%, which is a godsend considering the cheapest pair of Gentle Monsters costs $245 on its site. Usually, though, you can expect to pay upwards of $300 for any given pair of glasses or sunnies (peep our story on Gentle Monster alternatives).
While I know you might be struggling to stomach the idea of spending $300 on a single pair of frames, I have two Gentle Monster sunglass styles and can confirm that they’re the real deal. The fit is unparalleled for folks with smaller faces and noses, and the aesthetic is edgy, sporty, nostalgic, sleek, spunky, distinct, all of the above. TBH, I feel like an alter ego takes over me whenever I slide my GM sunnies onto my face, like I just unlocked an air of cool-girl confidence.
That’s the power of the brand’s trendy eyewear, and if you want to channel your own GM alter ego, I suggest you keep reading to scoop up Farfetch’s Gentle Monster Black Friday deals.

 









Sadly, Gentle Monster does not host an official Black Friday sale on its site. However, all hope is not lost because you can buy Gentle Monster sunglasses and glasses on sale at Farfetch as we speak.
