	The Grammy Awards will return to Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Alongside the official date for the 2025 ceremony, the Recording Academy has also revealed the schedule for when nominations will be announced in the lead-up to music’s biggest night.

	The eligibility period for the 2025 Grammy Awards began on Sept. 16, 2023, and will conclude on Aug. 30, 2024. Nominations for selected works and artists will be revealed on Nov. 8, 2024.

	This would include the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft, Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department, Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine, Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism, and more blockbuster pop releases. 

	The Recording Academy will host its first round voting period from Oct. 4, 2024, through Oct. 15, 2024. Following the nominations ceremony, the final voting round will occur between Dec. 12, 2024, and Jan. 3, 2025.

	So far, no substantial changes have been made to the structural body of the Grammy Awards for 2025. In 2023, ahead of the 2024 Grammy Awards season, the Recording Academy made adjustments to the Big Four categories — Album, Record, and Song of the Year as well as Best New Artist — to reduce the number of potential nominees from 10 to eight. It also grappled with the rise of AI technology in music and debuted three new categories: Best African Music Performance, Best Pop Dance Recording, and Best Alternative Jazz Album.
