The MTV Video Music Awards took place last night at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York.
During the red carpet, there was an incident where Chappell Roan hit back at a photographer who told her to "shut the fuck up". Turning around after fixing her outfit, she said: "No, you shut the fuck up. Don't! Not me, bitch."
Sharing his support for Chappell Roan, Noah Kahan posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: "I’ll never forget leaving Clive Davis and the horrific shit photographers and paparazzi or whatever were saying to me in front of my sweet mom who couldn’t believe it was actually happening. Love this @ChappellRoan way to stand up for yourself"

Despite her struggles on the red carpet, Chappell Roan took home the award for Best New Artist, following in the footsteps of Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, and last year's winner Ice Spice. The other nominees in the category were Gracie Abrams, Tyla, Benson Boone, Shaboozey, and Teddy Swims.
Chappell Roan dedicated her award to the queer community: “I dedicate this to all the drag artists who inspire me, and I dedicate this to queer and trans people who fuel pop. To the gays who dedicate my songs to someone they love or hate. And thank you to the people who are fans, who listen to me, who hear me when I share my joy and fears...And for all the queer kids in the Midwest watching right now, I see you. I understand you, because I’m one of you. And don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t be exactly who you want to be, bitch.”
