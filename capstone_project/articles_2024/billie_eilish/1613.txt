           “Michael said the nicest things in my audition, but as soon as Gwen turned around I kind of blacked out a little bit,” Simon tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “She’s just so gracious and has been amazing to work with.”


           In the Battles round, Simon went up against 15-year-old Sydney Sterlace. Sterlace was ultimately crowned the winner after both performed the song “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eilish.   


           Simon did not head home though — for those unfamiliar with the show, The Voice allows coaches two steals each, meaning they can take an artist for their team and keep them on for the next round.   


           After Bublé and fellow coaches Reba McEntire and Snoop Dogg pressed their steal buttons nearly simultaneously, Simon ultimately chose Bublé’s team.

  “I’m really excited about Michael,” Simon says. “I think he was the first coach to really hear something in my voice and he’s been so kind.”
Simon says preparing for The Voice was a long process, starting with filming her audition over the summer.

   “They made me feel like a star,” she says of The Voice team. “They help with wardrobe, do your hair and makeup, help with staging and band rehearsals, and made me feel as prepared as possible to step on that stage.”
  For her blind audition, Simon sang Natasha Bedingfield’s “Unwritten,” and dedicated it to her dad, who recently passed away from metastatic melanoma.




      “My dad actually encouraged me to audition for the show, and it’s very special that I got to do this, and he got to be a part of it,” she says. “I’m sad he wasn’t able to see the airing of the show, but I know he’s watching.”
    




    Simon says being on The Voice has been “great distraction” for her family, especially since she has also dealt with her mother being diagnosed with cancer when Simon was just eight years old.



    “It’s been so crazy to see everything on TV,” she says. “To be honest with you, it feels like it only airs in my house, like I feel like my mom is just pulling up a bunch of videos of me performing for people in my living room to see.”

           While Simon cut her teeth on No Doubt songs, perhaps ending up on Team Bublé was where Simon was meant to be after all.
