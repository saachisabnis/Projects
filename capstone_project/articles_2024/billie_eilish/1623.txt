The Screen Actors Guild Awards (SAG) exclusively honors actors and their accomplishments. 
Shortly after the SAG Awards come the Academy Awards. Since there are film categories at the SAG Awards, there is typically a lot of overlap in terms of nominations between the two ceremonies. 
Read on to learn more about the SAG Awards, and this year's nominees.

WHO HAS THE MOST OSCARS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS? 
The SAG Awards will be streaming live on Netflix. The ceremony will be held at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall on Saturday, Feb. 24 at 8 p.m. ET. 
The pre-show featuring guest arrivals and interviews will stream on Netflix, as well as YouTube and TikTok. 
For the past few years, the SAG Awards have not had a host. Instead, presenters and winners fill up the allotted time for the show. 
This year, presenters include Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Chastain, Billie Eilish, Glen Powell and Melissa McCarthy.

The SAG Awards pre-show will be hosted by Tan France from the Netflix series "Queer Eye" and Elaine Welteroth, editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue.
SAG Award nominees and winners are chosen by a group of SAG members. 
There are two different committees, one designated for motion pictures and the other for TV. 
The members are randomly selected every year and are each made up of 2,500 individuals, according to SAG's website. 
Currently, there are 160,000 individuals who are a part of SAG, according to their website. 
The 160,000 members include announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers and editors, hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists, and representatives from other parts of the media.
