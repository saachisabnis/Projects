Sleep Token have been opening for Bring Me The Horizon on their current Australian tour
Bring Me The Horizon brought out IV from Sleep Token to perform ‘Antivist’ during a show in Brisbane today (April 20).
The Sheffield metallers have been on tour in Australia with Sleep Token as main support, as well as Make Them Suffer and Daine.
During the show, the masked band’s guitarist joined Bring Me The Horizon for a special rendition of the 2013 hit where he got to take a more prominent role vocally. Although he isn’t Sleep Token’s main vocalist, he also provides additional screams.
Amusingly, it appears that frontman Oli Sykes performed the track wearing one of Sleep Token’s old masks, which IV himself was also wearing. Sleep Token unveiled new masks at their Wembley Arena show in December.
Check out fan-filmed footage of their performance of ‘Antivist’ below:

On the UK leg of Bring Me The Horizon’s ‘POST HUMAN: NeX GEn’ tour in January, they were joined by Noah Sebastian, the frontman of their support act Bad Omens, for ‘Antivist’. Meanwhile, for the Liverpool date and the second of two nights in London, Olli Appleyard of Static Dress – who were also opening for Bring Me The Horizon – guested on ‘Diamonds Aren’t Forever’. 
In a four-star review of the tour’s opening night in Cardiff, NME described the show as “a blistering comeback statement” that proved BMTH were “still at their best”.
The band’s guitarist Lee Malia has been absent for the duration of the tour as he is “taking some time out with the new addition to his family”.
In February, BMTH won the Best Alternative/Rock Act award at the BRITs 2024. Speaking to NME at the ceremony, the group gave an update on when fans could expect their delayed next album, ‘POST HUMAN: NeX GEn’.
“It’s nearly finished, but it’s not finished,” explained frontman Oli Sykes.
“Every time we think we’ve got it, we get another song. It’s going to be right good though, it’s our best album ever… Worth the wait.”
However, earlier this month, it appeared the release date was coming closer, when the band posted a clip confirming that “it’s time for a new era”. There has been speculation over potential collaborations with Underoath and Billie Eilish on ‘POST HUMAN: NeX GEn’.
