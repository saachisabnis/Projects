Billie Eilish made it a point to not share singles off her new album Hit Me Hard and Soft before its release, but fans can hear a preview of one of the tracks, "Birds of a Feather," thanks to Netflix. The streaming service used the song to soundtrack a teaser trailer for the third season of its show Heartstopper.
The previewed portion of the song features bright guitar and drums with Eilish declaring "I’ll love you till the day I die / Till the day that I die.” Her vocal delivery is strong and full-throttle, which is quite different than the soft tone she's used in the past.
Listen to "Birds of a Feather" in the Heartstopper trailer below.
Hit Me Hard and Soft is slated to come out on Friday (May 17); however, select fans will have a chance to hear the album early at listening parties. Last month, EIlish explained her decision not to release singles to promote the album. “Every single time an artist I love puts out a single without the context of the album, I’m just already prone to hating on it," she said. "I really don’t like when things are out of context. This album is like a family: I don’t want one little kid to be in the middle of the room alone.”
She plans to head out on an extensive world tour in support of the album that kicks off this fall and goes until July 2025. You can see the full list of tour dates here.
