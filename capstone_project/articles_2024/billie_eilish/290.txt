	A series of billboards apparently teasing Billie Eilish’s new album have popped up in major cities across the world, as noted in multiple social media posts on Tuesday. The billboards do not feature the Grammy- and Oscar-winning artist’s name but do include her familiar “blohsh” symbol and what appear to be lyric snippets saying things like “Did I cross the line?,” “I try to live in black and white” and “She’s the headlights I’m the deer.” A rep for the artist did not immediately respond to Variety‘s requests for comment.

	The billboards feature a shade of blue that is now the profile photo and backdrop of her social media accounts. Their locations were unclear at the time of this article’s publication but at least two appear to be in New York and Eilish’s hometown of Los Angeles.

	Eilish’s team used a similar tactic in 2021 to tease the release of her second full-length, “Happily Ever After.”

	While Eilish and her brother/musical collaborator Finneas spent most of the last few months on an exhaustive awards campaign promoting “What Was I Made For?,” their song from the blockbuster “Barbie” film and soundtrack – ultimately a successful one, as they won both Grammys and an Oscar for it – they have not released a new album since “Happily Ever After” in July of 2021, although they have toured and released other material.

	Eilish confirmed late in February that her new album has been mastered, which is the usually last step before an album is manufactured and sent to streaming services.

	She and Finneas have said that writing “What Was I Made For?” opened up the floodgates after a logjam they’d been experiencing in coming up with material for Eilish’s third full album.

	 “There is a whole album of music coming,” Eilish said in September. “We’re in the final stages of making it, so that doesn’t mean it’s about to come out, but it is getting there and it’s very exciting.”
