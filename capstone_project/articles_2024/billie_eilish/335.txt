McDonald’s is striving for sweet nostalgia in its latest McFlurry.
It’s called Grandma McFlurry, and according to Restaurant Business Online it taps into a Gen Z trend called grandmacore.
Grandmacore, however, is more about fashion than food, as in knitwear and other garments that aren’t too practical as summer arrives. Teen Vogue holds up Billie Eilish wrapping scarves around her head as an example.
The fast food giant describes the dessert as vanilla soft serve blended with a “smooth, sweet syrup,” but on a trip to McDonald’s to taste it staff members called it butterscotch.
It’s topped with pieces of hard candy that a news release said is like the kind grandmothers’ hid in their purses.
The Grandma McFlurry is priced around $5 and will be available for a limited time.
