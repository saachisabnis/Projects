Billie Eilish's tour is totally sold out! Unless you want to pay insane amounts of money to get re-sale tickets. But don't worry, if you're a Billie fan who wants to see her when she comes to Minnesota, you've come to the right place!
Billie has hit the road already for her big tour after releasing her new album 'Hit Me Hard and Soft' in May.
Tickets sold out relatively quickly. Yes, the Minnesota shows are sold out now too. But if you want to get your hands on tickets, all you have to do is listen to 106.9 KROC.
Billie will take the stage in Minnesota at the Xcel Energy Center on November 10th and 11th.
Here's how you can win your way into the show:
Starting on Monday, October 14th, listen to 106.9 KROC for back-to-back Billie Eilish songs. After the second song plays we will give you a code. Make sure you write it down so you don't forget!
From there, open the 106.9 KROC app and tap the 'Billie Tix' button. That will bring you back here where you'll enter the code below.
Back-to-back Billie could happen at any time! Also, hot tip, having the notifications turned on on our app might be very beneficial. Just saying.
I bet she's going to put on a great show, so you won't want to miss it. Get your oversized outfit ready and good luck!
