Billie Eilish will no longer be revealing details about her sexuality. 
The "BIRDS OF A FEATHER" star recently sat down with Vogue as part of the magazine's November cover story, candidly speaking on a few things she wished she'd kept to herself amid an ever-evolving rise to stardom, including her dating life. 
"I wish no one knew anything about my sexuality or anything about my dating life. Ever, ever, ever. And I hope that they never will again. And I’m never talking about my sexuality ever again. And I’m never talking about who I’m dating ever again."
The songstress has been romantically linked to a few musicians in the last couple of years, but has remained firm on the opinion that who she dates has never been anyone's business but her own, telling Elle in 2021:  
"Like, oh yeah, that’s everyone else's business, right? No. Where's that energy with men? I just wanted to make a song once, and then I kept making songs."
Last year, during an interview for Variety's Power of Women issue, Eilish unveiled that she was intimidated by women, specifically  "their beauty and their presence." The internet was quick to react to her coming out; a series of events the "Ocean Eyes" standout referred to as being "blown up into the biggest news of the whole world."
According to People, the star did not intend to come out when she did, but thought her fans already knew that she was interested in women stating: "I kind of thought, 'Wasn’t it obvious?'"
Eilish continues to give herself grace as she grows through both the beauty of life, and the never-ending trials and tribulations attached to fame. 
"We're all babies. We’re all little kids growing up and learning ourselves."
Listen to Eilish's third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, (released last summer) on iHeartRadio now.
