Searching for a new signature scent that smells expensive but isn’t? Target has the answer (surprise, surprise).
Back in January, the retailer launched an exclusive fragrance collection called Fine’ry Perfume, and it wasn’t long before the line of Eau de Parfums (starting at around $30 each) went viral on TikTok. Available both online and in-store (though good luck finding them on shelves), Fine’ry consists of over a dozen scents and, according to TikTokers, each one smells like a designer dupe. What’s more? You can also find each fragrance in a body mist form for a more lightweight spritz.
