Jon Kahn’s new song ‘Fighter,’ which took the number #1 spot on the iTunes charts across all genres late Wednesday, got another big boost from former President Donald Trump on Friday.
‘Fighter’ pays tribute to the adversity Trump has faced while trying to recapture the White House.
“This is now the Number One song, across all charts, about me. Such an unexpected honor!” Trump said on TRUTH Social along with a video of the song.
Breitbart’s Jon Kahn sat down at his piano recently and asked himself one question: What kind of man could withstand the relentless barrage of attacks that have been leveled at former President Donald Trump?
The answer: a fighter.
Kahn told Breitbart News: “I’ve always wondered how Trump gets out of bed every day given everything that’s been thrown at him and his family: two impeachments, de-platforming from social media, the entire democrat media complex fighting in concert to destroy him, unprecedented lawfare, and now two assassination attempts.”
And so, the origins of ‘Fighter’ were born.
‘Fighter’ is now sitting atop songs from the music industry’s biggest stars, like Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Luke Combs, and Jelly Roll.
