Megan Fox has got the April blues. 
The “Transformers” star, 37, teased a style switch-up on Instagram Sunday as she bid farewell to her pink hair, and she delivered on the promise by posting a new pic of herself with baby blue locks — and a much shorter cut — Tuesday afternoon.
“entering my jedi era” she captioned a series of photos of herself with a blunt bob cut and light blue hair as she rocked a black crop top ($45) from celeb-loved brand Namilia. 
Fox — who previously wore her hair several inches below her shoulders — struck a variety of poses in the carousel of pics as she showed off her shorter ‘do and frosty blue color by L’Oreal Paris ($10), accenting her blue eyes with shimmery pink shadow.
Fans were into the fresh look for spring, like one who wrote, “i saw megan fox dyed her hair blue so i dyed my hair blue.”
“Ooo matches your eyes 👏🔥” another Instagram user added, while Fox’s makeup artist, Jenna Kristina, wrote, “👽🛸👽🛸 you’re out of this world!!”

Fox prepared her millions of Instagram followers for the change on Easter, writing, “in memoriam of my pink hair era february 2024-april 2024” and sharing a carousel of photos showing off her Barbiecore locks.
The “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” star made the switch to pink in February after sporting majorly bright red hair from November through January — and Fox seems to be following in Billie Eilish’s colorful footsteps by changing up her strands on the regular. 
Hair dye aside, the movie star got real about plastic surgery on an episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast last week, sharing that she’s had breast implants and a nose job over the years.
Although she doesn’t have enough fat to get a Brazilian butt lift, Fox joked that if she could, the results would be extremely noticeable. 
“I’m going to walk through a park and I’m going to turn around and everyone is going to be whispering and laughing and talking,” she told the podcast. “Like a circus freak.”
While she might not have a BBL, at least her hair will get people talking.
