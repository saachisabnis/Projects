	Sabrina’s infectious hit “Taste” (Island) holds strong at No. 1 for its eighth week, maintaining its grip on the chart. But Charli’s “Sympathy Is a Knife” (Atlantic) coming in as hot as a brat summer, surging to No. 2 after a remix featuring Ariana Grande gave it a major boost. With only 1,000 chart units separating the two, the competition is fierce, and Charli is well-positioned for a possible takeover.

	Gracie Abrams continues her rise as well, with “I Love You, I’m Sorry” (Interscope) poised to vault eight spots to claim No. 3, which would mar her first-ever U.K. Top 3 single. The song’s emotional depth and strong streaming performance have propelled her into new chart territory.

	BLACKPINK’s JENNIE is making a mark with her latest solo single “Mantra” (Columbia), which is poised to enter the U.K. Top 20 at No. 18, potentially marking her first major solo chart breakthrough in the region.
