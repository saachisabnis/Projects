Billie Eilish is less than a week out from the release of her third studio album, Hit Me Hard And Soft. The project was announced last month and will mark her first full-length release since 2021’s Happier Than Ever.
In the lead-up to the LP’s premiere, the singer has announced a global tour and two Hit Me Hard And Soft listening events, which will take place in New York and Los Angeles this week.
Eilish has now previewed a snippet of the album cut “Birds of a Feather.” The song appears in the trailer for season three of Netflix’s teen rom-com Heartstopper.
“I’ll love you till the day I die,” Eilish croons in the audio.
