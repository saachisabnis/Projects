Fortnite is constantly putting out new collaborations – as of late, the game has teamed up with Billie Eilish, LEGO and Family Guy.
The latest name to join the Fortnite family will be the post-apocalyptic video game – now also known as a Prime Video series – Fallout. Based on the long-running franchise of the same name, Fallout premiered on the streamer last month and was an instant hit. The show has already been renewed for a second season.
Fortnite teased the collaboration with a photo on X of the Brotherhood of Steel’s T-60 power armor, a single-operator suit that was developed by the US government. The post doesn’t offer any additional information and is merely captioned with a wink and thumbs-up emojis – a nod to Vault Boy’s pose, the mascot that represents the fallout shelter corporation Vault-Tec.

Releasing on May 24, the forthcoming Fortnite season is called “Wrecked.” Given the Fallout partnership, fans can likely expect some sort of ruined wasteland to explore.
