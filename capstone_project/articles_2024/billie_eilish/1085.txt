Before a sold-out crowd at Denver’s Ball Arena, pop sensation Billie Eilish made a unique request: she wanted to spend time with some animals. Two Colorado animal shelters, Brighter Days Dog Rescue and Broken Shovels Farm Sanctuary, stepped up to make it happen.Becca Orin, founder and director of Brighter Days, shared that her organization worked with Broken Shovels to organize a heartwarming backstage visit. Puppies, kittens, and even Samson the Pony joined Eilish, her mom, and her team for some much-needed animal therapy. Samson, in particular, soaked up the attention and enjoyed plenty of treats.Eilish’s love for animals shone through in photos shared by Brighter Days on social media. In the images, the singer is all smiles as she cuddles a puppy and shares a sweet moment with Samson.“This isn’t the first time we’ve brought animals to Ball Arena for performers,” Orin noted, “but Billie was the first artist who allowed us to take photos and share them online. That generosity means a lot.”Please sign this petition to Help Send Escaped Lab Monkeys to a Sanctuary!Being publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high-quality content.Click here to Support UsRelated Content:
