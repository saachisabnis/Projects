During an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday (November 7), Rihanna sang the praises of Billie Eilish. The Fenty Beauty mogul even seemed surprised that the Grammy and Oscar winning musician has even heard of her. “Billie Eilish, she knows me?” Rihanna said modestly, before explaining just why she loves her music. “She is the most Anti, coolest girl ever. In my mind, she doesn’t listen to commercial music, or anyone’s music,” Rihanna shared. “She’s creating her diary… vocally. You can feel that she’s zoned into who she is and what she’s experienced, and what she’s feeling, even if she doesn’t know what it is.” Rihanna went on to declare that she believed Eilish deserved a bunch of Grammys when they were announced the following day. RiRi’s prophecy came true when Billie received seven total nominations for the 2025 Grammy Awards, including Album, Song, and Record of the Year nods. (Rolling Stone)
