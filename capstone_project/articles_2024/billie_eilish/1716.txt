Justice never sleeps.

Last week we trepidatiously predicted Justice’s Hyperdrama to emerge as our overall, number one album of the year when 2024 is all said and done. After another week of double digit spins, that prediction seems less worthy of caution and more like a foregone conclusion. Time will still tell, of course, but we’re finding it tough to imagine anything making a bigger splash. Pro tip: Do yourself a favor and carve out some time to listen to Hyperdrama start to finish. The art of the album is alive and well in the French duo’s (hyper)talented hands.
