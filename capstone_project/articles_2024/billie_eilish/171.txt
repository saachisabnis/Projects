Billie Eilish announced plans for “Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour” on Monday, with three nights scheduled for the Kia Forum in Inglewood from Dec. 15-17.
The 22-year-old Los Angeles native, who earlier this month performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival as a guest on two songs with headliner Lana Del Rey, will release her third album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” on May 17.
While at Coachella, Eilish also showed up for a surprise DJ set at the Do Lab, where she gave a packed crowd a sneak preview of one or or two tracks from the album.
“Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour” kicks off in Quebec, Canada on Sept. 29 and works its way across North America before wrapping up its first leg with the Forum shows in December. It resumes in February in Australia, before jumping to Europe in April where Eilish will tour through July 2024.
The American Express presale and artist presale for the tour begin at 12 p.m. Pacific on Tuesday, April 30, with general ticket sales opening at 12 p.m. Pacific on Friday, May 3.
Eilish’s tour will also try to limit or eliminate the ability of scalpers to resell tickets for more than face value. It will use Ticketmaster’s Face Value Exchange, which allows fans with tickets they cannot use to resell them for face value. As part of that program, all tickets will be mobile only and will not be eligible to transfer to someone else.
