Cooler temps around Colorado usually signal not just fall in Colorado, but it's also the beginning of spooky season as well. This is Colorado's best and most popular fall festival and haunted attraction year after year.
Colorado temps are dropping, leaves are changing and falling to the ground and pumpkin spice mania is running wild. If you're not into any of those things, how about the fact that Halloween is this month?
If you're looking for something fun to do with the family, or maybe a fun date night, you can accomplish both at one of the season's best fall festivals and haunted attractions in Colorado.
Erie, Colorado is home to one of the state's biggest fall attractions, Anderson Farms. From its massive pumpkin patch, 25-acre corn maze, and so much more, their Fall Festival is a can't-miss for family fun this season.
If you're looking for more of a date night or grown-up get-together, Anderson Farms is home to the very best haunted attraction in the state. Some would argue, including me, that it may be one of the best in the world. Terror In The Corn is unlike anything you've ever experienced...
There's a reason why Terror In The Corn has been voted one of the very best haunted attractions in the nation year after year. It's ever-changing and somehow finds ways to get better and better each and every season.
Help us kick off the spooky season and experience Anderson Farms for yourself this FridayÂ night, as Big Rob from Townsquare Media's 99.9 The Point broadcasts live from 5-7 pm.
While live on-site, we'll be signing up for tickets to go see Billie Eilish at the Ball Arena this November, as well as other sweet prizes, so make sure to stop by our tent by the front entrance to say hello and get hooked up!
