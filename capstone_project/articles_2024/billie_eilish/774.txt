With Monday’s episode of The Voice, NBC‘s never-ending sing-off went live for the first time in Season 25. But did all 12 of the contestants really come alive? Read on, and we’ll discuss which members of Teams John Legend, Reba McEntire, Chance the Rapper and Dan + Shay gave the kind of performances that were likeliest to get them voted through to the Semi-Finals.
Bryan Olesen (Team Legend), “Don’t Stop Me Now” — Grade: C+ | The season’s eldest contestant, 50-year-old Bryan knew that he had to bring his all to the stage to conquer Queen’s classic. And did he? Mm, I imagine so. But for my money, his all wasn’t enough. He ran around and went as far over the top as he could, but neither his vocal nor his presence could hold a candle to the late, great Freddie Mercury’s. I just don’t see (or hear) the reason for the hype.

Tae Lewis (Team Dan + Shay), “19 You + Me” — Grade: B- | Boldly tackling his coaches’ first hit, Tae wowed the duo in rehearsal but got a little pitchy toward the end (even they said so). When it really counted, Tae delivered an imperfect but spirited performance. Would I have switched it off if it had come on the radio? No. But would I have wanted his album? Also, no. Dan + Shay, predictably, loved it to bits.
Maddi Jane (Team Chance), “Happier Than Ever” — Grade: B | Turning Billie Eilish’s hit into a song about her own experiences in showbiz, Maddi — with sly coaching from Chance — unleashed a well-modulated performance that built in intensity… and yet, still didn’t necessarily show her off as well as we might have hoped. Not sure that this was the “moment” that she needed at this stage of the competition.
L. Rodgers (Team Reba), “Up to the Mountain” — Grade: C | Man, I wanted to love L.’s Patty Griffin cover. Really, I did. She was clearly feeling it. But she whiffed as many notes as she hit. Was it powerful? Impassioned? Yes and also yes. But was it really, you know, good? Eh. Sad to say, I don’t think so. Of course, Reba insisted that L. had “nailed it.” Cut to: Reba shocked that L. is singing for the Wildcard Instant Save Tuesday.
Madison Curbelo (Team Dan + Shay), “Yesterday” — Grade: A- | The Beatles classic? Solid song selection for Madison, who said that she had her supportive brothers in mind when performing it. On stage, she turned out an absolutely lovely and poised rendition of the oldie. And I tell ya what? Her vocal was so pretty, it kept me from obsessing about the puffy sleeves that looked like she was popping popcorn in them.

 





Asher HaVon (Team Reba), “I’ll Make Love to You” — Grade: A | I sensed that Asher might be in trouble when in rehearsal, he was already wondering how to sell a song that didn’t reflect his own story. But nope, there was no reason to worry. Asher pulled it out in a big way when the spotlight fell on him. His decadently rich tone and enviable range 100-percent sold his version of Boyz II Men’s ballad. Final Five or bust!
Zoe Levert (Team Legend), “Stick Season” — Grade: C+ | I may never be the president of Zoe’s fan club, but the newlywed did a pretty good job of navigating the rapid-fire lyrics of Noah Kahan’s hit. There just wasn’t anything in her performance — not a vocal, not a gesture, not a moment — that made me say, “Yep, she’s a star.” Regardless of what the coaches exclaimed, this was pleasant but altogether forgettable.
Karen Waldrup (Team Dan + Shay), “I Hope You Dance” — Grade: A- | On Lee Ann Womack’s ballad, Karen’s years of experience playing clubs really shone. There was no hesitancy, no uncertainty, not even a hint of “Gee, can I hit this note?” nerves. The country crooner just got up there and sang the hell out of it. For sure, one of Monday’s most polished performances.
Serenity Arce (Team Chance), “Traitor” — Grade: C | In rehearsal, the 17-year-old said that she wanted to convey vulnerability on Olivia Rodrigo’s ballad. And that, she did. But where she fell short — way short — was in conveying the anger of the song without losing pitch and just sounding like she was yelling at us. I expected more. Even Chance’s post-performance praise felt unusually reserved.

 





Nadège (Team Chance), “He Loves Me” — Grade: B- | Wow, what a perfect song for Nadège. Newly engaged, she was able to completely inhabit Jill Scott’s ballad and even give us a bit more energy than she usually does. Unfortunately, when push comes to shove, she just doesn’t pack the kind of vocal punch that is going to earn her the win (or, unless I’m mistaken, get her through to the Semi-Finals). Enjoyable but not enough.
Josh Sanders (Team Reba), “Angels (Don’t Always Have Wings)” — Grade: A- | Credit where it’s due: On Thomas Rhett’s ballad, Josh gave us a vocal that was as a solid as the broad side of a barn. Nuanced, well-calibrated, powerful. Not sure what else a country fan could ask for. “That touched my heart so much,” Reba sobbed. (But honestly, at this point, I’m pretty sure you could make Reba weep doing Sisqó’s “Thong Song.”)
Nathan Chester (Team Legend), “Higher and Higher” — Grade: A+ | On Jackie Wilson’s classic, Nathan served up an undeniable reminder of why he’s a frontrunner for the win. The guy just has it: charisma to spare, an out-of-this-world voice and a stunning ability to make the most of every tool in his toolbox. His vocal didn’t even falter as he worked the crowd. Couldn’t have loved this more.

Bryan always delivers.
I think the final five should be:
Nathan
Bryan
Madison
Josh
Maddi Jane
A coup;e realy hit the mark tonight but when Chester started I was up and going with the music.  He rocked the song!!!
He’s very talented, and VERY likeable, yet most of his performances have a cruise ship flavor. What album would he make? A Motown Review? I am hoping for a winner with a fresher approach.
Zoe Levert has been the most amazing contestant. She has exhibited more growth than any of the others. Her version of Iris was worthy of Hollywood! But her choice of song did not give her the opportunity to perform vocally or emotionally. Although she did it well.
I don’t get what’s so special about Bryan. He sounds like a working wedding singer.
Nothing wrong with folks who do that for a living, but it’s a step below what many of the other singers (including some who didn’t make it this far) brought this season.
Asher!!!
From best to worst:
Nathan
Josh
Asher
Karen
Madison
Maddi Jane
L
Tae
Bryan
Serenity
Zoe
Nadege
I hate that we can only vote for one singer!
I hate that 2/3 of the country can’t participate in the “instant save.”
Nathan and Madison stood out to me.  Not a country fan but Karen and Josh did well, also.  Disappointed in L and Bryan, they just didn’t bring it, like they were trying too hard?   The rest are kind a blur and in between.  Too many nice pleasant female performances that will cancel each other out.
Madison, Nathan, & Maddie Jane topped evening for me.
.
I wasn’t feelin it for Reba’s Team tonight, altho I’d put all three as 2nd tier with Karen, Zoe, & Nadege.
.
Those 6 plus 3 at top, makes 9. One of the 6 go to Instant Save with Bryan, Serenity, & Tae (if I have bottom 3 right). I’d guess Nadege or L. might be the unfortunate 4th.
Guess my hearing was totally different to you Charlie and others. I thought Chance’s trio nailed it. And yes, Nathan was fantastic. Karen brought it too. Pdsizzle I agree with you about  Bryan. Disappointed in Zoe tonight. I think L. Rodgers, Tae, Bryan and Zoe will be bottom four.
Tae’s hat is disturbing on him. It’s disproportionate to his body. HE NEEDS A REAL COWBOY HAT!
I think it every time I see him. Anyone?
I guess the nerves kicked in for some of these very talented performers. But we know for those off their game, what they can do. With this being said I was going crazy, that I could only vote for one person.
Nathan was off the charts he was incredible. This also includes Madison, Karen and Josh.The rest held their own ………Brian, Zoe, Maddi, we’re good but I missed that special edge they have in their performances, that forces you to want to listen. Asher was great and I thought serenity held her own. I enjoyed her performance.
I at work and I’m sure I’m missing other things I wanna say, but I hope for those who I mention will at least stand out and stay in the competition. As I said before in other comments This truly is a very talented group and I hope they move on and enjoy their careers.
I think your comments are for the part almost abusive. I like to see you do better against any one of them! You asked!
Singing is not Charlie’s job. Being a critic IS. (A person who judges the merits of literary, artistic, or musical works, especially one who does so professionally.)
Abusive??? Grow up. No one received less than an “average” grade? Charlie was simply clairying why some PERFORMANCES were mediocre (or inconsistant) and others exceptional – within the CONTEXT of the show.
Song choice, people! Anybody, and I mean anybody, can sing Yesterday. Madison was my least favorite. SO BORING. Nathan showed how it’s done.
Nathan, Asher, Karen, Bryan, & Josh were my favorites!  Strong song choices that were delivered well.  Maddi, Madison, Tae, Nadege, Serenity, Zoe, & L. did OK, but didn’t really stand out to me.  Maybe song choices, occasional pitch issues, nerves?  Will be interesting to see who the top 9 are tonite!
Nathan was my top favorite followed closely by Asher and Josh.  Madison was my favorite of the girls.
I think Zoe, L. Rodgers and Nadege should go home.  The others were okay but not outstanding.
I was speaking with my roommate and we both agreed that the song choices are very boring this year. Almost everyone doing ballads but no high energy standouts except one. They need to bring in the fun.
Nathan was off the charts! His energy, voice and performance was A+++++
He’s in a different level, just love him!
I think these judges are trying not to hurt people feelings But that is not how you win
Nathan was undeniably the best last night. Showmanship, vocals, energy — he was flawless. Asher was very good as well.
But what killed almost everyone else, for me, was their sleepy song choices. Even Madison, who gave a lovely vocal, chose a song with almost no range. L. Rodgers, who I love, was completely unmemorable. Almost every other episode this season has had FAR more interesting, upbeat performances than this live night. Step it up, coaches and producers!
I really love Rock and Pop and so I voted for Bryan Olesen (cause I think he’s great) on the Voice app.
However, as far as last night’s performances…bar none, Nathan totally gave the best performance and I really loved his song choice. 🎵 So in this TVLine survey, he got my vote!
Think your review is spot on! For a lot of the same reasons I felt as well, you just described it better! I think all of these folks have enough chops to succeed and I usually feel that way with the Voice. My four in order from low to high probability: Josh Sanders, Karen and Asher are a downright tie both so good in their own genres, and then Nathan. My only issue with Nathan is I enjoy his older stuff so much it’s easy to get locked into nostalgia and then you’re doing a Vegas show. But the voice and stage presence are killer. Wishing all 12 the best, such a good show this season!
Right nobody is Freddie mercury but felt Bryan gave a strong likeness and best singer of the 12.
I’m not a fan of the contestants choosing their own songs. They always seem to pick wrong.
And when they choose one based on sentiment, they almost always lose 🙈 And I think one of the main reasons is familiarity with the song.
