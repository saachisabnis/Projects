Billie Eilish's follow-up to Happier Than Ever could be arriving soon, as the singer revealed on Instagram yesterday that “my album is mastered.” She didn't reveal any other details, but mastering is typically the final step in the recording process before it's pressed and distributed.
Eilish last teased the record's progress in September. “There is lots of music coming,” she told The Cookout. “There is a whole album of music coming. We’re in the final stages of making it, so that doesn’t mean it’s about to come out, but it is getting there, and it’s very exciting.”
Since Happier Than Ever arrived in 2021, Eilish has released the two-track EP Guitar Songs and the Barbie theme 'What Was I Made For?,' which could earn her and Finneas their second Academy Awards next month.
