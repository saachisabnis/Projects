Erwin Celestin, widely known by his stage name “ERW!N,” is a rising star from Orlando, Florida. Born in 2004 and currently 20 years old, ERW!N has been making music for over three years. His journey into the music world began thanks to a good friend, Kymani, also known as “YRB Mani.” Together, they embarked on a musical adventure that has seen ERW!N grow from a high school student dabbling in GarageBand to a promising artist ready to release his latest single, “SexSeeLuhv! 2 (Prod. Frozy),” available on all streaming services on August 2, 2024.
Reflecting on his beginnings, ERW!N recalls, “At the start of my senior year in high school, I was still in the mindset of what life is gonna be like after I graduate. One day, my friend told me to record a song with him on GarageBand just for the fun of it. After completing the song, I eventually realized how much potential we truly had and just kept going from there.”
This casual start led ERW!N to discover BandLab, an app that significantly improved the sound quality of his recordings. Excited by this discovery, he shared it with YRB Mani, and together they continued to create music, setting the stage for ERW!N’s future projects.
During his senior year, ERW!N released four projects and three singles through UnitedMasters. However, it wasn’t until after graduation that he began to take music seriously, switching to DistroKid for his releases. This shift marked a new chapter in his musical career, characterized by a deeper commitment to his craft and a broader exploration of his musical influences.
ERW!N’s music is defined by his passion for Pluggnb, a fusion of ‘Plugg’ and ‘R&B’ genres. This unique blend combines the production style of Plugg with the melodic, dreamy synths of contemporary R&B. ERW!N cites artists like Autumn!, Summrs, and Texako as significant influences in his exploration of Pluggnb.
“Just as rare as my name is, that’s how unique I am as a person, and I think it shows a lot throughout my music. As versatile as I can be and have shown throughout multiple songs, my core passion leans towards making music through an underground genre of music called Pluggnb,” ERW!N explains.
ERW!N’s dedication to his craft is evident in his recent projects. His mixtape “Lover’s Alley 2” is a testament to his versatility and his mastery of the Pluggnb genre. This project, along with his upcoming single “SexSeeLuhv! 2 (Prod. Frozy),” showcases his evolution as an artist and his ability to push the boundaries of his music.

For instance, Billie Eilish began making music in her bedroom before achieving international fame. Similarly, ERW!N’s story highlights the importance of early influences and the impact of accessible technology like GarageBand and BandLab in nurturing young talent.
As ERW!N continues to grow and evolve, his music promises to offer a unique and refreshing perspective within the music industry. His upcoming single, “SexSeeLuhv! 2 (Prod. Frozy),” is highly anticipated and is expected to further cement his place in the Pluggnb scene.
