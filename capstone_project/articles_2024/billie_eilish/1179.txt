Chappell Roan doubled down on her earlier comments about the election after facing backlash for not officially endorsing a candidate. 
The singer, 26, took to TikTok early Wednesday to clarify her stance, reiterating that while she plans to vote for Kamala Harris, she isn't making a formal endorsement, kicking off her clip with: 'If you don’t understand what I’m saying, it’s a lost cause.'
She added: 'Endorsing and voting are completely different and I don't agree with a lot of what is going on with policies, like obviously f*** the policies on the right... but also f*** some of the policies on the left.
'That why I can’t endorse; I can’t put my entire name or my entire project behind one, because there is no way I can stand behind some of the left’s completely transphobic and completely genocidal views. There are huge problems on both sides.'
The pop star then expressed frustration with both Donald Trump and certain actions within the Democratic Party, stating that both have let down people like her.

'So no, I'm not gonna settle for what the options are in front of me. So yeah, I'm voting for f****** Kamala, but I'm not settling for what has been offered 'cause that's questionable.
'I'm critiquing both sides 'cause they're both so f***** up.'
She captioned the clip, 'And im not forcing you to agree with me. This is my statement. Have a good day.'
The post follows less than 24 hours after she attempted to clarify on TikTok that her election comments from a recent interview with The Guardian were 'taken out of context.'
The star was slammed by fans after she failed to endorse Harris over Trump, and stated 'there's problems on both sides.'
At one point during the nearly three-minute video, Roan - whose real name is  Kayleigh Rose Amstutz - expressed, 'Hear it from my mouth, if you're still wondering. No, I'm not voting for Trump.'
'And yes, I will always question those in power and those making decisions over other people, and I will stand up for what's right and what I believe in, and it's always at the forefront of my project.' 
She also explained, 'I have encouraged people to use critical thinking skills, learn about what they're voting for, learn about who they're voting for and ask questions, and it's being completely taken out of context, per usual.'
She added: 'Endorsing and voting are completely different and I don't agree with a lot of what is going on with policies, like obviously f*** the policies on the right... but also f*** some of the policies on the left'

'There is nuance in what I say in interviews, and I think it's important that people use critical thinking.'
Chappell added, 'I think it's important for me to question authority and question world leaders, and question myself, question my algorithm, question if some person that tweeted something about someone else is even true.'
'It's important to question because that's how I think we move forward,' the performer continued. 
'This is my third election in voting and the world is changing so rapidly, and I want to be part of the generation that changes things for good.' 
Roan then told her followers, 'If you come to my shows, if you read my full interviews, if you literally know anything about what I stand for, you know that this is not lip service.' 
'This is not virtue signaling, that my actions have always paved the way for my project and the people who really know me.'
She further explained, 'Actions speak louder than words and actions speak louder than an endorsement.'  
The Good Luck, Babe! songstress took to her TikTok page on Tuesday to explain that her past comments were 'taken out of context'
At one point during the nearly three-minute video, Roan expressed, 'Hear it from my mouth, if you're still wondering. No, I'm not voting for Trump'
'This is my third election in voting and the world is changing so rapidly, and I want to be part of the generation that changes things for good,' she added 
The TikTok clip - which has currently raked in 2.2 million views - comes after the singer drew ire from fans after she failed to endorse either candidate in an interview with The Guardian published last week on Friday. 
Roan said, 'I have so many issues with our government in every way. There are so many things that I would want to change.' 
She added she 'doesn't feel pressured to endorse someone' because 'there's problems on both sides.'
'I encourage people to use your critical thinking skills, use your vote—vote small, vote for what's going on in your city.'
She added her top issue is trans rights, because 'they cannot have cis people making decisions for trans people, period.' 
Fans took to X to reveal their disappointment over her decision saying: 'I love Chappel but this one has been TOUGH to get over because it's so uneducated.'
Another wrote: 'every time Chappell opens her mouth again she gets worse and worse.'
'how can you be part of the LGBTQ+ community and have tone deaf s**t like this to say so loudly.'
She added she 'doesn't feel pressured to endorse someone' because 'there's problems on both sides'; seen earlier this month in London

'chappell couldve worded this way differently and it wouldve helped her case a lot' while another penned: 'This is very disappointing.' 
Others came out in defense of the star, writing: 'the internet needs to leave chappell alone omfg she literally didn't say anything wrong' and 'I'm so f*****g done with the chappell hate.'
Harris has previously shown herself to be a fan of Roan, and used her track titled, Femininomenon, in a campaign video.
In June, Roan told the crowd at a Governor's Ball festival in New York that she had 'declined' an invitation to perform at a White House Pride event.
She said, 'We want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that's when I'll come.'
Singer Billie Eilish and her brother and collaborator Finneas O'Connell announced they are backing Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 election last week.
Meanwhile Trump has received a controversial endorsement from NFL WAG, Brittany Mahomes. And most recently, motor sports legend, Danica Patrick, also revealed her endorsement for Trump.

Roan recently threated to quit the industry over unwanted attention. 
Chappell, who has been attending therapy sessions twice a week to deal with her new celebrity status, admitted her depression diagnosis came as a shock because she doesn't actually feel 'sad.'
She told the Guardian, 'I'm in therapy twice a week. I went to a psychiatrist last week because I was like, I don't know what's going on.'
'She diagnosed me with severe depression – which I didn't think I had because I'm not actually sad. But I have every symptom of someone who's severely depressed.'
Chappell revealed her symptoms include brain fog, forgetfulness and poor focus as well as 'a very lackluster viewpoint.'
She added, 'I think it's because my whole life has changed. Everything that I really love to do now comes with baggage. If I want to go thrifting, I have to book security and prepare myself that this is not going to be normal.
'Going to the park, pilates, yoga – how do I do this in a safe way where I'm not going to be stalked or harassed?'

The singer went on to explain she thinks her problems stem from how much her life has changed over a short period of time.
Her latest interview comes after she ruffled feathers on last week's VMAs red carpet as she clapped back at a photographer who shouted 'shut the f*** up' as she turned away to adjust her outfit.
The rising entertainer has earned a reputation for being a complainer, with one fan on X hilariously suggesting she change her name to 'Chappell Moan.'
In late August, she also took to TikTok to slam fans who cross her boundaries.
