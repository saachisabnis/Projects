This past week was full of buzzy headlines. Steve Martin dropped some hints about what’s going on between Meryl Streep and Martin Short, but he wanted to be very clear there isn’t a Challengers situation going on. Saturday Night Live continued its golden jubilee with Michael Keaton, Billie Eilish and yet another accusation of plagiarism. The gang from What We Do in the Shadows emerged from their coffins for the last time, and they promised to prioritize comedy over “being sappy” during this farewell season. And Hot Ones continued its infomercial era by bringing Family Guy’s Peter Griffin to the table.
But the funniest headline came courtesy of Dame Helen Mirren. During a conversation on the Brave New World podcast, she shared the one thing she wishes Kurt Cobain got to experience before his untimely death: GPS. Mirren said that it’s “so sad” that the Nirvana frontman never got to relish in the “completely magical and unbelievable” experience of watching his “little blue dot walking down the street.” Mirren described the technological innovation as “the most wonderful thing.”
The week, of course, also came with its fair share of hilarious tweets. The funniest included those about a Halloween scrimmage, an unhinged Lyft ride and a made-up movie we want to see.
