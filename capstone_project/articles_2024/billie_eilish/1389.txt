It’s been another tumultuous year for many people for many reasons, but in the plant-based industry, there has been some big positive change. Billionaires have pledged to help the food system move away from meat, a number of coffee chains have finally stopped penalizing anyone who wants dairy-free milk (over half of the coffee chains in the US, to be more precise), and some of the biggest celebrity names have been playing their role in helping to make plant-based food more accessible to everyone.
Read on to find out more about these major feats in our top 10 stories of the year. The list includes everything from major reports documenting significant sustainable shifts in consumer behavior to groundbreaking health findings.
Hungry for more? Here are the top 10 food stories of 2024.

In March 2024, billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pledged $60 million to help build a more sustainable, plant-forward food system. Via The Bezos Earth Fund, which was first set up in 2020, the Bezos launched the Centers for Sustainable Protein with a goal to advance plant-based and cultivated meat. “We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy, sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet,” Bezos Earth Fund Vice Chair Lauren Sánchez said in a statement. “We can do it, and it will require a ton of innovation.”Read more
Starbucks
In October 2024, Starbucks fans across the US celebrated as the popular coffee chain finally announced it would no longer charge extra for dairy-free milk options. The move came after years of campaigns, including one stunt by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which involved actor James Cromwell gluing himself to a Starbucks counter to protest the charge. Starbucks CEO and chairman Brian Niccol said in a statement: “By removing the extra charge for non-dairy milks, we’re embracing all the ways our customers enjoy their Starbucks.”Read more

Billie Eilish has long been committed to a sustainable, plant-based lifestyle. In September 2024, in partnership with Google Maps, she decided to help others do the same by sharing her 120 favorite vegan eateries across the US. The idea was to help fans find plant-based restaurants to eat ahead of attending her shows during the Hit Me Hard and Soft tour, which commenced in September. “Every action matters, no matter how big or small, and together we can truly begin to heal our beautiful planet,” Eilish said in a statement. “Thanks to Google Maps, everyone will have easy access to resources that will help you make great sustainable choices when you come to my shows.”Read more

In November 2024, an eye-opening report from the Plant Based Foods Institute (PBFI) revealed that millions of Americans are choosing to eschew meat and dairy in favor of plant-based foods. The research, which was put together with help from retail data from Kroger, found that many are choosing to do so for cost-effectiveness, but health and sustainability are also key factors. “The past year has demonstrated that when the prices of animal products also go up, shoppers are willing to be flexible and explore more options, including plant-based,” Linette Kwon, PBFI’s consumer insights and data analyst, said in a statement.Read more

Another report released in October 2024 found that plant-based foods are also a more cost-effective solution for universities. Researchers Chris Bryant, PhD and Billy Nicholles from Bryant Research found that a medium-sized university catering to around 10,000 students could save $650,000 a year if it switched to a plant-based catering model. “In line with a wealth of academic literature, the data in this model is clear: a plant-based transition is an environmental imperative,” they said in a joint statement. They added that “Crucially, we also found that a plant-based transition provides an opportunity for caterers to reduce their food procurement costs. This report gives them the reassurance and guidance they need to kickstart their transition to sustainable menus.”Read more

Mike Tyson is one of the biggest names in boxing, but recently, he’s also turned his attention to plant-based food. The legendary athlete invested in vegan fast-food chain Mr. Charlie’s—which offers an entirely vegan menu inspired by McDonald’s—via his holding company Carma HoldCo. “As someone who embraced a vegan lifestyle for many years, I understand firsthand the power of plant-based eating—not just for our health, but for the planet. Mr. Charlie’s is redefining what fast food can be, offering delicious vegan meals while giving back to communities that need it most,” Tyson told VegNews in October 2024.Read more
NYU
Also in the fall of 2024, New York University (NYU) promised to serve up more plant-based foods in a bid to reduce its emissions. The prestigious institution joined Columbia University, The Rockefeller University, and Fordham University by signing up for the NYC Plant-Powered Carbon Challenge, a voluntary initiative targeted at New York City’s private sector. The idea is to encourage more companies to help build a more sustainable food system. Linda G. Mills, the president of NYU, said in a statement: “Delicious, healthy food helps our community flourish, and reducing the associated carbon footprint helps our planet flourish. NYU is proud to be a part of this initiative and we hope others will join us.”Read more

In July 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) introduced new school meal guidelines encouraging schools to incorporate more plant-based proteins into daily meal programs. Under the new guidance, schools are required to provide children with at least a ¼ cup of beans, peas, or lentils as a meat alternative. As well as promoting plant-based foods, the guidelines move away from a focus on processed and high-fat ingredients, too.Read more

Back in August 2024, the US Open also pledged to sign up for the NYC Plant-Powered Carbon Challenge. As a result, more eateries at future tournaments will serve plant-based options, as the US Open attempts to meet its goal of reducing food-related emissions by 25 percent by 2030. “As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, it’s putting athletes and many of our favorite sporting events at risk,” Kate MacKenzie, the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy, said in a statement. “That’s why we need to draw down our greenhouse gas emissions, starting with food. We are proud to partner with the US Open in their efforts to reduce their food-based emissions through delicious, plant-powered meals.”Read more

In the summer of 2024, new findings from the Stanford twin study—a 2023 study that followed several sets of identical twins to determine the health benefits of a plant-based diet—suggested that eating more plants could decrease a person’s biological age. This was due to its role in supporting DNA methylation—a process that plays a key role in cell function. According to the research, a decrease in biological age was seen in just eight weeks in those following a plant-based diet. “[The research] suggests that anyone who chooses a vegan diet can improve their long-term health in two months, with the most change seen in the first month,” said the study’s senior author Christopher Gardner, PhD.Read more
