A couple's unique way to serve dessert at their wedding has delighted viewers on social media.
The British couple topped their wedding cake‚Äîa large, rounded mille-feuille‚Äîwith a selection of summer berries, fresh creams and a dusting of sugar in front of guests at their reception in Lake Como, Italy.
Hannah Macdonald-Ball, the couple's wedding content creator, captured the moment and shared it to TikTok on June 4. The video, which plays against Billie Eilish's "Birds of a Feather" has been liked more than 1.1 million times to date, and has welcomed a flurry of comments‚Äîeach gushing over the tasteful display.
"You can see my beautiful bride Sophia, known online as @sophiajoee0, and her husband Faisal decorating their wedding cake at Villa Pizzo," Macdonald-Ball told Newsweek. "It was such a special moment after their wedding breakfast to mark the beginning of the party. The guests were served post-dinner espresso martinis while the newlyweds cut the cake and toasted Champagne."
"Once the cake was cut, it was served straight away to the guests, much to their joy! It was a really fun and unique take on cake cutting and made great videos and photos," the wedding creator added.
Macdonald-Ball launched her business, Bride Diaries, in 2023 after walking down the aisle herself. She had previously worked in content creation around food and hotels. She turned to digitally curated weddings because that is where she feels emotion is "at its prime."
"I have now captured 40-plus weddings all over the U.K. and Europe including a three-day-long wedding in the French Alps and of course, many beautiful weddings in stunning Lake Como too," she said.
"Capturing weddings is hard work," Macdonald-Ball added. Although, she is fortunately aided by her husband turned business partner, James, who has a background in amateur wildlife photography. He assists his partner in recording the most aesthetic moments of a couple's special day.
To date, more than 5 million TikTok users have watched Sophia and Faisal adorn their wedding cake with colorful toppings. The moment also saw the groom don a large white chef's hat for comedic effect before popping open another bottle of Champagne.
An overlaid text on the video read: "[Point of view] You decorate your own wedding cake on your wedding day."
"It's something that I treasure," she said. "I have always been a hopeless romantic."
"A live cake session is SUCH a fun way to cut your wedding cake! it is so great for photos too," Macdonald-Ball added under the post, where 900-plus viewers have also left their thoughts on the inventive idea.
"That's so cute," one user wrote.
Another added: "I want that, I love [mille-feuille]"
"My future partner better be rich [because] we're getting married here," a third user shared.
"Sophia and I were both really excited by the amazing response to her cake cutting video. I've had a few videos go viral, but this video has been the most positive, with lots of lovely comments and people saving the idea for their own wedding," said Macdonald-Ball.
