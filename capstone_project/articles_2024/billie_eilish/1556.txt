The stars came out last night for the 96th Annual Academy Awards, and they were all treated to incredible performances while watching the show!  All five original songs that were nominated for Oscars were performed, which included Jon Batiste's "It Never Went Away" from his documentary American Symphony, Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell's "What Was I Made For" from Barbie, Becky G's "The Fire Inside" from Flamin' Hot, Scott George and the Osage Singers "Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People" from Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ryan Gosling's "I'm Just Ken" from Barbie.  While all of the performances and songs were great, a special congratulations goes to Billie Eilish and Finneaus O'Connell for winning the Oscar for best original song, and an extra shoutout to Billie Eilish for becoming the youngest person in Academy Awards history to win two Oscars.
In case you missed it, here are the performances from last night in alphabetical order.
