Black Friday is a special day for shoppers of … anything, really.
But Record Store Day Black Friday is where music fans will flock.
The second part of the annual Record Store Day program promoting independent retailers takes place on Friday, Nov. 29, with nearly two dozen stores taking part. Some will host live performances and appearances — such as members of the ’80s R&B group Eramus Hall celebrating its new rarities album, “Lost and Found,” at 11 a.m. at Dearborn Music, 22501 Michigan Ave., Dearborn.
Most of the interest is in the special and exclusive, mostly vinyl, releases set up explicitly for RSDBF.
Among those are items from the Beatles to Billie Eilish, Santana to Snoop Dogg. Of local interest beyond Erasmus Hall, meanwhile, are a pair of concert albums — the Doors’ “Live in Detroit” from Cobo Arena in 1970, one of the band’s longest shows ever, on four vinyl LPs, and “Big Brother and the Holding Company: Live at the Grande Ballroom Detroit, Michigan: March 2, 1968,” featuring Janis Joplin.
A full list of participating stores and releases can be found at recordstoreday.com.
