	In this year’s clip, the black-haired singer reflected on her “big, big year,” which included the release of her album Hit Me Hard & Soft and her first Oscar win for her Barbie track, “What Was I Made For?” When asked what the “biggest thing to happen” in 2024 was, Eilish responded, “I had the most monthly listeners on Spotify in the entire world. […] I released my album, went on tour again, made so many new friends, adopted another dog. It’s been a friendship-filled year.”

	At one point in the clip, she watches her past self list off the things she wants to accomplish, including skydiving (which she still hasn’t done yet), bungee jumping and more “adventure.”

	Eilish also mentioned wanting to make new friends and “be having good sex,” both of which she checked off the list. “I’ve done nothing but make friends all year and got so close with people that I wasn’t with before,” she noted, before cheekily adding, “And, yes, I’ve had a lot of good sex.”

	In the music world, the multi-Grammy winner shared that she’s been enjoying listening to throwback Lady Gaga songs, including “Alejandro,” “Poker Face” and “Born This Way.” “It’s so good,” Eilish said. 

	Ultimately, Eilish is proud of how far she’s come this year. “I really trust myself now,” she says of how she’s grown in comparison to previous years. “It’s always scary when you fall in love and you dig someone or like someone or whatever it is. It’s hard to know what the hell is going on because you’re blinded by this curtain of lust and admiration. I’ve been very cautious, and I’ve been a really good girl.”

	She concluded, “I can’t believe the way my life is gone, and where it is now.”
