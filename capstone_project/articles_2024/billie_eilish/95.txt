Billie Eilish was struck in the face with flying debris during her concert in Glendale, Arizona on Friday (December 13). 
Video footage captured by a fan (Shred News on TikTok) shows the "Ocean Eyes" hitmaker sitting at the front of the stage singing 2023 hit "What Was I Made For?" when someone from within the crowd suddenly throws a bracelet at her face. 
The object hit Eilish directly on the cheek and landed on the floor in front of her as she paused (stunned, according to TMZ) for a brief moment before continuing where she left off. The "LUNCH" songstress offered a disheartened expression, grabbed the bracelet, and threw it back into the crowd, all while not missing a beat.  
Despite being struck in the face mid-song, Eilish remained composed and chose not to speak to the audience about the incident or single out the fan that thew the bracelet (as many other artists in similar situations have done). 
Fans resounded their support for Eilish in the comment section, commending the star for how she handled the heated situation, while matching her disappointment in the person who threw the bracelet. 
The "bad guy" standout is currently on her Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour with her next show taking place in Inglewood, California on Sunday (December 15).
