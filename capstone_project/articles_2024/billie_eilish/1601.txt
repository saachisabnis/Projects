Viral TikTok star Baylen Dupree has landed her own reality show.
The 22-year-old, who suffers from Tourette syndrome, is opening up her life for the cameras in TLC's Baylen Out Loud.
Baylen already shares her journey dealing with Tourette, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by rapid and repetitive tics and sounds, with her more than 10 million followers. 
'Every day, Baylen faces a variety of extreme and uncontrollable vocal and motor tics while navigating the challenges of becoming an independent adult.,' TLC said in a statement.
'Supported by her loving family in West Virginia, including her five siblings, devoted boyfriend, Colin, protective father, Allen, and strong and independent mother, Julie, Baylen learns to manage the complexities of Tourette and embrace life fully.'
The trailer for Baylen Out Loud features a number of unintentionally comical moments from Baylen's condition, including one scene where she tics and says, 'My mom has crabs!'
'Baylen's realness and humor struck us right away,' TLC president Howard Lee said.
'Her fearless honesty about living with Tourette Syndrome not only busts stereotypes but also builds bridges of understanding,' he added.

Baylen Out Loud has already received a stamp of approval from the Tourette Association of America, who issued a statement in support of the series. 
'The Tourette Association of America congratulates Baylen on her new chapter and are thankful for her efforts to raise awareness of Tourette Syndrome,' they wrote.
'We will be eagerly watching alongside our community and hope it helps to break the stigma faced by all people living with the condition.'
Due to her immense popularity online, Baylen has been subjected to intense trolling and scrutiny.
Naysayers have often accused her of 'faking' her condition for clout, which she has adamantly denied.
'The fact that people think I fake Tourette's or that I don't have Tourette's because I don't tic 24/7 or because their cousin's tics are different than mine says a lot,' she told People back in 2022.
She also denied faking her Tourette's during an appearance on Dr Phil, with Dr Phil himself confirming that he'd seen and validated her personal medical records.
'It's been properly diagnosed, it's one hundred percent genuine,' he stressed.

Last December, Baylen went viral after telling Chris Cuomo to 'f**k off' during an interview on NewsNation.
Minutes into the conversation, Cuomo smiled and laughed when Baylee, in a humorous British accent, said, 'Go f*** yourself, Chris a** bunny, old biscuit fat a**.'
After the tics, she continued the conversation, stating, 'I also receive hate from people who have told me that my parents deserve to die in a car accident.'
Tourette, which usually begins in childhood and is characterized by involuntary motor and vocal tics, is thought to affect around 1.4 million Americans, including Billie Eilish.
Vocal tics include humming or yelling out certain phrases, which Baylen had exhibited throughout her interview with Cuomo by repeatedly saying: 'F**k off, f**k that b**ch.'
Baylen Out Loud will premiere on TLC on January 13.
