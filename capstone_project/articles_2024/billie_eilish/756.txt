Sydney Sweeney was one of the many celebrities in attendance at the Met Gala on Monday, May 6 in New York City.
If you looked at photos from the event too closely, however, you might not notice her as the 26-year-old A-list actress showed up to the event wearing a black wig that was in stark contrast to the blonde bombshell look that we’ve come to expect from her.
Sweeney’s look at the 2024 Met Gala had many people saying that she resembled musician Billie Eilish.

Sweeney is coming off one of the biggest hits of her career as her rom-com Anyone But You alongside Glen Powell racked up over $215 million at the global box office. She also hosted a high-profile episode of Saturday Night Live.
2024 has also seen Sweeney star in the horror film Immaculate and the much-maligned Spider-Man spin-off movie Madame Web. In the coming years, Sweeney is set to star in films such as  Eden alongside Ana de Armas, Echo Valley with Julianne Moore, and a remake of the Jane Fonda sci-fi movie Barbarella that’s rumored to be directed by Edgar Wright.
Sweeney made her breakthrough playing Cassie Howard on the hit HBO show Euphoria and followed that up by starring in projects such as Under the Silver Lake, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Voyeurs, Night Teeth, Reality, The Handmaid’s Tale, Sharp Objects, and The White Lotus.
