My name is Adam, and I’m an Oscars junkie.
In years where I had a much higher proportion of free time, I’d make it a mission to try and see every film and performance nominated in a major category. I don’t always get close to that these days, but that doesn’t stop me from trying to read the tea leaves heading up to Oscar night.
