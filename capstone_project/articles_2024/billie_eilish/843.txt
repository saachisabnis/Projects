Saturday Night Live is closing out season 49 with a bang! 
On May 2, NBC announced the lineup for the final two shows of the season. On May 11, SNL alum Maya Rudolph will return to host the show for the third time alongside musical guest Vampire Weekend. 
A week later, Jake Gyllenhaal will also host for the third time with Sabrina Carpenter joining him as musical guest. 
But before all that, Dua Lipa will pull double duty as both host and musical guest on May 4 as she continues to promote her upcoming third studio album, Radical Optimism.
"DOUBLE DUTY DUA," the "Levitating" singer previously wrote on Instagram, just one day after dropping "Illusion," the new song off the highly anticipated release. 
The hosting gig will immediately follow the May 3 release of Radical Optimism, which the singer first announced back in March. 
It's been an epic season of SNL thus far as Saltburn star Jacob Elordi helmed the first episode of the new year, alongside musical guest Reneé Rapp. Following Dakota Johnson and Justin Timberlake's SNL return on Jan. 27, The Bear star Ayo Edebiri made her SNL debut, alongside returning musical guest Jennifer Lopez. Season 49 has also included host and musical guest appearances from Josh Brolin, Ariana Grande, Emma Stone and Sydney Sweeney. 
The NBC sketch comedy show kicked off its 49th season on Oct. 14, and brought SNL alum Pete Davidson back to Studio 8H to host the premiere. SNL was forced to go dark and cut its 48th season short due to the Writers Guild of America strike. However, with the WGA reaching a deal with the AMPTP, Saturday Night Live was able to return to TV.
Check out the full list of the hosts and musical guests who are lending their talent to season 49.
