The 2024 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show returned earlier this month, and its effect is already setting a new bar for what’s sexy this Halloween.
Case in point? Sami Sheen, who took to Instagram on Sunday, October 27, dressed as a VS Angel while also showing off her new figure and breast implants.
Sami, 20, posted a carousel of photos while wearing a lacy white push bra and matching panties, plus the brand’s signature pink-and-white silk striped robe. To complete the look, she added feather-trimmed angel wings and towering silver heels with a spangly platform.
The daughter of Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards posed alongside her friend, who was dressed as a Playboy Bunny.
For jewelry, Sami added thin silver hoop earrings and a dazzling belly-button ring, which highlighted her toned midsection. Amplifying the effect was a spray tan, but of course.
Sami, who has been on OnlyFans since June 2022, had fun in front of the camera, taking a few requisite candid snaps while on the dance floor at a pre-Halloween party this past weekend.
Sami’s glam was nothing if not angel-worthy, replete with waist-skimming hair extensions and a glowing complexion made up of rosy cheeks, perfectly contoured skin and a few swipes of strategic highlighter for good measure.
She also swiped on plenty of lip gloss that made for the ultimate pucker-up moment during photos. Just as flirty were Sami’s lash extensions, which she emphasized with brown eyeliner and a touch of white shimmery shadow at the corner of each eye.
Her newly curvaceous figure comes nearly a year after Sami announced via social media in November 2023 that she previously underwent breast implant surgery, despite her mother’s misgivings.
“Guess who got a new rack todayyy,” she captioned an Instagram Story of her in a hospital gown, according to news reports. In another slide, Sami posted a mirror selfie that revealed the markings drawn on her body by the plastic surgeon.
Two weeks prior to that, Sami shared that she’d wanted breast implants since she was a young girl.
“I was 10 years old and like, ‘I can’t wait to have big boobs like my mom,’” she told Bustle in October 2023. “All my friends were getting boobs, and I was just like, ‘OK, when’s it my turn?’ I would always stuff my bra with socks and stuff.”
However, Denise, now 53, admitted that she wasn’t on board with the idea of her daughter getting breast implants. (Richards shares daughters Sami and Lola, 18, with ex-husband Charlie. She is also mother of daughter Eloise, 12, who she adopted in 2011.)
“I’m trying to talk her out of it because, and the reason why I’m getting them out, is I didn’t know how toxic [they are] when I was 19,” the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum also said to Bustle. “And it’s not an easy surgery. It’s painful!”
Denise, who got her breast implants at the same age as her daughter, has previously spoken out about regretting the surgery.

“When I was 19, a doctor put in bigger implants than what I asked for. I was in such a hurry to get them that I didn’t research my doctor,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in 2011. “I just thought because they’re a plastic surgeon, they must be good. You have to be your advocate for your own body and ask 100 questions.”
Sami posted a TikTok in the lead up to the surgery in September 2023, sharing with her followers that she was trying to quit vaping beforehand.
“I’m so scared, and I don’t know how I’m going to live without this thing,” she explained in a TikTok video. “It’s really sad. My whole life revolves around it. I’ve depended on it for so long. I’ve tried quitting multiple times. It’s really f—king hard. I ordered this book called How to Quit Vaping by Allen Carr. Have I started reading it? No, because I don’t want to quit.”
