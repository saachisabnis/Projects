Britney Spears has a few "crazy girl crushes" and she's extremely inspired by each and every one of them. 
The "Womanizer" hitmaker shared a long message to her Instagram Story on Tuesday (October 15), drawing attention to the women who inspire her most and why. 
Spears prefaced the list by reflecting on how some female friendships change as you grow older and grow apart. 
She continued: 
"Years go by and you get married and you grow up and you live worlds apart and it's called life!! I have girlfriends I hang out with every now and then but it's not the same as when we were younger. But why isn't it???" 
The "...Baby One More Time" artist proceeded to list the female celebs that inspire her most including Natalie Portman (because she met her walking her dog once and they were wearing the same shirt and she seemed like the coolest person ever), Pamela Anderson (because she's classic and seems so sweet), Camila Cabello (because she is pretty and her silliness makes Spears laugh out loud), and Kendall Jenner, Selena Gomez, and Drew Barrymore, because they are all "literally gorgeous." 
According to Page Six, Spears has also refereed to Taylor Swift as a "girl crush" praising the star for her talents in a 2023 interview where she detailed their first meeting. 
"We took a picture, and she then became the most iconic pop woman of our generation. Kinda cool she plays stadiums, and I prefer her videos over movies any day. Sheâ€™s stunning!!! Girl crush."
