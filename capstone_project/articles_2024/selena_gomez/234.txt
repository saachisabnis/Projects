Selena Gomez looked stunning as she stepped out in full glam Friday night after fans speculated that Hailey Bieber shaded her with an Instagram post earlier in the day.
The actress, 31, dressed up to support her “Only Murders in the Building” co-star Steve Martin at the premiere of his documentary, “Steve! (Martin): A Documentary in 2 Pieces.”
Gomez wore a chic form-fitting, black midi dress that featured long sleeves and several bows decorating the neckline. She kept warm in sheer stockings and paired the all-black look with pointed-toe heels.
Gomez kept her jewelry simple with the Giardini Segreti floral earrings and two diamond rings by Pasquale Bruni. She styled her thick brunette hair in a low bun.
The “Single Soon” hitmaker’s outing took place hours after she was thrust back into the headlines over a screenshot Bieber posted of Beyoncé’s cover of “Jolene” — a Dolly Parton song infamously about a woman enamored with a married man.
The Rhode Skin creator, 27, wrote, “whew 😤,” over the screenshot, which many perceived was her way of implying that someone was currently trying to steal her husband, Justin Bieber. 
Several fans took Hailey’s post as an indirect jab at her longstanding frenemy, Gomez.
The two women have had drama ever since Hailey got engaged to Justin, 30, months after he and Gomez ended their own romance for good.
However, the “Lose You to Love Me” singer and model have pleaded with fans over the years to stop pitting them against each other time and time again. 
Hailey explained during an appearance on Bloomberg’s “The Circuit with Emily Chang” in July 2023 that the feud was “about the vile, disgusting hatred that can come from completely made-up and twisted and perpetuated narratives,” adding, “That can be really dangerous.”

Prior to that, during a September 2022 episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, the daughter of Stephen Baldwin claimed she had no beef with Gomez at all.
“It’s all respect. It’s all love,” she told host Alex Cooper at the time.
“Neither of us owe anybody anything except respect. I respect her a lot, and I think there are no expectations [between us]. I respect her.”
Gomez also stood up for Hailey when fans trolled her on social media last year because they believed the model shaded the “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum in a TikTok with Kendall Jenner and Justin Skye. 
“This isn’t what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying,” Gomez shared in an Instagram Story post in February 2023.
“I’ve always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop. ❤️.”
