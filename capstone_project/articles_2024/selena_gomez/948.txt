Selena Gomez is proud of her man, Benny Blanco, who was recently featured in PEOPLE magazine as part of their "Sexiest Man Alive" issue.
On Instagram, Gomez shared a photo from Benny's "Sexiest Man Alive" shoot as he's laying across a desk with a fresh plate of homemade Taco Bell. She wrote along with the picture, "Not only do you love me unconditionally, you always get me my Taco Bell Mexican pizza."
On the next slide, she shared a quote from author William C. Hannan, which reads, "I still haven't figured out how to sit across from you, and not be madly in love with everything you do," and tagged Benny.
In the PEOPLE interview, Blanco opened up about his relationship with Gomez, who he called his "true best friend that I get to do everything in the world with, and every day is the best day of my life." He also shared that they both go "all out" for dates for each other, recalling one date where Gomez rented out "a whole botanical garden" for her boyfriend. But, they also appreciate the simple things. Benny told PEOPLE, "For Valentine's Day, I got her Taco Bell, I made her movie-theater nachos, I found her favorite pickles from Texas and I deep-fried them for her. Then [I had] all her candies and Hot Cheetos."
That certainly is true love.
