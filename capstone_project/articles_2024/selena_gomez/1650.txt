The Oscar-winner, 75, and 74-year-old comic play love interests in the Hulu show were seen at the event along with Steve Martin, 79, at the Paramount lot in Los Angeles, months after Martin’s representative said they were just “very good friends”.
They were also seen laughing and joking for a series of photos along with their other co-star Selena Gomez, 32.
‘The Devil Wears Prada’ actress Meryl and ‘Three Amigos’ star Martin first sparked romance rumours when they were seen looking cosy with each other at the 2024 Golden Globe Awards in January.
Martin’s spokesperson told People after gossip grew: “(They) are just very good friends, nothing more.”

Martin and Meryl have grown close since starring together in ‘Only Murders in the Building’.

One fan said on X after they were snapped together looking intimate at the Globes: “Meryl Streep and Martin Short allegedly dating is now my Roman Empire.”

In October, it was revealed Meryl had split from her husband of 45 years, Don Gummer.

A spokesperson for the actress revealed at the time the pair had been quietly “separated for more than six years” and living different lives.

Even though the former couple had not been seen together since 2018, Meryl was photographed wearing her wedding ring up until the news of their split broke.

The ‘Mama Mia!’ star and sculptor Don, 77, have four children, while Martin’s late wife Nancy Dolman, lost her battle with ovarian cancer in 2010 aged 58 after they had three children together.
