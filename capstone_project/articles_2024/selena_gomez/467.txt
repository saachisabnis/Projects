Memphis handed UConn a devastating blow, defeating the two-time defending national champions 99-97 in overtime.
Tyrese Hunter dazzled in the first round of the Maui Invitational on Nov 25 (Monday), scoring 17 of his 26 points after halftime.
Hunter also tied his career high with seven 3-pointers, as the unranked Tigers triumphed over No. 2 UConn.
With less than a minute left to play, UConn coach Dan Hurley's outburst aimed at the refs due to an over-the-back foul called on Liam McNeeley, earned him a technical foul.
The controversial call allowed PJ Carter to hit four straight three throws 92-all game into a 96-92 Memphis lead — Two for the technical and two for a personal foul.
