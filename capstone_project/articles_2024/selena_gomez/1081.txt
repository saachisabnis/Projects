Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” refuses to concede its spot atop the Mediabase hot adult contemporary radio chart, notching a staggering eighteenth week at #1.
The enduring smash hit received ~5,606 spins during the January 7-13 tracking period, trailing last week’s figure by 92 but keeping the song at #1.
Rema & Selena Gomez’s “Calm Down,” an enduring hit in its own right, holds at #2 this week.
Miley Cyrus’ “Used To Be Young” stays at #3, while Paul Russell’s “Lil Boo Thang” enjoys a one-place lift to #4.
