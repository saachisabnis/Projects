Selena Gomez posted two swimsuit photos taken by paparazzi on her Instagram Story—and used them to make a very honest confession about her own ongoing journey to body acceptance. Gomez’s first photo was from October 2013, when she was 21 years old. She wore a zebra swimsuit and appeared very toned. “Today, I realized I will never look like this again...” she wrote.
She shared a second photo from January 2023, where she wore a black and white swimsuit. She was 30 years old in the photo, and her figure was toned, but different from her 21-year-old frame. (Understandable, as every woman’s body changes as she ages, even during her 20s.) “I’m not perfect but I am proud to be who I am...sometimes I forget it’s ok to be me,” she shared.
Gomez has modeled swimsuits for her friend’s swimsuit brand and posted her own bathing suit photos over the last few years:

She has also been open about her journey to accepting her body, especially as she has been treated for lupus and bipolar depression.
She spoke openly last March about being body-shamed as she privately coped with lupus. “My weight would constantly fluctuate because I would be on certain medications,” she said. “And obviously, people just ran with it....It was like they couldn’t wait to find a thing to bring me down. I was being shamed for gaining weight because of my lupus.”
She revealed that some posts she shared celebrating her body were coping mechanisms.
“I lied. I would go online and I would post a picture of myself and I would say, ‘It doesn’t matter. I’m not accepting what you’re saying,’” Gomez recalled. “All the while, being in the room posting and crying my eyes out because nobody deserves to hear those things. Though I was posting these things saying it doesn’t bother me, because I didn’t want it to bother other people who are experiencing the same thing, getting shamed for what they look like, who they are, who they love....I just think it’s so unfair. I don’t think that anybody deserves to feel less than.”
