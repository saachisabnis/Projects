GULFWEEKLY: SEASON four of mystery, comedy-drama show Only Murders in the Building is set to premiere on Hulu on August 27.
Starring Selena Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short, the American series focuses on a trio of strangers - Mabel Mora, Charles-Haden Savage and Oliver Putnam - that shares an interest in true-crime podcasts.
The three become friends while investigating suspicious murders in the Arconia apartment building, and start to produce their own podcast about the cases.
The series is set to pick up from the third season’s cliff-hanger finale, investigating the mysterious murder of Sazz Pataki, Charles’ stunt double. Charles is a professional actor.
The last season also introduced Loretta Durkin, played by Meryl Streep, who is set to reappear in the new episodes.
Selena recalled the atmosphere when the well-respected talent came on set.
“She told everybody that she loves the show, and I don’t even think I spoke the first day she was around, I was just admiring her. She’s an inspiration, and she’s someone who is incredibly talented while being very humble, professional and kind. I’ve learned so much from her just by her being Meryl,” Selena said.
Following its premiere in 2021, the comedic crime series was received with critical acclaim, earning nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2022, 2023 and this year.
The new season will run until October 29.
