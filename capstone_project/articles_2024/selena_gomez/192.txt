From Sabrina Carpenter paying homage to Olivia Newton John to Lizzo dressing as Ozempic
Now that Halloween is officially over, check out how stars from across music, film and television celebrated the holiday below.
Earlier this week, Sabrina Carpenter covered Olivia Newton-John‘s ‘Hopelessly Devoted To You’ while dressed as Sandy from Grease, complete with Carpenter curls in her hair, a black leather jacket and Sandy’s iconic catsuit, during a stop on her ‘Short ‘N’ Sweet’ US tour.
Elsewhere, Heidi Klum once again delivered theatrics during the 23rd instalment of her iconic Halloween parties. This time, Klum and her husband, German guitarist Tom Kaulitz, dressed as E.T. The New York Times interviewed Klum about putting the costume together – “They have no genitals,” Ms. Klum said of the aliens. “I like the whole idea of, like, we’re all the same.”
She wasn’t the only one to take inspiration from the Steven Spielberg classic, with Janelle Monae also opting for an E.T. costume during an appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show. Hudson, meanwhile, paid homage to the late Whitney Houston through her costume.

Lizzo debuted a handful of costumes this year, including a ‘Face Card’ and Edward ‘SZAhands’ – a mashup between the classic film and the R&B singer. Notably, though, she took the occasion to once again address Ozempic allegations, by dressing as a glam version of the diet-suppressing drug.
Christina Aguilera kept it creepy as a vampire, complete with fake blood, while Chloe Bailey dressed up as Jessica Rabbit. Paris Hilton paid homage to Britney Spears, donning a costume inspired by the pop star’s ‘…Baby One More Time’ music video.
