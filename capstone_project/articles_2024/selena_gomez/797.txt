Zoe Saldana made a colorful splash at the Critics Choice Association’s 4th annual Celebration of Latino Cinema and Television in Los Angeles Tuesday night.
The “Avatar” actress, who was honored with the Groundbreaker Award at the ceremony, stepped out in a cornflower blue silk dress with a high neck and an open back. The sleeveless ankle-length dress featuring a ribbed knit navy belt design is from Brandon Maxwell‘s spring 2025 collection. On foot, Saldana wore Aquazzura’s “Talk to Me” slingback sandals.
The strappy style is crafted from black suede and set on a skinny stiletto heel measuring just over 4 inches tall. Furthermore, the sandal is designed with a rounded toe and slender straps that come together in an asymmetrical fashion.
