We didn't recognise her for a hot second
Selena Gomez has sent fans into a total frenzy with the drop of her new single and its accompanying video, Love On. And yes, the new tune is a bop, but it's the lewks that we are simply obsessed with. The whole video has a retro French Riviera grand hotel vibe, and features look after look of vintage perfection. But the one look that stood out to us is clearly Sel's fave too, as she chose it to front her IG grid post. 
Selena has gone fully Jackie Kennedy with this incredible retro bouffant bob haircut. Just look at it. We almost didn't recognise her for a hot second.
Cut below the jaw but skimming above the shoulders, the dark bob is packed with glossy volume, rises to a spectacular bouffant,  and features a deep fringe parted gently in the middle. Her fushia high-neck dress and white gloves only further the homage to the fashion icon.
She also shared a peak at the video with the caption: "Clock in, baby get to work‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúLove On‚Äù is OUT NOW! ‚ô•Ô∏è". And you really need to get a look at the rest of the styling. That bouffant pony with the long white bow? Capital A adorable. 
We can't imagine how long she spent in the hair and makeup chair for each of these countless looks, but we're so glad she did because this buffet of beauty is exactly how we needed to end our week.
