Hailey Bieber just scored a new look.
The Rhode founder brought her beauty A-game to the 2024 Super Bowl on Feb. 11, as she sported a subtle, yet striking transformation of dark chocolate brown tresses while enjoying the game with Justin Bieber. 
Although Hailey is known for her signature brunette locks, she upped the ante by going even darker and having an almost black hair color. She styled her new 'do in effortless waves with a center part.
The 27-year-old also added an unexpected twist to her minimalistic attire for the NFL game in Las Vegas between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers (See all of the celebs cheering on the teams here).
If anything, Hailey seemingly tapped into TikTok's "Mob Wife" aesthetic, pairing a fuzzy animal-print coat from Saint Laurent with a white T-shirt and denim pants. Her husband slightly coordinated with her, wearing a light brown shirt from Marine Serre that featured its crescent moon print and a black ball cap.
However, the couple doesn't always coordinate.
"It's so funny because I see so many people talk about this," she told GQ Hype in an interview published Oct. 24, before explaining Justin usually gets ready first. "He may want to wear baggy sweats to dinner, and I might want to wear a tiny little dress just because that's how I'm feeling."
The makeup mogul noted, "We can't sit there and be like, 'So I'm going to wear this and you're going to wear this.'"
It's clear Hailey was feeling a new hair change. Keep reading to see which other celebrities have had epic makeovers in recent months.
