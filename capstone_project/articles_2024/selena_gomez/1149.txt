Selena Gomez began her acting career at age 7 on the children’s show Barney & Friends with fellow future Disney star Demi Lovato. After taking on minor roles on Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, Gomez was cast as Alex Russo on Disney Channel’s Wizards of Waverly Place. The success of Wizards facilitated Gomez’s rise as a teen idol and one of the highest paid children’s TV stars of all time.
Signing a deal with Hollywood Records at age 16, Gomez got her start in the music industry with her band, Selena Gomez & the Scene. The group went on to release three studio albums from 2009 to 2011. Leaving her clean-cut Disney persona behind, Gomez starred in the provocative film Spring Breakers in 2012. The following year, she released her first solo album, Stars Dance, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In October 2015, Gomez released Revival, followed by her third studio album, Rare, in 2020. In March 2021, she dropped the Spanish EP Revelación.
Gomez dated Nick Jonas from 2008 to 2009 and briefly in 2010, before sparking a romance with pop star Justin Bieber. Gomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2010 to 2014 and from 2017 to 2018. Bieber subsequently moved on with now-wife Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin). Gomez was briefly linked to The Weeknd in 2017 and to Zayn Malik in 2023. She got engaged to Benny Blanco in December 2024 after more than one year of dating.
Gomez has been candid through the years about her struggle with lupus, an autoimmune disease for which she received chemotherapy as treatment. In 2016, she took a break from social media and canceled much of her Revival Tour due to mental health issues linked to her lupus. She underwent a kidney transplant in 2017 thanks to an organ donation from her friend Francia Raisa. Gomez chronicled her struggles with lupus and bipolar disorder in her 2022 documentary, Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me.
Along with founding her successful makeup line, Rare Beauty, in 2020, Gomez kicked off her producing career with the Netflix hit series 13 Reasons Why. She has since produced the docuseries Living Undocumented and her Max cooking series, Selena + Chef.
In 2021, Gomez made her TV comeback on Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building, which she executive produces alongside costars Steve Martin and Martin Short. In 2025, Gomez and her costars won the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.
In 2024, she received two 2025 Golden Globes nominations. One for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series, Comedy in Only Murders in the Building and another for Best Supporting Female Actor, Film in Emilia Pérez.
