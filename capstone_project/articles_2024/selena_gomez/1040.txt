Eva Longoria is currently starring on Apple TV+’s “Land of Women,” but that’s not her only TV project this year: She’ll also be seen on Season 4 of “Only Murders in the Building” later this summer.
“It was announced I was on the show, and [friends] were like, ‘Who? What character are you playing? Are you the murderer?'” Longoria told IndieWire. “And I was like, ‘No. But I will tell you, it’s the best character I’ve ever played in my life: It’s me!'”
Yes, Eva Longoria stars as Eva Longoria in the upcoming meta season, which finds the fearless podcasters and amateur detectives played by Martin Short, Steve Martin, and Selena Gomez traveling to Los Angeles to witness the filming of a movie based on their first podcast season. Longoria stars as a version of herself playing Gomez’s character, Mabel, in the movie. And she’s excited to go full comedy.

“I have such funny lines,” Longoria teased. “The showrunner called me the other day, and he goes, ‘Episode 7, my husband and I are crying laughing, we can’t get through the edit, I can’t even give notes because he has to keep rewinding and we keep laughing.’ But also hello! Meryl Streep, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, Eugene Levy, Steve, Marty, Selena I’m like, pinch me, I’m dreaming. To be on that set was pretty unreal. To be with Meryl? My god.”
After years of focusing on her directing career — including 2023 biopic “Flamin’ Hot” and 2022 documentary “La Guerra Civil” — it’s been a pleasure to have Longoria back on camera for a weekly series with “Land of Women.” And even better that “Only Murders in the Building” brings her back just a month after the season finale of “Land of Women” when it premieres August 26.
“My agent said, ‘You are acting this year. Back in front of the camera. Not directing anything.’ And I was like, ‘OK?’ And then I was kinda cool with it!”
“Land of Women” premieres its season finale July 24 on Apple TV+.
