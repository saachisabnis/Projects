FEKKAI announced the launch of its first-ever professional ambassador program: The FEKKAI FIVE Collective. This collective brings together five of the most influential hairstylists to celebrate the brand's 35th anniversary. Founded by Frédéric Fekkai in 1989, FEKKAI is known for its haircare with French flair and cult-favorite product collection. The FEKKAI FIVE campaign is a new initiative that brings together five influential and accomplished hairstylists in the industry handpicked by Frédéric himself: Jenny Cho, Marissa Marino, Lona Vigi, Graham Nation, and Marty Harper.
"The FEKKAI FIVE collaboration is a celebration of beauty in all its forms, a testament to the transformative power of hairstyling to an overall look and the confidence it portrays."
— Frédéric Fekkai, Founder
Each stylist represents their own individual mastery and brings a unique style and artistic background to the collective. Frédéric's iconic transformative vision aligns perfectly with the diverse talents of the FEKKAI FIVE stylists.
