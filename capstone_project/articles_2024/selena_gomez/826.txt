Gomez confirmed in December that she and Blanco were dating after years of knowing each other, saying he is "my absolute everything in my heart." A source recently told People that the pair are "so in love" and that Gomez's relationship with Blanco is "the best she's ever been treated by a guy."
The "Love On" singer is not paying attention to the drama some fans seemingly want to see after Bieber, whom Gomez dated off and on from 2010 to 2018, announced that he and his wife are having a baby, per Entertainment Tonight. Gomez has shared her support for Hailey Bieber in the past, squashing rumors of a feud between the two and even posing for photos together.
