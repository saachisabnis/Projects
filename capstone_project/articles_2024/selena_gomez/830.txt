Today, Yola announced details of a forthcoming EP project titled, My Way, landing May 24. Executive produced by Yola and Sean Douglas, a Grammy Award-winning producer noted for his work with artists including Lizzo, Chris Brown, Madonna, Selena Gomez and Sia. Yola also confirmed “Future Enemies” will be the first single from the EP, released on February 9.
Yola will be taking this new music on the road, with a fan-first touring experience, designed to give fans a first listen to the forthcoming EP. The My Way: An Intimate Tour will see Yola performing shows in limited capacity sized rooms across select cities including Racket in New York, The Atlantis in D.C., El Rey in Los Angeles, Terminal West in Atlanta, and Basement East in Nashville, with tickets on sale on Friday, January 19, further information below and here.
Says Yola: “Welcome to my new era: a utopia of black creativity, freedom and power. I cannot wait for fans to hear my new music – written and conceived in rooms of diversity – inspired by music I’ve long loved from Janet Jackson to Anderson.Paak to Mary J. Blige. I’m taking these new songs on the road to play for fans to hear it first in intimate venues– true fans know I’ve always been genre-fluid, experimenting and reworking my catalogue through live performance to encompass my love of soul, R&B, electronica and beyond. If you’ve seen the shows you already know where this is heading. This new music is the culmination of that work. This project is also born of my desire to surround myself with creatives of color, to express myself on every level of making this music, and finally, to do this all my way.”
TOUR DATES:
3/6 – Nashville, TN – The Basement East
3/8 – Atlanta, GA – Terminal West
3/22 – Pelham, TN – The Caverns Session PBS Taping
