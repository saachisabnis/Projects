Cara Delevingne and Taylor Swift have had some adventures together. While the two have long been friends, the model recently revealed that she and Swift were roommates at one point and got up to all kinds of stuff together.
Delevingne discussed her relationship with Swift in an Interview article with Nikki Glaser. The two were discussing the topic of comedy roasts and whether Swift should be involved in one. While Glaser, a self-proclaimed Swiftie, said that she didn't want anyone to be mean to Swift, Delevingne believes Swift can hold her own. 
“I could definitely roast her, because I lived with her for a little bit," she said. 
“I was going through a really horrible breakup, and she let me live with her. We’re very different people,” she continued. 
“She’s very homely, because she looked after me so well, but we got into some—not trouble, but I definitely took her for a bit of a wild ride. Just to get her to blush would be great.”
Delevingne also described Swift as a funny person who can roast people expertly. “The thing about Taylor, though, is I’ve seen her do a speech at someone’s wedding before, and it was a roast," she said. 
“She’s one of the funniest, most clever people. Anyone could roast her easily, but at the same time, she could f**k everyone up so hard.”
Swift and Delevingne have been friends for years, with the two supporting each other in different important occasions. Delevingne supported Swift at one of her Eras Tour concerts while Swift was spotted attending a performance of "Cabaret" in London, which starred Delevingne.
When discussing Swift's highly publicized relationship with Travis Kelce, Delevingne had some nice words of support for her friend. “There’s definitely something very different about them,” she said to E! News.
“I’m always rooting for my girl.”
