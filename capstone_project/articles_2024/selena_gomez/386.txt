Pop superstar Taylor Swift cheered on her pal Cara Delevingne during a performance in London.
Delevingne has been showcasing her acting chops as Sally Bowles in Cabaret at the revered London Palladium for a month - a role iconically portrayed by Liza Minnelli.
Swift, who is currently in the UK getting ready for her highly anticipated Eras Tour, caused quite a stir among theatre-goers when she was spotted in the audience supporting her friend. The duo's history goes back to 2015 when Delevingne starred in Taylor's star-studded music video for "Bad Blood" alongside other famous faces like Gigi Hadid and Selena Gomez.

Swifties were quick to post about the star sighting at Delevingne's show on social media platforms. An excited fan tweeted: " Taylor Swift? ? Was supporting Cara Delevingne? ? At Cabaret? ? ? TONIGHT."
Another admirer posted a clip from one of Swift's popular songs 'Anti-hero', while others shared their joy and surprise. One shocked follower wrote: "Taylor went to Cara's musical," while another comment read: "It's amazing."
The Shake It Off singer jetted into London from Paris, where she had just finished performing a round of record-selling shows. In related news, Swift's dedicated fandom is already arriving in droves in Edinburgh ahead of her scheduled Eras Tour performances this weekend.
The 34-year-old pop sensation will be hitting the road for a two-month tour across the UK and Ireland, with her first performance scheduled at Murrayfield Stadium on June 7. The venue is currently undergoing final preparations for her three-night stint.
Ellie Poulter, a 19-year-old superfan, embarked on a fourteen-hour bus journey from Oxfordshire to ensure she was first in line for Taylor's concert. She was even camping outside the stadium to secure the best spot.

Drone images reveal that other fans are also began to gather at Murrayfield Stadium days in advance, with long queues already forming prior to concert day. It's estimated that around 220,000 people will flock to the sold-out show this Friday.
Edinburgh is fully embracing the Taylor mania, with large welcoming signs displayed in shop windows throughout the city. Local shops have started selling 'in my Swiftie era' T-shirts, and the arena has cheekily renamed its Scottish Gas sponsorship to 'Scottish Lass'.
Paramore will be joining Taylor as the supporting act for the UK and Ireland leg of her tour. Tickets were initially released back in August 2023 and were snapped up almost immediately.
