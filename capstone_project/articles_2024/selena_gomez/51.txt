Taylor Swift arrived at Arrowhead Stadium, where temps were in the negatives on Saturday (Jan. 13), to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce as the Kansas City Chiefs took on the Miami Dolphins. The singer was bundled up for the bitter, below-zero cold in a winter beanie, black boots and a puffy coat that boasted her support for Kelce’s number, 87.

	Swift and Chiefs fans alike immediately took note of her unique ’87’ jacket. The coat was designed by Kristin Juszczyk, wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk.

	Swift paired the ’87’ coat with an all-black, casual ensemble, topped off with what appeared to be Louboutin combat boots.

	While Swift watched the Wild Card playoff game, the camera captured her chatting with Kelce’s mom, Donna. Swift was seen covering her mouth as they talked — perhaps to prevent any gossip among internet detectives, like those who believed they could lip-read Selena Gomez’s whispered conversation with her at last weekend’s Golden Globes.
