wearing 14th Addiction + GRISÉ NYC
Rema is spreading the sound of Afrobeats to the world. As music from across the African diaspora climbs international charts, his unique sound has made its mark on the movement. “The way that my sound has evolved is not something that can be explained. It’s something that can be heard,” he tells us for his Schön! 47 digital cover story while on tour in Australia. From his first breakout hit Dumebi in 2019 to the sensation of his 2022 song Calm Down, featuring Selena Gomez on the remix, and his latest album HEIS, which was released this summer, Rema shows no signs of slowing down. 
Rema’s roots lie in Benin City, Nigeria, and inform every fibre of his artistry. “Edo State shaped me in most aspects of my being,” he explains, “from the music, manner of speech, mindset, behavioural traits, just the way I see life in general… my taste in art as well.” Nowhere is this clearer than the visual world of his HEIS era with its darker dominant energy: “It’s just me embracing my growth,” he elaborates. “It’s me feeling comfortable within this music like a snake shedding off the old skin and being comfortable in the new skin. In terms of what message it sends, I think that’s a fan question because, from their perspective, they might get a whole other meaning, either good or bad. For me, it’s just being comfortable in my skin.”
Contributing to the surge in Afrobeats’ international popularity is an impressive badge of honour, but what Rema says he’s really proud of is “being able to give people joy, happiness, peace and escape through my art”. Although only in the early stages of his career, he’s already crafted a signature sound that fulfils his creative desires. His passion represents one of the many beauties of creative expression: ikigai. The Japanese word translates to living with purpose and it’s a concept that Rema is lucky enough to live out daily. “What excites me when I wake up is that I’m alive, that I get to see the people that I love and care about,” he says. “I get to achieve my purpose. I get to create art. I get to see all the gems that God has invested in my soul come out of me. It’s exciting to see every new day.”

“If you keep going like this, you’ll end up alone with cats!” This sharp little phrase, often hurled at single women, links life outside the traditional couple to something inherently negative, as if a life without a man is inevitably sad or incomplete. It’s rooted in the stereotype of the “crazy cat lady,” a caricature of an older woman surrounded by felines, perceived as unhappy and eccentric. This demeaning image reinforces the idea that a woman must define herself through her relationship status or find fulfillment in motherhood.
From the Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise that accused women of being close to their cats of witchcraft, to modern pop culture portrayals like The Simpsons’ “Crazy Cat Lady,” who throws cats at passersby in a state of disarray, the stereotype seems deeply engraved in our collective imagination. Recently, one of Donald Trump’s advisors even labelled presidential candidate Kamala Harris and singer Taylor Swift as “childless cat ladies,” asserting that in the eyes of powerful men, “a woman without children is seen as suspicious.”
Lisa Miquet wants to reclaim this so-called insult and turn it into a manifesto by dismantling this myth, piece by piece, and shine a new light on the so-called “crazy cat lady.” She is not a desperate relic — she is the queen of her own kingdom, a peaceful soul moving freely beyond the constraints imposed upon her. Rather than merely responding to a stereotype, Miquet aspires to create a visual manifesto. A poem in images. A celebration of feminine individuality, far from social expectations.
Here, every woman is sovereign, in harmony with her own rhythm. She listens to the whisper of felines who, like her, follow their own path — untamed. Miquet believe images have the power to transform our imagination. That’s why Miquet wants to challenge this representation and offer it a new light. After all, what if being a “childless cat lady” was a choice — a life of independence, love, and freedom?
