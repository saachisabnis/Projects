Selena Gomez is healthy and happy in her romance withÂ record producer Benny Blanco -- and she's explaining how her life and mental health has changed since her youth.
The singer and Only Murders in the Building star took to TikTok over the weekend to respond to a post made by a fan who shared a video of Gomez when she was younger, and captioned it, "I know and so do you that at the time she would never have gotten engaged to Benny, she was in her IT GIRL era."
On Sunday, Gomez commented on the TikTok -- which was posted on June 3 -- and wrote, "Kinda makes me laugh because I was so depressed back then lol."
Gomez and Blanco --Â who began their relationshipÂ as collaborators and friends --Â Â confirmed their relationship in December 2023. Since, the pair have been vocal about sharing bits and pieces about their romance.Â 
Last Wednesday, GomezÂ took to Instagram to share a series of sweet photos and a message to her boyfriend. "Thank you for sharing your life with me today and everyday ðŸ™‚," the 32-year-old wrote.Â 
Gomez's carousel included a series of pictures of her and the music producer cuddled up on the couch, sharing kisses at dinners, posing for selfies and relaxing in the sun. Blanco saw the message and had a sweet reaction of three heart eye emojis.Â 
Gomez's post comes after Blanco, 36,Â penned a sweet tribute to his love in honor of her 32nd birthdayÂ earlier this month.
"i used to play a teddy bear in ur music video and now i get to b urs in real lifeâ€¦ happy bday bb ! i love u !," he wrote.Â 
The carousel led with a picture of Blanco dressed in a gigantic teddy bear suit from the "I Can't Get Enough" music video. Blanco's post continued with a picture of Gomez holding onto a smaller white teddy bear.Â 
In May, GomezÂ opened up toÂ TimeÂ magazine about loving Blanco through the noise. Though she didn't say if marriage or kids are in the immediate stars for her, she did share that he is here to stay.
"I know what people can do to people I love. My own fans, who I adore and feel like have shaped who I am, will say the most hurtful things to me about how I live my life," she told the magazine. "But he has the strength in him that none of that noise fazes him. It's really impressive, and I just cherish every moment with him. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that he's not going anywhere any time soon."
