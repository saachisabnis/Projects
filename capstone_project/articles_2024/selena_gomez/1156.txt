Selena Gomez revealed during an interview on Friday that her favorite Taylor Swift song is ‘Wildest Dreams,’ saying: “I think this is one of her, if not, I mean I guess I shouldn’t say this, but I do think it’s one of her best songs.” She said the track, which comes from Swift’s 2014 album 1989, is “incredibly well done” all-around. “The lyrics, everything,” Gomez said. “Just the melodies, it’s one of my favorites that no matter when it comes on, I will just blast it in any mood I’m in.” Gomez also had good things to say about Ariana Grande. “I cannot do anything fun without listening to Ariana,” she gushed. “I feel so empowered, and I think she’s incredible and I just have so much fun, so I’m the girl that’s playing Ariana all the time and I think people kind of notice that, but I love it. I think she’s amazing.”
