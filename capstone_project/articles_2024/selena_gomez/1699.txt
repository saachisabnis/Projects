Meryl Streep is returning to The Arconia.

	The three-time Oscar winner has closed a deal to return for the fourth season of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building.


	Streep will again recur and reprise her role as Loretta Durkin, the love interest to Short’s Oliver Putnam. Season three ended (spoiler alert) with Loretta getting an offer to work in Los Angeles.

	As previously announced, season four of the comedy starring Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez will begin with a trip to L.A. before the central action returns to its central location, The Arconia.

	










	In an interview with TV’s Top 5 coming Friday, 20th Television president Karey Burke — whose studio produces OMITB — confirmed Streep’s return. “Meryl is returning for next season because she had a tremendous time,” Burke says in The Hollywood Reporter’s podcast.

	Streep joins Molly Shannon with recurring roles in season four of OMITB, which is co-created by John Hoffman and Steve Martin. Dan Fogelman (This Is Us), Short, Gomez and Jess Rosenthal also exec produce.
