Gomez shared the trailer on her Instagram. In the post's caption, she revealed that the film would be distributed by Netflix and that it would be available on the streamer this November. It will also be available in select theaters. "Emilia Perez," she wrote in the caption. "In French theaters August 21. In select theaters this Fall and on Netflix November 13 in the US and UK." 
The trailer seems to focus on the character of Rita, played by Zoe Saldaña. She is a lawyer who gets recruited by a renowned drug dealer seeking gender-affirming surgery. While there appear to be some violent scenes, there are also plenty of musical moments, making the film into an innovative project that's tough to categorize.

The film won the Cannes Jury Prize for its director, Jacques Audiard. The film's lead stars, Saldaña, Gomez, Karla Gascon, and Adriana Paz were collectively awarded the Best Performance by an Actress award.
