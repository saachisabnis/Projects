Madonna is mending her broken heart with cake. 
After Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election, the “Vogue” hitmaker took to her Instagram Story Thursday to show off her “f–k Trump” cake. 
“Stuffed my face with this cake last night!” she penned atop the snapshot. 
The circular sweet treat was decorated with orange, yellow and brown buttercream as well as maraschino cherries. 
In her next slide, Madonna, 66, vented about the election results. 
“Trying to get my head around why a convicted felon, rapist, bigot was chosen to lead our country because he’s good for the economy?” she wrote over a selfie. 
The seven-time Grammy winner endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris last Thursday while sharing a carousel of snapshots from her trip to Paris.
“Paris was so FUN! 🇫🇷 . It was hard to leave, but I had. to come home.to V.O.T.E. 🇺🇸🇺🇸 @kamalaharris For. President!!!! ♥️,” she captioned her post.
The “Material Girl” songstress also endorsed Harris, 60, ahead of the 2020 election when she ran for vice president alongside President Joe Biden. 
“Kamilla [sic] is an intelligent, compassionate, well spoken leader who stands for justice and equal rights for all people,” she wrote at the time in a since-deleted post, according to Billboard. 
Madonna joined a long list of female singers who endorsed Harris for president this year, including Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Nicks and Cardi B.
She is also one of several celebrities who expressed dismay over Trump’s win.
“Please unfollow me if you voted against female right,” actress Christina Applegate tweeted Wednesday morning. 
“Against disability rights. Yeah that. Unfollow me because what you did is unreal. Don’t want followers like this. So yeah. Done.”
“Great job giving the MAGA gang more power, America,” “One Tree Hill” star Sophia Bush wrote on X. “My heart is broken.”
Selena Gomez shared her reaction on her Instagram Story, writing, “My heart is heavy.”
Meanwhile, celebrities who endorsed President-elect Donald Trump include Joe Rogan, Caitlyn Jenner and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul. 
Harris conceded the US presidency to Donald Trump on Wednesday.
She also said she called Trump, 78, privately to congratulate him and confirm that the current administration “will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.”
