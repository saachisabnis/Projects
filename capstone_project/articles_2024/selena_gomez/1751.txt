Selena Gomez knows what she wants — in a man, and in her engagement ring.
Gomez, 32, took to Instagram on Wednesday, December 11, to show off the gleaming engagement ring Benny Blanco gave her while popping the question. The boulder of a diamond was cut in a marquise shape and set on a gold band adorned with more sparklers.
Jared Jewelers expert and VP of Merchandising Ann Grimmett told Us Weekly the main diamond is estimated to be six carats and worth $225,000.
Grimmett also noted to Us that Gomez’s ring is extremely “rare, given less than five percent of diamonds are marquise.”
The elongated diamond dates back to the 18th century when King Louis XV of Paris instructed his jeweler to design a diamond that was in the shape of his mistress’ lips.
After Gomez flaunted her ring, fans were quick to connect the marquise shape to her 2015 hit “Good For You,” in which she sang about the cut, making Us wonder if Blanco took inspiration from her lyrics while shopping for rings.
“I’m on my marquise diamonds / I’m a marquise diamond,” she sang. “Could even make that Tiffany jealous.”
The singer also shared an adorable selfie of her beaming with joy while holding up her hand to the camera. She let the ring speak for itself, donning nude nail polish.
“Forever begins now,” Gomez captioned the post.

Celebrity friends were quick to share their excitement with Gomez in the comments section of her post.
“Yes I will be the flower girl,” BFF Taylor Swift wrote, as Nina Dobrev, who also recently got engaged to Shaun White, added, “YES !!!! Congratulations!!!!! So happy for you both!!!!” Other stars including Jennifer Aniston, Cardi B, Lily Collins, Ashley Benson, Gordon Ramsay, Suki Waterhouse and more congratulated her.
Gomez and Blanco go back to 2015 when they met while working on some of her top hits, “Kill ‘Em With Kindness” and “Same Old Love.” They sparked dating rumors nearly a decade later, in July 2023, while posing together at her 31st birthday party. In December, Gomez confirmed her relationship via social media and made their first public experience as a couple one month later.
