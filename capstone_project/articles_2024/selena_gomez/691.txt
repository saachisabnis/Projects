The trailer features Saldaña as a lawyer who will help a cartel leader in his plans to leave behind his life for the sake of fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming a woman. The film is scheduled to make its debut on November 13 in the US and in the UK, exclusively on Netflix. Before this, it is slated to arrive in theaters in France on August 21. 
Emilia Perez is written and directed by Jacques Audiard, who’s best known for his work on 2009’s A Prophet, 2012’s Rust and Bone, and 2018’s The Sisters Brothers. In addition to Saldaña, the cast will also include Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, Édgar Ramírez, Mark Ivanir and more. 
“It follows the story of Rita (Saldaña), an overqualified and undervalued lawyer at a large firm that is more interested in getting criminals off the hook than bringing them to justice,” reads the synopsis. “One day, she is given an unexpected way out, when cartel leader Manitas (Gascón) hires her to help him withdraw from his business and realize a plan he has been secretly preparing for years: to become the woman he has always dreamt of being.”
