Tina Knowles is sharing her parenting tips after raising music stars Beyoncé and Solange. 
On Tuesday (October 8), Knowles shared her parenting knowledge at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards at The Times Square EDITION in New York City. Knowles was honored at the awards alongside other mothers who have raised this generation's stars. 
When it comes to parenting, Knowles believes "you get what you put in."
"I feel like the teenage years are the most difficult, but it will get better and you get what you put in," she told PEOPLE on the Glamour red carpet. "That's what I truly believe. The more you put into your kids, the more love and care and support you give them, the more you get out of it."
Bey and her former Destiny's Child groupmate Kelly Rowland attended Tuesday's event in support of Knowles. 
As she accepted her honor, Knowles gave further insight into her life as a mother. 
"I've been so blessed in my life to do many things. I've had many careers, but I've always said that the best job that I've ever had is being a mother," Knowles. "I've had the privilege of raising and helping to raise four daughters... two that were born to me and two that were a gift to me from God. You know, I was somewhat of a rebellious teen and a young adult, and I didn't always follow the rules, but the day that I became a mother, I decided that this was one thing that I wouldn't screw up."
On Tuesday, Travis Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce, 71, Billie Elish’s mother Maggie Baird, 65, and Selena Gomez’s mother Mandy Teefey, 48, were also honored at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards.
