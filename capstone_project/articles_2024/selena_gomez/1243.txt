That makes no sense. Bassett won both CC & GG and didn’t win either SAG or BAFTA. HFPA & CCA can do whatever they want but industry will always have the last word and Grande isn’t winning any top industry award whether you like it or not. The nomination will be her prize. 
Grande could easily win SAG tho
EGOT & Triple Crown of Acting winner, VIOLA DAVIS
2-time Oscar winner, EMMA STONE
Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK
Oscar & Emmy nominee, SEBASTIAN STAN
So could everybody else.

Felicity Jones winning SAG?  I don’t even think she’s a lock to get nominated there.
SAG could literally be Saldaña, Grande, Gomez, Deadwyler (she probably gets in here but misses Oscar) and someone else.
Because SAG is “populist”? No. They are snobby at the end of the day and careful with their picks. SAG winner takes Oscar and it’ll be either Zoë or Felicity. Grande will be happy to be nominated across all ceremonies.
I hope so, but they already know who they’re voting for.

Variety final predictions for the Golden Globes :
Supporting Actress
Danielle Deadwyler, “The Piano Lesson” (Netflix)
Selena Gomez. “Emilia Pérez” (Netflix)
Ariana Grande, “Wicked” (Universal Pictures)
Saoirse Ronan, “Blitz” (Apple Original Films)
Isabella Rossellini, “Conclave” (Focus Features)
Zoe Saldaña, “Emilia Pérez” (Netflix)
Alternate: Jennifer Lopez, “Unstoppable”
I don’t trust Clayton but since GG are now owned by Penske Media, he must have an idea about who’s getting a nom no?
 So Zoe is winning. There’s no way the Academy will give Ariana a win so easily in her first major role, which isn’t even baity to begin with, is a movie that is also not a typical Oscar movie. It doesn’t matter if she delivered the performance of the century, they’re too biased for that. A nomination is the win. 
Not even a nomination, S.Actress category is already busy with stellar performances.
Let's see who's 2026 ingénue Oscars pundits will root for.
Because SAG is “populist”? No. They are snobby at the end of the day and careful with their picks. SAG winner takes Oscar and it’ll be either Zoë or Felicity. Grande will be happy to be nominated across all ceremonies.
snobby? SAG has the most basic taste of all precursors by far.
EGOT & Triple Crown of Acting winner, VIOLA DAVIS
2-time Oscar winner, EMMA STONE
Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK
Oscar & Emmy nominee, SEBASTIAN STAN
Oscar winner voting ends on Feb 18th
SAG ceremony will take place on Feb 23rd
So SAG results will probably mean very little this season.
Zoe really seems like a SAG winner to me, the actors are loving Emilia Perez.

Clayton’s reasoning is “Golden Globes loves stars”, he would definitely put Gaga there if he could. I don’t think he knows anything, he just hopes this is what happens because these are his faves. I really can’t see Blitz getting anything at this point and of course he would ignore Felicity, he is acting like she is not even in contention. I’m pretty sure she won’t get on Critics Choice because the pundits that vote there are really trying to write her off 💀
