Real estate investment trust Simon is launching a national advertising campaign aimed at bringing new generations to its shopping malls. 
The marketing effort, called “Meet Me @themall,” blends 1980s and 1990s nostalgia with a new generation “who wants to shop, eat, stay and play at the mall as much as their parents do,” according to a company statement. 
The campaign, which highlights “the enduring generational relevance of the mall,” is now being shown on streaming services such as Netflix, Peacock, Hulu and Disney +, as well as on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Simon’s owned channels and in its shopping centers throughout the country.  



“The mall is a touchstone of the American cultural experience – one with remarkable staying power,” Lee Sterling, Simon’s chief marketing officer, said in the statement. “Celebrating the spirit of meetups in the food court, memories made with friends and coming-of-age moments, this new campaign is Simon’s invitation for everyone to gather in a place that has always brought joy, community and memorable experiences.” 
Indianapolis-based Simon, which owns and operates three mall properties on Long Island, including Roosevelt Field in Garden City, Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove and Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, points out that about 97% of Gen Z survey respondents said they shop at brick-and-mortar stores, according to a 2023 report by the International Council of Shopping Centers. 
More than 250 talent, creators and influencers are partnering with Simon on the campaign, including Alejandro Rosario, The Pitman Sisters, Gym Tan, Mya Miller, Preshous Jordan and Dan Pelosi, among others.  



“While Gen Zers may find their moms cringey, it turns out that they have developed a love for many of the same things their parents did: from fashion to movies to music and the mall,” Sterling said in the statement. “At Simon, we are all about bringing multiple generations together to seek new connections, have fun and make shared memories along the way. While the mall experience has evolved over the years, it continues to capture the zeitgeist of each generation.” 
The Simon spots were created in partnership with SuperBloom House and directed by Matty Peacock, the director known for his collaborations with Billie Eilish, Cardi B, Selena Gomez, The 1975, One Republic and Demi Lovato. Simon also has launched @themall social channels on TikTok and Instagram that aim to celebrate mall culture and fandom, while highlighting the diverse experiences and offerings at Simon malls.
