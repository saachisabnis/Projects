Selena Gomez is making history at the 2025 Golden Globes. The Hollywood star, who recently shared her emotional reaction to the nominations, showed her support for her 'Emilia Perez' co-star Zoe Saldaña and her longtime friend Ariana Grande.
The singer and businesswoman is being recognized for her acting skills in both film and television, earning nominations for her role in 'Emilia Perez' and for her performance in the fan-favorite series 'Only Murders in The Building.'
Selena has become the second Latina to be nominated for film and television projects in the same year after 35 years. Raquel Welch was the first Latina to receive nominations for both in 1989, for her role in 'Right to Die' in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture and Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television.
"I don't even know what to write. I'm so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes," Selena wrote after learning the news. Another actor nominated for film and television this year is Sebastian Stan, who earned recognition for his role in 'Pam & Tommy' and for his performances in 'A Different Man' and in the Donald Trump biopic 'The Apprentice.' 
"I think if anything, it made me pay attention to a lot of things that I think I lacked growing up. And it was that connection. I started working when I was seven, and most of my job has been in English," Selena said during an exclusive interview with HOLA!
"This was really necessary for me to do and to get in touch with, and I hope that this isn't the last thing that I do in Spanish. I would love to take care of that and nurture that side of me more," she added.
