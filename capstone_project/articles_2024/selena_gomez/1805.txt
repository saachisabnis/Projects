More than a week after getting engaged to Benny Blanco, Selena Gomez is still over the moon about her gorgeous diamond ring.
The Rare Beauty founder shared even more photos of her dazzling engagement ring on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (December 19), joking that she was "sorry" for snapping so many pics of the sparkling jewelry but that she was simply so excited because "I've just dreamed of this moment my whole life," per People, which shared photos of the since-expired snaps.
In one clip, an excited Gomez held up her hand in the sunlight for a better look at the marquise-shaped diamond set on a diamond eternity band, also showing off her simple yet elegant manicure, while the second photo featured a smiling Gomez taking a selfie with the ring on full display.
The "Love On" singer announced December 11 that she and the music producer got engaged, around one year after first confirming their romance in a heartfelt post where she said Blanco was "my absolute everything in my heart."
"Forever begins now.." she captioned the announcement on Instagram, sharing the first look at her ring alongside photos of her looking ecstatic and cuddling with her new fianc√©.
Blanco himself is still having a hard time believing and his love are getting ready to walk down the aisle. He also recently shared an inside look into his romantic proposal with some behind-the-scenes videos.
