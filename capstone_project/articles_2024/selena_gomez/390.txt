With The Acolyte concluded, it’s honestly a pretty light month on Disney+. But if you also subscribe to Hulu, you’re getting the return of one of their best shows: Only Murders in the Building starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, as the trio of amateur sleuths turned podcast hosts. On this season, their podcast gets adapted into a movie, and the star-studded cast of guest stars will include Eva Longoria, Eugene Levy, Zach Galifianakis, Kumail Nanjiani, Melissa McCarthy, and Molly Shannon.
Also coming on Disney+ and Hulu in August: new episodes of Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures and Spidey and His Amazing Friends for the little ones, plus the streaming premieres of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Immaculate, and a whole streaming documentary series on Baywatch.
