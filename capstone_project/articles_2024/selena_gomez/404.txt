Drama Baby Reindeer won big at last nightâ€™s Emmy Awards.
The Netflix show about a bi man and a flirtation that turns into a nightmare experience with a stalker took a raft of titles. Writer/star Richard Gadd took a pair of trophies for best writer and for actor in a limited series, and his co-star Jessica Gunning for supporting actress in a limited series. Nava Mau and Tom Goodman-Hill also made shortlists for their roles in the programme.
Meanwhile Hacks took the lead actress in a comedy series prize for Jean Smart. Elsewhere What We Do In The Shadows was acknowledged in three categories albeit without taking any prizes.
Only Murders In The Building missed out on the prize for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series (Paul Rudd), however all three central characters (Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez) were shortlisted for best lead actor/ess in a comedy series. Meryl Streep also made a shortlist (supporting actress in a comedy series) for that show which is currently in its fourth season.
Smash-hit TV adaptation of the game Werewolf, Traitors, also took an award which was picked up by US lead Alan Cumming.
