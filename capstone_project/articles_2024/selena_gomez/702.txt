The 75th Emmy Awards ceremony may have happened four months later than originally planned due to the actors’ and writers’s strikes, but the stars made up for lost time by going the extra mile to look smart on the red carpet Monday night. There was a virtual rainbow of colors and styles on display from candy apple red worn by “Succession” star Sarah Snook to bubblegum pink sported by Claire Danes and Quinta Brunson. Daniel Radcliffe looked regal in burgundy while Sheryl Lee Ralph showed that even white can make a stunning fashion statement.
