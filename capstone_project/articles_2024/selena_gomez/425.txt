Did Selena Gomez say "I love you" to beau Benny Blanco first, or was it the other way around? 
The pair recently filmed a TikTok video where they revealed who was "most likely to" in the relationship, highlighting the exact moment those three special words were first shared. 
The first question was who was most likely to "fall asleep during a movie," to which the couple agreed that it would be both of them. As the video proceeds, viewers discover that both are first to apologize during an argument, be romantic, spend a similar amount of money, and would never forget that it is Valentine's Day. Blanco took first place for being the big spoon, eating the most, taking the longest to get ready, and for being the one to clean the house. 
Towards the end of the clip, the Wizards of Waverly Place alum revealed (with a smile) that she was actually the first to say "I love you" in the relationship.
The pair sparked dating rumors while working together on Gomez' "Single Soon" hit last summer, and publicly announced their relationship in December 2023. The lovebirds have since shared a handful adorable posts depicting a happy life together in and out of the spotlight and supporting each other through thick and thin.
