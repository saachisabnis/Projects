First things first: There’s an exceedingly rare Reformation sale going on right this minute. If you’re serious about snagging the best deals—and trust, there are many, with discounts of up to 30% on fall wedding guest dresses, trendy loafers, and autumnal jackets—scroll down and start adding to your cart ASAP.
Reformation’s A-list fans are legion; style icons like Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston have recently been spotted in its sweaters and dresses. But its biggest celebrity supporter might just be Taylor Swift, who frequently steps out in the label’s tops, pants, loafers, and sweaterdresses (many of which are on sale right now). Ref is so popular that it basically doesn’t offer discounts—but the Reformation sale is a rare exception. Whether you’re putting together your fall capsule wardrobe or enjoying every last minute of summer, our edit of the brand’s best markdowns has you covered.
Need a simple black dress for any occasion? A bubble dress to buy into the growing trend? A puff-sleeve pick in one of fall’s most popular shades? Reformation is here to help—but since sizes are selling out rapidly, we suggest you act fast. Oh, and the Frankie dress, a perennial favorite among Glamour readers, is also on sale in a select few colors, including wedding-friendly lavender.

Ref sweaters have earned a cult following for their eye-catching designs and supersoft materials. One can never have too many creamy knits on hand for fall and winter—and considering cashmere rarely goes on sale, we suggest snapping these up before they disappear for good. Of note: Selena Gomez wore that exact turtleneck sweater last year.

Long denim skirts are some of the moment’s most popular, and therefore highest priced, items of the moment, but Reformation apparently didn’t get the memo—two of its trendiest skirts are 30% off as we speak, although select sizes and colors are beginning to vanish. And consider this your chance to stock up on jeans both trendy (wide-leg denim) and classic (straight jeans) at a great price.

Taylor Swift owns Ref’s Rosaline top, which is now under $70 and still barely in stock. (You can get a similar look from the long-sleeve Valentina top, by the way.) Meanwhile, two cute fall-friendly pieces—a button-down shirt and a sailor-inspired bow top—will round out your autumn rotation paired with vintage denim and tailored trousers.

Multiple Glamour editors own and love Reformation’s Bethany ballet flats, which feature an on-trend Mary Jane strap and oversized hardware. (We’re also obsessed with those Chanel-esque tweed flats, which will be so versatile going into fall.) Taylor Swift, meanwhile, loves the brand’s Agathea loafers, which are still available on sale in a few select sizes. Round out your footwear collection with kitten heels that’ll look great with slinky sweaterdresses.

After seeing the discounts on these fall jackets and winter coats, we’re almost too stunned to speak—almost. Somehow a few of the most perfect topcoats and blazers we’ve seen in a minute are much cheaper than usual, even with colder weather looming. Don’t question it; just grab anything warm in your size.
