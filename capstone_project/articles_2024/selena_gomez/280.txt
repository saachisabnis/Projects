Oppenheimer has continued its successful awards season run as its secured a Writers Guild Awards nomination.
British director Christopher Nolan’s epic biopic, which sees Irish star Cillian Murphy play J Robert Oppenheimer – the theoretical physicist described as the father of the atomic bomb, earned a nod in the adapted screenplay category.
It comes after Oppenheimer earned seven Bafta awards on Sunday, including best film and best director, as well as landing 13 Oscar nominations.
The nominations follow after Writers Guild of America (WGA) workers ended strike action in September, as the union agreed to a deal with studio bosses after 146 days on the picket line.
