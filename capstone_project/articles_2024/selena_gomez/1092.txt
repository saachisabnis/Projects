Zoe SaldaÃ±a has been busy promoting her new movie Emilia PÃ©rez amid a ton of much-deserved Oscar buzz. The film also stars Selena Gomez and is a French musical crime drama that tells the story of a Mexican lawyer who helps a notorious cartel boss retire and privately transition into living as a woman. It sounds like a lot, but it's definitely a must-see. And luckily you can do just that, as it is streaming now on Netflix.
Know what else is a must-see? The actress' style in recent weeks. From green ruched mini dresses and strapless leather jumpsuits to head-to-toe tailoring in androgynous chic, she has been doing it all. And her latest look might just be her best yet.
In the midst of being out and about, Zoe attended the Elle Women in Hollywood event on Tuesday 19 November looking incredible. She STUNS, if you will.
The actress arrived on the red â€“ make that black, trÃ¨s chic â€“ carpet wearing a Schiaparelli design that is best described as equal parts chic, equal parts seriously cool. The denim (!!) dress featured a scooped halter neck, corseted bodice with exposed seaming and patch pockets Ã  la a pair of jeans sewn at either hip. Our favourite detail however, was the zippered fastening that ran down the entire front of the design, with Zoe unzipping it to the mid-thigh to create a central leg slit.
She wore gold strappy sandals on her feet to tie in with the gold zip and paired the look with a berry lip and burgundy nails, plus some statement pearl and gold earrings for good measure. I mean. Beyond.
