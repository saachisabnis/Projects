Fans are divided about People’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2024: Actor John Krasinski. 
Every year People magazine shares its verdict on who Hollywood’s sexiest man alive is, with a star-studded and dashingly handsome past line-up. Mel Gibson kicked off the annual tradition in 1985.
Since then recipients of the honour include Grey’s Anatomy actor Patrick Dempsey, film star Michael B. Jordan, singer Adam Levine and British icon Jude Law, to name just a few. 
It was announced overnight that John Krasinski, who first rose to fame in the American version of The Office, is this year’s recipient. 
John, 45, is also known as the creator and star of A Quiet Place films – which he acts in alongside his wife Emily Blunt, 41 – as well as for playing the titular character in the hit Amazon Prime show Jack Ryan. 
When asked about his reaction to the news, John told People: ‘Just immediate blackout, actually. Zero thoughts. Other than maybe I’m being punked. That’s not how I wake up, thinking, “Is this the day that I’ll be asked to be Sexiest Man Alive?” And yet it was the day you guys did it. You guys have really raised the bar for me.’
Emily and John live in Brooklyn, New York with their daughters Hazel, 10, and Violet, 8.
While some fans think John is worthy of the honour, others aren’t so sure. 
@jps_aririah wrote on X: ‘This is the most average looking man I’ve ever seen.’
@Ike_Nano posted: ‘Mind you he’s hideous 😭’
@positionsmafiaa agreed: ‘Who is picking these men we need to chat.’
@buffys also chimed in: ‘They could’ve chosen someone better not gonna lie.’
@beyoncegarden even accused the magazine of intentionally making controversial choices, writing: ‘I think they purposely choose people who aren’t the sexiest man alive to drive up clicks bc😭…’
But some fans are on board with the choice, with @ZaayraBakhsh writing:‘He’s so handsome.’
@Aam7860 agreed: ‘Krasinski’s charm and humor make him the perfect Sexiest Man Alive. He’s relatable and down-to-earth!’
Another user mentioned the controversy that exploded a few days ago, when fans mistakenly believed record producer Benny Blanco had been named as the sexiest man alive. @SerAemond wrote: ‘Y’all complaining when it could’ve been Benny Blanco.’
As the countdown for 2024’s reveal drew to a close over the last few days, People gave fans a ‘jumpscare’ after sharing that Benny (who has been dating Selena Gomez for over a year) would feature in the issue.
The 36-year-old mega-producer – behind hit tunes such as Ed Sheeran’s Perfect and Justin Bieber’s Love Yourself – is not the ideal candidate for this year’s winner,according to fan who were vying for stars such as Manny Jacinto, Glen Powell, and Adam Brody.
‘If people named Benny Blanco as one of the sexiest men alive. I’m scared who they’re going to announce for the official sexiest man alive tomorrow,’ @heartlessreader wrote on X. 
‘I think People magazine has been running an elaborate long running joke on us for all these years and this is the first time where it was too obvious,’ @houseofphoton added. 
‘The jumpscare I had thinking Benny Blanco was the OFFICIAL sexiest man alive,’ @fireheart5_15 shared.
‘Benny Blanco and sexiest man alive should never be in the same sentence,’ @orseunid declared.
‘The rage and confusion that just went through my body when I thought Benny Blanco was being announced sexiest man alive… I’m gonna need a minute,’ @pastureangel said. 
‘Benny Blanco is People’s sexiest man alive ??? Y’all I need 2024 to be over right now,’ @ayah2156 posted. 
‘Wdym Benny Blanco as the sexiest man alive????’ @may_samosa shared. 
‘Trump won presidency … Benny Blanco is the so called sexiest man alive… I woke up in the wrong timeline,’ @sortaprettycoolechoed.
‘I thought Trump’s presidency was bad. We have truly lost it as a society,’ @theafrocentricI agreed.
Although not everyone was quite so harsh, with @_jonathan_ahern writing: ‘Good for him.’
And @waselpti echoed: ‘Can’t argue with that choice! He’s got the talent and the charm to match.’
‘Well-deserved spotlight!’ @jhakasjaffa agreed.
And, of course, we can’t forget his biggest supporter – Selena herself. She took to her Instagram story with a repost of one of the magazine photos with the caption: ‘Not only do you love me unconditionally, you always get me my Taco Bell Mexican pizza.’
She then added a second post with a quote from William C. Hannan which reads: ‘I still haven’t figured out how to sit across from you, and not be madly in love with everything you do.’
Whichever side you land on, everyone can calm down as Benny has not secured the coveted title, which is yet to be announced.
He did, however, speak with People for a insightful profile about his ‘life and love’ as part of the Sexiest Man Alive issue.
During the interview he waxed lyrical about the love he has for pop star girlfriend Selena. 
‘I’m a real morning person. It’s my favorite time to spend with Sel, because we both wake up really early. It’s like our moment before the rest of the world wakes up.
‘I have a true best friend that I get to do everything in the world with, and every day is the best day of my life,’ the songwriter said.
At another point he reminisced on the Same Old Love hitmaker renting out a botanical garden for date.
And his Valentines Day gift was heavily food-themed, including: ‘Taco Bell, I made her movie-theatre nachos, I found her favourite pickles from Texas and I deep-fried them for her.’
Elsewhere, last year’s winner Patrick, 58, reflected on his shock at being awarded the sought-after title. 
‘I was completely shocked, and then I started laughing, like, this is a joke, right? I’ve always been the bridesmaid!” he said at the time.
‘I’d completely forgotten about it and never even contemplated being in this position. So my ego is good.’
The father-of-three also joked about how his children would react to the news, saying: ‘[They’re] just going to make fun of me and pick on me and figure out every reason why I shouldn’t be. Which is good, they keep me young.’
People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive 2024 issue is out now.
