Selena Gomez has revealed exactly what cosmetic procedures she’s had done, amid pressure on TikTok to do so. It all started when fans asked Marissa Barrionuevo, a physician’s assistant at a plastic surgery office, to speculate on Gomez. Barrionuevo has garnered a significant social media following for speculating on celebrities’ changing faces.

“I literally have no idea what she’s gotten done, and I think she’s been through so much in her life, especially medically related,” Barrionuevo said about Gomez in a video from November 2023, referencing the Emmy nominee’s health battles with lupus.

“I don’t think it’s fair to speculate whether or not she’s gotten cosmetic things done. I don’t know what to attribute any of these changes to. When it comes to botox and filler, I do these things when I’m pretty confident I know what someone has gotten done, but when it comes to Selena, I literally have no idea what to attribute.”
In a rare response to social media pressure, Gomez took to the comments section, writing: “Honestly I hate this. I was on stripes because of a flare-up. I have Botox. That’s it. Leave me alone.” While we’re not 100% sure what “stripes” means in this context, it may be a reference to steroid medication, which is commonly used to treat lupus and can cause facial swelling and an altered appearance. 
“I totally understand you still not appreciating it, and I’m not sure if this was a response to me, or to just the comment section, or the whole thing,” Barrionuevo said in a follow-up post shared on July 28, 2024. “I think it was probably just the whole thing,” she added. “You don’t owe it to anyone to tell us why you don’t look the same as you did when you were a teenager, or in your 20s… I am sorry if that made you feel any sort of way. I adore you.”
Indeed, in 2019, Gomez took a break from social media amid mounting online bullying centered on her appearance. “I experienced [body-shaming] with my weight fluctuation for the first time,” she told MTV News at the time. “I have lupus and deal with kidney issues and high blood pressure, so I deal with a lot of health issues, and for me, that’s when I really started noticing more of the body-image stuff.”
