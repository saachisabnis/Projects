Being a celebrity means capturing attention, but it can also draw in people claiming to be a celeb's friend but who really just want to use the fame for their own gain. Selena Gomez is getting around that by having close friendships with "levelheaded people" who couldn't care less about her level of success.
The "Love On" singer made the revelation during a recent interview with Time, claiming her closest friends include a casting director, a real estate agent and a producer, per Page Six. She added that she doesn't know where she even fits in with the "cool girls."
"It's a cliché, but girls are mean," she said. "It's a very weird competition, being in the cool girls area — and then I'm just kind of like, there. I don't know where I'm meant to belong."
As for her group of friends, Gomez tends to surround herself with people who don't care about her fame, whether it's her celebrated roles as an actress, her long music career or her successful beauty brand. 
"I love having levelheaded people around that couldn't give two f---s about what I do," she said.
Despite having a circle of close friends, she still deals with loneliness and the "hard" effort of going through it.
"You could be in a crowd of people and still feel alone. I still deal with that," she said, adding, "You can distract yourself and say you can deny and deny all you want, but it'll still be there. I just allow myself to have those days."
Elsewhere in the interview, Gomez spoke about her previous decision to adopt children as a single mother when she reached a certain age after not being in a relationship for years; however, it's unclear if her plans have changed since sparking her romance with boyfriend Benny Blanco.
