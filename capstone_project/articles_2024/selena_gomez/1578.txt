Dan Benson is not happy about being blocked on Instagram by former Wizards of Waverly Place costar David Henrie. 
Benson, 37, posted a video via Instagram on Tuesday, October 29, that shaded Henrie, 35, for blocking him on X. The clip featured a photo of Benson fake-crying over a screenshot of a message from X that read: “@DavidHenrie blocked you,” alerting Benson that he could no longer follow Henrie or view his posts.
“We pretended to be best friends for years. How could you do this to me??” he captioned the post.
Benson and Henrie’s beef began after Henrie participated in a recent BuzzFeed game with the young actors from the new Wizards of Waverly Place reboot. They were asked to choose which original cast member should return as a guest star on the show and the list included Benson, who played Zeke Beakerman opposite Henrie’s Justin Russo.
While looking at BuzzFeed’s list of potential guest stars, Henrie quipped, “I can’t believe you put one of these people on here. Millennials understand that.”
Laughter filled the room as he mentioned the name of Benson’s character. While Henrie’s joke wasn’t explained, the Disney star was likely referencing the fact that Benson currently works in adult entertainment and is a creator on OnlyFans.

As the moment circulated on X, Benson offered a response in the comments section, writing, “David Henrie can suck my dick. I’ll pay him more than they paid me for Wizards I promise you that.”
Henrie apparently decided to block Benson after viewing that post. 
Last year, Benson posted a TikTok video explaining his decision to pivot from acting to OnlyFans in 2022. 
“One of the questions I get asked all the time is, ‘What? Huh? What do you mean? No. How?'” he said in January 2023. “So anyway, I thought I’d take just a minute to explain how I kind of tripped and fell into adult entertainment.”
He continued, “I would get messages from people all of the time, some of those being women that I found incredibly attractive. It turns out, messaging those women, who turned out not to be who they said they were, turned out to be not the best idea.”
By that, he meant that these women had shared nude photos and videos of him online.

“That was a pretty traumatic experience, and for years I went about trying to get rid of them, get them off the internet, ’cause obviously I did not want them out there,” he said at the time. “But, as you can imagine, that was a pretty difficult task.”
He said that the experience had “a very big, negative impact on my life,” but, “Eventually, I decided to stop fighting against it and instead go the other direction and completely lean into it and build out a page. And instead of letting these people sell my privacy, my… you know what I mean, I decided to say, ‘Alright, screw you. I’m gonna sell it myself.'”
Meanwhile, the Wizards reboot, Wizards Beyond Waverly Place, premiered Tuesday, October 29, on Disney Channel.
