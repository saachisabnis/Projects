	SiriusXM announced a multiyear agreement with SmartLess Media and its three founders — Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes — encompassing exclusive advertising and distribution rights, content, events and more for their popular flagship podcast “SmartLess” and other shows produced by the company.

	SiriusXM’s deal with SmartLess Media will commence late in the summer of 2024. Terms of the pact weren’t disclosed. The three-year agreement is valued at more than $100 million over the term, according to two sources, confirming a Bloomberg report. The SmartLess trio currently have a deal with Amazon, which struck a deal in mid-2021 for exclusive distribution and ad-sales rights to “SmartLess” said to be worth up to $80 million.

	SmartLess Media describes the show hosted by Bateman, Hayes and Arnett as “a podcast that connects and unites people from all walks of life to learn about shared experiences through thoughtful dialogue and organic hilarity.” A regular feature of the podcast is that one of the hosts has invited a mystery guest, who is revealed to the other two in each episode.
