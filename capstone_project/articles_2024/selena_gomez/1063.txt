I mean, did you see the ring he got Selena?  
K, so you already know Selena Gomez is rich-rich â€” like billionaire-rich â€” but what about her new fiancÃ©, music producer Benny Blanco? In case you missed it, Sel took to Instagram to announce their engagement on 11th December, along with a photo of the engagement ring, which is worth an estimated $225,000 (*whistles*).
Obviously he does pretty well for himself to afford a nearly-quarter-of-a-million-dollar ring... but if you're curious just how much Benny (real name Benjamin Levin) is worth, we did the digging for you. (You're welcome.) Ahead, everything we know about Benny Blanco's net worth, as well as how exactly he made his moola. 
You may not realise this, but during his career as a music producer (and songwriter!), Benny helped create some of the biggest bangers of the 2010s. His credits include Rihanna's 'Diamonds,' Wiz Khalifa and Maroon 5's 'Payphone,' Kesha's 'Blow,' Taio Cruz's 'Dynamite,' Britney Spears' 'Circus,' Katy Perry's 'I Kissed a Girl,' Justin Bieber's 'Lonely,' and Selena Gomez's 'Same Old Love,' just to name a select few. Casual!
The 36-year-old has also released music under his name with artists like BTS, Halsey, Khalid, Juice WRLD, and J Balvin â€” again, just to name a few. 
In 2018, he released his debut single as a lead artist, 'Eastside,' which peaked in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 (!!), and he later released the singles 'I Found You,' 'Better to Lie,' and 'Roses,' which were all included on his debut album, Friends Keep Secrets.
Let's take a moment to appreciate his 2018 breakout hit, shall we? 
In 2014, the producer founded two imprint labels under Interscope: Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets. Some artists on the respective rosters include Ryan Beatty, Cashmere Cat, and Rixton, among others. 
Benny reportedly owns at least four properties, located in Malibu, West Hollywood, and the Hollywood Hills. One of those houses includes the former home of Tinder co-founder, Sean Rad, which Benny scooped up for nearly $9.2 million in 2020.
He also put his Chelsea condo (which he bought back in 2011) on the market for nearly $4 million back in June. 
According to Celebrity Net Worth, Benny Blanco's net worth in 2024 is $50 million, which is pretty major â€” even though it's a mere fraction of Selena's $1.3 billion net worth (sorry to bring it up again, but it's just ðŸ˜²).
