There is nothing quite like going to Target, walking aimlessly around with some coffee in hand and listening out for Target to tell you what you need. Sadly, that is no longer the case for Selena Gomez and her mom, because fame has gotten in the way of that simple pleasure.
In the Glamour 2024 Women of the Year issue, Selena's mother, Mandy Teefey, talked about not being able to go to places with her daughter any longer. She explained, "We used to go to Target and just hang out at Target and just shop and do silly things, but you can’t do that anymore."
She also added that they have to experience Disneyland differently, explaining, "You have to go in the back where all the mechanical things are, and you don’t really get to go through the park. You do miss out on that."
Teefey is featured in this particular issue alongside Tina Knowles (Beyoncé' & Solange Knowles' mom), Donna Kelce (Travis Kelce's mom), and Maggie Baird (Billie Eilish and FINNEAS' mom). Mama Tina explained that she also misses going on outings, similar to Mandy's Target runs with Selena. Knowles told Glamour, "Solange just won’t play the game. She’ll just go shopping. But obviously that’s not something that we can do with Beyoncé, and that’s what I miss. I miss us going to the grocery store, going with my kids to eat at the cafeteria. You don’t get to go to the mall anymore."
