Jamie Foxx is speaking out after an incident that happened over his birthday weekend.
The actor, 57, shared a statement via Instagram on Sunday, December 15, following an altercation at a Beverly Hills restaurant the evening prior.
Foxx posted a photo on his instagram grid, which contained white text over a black background, reading, “The devil is busy…but I’m too blessed to be stressed.” He pinned the post to the top of his profile.
“The devil is a lie,” Foxx wrote in the caption. “Can’t win here… thank you to everybody that pray and check on me… when your light is shining bright… they try to bring you darkness … but they don’t know that you’re built for it… the lights have been shining bright…”
He continued, “and huge thank yous to everyone that have watched and been inspired by ‘What Had Happened Was’ … number 1 on @netflix if you haven’t checked it out please go check it out it’s from my heart and my soul….”
Foxx was out to celebrate his 57th birthday on Saturday, December 14. “Jamie Foxx was at his birthday dinner when someone from another table threw a glass that hit him in the mouth,” Foxx’s spokesperson told Us Weekly in a statement at the time. “He had to get stitches and is recovering. The police were called and the matter is now in law enforcement’s hands.”
TMZ reported that Foxx was out at Mr. Chow, a restaurant in Beverly Hills, when the incident occurred. He was joined by his two daughters Corinne and Analise, and his ex Kristin Grannis.
According to the Beverly Hills Police Department, a call was made around 10 p.m. regarding an alleged fight at the restaurant.
“Upon investigation, officers determined that the reported assault with a deadly weapon was unfounded,” BHPD said in a press release. “Instead, the incident involved a physical altercation between parties.”
