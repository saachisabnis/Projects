While a little black dress is certainly a timeless wardrobe classic well worth investing in — it didn’t earth its moniker, the LBD, for nothing! — it’s not necessarily a statement piece. But leave it to Selena Gomez, the undisputed queen of the LBD, to defy expectations with elegant aplomb.
When the Emilia Pérez actress stepped out on Sunday, November 17, for the Governors Awards in Los Angeles — where she was joined by A-listers like Jennifer Lopez and Kerry Washington — she turned heads in a sequined black dress that glittered from every angle.
Her Ralph Lauren column, which was plucked right off the Spring 2025 runway, featured a prim and polished bright white collar and matching cuffs at the sleeves, putting a menswear-inspired twist on the unabashedly glamorous moment.
She accessorized with a major earring stack and dazzling drop earrings with a leaf-like design. Gomez, 32, added an edgy-chic twist with her glam: slicked-back, flipped-up bob that had a fresh-from-the-shower wet look.
Her nail artist, Tom Bachik, swiped on an Aprés Nail color called “Never Bordeaux You” that lent the look a dark and glamorous feel. She matched the mood with a seriously smoky eye, winged-out liner and extra-long lashes.

While on her promotional tour for the film, Gomez has turned out one little black dress after another, ranging from short and kicky sweater dresses to all-black androgynous tailoring to plunging strapless gowns.
Gomez’s stylist, Erin Walsh, recently revealed that the actress’s press tour wardrobe is defined by “powerfully feminine” head-to-toe black looks that don’t shy away from texture.
Indeed, the little black dress, particularly when worn by Gomez, is a staple that knows no limits.
