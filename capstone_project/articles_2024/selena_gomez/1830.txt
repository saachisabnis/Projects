When it comes to mastering minimalist home decor, few hold a candle to Kim Kardashian.
And while the star’s lent her name to several fragrances over the years, she’s hardly filling her home with prayer candles featuring her own face.
The Skims founder’s assistant recently told Poosh that she instead lights Diptyque Jasmin ($74) throughout her house and Roses ($74) in her bathrooms to achieve what Kourtney’s outlet describes as a “subtle and alluring” scent.
She’s far from the only star stocking up on Diptyque candles; Meghan Markle likes the brand’s Figuier ($74) and Tubereuse ($74) scents — and even burned the floral Baies ($74) during her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, according to Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand’s book “Finding Freedom.”
Meanwhile, Beyoncé keeps her home smelling like the brand’s balmy Opopanax candle ($74), once telling InStyle, “I have a lot of Diptyque candles around the house. Even when I’m away, I have someone burn them. I like having the scent in my pillows.”

Diptyque isn’t the only candle brand Poosh deemed as up to snuff, however, as the outlet also suggested several similar candles for those looking to copy Kardashian’s scent.
For a more budget-friendly option, there’s the Voluspa Jasmine Midnight Blooms candle ($34) — from a brand beloved by Bethenny Frankel and Selena Gomez — or the bestselling Boy Smells Hinoki Fantôme candle ($38).
Flamingo Estate, a brand that’s landed on Oprah’s “Favorite Things” list, also offers a luxe jasmine-scented votive: the Night Blooming Damask & Damask Rose candle ($58).
