Selena Gomez can't get enough of her boyfriend, Benny Blanco -- and she wants the world to know it! 
On Wednesday, the Only Murders in the Building star took to Instagram to share a series of sweet photos and a message to her boyfriend. 
"Thank you for sharing your life with me today and everyday 🙂," the 32-year-old wrote. 
Gomez's carousel included a series of pictures of her and the music producer cuddled up on the couch, sharing kisses at dinners, posing for selfies and relaxing in the sun. Blanco saw the message and had a sweet reaction of three heart eye emojis. 
The "Look at Her Now" singer's comments were also filled with reactions from her famous friends and fans. 
"😍😍😍," Lily Collins wrote. 
"Love FTW!," actress Amy Rosoff Davis added. 
"so precious 🥺 love yall ❤️," songstress HAVEN commented. 
Gomez's post comes after Blanco, 36, penned a sweet tribute to his love in honor of her 32nd birthday earlier this week. 
"i used to play a teddy bear in ur music video and now i get to b urs in real life… happy bday bb ! i love u !," he wrote. 
The carousel led with a picture of Blanco dressed in a gigantic teddy bear suit from the "I Can't Get Enough" music video. Blanco's post continued with a picture of Gomez holding onto a smaller white teddy bear. 
Gomez and Blanco -- who began their relationship as collaborators and friends --  confirmed their relationship in December 2023. Since, the pair have been vocal about sharing bits and pieces about their romance. 
Last week, the musical duo took to TikTok to play the "Who's Most Likely To: Couples Edition," challenge and answered questions like "Who's most likely to fall asleep during a movie?" (they both are) to "Who eats the most?" (he does).
Blanco, however, took immense pride in being "the most romantic" and the one who "cleans the house." But it was Gomez who proudly pointed to herself -- while mouthing "me" -- when it came time to reveal who said "I love you" first.
In May, Gomez opened up to Time magazine about loving Blanco through the noise. Though she didn't say if marriage or kids are in the immediate stars for her, she did share that he is here to stay.
"I know what people can do to people I love. My own fans, who I adore and feel like have shaped who I am, will say the most hurtful things to me about how I live my life," she told the magazine. "But he has the strength in him that none of that noise fazes him. It's really impressive, and I just cherish every moment with him. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that he's not going anywhere any time soon."
