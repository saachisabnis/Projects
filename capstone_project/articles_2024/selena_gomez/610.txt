There’s never any shortage of glamour when Priyanka Chopra steps onto a red carpet.
At last night’s Kering for Women dinner in New York City, the Citadel star once again delivered a breathtaking fashion statement in an outfit that embodied classic glamour—and she did so by relying on a few simple pieces.
The centerpiece of this look was a slinky black silk slipdress, complete with an alluring scalloped lace halter neck and a revealing low-back silhouette.
She took a no-fuss approach to her nighttime look, accessorizing the dress minimally via a pair of satin black slingback pumps—also by Saint Laurent—and diamond jewelry from Bulgari. (The latter is to be expected, considering Chopra’s longtime role as an ambassador for the luxury jewelry brand.) Specifically, she wore a white gold bracelet that wrapped around her wrist and twinkled with the shine of dozens of diamonds.
Chopra wasn’t the only celebrity in attendance at the Kering Foundation’s annual dinner. Other celebrities who also brought their fashion A-game to the gala included Kim Kardashian, Salma Hayek, Selena Gomez, and Dakota Johnson.
Chopra seems to have an affinity for the transparent lace trend that’s been overtaking runways and red carpets for the past year. Back in August, the actor joined husband Nick Jonas for the Los Angeles premiere of his new movie, The Good Half, where she wowed in a head-turning gold and black lace one-shoulder gown from Dolce and Gabbana. The piece was layered over a similarly transparent and black lace camisole, which Chopra wore tucked into a pair of black briefs.
