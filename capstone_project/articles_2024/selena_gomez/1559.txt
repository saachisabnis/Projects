(CNN) - Selena Gomez can now add becoming a billionaire to her long list of achievements.
According to Bloomberg, Gomez’s net worth is now $1.3 billion.
That makes the 32-year-old actress, singer, investor, and entrepreneur one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the country.
Some of Gomez’s wealth comes from singing, brand partnerships, and acting -- but the vast majority is tied to Rare Beauty -- her makeup line that is popular with influencers and teens.
Her popularity on Instagram makes her the third most followed person.
She has a whopping 424 million followers -- which helps her rake in multi-million-dollar endorsements with brands like Puma and Coach.
Other revenue streams for the former child star include her Hulu show “Only Murders in the Building” -- which was just renewed for a fifth season.
Gomez earns a reported $6 million per season.
