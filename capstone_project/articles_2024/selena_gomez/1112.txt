Meryl Streep enjoyed a night out on the town with one of her "Only Murders In The Building" co-stars in Santa Monica on Wednesday (October 16) evening, spurring romance rumors. 
According to Page Six, The Devil Wears Prada alum was getting "cozy" with actor Martin Short at celebrity favorite eatery Giorgio Baldi as rumors of a possible romance began to swirl. Photos obtained by the outlet show the 75-year-old and her co-star enjoying a meal together with smiles on their faces before driving off in Streep's car. 
The possible pair (who could just be close friends) are both featured in the popular comedy-drama series alongside Steve Martin, and Selena Gomez. Amid sharing the screen, they have been spotted laughing together at premieres and award shows, and posing closely for photos during red carpet events. 
The Mama Mia star joined the OMITB cast in season three of the show, portraying Loretta Durkin, Short's character's love interest. Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the silver screen queen would return for season four of the beloved series. 
Neither Streep, nor Short have confirmed the news of a possible budding romance as filming of OMITB season four proceeds.
