Selena Gomez is clapping back at an actor who criticized her "indefensible" Spanish in her new film Emilia Pérez.
Mexico-born actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez, known for his roles in films like The Book of Life, CODA and How to Be a Latin Lover, recently criticized the way the Rare Beauty founder delivered her lines in Spanish is her latest film while appearing on a podcast, per Page Six. Derbez said that her pronunciation was "indefensible" and that "every time she had a scene, we looked at each other to say, 'Wow, what is this?'"
Gomez seemingly caught wind of the critiques and left a comment under a clip from the podcast shared to TikTok.
"I understand where you are coming from.. I'm sorry I did the best I could with the time I was given," she wrote. "Doesn't take away from how much work and heart I put into this movie."
Following Gomez's comment, Derbez apologized for his "careless" remarks in a message shared to his TikTok.
"I truly apologize for my careless comments — they are indefensible and go against everything I stand for. As Latinos, we should always support one anther. There's no excuse. I was wrong, and I deeply admire your career and your kind heart," he said. "Emilia Pérez deserves to be celebrated, not diminished by my thoughtless remarks. I'm walking away from this with an important lesson learned."
Not everyone agreed with Derbez's initial take as it was revealed Monday (December 9) that Gomez received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film, alongside co-stars Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón. Gomez also received a nod for her role in Only Murders in the Building.
