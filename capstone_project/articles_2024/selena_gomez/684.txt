Selena Gomez is in it for the long haul with boyfriend Benny Blanco.
In a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gomez opened up about life in the spotlight and how she's been able to maintain somewhat of a private life with a close friend like Taylor Swift, and her relationship that she shares quick snapshots of on social media. Selena explained of giving fans a peek into her relationship this time around, "I guess this is the safest I’ve ever felt in one, and I see a future with this person." 
Gomez added, "And when you put a little bit out there, people are not as hungry to hunt you down. Like, if they hear something, they’re going to, but if you’re like, 'I did it,' they’re like, 'Oh, well there’s you, just going to Sushi Park.' But there’s so much of my relationship people don’t see, that’s just mine."
Blanco, who was included in PEOPLE's "Sexiest Man Alive" issue, opened up about his relationship with Selena, calling her his "true best friend that I get to do everything in the world with, and every day is the best day of my life."
Also in the interview, Blanco revealed that both he and Selena go "all out" for dates for each other, recalling one date where Gomez rented out "a whole botanical garden" for her boyfriend. But, they also appreciate the simple things. Benny told PEOPLE, "For Valentine's Day, I got her Taco Bell, I made her movie-theater nachos, I found her favorite pickles from Texas and I deep-fried them for her. Then [I had] all her candies and Hot Cheetos."
