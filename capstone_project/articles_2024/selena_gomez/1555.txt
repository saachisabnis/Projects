Selena Gomez said Monday she can’t carry children due to medical issues that would put her and a child’s life in danger.
“I haven’t ever said this, but I unfortunately can’t carry my own children,” she told Vanity Fair in a story published Monday. “I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while.”
Gomez, 32, has previously spoken publicly about her desire to have children despite the possible medical complications. She has previously undergone chemotherapy to treat the autoimmune disease lupus and had a kidney transplant in 2017 due to lupus complications. She also takes two medications to treat her bipolar disorder.
“I’m in a much better place with that,” she told Vanity Fair. “I find it a blessing that there are wonderful people willing to do surrogacy or adoption, which are both huge possibilities for me. It made me really thankful for the other outlets for people who are dying to be moms. I’m one of those people.”
The “Only Murders in the Building” star said in an interview with Rolling Stone in November 2022 that she was worried about carrying her own children, telling the magazine, “that’s a very big, big, present thing in my life” but that “however I’m meant to have them, I will.”
In Monday’s interview, Gomez also spoke about her relationship with boyfriend Benny Blanco, which she confirmed in December 2023. A few months later, Blanco went on Howard Stern’s radio show and told the host he hopes to marry Gomez one day.
“After the interview, I was dying laughing,” Gomez told Vanity Fair. “Like, ‘Anything else you wanted to put out there?’”
