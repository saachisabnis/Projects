Simon, the nation’s largest operator of malls, outlet centers, mixed-used and entertainment destinations, has launched a nationwide campaign portraying malls as the go-to destination across generations.
Dubbed “Meet Me @themall,” the multifaceted campaign blends ‘80s and ‘90s nostalgia with videos and ads depicting Gen Zers meeting up in the mall, taking selfies, applying cosmetics and trying on clothes as their Millennial or Gen X parents gleefully watch on. While there are no set definitions for each generation, members of Gen Z are in their tweens to mid-20s and were born roughly between 1997 and 2012. Millennials were born in the early 1980s to the mid-1990s.

Although there was a post-pandemic rush back to shopping brick-and-mortar stores, malls have been impacted by the rise of e-commerce, Amazon, retail closings and shifts in consumer spending priorities. The rising cost of living has also been impacting discretionary spending, though inflation is coming down, the stock market is near a record high, and consumers have shown resilience in spending. Simon’s latest campaign serves as a reminder that malls can be a fun gathering place for socializing, as well as for shopping, dining and entertainment.

The videos in the campaign feature a recreation of the 1985 hit song, “Don’t You Forget About Me” by the Scottish rock band Simple Minds, which was memorably played on the soundtrack of the movie “The Breakfast Club” released in 1985. In Simon’s version, the song asks: “Won’t you meet me at the mall?” In a statement, Simon indicated that the campaign blends ‘80s and ‘90s nostalgia with a new generation that wants to shop, eat, stay and play at the mall as much as their parents do.
Lee Sterling, Simon’s chief marketing officer, said, “This new campaign is Simon’s invitation for everyone to gather in a place that has always brought joy, community and memorable experiences.”
The ads are the first step in a broader campaign that headlines creator content to generate enthusiasm among Gen Z and their parents “to find new connections and experiences at the mall,” Simon said. More than 250 talent, creators and influencers are partnering with Simon, including the stars of the ad’s hero spot: Alejandro Rosario, The Pitman Sisters, Gym Tan, Mya Miller, Preshous Jordan and Dan Pelosi, among others.

 









“While Gen Zers may find their moms cringey, it turns out that they have developed a love for many of the same things their parents did: from fashion to movies to music and the mall,” said Sterling. “At Simon, we are all about bringing multiple generations together to seek new connections, have fun and make shared memories along the way. While the mall experience has evolved over the years, it continues to capture the zeitgeist of each generation.”
 A spokeswoman for Simon told FN sister publication WWD, “For Gen Z in particular, we are drawing upon their appreciation for retro fashion, music and movies — the cultural landmarks of their parents’ youth.” She contended that “Despite the widely held perception that Gen Z is always online, it turns out that they can’t get enough of shopping — and connecting — in person.”
The spots were created in partnership with SuperBloom House and directed by Matty Peacock, who is known for his collaborations with Billie Eilish, Cardi B, Selena Gomez, The 1975, One Republic and Demi Lovato. Peacock is a member of the SuperBloom House Creative Collective.
Simon also has launched @themall social channels on TikTok and Instagram designed to celebrate mall culture and their diverse experiences.
