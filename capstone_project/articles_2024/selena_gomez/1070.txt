Nicolas Cage will star as iconic football coach and commentator John Madden in the upcoming film Madden, directed written, and produced by Oscar-nominee David O. Russell. “Nicolas Cage, one of our greatest and most original actors, will portray the best of the American spirit of originality, fun, and determination in which anything is possible as beloved national legend John Madden,” Russell said in a statement. “Together with the ferocious style, focus, and inspired individualism of Al Davis, owner of the underdog Oakland Raiders, the feature will be about the joy, humanity and genius that was John Madden in a wildly inventive, cool world of the 1970s.” Further casting details will be announced at a later stage. Russell, who George Clooney called a “miserable f-ck” in a new interview, is also developing a Linda Ronstadt biopic starring Selena Gomez. (Variety)
