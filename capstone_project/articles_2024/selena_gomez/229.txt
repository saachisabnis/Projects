Are Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco engaged? 
That seems to be the question on everyone's minds after the icon was spotted at this year's Emmy Awards, held on Sunday (September 15), with a diamond ring perfectly placed on THAT finger. 
According to Daily Mail, the "Come & Get It" artist sparked engagement rumors in a dazzling black and silver gown complete with matching jewelry. It wasn't so much the earrings and bracelets that caused fans to speculate, as Gomez flaunted a silver ring wrapped in diamonds. 
Photos from the illustrious event depict the 32-year-old songstress posing for a few snaps with her hands visible, each strewn with rings including one on her wedding finger. Selenators wasted no time igniting rumors of the alleged wedding hardware and possible engagement to Blanco. 
The "Single Soon" hitmaker posted a series of snaps on Instagram following the show, in which she was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in "Only Murders in the Building", showcasing her breathtaking fit and PDA-packed red carpet moment with her beloved beau. 
The producer, who Gomez has previously referred to as her "best friend" and the "love of her life," commented on the post with a subtle "omg!!!" 
See the standout's post below along with a few additional red carpet photos from the event that draw partial attention to the ring in question.
