Who would have guessed that 2024’s best new series would follow a power struggle in 17th-century feudal Japan? Me! That’s who. Starring Hiroyuki Sanada, Shōgun was on the top of my list since I first heard about the FX limited series last summer. With complex politics, storylines based in real Japanese history, and uber-cinematic production quality, Shōgun has surely lived up to its lofty expectations.

Gaining the trust and friendship of some of the most famous socialites of the time, Capote shockingly turned around and published all their secrets in this very magazine. The result? Drama to the highest degree.
