Selena Gomez loves pickles. But Benny Blanco's watermelon pickle sandwich? Not so much.
The 36-year-old music producer posted a hilarious TikTok video on Friday sharing how he came across this culinary concoction he calls watermelon pickle sandwich. Two blocks of watermelon serve as bread and the toppings include cheese, pickles, balsamic and basil.
Delicious?
Before taking a bite, Blanco admits the snack looks "f***ing disgusting" but he powers through. His immediate reaction?
"It's not bad," he says after masticating his newfound invention.
In the background you can hear Gomez, 31, say something to him before she enters the frame and -- proving she's quite the trooper -- is convinced to take a bite, and it goes as well as you'd expect. There was, however, a sweet moment when Gomez got a bit of watermelon juice on the tip of her nose, which Blanco wiped away with his finger.
But Gomez couldn't help it. The "sandwich" had her shaking her head. 
Nevertheless, fans loved the video.
"I want more Selena and Benny content," one fan commented. "Another wrote, "Awwww I love this one! And I think I'd agree with Selena!"
Gomez and Blanco have been giving fans a glimpse into their lives as of late. Just last week, they took part in the TikTok challenge "Who's Most Likely To: Couples Edition," in which Gomez revealed she was the first one to say "I love you" in the relationship.
By the way, watermelon pickle sandwich aside, Blanco's a stud in the kitchen. Back in March, the producer participated in a livestream on TalkShopLive in support of his cookbook, Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends, and dished on his girlfriend's favorite meal.
"She's a huge steak fan, so anything with steak in it," he shared. "She always asks for steak and she always asks for these little perfect fried potatoes." 
The "Eastside" producer also shared she enjoys a pasta dish that he highlights in the book. She also loves soup.
Hopefully sans pickles.
