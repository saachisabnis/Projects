In effect, “Only Murders in the Building” is streaming entertainment’s version of a charm offensive. The multi-genre, multi-generational Hulu original has something — and someone — for everyone. Its three leads are, for the most part, inherently likable. Steve Martin and Martin Short have been building goodwill for decades, and Selena Gomez has been accruing a loyal fanbase of young’uns since her purple-clad co-star was Barney. (Now, of course, it’s Short.) Sprinkle in affable recurring guests like Nathan Lane, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Jackie Hoffman, Jayne Houdyshell, and Tina Fey — all in the first few seasons — and “the Building” becomes a hot spot for big-name talent.

But the series’ intrinsic appeal goes well beyond its popular cast. A perpetual fall/winter season provides plenty of occasions for warm and cozy looks. The Arconia’s Upper West Side origins offer inspiring interior design opportunities. Heck, even the story allows viewers to pick and choose what to focus on: You can attentively tune in week after week trying to solve that season’s mystery before Charles (Martin), Oliver (Short), and Mabel (Gomez), or you can casually check out the comedy, chuckling along with our amateur sleuths while the specific plot points play out in the background.
All of these elements contribute to “Only Murders in the Building’s” continued success, but only one feels like it’s threatening to upend the balance. After all, any charismatic salesmen knows that too much charm can be just as futile as too little. Sure, if you’re too laid back, the customer may lose interest, but lay it on too thick, and you’re an obnoxious sales agent with dollar signs in your eyes. “Only Murders in the Building” Season 4 isn’t obnoxious. It’s still on the right side of the entertaining/exhausting divide. But through seven episodes of the new season, the sheer onslaught of celebrity guest stars threatens to tip the scales.
To be fair, this has happened before — just not to this extent. At least in Season 4, showrunner John Hoffman gives himself good reason to cast a few extra famous faces. Just as last season was set in the theater world (and previous seasons took meta winks at TV and podcasting), this season is driven by the movies. The “Only Murders” podcast has become such a hit, Hollywood producers want to turn it into a feature film, and development is moving quickly. A writer (played by “Pachinko’s” Jin Ha) has already carved out a script, a producer (Molly Shannon) is already putting together a shooting schedule, and the main cast is already in place.

 









Charles, Oliver, and Mabel meet their on-screen counterparts during a promotional party in L.A. meant to build buzz around the nascent project, and their initial dynamics couldn’t be more appealing. Upset over his character’s description as an “unfun turtle,” Charles tries to show off his festive side for Eugene Levy (playing himself). Mabel, meanwhile, is worried that anyone looking at her life from the outside will only see a “homeless, jobless, mumbler,” and her fears aren’t exactly quelled when the film casts Eva Longoria to play her. (Focus groups thought the age gap between Mabel and the guys was “creepy.”) But it’s Oliver’s pairing that proves particularly perfect. Never one to miss a meta reference, Hoffman creates a delightful exchange where Short and Zach Galifianakis get to wink at their iconic talkshow creations: Short’s original awful interviewer, Jiminy Glick, and Galifianakis’ aughts-era successor in “Between Two Ferns.”
The duo proves to be so good together, it can feel as if “Only Murders” is working extra hard to justify additional screentime for the two men playing Oliver, be it via a bonus bonding montage (after they’ve largely sorted out any bad blood) or improbable pop-ins, despite each actor living on the opposite coast. Their spiked barbs garner enough laughs to warrant the logistical reaches (especially since so much of the humor elsewhere is nice and neighborly), but they don’t cover them up. Anyone whose skepticism is piqued by how this new trio of celebrities is shown off will likely grow weary of just how many more show up.

 









Of the names I’m allowed to mention (others have been deemed spoilers by Hulu), there’s Jane Lynch as Sazz Pataki, Charles’ long-time stunt double whose dead body was shown at the end of Season 3; Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Kind, Daphne Rubin-Vega, and Desmin Borges, all of whom play renters living across from the Arcadia who may know something about Sazz’s death; Melissa McCarthy in a plum role where, if you can believe it, she seems to enjoy making people uncomfortable, and… oh yeah, Meryl Streep as Loretta, who’s trying to sustain a long-distance relationship with Oliver (all while the two real-life actors are barely trying to hide their own quite-close relationship?).
When I tell you that’s not all, believe me: The many recognizable names listed in this review might make up two-thirds of the notable newcomers traipsing through Season 4. Part of the problem is simple: It’s celebrity overload. Cameo culture may have helped “Deadpool vs. Wolverine” and many of Marvel’s other metaverse movies rake in billions at the box office, but eventually all you’re doing is waiting for the next famous so-and-so to show up. It’s like watching a parade, and every new float better have a bigger name waving at you than the last one (which, when you start with Meryl Streep, can be pretty difficult to do).

 









“Only Murders” Season 4 could’ve avoided some of its over-saturation issue simply by hewing more closely to its Hollywood motif. Rather than casting famous actors as anyone and everyone, why not only cast celebrities as versions of themselves? If Charles, Oliver, and Mabel are taking meetings and cutting deals, they’ve got good reason to cross paths with Hollywood big-wigs. That’s why they meet Galifianakis, Longoria, and Levy in the first place. Not only does it make narrative sense, but being known to the audience also provides a shortcut for character development. Since viewers already have an idea of who these people are (Levy is a nice guy! Longoria is socially conscious! Galifianakis is a goofball!), each performer can play into or against those assumptions to flesh out their alternative persona while still scoring quick laughs.
But Nanjiani, McCarthy, Shannon, and a few more I can’t mention are all playing fictionalized characters. Fill those roles with up-and-comers, and maybe viewers will latch onto the part as much as the performer (like James Caverly as Theo Dimas in Season 1). Maybe they won’t be distracted by the beautiful celebrities, and they’ll still be able to fully appreciate the vibrant set design, enviable outfits, and meticulous mystery. Maybe they’ll be spared the inevitable disappointment felt whenever the next suspect shows up and he isn’t played by Tom Hanks. (No, Hanks is not in Season 4. Well, not yet. Who knows!)

 









To be clear, “Only Murders” Season 4 is still fun. It’s still funny. It’s still well-made and obviously well-acted. It’s even smart enough to steer attention back to our original trio in a way that leaves no doubt who we’re meant to care about the most. It’s just a little too enamored by everyone it can cast to realize maybe it would be better not to cast everyone just because it can. They’ve got enough charm in-house. Don’t put us off by going overboard. 
“Only Murders in the Building” premieres Tuesday, August 27 on Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly.
