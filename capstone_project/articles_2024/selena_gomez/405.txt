Here at OK! we love it when a celebrity shares their favourite beauty products – and even more so when they don't cost a fortune. And Molly-Mae Hague has done just that, raving about a hydrating face cream as an affordable alternative to a much pricier product that she loves.
In a recent YouTube video, the mum-of-one talks about Aveeno Face Calm + Restore Oat Gel Moisturiser, calling in "fricking insane" and comparing it to the viral Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream. In the clip she says, "this is not to say that Tatcha is not incredible because it is, but this is for my girls that want a more affordable product." And she's not wrong there, as this Aveeno cream costs £11.99 from retailers such as LookFantastic and Amazon compared to Tatcha's much pricier £67 – that's a saving of over £55.
Aveeno Calm + Restore claims to keep skin feeling moisturised for up to 24 hours, and contains prebiotic oat extract, which is known to be soothing and hydrating on delicate skin. This make this face cream ideal for anyone with sensitive or eczema-prone skin like Molly-Mae. As its name suggests, it also has a lightweight gel-cream texture that doesn't feel greasy or heavy.
 Tatcha The Dewy Cream Cream is also a favourite with celebrities including Selena Gomez –who loves the long-lasting glow it gives skin – while Meghan Markle is reportedly also a fan of the brand. 
This isn't the first time that the former Love Islander has shared her love for Aveeno products. She has spoken openly about her struggles with eczema, and recently revealed that Aveeno Skin Relief Body Oil Spray, £9.49, have been her must-have body product during the cold winter months.
This body oil is made with 98% natural ingredients, including oats again – oat oil this time – plus jojoba oil, to instantly relieve dry, itchy skin.
Sounds like these two products are definitely worth checking out!
