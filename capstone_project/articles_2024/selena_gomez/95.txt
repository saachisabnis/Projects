She posted a couple photos to her Instagram Story on Friday from behind the scenes of filming a new season of Only Murders in the Building.

Rock legend Rod Stewart recently claimed not to know any of Ed Sheeran‘s songs, but he has no such problem with Ed’s pal Taylor Swift. Speaking to the BBC, he says of Taylor, “She will go on forever.

Speaking of Taylor, Philippine Airlines is making the friendship bracelets, taking the moment and tasting it. Ahead of Taylor’s six Eras Tour shows in Singapore, which begin on March 2, the airline is passing out Swiftie-themed friendship bracelets to passengers headed to watch the concert at Singapore National Stadium. “Look what you made us do!” the airline captioned a post about the bracelets on Instagram.
