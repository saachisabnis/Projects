ALDI has just announced three brand new additions to their beauty range and they’re just as good as the high-end brands.
With prices starting at just £2.99, bargain loving beauty fans can bag a variety of goodies in store from tomorrow. 
From tinted lip oils and soothing lip treatments to self-heating face masks, the budget retailer has everything you need to gear up for winter. 
Colder autumnal days means my lips start to chap so I decided to give them a try.
First on the list, the Tinted Lip Oils, priced at just £3.99. ALDI’s popular health and beauty brand, Lacura, has introduced the new oil that rivals Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty products but at 79% less per shade. 
Formulated with Jojoba Seed and Sunflower Seed Oil, these lip oils come in three shades: 'Pink Rose', 'Merlot Moment', and 'Berry Bliss'.
Naturally, my eyes were drawn to 'Pink Rose', which has a lovely light, bubblegum pink hue. The other two shades, 'Merlot Moment' and 'Berry Bliss', are warmer, richer reds reminiscent of autumn leaves. 
These multitasking oils claim to work hard to hydrate and nourish lips for a visibly soft but plump finish.  
I tried them all, but I usually avoid dark red shades as they don’t quite suit my complexion. That’s not to say they weren’t lovely - they just weren’t for me.
When I applied the tinted oil to my lips, I immediately noticed its rich, nourishing texture. Unlike those cheap oil stains that dry out your lips, this one felt hydrating, and a little goes a long way. 
What really impressed me was how long the colour lasted.
Even after using a wet wipe and face wash, the tint remained, meaning I didn’t have to constantly reapply.
These tinted lip oils are definitely worth putting in your shopping basket.
Next up were the self-heating eye masks, priced at £3.99. They’re said to be a dupe for the Spacemask Jasmine Scented Eyemask, which costs an eye watering £18.50. 
Featuring a stunning astrological print and available in two fragrances, Chamomile and Jasmine, the masks come with stretchy ear loops for a comfy fit.
They’re sold in packs of five, each lined with a soft, non-woven layer for added comfort and tranquillity in your skincare routine.
They’d also be great for hangover days, as the heat can help relieve tense muscles and ease those hangxiety thoughts
I decided to put one to the test during a relaxation session. I slipped the mask over my ears and eyes, sat back, and waited for the warmth to kick in. 
It took about 30 seconds to start heating up, and within a minute, I was thoroughly enjoying the soothing warmth across my eyes. 
The only downside was the scent - it wasn’t very strong - I could barely smell it at all.
These masks are perfect for a cosy Sunday, tucked under a blanket on the sofa. 
They’d also be great for hangover days, as the heat can help relieve tense muscles and ease those hangxiety thoughts.
Finally, I tried the Lacura Peptide Lip Treatment, which costs £2.99 and is similar to Hailey Bieber’s Rhode Skin Peptide Lip Treatment but 83% cheaper. 
ALDI’s version comes in 'Unscented', 'Watermelon', and 'Salted Caramel'. 
As someone who usually isn’t a fan of watermelon scents, I wanted to see if this one could change my mind. 
Surprisingly, it wasn’t as strong as I expected, but it was still too sweet for my liking.
These lip treatments are specially formulated with Shea Butter, Peptide, and Capuacu, promising long-lasting hydration for visibly softer, plumper, and glossier lips. 
I’ve struggled with treatments that dry out my lips once they’ve worn off, making me constantly reapply
And they delivered.
I did apply the product quite thickly which wasn’t necessary because like the tinted lip oil, a little goes a long way. 
In the past, I’ve struggled with treatments that dry out my lips once they’ve worn off, making me constantly reapply. 
But with ALDI’s, I found I didn’t have to. Definitely worth the £2.99.
All in all, ALDI’s latest beauty additions are a fantastic bargain, proving you don’t need to break the bank to look, and feel fabulous.
