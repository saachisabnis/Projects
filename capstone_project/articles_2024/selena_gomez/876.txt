The insanely popular Disney sitcom “Wizards of Waverly Place” is making a return.
Selena Gomez and her on-screen sibling David Henrie are set to reprise their roles for a new pilot for the Disney Channel, according to an exclusive report from Deadline.
Gomez confirmed the news through her Instagram stories on Thursday morning.
“So excited,” she wrote in one slide, which featured the Deadline article.
“We’re back,” she wrote over a throwback photo of her and Henrie.
The outlet reports the show will follow Henrie’s character, Justin Russo, as he navigates normal human life with his wife and two sons. This is after a “mysterious incident at WizTech.”
However, all that changes when a new generation of wizards needs his help.
Actors Janice LeAnn Brown, Alkaio Thiele and Mimi Gianopulos are also joining the cast.
Brown will play a young wizard in need of Henrie’s help. Thiele will be Henrie’s oldest son and Gianopulos will play his wife.
The project is the brainchild of writers and executive producers Jed Elinoff and Scott Thomas, who helped create “Raven’s Home,” another Disney Channel spinoff.
The original “Wizards of Waverly Place” series ran from 2007 to 2012.
