Angelina Jolie declined to discuss her ongoing divorce from her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “No,” she said to the reporter.
The actress and director, who filed for divorce in 2016, drew “firm boundaries” on personal topics, including her divorce status.
In the interview at her Los Angeles home, Jolie explained that she’s adapting to the changing dynamic between celebrities and their audience, saying, “I’m trying to get used to what to share.”
Jolie mentioned that she was forced to live in Los Angeles due to her divorce but plans to relocate once her youngest children turn 18.
“I grew up in this town. I am here because I have to be here from a divorce, but as soon as they’re 18, I’ll be able to leave,” she said.
