Oprah Winfrey was photographed in a pair of beige and gray sneakers before switching to brown pointed-toe pumps for an appearance on “Good Morning America” in New York City.
The media maven arrived at the morning show’s studio wearing a plum color turtleneck with mustard cargo pants and a pair of beige and gray sneakers, that looked similar to New Balance’s 574 style or Reebok’s Classic Leather Legacy. Winfrey’s sneakers featured a small platform sole, that could provide a bit of height and comfort. 
The sneaker featured a mix of neutral tones, including tan soles, and white and gray midsoles with tan uppers. A classic gum rippled outsole, a heel stability unit and a sleek forefoot with white laces.

The former talk show host then opted for a pair of heels that featured a reddish brown colorway and a closed-back design that locked her in feet in place as she walked around the city. While the back of her shoes couldn’t be seen completely, it’s likely the set was completed by a stiletto heel ranging between 3-to-4 inches in height. Winfrey paired her pumps with a pair of brown cargo dress pants and a purple long sleeve top.
