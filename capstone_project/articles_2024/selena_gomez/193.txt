"The Bear" will overwhelmingly dominate the Emmy nominations when they're announced on Wednesday morning, July 17. That's according to the combined predictions of more than 3,300 Gold Derby users who have placed their bets here in our predictions center. Scroll down for our complete predictions in 25 top categories listed by program. Our projected winners are highlighted in gold.
FX's dramedy about the staff at a struggling Chicago restaurant is expected to pick up an astronomical 16 nominations across seven comedy categories. Of those we're expecting it to win Best Comedy Series, Best Comedy Actor (Jeremy Allen White), Best Comedy Supporting Actor (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), Best Comedy Guest Actress (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Best Comedy Guest Actor (Jon Bernthal). Those 16 predicted noms exceed the 13 that the show received last year, and that doesn't even include fields like writing, directing, casting, editing and much more.
Another FX program, the historical drama "Shogun," is next in line with a predicted nine nominations, of which it's the front-runner to claim Best Drama Series, Best Drama Actress (Anna Sawai), Best Drama Actor (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Best Drama Guest Actor (Nestor Carbonell). Even more than "The Bear," the lavishly staged "Shogun" has the potential to clean up in Creative Arts races thanks to its high production values.
"The Crown" is predicted for eight bids, which would already improve on last year's six total nominations before factoring in below-the-line races. "The Morning Show" is also looking to improve its fortunes with seven anticipated nominations. The last time the show was eligible, in 2022, it only scored three noms. The door is wide open for both of these shows to expand their Emmy footprints because most of last year's drama nominees are out of contention in 2024, either because they're on hiatus or because they went off the air entirely. That includes "Succession," which crowded out other shows for the last two years with a record acting nominations hauls.
Emmy winners Tony Hale and Sheryl Lee Ralph will announce the nominees on Wednesday at 8:30am Pacific/11:30am Eastern. The announcement will stream on Emmys.com/nominations.
