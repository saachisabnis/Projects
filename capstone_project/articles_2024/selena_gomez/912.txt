Anne Hathaway shook, shook, shook it off at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert in Germany Friday night.
The 41-year-old actress was filmed by a fan moving and grooving to several of the pop star’s hits at her third and final show in Gelsenkirchen. The concertgoer, who shared her videos on X, caught Hathaway rocking out to “…Ready For It?”, “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space.”
The “Devil Wears Prada” star seemed to never tire out from all the fun, as she was seen showing off her moves and throwing her hands excitedly into the air throughout all three videos. 
For the show, she wore white shorts and a button-down shirt, accessorizing the look with yellow heart sunglasses.
According to the fan, Hathaway brought one of her sons to watch the Eras Tour with her. Her son reportedly handed out snacks and water bottles to people from the VIP area.
She shares sons Jonathan, 8, and Jack, 4, with her husband, Adam Shulman. The couple chooses to keep them out of the spotlight. 
The Academy Award-winning actress has been a longtime supporter of the “Cruel Summer” singer, calling her “a magnificent creature” during a 2015 chat with Glamour magazine.
Of course, Hathway is just one of the several celebrities who have trotted across the globe to catch Swift, 34, on tour. Other stars who have watched the record-breaking show include Selena Gomez, Cara Delevignge, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Prince William and more. 
Her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, has attended several of her shows in Argentina, Australia, Singapore, France, England, Ireland and the Netherlands.
He has also supported her in Germany despite having to report to the Kansas City Chiefs training camp just a day later.
