(TMX) - Selena Gomez shared that she is unable to carry children due to her health issues, and she grieved the fact before settling on achieving motherhood through surrogacy or adoption.
The actress, singer, and Rare Beauty founder, 32, spoke on the topic in an interview published in the October issue of Vanity Fair, published Monday. 
“I haven’t ever said this ... but I unfortunately can’t carry my own children,” Gomez said. “I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while.”
Gomez has previously shared details on her journey with lupus after her diagnosis in 2015 and later experiencing complications of the autoimmune disease. In 2020, she revealed she was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the medication for which can be detrimental to a developing fetus.
“I’m in a much better place with that. I find it a blessing that there are wonderful people willing to do surrogacy or adoption, which are both huge possibilities for me,” Gomez told Vanity Fair.
“It made me really thankful for the other outlets for people who are dying to be moms. I’m one of those people,” she said. “I’m excited for what that journey will look like, but it’ll look a little different. At the end of the day, I don’t care. It’ll be mine. It’ll be my baby.”
In the interview, Gomez also discussed her relationship with Benny Blanco.
“I’ve never been loved this way. ... He’s just been a light. A complete light in my life. He’s my best friend. I love telling him everything,” she said. She also addressed Blanco’s recent appearance on “The Howard Stern Show,” in which he revealed he wanted to marry her.
“After the interview, I was dying laughing. Like, ‘Anything else you wanted to put out there?’” she recalled.
