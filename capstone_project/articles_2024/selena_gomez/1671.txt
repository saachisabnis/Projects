Selena Gomez is feeling all the love at the Cannes Film Festival.
At the premiere of her latest film, Emilia Perez, Gomez walked the red carpet in an off-the-shoulder Saint Laurent gown. The actor and singer looked every bit like a Hollywood starlet in a black velvet column dress, which featured a draped white satin neckline that elegantly wrapped around her shoulders. With the help of stylist Erin Walsh, Gomez amplified her ensemble’s classic movie-star feel with an intricate diamond collar necklace and dangling Bulgari diamond earrings. She also carried a small black clutch.
The Only Murders in the Building star looked radiant on the red carpet, thanks to a combination of her palpable excitement and glowing glam. She opted for a minimal, matte beauty look, which included a fluttery pair of false lashes and a simple nude lip. Her dark hair was swept into a glossy, high ponytail with curtain bangs, while she also debuted a fiery red manicure to pop against her black-and-white ensemble.
According to Variety and Deadline, the singer and actress broke down in tears later in the day as her film Emilia Pérez received a standing ovation lasting 11 minutes. The outlets also reported that Gomez’s co-stars in the new film, Zoe Saldaña and Édgar Ramírez, shared a hug in reaction to the crowd standing up and cheering, while director Jacques Audiard waved his hat from the balcony where he sat.
On Sunday, the cast attended a photocall together, where Gomez once again stole the show. She looked incredible in an off-the-shoulder red gown, detailed with multi-dimensional roses across the bust. The actor complemented the A-line dress with matching red heels and silver hoops encrusted with diamonds, as well as a brown smokey eyeshadow and matte nude lip. She wore her hair down in a bouncy blowout with a deep side part.
In Emilia Pérez, Gomez plays the wife of feared drug cartel leader Manitas (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón) who seeks out lawyer Rita (Saldaña) to help him secretly complete a sex change operation to become a woman as he approaches retirement from the business. Per Variety, the movie is divided into four acts and also features original songs performed by the cast throughout.
