Selena Gomez‘s Only Murders in the Building is always full of clues for murder-mystery lovers, but in a new episode, the show may have also had an Easter egg for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fans.

	Viewers were quick to spot a possible reference to the “Anti-Hero” singer in the Tuesday (Oct. 8) episode of the Emmy-winning Hulu show, which finds the Rare Beauty founder and costars Martin Short and Steve Martin visiting an eclectic doll-filled house owned by guest star Melissa McCarthy, who plays the sister of Martin’s character. At one point, Gomez’s Mabel sits down next to a life-size doll that bears a striking resemblance to Swift, complete with blonde hair and trim bangs.

	










	Plus, the doll in question sports a jersey with the digits “87” on it, which also happens to be the “Karma” artist’s boyfriend’s Kansas City Chiefs number. Swift herself has also sported a number of “87” accessories in real life, too, with the 14-time Grammy winner often representing Kelce’s call sign on jackets, hats and cups when attending games at Arrowhead Stadium.

	“wait guys taylor cameo in the new ep of only murders in the building??? and she’s wearing an 87 shirt omg help 😭😭” one fan wrote on X after the episode aired, sharing a clip of the scene. 

Another viewer tweeted alongside a snapshot of the scene, “i was watching the new episode of only murders in the building and..IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE TAYLOR?😭”

	The new episode comes a little over a month after Gomez addressed the possibility of a Swift cameo in Only Murders in an interview with E! News, during which the “Calm Down” artist said of her longtime bestie, “She’s a little busy, you guys.”

	When the reporter suggested that Swift simply walk by on the street in an episode, Gomez said, “I love that.”

	“Here’s how I unite Taylor Swift and Selena,” Martin jumped in at the time. “Taylor Swift handles everything perfectly and so does Selena. In the situations I’ve seen — politically, trolls, everything — she just seems to have a wisdom about how to do something quietly, effortlessly. And I know that you have to think about these things.”
