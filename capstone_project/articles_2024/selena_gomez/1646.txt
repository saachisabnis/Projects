Selena Gomez is sharing a vulnerable look into her health journey, revealing that she "can't carry [her] own children" due to her "medical issues."
In a new cover story with Vanity Fair, the 32-year-old Rare Beauty founder opened up about how her health struggles have affected her potential future parenthood journey, per E! News. Gomez has been transparent about her battle with lupus since being diagnosed in 2013, eventually having a kidney transplant in 2017, Page Six reports.
"I haven't ever said this, but I unfortunately can't carry my own children," she said. "I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby's in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while."
However, Gomez isn't letting the setback keep her from dreaming about her future family. Even though welcoming a child into her life will look different to what she had imagined it would be, the "Love On" singer is "excited" for what the future will bring.
"It's not necessarily the way I envisioned it," she said. "I thought it would happen the way it happens for everyone. [But] I'm in a much better place with that. I find it a blessing that there are wonderful people willing to do surrogacy or adoption, which are both huge possibilities for me."
She added, "I'm excited for what that journey will look like, but it'll look a little different. At the end of the day, I don't care. It'll be mine. It'll be my baby."
Earlier this year, the Only Murders in the Building star shared how she previously had plans to adopt children as a single mother before her relationship with boyfriend Benny Blanco.
