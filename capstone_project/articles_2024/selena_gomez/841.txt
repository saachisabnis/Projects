Kendall Jenner posting shoeless pictures of her at the famous Louvre Museum in Paris has some of her followers in an uproar.
The 28-year-old shared photos on Instagram June 26 of her at the museum. She wore a matching black top and skirt set and no shoes in the pictures.
"The Louvre at midnight," she captioned the post. 
The museum is closed at that time, according to its website. TODAY.com has reached out to Jenner for comment.
Some of her 292 million Instagram followers took to the comments to slam her decision to not wear shoes in the historic museum.
"Tasteless," someone wrote.
"Where are your shoes girl," another asked.
"Respect is lacking. No one should be allowed barefoot in spaces such as this," a third added.
"I'm so thrown off by barefeet at the Louvre," someone else said.
"We get it. You're filthy rich you can get the louvre to open at midnight just for you to walk barefoot around the historic halls," a fifth person wrote.
But other commenters complimented her look and her experience without mentioning her bare feet.
“You know how powerful this woman is when she can have all the Louvre for herself in the middle of the night," wrote one.
"You’re still the most beautiful ART," a second said.
“Kendall, your beauty is absolutely breathtaking!” added another.
Jenner isn't the only celebrity to make an appearance out and about with no shoes on in recent years. In 2018, Kristen Stewart partially walked the Cannes Film Festival red carpet shoeless after removing her shoes on the carpet. In 2022, Selena Gomez presented an award at the annual Screen Actors Guild Awards barefoot.
