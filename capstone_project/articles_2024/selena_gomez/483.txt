Selena Gomez is looking back at one of her most iconic roles and why she enjoyed often being mistaken for the character in real life.
During a recent appearance on the Awards Chatter podcast, the "Love On" singer reflected on the reaction she would get from kids watching Wizards of Waverly Place, which she starred as Alex Russo from 2007 to 2012, noting that some had trouble separating her from her character, per People. 
"I mean, I've had kids come up to me, and they only know me as Alex. You know? And they'll have full conversations like, 'Where's your wand?' she said, adding, "I think that's probably a moment I'll never forget where I recognized we had this influence to make people and kids feel good."
The Rare Beauty founder also shared how the live audience reaction to the cast filming the show gave her "the biggest high" because she loved making people, especially children in the crowd, laugh.
"We would do our tapings for Wizards in front of a live audience every Friday night. And that was the biggest high I could ever get. It was the coolest feeling to make a kid laugh uncontrollably because it's pure," she said.
Gomez recently stepped back into her role as Alex Russo for Wizards Beyond Waverly Place, sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the cast and crew while sharing how she felt like she was making her younger self proud.
