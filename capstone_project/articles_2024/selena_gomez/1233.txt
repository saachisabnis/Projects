Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco began dating in July 2023, around Selena’s birthday, Benny said on the Howard Stern Show in May 2024.
But they only began to spark romance rumors in late 2023. That December, Selena confirmed the speculation, commenting on a fan page’s Instagram post, regarding Benny, “He is my absolute everything in my heart.”
She continued, “Why has he been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. He’s still better than anyone I’ve ever been with.”
The Rare Beauty founder also shared a photo on her Instagram Story of her leaning her head on what looked to be Benny’s chest.
