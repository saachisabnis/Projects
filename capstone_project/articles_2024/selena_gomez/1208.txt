Selena was dating Justin Bieber, Diddy’s friend and mentee, at the time
P Diddy is at the centre of some pretty negative attention at the moment, and him and Justin Bieber’s friendship hasn’t gone unnoticed. However, an old interview from 2016 saw Selena Gomez retell an insane encounter she had with P Diddy where he mistook her for the valet when out with her then boyfriend Justin, Diddy’s friend and mentee.
Back in 2016, she did an interview with GQ where she recounted her strange experience meeting P Diddy. The interview was mainly centred around her new experiences with fame and feeling a little like an outsider: “When you’re around four people and everybody has the champagne glass, and somebody says something and they laugh but they didn’t say a joke.”

It must have been ostracising to have been mistaken for the valet when Justin brought her to meet P Diddy for the first time. She told GQ: “P. Diddy gave me his valet ticket once. Do you know what I mean?”
It was public knowledge that Selena Gomez was dating Justin at the time so it seems pretty unlikely P Diddy wouldn’t have known who she was, but we don’t know any more details about the encounter.
Although, Selena seemed to brush the whole thing off as a lighthearted misunderstanding in that angelic Selena way. She reassured the interviewer that “I don’t care – I actually laughed hysterically when it happened. But I get it. I know what all of it is.”

Justin has yet to make a statement about the P Diddy reports, but insiders told the Daily Mail that “Bieber is so disturbed by the Diddy news and is unwilling to process it or discuss it, so he has shut off. So many people who helped to make him who he is were very close to Diddy and it has completely thrown him.”
