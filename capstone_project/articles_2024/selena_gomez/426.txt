Taylor Swift braved the truly pouring rain in New York City yesterday (January 9) to visit Electric Lady Studios, stepping out in a cozy winter outfit that I'll be replicating immediately. Specifically, I'm talking Tay's green dress (a color she's been favoring lately!), which is basically just a giant sweater.
Designer details are TBD, but Taylor's look is actually very easy to recreate due to Amazon having a pretty much identical sweater dress for...are you ready for it ðŸ˜‰...juuust under $40 (well, $39.99 to be exact). Like, picture this without the belt and it's basically Taylor's exact 'fit:

Meanwhile, the singer completed her ~lewk~ with a wool coat from Stella McCartney in addition to some knee-high black boots and a stack of gold necklaces because one can never have too many.
Tay's appearance in New York comes after a quick trip to Los Angeles, where she was nominated for a Golden Globe for The Eras Tour concert film. Just gonna note that she wore green on the carpet, in case you're in the mood to read into things:
And speaking of the Golden Globes...ICYMI, Selena Gomez went ahead and revealed exactly what she said to Taylor during *that* commercial break convo. And no, it had nothing to do with TimothÃ©e Chalamet or Kylie Jenner denying her a photo. "Nooooo I told Taylor about two of my friends who hooked up," Sel said under an Instagram post from E! News. "Not that that's anyone's business."
