Cameron Bailey, CEO and programmer of the Toronto International Film Festival, has revealed newÂ four more esteemed honourees who will be receiving a TIFF Tribute Award at this yearâ€™s Festival.
These include French songwriting and composing duoÂ Camille DalmaisÂ andÂ ClÃ©ment DucolÂ who will be presented with the TIFFÂ VarietyÂ Artisan Award for composing the soundtrack for Jacques Audiardâ€™sÂ Emilia PÃ©rez, a Netflix film. The award recognizes distinguished creatives who have excelled at their craft and made an outstanding contribution to cinema and entertainment.Â 
"In a bountiful year of music in film, Camille Dalmais and ClÃ©ment Ducolâ€™sÂ Emilia PÃ©rezÂ compositions stand out for their passion and vitality. Weâ€™re pleased to present them with the TIFFÂ VarietyÂ Artisan Award," Bailey said.
Camille DalmaisÂ (Corsage, TIFF â€™22) andÂ ClÃ©ment DucolÂ (Little Tickles) are prominent figures in the French music scene, often collaborating to create innovative and experimental works. Camille, known for her unique vocal style and blending of pop, folk, and avant-garde elements, has gained acclaim with albums likeÂ Le Sac des FillesÂ andÂ Le Fil.
ClÃ©ment Ducol, a versatile musician, arranger, and producer, enhances her projects with his creative arrangements and musical expertise. Together, they form a dynamic duo, pushing the boundaries of contemporary French music. Previous recipients of the TIFFÂ VarietyÂ Artisan Award include Å�ukasz Å»al in 2023; Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir in 2022; Ari Wegner in 2021; Terence Blanchard in 2020; and Roger Deakins in 2019. Â â€œVarietyÂ is honoured to be giving Camille and ClÃ©ment our annual Artisan Award at the Toronto International Film Festival,â€� said Jazz Tangcay, Senior Artisans Editor atÂ Variety.
â€œThe soundtrack toÂ Emilia PÃ©rezÂ is a character within the film and a true gift from these fine musicians. Each song and cue is a work of art. The operatic libretto is filled with highlights including Selena Gomezâ€™s Spanish pop song and Zoe SaldaÃ±aâ€™s gala number. We are such fans of their work and thrilled to present this award to them, recognizing their talent and contribution this year.â€�Â The 49th Toronto International Film Festival takes place September 5â€“15, 2024.
From renegade auteur Jacques Audiard comesÂ Emilia PÃ©rez,Â an audacious fever dream that defies genres and expectations. Through liberating song and dance and bold visuals, this odyssey follows the journey of four remarkable women in Mexico, each pursuing their own happiness. The fearsome cartel leader Emilia (Karla SofÃ­a GascÃ³n) enlists Rita (Zoe SaldaÃ±a), an unappreciated lawyer stuck in a dead-end job, to help fake her death so that Emilia can finally live authentically as her true self. Written and directed by Audiard (Rust and Bone, A Prophet), the double Cannes-winning film also stars Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, and Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez. It is set to release on Netflix on November 13, 2024.
