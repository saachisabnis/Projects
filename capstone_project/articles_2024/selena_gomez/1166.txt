Hailey Bieber appears to be clapping back at social media speculation about her marriage to Justin Bieber.
As a TikTok video theorizing that there is trouble in paradise between Hailey, 28, and Justin, 30, amassed nearly 5 million viewers through Monday, December 30, the Rhode Beauty founder took to her Instagram Story with a pointed post.
On Monday, Hailey reshared a viral video of TikToker EyeGotThyme repeating the phrase, “You’re not well, and it’s OK.” She wrote over the video, “Me to all of you on the internet 🫶🏻”
Hailey was seemingly responding to TikToker Sloan Hooks, who posted a video Sunday, December 29, speculating whether the Biebers spent the holidays together. According to Hooks, “It doesn’t seem like things are going too well.”
For her part, Hailey — who has been married to Justin since 2018 — has been reflecting on her momentous year, which included welcoming her and Justin’s first baby, son Jack Blues Bieber, in August.
In a black-and-white snap posted via her Instagram Stories on Sunday, Hailey looked off into the distance as she lifted her shirt to show her baby bump.
“Thank you 2024,” Hailey wrote alongside an angel emoji.
Justin revealed in August that Hailey had given birth to their son. “WELCOME HOME,” he captioned an Instagram image of Hailey touching Jack’s foot, which was wrapped in a blanket. “JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻.”
Days later, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Hailey and Justin — who tied the knot in 2019 — were in “total bliss” with the newborn.
“Hailey is enjoying and savoring these moments being a new mom,” the insider told Us in August. “She is over the moon and in mom zone, and completely focused on the health of the baby.”
Justin has also embraced fatherhood. “Justin is overjoyed and very hands-on. A lot of things will change,” the insider said. “He’s a dad now and will be a lot more private and protective and focused on the family first.”
Since welcoming Jack, Hailey and Justin have shared glimpses of their life with the newborn. In November, Hailey shared a snap of Jack snuggled to her chest while on an outdoor stroll with Justin.

As she navigates motherhood, Hailey shared she was striving to maintain a good work-life balance. “I’m only doing what feels comfortable for me physically, mentally and emotionally,” she shared in an October interview with Women’s Wear Daily.
Hailey’s dad, Stephen Baldwin, shared in December that Jack has started to grow “like a weed.”
“Actually, he looks like a little plump potato,” Baldwin, 58, told TooFab earlier this month. “He’s so cute. I can’t stand it. I want to say so much.”
