Britney Spears isn’t afraid to share her obsessions. On Tuesday (Oct. 15) the “Toxic” singer posted a lengthy tribute to her favorite women on Instagram Stories, reeling off a long list of famous singers, actresses and models who she is obsessed with.

	“Women I genuinely admire and have crazy girl crushes on 😘😘😘!!!” she wrote. “I have girlfriends I hang out with every now and then but it’s not the same as when we were younger !!! But why isn’t it ??? I wanted to share the women who inspire me !!!” Sure, there are friends she grew up with who she was so close to they finished each other’s sentences and even began to speak, walk and share mannerisms with.

	










	But eventually you “get married and you grow up an live worlds apart,” she said. So, Brit ran through a list of women who inspire her now. First up was former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, who she said is a “classic babe and seems so sweet!!!”

	She also had kind words for Vox Lux star Natalie Portman, who she called the “coolest person,” recalling meeting the star on a New York street and realizing they had the same shirt on. She also gave props to “I Luv It” singer Camila Cabello, “because she’s so darn pretty and she makes me giggle out loud !!! Her personality is so sweet and kooky I think it’s healthy to be silly !!! I wish I was more like that.”

	Britney then wondered if it’s “even normal to be that pretty ???” in reference to model Kendall Jenner and wrapped things up with shout outs to Selena Gomez and Drew Barrymore, just because they’re “literally gorgeous”; both women were on hand for Spears’ 2022 wedding to now ex-husband Sam Ashgari. In the end, Spears admitted that even she wasn’t sure why she committed all that to digital ink before wrapping up with a tease of what’s next. 

	“I’m away writing my novel and learning about myself,” said Spears, who penned two books with her mother, Lynne Spears, 2000’s Heart to Heart and 2001’s A Mother’s Gift, before releasing her 2023 tell-all memoir, The Woman in Me. At press time no additional information was available about the book from the singer who said in January that she will “never return to the music industry.”
