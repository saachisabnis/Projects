Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are proving they are couple goals, with the "Love On" singer sharing a sweet handwritten note from her boyfriend leaving her a romantic message. 
Gomez took to her Instagram Stories on Monday (April 29) to show off a heartfelt note that Blanco left her written on tissue paper. According to People, the cookbook author had documented the process of cooking the steak on his own Instagram earlier in the day, but ended up dropping it off with the note when he realized she was taking a nap so she could find it when she woke up.
"I love you! Sleep Well! I made you steak!" he wrote, also drawing a heart.
The Rare Beauty founder, who a source recently said claims is "so in love" with her music producer beau, also tagged Blanco in the snap and added a white heart emoji to share her own love back.

Gomez and Blanco have reportedly been dating since last summer but have known each other for years, even collaborating in the past. The Wizards of Waverly Place star confirmed their romance in December, writing, "He is my absolute everything in my heart," and saying that he's "the best thing that's ever happened to me."
Since the pair went official with their romance, they have not shied away from expressing their love for each other, sharing sweet backstage photos from awards shows as well as cuddly mornings in bed together. In March, Gomez shared a heartfelt tribute to her boyfriend for his birthday, praising her "love" alongside several PDA-packed pics.
