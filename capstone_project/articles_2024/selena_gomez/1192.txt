Last week Hailey Biebers dad asked us all to say a prayer for Justin and Hailey, and evidently Hailey isn't happy about it! Why the prayers? Could there be marriage woes?  And still to this day it seems we can't mention Justin's name without Selena Gomez's name close behind. Selena is in a "great place" with Benny, or is she?  Reports are coming out the picture painted isn't what it may be. Hailey is doing damage control this week with a very sweet and public post to hubby Justin who is celebrating his 30th. I give it to Hailey she puts up a good fight, will the public opinion eventually win? That Justin and Selena are to be together, kind of like the Brad and Jenn of yesterdays generation? Time will tell.. Happiness to all!
