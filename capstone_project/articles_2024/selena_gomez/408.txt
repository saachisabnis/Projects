Taylor Swift has been redefining squad goals since she began celebrating Independence Day with her friends in 2013.
The following year, she added a few celebrity A-listers and the invite list has only grown from there.
In 2016, Swift‚Äôs 4th of July party was the place to be with attendees including Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, Cara Delevingne and the singer‚Äôs then-boyfriend, Tom Hiddleston.
The Grammy winner took a break from hosting pals at her Rhode Island mansion between 2017 and 2022, which is when she was dating Joe Alwyn. The British actor preferred to keep their lives out of the public, but once they split in April 2023, Swift brought her party back.
Scroll down for a look back at all the celebrity guests who‚Äôve partied alongside Swift on 4th of July over the years:
Swift‚Äôs first Independence Day bash was a mellow celebration with her dancers from her Red Tour as the only guests.
Ingrid Michaelson, Lena Dunham, Jaime King, Emma Stone and Jessica Szohr all stopped by Swift‚Äôs house in Rhode Island to salute the U.S.A. the next year.
The girls took a dip in the pool, baked cakes and pies and memorably posed for a group photo, which the ‚ÄúWildest Dreams‚Äù songstress described as a ‚Äúfamily portrait‚Äù via Twitter.
Swift‚Äôs 2015 bash also included a handful of entertainment industry luminaries. Ed Sheeran and Hadid were all on hand to toast to America‚Äôs Birthday. Hadid brought her then-boyfriend, Joe Jonas, along for the weekend as well. Swift‚Äôs non-celeb pal Britany Maack was also there.
Model Martha Hunt, Empire‚Äôs Serayah and all three Haim sisters (Este, Danielle and Alana) all RSVP‚Äôd. Swift‚Äôs then-boyfriend Calvin Harris also came out to join the fun. The twosome called it quits in June 2016.
The summertime soiree included barbecues, bikinis and beach floaties as well as patriotic onesies for the nighttime festivities.
The Watch Hill, Rhode Island, estate became the party palace for Swift‚Äôs besties Karlie Kloss, Ruby Rose, Uzo Aduba, Delevingne, Hadid and Lively in July 2016. Lively‚Äôs husband, Ryan Reynolds, was also part of Swift‚Äôs summer crew, as was Hiddleston, who famously wore an ‚ÄúI Heart T.S.‚Äù tank in the ocean. (The pair split in November 2016.)
Haim‚Äôs Este, Sheeran, Maack and Swift‚Äôs childhood BFF Abigail Anderson enjoyed fireworks with the musician. The group had an indoor karaoke session and danced by the pool during the weekend.
Swift pressed pause on her annual bashes while dating Alwyn, whom she split from in April 2023. The singer then briefly romanced Matty Healy, but their relationship ended in June 2023.
