She’s the best thing at this party.
Brittany Mahomes gave a glimpse at the epic Eras Tour wrap party thrown in honor of pal Taylor Swift on Wednesday — with the star and husband Patrick paying homage to the Grammy winner and her “guy on the Chiefs.”
“My people🫶🏼,” Brittany captioned a carousel of Instagram pics from the event, which may have done double duty as Swift’s 35th birthday celebration.
The pregnant former trainer, 29, went fully “Fearless” with her look, sporting a silver fringed minidress, matching “Karma”-coded jacket by Alice + Olivia ($1,995 $1,197) and bedazzled knee-high boots.
She even wore her blond hair in curls reminiscent of Swift’s 2008 era that inspired hit songs like “Love Story” and “Forever & Always.”
The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, meanwhile, got all dressed up in a full tuxedo with tails, a white bow tie and a matching scarf to channel his inner Travis Kelce.
Swift’s boyfriend wore a very similar look when he made a surprise appearance alongside the singer during one of her Eras Tour stops in London this summer. The tight end, 35, had a “blast” as he helped kick off Swift’s performance of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” dressed in his dapper tux and top hat.
The Mahomeses weren’t the only attendees who dressed on theme for the night. Swift’s friend Ashley Avignone wore a fake snake around her neck, in a nod to 2017’s “Reputation.”
And rather than committing to a single era, the “Bejeweled” singer opted for a black Balmain dress ($4,290) with sparkling embroidery down the front.
She pulled her hair back into a loose bun and accessorized with the same De Beers diamond drop earrings ($36,000) she previously wore while out to dinner with BFF Gigi Hadid earlier this month.
Page Six exclusively reported that Kelce wanted to make this year’s birthday “extra special” for Swift with lots of surprises.
Kelce, 35, “has been shopping for Christmas and birthday gifts for Taylor for quite a while now,” according to our source, as he’s “not the type to leave these things to the last minute.”
Sources told us exclusively that the footballer showered his lady love in presents that included engraved jewelry and dozens of roses.
While we’ll have to wait and see what he gifted Taylor — or if this was indeed a birthday party — the Kansas City Chiefs player’s dad, Ed Kelce, gave a preview of what he would gift Swift for her big day.
“Trying to buy Taylor a present is like trying to buy Jason [Kelce] and Travis a present. There’s nothing they want that they don’t already have,” the dad of two said on a recent podcast appearance.
“You’re not going to impress Taylor Swift with a gift that costs $100,000,” he noted. “But get something that twists the strings of her heart that you spent 10 bucks on and she’ll just be all gooey. You gotta find something that triggers the emotions.”
The family-friendly Kansas City celebration is a far cry from Swift’s 34th birthday last year, when she wore a sparkly Clio Peppiatt minidress and was joined by tons of celebrity friends — including Sabrina Carpenter, Zoë Kravitz, Selena Gomez, Miles Teller, Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively and more —  in NYC for a glitzy night out.
Kelce and Swift didn’t spend her last birthday together due to their busy schedules. However, the “Grotesquerie” actor presented his lady love with a special Christmas gift several days later: a diamond-studded Wove bracelet that references their couple name, “TNT.”
Fans will be anxiously waiting to see if the star shows off her presents at the Chiefs game in Kansas City on Saturday.
