The next season of Only Murders in the Building is still a few months out, but we have some insight into why the podcasting trio is headed out West. The Hulu series took to its official Instagram account to post a picture of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez in character alongside Eugene Levy, Zach Galifianakis and Eva Longoria in identical outfits. The latter three are set to play Charles, Oliver and Mabel respectively in an in-show film based on the podcast. The storyline is the next logical progression for the series’ meta-commentary on the true-crime podcasting industry and the world of entertainment. 
As Longoria dips her toe back into performing with Only Murders, she’s developed an itch that might be unscratchable. Longoria told Entertainment Tonight that she “misses Wisteria Lane,” referring to her time on ABC’s long-running dramedy Desperate Housewives, and that she’s approached show creator Marc Cherry “a hundred times” about rebooting the primetime soap, but with zero luck so far. 
Meanwhile, the timeline is ripe with new hilarious tweets to dig into. Today’s funniest include those about the best time to apply for jobs, a different name for beef jerky and computer karma.
