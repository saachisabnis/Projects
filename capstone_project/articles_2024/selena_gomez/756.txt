Selena Gomez made a magical return to the world of "Wizards of Waverly Place" in the official reboot trailer, "Wizards Beyond Waverly Place" released on Tuesday (September 24). 
The long-awaited trailer, featuring a few cast members from the original series including Selena (Alex Russo) and David Henrie (Justin Russo), shines a mystical spotlight on new wizard Billie, played by Janice LeAnn Brown. 
In the teaser, the beloved Russo siblings attempt to keep Billie's magic in check while teaching her some tips they learned simply from being a Russo in "Wizards of Waverly Place," which ran from 2007 to 2012. The fate of the Wizard World lies in Billie's hands as she messes with the balance of things, takes control of her wand, and quickly picks up on the fact that everything is not what it seems. 
Accompanied by yet another all-star cast, the young wizard will join the Russo family in taking on a handful of mischief-fueled trials as she navigates life with supernatural powers. 
Per Disney Channel's official summary:  
Fans can catch the highly-anticipated series premiere on October 29th via Disney Channel and Disney+ the very next day!
