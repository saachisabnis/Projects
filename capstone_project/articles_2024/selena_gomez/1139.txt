If you wore makeup in the 2000's there are probably a few products that would instantly take you back. 
Let's be honest, before the YouTube 'beauty gurus' of the 2010's opened our eyes to the best products and how to use them, we had to make do with what we had. This included trips to Boots and copying the makeup looks we saw in magazines. 
I had a think back to some of the beauty products I grew up using and some of them I'd still recommend to this day.

Originally released in 2004, this Lip Glaze was my favourite. With a proper brush applicator, it felt so professional to reapply this when out and about. Now, the brand have re-released the product in 11 modern shades (compared to the frosty pinks and pale shades of the 2000s) - still a product I would add to my makeup bag.
The Great Lash was without a doubt the most popular mascara of the era. Despite launching in 1977, this Maybelline classic was most 2000s kids' first makeup purchase and I definitely remember layering it on for half an hour in front of the mirror. 
First launching in 2005, this face powder was my first introduction to highlighter and the world had a particular obsession with the shade 'Soft and Gentle' right through to the 2010s. Still available to purchase, this product has a "77-mineral complex" that adds a natural looking highlight to the face and body.
