A-list stars like Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift, they’re just like us. They go to football games, gossip with their girlfriends, and can’t help but indulge in reality TV. Seriously, it’s what keeps them relatable. Well, until you remember that they fly on private jets, own multiple houses, and galavant all over the world like they own it. It’s fun to pretend we’re all on the same level. 
Any major fan of Taylor or Selena probably wonders what shows the stars watch in their free time. We’re not talking about the shows they’re involved with or impressed to brag about watching. No – we want to know the trash they binge for hours on the couch with no remorse. Now, thanks to a new interview with Selena, we can confirm that the A-list BFF duo are just as obsessed with Vanderpump Rules as the rest of us. How refreshing. 
Selena recently chatted about her friendship with Taylor in her cover story for Vanity Fair. She bragged about Taylor being a “big sister” figure who provides advice on the music industry and fame. While that’s all fun and good, Selena admitted that most of the time, they’re texting gossip or recapping episodes of Pump Rules. 
“I’m on The Valley now,” Selena said in the interview. “I’ve watched every episode of Vanderpump, so I don’t care if it’s bad!” Girl, we all love The Valley, no shame. We would kill to see the texts between Taylor and Selena regarding Jax Taylor, Kristen Doute, and all of the other wild VPR stars over the years. Like any fan, we’re sure these two have plenty of strong opinions about it all. 
TELL US – ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT TAYLOR SWIFT AND SELENA GOMEZ WATCH VANDERPUMP RULES? WHO DO YOU THINK ARE THEIR FAVORITE VPR STARS TO GOSSIP ABOUT VIA TEXT?
