The 76th Emmy Awards are now in full swing with the TV Academy’s second 2024 ceremony. That’s right. 
After the 2023 Hollywood strikes, the 75th Emmy Awards last aired (late) in January 2023, and they’re at it again, this time on schedule. Finally, Selena Gomez has been nominated for her role in Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building, and hopefully, she will fare better than how the TV Academy  handled Rhea Seehorn‘s Better Call Saul talents earlier this year.
Whether you’re streaming the awards or simply surfing the web, we will keep you updated here on the winners as the show progresses.
Below, you can find the full list of winners in reverse order of announcement, with the winner listed first in bold.
