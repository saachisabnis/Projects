Selena Gomez is "so proud" of her boyfriend Benny Blanco and the launch of his brand new cookbook.
The Rare Beauty founder took to her Instagram on Tuesday (April 30) to celebrate the release of her boyfriend's debut cookbook Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends, sharing snaps from book release, including a cake decorated like the book and a sweet photo of the couple sharing an embrace. In the pic, the "Love On" singer can be seen in a black dress with white polka dots sharing a smile as Blanco wraps his arms around her waist. 
"So proud of @itsbennyblanco — Open Wide is out now!!!" she captioned the pics.
Blanco also popped up in the comments of her post to share his own loving message, telling his girlfriend that "life is better when i'm w u."
The music producer recently showed off his skills in the kitchen when he cooked up a delicious steak meal for his girlfriend, documenting the process on his Instagram. However, when he arrived at her home to surprise her, he found her taking a nap. Rather than waking her from her slumber, he left her a romantic, handwritten note that she discovered when she woke up and subsequently swooned over on her own Instagram Stories.
Gomez and Blanco have reportedly been dating since last summer but have known each other for years. The Wizards of Waverly Place star confirmed their romance in December, writing, "He is my absolute everything in my heart," and adding that he's "the best thing that's ever happened to me."
Since the pair went official with their romance, they have not shied away from expressing their love for each other, sharing sweet backstage photos from awards shows as well as cuddly mornings in bed together. In March, Gomez shared a heartfelt tribute to her boyfriend for his birthday, praising her "love" alongside several PDA-packed pics.
