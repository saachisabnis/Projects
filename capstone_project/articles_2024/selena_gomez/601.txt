Selena Gomez felt "scared to leave the house" after releasing her 2022 documentary.
Selena Gomez has recalled feeling scared to leave her house
The 32-year-old actress has revealed that she actually had second thoughts about releasing 'My Mind and Me' just a few weeks before it was due to launch.
Selena - who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder - told Vanity Fair magazine: "I asked my team if it was possible to pull out.
"Lawyers got involved, but we never took it to Apple because everything was locked … When the movie came out, I didn’t look at anything for a few days, and then I was scared to leave the house."
The brunette beauty felt terrified about sharing her personal struggles with the world. But ultimately, she found comfort in the support and empathy of her fans.

Selena shared: "I just started to embrace it and I felt like it was a really good thing."

Despite this, Selena insists she doesn't want anyone to feel sorry for her.

The 'Only Murders in the Building' star said: "I like to remind people that that is definitely nowhere close to where I am now. 

"My mind was not right and chemically imbalanced, and it was really difficult. People were calling me a victim. That frustrates me, because being vulnerable is actually one of the strongest things you can do. That narrative is not going to take over my life." 

Selena still experiences difficult days from time to time. But the chart-topping star acknowledges that she's "no victim".

She said: "I’m grateful every day. And I have my days like everyone else, but I’m no victim. I just survived a lot. There isn’t a part of me that wants anyone to feel sorry for me."
