Selena Gomez hopes to have the same spirit as Meryl Streep does decades into her career.
In a new interview with Elle, the Rare Beauty founder raved over her Only Murders in the Building co-star, touting Streep's professionalism and support of her fellow actors on set, per People. The Academy Award winner joined the hit Hulu series for season three, joining the star-studded cast including Martin Short and Steve Martin. 
"I remember being on set with Meryl Streep, trying to shoot her side so that she could go home and have the next day off. Toward the end of the day, she said, 'Wait, no, why aren't we turning around?' And they said, 'Oh, we'll do that tomorrow.' And she goes, 'No, no, I must come in, I should be here for them."
The "Love On" singer gushed over Streep's show of support for her co-stars, calling her "classy" for wanting to be there for them. She also praised the Mamma Mia! star for her obvious love for acting. 
"It was so classy and showed that she really still loved the craft and that she wanted to be there for us too," she said, sharing a story about how Streep clearly enjoyed being on set. "I'll never forget her being barefoot, singing on set, just loving what she's doing. I want that spirit, I want to always love what I do and be there for people."
