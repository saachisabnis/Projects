Selena Gomez had serious plans to create a family for herself prior to sparking a romance with boyfriend Benny Blanco, revealing that she was ready to become a single mom and adopt when she turned 35.
The "Love On" singer, 31, made the revelation in a cover story for TIME100 on Wednesday (May 29), saying that her plans were a result of her getting "really used to" being single after not dating for five years, per Billboard. 
"A lot of people are afraid of being alone and I probably tortured myself in my head for like two years being alone," she said. "Then I kind of accepted it."
It was this acceptance that led The Wizards of Waverly Place actress to explore how she could follow through with her plans to start a family without necessarily needing a partner.
"Then I came up with my plan, which was I was going to adopt at 35 if I had not met anyone," she said.
The Rare Beauty founder did eventually meet someone, confirming her relationship with the music producer in December by saying he is "my absolute everything in my heart." In a recent radio interview, Blanco shared that the couple are preparing to celebrating their first anniversary together and even opened about the possibility of marriage and having kids together, calling it the "next goal."
In her new interview, Gomez also shared more details about how she and Blanco transitioned from musical collaborators and friends into something more, revealing that it wasn't until she asked him to set her up with someone that she realized her true feelings for him.
"It just happens when you least expect it," she said. "I just cherish every moment with him. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that he's not going anywhere any time soon."
