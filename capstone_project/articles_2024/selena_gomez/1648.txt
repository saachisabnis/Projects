Selena Gomez shared in a Vanity Fair interview that her chronic health issues, including lupus, a kidney transplant, and chemotherapy, make it dangerous for her to have children. “I haven’t ever said this but I unfortunately can’t carry my own children,” Gomez shared. “I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while.” She emphasized her gratitude for the possibilities of surrogacy or adoption, stating that she is in a “much better place” about the situation. She noted that her own mother was adopted, and believes the method of becoming a mother is less important than the fact that “it’ll be my baby.” (NBC News)
