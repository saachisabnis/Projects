“Only Murders In The Building” star Selena Gomez is now confirmed to be playing legendary singer Linda Ronstadt in an upcoming biopic reports Rolling Stone.
The project, first rumored mid last year, is currently in pre-production and will be based on the singer’s 2013 memoir “Simple Dreams”.
Gomez posted a photo of the memoir as an Instagram Story today with the magazine subsequently confirming the casting. Both Gomez and Ronstadt are of Mexican descent and Gomez has had her own successful music career in addition to acting.
No other cast is attached at this time. James Keach (“Linda and the Mockingbirds”) and Ronstadt’s manager John Boylan are co-producing with no release date revealed.
In her time Ronstadt earned eleven Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, and an Emmy.  Many of her 24 studio albums have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum in the United States and internationally.
Her most famous songs include the likes of “You’re No Good,” “Blue Bayou,” “Don’t Know Much,” “Different Drum,” and “Long, Long Time” which has recently seen a resurgence thanks to its use in the most acclaimed episode (which has the same title) of the first season of HBO’s “The Last of Us”.
Ronstadt retired in 2012 due to a degenerative disease similar to Parkinson’s that has left her unable to sing.
