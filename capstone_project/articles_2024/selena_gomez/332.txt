(Stacker) - There’s no better time to binge-watch TV than in the dead of winter, when the weather is less than ideal and the couch is extra inviting. Thankfully, there’s a seemingly endless supply of series to stream, with newcomers popping up every week and old favorites getting added to platforms daily.
Of course, that also means it can be challenging to sift through all the options—and the many streaming platforms. To help, Stacker compiled a list of the 50 most popular TV shows to stream right now across all platforms, using data from Reelgood as of Jan. 31, 2024. IMDb ratings and other data points were added for supplementary insights.
The top 50 range in genre from sci-fi to comedy, reality to horror. However, the top 10 have one thing in common: They’re all dramas, albeit of varying kinds. One favorite making the cut is “The Bear,” which took home 10 Emmys in January, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Jeremy Allen White, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Ayo Edebiri. Those wins have translated to viewers newly discovering and revisiting the critically acclaimed FX series, which now streams exclusively on Hulu. Its second season debuted in June 2023 and it’s since been renewed for a third, which will air sometime later this year.
New seasons of other gems that have made long-awaited returns are also climbing up the ranks on Hulu. Fans are rediscovering “Fargo,” which came back for its fifth season in November 2023, three years after the fourth came out. The second season of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series “Feud” premiered on Jan. 31—nearly seven years after the first, which focused on the infamous Hollywood rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. The second season, which is also gaining popularity, centers around the true story of writer Truman Capote and his high-society friends known as the Swans.
We won’t spoil every series that cracked the top 10 most watched TV shows across all streaming platforms, but here’s a hint: The #1 spot belongs to a breakout series that just premiered and is already blowing up. Keep reading to find out the drama that’s reigning supreme and to see all the shows that made the list—you might just find your next binge-watch.
