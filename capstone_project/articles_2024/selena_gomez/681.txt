cryptic message
The internet's latest theory stars Justin Bieber and his alleged cryptic message to his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez following her engagement to music producer Benny Blanco. After Gomez, 31, shared the exciting news on social media, revealing glimpses of the romantic proposal and receiving an outpouring of congratulatory messages from celebrity friends like Taylor Swift, Cardi B, and Jennifer Aniston, it's Justin's recent Instagram activity that has fans raising eyebrows.  
On Monday, the "Peaches" singer posted a sweet selfie featuring his wife, Hailey Bieber, kissing his cheek during their trip to Costa Rica. Yet, it wasn't the photo that caught fans' attention — it was the song he paired with the post: Lizzy McAlpine's "All My Ghosts."  
The emotional ballad, which reflects on lingering memories of an ex, features lyrics that fans quickly dissected for hidden meaning. Lines like "I can see it now, the wedding of the year" and "When all my ghosts disappear" made some wonder if Justin, 30, was subtly addressing Selena's engagement. Another poignant lyric, "Oh, all my ghosts are with me / I know you feel them too," fueled the theory that the song choice was deliberate.  
Now, insiders have revealed to DailyMail.com that even though Justin is happily focused on his life with Hailey and their baby son, Jack, Selena's engagement still made him pause and reflect.  
"Justin is married and has a kid, we all know that, but when he heard that Selena was engaged, he'll even admit, it stung for a brief second," the source explained. "Because even though they will never be friends or date again or anything like that, it is officially the end of an era."  
Justin and Selena's history dates back to 2009 when sparks first flew as Justin serenaded her with his song "One Less Lonely Girl" during Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. Their relationship was a rollercoaster of highs and lows in the following years.  
The pair denied romance rumors throughout 2010; however, by late 2010, they were attending red-carpet events together, officially confirming their relationship.  
According to the Daily Mail, their first major breakup came in April 2014 when Selena reportedly found texts and photos from Kylie Jenner on Justin's phone. Months later, they reunited, with Justin sharing a heartfelt Instagram post that read, "Our love is unconditional."  
But their reunion was short-lived. By October 2014, the two had split again. In October 2017, rumors of a rekindled romance swirled as Justin and Selena were spotted grabbing breakfast and attending church services together, but by March 2018, the couple had called it quits for good.  
The source explained, "His past is so connected with Selena, and now that she is engaged, he is married and a father, it's a bit of a shock to the system that everyone is getting older. Justin is only 30, but he has lived a life, and an important part of his past is now officially moved on, just as much as he has moved on."  
Just six months after his final split with Selena, Justin and Hailey tied the knot in September 2018. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024.  
Following years of speculation about a feud between Hailey and Selena and fan calls for Justin and Selena to reunite, the source revealed that Justin hopes the constant online chatter can finally end.  
"He won't be stressing much about it and hopes that she is well and happy at the end of the day," the insider added.  
Meanwhile, Selena is basking in her engagement joy. Her post announcing the proposal with Benny Blanco was flooded with love from her friends and fans alike. Hailey Bieber's subtle gesture of liking Selena's engagement post also caught fans' attention, signaling continued efforts to move past the drama that has long surrounded their intertwined histories.  
Now a father and devoted husband, Justin seems ready to fully embrace his present, while Selena starts an exciting new chapter with Benny.
