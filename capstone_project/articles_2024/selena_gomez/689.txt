Selena Gomez, the ever-talented 31-year-old entertainer, has gifted her fans with a delightful surprise—a brand new single titled “Love On,” accompanied by a captivating music video. This latest release comes six months after her previous track, “Single Soon,” and promises a fresh perspective on the themes of love and romance.
In “Love On,” Selena’s melodic voice carries the essence of the romance of the Parisian lifestyle, coupled with the excitement of experiencing a new love. The track, a product of inspiration drawn from her time spent in Paris in 2023, is a melodic journey through the city of love, encapsulating the thrill of a blossoming romance.
Produced by The Monsters & Strangerz and Isaiah Tejada, the collaboration with The Monsters & Strangerz adds another gem to their joint discography, which includes hits like “Forget Forever,” “Vulnerable,” and “My Mind & Me.” Selena’s music, once again, proves to be a harmonious blend of catchy pop tunes and meaningful lyrics.
Adding to the excitement surrounding the new single is Selena’s openness about her current romantic relationship with Benny Blanco. The Rare Beauty founder couldn’t contain her happiness as she shared insights during a recent interview about “Love On.”
In discussing her relationship with Benny Blanco, Selena expressed the significance of mutual respect and understanding, stating, “Without getting into too much detail, I think it’s just really important to meet someone that respects you. And I think it’s really nice to also lean on someone who understands the world that I live in. But I’d have to say overall it’s the safest that I feel, and it’s been really lovely, and I’ve only grown through it, so it’s awesome.”
Selena’s happiness isn’t just confined to her personal life; it radiates through her music. In discussing the inspiration behind “Love On,” she shared, “The idea is that I was inspired a lot by living in Paris, that for two months I had to work there and I loved just the quality of life and how romantic it felt. And then to kind of feel really happy in my life and actually mean it is so, it’s just like you can tell in my video, I’m just smiling the whole time. It’s such a good feeling.”
She went on, “It’s really, really great. No, I was absolutely able to live life freely and I felt, even though I was single then I felt like it was one of the most romantic cities and just everything from walking down the street to a little cafe, it can be really sweet.”
Check out the “Love On” lyrics below…
[Intro]
Qu’est-ce que je vais te nommer ?
Je vais te nommer “L’amour”
“L’amour tendre”
[Chorus]
Wait ’til I turn my love on
Wait ’til, wait ’til
Wait ’til I turn my love on
I’m no cheap thrill
I’m a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
‘Cause, baby, if you can’t tell (Baby, if you can’t tell)
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
[Verse 1]
This doesn’t have to be some sort of mathematical equation
Slip off your jeans, slide in the sheets
Screaming “yes” in quotations
Clock in, baby, get to work
Night shift, but with all the perks
Time stamping when you fell in love
Time can’t mess with us
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, if you think about fallin’
Got you covered like garments
Ooh, I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late ’til you can’t see straight
Just wait, woo!
[Chorus]
Wait ’til I turn my love on
Wait ’til, wait ’til
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
I’m no cheap thrill
I’m a roller coaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
‘Cause, baby, if you can’t tell (Baby, if you can’t tell)
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
Wait ’til, wait ’til
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
You’ll get your thrill
Just promise you’ll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
‘Cause, baby, if you can’t tell (Baby, if you can’t tell)
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
[Verse 2]
Why are we conversing over this steak tartare
When we could be somewhere other than here
Making out in the back of a car?
Or in the back of a bar
Or we could make a memoir, yeah
On the back wall of the last stall
In the bathroom at The Bazaar
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, if you think about fallin’
Got you covered like garments (I got you covered)
Ooh, I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late ’til you can’t see straight
Just wait, woo!
[Chorus]
Wait ’til I turn my love on
Wait ’til, wait ’til
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
I’m no cheap thrill
I’m a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
‘Cause, baby, if you can’t tell (Baby, if you can’t tell)
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
Wait ’til, wait ’til
Wait ’til I turn my love on (Wait ’til I turn my love on)
You’ll get your thrill
Just promise you’ll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
‘Cause, baby, if you can’t tell (Baby, if you can’t tell)
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
[Outro]
Wait ’til I, oh, yeah
Wait ’til I
Baby, if you can’t tell
You’re what I wanna love on, oh
