Celebrities have teams of stylists who work on their work wardrobes, whether that’s weeks of negotiations to secure a red-carpet gown or borrowing looks straight from the runway for interviews and public appearances. Of course, personal stylists still often play a role in off-duty wardrobes too, however it’s not all luxury samples and fine jewellery.
There are several affordable brands that you’ll see celebrities wearing day in, day out – and certain stars are known for always having a curated high-low mix. Sienna Miller and Katie Holmes are two that come to mind, as they are often spotted wearing casual staples by the likes of Mango, Sézane and Everlane. On the jewellery front, Missoma and Mejuri are cult favourites among the It-crowd, both of which specialise in versatile everyday pieces.
When it comes to footwear, the likes of Vagabond and Birkenstock take pride of place in famous wardrobes – the latter have become a cult item among celebrities and regular folk alike – while dress-wise, Reformation and Rat & Boa have been packed for many a sun-soaked holiday. (London-based sunglasses brand Dmy Studios has also become a spring/summer go-to.)
The best affordable brands to consider adding to cart are those that provide a balance of comfort and style. Most importantly, to ensure maximum wear, an affordable product must fit seamlessly into your wardrobe – in short, only invest in something you can see yourself wearing beyond a single season.
Scroll on for a lowdown on these brands – and the best pieces to shop now.
Cos has long specialised in minimalist staples – but in recent years, it’s broadened its offering to include pops of colour and patterns. Celebrities and Vogue editors alike have fallen for the appeal of the brand’s swaddling outerwear and selection of everyday accessories.
