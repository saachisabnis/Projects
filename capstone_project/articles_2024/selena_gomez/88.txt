Ryan Reynolds is defending comedic acting as a “very difficult” craft after a social media user appeared to question why the actor was included in Variety‘s “Actors on Actors” series.
“Andrew Garfield talking about playing a husband and father [whose] wife decides to forgo cancer treatment and Ryan Reynolds talking about playing Deadpool,” an X user wrote in a since-deleted comment, per Variety, in which they also shared the full list of pairings for the outlet’s December installment of the series.
In response, Reynolds, 48, penned a lengthy message about the similarities and differences between comedic and dramatic acting, beginning by applauding Garfield, 41, and Florence Pugh for their performances in We Live in Time.
“Correct. Andrew’s a genius. He and Florence are magic together in WE LIVE IN TIME. They’re heartbreaking and charming and spend the entire film in a high-wire act of humanity and constraint,” Reynolds wrote. “And yes I am Deadpool BUT I will take a second and speak up in defense of comedy. Dramatic work is difficult. And we’re also meant to SEE it’s difficult which is one of the reasons it feels visceral and effective.”
He continued, “Comedy is also very difficult. But has an added dimension in that it’s meant to look and feel effortless. You intentionally hide the stitching and unstitching. I think both disciplines are beautiful. And both work beautifully together. Comedy and drama subsist on tension. Both thrive when subverting expectation. Both thrive backstopped by real emotion. And both are deeply subjective. Your favourite comedy might be Anchorman. Mine might be Lars von Trier’s Melancholia.”
Social media users applauded Reynolds’ statement, with one writing, “Yes! This is why I love comedy. It’s a discipline that requires so much thinking, and yet it comes out as the total opposite. Drama is also amazing, but there can be even more drama in a comedic performance when done right.”
Another said, “As someone who is a lover of comedy more than dramas, I agree, both deserve respect.”
Reynolds and Garfield’s interview will be the first of Variety‘s new season of “Actors on Actors.” Other pairings include Ariana Grande and Paul Mescal, Nicole Kidman and Zendaya, Saoirse Ronan and Selena Gomez, Angelina Jolie and Cynthia Erivo and more.

In November, Reynolds revealed that he and Jackman, 56, along with Deadpool 3 director Shawn Levy, would be teaming up again for a new movie he’s “writing for himself, Hugh and Shawn to do that is not Marvel.” Reynolds and Levy, 56, previously worked on the movies Free Guy and The Adam Project.
