The 2024 Emmy Awards, a year of television history in the making, not only showcased exceptional talent but also sparked controversy and shocking moments that left audiences stunned.
The prestigious event honours the best in television, spanning artistic talent to the technical mastery behind the scenes. Among various Emmy ceremonies, the prime time awards night stands out as the most anticipated television event of the year.
Beyond the accolades, the Emmys are notorious for unscripted speeches and unexpected red carpet antics that provide a dose of drama and bold declarations. We've compiled a list of standout moments from this year's show that you might have missed.
Constrained by her figure-hugging attire, Quinta Brunson was limited to taking tiny steps and could only strike certain poses. Despite this, photographers were eager to snap every aspect of her stunning floor-length dress.
The star had to firmly inform one insistent photographer who wanted her to look back over her shoulder, "boy, bye."
She explained, "Can't do it as I walk you guys, I wish I could," and in another instance remarked, "Can't sorry."
D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, from the hit series Reservation Dogs, made a powerful statement on the red carpet sporting a bloody handprint across his face. The stark symbol served as a shocking reminder of the silenced voices and shines light on the alarming statistic that Native American women are up to 10 times more likely to be murdered or sexually assaulted than other demographic groups.
This epidemic is rooted in complex issues like colonialism, historical trauma, racial discrimination, and the sexual objectification of Indigenous women.
Meanwhile, Selena Gomez threw shade at presidential contender Donald Trump and his ally JD Vance during an appearance, poking fun at herself and her co-stars as "childless cat ladies."
The sarcastic remark was seen as a clapback to Vance's contentious commentary concerning Democrats. In a previously televised conversation with former Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson in 2021, Vance had taken aim at Democratic leadership and lashed out at perceived critics, which he described as, including corporate heads and "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."
Candice Bergen didn't mince her words when she reminisced about a memorable Murphy Brown episode, saying, "In one classic moment, my character was attacked by Vice President Dan Quayle when Murphy became pregnant and decided to raise the baby as a single mother. Oh, how far we've come. Today a Republican candidate for vice president would never attack a woman for having kids. So as they say, my work here is done. Meow."
RuPaul's Drag Race has been left in the dust after The Traitors snatched victory from its grasp in the cutthroat reality TV category. Despite RuPaul's Drag Race bagging an impressive 27 Primetime Emmy Awards since it first sashayed onto our screens in 2009, The Traitors have now stolen the spotlight, leaving RuPaul and other contenders like The Amazing Race, Top Chef, and The Voice trailing behind.
Hacks has delivered a knockout blow to The Bear, seizing the title of Best Comedy, while Jean Smart dazzled with her win for Best Actress in a Comedy. This comes after The Bear had initially seemed to dominate the competition with Jeremy Allen White, Liza Colon-Zayas, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach all securing early wins.
