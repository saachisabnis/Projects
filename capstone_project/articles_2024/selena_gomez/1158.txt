Selena Gomez will play folk singer Linda Ronstadt in an upcoming biopic, Variety and Rolling Stone report. Gomez teased her role earlier this week when she posted a picture of Ronstadt’s 2013 memoir Simple Dreams on her Instagram story. Similarly, Ronstadt has shared news reports of Gomez's casting announcement on social media. 
          

            John Boylan, will produce the movie alongside James Keach, who produced the 2019 documentary Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice and directed 2020’s Linda and the Mockingbirds.
          

            Gomez, like Ronstadt, is an American singer of Mexican descent. In addition to music she has starred in movies including Spring Breakers and can currently be seen alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short on the hit series Only Murders In The Building. No other casting has been announced for the Ronstadt biopic. 
          

            Ronstadt retired from performing in 2011 due to her progressive supranuclear palsy, which was originally mistaken for Parkinson’s.
