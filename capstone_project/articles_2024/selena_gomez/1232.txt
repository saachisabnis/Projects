Gomez shared the news Jan. 18 in an Instagram Story, writing that she was "so excited." She followed up by adding: "We're back," over an old photo of her and Henrie's characters in their fictional family's living room. 
The spinoff comes from writers and producers Jed Elinoff and Scott Thomas, the creators of "Raven's Home"—the sequel series to Raven Symoné's "That's So Raven." It will bring on new cast members including "Euphoria" star Janice LeAnn Brown, "Call Me Kat" star Alkaio Thiele and "Rutherford Falls" cast member Mimi Gianopulos.
