Selena Gomez was already having a pretty great week, but it just got even better: She’s engaged.
On Instagram, Selena showed off the marquise cut diamond ring from boyfriend Benny Blanco, along with a picture of them embracing, and captioned the pic, “forever begins now..”
One of Selena’s BFFs Taylor Swift commented, “yes I will be the flower girl,” while Benny wrote, “hey wait … that’s my wife.” The account for Hulu, which streams Selena’s show Only Murders in the Building, commented, “we’re crying.”
Selena and Benny, born Benjamin Levin, have known each other for years and have collaborated musically. They began dating in 2023, and in December, she confirmed their relationship on social media, calling the songwriter and producer “my absolute everything.” 
As previously reported, this week, Selena received two Golden Globe nominations: one for her role in Only Murders and another for her role in the Netflix film Emilia Pérez.
