As tumultuous as this awards season has been for “Emilia Pérez,” the one constant is Zoe Saldaña winning every single Best Supporting Actress trophy at the televised award shows. One could argue that the whole Karla Sofía Gascón tweet scandal even worked to her benefit, as the greater criticisms of the Netflix film became the Best Actress nominee’s to really shoulder.

Meanwhile Saldaña has had more space to talk about herself, and what the honor would mean to her. Ultimately, her narrative is not dissimilar to Best Actress favorite Demi Moore, in that her films have even more so been box office draws, yet she has not gotten much credit for her artistic prowess until last year with the role of Rita, which required the most singing and dancing of any “Emilia Pérez” leads. Worth noting too that she would be the first Latina star to win Best Supporting Actress for a role other than Anita in “West Side Story.”
Ariana Grande, another musical star, has put up a great campaign, but ultimately voters don’t quite know what to do with “Wicked” being two parts. Fans of the stage musical know that what is in store for her character Glinda in “Wicked: For Good” should be an even bigger showcase of her acting talent. So there’s always next year.
Again, this is a category that feels pretty easy to call already, but if one nominee has become ascendant since voting began, it is “Conclave” star Isabella Rossellini. Though her role as a nun in the papal election drama is brief, she is quite memorable. And given her pedigree, and history with some of the most iconic filmmakers of all time, it is a big surprise that this is only her first nomination. With more awards results showing “Conclave” is popular among Academy voters, it feels fair to consider her a dark horse.
For “A Complete Unknown” star Monica Barbaro and “The Brutalist” star Felicity Jones, the wind has been knocked out of their sails a bit, as their films haven’t been as dominant as previously expected, based on all their Oscar nominations. Still, this is both their second films to be nominated for Best Picture, so it does seem like they have the right taste in projects to find their way back to the Academy Awards as a nominee again.
