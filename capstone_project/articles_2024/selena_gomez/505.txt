Compiled by Fionnuala Halligan.
Wild DiamondDir. Agathe RiedingerOur critic said: “The feisty restlessness of Agathe Riedinger’s impressive feature debut belies the profound sadness of its central theme – that for many young women, beauty and pain are one and the same.”International sales: Pyramide International  Read the review

Sean Baker at the Cannes Film Festival closing ceremony
Anora (Palme d’Or)Dir. Sean BakerOur critic said: “A wildly entertaining, modern-day screwball comedy set in 2018 that barrels through New York and Las Vegas.”International sales: Filmnation EntertainmentRead the review   
All We Can Imagine As Light (Grand Prix)Dir. Payal KapadiaOur critic said: “Arthouse audiences should respond to the opportunity to follow this beautifully-shot, gentle story.”International sales: Luxbox FilmsRead the review

The Seed Of The Sacred Fig (special award)Dir. Mohammad RasoulofOur critic said: “As an impassioned outcry against oppression, and a depiction of how a new generation – notably female – is challenging a long-entrenched status quo, the film is essential watching.”International sales:  Films BoutiqueRead the review

Emilia Perez (best actress, shared among the cast)Dir. Jacques AudiardOur critic said: “Transgender Spanish star Gascon, playing both Manitas and Emilia, is the film’s bedrock.

The Story Of Souleymane (Jury Prize/best actor, Abou Sangare)Dir. Boris LojkineOur critic said: “Non-professional Sangare is magnetic throughout, whether on the saddle or an interview hot seat.”International sales: PyramideRead the review  
The Damned (best director ex-aqueo)Dir. Roberto MinerviniOur critic said: “The unvarnished naturalism and unpolished dialogue – there is nothing here that feels scripted or artificial – comes as close, one imagines, to the realities of military life in 1862 America as it is possible to get.”International sales: Les Filmes Du LosangeRead the review  
On Becoming A Guinea Fowl (best director ex-aqueo)Dir. Rungano NyoniOur critic said: “A formally daring picture that blends fantasy, stylised drama and elements of black comedy to explore the societal pressures that rewrite the truth.”International sales: A24Read the review  
The Shameless (best actress, Anasuya Sengupta)Dir. Konstantin BojanovOur critic said: “Sengupta is never less than compelling in her first screen role. Her background is in production design but she proves equally capable of crafting a believable character.”International sales: Urban Group  Read the review

Universal Language (audience award)Dir. Matthew RankinOur critic said: “While this lightly comic caper is a pleasing homage to beloved Iranian cinema, set in the snowy-beige anonymity of Winnipeg, it also owes a deep aesthetic debt to the deliberate mise-en-scene of Wes Anderson.”International sales: Best Friend Forever  Read the review  
The Other Way Around (Europa Cinemas Label)Dir. Jonas TruebaOur critic said: “Trueba continues to satisfy film buffs with plenty of fun self-referential elements, designed to appeal to purists.”International sales: Memento InternationalRead the review

Baby (acting prize, Ricardo Teodoro)Dir. Marcelo CaetanoOur critic said: “A tenderhearted, quietly affirmative take on a teenage boy’s search for family that is largely set on the mean streets of Sao Paolo.”International sales: M-AppealRead the review
