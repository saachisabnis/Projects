	If that’s not enough, this blender is also easy to clean, making your post-prep routine quick and hassle-free. For quick cleaning, the brand recommends filling out the container with water, adding a drop of soap, blending it up for 60 seconds, and then dumping and rinsing it out.  

	According to the brand, this blender fits perfectly underneath cabinets. So, you don’t have to worry about it taking up space in your kitchen. 

	If you’re still indecisive, take a look at the reviews. A Vitamix customer said, “I received my Vitamix in December 2021 (Lemon Cream). I don’t know what took me so long to order one. I am very pleased with everything about it. The speed in which it works amazes me every time. If you’ve been waiting to purchase stop waiting and buy it now. It’s worth the money.”

	Another customer said, “I’ve made broccoli cheese soup—luscious and creamy. The potato bacon cheese soup is amazing… green smoothie tastes exactly like Smoothie King at a fraction of the cost. I leave mine on counter because we use it daily and it’s so clean and classy looking.”
