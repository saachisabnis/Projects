The 35-year-old sports star - who has been dating Taylor Swift since 2023 - has taken to social media to offer his congratulations to Hailee and Josh, his NFL rival, after the loved-up couple announced their engagement.
The celebrity duo shared their news via Instagram, posting a photo of Josh proposing to the 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' star by the oceanfront.
In response to the post, Travis - who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL - simply said: "Congratulations!!! [applause emojis] (sic)"
Josh recently inspired his Buffalo Bills team to victory over Travis' Chiefs. But that didn't stop the NFL star from offering his congratulations to Josh and Hailee.

Meanwhile, the actress also has a long-standing relationship with Taylor, Travis' girlfriend.

Hailee, 27, actually starred in the music video for Taylor's hit single 'Bad Blood' back in 2014, and she previously revealed that Taylor personally asked her to appear in the star-studded video, which also featured the likes of Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Zendaya.

Speaking to USA Today in 2015, Hailee shared: "Taylor called me … about the video, and she was like, ‘I’ll send you the treatment and it’ll explain it a lot better, [but] there’s going to be three of you!’ And I was like, ‘That’s going to be awesome. I have no idea what this is, but I obviously trust her and this is going to be amazing'.

"She sets such an incredible example for everyone - let alone just me - that she’s such an inspiration. I really do look up to her as an artist and as a person."
