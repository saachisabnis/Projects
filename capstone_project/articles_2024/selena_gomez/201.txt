Snow isn't the only thing that's glistening for Selena Gomez this year. 
As you know, Selena recently got engaged to her Benny Blanco, and in a new video shared to her Instagram stories, the couple is cozied up together and all smiles, while listening and singing along to Christmas carols. As someone is performing "Winter Wonderland," Gomez mouths along the lyrics, "Sleigh bells ring, are you listening/ In the lane, snow is glistening," while flashing her enormous, sparkling marquise diamond engagement ring.
They're just walkin' in a winter wonderland of love.
Selena shared news of her engagement to Blanco two weeks ago, sharing a closeup photo of her beautiful, and a photo from the proposal, which included a picnic complete with — Selena's favorite — Taco Bell, and champagne. She also shared a photo of Benny wrapping her up in his arms as she smiles big while flashing her new ring. Gomez captioned the post, "forever begins now."
And as her future husband, Benny also commented on the post, writing, "Hey wait… that’s my wife."
Benny gave Selena a beautiful marquise diamond ring with diamonds along the band — the shape of the ring is a callback to Gomez's 2015 song "Good For You," in which she sings, "I'm on my marquise diamonds/ I'm a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous."
