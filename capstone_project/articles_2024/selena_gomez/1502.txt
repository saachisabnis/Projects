Julianne Hough is hitting the promotional circuit for her new book “Everything We Never Knew: A Novel,” and doing so in style.
Getting in on the pointed pumps trend that has been super popular throughout 2024 thus far, the multi-hyphenate showcased a glamorous look in sleek pointed-toe pumps that were designed in a sleek beige color. The shoes were emphasized by a sharp triangular toe box, which is often common with the pointed-toe model. Crafted with sheer material, the shoes were finished with a tall stiletto heel that ranged in-between 4-to-5 inches in height.

 









The dancer teamed her footwear with a satin yellow slip dress, which was paired underneath a matching button-up blouse. As for the rest of her look, Hough kept it simple with dewy makeup, which further complimented her short angular bob.
