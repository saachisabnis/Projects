Unless you’re immune to trendy beauty products, you’ve likely heard of the viral K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask. The fast-acting treatment works so well on reviving damaged hair, it had shoppers ditching Olaplex at one point (and even Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez kept one on hand). The formula penetrates deep into the inner layers of hair to deliver the patented K18PEPTIDE to immediately restore vitality, softness, smoothness and volume to flat tresses. 
If you’re already a fan of the hair mask, you’ll want to add K18’s matching shampoo into your regimen (Bonus: It’s cheaper than the mask). Named the Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo, the formula contains  the same high concentration of amino acid peptides that were carefully designed to nourish and heal your strands with every wash.

Those with extremely damaged, brittle locks will benefit from use the most, since the shampoo is infused with a blend of essential ingredients that target those exact concerns. Salicylic acid, activated charcoal and the brand’s patented K18PEPTIDE absorb toxins, excess oils and dirt from the scalp, reduce keratin loss, and clear sebum build-up to reveal stronger, healthier hair. 
It gently but effectively removes 99 percent of product buildup on your scalp without stripping your hair of its natural oils. Optimized with pH 3.8-4.2, the shampoo will also help maintain your dye jobs without concern. It also combats metals present in tap and hard water that can alter the hue of color-treated hair overtime.
The brand advises swapping out your regular shampoo for this ‘power wash’ at least once a week (or as needed.) All hair types will benefit, since it is capable of removing build-up, resetting texture and enhancing the performance of additional products and stylers (such as the famous K18 Molecular Repair Mask) for anyone who chooses to use it. 
So, what are you waiting for? Grab the Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo from beauty retailer eCosmetics for $38, or opt into the auto replenish program to save 25 percent on all future orders.
