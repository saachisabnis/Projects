Of all the awards Jennifer Lopez could have received at IndieWire Honors, held in Los Angeles December 5, winning the Maverick Award “held a special place” in her heart. In fact, she even looked up the dictionary definition of “maverick,” which she related in her speech accepting the prize.
“I wanted have to the real definition, OK!,” Lopez said. “It means an individualist, a nonconformist, a free spirit, an original, a trendsetter, an eccentric, an outsider, a rebel, a dissident, a disruptor. OK, I could go on, but I’m not going to. But seriously, what a beautiful thing to be recognized for, for charting your own course. I’m appreciative of being seen in that way and recognized for who I am and kind of who I’ve had to be because I think every artist and everyone in this room has had to figure out how to do it their own way, blaze their own trail. So I’m honored to be included among you.”

She joined an august roster of winners, including Selena Gomez, Steve McQueen and Adam Stockhausen, Pamela Anderson, and “Daughters” directors Angela Patton and Natalie Rae.
Lopez’s latest film is “Unstoppable,” in which she plays the real-life Judy Robles, the mother of college wrestling star Anthony Robles, who was born without a leg and went on to win the NCAA Division 1 championship in his weight class as well as multiple Pac-10 championships. In the lead-up to IndieWire Honors, Judy Robles praised Lopez for delving deeply into who she is.
“She could have just read the book,” Robles told IndieWire. “She could have created a character. She could have asked my son a few key points. She could have played this role however she wanted to. But she chose to sit down and talk with me. We met by Zoom for a couple of hours, and then a few times after that, but she was always asking me questions. ‘What about this? How are you like this?'”
Lopez returned the favor at IndieWire Honors, giving extended praise to Robles during her speech.
“Judy represents every mother who sees limitless potential in their child, no matter what the challenges they may face,” Lopez said. “Always emphasizing and focused on Anthony’s strengths and what he does have and can accomplish rather than what he doesn’t. This film teaches us that our true strength lies not in the challenges we face, but in how we overcome them. It’s a beautiful reminder that parents and children can often help each other grow. Portraying Judy and delving into her story has had a profound impact on me, as most creative experiences can. She’s a mother who poured her heart and soul into her children and taught them that nothing was more important than family. She taught them that with love and unyielding determination, any obstacle can be surmounted. Against all odds, she rose above her own adversity, leading by example and demonstrating to her children that they possess the resilience to be unstoppable as well.

 









She continued, “I owe a debt of gratitude to Judy. Her openness in sharing her experiences and wisdom before and during filming work invaluable in bringing this film to life and enriching my own journey as an artist and as a woman and as a mother.”
Lopez also praised her director William Goldenberg and co-star Jharrel Jerome (also an IndieWire Honors alum), who played Anthony Robles, as well as co-stars Bobby Cannavale, Don Cheadle, Michael Peña.
She also shared a special shout-out to entertainment journalism, and its value in fostering and celebrating creativity in the film and TV industries. “A special thanks to the IndieWire team,” Lopez said. “Entertainment journalism holds a crucial place in our industry, shaping narratives, amplifying marginalized voices and guiding audiences discover hidden cinematic gems. Thank you to the entire IndieWire team for their dedicated commitment to uplifting and celebrating the extraordinary talent and innovation that defines our ever-evolving industry.”
