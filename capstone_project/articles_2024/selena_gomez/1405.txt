Some cities just inspire you to dress a certain way, and it’s refreshing to know that celebrities feel similar urges. Take Selena Gomez, who was in Paris this weekend, living it up in front of the Eiffel Tower and feasting on croissants. The singer, who spent 40 hours in the City of Lights ahead of the release of her latest single, “Love On,” which drops later this week, was decked out in top-to-toe black and looking as chic as any Parisienne.
To complete the look, the founder of Rare Beauty naturally chose to lacquer her lips in a fire-engine red, the true hallmark of Gallic insouciance.
It’s highly likely that Gomez was sporting a shade from her wildly successful Lip Souffle collection. Its whipped cream texture and intense pigments mean it’s almost constantly sold out, but if you can get your hands on one, Inspire is a bold and bright red perfect for anyone looking to emulate Gomez’s take on French-girl chic.

In addition to comfort and color, the Lip Souffles also deliver on staying power. Which is just as well for Selena Gomez, who was pictured acting like a true Francophile and dipping her croissant in her coffee, with not a stray lipstick stain in sight. Bravo!
