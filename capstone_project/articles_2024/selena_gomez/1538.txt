Sony has pulled the plug on its new live service game, Concord, announcing "sales will cease immediately"
The game, released on Aug. 23, failed to find its footing after negative reviews and miniscule player numbers. 
After launching, the first-person shooter game failed to reach 25,000 copies sold, according to Esports Illustrated. 
PlayStation announced the news in a blog post on Sep. 3 (Tuesday). 
"Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar," Firewalk Studios game director Ryan Ellis wrote in a statement.

"Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us. However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning Sept. 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players," he added. 
Anyone who purchased the game is eligible to get a full refund.
