Say it with me: We love it when celebrities wear affordable things! (Ahem, especially to fancy award ceremonies.) Selena Gomez, who was nominated for the 2024 Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series for her work in Only Murders in the Building, showed up to the event wearing a gorgeous, custom Armani Priv√© gown paired with an under-$150 dainty purse from JW PEI. And, much to our surprise, it hasn't sold out yet!
The multi-hyphenate was seen wearing the brand's iconic Gabbi Bag‚Äîthat‚Äôs been a hit on Amazon for years now‚Äîin its red crystal style. On JW PEI's site, the bag retails for $129. Not to mention, you can currently snag it for 12% off and receive free shipping. Look how stunning it is: 
Honestly, it's not shocking that Selena Gomez wore this specific accessory considering how much A-listers love JW PEI's Gabbi Bag. Other stars like Emily Ratajkowski and Gigi Hadid have both been spotted rocking the purse. Available in a slew of different bold and neutral colorways, the Gabbi Bag is available on Amazon with Prime shipping. FYI You can actually score most styles of the Gabbi Bag for under $80! Depending on the design, they range from $79.99-$129.00.
The specific bag that Selena wore to the Golden Globes is not available on Amazon at the moment, but you can shop it at JWPEI.com. Hurry up and get to shopping before you can't buy it anywhere!! I already know this is gonna be your new favorite bag...üòè
