Selena Gomez recently shut down rumors that she's had cosmetic surgery in the comment section of a TikTok video speculating the work she's had done in recent years. 
The "Single Soon" hitmaker commented on the post shared by plastic surgeon assistant Marissa Barrionuevo in April 2023, who didn't even attempt to make assumptions about procedures that Gomez has had done. 
"I literally have no idea what she has gotten done. I think she's been through so much in her life, especially medically related, so I don't think it's fair to speculate whether or not she's gotten cosmetic things done. At the end of the day, let's just leave her be."
The video featured two side-by-side photos of Gomez, one from a few years back, and one from 2023 that displayed obvious differences in the star's facial features. 
The Only Murders in the Building standout spoke her peace in the comment section of the video on Saturday (July 27) asking to be left alone while highlighting her distaste for speculation.
"Honestly, I hate this. I was on stripes because of flare up. I have Botox. That's it. Leave me alone." Upon receiving the response, Barrionuevo made a second video on Sunday (July 28) apologizing to Gomez for any offense she took, despite not making any assumptions about Gomez in the first place.
Barrionuevo assured that she meant well and apologized to Gomez once more.
