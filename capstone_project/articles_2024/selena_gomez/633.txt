Selena Gomez is back to promoting music. Teasing her newest single, “Love On,” the singer shared photos from her 40-hour trip to Paris over the weekend, while paparazzi captured her in a stunning evening look. Gomez paired a flirty, black Dior minidress with a matching headscarf for her night out in the French city. She accessorized with Versace leather heels and Messika jewelry. Beauty-wise, she let her red lip be the focal point of her glam.
Gomez shared her own gallery of photos yesterday from her visit. “40 hours. Paris. LOVE ON 2/22 🤍🔒,” she wrote.
In a second Instagram today, she tried her hand at the French language to tease her song. “Qu’est-ce que je vais te nommer? Je vais te nommer. L’amour L’amour tendre. #LoveOn 2.22 ♥️,” she wrote. In English, that translates to: “What am I going to name you? I’m going to name you love. Tender love.” 
Gomez shared what appeared to be two images from her music video shoot given the camera appearing in frame. Her boyfriend, Benny Blanco, commented a heart-eyes emoji on her post.
Gomez teased she had at least one album left in her back in early January when comments she made about focusing only on acting went viral. 
“I do feel like I have one more album in me, but I would probably choose acting [if asked to pick between it and music],” she told Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett on their SmartLess podcast. When they pointed out that she doesn’t need to pick and can do both, she replied, “You’re right, but I am going to want to chill because I’m tired.”
