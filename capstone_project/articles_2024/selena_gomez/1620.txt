Since social media teaches us everything we think we know about the celebrities we love, it’s easy to become invested in each report we see online. As a result, fans cling to often-inaccurate speculation, resulting in the unnecessary act of pitting accomplished women against each other.
In 2023 alone, we saw a handful of women accused of feuding with each other, with the reasoning behind the accusations often based on speculation and rumours. One such instance saw Hailey Bieber accused of mocking Selena Gomez’s eyebrows. Although Gomez and Bieber shut down the feud rumours, they weren’t the only ones pitted against each other in 2023, as Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo and Emily Ratajkowski and Olivia Wilde also faced similar speculation.
