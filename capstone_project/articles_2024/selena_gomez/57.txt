Everyday Guides and Stories on Life's Topics
Everyday Guides and Stories on Life's Topics
Welcome to Noodls – a space created by three editors – each passionate about different aspects of modern life. With a shared vision, we recognized a gap in online content: plenty of information existed, but finding thoughtful, well-researched articles that balanced depth with accessibility was challenging. We met while working at various digital publications. Frustrated by the constraints of corporate content calendars, we decided to build something that reflected our values.
At Noodls.com, we believe in content that serves a purpose. Each article undergoes a collaborative process:
Our editorial calendar isn’t dictated by trending topics but by thoughtful consideration of what matters in health, technology, and lifestyle spheres. When we do cover popular subjects, we strive to provide insights and angles you won’t find elsewhere.
We’re also building tools to make this experience more interactive. For example, our Sleep Health Checker helps readers reflect on their sleep habits with practical tips, while 1 New Thing to Try offers a small, actionable idea with every click – designed to encourage simple lifestyle experiments that make a real difference.
Kyle King, Health & Wellness EditorWith an MS in Nutrition Science from Cornell University and five years as a wellness columnist, Kyle brings evidence-based perspective to health topics.
Lucy Taylor, Lifestyle EditorLucy’s background in cultural anthropology informs their approach to lifestyle topics—examining trends through socio-cultural lenses rather than simply reporting on them. Previously a features writer at a prominent lifestyle publication.
Marcus Johnson, Technology EditorA former software developer turned tech journalist, Marcus has spent a decade translating complex technological concepts into accessible content. His background includes three years as a contributing editor at a tech company.
Although we come from different backgrounds and have different passions, we share one goal—to provide well-written articles and guides that are easy to understand and useful in everyday life.
We understand that being a trusted source requires more than good intentions. That’s why:
Each article and guide we publish goes through a review process. We look at its practicality, relevance to our readers, and the quality of the writing. We don’t want to put out raw or messy content; we aim for clarity, purpose, and readability.
We also believe in giving readers more than just something to read. That’s why we’re building simple tools like the Sleep Health Checker and 1 New Thing to Try—features that encourage self-reflection, promote healthier habits, and invite everyday curiosity.
This website is for everyone. You don’t need to be an expert in any field to read here. Whether you’re a student, a professional, or simply a curious person who loves to learn, you’ll find content that suits you.
We aim to make information accessible. You won’t need deep technical knowledge to understand our articles. Instead, we use clear language, easy-to-follow formats, and real-life examples.
Though we’re just starting out, we have big plans for the future. We’ll continue to expand our range of categories and seek more contributors and experts in different fields. We also hope to build an active community of readers who care about and are engaged in the topics we discuss.
Aside from articles and guides, we’re planning to launch a regular newsletter, make the site more mobile-friendly, and add other features to enhance your experience.
We welcome suggestions, comments, and collaborations. If there’s a topic you want us to cover, or if you have feedback about one of our articles, don’t hesitate to reach out. We want to hear from you!
