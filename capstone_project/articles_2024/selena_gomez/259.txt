Selena Gomez publicly called Benny Blanco the “love of my life” yesterday. Privately, the couple of one year has had more serious discussions, a source told Us Weekly today.
“She and Benny are very serious and have talked about marriage,” the insider said, calling the relationship “definitely endgame [for her]. Selena is really happy and is doing really well. She feels her life is peaceful right now.”
Blanco gave Gomez a particularly grand gesture for her 32nd birthday. The source revealed that he “planned Selena’s entire birthday weekend as a surprise to her and wanted to make her feel extra special this past weekend. He hosted 10 of her closest friends at his Malibu home for a special celebration. Benny went out of his way to get decor and a cake for Selena, and they had a chef prepare an amazing meal for the group.”
Gomez shared some photos from that party on Instagram. “Thank you so much for your birthday wishes!! I’m very grateful and always thankful 🥰 32,” she wrote.
Gomez and Blanco started dating in private last June. Gomez confirmed their relationship in December. She also reacted to Blanco revealing he could see himself marrying Gomez and having a family with her during a May interview. “He can’t lie to save his life,” she told Time. “If he’s asked a question, he’ll answer it.”
She added that she is more guarded with what she’ll share: “I know what people can do to people I love. My own fans, who I adore and feel like have shaped who I am, will say the most hurtful things to me about how I live my life. But he has the strength in him that none of that noise fazes him. It’s really impressive, and I just cherish every moment with him.”
