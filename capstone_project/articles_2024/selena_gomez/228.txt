Cara Delevingne is opening up about what it was like living with her friend Taylor Swift.
The model revealed to comedian Nikki Glaser, 40, in a conversation for Interview on Thursday, November 21 that she had moved in with the “Blank Space” singer after a split with a romantic partner.
“I was going through a really horrible breakup, and she let me live with her,” Delevingne, 32, shared.
Delevingne hinted that their contrasting personalities made for an interesting time together as roommates.
“We’re very different people,” Delevingne said. “She’s very homely, because she looked after me so well, but we got into some — not trouble, but I definitely took her for a bit of a wild ride.”
During the chat for Interview, Delevingne and Glaser also touched on Netflix’s The Roast of Tom Brady — which the comedian hosted.
Glaser admitted she would love to see Swift as a subject for one of the roasts.
“I mean, as a Swiftie, I would love a roast of Taylor Swift,” Glaser told Delevingne. “But I actually wouldn’t because I would be angry if anyone was really mean.”
Delevingne and Swift have long enjoyed a strong friendship, with the model even appearing as one of the singer’s “squad” members in Swift’s music video for “Bad Blood” in 2014.
More recently, Swift was spotted supporting Delevingne in June by flying to the UK to watch her play Sally Bowles in Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club on London’s West End.
“I didn’t know that I could play Sally, let alone wanted to, until the opportunity arose,” Delevingne told Harper’s Bazaar UK of the role in April. “I feel I can put all my pain and fear into the performance. There are so many layers to her. She is extremely powerful, but my God, is she broken and vulnerable. She’s a child — a little girl, and that is the saddest part of it all. I definitely recognize myself in that.”
She continued: “I have never learnt so much, or grown so much. I am taking away so many incredible, valuable things that you cannot get, or even pay for, by doing this job.”

“I’m so, so happy for her,” she told E! News in November 2023.  “I’m always rooting for my girl.”
She added, “There’s definitely something very different about them.”
