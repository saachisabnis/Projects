Here's everything Sabrina Carpenter has said about her new album Short N' Sweet, collabs and all the vinyl variants.
She's working late 'cause she's a singer. Sabrina Carpenter's new album 'Short n' Sweet' is on its way and it's almost here.
After years of hard work, Sabrina Carpenter has officially reached main pop girlie status. Her last album 'Emails I Can't Send' debuted to critical acclaim and it's since spawned two chart smashes: 'Nonsense' and 'Feather'. Not to mention, Sabrina's new singles 'Espresso' and 'Please Please Please' have both hit Number 1 in the UK. It's a great time to be a carpenter.
Now, Sabrina has announced her sixth studio album 'Short n' Sweet' and we're just days away from getting to hear it in full. Here's everything we know about the new project so far including the release date, tracklist, collaborators and more.
Sabrina Carpenter reveals her fave ‚ÄòNonsense‚Äô outro
Sabrina Carpenter is releasing 'Short n' Sweet' on August 23rd. Taking to Instagram on June 3rd, Sabrina shared the cover art and wrote: "‚ÄúShort n‚Äô Sweet‚Äù MY NEW ALBUM IS COMING OUT AUGUST 23rd!!!!üíã this project is quite special to me and i hope it‚Äôll be something special to you too. you can preorder it now!"
She also teased: "i also have a surprise coming for you on thursday night so keep an eye out!!" It has since been revealed that the "surprise" was Sabrina's latest single 'Please Please Please' and her boyfriend Barry Keoghan is in the video.
Sabrina's been quietly working on music since 2023. Speaking to Cosmopolitan in March, Sabrina said: "I‚Äôm trying to really take this experience in before moving on to the next thing‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve been working on the next thing for a minute."
She added: "I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôve outgrown the songs I‚Äôm singing, which is always an exciting feeling because I think that means the next chapter is right around the corner."

You can currently order the album on vinyl, cd and cassette from Sabrina's official store. There are four vinyl variants and a picture disc. The original vinyl comes in a striking blue colour, and the picture disc is a photo of Sabrina in a pink slip with lipstick kisses all over the back. 
There is also a sold out limited edition green Short n' Sweet vinyl, a pink vinyl that's available from Target and independent record stores and a new white vinyl with an alternate cover and an exclusive bonus track: 'Needless to Say'.
Sabrina is also selling an array of exclusive 'Short n' Sweet' merch on her website including short-sleeve tees, long-sleeve tees and hoodies.
Sabrina Carpenter's sixth album 'Short n' Sweet' contains the smash hit 'Espresso' and Sabrina's new single 'Please Please Please' alongside 10 unreleased tracks. There is also a bonus track called 'Needless to Say' on the white vinyl variant. You can presave and preorder the album now.

Sabrina co-wrote 'Espresso' with her longterm collaborators Amy Allen, Steph Jones and Julian Bunetta who've previously worked on her songs including 'Nonsense', 'Feather' and 'Vicious'. Meanwhile, 'Please Please Please' was co-written with Amy Allen and Jack Antonoff. 'Please Please Please' is Sabrina's first time working with Jack on a song.
As for other collaborators on the album, Sabrina's past co-writers Julia Michaels ('Because I Liked a Boy') and John Ryan ('Fast TImes') are also part of the project. Dua Lipa and Selena Gomez producer Ian Kirkpatrick has also joined the fold.

For her last album 'Emails I Can't Send', there were no collabs on the main tracklist and, as it stands, it appears that 'Short n' Sweet' will be a solo Sabrina Carpenter affair. 
That being said, fans have spotted Sabrina and Tyla commenting on each other's posts on Instagram. On June 5, Sabrina wrote: "would love to take you to dinner" on a Tyla post. Tyla then responded: "pick me up at 4:11". A coincidence? I think not!
Based on Sabrina's close friendship with Taylor Swift following The Eras Tour, fans also think the two stars could work together.
Could there be a 'Short n' Sweet' deluxe with collabs? We'll have to wait and see.

As for the vibe of her upcoming music, Sabrina told Interview: ‚ÄúI feel a lot freer and more excited about what I‚Äôm making now because I‚Äôve realised that genre isn‚Äôt necessarily the most important thing. It‚Äôs about honesty and authenticity and whatever you gravitate towards."
She continued: "There were a lot of genres in my last album, and I like to think I‚Äôll continue that throughout writing music."
Bring on SC6!
