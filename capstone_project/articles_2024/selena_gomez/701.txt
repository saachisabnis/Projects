Only Murders in the Building is returning to Hulu this summer, and three new faces will join the mystery-comedy series’ cast.
Deadline reports that Desmin Borges, Siena Werber, and Lilian Rebelo will appear in recurring roles alongside stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez. The Hulu series follows the trio as they investigate murders in the Arconia, their affluent Upper West Side apartment building in New York City.
Previously announced cast additions include Zach Galifianakis, Kumail Nanjiani, Eva Longoria, Eugene Levy, and Molly Shannon. Meryl Streep, who played Short’s love interest in the third season, will return for season four.
Season four will start in Los Angeles and then return to New York to follow the investigation of the murder of Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch), Charles-Haden Savage’s (Martin) stunt double from his years starring in the Brazzos series and its 2020 revival.
No details about the new roles were revealed, but they will be integral to the investigation. The premiere date for season four of Only Murders in the Building will be announced later.
