Tatcha has a special place in my heart because it was one of the first brands I tested for our Best of Beauty Awards when I first started at Allure over three years ago. I feel head over heels in love with The Texture Tonic, an AHA-packed toner that made my pesky nose pores seemingly vanish overnight, and watching it win an award a few months later was a surreal, deeply cool moment I'll remember for the rest of my career. Ever since that serendipitous introduction to Tatcha's Japanese botanical-boosted product line, I've been a staunch supporter of the brand, so when I tell you you don't want to miss these deals, know that I really mean it. Anyway, sentimental moment done! Let's talk details.

As professional shoppers, we like to think we know a thing or two about gifting, and so believe us when we say that Tatcha's gift sets make top-tier presents. The Merry Minis Stocking and Serum Discovery Trio are great intros to the brand and come with a variety of products for your giftee to sample and ultimately fall in love with. The real crème de la creams of Tatcha gifting are the Ritual Sets, which come with a full routine of botanical boosted products catered towards specific skin types like oily or dry.

Oily skin, meet your match. Tatcha's Pure Pores Silky Suncare set comes with the clarifying Matcha Cleanse, Allure Readers' Choice Award-winning Water Cream, and the Silk Sunscreen, a daily SPF that sits beautifully on the skin and won't clog pores. And for $80 off its value? Deal of the century.

Gift-shopping for a beauty fiend this year? It can be hard to impress someone who has a mountain of lippies at the bottom of their bag, but we have a feeling this Tatcha set might do the trick. The Camellia balm is equal parts moisturizing and stunning, and the Plum Blossom shade of the Kissu Lip Tint is the platonic ideal of a kissable, every day lip shade.

We couldn't believe our eyes when we saw how cute this holiday-themed Tatcha set was. It comes with four mini jars of beloved Tatcha moisturizer formulas, including the Dewy Cream and the Water Cream. The cherry on top is the Camellia Gold Spun Lip Balm, which will make your lips soft and ready to give a big kiss to whoever gifted this to you this holiday season.

Tatcha's plumping Dewy Skin Trio includes three of the brand's most beloved products: The Rice Wash, The Dewy Serum, and The Dewy Skin Cream. Each formula puts their Hadasei-3 blend to work, as well as hyaluronic acid, squalane, and the like. If you're gifting the set, rather than keeping it for yourself (we support either), it comes with a custom furoshiki cloth gift wrap. On the Tatcha site, you'll find a handy a on how to wrap the cloth like a pro.

Part of why we love Tatcha so much is the brand's careful curation of routines for different skin types and concerns, and Cyber Monday is the perfect opportunity to pick up a ritual that'll do the trick for you or a loved one. The Serum Discovery Trio is among them, featuring three best-selling serums.

The Starter Ritual is a whole skin-clarifying, pore-refining routine in one box. With five moisturizing, cleansing, and nourishing steps, you'll become a Tatcha loyalist in no time. The set includes The Camellia Cleansing Oil, The Essence, The Dewy Skin Cream, The Silk Peony, and The Rice Polish.

Show your lips some major love this holiday season with Tatcha's Kissu Lip Ritual set. Start by exfoliating your lips with the Kissu Lip Scrub, treat them to some moisture with the Kissu Lip Treatment, then top it all off with a Kissu Lip Tint in Plum Blossom, a cool mauve pink, and you're ready to stand under the misteltoe.
There is truly no joy like starting and finishing your day with a luscious Tatcha cleanser, and luckily the brand has a product fit for all skin types, preferences, and concerns. Dry skin types, look no further than The Rice Wash. It's delectably creamy and plumping, and makes washing your face—even when you're tired! Just do it!—a delight. Double cleansers of the Internet, give the Camellia Cleansing Oil a go. Watching makeup seamlessly melt off is deeply satisfying, both for you and your skin.

If you ask us, all Tatcha products deserve the royal treatment—but only this one is literally sitting inside of Meghan Markle's bathroom right now (that we know of!). The Rice Polish: Classic is your one way ticket to soft, silky skin. When you add water, it transforms from a powder to a foam cleanser that conditions and gently exfoliates.

Dry winter skin, meet your creamy cleanser match. Hyaluronic acid and red algae boost hydration and plump the skin, but the real not-so-secret ingredient here is rice powder. It deep cleanses and softens the skin for a supple feel.

A solid skin-care routine starts with a good cleanse, and Tatcha understands that better than most. The brand offers a variety of cleanser options, so no matter what type of face wash you prefer, you'll be able to find something you love. Looking to start a double-cleansing routine? Try The Indigo Cleansing Balm—this makeup buster makes an excellent first step.

Then, there's Tatcha's The Deep Cleanse, which has picked up two Allure Best of Beauty Awards. This gel-based formula is made with the deep-cleaning fibrous luffa fruit, while its wild rose smoothes skin, and, finally, its leopard lily sops up excess sebum for a clean, satiny finish. This might be your new favorite cleanser if you have combination or oily skin.

Channel your inner Elphaba with this luxurious melting cleanser formula. Tatcha's The Camellia Cleansing Oil dissolves makeup, sunscreen, and excess oil for a deep clean that leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.

For serious pore excavation business, look no further than the Rice Polish: Deep. Stronger than the Rice Polish: Classic, this formula is ideal for oily skin and acne-prone types who need a bit more thorough exfoliation in their routine.
Need a place to start with Tatcha? Try incorporating one of brand's the widely-loved serum formulas into your routine, although we must warn you—you might fall in love and have the urge to replace everything you currently use with a pretty pastel bottle. The Silk Serum won a Best of Beauty Award in 2023 because its retinol alternative worked wonders on skin texture, fine lines, and wrinkles sans irritation—it's a dream for sensitive skin. Another Best of Beauty winner, The Essence, is a creamy toner that delivers baby-soft skin thanks to an unexpected secret ingredient: yeast.

The fragrance-free Violet-C Brightening Serum is formulated with two types of vitamin C stabilized by antioxidant-rich Japanese beautyberry. It wowed our reviewer, who reported: "After testing it nightly for about four weeks, my acne scars and hyperpigmentation were less noticeable, and my skin—dare I say it?—looked brighter and more even than it had in a long time."

Attention sensitive-skin folks: The Silk Serum is made for you. This 2023 Best of Beauty winner contains a retinol alternative duo that firms and smoothes the look of fine lines and wrinkles without irritating the skin or being to harsh.

The Serum Stick is a convenient, compact, and concentrated solid serum that softens fine lines and keeps makeup looking freshly applied all day. Just glide the stick wherever your skin needs some extra sheen.

The Essence won a 2020 Allure Best of Beauty Award, and we're still using it four years later. Allure commerce editor Sarah Han vouched for its effectiveness in her rave review, saying The Essence plumped up her tired, stressed skin. Apart from the usual suspects of moisture-boosting green tea, rice, algae, and glycerin, this product contains a secret weapon: yeast. Yeast? Yeast. Its fermentation process naturally produces lactic acid which speeds up skin cell turnover for baby-soft skin.

When the winter dryness starts bringing you down, reach for The Dewy Serum. This plumping formula instantly hydrates with hyaluronic acid and squalane and brings back the bouncy boost your skin has been missing since summer went away.

Allure editors didn't invent unwinding at the end of the day with a cozy blanket and a face mask, but we do like to think we've perfected it by incorporating Tatcha masks into our routines. Whether we need a boost of brightness or a good gunk-removal sesh, Tatcha masks always get our skin back to its happiest, glowiest state.

You'll come for the creamy lavender formula and stay for the major brightening benefits. Similar to the Violet-C Serum, the Violet-C Radiance Mask also contains Japanese beautyberry, two types of vitamin C, and 10 percent AHAs to gently and effectively resurface the skin. Apply a generous layer, take a 15-20 minute TikTok break, and rinse.

This little green jar may look cute but it means serious business when it comes to pore purification. Okinawa kucha clay absorbs excess oil while Japanese volcanic ash summons and sweeps all that pesky dirt and gunk away. It's the kind of mask they'd apply at a tropical beachfront spa, but it's (nearly) right at your fingertips.

Treat your cracked lips to Tatcha's Kissu Lip Mask, a moisture-boosting and line-smoothing treatment spiked with squalane and Japanese peach extract. Also, that little gold applicator spoon is so fun (and it has a designated spot, too).
We don't pick favorites here at Allure, but it's undeniable that Tatcha moisturizers are some of the shining stars of the brand's collection. There are few cases of dull, tired skin that The Dewy Cream can't plump back to glowy life. And we'd be remiss not to mention The Water Cream, a repeat Readers' Choice Award winner that is eau-so-hydrating and refreshing.

Want to cocoon your skin in one of the yummiest, plumping creams we've slathered on? Click add to cart on The Dewy Skin Cream. This best seller is bursting with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-sealing biomimetic squalane, and free radical-fighting Japanese purple rice for an ultra-strong barrier and serious glow.

As the name implies, this moisturizer is like a rejuvenating drink of water for the skin. We particularly love this oil-free, water-based formula for acne-prone skin, but its hydrating, skin-smoothing finish looks (and feels) amazing on all skin types.

Tatcha's Indigo Overnight Repair gives a whole new meaning to the term “beauty sleep.” Slather on a layer before bed, catch some Zs, then wake up to reduced redness, a stronger barrier, and (after continued use) less prominent fine lines and wrinkles.

Looking to incorporate the benefits of retinol into your routine? The Silk Cream might be your match, even though it doesn't technically contain retinol. Instead, it's formulated with Bulgarian rose, a retinol alternative that lessens the look of fine lines and increases firmness. On top of its skin smoothing benefits, the hydration and softness it imparts are top notch.

If you're looking to address loss of elasticity and fine lines, run, don't walk to add the Ageless Enriching Renewal Cream to your cart while its nearly $50 off. It contains a veritable bouquet of ingredients that show mature skin some love—peony addresses fine lines and wrinkles and gardenia fruit extract works to retain and regain the skin's firmness—see what we did there?
Tatcha's eye-cream selection may be highly edited, but inside the small packages are mighty formulas that pamper your eyes with luxurious moisture and bring about abundant smoothing and brightening benefits.

Treat the thin, delicate skin around your eyes with the utmost respect via The Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream. The cream forms a moisture seal using white peony extract, while silk proteins impart dewiness and blur fine lines.

Applying a dab of Tatcha's Luminous Deep Hydration Firming Eye Serum is a simple but genuine pleasure we think you deserve to experience, especially when you can save $22 on it this Cyber Monday. Caffeine and honeysuckle extract reduce puffiness but the kicker is the 23K gold, which makes you look wide awake, not glittery.
Wearing sunscreen every day is necessary—yes, even in winter!—so why not love the process by reaching for a fabulous Tatcha sunscreen every morning. A moment for Tatcha's recently repackaged Silk Sunscreen—who doesn't love a good makeover?

Thankfully, the days of gloopy, chalky, makeup-stifling sunscreen are behind us. Instead, we're lucky to be alive at the same time as Tatcha's The Silk Sunscreen, an Allure editor-approved mineral SPF. The formula is powered by zinc oxide, two silk proteins (sericin and fibroin), niacinamide, squalane, and hyaluronic acid to protect, moisturize, and prep skin for makeup.

If a lightweight sunscreen and a mattifying primer had a baby, it would be this sunscreen. Ideal for oily skin, it minimizes pores, blurs skin, and creates a soft matte finish that looks lovely alone or under makeup.
Makeup from a skin care brand? Groundbreaking, we know. But we can't help but love Tatcha's makeup offerings because although they put skin first, they also don't skimp when it comes performance and color payoff. Tatcha's primers are simply elite and elevate all makeup you apply on top of them. We'd be swiping on Kissu Lip Tint daily even if it didn't protect from UVA/UVB rays, but how lucky are we that it does?
Tatcha

Make no mistake: The Silk Canvas isn't your typical makeup primer. This balm-like multitasker has just as many skin-care benefits as it does aesthetic perks. Silk extract and powder visibly smooth uneven texture and blur the appearance of pores — enhancing the longevity of your foundation or BB cream. Pink and gold pearl add luminosity, while the brand's signature blend of green tea, rice, and algae delivers hydration. In other words, this compact pulls its weight.

We love when skin-care brands do lip balms, because they always get it so right. The Kissu Lip Tint contains SPF 25 to protect the sensitive skin there from harmful UVA and UVB rays, lanolin for moisture retention, and the three sheer shade options are just gorgeous.
Allure editors dropped everything when we found out Tatcha was launching body care two years ago, and we've been sudsing up with these luxurious formulas ever since. On top of smelling divine, the products in the Hinoki line gently exfoliate and nourish the skin with hinoki oil. When the dryness levels hit critical mass, the Indigo line is here to soften and soothe.

Did you know Tatcha made body care? Now you do, and we think you're better off for it. An early Cyber Monday deal is the perfect excuse to give the  Hinoki Body Oil a whirl. "Unlike other body oils on the market, [Hinoki Body Oil] wasn't greasy or slippery," shopping market editor Angela Trakoshis wrote in her review.
Tatcha

Kick off your routine with the Hinoki Body Wash, which brings on the same nourishment as the oil. On top of that, it gently exfoliates using cellulose, and the brand's Forest Awakening Oil Blend fragrance helps ease stress and wake up the senses.

Dry, over-washed hands are no match for the Indigo Soothing Hand Cream. Its gorgeous, sky-blue formula instantly melts into the skin, leaving you with soft, moisturized hands. Silk extracts, squalane, and glycerin maintain moisture for hours, while indigo and oatmeal mitigate redness and irritation.
Tatcha

Among all of the soothing, botanical-boosted products that Tatcha has to offer, the Indigo Body Butter might be the most spa-like. Colloidal oatmeal and glycerin hydrate and soften the skin from head to toe, while Japanese Indigo calms irritation and adds a touch of relaxing, earthy scent. Moisturizing has never been so transportive.
Psst: Did you know that Tatcha is also available on Amazon and you can snag some great Cyber Monday deals over there too? While Amazon may not have the same gifting options available as tatcha.com, you can still grab some of your favorite Tatcha formulas over there too—or better yet, shop our Tatcha Amazon storefront for easy, peasy adding-to-carting.

Category is: silk. Tatcha's Nourishing Care Set comes with three products from its silk line, The Camella Cleansing Oil, The Silk Serum, and the Silk Cream, three products that take extra care to reduce fine lines, boost elasticity, and usher in your softest skin era yet.

My gym doesn't come with sauna and steam room access, but this Hinoki Body Care Trio makes it easy to pretend I shilled out for the luxury membership. The earthy hinoki scent is deeply relaxing and soothing, all three products soften and nourish your body with the care it deserves.

Think of the Indigo Overnight Repair like a fancy band aid from a sci-fi movie. Perhaps not as high tech—yet!—but apply a layer of this nourishing mask before bed and you'll find yourself waking up with soothed skin, a nourished barrier, and that just-slept-eight-full-hours-for-real glow.

We've already waxed poetic about the hydrating squalane and moisture-retaining Japanese Camellia Oil in this adorable little jar, but can we have a moment for the applicator spoon? If loose applicators all around your bathroom is also pet peeve for you, you'll jump for joy when you click the handy gold spoon into its secure spot on top of the jar.

Pretty much every Allure editor loves Tatcha's Silk Sunscreen for its glowy finish, protective properties, and comfy wear—TYSM, silk extract!—but did you know that it's also pregnancy safe? Associate beauty editor Annie Blay officially became a when she made the switch to mineral sunscreen during her first trimester.

There are so many acne spot treatments on the market these days (shout out pimple patches, which you should snag while they're 20% off for Cyber Monday) but why aren't there more dryness spot treatments around? That's why we love The Serum Stick so much. It makes it so easy to hit dry fine lines with a dose of moisturizing squalene and sealing sunflower seed wax for instant blurring and glassy glow.

If you've ever watched a makeup artist work, they'll be the first to tell you about the importance of skin prep, and nobody preps skin better than Tatcha. This trio comes with everything you need to achieve a silky smooth base that compliments and enhances any makeup you apply over it. Start with the Silk Sunscreen (always!), follow up with the Silk Canvas Liquid Primer to tone down texture, then set it all in place with The Silk Powder, a super soft loose powder that absorbs excess oil and adds some filter-y skin blurring.

An underrated item most Allure editors keep on their desks? A hydrating face mist. There's no case of mid-day dryness that The Luminous Dewy Skin Mist can't close. The formula contains a whole host nourishing ingredients—hyaluronic acid and squalane, to name a few—that quickly pep up skin during a dull, dry spell.
Of course, Sephora had to get in on the Tatcha sale action, and who can blame them? While the discounted Tatcha options as Sephora aren't as robust as at tatcha.com or on Amazon, you can still shop some steals while racking up on your VIB points for the next summer sale. We love the radiance boost that the Violet-C Brightening Serum consistently delivers, and it's $22 off right now.
