When not playing NYPD Captain Olivia Benson on television, Hargitay — the daughter of the impossibly gorgeous late actress Jayne Mansfield — is often striking a pose.

As seen above and below for a photo shoot with Interview magazine, Hargitay got on her knees (in nothing but black hosiery) and played with her cat Karma on the bed.

The fashion-forward photos of Hargitay run side-by-side with an interview conducted by mega pop star/actress Selena Gomez (Only Murders in the Building). Swipe the oversized leopard-print coat photo below to see Hargitay and Gomez cheek to cheek.

Hargitay’s fans are going wild over the collaboration with Gomez. As one fan replied: “I would love to see Selena Gomez do an SVU episode that would be so epic 😱”

Another fan pointed out the resemblance between Hargitay and her mother Mansfield, who was often photographed in a leopard-print: “It’s giving 60s Jayne Mansfield vibes! You are your Mama’s twin!” 
That’s Mansfield in the leopard-print coat above and soaking her feet on the left, below.
