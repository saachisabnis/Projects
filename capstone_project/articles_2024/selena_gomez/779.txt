Pachinko could win, but I think it will probably be released too late, maybe in May.
Lowkey was more deserving than all of the drama series nominees two years ago.
TV FYC: Kevin Kline ("Disclaimer), Bridget Everett ("Somebody Somewhere"), Severance in all categories
Give Meg Ryan the Oscar vehicle she deserves!
Pachinko will probably be the best contender but I doubt it’ll even be nominated sadly.
Stream MAYHEM, give Sarah Snook her Tony, Colin Farrell his Emmy and make Severance, The Studio + The Pitt sweep all awards!
The 3x Emmy Winner for Best Drama Series, Succession!
Before the comedy field started filling up and Hacks and Abbott Elementary were announced to be returning I actually did consider the possibility of Good Omens sneaking into series because of visibility and how much tech support it had last time round when the craft categories were combined.
They technically good move Good Omens to drama at a stretch. It’s not, tonally, but it’s an hour long this year, and they ran in limited last time I believe.
I for sure hope Elsbeth gets at least a single ATL nomination, CBS you better market it goddamnit

I think it can sneak in if critics and writers continue to support it. It sounds pretty likely as a tca nominee already so that’s something.
I read a rumor that it’s coming out April 26, don’t know if it that’s true so we will see.

Does anyone remember when Apple’s TCA panel is?

February 5th. They’re first out of all the networks I believe.

Also, is anything going to warrant a Superbowl trailer or commercial push?

That would leave hanging episodes right?

If they premiere with 2 ep then it would air 7 episodes before the deadline with only the finale being an hanging episode
I suspect competitive shows that have enough eps to air to be eligible and are on a two year schedule anyway are probably just going to get the eligible eps out. Especially something like Pachinko which probably won’t hold buzz a whole cycle ala The Bear.

It would be ironic if because of the dramas frauding themselves in the comedy categories the actual comedies end up frauding themselves in drama lol.

idk, it feels like something would have to be a this is us sized buzzy smash to break through as a network drama these days.
a cbs cop procedural doesn’t seem likely.
Are any of these feasible outside of Ahsoka and Loki?
Thought last year that maybe The Night Agent could be just based on sheer numbers. eg if 17% of academy members had watched and had it lower down on their ballots, it would place higher than something minimally seen but with a higher  #1 placements (eg Bad Sisters). If something new from Netflix breaks in the spring on a similar than possibly that since I do think Night Agent would be a solid 7th-8th place contender in this current cycle. 
As far as I know, Reacher premiered to far bigger numbers for S2 over the holiday period than all of S1 did, could possibly be more enjoyed over that period than we know since we haven’t had any evidence that is isn’t (similar to the late release of Chippendales last year).
Also thought One Piece could but given it nomination at MUAHS as Children or Teen Series, I assume that will submitted to Children and Family Emmys instead of Primetime
It was discussed in the ceremony reaction about maybe the possibility of Grey’s Anatomy breaking back in or Always Sunny coming in for the first because of nostalgia for long running shows (which I think will only be heightened in the wake of so many recent cancellations after 2 seasons max). Variety jokingly brought up Law & Order returning to series on their post-Emmy podcast when discussing next year’s drama contenders but I kinda think it’s possible for SVU and specifically for Hargitay too. She stuck around far longer at the Emmys and SAG than most if not all network procedurals did (her last nomination was in 2011, for context, the first year of American Horror Story and Game of Thrones). The show still has a prominent fan base of active and passive viewers of all ages, and herself and Ice-T being consistent presence it doesn’t really feel as much of a relic as Grey’s did with an almost entirely new main cast including the lose of its lead, also helps that the two of them have been on a press cycle highlighting it’s 25th season. For all we know she and/or the show could’ve been in the 12-15 range for total votes all these years.
obviously not a good gauge, but mariska remains a perennial people’s choice award nominee.
