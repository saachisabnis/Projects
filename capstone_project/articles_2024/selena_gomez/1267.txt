“It’s not just about the ring.”
Selena Gomez just got an early holiday present. The singer-actress just announced that she's engaged to Benny Blanco. 
Selena shared the happy news with fans in an Instagram post with a sweet caption that said, “Forever begins now..”
Naturally, people completely freaked, including several of Selena’s famous friends. 
“Yes I will be the flower girl,” wrote Taylor Swift. 
“HONEY!! Congratulations sweet mama! ❤️” said Jennifer Aniston.
Cardi B chimed in with “Waiiiitttt hold on 😱😱😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️.”
The Only Murders in the Building star and Benny went public with their relationship last December, although he produced a few songs for her years before that. Selena later confirmed in an Instagram comment that’s since been deleted that she and Benny had been secretly dating for six months at that point. 
Selena even sweetly wrote “My bes fwend,” in a series of photos dedicated to Benny in February.
She later shared a sweet tribute to Benny on his birthday, writing in the caption, "Your emotional endurance, positive disposition, unbelievable talent (that blows me away), undeniable humor and loving, kind heart absolutely kill me. I love you."
While Selena has shared photos and some snippets of her life with Benny, she’s kept details of their romance pretty private. 
But the photos Selena just dropped suggest that she’s in a loving, supportive union, according to body language expert Patti Wood. Here’s what she thinks the latest photos suggest about their relationship.
Meet the expert: Patti Wood is the author of Snap: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language, and Charisma.
The first photo is a classic engagement ring shot, but Wood says there are some clues in it. “I love that the hand is lifted up—that’s a small indicator,” she says. This suggests that, not only does Selena want to show off her ring, but her energy is also lifted by her fiance, Wood says. 
There’s a lot going on in this photo. (I see you, Taco Bell boxes.) Wood notes that Selena’s fingers are once again lifted. “That’s an indication, not only of joy, but that she wants to be even closer to the symbolism of it,” Wood says. 
Selena is also supporting her left hand with her other hand. “That suggests that she wants to support the marriage,” Wood says. “It’s not just about the ring.” 
The 32-year-old’s smile is also telling. “Her cheeks are fully lifted, and her front teeth are showing,” Wood says. “If you look at the muscles in her face, they’re very smooth, peaceful, and relaxed.” That suggests that she feels confident and comfortable in her relationship. 
This photo shows Selena’s joy. 
“It’s like a little kid on Christmas morning, like she woke up and saw the tree,” Wood says. “It ‘s like an ‘oh my God’ kind of a surprise.” Her smile is also innocent and suggests Selena is feeling the “magic” of getting engaged, Wood says. 
Wood points out that Benny is “cradling” Selena in the last picture. But despite wrapping his arms around her, his hands aren’t holding her tight. 
“He’s not pulling her inward in a way of saying ‘mine, mine, mine’ ownership,” Wood says. “It’s more like, ‘I’m going to take care of you, babe.’”
Wood also flags Benny’s “very tender, gentle kiss.” She adds, “He’s not pressing own or going over the top—it’s very nurturing.” 
Big congrats, Selena and Benny!
