Brooke Shields attended the Los Angeles Special Screening Of Netflix’s “Mother Of The Bride” at the Bay Theater in a red pair of pointed pumps on Wednesday evening.
Also an executive producer of the film, “Mother Of The Bride” sees Shields starring alongside Miranda Cosgrove as a woman who’s stunned by her daughter’s bombshell wedding announcement, while simultaneously being blindsided by another shock: the groom’s father is the man who broke her heart years ago. Directed by Mark Water, the film releases on Netflix today.

 









Shields is typically known to go for elegant shoes that are also comfortable when it comes to high-profile events. In April, the actress donned a pair of sparkly silver metallic wedge sandals to the Kit Kat Club at the August Wilson Theatre in New York City. The shoes featured an open-toe design and a chunky toe strap adorned with silver crystals and metallic wedge heels as the finisher. Also in April, the former model participated in the Balletcore trend by showcasing bright pink ballet flats during an appearance of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.”
