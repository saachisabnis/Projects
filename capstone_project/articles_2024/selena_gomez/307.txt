Selena Gomez was a sight to behold at the 2nd Annual Rare Impact Fund Benefit, held in Los Angeles on Oct. 25. For the mental health-focused event, the Rare Beauty founder slid into a pair of glossy Christian Louboutin pumps to match a sophisticated black gown.
Gomez brought elegance to the event in a black one-shoulder dress with a fitted bodice and asymmetrical skirt. The skirt featured layers of structured folds, with a flowing piece of fabric on the right side falling gracefully to the ground. Her shoulder-length brunette hair was styled in gentle waves while a few sparkling rings adorned her hands.

Gomez selected a pair of black patent leather pumps from Christian Louboutin to match her gown. She appeared to be wearing the brand’s Jumping style, which featured a single thin strap stretching diagonally across the top of the foot. The shoe was a D’Orsay style, with the upper cut down along the side, revealing more of the foot.

The pumps were designed with an enclosure in back covering the heel while the upper had a V-shaped outline in front, which was just slightly misaligned with the sharply pointed toe. The brand’s signature red hue can be seen on the shoe’s sole and the inside of its narrow stiletto heel. The style can be purchased secondhand from Poshmark. She wore the shoes recently during the SAG-AFTRA Foundation Conversations for “Emilia Pérez” at SAG-AFTRA Foundation Robin Williams Center on Oct. 15 in New York City.
Gomez has been showing off a slew of chic red carpet looks in recent times. She’s been booked and busy promoting the film “Emilia Pérez“; among several ensembles, she wore red Louboutin So Kate pumps and black platform Giuseppe Zanotti sandals for appearances related to the upcoming movie. She also slipped on a go-to pair of glossy black Jimmy Choo pumps when she attended a Rare Beauty and Sephora event earlier in October celebrating World Mental Health Day.
