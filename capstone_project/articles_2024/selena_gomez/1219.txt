Keep this list handy to catch the stars who are making history and those who might break records at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards, airing next Sunday, September 15 at 8:00 p.m. The night promises to be unforgettable, full of surprises and milestones.
Thanks to VegasInsider's thorough data compilation, we know that this year could see Latina, African-American, Asian, and Native American actresses making significant strides. Here's who might set new records:
First up is Sofia Vergara, who could become the first Latina actress to win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Limited Series for her role in Griselda. Achieving this would not only make her the first Latina to win in this category but also the first Colombian actress to take home an Emmy. Known for her beloved role in Modern Family, Sofia has a chance to further solidify her TV legacy.
Selena Gomez is also in the spotlight, nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Only Murders in the Building. If she wins, she will become the second Latina actress to secure this award, following America Ferrera. With her dual career in music and acting, Selena is poised to make a significant impact in this competitive category.
Another Latina making waves is Liza Colón-Zayas, nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for The Bear. A win would make her the first Latina to win in this category, showcasing the growing influence of Hispanic talent in American television.
In another notable category, Quinta Brunson could become the first African-American actress to win two consecutive Emmys for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Abbott Elementary. Additionally, if actresses like Ayo Edebiri (The Bear) or Maya Rudolph (Loot) win, it would mark the first time two African-American actresses have won this category in back-to-back years, setting a significant record.
Asian actresses could also make history this year. Both Anna Sawai (Shōgun) and Maya Erskine (Mr. & Mrs. Smith) have a shot at becoming the first Asian actresses to win Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a category traditionally dominated by Caucasian actresses.
Regarding series, Shōgun has already set a record for the most Emmys won in a single year, surpassing Game of Thrones with 14 awards so far. With additional nominations, this number might increase. The Bear also has a chance to break its own record as the comedy with the most Emmys in a single year, having already won seven at the Creative Arts Emmys and being nominated for nine more at the main ceremony.
RuPaul's Drag Race might extend its record as the most awarded reality show in Emmy history, with 24 cumulative wins. A win in the Best Reality Competition Program category would bring its total to 25, solidifying its legendary status.
Additionally, 91-year-old Carol Burnett could become the oldest actress to win an Emmy in any acting category if she triumphs in Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Palm Royale. The current record is held by John Gielgud, who won at age 87 for Summer's Lease.
Other nominations to watch include Robert Downey Jr., who could make history by becoming the first actor to win an Oscar, Daytime Emmy, and Primetime Emmy in the same year, having already won an Oscar for Oppenheimer and a Daytime Emmy for Downey's Dream Cars.
Finally, Saturday Night Live has already extended its record as the most awarded TV show in Emmy history, with 101 wins, and still has a chance to add more.
The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards not only celebrate television excellence but also mark a new era in entertainment.
