Fresh news from the Arconia – there’s another famous face heading for the next season of Only Murders In the Building. The hit comedy-drama – which presents a different mystery to be solved every season by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez’s podcast trio – has had a parade of stars over the years, whether it was Sting in Season 1, Amy Schumer in Season 2, and Matthew Broderick, Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd in Season 3. And among the new faces for the forthcoming fourth season, there’s a firm favourite from another cosy-favourite comedy: Schitt’s Creek’s Eugene Levy.
The most magnificently-browed man in the business is, according to Variety, set to have a recurring role in Season 4 – joining fellow newcomers to the show, Eva Longoria and Molly Shannon. Plus, Streep is returning as rising stage star Loretta Durkin, after her sizeable role last time around. It’s unknown exactly who Levy will be playing – if he’ll be an Arconia resident, an outsider, a suspect, or something else. But the end of Season 3 – SPOILER WARNING – gave a tantalising set-up for the next story: someone has shot Charles-Haden Savage’s (Martin) stunt double Sazz (Jane Lynch), after mistaking her for the former TV actor. So, whodunnit? And what’s their beef with the star of Brazzos?
With casting well underway, expect the new season to start shooting before long – and fingers crossed, as with the previous three runs, it’ll be a quick turnaround and end up on our screens later this year too.
