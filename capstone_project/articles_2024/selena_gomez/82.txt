		After one sleep, don’t be surprised when you consider this PJ set a travel necessity. The pants and long sleeve were designed with a soft Tencel material that has reviewers obsessed with how “buttery soft” it is. The top comes with a button-up design that you can customize to your liking as well as a front pocket for added style.	

		Just like the women’s style, the William Modal Long PJ Set comes in the popular Tencel material that’s both stretchy and soft for ultimate comfort. Both the top and bottoms were created to be breathable that’ll help regulate your temperature — plus, it’s machine washable for easier cleaning.
