If you think of any Hollywood heartthrob, they‚Äôll no doubt have appeared in People‚Äôs Sexiest Man of the Year issue. From Patrick Dempsey to Idris Elba and (of course) George Clooney, it‚Äôs pretty much the male equivalent of making Victoria‚Äôs Secret catwalk.
But while there have been plenty of uncontentious choices since the awards kicked off in 1985 (Mel Gibson was the first recipient, FYI), some of People‚Äôs picks have raised a few eyebrows. A sixty-year-old Sean Connery (1989) wasn‚Äôt the most crowd-pleasing selection; nor was country music star Blake Shelton in 2017 (one X user wrote: ‚ÄòBlake Shelton is People‚Äôs Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night‚Äô).
But few inclusions have caused as much furore as last night‚Äôs reveal, when People announced Selena Gomez‚Äôs boyfriend, Benny Blanco, would feature in the 2024 list. While it‚Äôs not yet been confirmed whether the record producer has secured the esteemed number one slot, the magazine feature about him is pretty gushing.
In his People interview, Blanco ‚Äì who‚Äôs been dating Selena since 2023 ‚Äì is described as ‚Äòredefining masculinity while embracing chivalry‚Äô. Under the headline ‚ÄòHe cooks. He hosts. He woos,‚Äô Blanco is photographed lying on a table in a three-piece suit with a plate of pizza, preparing a margarita by the pool, and, most randomly, sitting on a plush bed in patterned pyjama bottoms cuddling a teddy. Hot!
Safe to say, the internet had thoughts...¬†

Was literally every other man unavailable?
Have we not suffered enough???? https://t.co/V0wsdnw4lj
Others suggested his girlfriend, Selena, might be more deserving of People's sexiest accolade...¬†
the only sexy thing about him is his girlfriend
Sexiest thing about him is Selena But she seems so happy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And others gave shout outs to their favourite male heartthrobs, suggesting they'd been 'snubbed' for the shock pick...¬†
Oh Jonathan Bailey how they‚Äôve snubbed you pic.twitter.com/lyMWXc5mtY
I‚Äôm not hating but my personal pick would have been Theo James, Jonathon Bailey, Glen Powell, etc.

Ultimately, we're not sure who'll bag People's top spot for 2024 (we'll update this page when the news comes in). One thing that is certain, however, is that pretty much any other male celeb would be less controversial than Blanco. In the meantime, we're channelling confused Adele and keeping Paul Mescal in our thoughts.¬†
