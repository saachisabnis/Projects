Katie Holmes has worn some stunning looks during the fall season, proving that her casual yet sophisticated wardrobe is perfect all year round. The filmmaker and actress is ready for winter, transitioning into colder temperatures with another stylish outfit.
Katie was spotted in New York City walking in a monochromatic look, which consisted of a voluminous leather skirt, a white shirt, and a knitted vest. The actress looked cozy and paired the look with gray pumps. 
She wore minimal gold jewelry and styled her hair in loose waves. Katie rocked a glamorous makeup look and smiled for the cameras during her latest outing in NYC. 
"I enjoy [fashion]. I mean, I enjoy the craftsmanship. I enjoy putting things together. And I work with [stylist] Brie Welch, and she's very detail-oriented, which inspires me. I think it is very creative. I love vintage shopping. I love the art of design," she told Glamour about her love for fashion.
Katie was photographed on her way to her Broadway show, wearing a casual look this fall. She was all smiles wearing light-wash jeans, a white button-down and an oversized gray cardigan paired with black ballet flats and a large Dune London bag in brown. 
Katie wore the perfect quilted jacket during her recent NYC outing, paired with wide-leg jeans, white sneakers, and a tote bag.
The actress also showed her preference for a classic denim trend, also worn by Selena Gomez recently. Katie wore high-rise wide-leg blue jeans, paired with blue loafers. She wore a yellow top featuring a turtle neck and a light yellow coat.
