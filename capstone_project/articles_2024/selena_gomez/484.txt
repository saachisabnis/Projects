On Monday, Selena Gomez offered her fans a Rare Beauty tutorial on her Instagram timeline. In the video, she applied bronzer, blush, and some mascara—all while flashing her gorgeous marquise diamond engagement ring.
Gomez wore a black tank top for her montage of makeup application and sat on a red and white bedspread. Behind her, a room decorated in cream shades can be seen with open curtains revealing the city skyline. She captioned the post, “@rarebeauty to go.”
Gomez announced she and Benny Blanco had gotten engaged on December 11, sharing photos of the ring and their romantic Taco Bell picnic on a film set with fake grass and trees. The pair had been dating since June of 2023 at the time of the engagement.
A source speaking with Entertainment Tonight about the engagement said that Gomez “finally felt comfortable enough” in a romantic relationship to be public about it.
“She feels so safe and secure with him, so she felt like it was a good time to share how happy she is with her fans,” the source explained. “Benny is a great communicator, is honest and open with Selena, and listens to her. He’s respectful, isn’t a player, and not in it for the attention or fame. He doesn’t care about any of that and Selena sees that and really trusts him.”
The pair were familiar with each other for a long time before getting together and Gomez can be “her most authentic self with Benny without doubting his potential motives.”
The source went on, “It’s taken a lot for her to let someone in, but Benny has proven himself to her and she appreciates his ideals and morals. She feels like she can give him a part of her heart that she hasn’t been able to, or willing to, offer in a relationship in a very long time. Selena feels like she has finally found one of the good guys and it’s been very refreshing for her. Their feelings for each other are very mutual and they are looking forward to growing their relationship and special bond.”
