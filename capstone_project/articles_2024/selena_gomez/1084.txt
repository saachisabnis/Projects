The music producer took to his Instagram Stories on Wednesday (Jun 12) to share a sweet photo of make-up free Gomez cozied up, resting on a pillow with her hair in a bun and her eyes closed, and captioning the snap, "she's back." The pair had spent some time apart as the "Love On" singer attended the Cannes Film Festival in May to promote her new movie Emilia Perez, per People. She was also away in New York City where was filming for her hit Hulu show Only Murders in the Building. 
Gomez recently opened up about her previous plans to adopt children as a single mom when she hit a certain age after not dating anyone for several years prior to her romance with her now-boyfriend. Blanco has also spoken about his "next goal" with Gomez, calling her his "best friend" as he shared insight into what he hopes their future looks like. 
The Wizards of Waverly Place star confirmed her relationship with Blanco in December 2023, telling her followers that he is "my absolute everything in my heart." The pair are about to celebrate their first anniversary in July.
