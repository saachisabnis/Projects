The 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards are just around the corner, with a whole host of TV shows and stars set to compete for trophies on television’s biggest night of the year.
The forthcoming ceremony will arrive just months after the delayed 2023 Emmy Awards were broadcast in early January this year, due to actors’ and writers’ strikes.
On 17 July, Veep star Tony Hale and Abbott Elementary’s Sheryl Lee Ralph revealed the TV shows and stars in contention for this year’s gongs.
As expected, FX’s historical drama Shogun and dark comedy The Bear received several nods as did Richard Gadd’s controversial Netflix hit, Baby Reindeer.
Shows eligible for the Primetime Emmys must have been broadcast in the US between June 1, 2023 and May 31, 2024, with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences choosing the nominees.
Winners will be revealed at the live ceremony on Sunday, September 15.
