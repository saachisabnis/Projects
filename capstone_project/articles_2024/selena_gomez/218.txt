I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this is the most miraculous makeup product I have ever tried. It's incredibly easy to use and as the name suggests, it really looks like I am walking around with a filter on in real life.
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I wear this in so many ways: on bare skin, underneath makeup, mixed in with foundation, and over foundation to illuminate the high points of the face. I will never run out of this. Ever. 
Shade Options: 12
This foundation just looks like my skin, at its very best. If I only had to use one makeup product for the rest of my life, this is it. It's worth every penny.
More E! Shopping Editor Insights: I am not even kidding when I say that I have eight bottles of this foundation in my bathroom. You know when you're 'done' using a product, but you can still get one pump of product out? I keep these near-empty bottles just to get that one pump of product on my makeup sponge. Plus, I always make sure I have a full bottle on hand for when I am in a rush getting ready or if I just don't have enough patience to get one pump of foundation from each bottle.
I always go for the sample when there's a new 'It' foundation around, but I never actually buy a full bottle of any foundation other than this one.
Shade Options: 41
Celebrity Fans: Paige DeSorbo, Kelcey Wetterberg
This super-soft brush is my go-to for applying foundation because it makes the process lightning fast. Honestly, it's so good that I bought a second one just to avoid cleaning it so often. Plus, snagging it at a discounted price? Count me in! 
These contour sticks are amazing to deliver subtle, natural-looking sculpting with ease (no more dragging for color payoff). They're an absolute game-changer.
E! Shopping Editor Tips: The brand advises using these sticks after foundation, but I use it before foundation to get a more natural, chiseled-from-within look. Plus, it's less work with blending when I use this before foundation.
Shade Options: 3
This is a weightless, natural-looking, long-lasting liquid blush that is incredibly easy to blend. Each bottle lasts forever since you only have to use a teeny tiny bit to get that color payoff that you desire.
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I like to blend this in with a brush, but you can use a sponge or your hands. I only use one tiny dot on each side of my face. If I use more, I have to spend more time blending because it's just too much blush otherwise. 
Shade Options: 15
This powder is pure magic! It's like an instant airbrush for my face, blurring out imperfections and minimizing the appearance of pores (which is a major issue for me). 
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I use this after I'm done with makeup. I swirl the powder in the container so all the different colors blend. I put it on with a powder puff and lightly press it into my skin. Then I will wait about five minutes before dusting it off with a brush. Whenever I forget to use this it is so obvious because there is makeup all over my collar. 
Texture-wise, it's smooth as silk, giving my skin that flawless finish I crave. My makeup stays put for hours longer when I use this gem. But the real game-changer? My shade (Color 4) to tones down redness, correct dark spots, and even out my skin tone. 
Shade Options: 6
Get ready for ultra-hydrated lips that shine bright, all while feeling comfortably lightweight.
E! Insider Tip: I use these glosses on their own, over lip liner, and over lipstick.
Celebrity Fans: Kyle Richards
Shade Options: 12
I have very reactive skin, so I've spent a lot of time trying to restore my skin barrier and build up its resilience. I've always loved micellar water, but this is the first micellar cleanser I've used that lathers.
More E! Shopping Editor Insights: It keeps my face clean and hydrated without that overly stripped feeling. This is also a great pairing for products with active ingredients so I am not overloading my skin. 
I do rotate my cleansers, but this is the one I have been using the most because it is so gentle. Thank you, Scarlett Johansson.
Wake up to soft, hydrated lips with this luxurious overnight treatment that feels like a spa session for your pout.
Flavors/Scents: 8
Celebrity Fans: Sydney Sweeney, Porsha Williams, Alix Earle, Justine Skye, Paige DeSorbo, Hannah Brown, Kenzie Ziegler, Dr. Nicole Martin, Alexia Nepola, Drew Sidora, Delilah Belle Hamlin, Serayah, Sydney Warner, and Ashley Haas. 
Sydney Sweeney, told E!, "I have one on me at all times, in my bag, in my bathroom. It has just been my staple product."
I have never been so happy with a skincare product so soon after using it for the first time. This set includes nose strips and face strips (which I love to use on my chin and forehead).
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I put these pore strips on before bed time and let them do their thing.  This set includes nose strips and face strips (which I love to use on my chin and forehead).
The pore strips I previously used had to be applied over wet skin. When they dried, it was a painful process to peel off the strip after 10-15 minutes. In contrast, these hydrocolloid strips stay on for hours and they don't feel like they're tearing my skin when I take them off.
This clay mask clears up my breakouts and brings balance to my oily skin. I could not be more in love.
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I use it twice a week and it has kept my skin consistently clear. 
Wake up to plump, refreshed skin with this dreamy overnight mask that melts into your complexion, delivering hydration and firmness while you catch those Z's.
E! Insider Tip: In my experience, this is also a great mask to put on after retinol and prevent irritation.
Makeup removal becomes eco-friendly and easy with these reusable cloths that require only water for a gentle, effective cleanse, offering a sustainable alternative to disposable wipes.
E! Insider Tip: Wash this before you use it for the first time in hot water. Dry on a hot setting too. When you use this, the more water you put on the cloth, the better it is at removing makeup. Do not use with soap. The cloth is magical on its own.
After watching so many unedited videos of people using this product with unreal results, I had to buy it—and trust me, the mind-blowing volume is real.
I use this on damp hair before I dry and curl it. It give unreal volume and my curls last longer.
Paige DeSorbo says, "Such good volume, I mean insane. This volumizer is my number one product. I use it every single time I blow dry my hair."
This. Hairspray. Is. Everything. I am never without it. I always have a full one deck. It gives my hair a soft, flexible hold and it locks in my style, especially when it's super hot out.
Get ready to experience hair that shines for days, with a luminosity that looks like it's been photoshopped in real life.
E! Shopping Editor Tips:
This spray shields your hair from heat, leaving it silky and light with an incredible scent you'll love.
Restore damaged hair to get that healthy, shiny hair you've always desired with this product, which I think is a truly miraculous hair treatment, in my experience. 
E! Shopping Editor Tips: Just apply the treatment to damp hair (not wet), leave it on for ten minutes (or longer if you want). I usually keep it on for about a half hour. Then, rinse it out, and shampoo and condition as usual. You will see and feel a difference the first time you use it, but if you want major results, work it into your routine by using it 2-3 times per week.
I've been loyal to this one since 2020. It is a complete game changer for my routine. 
You can use the Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 Repairing Treatment on your hair after spraying on some water. Or if you have more money to spend, splurge for the Olaplex No.0 Intensive Bond Builder to prep the hair for even better results. It is so major.
E! Shopping Editor Tips: I brush my clean, dry hair to make sure there are no tangles. I spray No. 0 all over my hair, making sure each section is saturated with product. I set a timer for ten minutes. I keep this on my hair, without rinsing it out.
After leaving No. 0 on my hair for ten minutes, I add No.3 on my hair from roots to ends. If I'm in a rush, I just leave it on for ten minutes and that's enough. However, if I have more time, sometimes I will leave it on for a half hour. Then, I rinse this out, shampoo, and condition. 
If you're looking to add some fullness and shine to your strands, this serum could be the secret to bringing life back to thinning hair.  
E! Shopping Editor Tip: I use this on damp hair and dry hair. I make sure to use it every day.
If you want "you smell amazing" compliments everywhere you go, then this is the scent for you. It's the most refreshing, subtle floral aroma that you will want it with you at all times just so you can freshen up.
