No one pulls off tuxedo-inspired looks like Selena Gomez.
The actress has proven this to be true with back-to-back red carpet outfits this week that feature menswear silhouettes — and lots of sparkle. 
Last night, at Elle’s Women in Hollywood 2024 event, the “Only Murders in the Building” star, 32, put her stamp on classic suiting, donning a bead-heavy black Ralph Lauren jumpsuit with silky lapels. 
With the help of stylist Erin Walsh, Gomez continued the sparkly theme through her accessories, wearing diamond-encrusted hoops and two diamond rings from Chopard. 
In a similar sartorial vein, the Rare Beauty founder wore a custom Ralph Lauren gown on Nov. 17 on the Governors Awards 2024 red carpet.
Styled over a crisp white button-down, the floor-length number was covered in rectangular black beads. 
Gomez upped the ante with a slew of diamond jewelry from Boucheron, including the label’s dangly earrings and three chunky rings. She finished off the look with a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti black platform pumps. 
Much attention has been on Gomez as of late, largely due to the Nov. 1 release of her new musical thriller film “Emilia Pérez.”
Directed by Jacques Audiard, the Netflix movie has already seen success, considering it won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival 2024 — the Jury Prize and the Best Actress Ensemble award (honoring the female cast, including Gomez, Zoe Saldaña, Adriana Paz and Karla Sofía Gascón.). 
The former Disney star has been favoring festive black looks for months, rocking LBDs at the Season 4 premiere of “Only Murders in the Building,” the TIFF premiere of her movie and at the Emmys in September.
She wore a bow-trimmed gown, paired with $70,000 worth of diamonds at the New York Film Festival and even showed off her dance moves in a semi-sheer sparkling mini at a Sabrina Carpenter concert last month.
Looks like she’s staying back to black for now.
