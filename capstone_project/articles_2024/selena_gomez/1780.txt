Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are engaged to be married, but the couple started out as collaborators.
Blanco coproduced two songs on Gomez’s 2015 album, Revival: “Kill Em With Kindness” and “Same Old Love.” The pair quickly became friends, and at one point, Gomez even asked Blanco whether he had anyone he could set her up with. It wasn’t until Blanco brought Gomez to meet one of his friends at a birthday party that she started to see him in a romantic light.
“It just happens when you least expect it,” she said during a May 2024 interview with Time.
The twosome confirmed their relationship in December 2023 and announced their engagement the following December.
“Forever begins now,” Gomez captioned an Instagram post that included a photo of her engagement ring.
Blanco wrote in the comments section, “Hey wait … that’s my wife.”
Years before Gomez and Blanco teamed up for Revival, they crossed paths in a professional capacity at the very beginning of Gomez’s post-Disney Channel music career.
“Neither one of us remembered the meeting,” Blanco said during an April appearance on SiriusXM’s Hits 1. “But [Gomez’s] mom remembered it and was just like, ‘Yeah, you guys were 18.’”
Keep scrolling for a look back at all of Gomez and Blanco’s musical collaborations:
Blanco, who has also worked with artists including Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, Kesha, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Gomez’s ex Justin Bieber, coproduced the 2015 track with production team Rock Mafia.
The Revival single peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blanco coproduced the song with Norwegian production duo Stargate and Charli XCX served as one of the cowriters.
Cashmere Cat’s 2016 electropop song featured vocals by Gomez and Tory Lanez. Blanco coproduced the tune with Cashmere Cat and Frank Dukes.
Gomez and Blanco teamed up with Tainy and J Balvin for the 2019 tune. In the music video, Gomez and Blanco pranced around a comically giant bed dressed in silk pajamas and a white teddy bear suit, respectively.
“Can’t believe we pulled it off in one take — even if I did fall once or twice trying,” Gomez wrote via Instagram at the time.
Just months before Gomez and Blanco hard-launched their relationship, they paired up again for Gomez’s song “Single Soon,” which was released in August 2023. Blanco coproduced the anthem of singledom with Cashmere Cat. At the time, Gomez said she was happy on her own.

“I think everybody goes through the phase of, ‘Oh, it’d be nice to, like, have someone,’ and I get that,” she said while promoting “Single Soon” on Hits 1. “But you know, I’m just enjoying where I’m at, and I just want to be happy with who I am, so that whenever that person comes into my life, I can just have them add on to me instead of being this insecure person that I normally used to be.”
Gomez announced in February 2025 that her new album, I Said I Love You First, with her “best friend” Blanco would be released in March of that year. The couple released their first song off the album ahead of Valentine’s Day called, “Scared of Loving You.”
“I can’t believe I get to spend the rest of my life with you,” Blanco wrote via Instagram at the time, sharing a glimpse of the music video for the first single off the album. “For life 🖤,” Gomez replied in the comments section.
