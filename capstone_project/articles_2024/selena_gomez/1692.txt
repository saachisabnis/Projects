The annual Academy Museum Gala is one of the most star-studded events in Hollywood, and last night’s affair—held at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles—certainly lived up to that reputation. Celebrities including Ariana Grande, Ayo Edebiri, Kim Kardashian, Nicole Kidman, Selena Gomez, Eddie Redmayne, and Greta Lee all walked the step and repeat in their finest evening wear—delivering a seriously impressive red carpet. But the best dressed of the bunch were the A-listers who leaned into a sense of refinement: choosing polished designs with modern flourishes.
Take Wicked co-stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Grande shined in a (Glinda-worthy) pink and white polka-dotted Balmain number with a fitted bodice, based on an archival design. Erivo, meanwhile, did Elphaba green in her fitted Louis Vuitton strapless number. Speaking of duos, sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner also turned heads on the carpet in their slinky black gowns: Kylie opted for a vintage Mugler gown from 1998, while Kendall donned fresh-off-the-runway Schiaparelli. Kaia Gerber also opted for vintage, wearing a black beaded creation from the Givenchy fall 1997 collection.
Some of the best-dressed gents, on the other hand? Eddie Redmayne stood out in his polka-dotted suit, as did Jaden Smith in his studded Louis Vuitton tuxedo and Colman Domingo in his Valentino robe coat with red trousers. Others went more classic, like Paul Mescal in his black Gucci tuxedo.
