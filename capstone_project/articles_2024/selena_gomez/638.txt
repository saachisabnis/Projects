Selena Gomez recently disclosed an unusual yet tragic reason for never sleeping in her bedroom. The 32-year-old actress celebrated World Mental Health Day at last week's fitness summit. During the panel, she talked about her 2022 documentary My Mind &amp; Me and how her room was associated with "a really dark time" due to her bipolar disease. "I spent too much time in my bedroom that I actually don't even sleep in my bedroom anymore," she added. "Because I associate it with such a really dark time." The Only Murders In The Building actress said anxiety can be crippling. “And yeah, I didn't want to leave my bed for years, and part of it was I wasn't doing the work,” she revealed. She added, “I think having a positive conversation with yourself, even if that sounds weird, it's really impactful.” Source: Geo.tv
