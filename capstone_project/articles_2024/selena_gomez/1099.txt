TIME CEO Jessica Sibley sent the following note to staff on Wednesday: 
Team, 
I’d like congratulate the entire TIME team on your achievements so far this year. This month alone has been an incredibly strong one for TIME. During election week, our newsroom worked around the clock, reaching TIME's largest digital audience in 2024 and demonstrating that readers turn to TIME for information they can trust during the world’s biggest moments. TIME is delivering on its vision of covering leaders who shape the world and providing trusted guidance to our audiences.
As you know, our shared priority in TIME101 is to be a cash flow positive company in 2025. Reaching this goal will allow us to create a sustainable way to continue our mission of producing and delivering trusted journalism, which is the foundation of everything we do at TIME. 
Today I am proud to announce that we have reached a significant milestone toward this goal: TIME's Q4 cash flow has had its best performance to date. Building on the current momentum, our objectives are to maintain growth and further expand revenue streams through 2025.
This achievement is a credit to your hard work and dedication. Together, we have recalibrated our business and worked diligently to successfully grow B2B revenue and diversify our revenue streams, while implementing difficult decisions to reduce costs overall. In 2024, we:
Thank you all for your continued dedication to TIME’s future. I’m excited to finish this year strong with each of you. 
Best,Jess
