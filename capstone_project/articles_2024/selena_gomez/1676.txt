Currently on tour to promote her Oscar-contender film, Emilia Perez, Zoe Saldaña’s style has been pure glamour. During yesterday’s appearance on Today, the Avatar actress wore a graceful white dress and high-heel black boots, but there was one sparkly accessory that stole the show. Saldaña was rocking these Kendra Scott Holland Hoop Earrings — and now we need a pair!
The subtle yet glamorous earrings come in gold and silver. They’re adorned with gorgeous white crystals that look like stars in the night sky. Saldaña’s pairing proves just how much a single accessory can elevate an outfit.
The jewelry designer, Kendra Scott, shared with Us, “Our Holland Hoop Earrings have quickly become a holiday favorite this season. With their bright-cut metal detailing, intricate engravings and crystals that catch the light, they add just enough sparkle. What I love most is seeing how everyone — from our amazing customers to celebrities like Zoe Saldaña — styles them in their own unique way. They’re the perfect blend of timelessness and fun, making them a must-have for the season.”
Saldaña isn’t the only celeb who wears the beloved jewelry brand. Her Emilia Perez co-star, Selena Gomez, as well as Taylor Swift, Gwyneth Paltrow and Carrie Underwood are just a few of the jeweler’s fans. Every jewelry-lover can appreciate Kendra Scott’s stunning designs, lasting quality and accessible price point!
