Sabrina Carpenter has announced that her much-anticipated Short n' Sweet Tour will be coming to the UK next year. The tour, which begins this September, has already sold out 33 North American arena dates.
The singer's new album is due to be released on August 23, following the record-breaking success of her hits 'Espresso' and 'Please Please Please'. Earlier this year, she set a new record with the official charts company, becoming the youngest female artist to reach number one and number two in the same week in the UK.
She now beats The Beatles, and matches Justin Bieber, for concurrently having numbers one and two for the most consecutive weeks. Carpenter is also known for her TV roles, including the character Maya Hart in Disney Channel series Girl Meets World.
She has now confirmed UK and Ireland dates for 2025, including performances in Birmingham, London, Glasgow, Manchester and Dublin. The tour will also include European dates in cities such as Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and more.
London-based singer-songwriter Rachel Chinouriri will be the support act on the tour.
