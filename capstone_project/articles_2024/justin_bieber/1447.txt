The singer married the model in 2018
 Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin Bieber are paying no mind to naysayers questioning the status of their relationship.

 The couple, who tied the knot in 2018, are “doing really well,” a source tells PEOPLE.

 “There’s no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever,” the insider says. “They are very, very happy.”

 The update comes amid a flurry of rumors surrounding Justin, 30, and Hailey, 27 — rumors that the Rhode Skin founder squashed in March with a blunt post to her Instagram Story.

 “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong Made out of thin air… Come from the land of delusion…” wrote Hailey. “So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it.”

 While it remains unclear as to which stories Hailey was referring, the rumor mill was sent churning nearly a week earlier when her father Stephen Baldwin publicly shared a post from Victor Marx, the founder of All Things Possible Ministries, that asked for a prayer request for the couple.

 On Wednesday, April 3, Hailey shared a photo to her Instagram Story that featured a sleeping Justin in bed cuddling one of the couple's dog.

 Justin and Hailey have long been bonded by their faith, and on Sunday, March 31, celebrated Easter together with two large chocolate eggs that featured their names written on them in white icing, according to Hailey’s Instagram Stories.

 Hailey also shared a photo of herself posing with a filter that gave her bunny ears with the caption “Happy Easter.”

 The happy holiday came weeks after Justin celebrated turning 30 on March 1.

 To mark the milestone birthday, Hailey shared a sweet tribute to the “Peaches” singer on Instagram via a carousel of photos that feature various photos of the couple together.

 "30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!!🥹😭 that was fast," she wrote in the caption. "words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍."
