Grammy-winning rock duo The Black Keys joined VladTV for an in-depth discussion on their career journey. The duo, consisting of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney, explained how they grew up just a few houses apart from each other and what led them to collaborate on music. They addressed why they remained a duo instead of expanding its members, as well as turning down commercials to remain true to their roots. However, Dan and Patrick revealed their financial struggles despite releasing music to critical acclaim, which influenced them to accept a Nissan ad that increased their exposure and commercial viability. They talked about collaborating with other artists, such as Danger Mouse and Ike Turner, as well as feuding with The White Stripes, Insane Clown Posse, and Justin Bieber. Throughout the rest of the interview, The Black Keys detail their Grammy-winning success, headlining shows, and much more.
