Justin Bieber hasn’t released an album since 2021, but that might be changing very soon!
The “Yummy” singer has dropped several hints about returning to the music scene recently. Keep reading to find out if Justin is releasing new music in 2025.
Rest assured Beliebers, it seems Justin may be planning to drop some music this year.
While Justin hasn’t outright announced his new music, he sure hasn’t been shy about dropping hints. In May 2022, while sitting down with Apple Music, the artist revealed that the album was nearly finished, per Billboard.
He stated, “I don’t think there’s a date yet, but I do know that we’re wrapping it up. It’s almost done. It sounds really good. I’m really excited about it. I got a lot of cool features and yeah, it should be dropping not too long from now.” Well Justin, that was almost two years ago!
Despite no track lists being revealed (yet), the “Stay” singer has talked about the types of songs to expect in the upcoming album.
During that same interview, Justin noted that he’s “always going to have the deep songs that make you feel something, but [he] also thinks there’s something really special about those songs that are just fun, that aren’t too deep, that can just put you in a little zone, put you in a little mood, and you can just ride out and just feel good.”
On January 31, 2024, Justin took to social media to share a series of photos where he’s singing into a microphone, performing alongside other musicians in a studio. The post has generated a lot of buzz and excitement that has fans wondering if this is a confirmation for new music this year …
