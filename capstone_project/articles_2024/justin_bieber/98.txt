	Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber are ready to be parents!

	The singer took to Instagram over the weekend (Aug. 3) to share a series of photos from a date night the couple had recently. In the snaps, in which they’re seen posing outside and in front of a big circular light, Hailey cradles her baby bump while rocking a bright red, draping mini-dress, which she paired with pointed, cream-colored kitten heels.

	The “Love Yourself” singer and Rhode founder announced that they are expecting their first child together back in May, when they took to Instagram to share a series of photos and videos from a film shoot they did among a vast meadow, in which Hailey is seen wearing a skin-tight lace gown, cradling her growing baby bump as Justin snaps photos of her. In one of the clips, the couple also renewed their vows.

	The couple officially wed in September 2018 at a New York City courthouse. A year later, they flew down to the Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel in South Carolina with their friends and family for a more traditional wedding ceremony and star-studded party.

	










	Last month, Hailey opened up about her pregnancy journey for a W Magazine cover story. “I probably could have hid it until the end, but I didn’t enjoy the stress of not being able to enjoy my pregnancy outwardly,” she explained of announcing her pregnancy at the six-month mark. “I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn’t feel good. I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life.”

	She’s also been savoring time with Justin before the baby arrives. “In the beginning [of pregnancy], it was super emotional for me,” she recalled. “Like, ‘I love this human so much. How can I possibly bring someone else into this?’ I’m trying to soak in these days of it being Justin and me, just the two of us.”
