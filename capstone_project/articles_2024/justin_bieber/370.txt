 Hailey Baldwin Bieber was feeling the love on Valentine's Day.

 On Wednesday, the model, 27, posted to Instagram to share several snaps to mark the day, including one of herself wearing an In-N-Out Burger hat and a beautiful bouquet of red roses.

 Hailey wore a red mini skirt and matching cropped cardigan for the occasion, sharing a mirror selfie in her carousel of Instagram photos. She simply captioned the post, "vday 💌🌹🌹."

 The Rhode founder also shared a series of loved-up shots of herself and her husband Justin Bieber on her Instagram Story.

 The "Holy" hitmaker, 29, cuddled his wife as she sat in front of him on some rocks while gazing out to the ocean in one photo, which she captioned "Valentine." In another cute black-and-white shot, the couple shared a smooch.

 Hailey also posted a black-and-white photo from the pair's second wedding ceremony in 2019, while in another image Hailey wore a black T-shirt with Justin's face on it as she sat on the beach at the edge of the ocean. She captioned the picture with a love heart emoji.

 The Biebers first married in September 2018 in a New York City courthouse wedding before tying the knot a year later in front of friends and family in South Carolina.

 The pair regularly pose for romantic social media snaps. Last month, Justin took to Instagram to post three new pictures of himself hanging out with his wife, including a photo of Hailey resting her head on his shoulder.

 “We’re cute ☺️,” Hailey wrote in the comments section.
