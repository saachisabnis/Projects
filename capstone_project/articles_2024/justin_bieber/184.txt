Hailey Bieber recently responded to a series of surprising photos that husband Justin Bieber shared to Instagram last weekend. The "Sorry" standout posted a handful of snaps on social media on Sunday, April 28th, and fans were quick to react. 
Bieber gifted followers several selfies of himself smiling, crying, driving a car, spending time at the beach, and more. Just when fans thought the photo sharing session was over, the beloved artist posted a number of pictures minutes later, with the next round showcasing stage time, more selfies, and views of the ocean. The unexpected, yet much-welcomed posting marathon continued with snaps of the artist trying on shoes, sitting in a hot tub, and golfing. The last photo series featured Bieber on stage amid a few snaps of the icon crying. Wife Hailey responded to the final photo series referring to her partner as a "pretty crier."
Hailey's comment was not the only one that sparked reactions in the comment sections of the posts. Fans were quick to make light of the confusing, sporadic series' saying, "I love it when you remember your instagram password," and "We need you back on that stage my guy," while others replied with concern. 
Hailey and Justin have become quite accustomed to public scrutiny of their relationship and continue to support each other. Just last month, a source told Entertainment Tonight that the pair are actively focused on being there for one another through everything. 
Justin capped his very active Instagram day with a photo of the Toronto Maple Leaf's logo, and a screenshot of a song by Tems.
