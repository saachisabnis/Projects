Nails can tell a lot about a girl, but can they tell a baby’s gender? Hailey Bieber might have revealed her baby’s gender in an Instagram post. 
In a Rhode post, Hailey is seen sporting a pink butterfly top and some gorgeous translucent pink nails. Obviously, many fans took to the comments for their takes. “Is she confirming it’s a girl omg,” one top commenter wrote. Another wrote, “it’s a girl or a blush 🎀” On other platforms, people on Reddit wrote, “Maybe girl? She’s wearing a pink top in her first “belly” photos.”

Hailey shared the happy news on her Instagram with a sweet Instagram carousel featuring a pregnancy shoot we believe shot by her husband Justin. Almost immediately, well-wishers and congratulations flooded the comments section. “My heart!!” wrote fellow model Kaia Gerber.
Symon, who hosts Hits 1 LA With Tony Fly & Symon, claimed that the Rhode founder’s “six months pregnant”, meaning Hailey Bieber’s due date would land sometime in August. She does look earlier in her pregnancy in the Instagram announcement, but of course that isn’t timestamped so it could’ve been taken a little while ago. TMZ and Entertainment Tonight also reported that sources with “direct knowledge” of the couple say she’s 6 months along.
“Hailey and Justin are looking forward to finally having a family of their own,” a source told ET. “They’re excited to grow closer, learn together, and share this beautiful experience with each other. They’re soaking up this time and appreciating this moment with close friends and family on both sides.” The two were also spotted with her baby bump growing while she was wearing a white tee.
Rumors had been going around on TikTok/social media in general that because of her outfit choices, Hailey Bieber is pregnant—with some saying she’s 6 months along. “This makes a lot of sense,” one person speculated, “I mean, Hailey – who’s always used to strutting her stuff with her tummy out – has been wearing super baggy clothes, baggy jackets. Even at Coachella she was really covered up. I cannot wait to see what baby Bieber looks like!”
