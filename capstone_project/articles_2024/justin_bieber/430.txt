 Hailey Bieber is back to blonde!

 On Saturday, Sept. 28, the Rhode founder and new mom, 27, unveiled a blonder hairdo in a new selfie posted on her Instagram Stories.

 “Lighter for Fall 💇‍♀️,” Hailey wrote of her new look in the caption, including the hair cut emoji.

 In the photo, she sported honey-blonde highlights in her hair as she wore it loose and looked fresh-faced as she appeared to be wearing no make-up except for a glossy lip. Hailey pouted at the camera while showing off her new look as she sat under an umbrella outdoors.

 The model wore a gray T-shirt along with a pair of tortoiseshell–framed oval glasses and her sparkling “B” initial necklace from Alex Moss.

 Hailey previously has appeared with lighter blonde hair, including in 2021 as showcased in several photos and clips posted on her Instagram taken at the time.

 On Sept. 19, she sported darker hair in a mirror selfie she shared on her Instagram Stories following the birth of her and Justin Bieber's baby boy Jack Blues Bieber in August. 

 “Hi. ✨,” Hailey simply captioned the snap. In the photo, she sported minimal makeup with a pink lip as she wore a black T-shirt and matching manicure and her hair in an updo and held up her phone which sported a pink version of her Rhode lip gloss phone cases.

 Hailey and her husband Justin announced the arrival of their first child, son Jack, in an Instagram post on Aug. 23."WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻," Justin, 30, wrote in the post as Hailey reshared it. 

 Ahead of her new look shared on Sept. 28, Hailey and her husband were spotted taking a break from parenting duties while leaving church together in Los Angeles on Sept. 25. 

 Hailey, still appearing with darker hair, wore a long leopard print jacket and shoulder bag to match, a black Intimissimi top, dark blue baggy jeans and red Adidas sneakers. Justin, meanwhile, wore an unzipped red hoodie, black pants, furry Louis Vuitton boots and a beige fedora.
