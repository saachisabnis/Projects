Miley Cyrus‘ “Flowers” added a record-extending 51st week at No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart dated June 15, 2024, and made more history in the process.

	As it held at the summit, “Flowers” totaled an unprecedented 100 weeks atop all the Billboard radio charts that it has led. In addition to its then-51 frames atop Adult Contemporary, the song, released on Columbia Records in January 2023, ran up reigns of 18 weeks on the all-format Radio Songs chart, 17 weeks on Adult Pop Airplay, 10 weeks on Pop Airplay and four weeks on Dance/Mix Show Airplay. It eventually upped its count to 57 weeks at No. 1 on Adult Contemporary and a staggering 106 weeks atop all Billboard airplay charts.

	“Flowers,” which in February 2024 won the Grammy Award for record of the year, surpassed The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights,” which posted 87 combined weeks atop Billboard airplay charts. The latter, released in 2019, dominated Adult Contemporary for 35 weeks, Radio Songs for a record 26 weeks, Adult Pop Airplay for 20 weeks and Pop Airplay for six weeks.

	“Flowers” is one of 21 smashes that have spent at least 52 weeks, or a full year, combined at No. 1 on Billboard airplay charts. Billboard boasts 25 currently-active radio airplay charts, dating to the Adult Contemporary tally’s July 17, 1961, launch.
