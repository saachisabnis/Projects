Fridays on the Plaza has announced its 2024 concert lineup for this summer.
It can truly be said that there is something here for almost everybody
I've got to hand it to the event organizers on this schedule. There is just about every musical genre represented, and music that appeals to just about every age group. There are even a couple of acts I haven't heard from recently from my youth.
I can honestly say I'm impressed!
As the Fridays On the Plaza website says of the lineup:
So here is the lineup:
Hot Chelle Rae June 7
Hinder June 14
Marc Broussard June 21
Alien Ant Farm June 28
Rose Royce July 5
Sky Of LMFAO July 12
Neon Union July 19
Third Rail July 24
Inner Circle July 26
Aquile August 2
The Barlow August 9
The Blues Dogs August 16
Daya August 23
Ezra Bell August 30
If you've never been to Fridays on the Plaza, the event kicks off at 5:30 p.m. on the Cheyenne Depot Plaza, with the band taking the stage at 6 p.m. Food and beer vendors are available. One change this year is that ID and beer check tickets will be sold in front of the Depot Museum Building, not at the beer dispensing area, as had been the case in the past.
And yes, as with any public event, there are a few rules. You can see those here.
See you there!
