Justin Bieber is giving a look inside his very romantic Costa Rica vacation with his wife, Hailey Bieber, in several new rare photos. 
The Biebers went to Costa Rica for a friend's wedding, but are enjoying their beautiful surroundings and look as happy and as in love as ever. A source told PEOPLE of the trip, "They attended a wedding but also had special alone time," adding, "They seemed very happy."
In several of the photos, fans can see Justin and Hailey closeup as they give a lovey-dovey pose to the camera, while others show a gorgeous sunset on the beach behind a palm tree, and then Hailey in a lovely red dress standing next to the palm tree. Then, in several blurry photos, Justin is having a good time on the dance floor at the wedding. The picture carousel also shows Justin taking in some golf, and a video of Costa Rica's stunning ocean at sunset.
And in another romantic photo, Hailey is seen giving her husband a big kiss below his ear. See the intimate photos below.
Justin and Hailey recently celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary in September, after welcoming their first child together, their son Jack Blues Bieber born in August.
