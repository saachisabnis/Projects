Ryan Reynolds is nothing if not committed to the bit, as proven by his latest shout-out to wife Blake Lively.
Welcome to Wrexham — in which Reynolds, 47, stars alongside Rob McElhenney — won five awards at the 2024 Creative Arts Emmys. While Reynolds wasn’t at the ceremony on Sunday, January 7, his beloved character Deadpool made an appearance to accept the award.
“Wow, Mr. Lively couldn’t be here to accept this broken Emmy, so he sent me on his behalf. First and foremost, Wrexham, we love you. Thank you for letting Rob and the other guy tell your story. Cymru am byth (Wales forever), bitches,” Reynolds said in a speech shared via Instagram, teaming his Deadpool mask with a suit and tie. “I’d also like to thank The Academy for this honor and for not asking us to attend the televised awards show with the real celebrities.”
Reynolds continued referring to himself as “Mr. Lively” in a nod to his wife, with whom he shares four kids: James, 9, Inez, 7, Betty, 4, and a fourth child born in February 2023. The couple, who tied the knot in 2012, are known for playfully roasting each other via social media on a regular basis.
Reynolds’ speech also included a joke about his forthcoming movie Deadpool 3, which will star Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.
“I’d also like to thank FX and Disney for their support and in exchange Mr. Lively promises to not f—k up my next movie,” Reynolds as Deadpool continued. “Lastly, The Oscars, you’re on notice motherf—kers. Maybe we can get a token VFX nod next year, the amount of work on Hugh and Ryan’s face alone is at least worth a nom.”

Fans didn’t get to hear the rest of the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star’s speech, however, as he was swiftly interrupted by Reynolds in his Deadpool mask.
Reynolds and McElhenney became the cochairmen of Wrexham’s football club in late 2020 after buying the team. Welcome to Wrexham premiered in 2022, chronicling the team’s trials and tribulations as a low-level soccer team in Wales. During the show’s second season, which aired late last year, Wrexham was ultimately promoted into the English Football League for the first time in 15 years.
“Rob and I kinda blacked out during this moment, but somehow we’ll never forget it,” Reynolds gushed via Instagram in April 2023 when Wrexham won the national league championship.
