The couple announced the pregnancy in May by posting images from a maternity shoot taken the day of their vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii.
"So I have been waiting for this day," Mallette said at the time in an Instagram video. "And now that they have shared it, I can finally celebrate with y'all. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be a grandma! Oh my goodness."

Hailey Bieber's dad, actor Stephen Baldwin, 58, wrote on his own page at the time, "Love you guys...blessed beyond words...praise God...let's get ready to have some fun y'all."
The couple had exchanged marital vows twice before. Following a whirlwind rekindled summer romance in 2018, they first tied the knot at a New York City courthouse in September of that year. They had a larger wedding with family and friends in South Carolina the following year.
