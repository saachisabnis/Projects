Dan + Shay are celebrating their tenth #1song on the Country Radio Airplay chart with “Save Me The Trouble.” That’s 10 songs in 10 years since they became a duo. In that timespan, they’ve also won 3 Grammy awards and garnered more than 11 Billion career streams.
“Save Me The Trouble,” is the lead single from the duo’s fifth studio album, Bigger Houses, that came out last fall. We talked to them about the new album and Shay told us this:
“We wrote this entire album from a very genuine place. We took it back to the basics. I’ve never been more proud of an album. I feel like this truly marks a new era of Dan + Shay and we hope you guys love it as much as we do.”  :10
