	Last month, Hailey and Justin Bieber welcomed their first child together, a baby boy named Jack Blues Bieber. They shared the exciting news via an Instagram post, in which Hailey’s hand is seen holding her baby’s tiny foot. 

	The model previously opened up about her pregnancy journey in a W magazine cover story. “I probably could have hid it until the end, but I didn’t enjoy the stress of not being able to enjoy my pregnancy outwardly,” she explained of announcing her pregnancy at the six-month mark. “I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn’t feel good. I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life.”

	She added that she was taking advantage of spending one-on-one time with her musician husband. “In the beginning [of pregnancy], it was super emotional for me,” she told W. “Like, ‘I love this human so much. How can I possibly bring someone else into this?’ I’m trying to soak in these days of it being Justin and me, just the two of us.”
