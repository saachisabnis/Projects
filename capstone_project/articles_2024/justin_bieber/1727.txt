Hailey Bieber, née Baldwin, explained why she's not "super close" with the Baldwins anymore.
The model and Rhode founder was born to parents Stephen and Kennya Baldwin — making her uncles Alec, Daniel, and Billy Baldwin. Stephen made headlines earlier this year when he shared a post asking for "prayers" for Hailey and husband Justin Bieber, leading to further speculation about the state of their marriage.
In a new interview with W magazine, Hailey said of her early years in Nyack, New York, "I had a fairly normal childhood. Obviously, I come from the family that I come from, and I always recognized that that was different."
"I’m not super close with my family at this point in my life because I feel like I’m very independent. I’m my own individual now, and I’ve built my own family," she continued. "But when I look back on my childhood and how I grew up, I have very fond, beautiful memories."
Hailey is currently pregnant with her first child. 
Hailey then pointed to the fact that she first signed with a modeling agency at age 17 and moved to New York, where she was surrounded by “a lot of grown people doing very grown things.” She continued, “I started traveling the world, making my own money. I got my own apartment and had to learn how to live on my own and pay bills. That pushed me into adulthood kind of quickly, when most of my friends were just leaving for college.”
