Just when we thought we had our next hair appointments figured out, Hailey Bieber‘s “lighter for fall” hair has us reconsidering everything.
The Rhode founder and new mom took to Instagram on September 28, 2024, to debut her hair transformation. In a casual selfie, Hailey showed off her new lighter locks. “Lighter for fall,” she captioned the snap, adding a blonde hair emoji. While most of us are reaching for darker, richer hues as the leaves change, Hailey’s new look has her embracing sun-kissed, caramel-infused tones that make the transition to the colder season all the more subtle.

Now, it’s not just Hailey’s hair that’s evolving. This hair transformation marks Hailey’s first major style change since welcoming her son, Jack Blues Bieber, with husband Justin Bieber in August 2024. The couple announced their bundle of joy’s arrival with a heartwarming Instagram post, writing, “WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻.”
In recent weeks, the couple seem to be settling into parenthood nicely while still making time for themselves. They were recently spotted leaving church in Los Angeles, with Hailey stepping out in a leopard print jacket (because who says mom style has to be boring) and Justin keeping things casual in a red hoodie.
An insider recently opened up to People magazine about the couple’s transition to becoming parents. “Justin is already a great dad,” the source revealed. “The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for. The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant, was the best ever for Justin. He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them.”
The insider added, “The baby is such a miracle. He’s adorable and doing well. Hailey’s doing well too.”
The couple’s journey to welcoming baby Jack was kept mostly private, with the pair first revealing they were expecting in May 2024 during their vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii. Hailey—who was six months pregnant at the time—stunned in a form-fitting white dress that showed off her baby bump.

 









“I was honestly able to keep it quiet because I stayed small for a long time,” Hailey told W Magazine of her choice to keep the pregnancy under wraps. “I didn’t have a belly, really, until I was six months pregnant, which was when I announced it. I was able to wear big jackets and stuff.”
Now, as new parents, Hailey and Justin seem more connected than ever. Another source told People, “They seem even more in love since the baby arrived.” It’s clear that this new chapter suits the Biebers, and Hailey’s new look proves she’s embracing motherhood fully, with style.
