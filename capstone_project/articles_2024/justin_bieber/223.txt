BuzzFeed put together a list of celebrities who are rude and difficult to work with, according to employees and co-stars. Here are some highlights:
 1.  Jennifer Lopez: She has a list of demands. When she performed for the World Video Music Awards in 2010, she requested a custom speed boat, diamond-encrusted headphones, and a helicopter on stand-by.
2.  Jimmy Fallon: Last year he was accused of creating a toxic work environment on "The Tonight Show" and having "erratic" behavior behind the scenes.
3.  Mike Myers: Someone who worked with him on "Cat in the Hat" says it was a nightmarish experience. He was also distant on set and had a guy who held chocolates for him in a Tupperware container.  (???)
4.  Julia Roberts:  Steven Spielberg says she was difficult to work with on "Hook". The crew referred to her as "Tinkerhell".
5.  Edward Norton: Marvel president Kevin Feige says he lacked a "collaborative spirit" during his time as the Hulk, and that's why he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo.
6.  Bill Murray: He's had a history of causing drama on set.  Richard Dreyfuss called him an "Irish drunken bully" when making "What About Bob?".
7.  Justin Bieber:  Bill Hader and Jay Pharoah say he was the worst guest to work with on "Saturday Night Live". But Bill says Justin was probably just in a bad place when he hosted in 2013.
