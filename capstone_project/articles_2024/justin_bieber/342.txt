Are Hailey and Justin Bieber planning to add to their family? Apparently, not anytime soon as the couple are reportedly in no rush to have another kid months after welcoming their first child together, a son named Jack Blues Bieber. 
A source recently told Page Six that while the Biebers "have discussed having more kids," they are "happy with where things are" right now. The 30-year-old "Peaches" singer and 28-year-old model are also "still adjusting to life as parents of a newborn" and are learning more each and every day. 
The insider added that "they couldn't be happier" and that "Hailey has seen a whole different side to Justin since becoming a father and she's more in love with him than ever."
The Biebers recently spent their first Christmas as a family of three, and the source said that the Rhode founder was "incredibly blessed" to celebrated her first holiday as mom.
"When Justin asked Hailey what she wanted for Christmas this year, she really couldn't think of anything because she has everything she could ever want," the insider said.
Since welcoming baby Jack, Hailey has been in her proud mom era, blinging herself out in several sentimental tributes to her son. Most recently, she unveiled a massive ring with gemstones reflected both her and Jack's birthstones. Other sweet mementos include a bedazzled "JBB" bubble necklace, a golden bangle engraved with his name and a diamond-studded "MOM" ring. Justin has also shared his "papa bear" status with an adorable mug.
