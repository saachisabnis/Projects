We're gearing up for the holidays, and what better way to get in the holiday spirit than to listen to some Christmas tunes?
Some of my go-to holiday songs are Feliz Navidad, Jingle Bell Rock, and All I want for Christmas is You.

Top Christmas Songs
We love all of the Christmas music, but have you ever wondered which is North Dakota's favorite Christmas song? If so, you're in luck --we have the answer.
According to KHON, a study was done by Finance Buzz; it looked at Google Trends to find out what the top Christmas songs were in the country, and in each individual state.
It found that the most popular Christmas song in the country is "Jingle Bells." The source says that 15 states were googling that song the most.
The second top song in the country is "Let it Snow." Six states had it as the top song.
North Dakota
Which holiday song ranks at number one in North Dakota?
Well, it seems we have an appreciation for the classics, because the Peace Garden State's favorite Christmas song is "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."
This song was originally sung by Brenda Lee and it gives us that nostalgic 1950's-era sound. Since it's release in 1958, it's been covered by several artists like Justin Bieber, Amy Grant, LeAnn Rimes, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Simpson, and Kasey Musgraves and Camila Cabello.
According to... it wasn't until recently, in 2023 that the song hit number one one the charts --nearly 65 years after its release.
