The UK takes L.A.! Justin Bieber, Niall Horan, Will Poulter, Cruz Beckham, Chelsea Lazkani, and more celebrities attended the Arsenal vs. Manchester United game at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on July 27.
The West Coast crowd brought extreme energy -- and noise -- to the sold-out venue as the famous rivals kicked off the United States Rivals in Red Tour, where Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-1 with goals from Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli.
The "Baby" singer, the We're The Millers actor, and the Selling Sunset star rooted for the winning team from the Arsenal suite at the 300-acre sports and entertainment destination.
After the match, the football clubs participated in a penalty shootout, which Manchester United won 4-3.
Bieber was all smiles throughout the game in UCLA sweatpants, a black hoodie, and a camouflage bucket hat.
An onlooker tells ET, "Justin seemed like he had awesome time. He was focused on watching the game, but also extremely friendly to everyone in the suite. He was in a very happy mood throughout the night, especially when Arsenal won. After the game ended, he posed for photos with some of the players and then even jumped onto the field for more pictures. He was gracious and kind."
SoFi Stadium is also set to host eight FIFA World Cup 2026 matches, Super Bowl LXI in 2027, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Olympic Games in 2028.
