Jeremy Allen White is looking like a snack — or, rather, eating a snack, while stripping down to just his underwear.
Following in the footsteps of other famous faces, such as Hailey and Justin Bieber, Michael B. Jordan and Kendall Jenner, White bares it all in the latest Calvin Klein ad campaign.
In a series images, which were lensed by fashion photographer Mert Alas, the star of “The Bear,” 32, can be seen hanging out on a New York City rooftop in various stages of undress, wearing a few pairs of Calvin Klein logo underwear.
In some shots, he’s pulling off his jeans while staring right at the camera. In others, he’s casually munching on an apple.
There are also photos of White against a backdrop, showing off his briefs as well as his muscles in a white tank top.
Fans certainly lost their minds over the smoldering images, flocking to his Instagram comments, with one writing, “Where do I send the bill for the phone I just dropped?”
“Thank you, Chef! ❤️‍🔥,” said another while a third wrote, “I want him to wreck my life and I would actually say thank you.”
He also put his acting skills to use in a video campaign featuring the star stripping down out of gym clothes into nothing but his briefs to perform exercises like pull-ups, sparking even more thirsty comments from fans.

The pics can also be seen on Calvin Klein’s spring 2024 men’s underwear collection, which launches today and includes new styles such as Intense Power, Micro Stretch, and Micro Mesh.
While White has seen much success in recent years, most recently starring in “The Iron Claw” with Zac Efron, he revealed to GQ that underwear model wasn’t something unexpected to add to his résumé.
“I didn’t see this in my future necessarily,” the actor said. “Who grows up thinking, ‘Yeah, I’ll be in a Calvin Klein campaign?’”
Still, the Brooklyn native added that he’s always admired the brand’s billboards.
“It’s so massive. I always associated it — and still associate it — with New York City itself.” 
While White is a newly minted model for the brand, he has indeed always been a fan; In August, the former “Shameless” star gushed over “Euphoria” star Alexa Demie’s own campaign for the company, commenting “wow” on the photos on social media.
Recently, White has been spotted spending time with singer Rosalía, sparking romance rumors after he and his wife, Addison Timlin, filed for divorce in May 2023. 
Coincidentally, the 31-year-old “Motomami” singer has appeared in underwear campaigns of her own, modeling for Kim Kardashian’s Skims in 2022.
