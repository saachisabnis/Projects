LITIGATION

Bird Marella 

University of Michigan

My guilty TV pleasure “Keith Morrison solving a cold case on Dateline.”

TALENT

Jackoway Austen

On the TV side, BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg inked a deal for a new animated series at Netflix, while Reservation Dogs breakout D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai has signed to star in the Alex Garland feature Warfare.

If I were a TV lawyer, I’d be … “An actor.”

CORPORATE

Willkie Farr

UCLA

	Epstein believes things are not as bleak in Hollywood as they may seem. “There’s hope on the horizon. The stock market is a leading indicator, and that gives you a sense of where a lot of smart people think this is going,” he says, adding that interest rates appear to be heading toward a decline. And recent headwinds haven’t stopped him from brokering deals like Ryan Reynolds’ $1.35 billion sale of Mint to T-Mobile. 

Hollywood figure I’d trade places with “John Legend.”

TALENT

Lichter Grossman 

Harvard

	Client Steven Soderbergh has been keeping Feldman busy lately: He’s handled back-to-back Sundance bidding wars for the indie filmmaker’s Presence (which landed at Neon) and a spy thriller starring Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender (set up at Focus Features).

	Fox is “genuinely funny,” says Ted Lasso star Brett Goldstein, who’s shooting the second season of his Apple TV+ series Shrinking, and just reupped his overall deal with Warner Bros. TV. “He’s always pitching to be a writer’s assistant on one of our shows, and I’m like, ‘You can have it, but I need you to do the deals!’ ” Fox also does the deals for a roster that includes Abbott Elementary’s Tyler James Williams (a client since the actor was just 16), Reacher star Alan Ritchson, Saltburn auteur Emerald Fennell and Fallout co-creator Geneva Robertson-Dworet.

TALENT

Cohen Gardner 

University of Virginia

	Gardner has plenty of prestige filmmakers on his roster (Bong Joon Ho, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi), but it’s the deal he architected for Ryan Coogler’s untitled reunion film with Michael B. Jordan that is legacy-making. The package — “an epic, monumental, game-changing director’s deal,” Gardner calls it — saw the winning bidder, Warner Bros., agree to revert the project’s copyright back to Coogler in 25 years.

My guilty TV pleasure “Seinfeld reruns.”

After a lawsuit from the first accuser was resolved without Bauer having to pay to settle the case, Holley helped get prosecutors to bring extortion charges against a second accuser. And although Danny Masterson was found guilty of rape, she may have saved him years in prison by undermining testimony from a former girlfriend, the only victim of the three for which there was no conviction.

White Lotus showrunner Mike White was among his first clients 30 years ago. He’s picked up quite a few more since, including Ryan Gosling, Paul Giamatti and Will Arnett, whose podcast, SmartLess, with Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes has turned into a nine-figure business. Says Offer, “To see people trying to find outlets for their creativity turn them into huge, huge deals is exciting.” Other clients: Tom Holland, Brie Larson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Gal Gadot and Ewan McGregor.

Client Daisy Ridley will be back for more Star Wars, and Mahershala Ali will be boarding the next Jurassic World and toplining Marvel’s Blade … someday: “That deal was in 2019, and they still haven’t shot it, which is pretty much the craziest thing in my professional experience,” Weiser says.
