The Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra’s 67th season is dedicated to engaging audiences of all ages and extending its reach beyond Boulder with diverse orchestral music. Their upcoming performances have been crafted to showcase the unique qualities of the region, with an emphasis on creating an inclusive experience for concertgoers both on stage and off. Among the highlights are Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, a new series of genre-blending repertoire, educational Discovery concerts, and an array of family-friendly concerts.
From September 2024 through May 2025, the Boulder Phil’s season, led by Music Director Michael Butterman, will feature internationally acclaimed soloists, distinct venues, dynamic and soul-nourishing programming, and unforgettable artistry from the area’s finest musicians.“There’s so much to Boulder and the greater Front Range – the academic excellence of our universities; the vibrancy of the arts and culture landscape; the natural beauty that surrounds us,” says Mimi Kruger, Executive Director of the Boulder Phil and native Coloradan. “The season was built to reflect the distinctive energy and character of the region.”
Come for the music, stay for the beauty
In a world with constant challenges, the beauty of orchestral music offers a profound reminder that art is not an escape from life but a way to discover the beauty that isn’t always apparent. The Boulder Philharmonic brings this beauty to the forefront, starting with Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto in D Major, featuring Sphinx Competition winner Amaryn Olmeda, followed by Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 with Alessio Bax, a First Prize winner at both the Leeds and Hamamatsu International Piano Competitions.
In January, Grammy Award-winning violinist Tessa Lark, renowned for her astounding range, technical agility, and musical elegance, will grace the stage. Lark is celebrated not only for her classical prowess but also for her deep roots in Appalachian and bluegrass music, reflecting her Kentucky heritage. The season concludes in May with a powerful performance of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, featuring the Boulder Chorale and an exceptional lineup of vocal soloists: Abigail Nims, Tess Altiveros, Kameron Lopreore, and Peixin Chen.
Music Director Michael Butterman’s commitment to contemporary composers is evident with two world premieres. Local composer John Hein’s Moons of the Giants will be paired with Holst’s The Planets, while Stephen Lias’s Wind, Water, Sand will make its debut. Notably, in 2017, the Boulder Phil premiered Lias’ All the Songs that Nature Sings and performed it at Washington D.C.’s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
New family programming
Live music has a lasting impact on children and their families, fostering creativity, wonder, and shared experiences that resonate for years to come. This season, the Boulder Philharmonic is excited to introduce programming made to inspire and captivate people of every generation. 
On October 27 and October 30, step into a ghostly world with the Phil’s “Bewitching: Halloween Extravaganza.” Directed by Principal Guest Conductor Gary Lewis, this concert offers a family-friendly program that blends the festive, spooky, and whimsical. The orchestra will perform a mix of classics, including “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” and music from beloved films, such as Danny Elfman’s “This Is Halloween” and John Williams’ iconic themes from “Harry Potter.” Children are encouraged to participate in an orchestra-led costume parade, adding an extra layer of fun and engagement to this Halloween celebration with a musical twist.
Looking ahead to the summer of 2025, the Boulder Philharmonic will make its debut at Denver’s Levitt Pavilion with an outdoor screening of Wallace & Gromit, accompanied by live orchestral music. Wallace & Gromit films have been delighting audiences for over 30 years with their charming stop-motion animation and quirky British humor. Since Nick Park introduced the characters in 1989’s Academy Award®-nominated A Grand Day Out, the duo has become a beloved fixture in animated film, including The Wrong Trousers, which alone won 13 awards, including Best Short Film. With Levitt’s spacious lawn seating and breathtaking views of Denver’s skyline, families can bring blankets, enjoy a picnic, and immerse themselves in the entertaining world of Wallace & Gromit under the stars.
The Nutcracker: Timeless tradition
As the holiday season approaches, the Boulder Philharmonic prepares to continue a beloved custom with Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker in collaboration with the Boulder Ballet. This annual presentation has become more than a seasonal event; it is a treasured experience that connects generations of Front Range residents. Kellan Toohey, the orchestra’s new Principal Clarinetist, fondly recalls his first encounter with the Boulder Phil at just four years old, during a performance of The Nutcracker. Whether newcomers or longtime attendees, audiences are invited to join in reliving the magic and forging traditions with their loved ones.
Shift series: Music without boundaries
The Boulder Phil’s Shift Series is a groundbreaking concert experience designed to move beyond the traditional orchestral setting. Featuring three distinct programs – Groove, Americana: Redefined, and Brass and Brews – it offers an eclectic mix of genres performed by string ensembles and a brass quintet. These concerts are held in some of the most celebrated venues across the Front Range, including Planet Bluegrass, Northglenn Arts Parsons Theatre, and Dickens Opera House, all of which are deeply connected to the communities they serve.
Shift not only showcases the extraordinary talents of the Phil but also brings people together through a shared love of music and the unique perspectives of the audience and guest artists. Adding to the series’ unique appeal, local string artist Enion Pelta-Tiller, known for her diverse musical background, joins the musicians to further enrich the experience of Americana at Parsons Theatre.
The series will feature a wide range of styles, including modern hits by artists like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, and delves into music that blends gospel, jazz, blues, country, and global influences. Whether enjoying a brass ensemble paired with a cold brew or exploring the roots of American folk, the Shift Series offers a dynamic musical journey that breaks free from conventional norms.
This 2024/25 season is poised to be an exploration of both the familiar and the new, offering moments of reflection, inspiration, and beauty. Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra tickets and subscriptions available at BoulderPhil.org and by phone at 303.449.1343. Masterworks tickets for students of all ages are $10.
