Hailey Bieber showed off her growing baby bump during a weekend outing with husband Justin Bieber in New York on Saturday (June 22). The Rhode Skin founder wore a flowing, satin, high-neck gown that perfectly accentuated her growing belly as she exited a plane with the "Sorry" hitmaker by her side. 
The soon-to-be-mother was seen holding the bottom of her stomach as she cherished precious moments with Justin, and her built-in plus one. Hailey continued to serve looks throughout the weekend, donning a neutral form-fitting gown for a Rhode Skin promotional event in NYC on Sunday (June 23) and a sheer, lace jumpsuit complete with an over-sized leather jacket for yet another outing with the "Ghost" artist. 
The fashion icon announced her pregnancy in a sentimental series shared to Instagram six weeks ago. The photos in question depict the lovebirds at their vow renewal in Hawaii in May, looking extremely excited at the thought of welcoming baby Bieber into the world later this year. 
Since the announcement, Hailey has not been shy about sharing pregnancy symptoms and cravings with followers on social media. The star revealed that she craves "egg salad on top of a pickle with hot sauce" and has experienced intense lower-back pain as her pregnancy progresses. 
The sex of the child, and a due date have yet to be announced as the world readies for the highly-anticipated arrival of baby Bieber.
