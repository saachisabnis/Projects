Justin and Hailey Bieber chose the perfect family costume for their son’s first Halloween.
On November 1, the 27-year-old model shared a few “October things” in an Instagram roundup from the month, starting with her immaculate Kim Possible costume. Hailey transformed herself into the Y2K cartoon character with a vibrant red wig, black turtleneck, and low-slung green cargo-pants. She topped off her look with all the accouterments a basic, average girl needs to save the world: pversized gloves, a belt bag, and a Rhode iPhone case to match her peptide lip treatment. (“Kim P is an espresso girly,” Hailey wrote on her Instagram Stories.)
But where would Kim Possible be without her sidekicks? In slide three Justin Bieber and baby Jack channeled Ron Stoppable and his pet naked mole rat, Rufus. The parents have yet to share their son’s face with the world, but it was easy to keep the baby’s features hidden in his snuggly pink hooded onesie. Call them, beep them, if you want to reach them.
“Jack as Rufus… We’re obsessed! 🤍🥹😭,” one fan commented on the Instagram post.

This wasn't the only way Justin and Hailey Bieber got their son into the holiday spirit. In slide eight, Hailey shared a photo of Jack’s little legs in a Nightmare Before Christmas onesie and little white socks.
This post marks the first time Hailey Bieber has shared a photo of her son to her Instagram grid, though she shared another photo of his legs to her IG Stories on October 31. In that snap Jack is buckled into a carseat wearing a hot pink onesie and an “I Voted” sticker on his foot.
“Happy Halloween," Hailey captioned the snap. “Get out there and vote!”
Onesie alert!
