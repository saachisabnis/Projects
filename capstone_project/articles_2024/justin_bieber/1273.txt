At the Us Weekly and Pluto TV Reality Stars of the Year party — which went down on Thursday, October 10, at the Highlight Room in Los Angeles — Francesca Farago gave bold new meaning to her TV show, Too Hot to Handle in a gauzy lace dress that showed off her baby bump and black lingerie underneath.
The racy, lacy look fit Farago like a glove – and was strikingly similar to a sheer black catsuit that Hailey Bieber wore earlier this year while expecting her first child with husband Justin Bieber.
Designed by Alessandra Rich, Hailey’s body stocking featured strategically placed ruffles at the bust. But not even a heavy leather trench (also by Rich) could hide its undeniable sex appeal.
Perhaps Bieber and Farago were simply channeling their inner Rihanna. After all, Bad Gal RiRi set the bar for hot mom-to-be maternity style back in 2022 when she attended the Dior fashion show at Paris Fashion Week dressed in smoldering sheer new-season lingerie and little else.
Let these expecting celebrities serve as evidence that modern approaches to maternity fashion include figure-framing cocktail dresses that showcase your pregnancy shape. Indeed, a lacy little black dress, like Farago’s, is something you can (and should!) wear long after your due date.

Back at the Us Weekly and Pluto TV party, the same sartorial sentiment was shared by another reality star fave: Summer House’s Lindsay Hubbard. Like a master class on dressing a growing bump with glamorous aplomb, she sent cameras flashing on the red carpet in a clingy nude gown with light-catching shimmer.
It may have been maternity’s answer to the “naked dress,” but the drama was in the details. See the sweetheart neckline with a cinched effect that accentuated Hubbard’s curves, or how the flowing silhouette with swaths of draped fabric at the drop waist delivered a goddess-like feel.
The results were fabulously flattering – and for a final flourish, Hubbard wore a matching nude neck scarf. Styled backwards like a choker, it made a fashion-forward statement coming and going.
