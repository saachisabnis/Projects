Pop Star, The Kid Laroi, has announced that he has to postpone multiple tour dates this week, including his show this Friday, May 31st, in Colorado due to an illness. As he recovers, he has announced the new Denver date.
2020 was an interesting year but it did have some bright spots. One of those was music. While locked down, the creativity of artists, old and new, had more time to really write and perfect new music, than some had in years.
We got to see many awesome debuts through live virtual concerts, or viral videos on social media. We were introduced to some awesome new music and artists in that weird time period, including Australian rapper, singer, and songwriter, The Kid Laroi.
Laroi's massive hits like  "Stay" which featured Justin Bieber, was one of, if not the biggest pop song of 2022 which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for multiple weeks. You almost couldn't turn on pop radio, or scroll through social media without hearing that tune and he's continued to crank out big hits.
Sadly, the young pop star has come down with a bad illness and has tested positive for COVID-19. Full post below...
As noted above, the Denver date for the "First Time Tour" will be moved from Friday, May 31st, to Saturday, June 13th at the Fillmore in Denver. You can still get tickets for the newly rescheduled date, and all original tickets for the May 31st show will be honored for the new date as well.
Ironically, Kid's last tour through Colorado was at the Blue Arena, where it was also postponed. If this happens again, he may just elect to leave Colorado off of future tours, so let's hope he gets better soon and Colorado isn't a bad luck state for him.
