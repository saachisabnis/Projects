“WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻,” the singer announced on Instagram
Late Friday night, Hailey and Justin Bieber shared that baby Bieber was born, officially making the couple parents. 
The “Baby” singer announced the exciting news on Instagram, revealing a photo of Hailey holding their newborn son’s tiny foot. “WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻,” he wrote, sharing their baby’s adorable name. Hailey shared the same photo on her Instagram Story.
Throughout the couple’s pregnancy journey, neither Hailey nor Justin disclosed the baby’s gender, although fans interpreted many of Hailey’s social media posts as clues that she was having a girl. Their announcement reveals that their baby is, in fact, a boy—and it also hinted at a meaningful family tradition. 
Like Justin and his father, Jeremy, baby Jack continues a familial streak of “JB” initials. Those three aren’t the only ones, either: Justin’s half sister Jazmyn Bieber and half brother Jaxon Bieber share the same initials as well. Notably, Jack is also Jeremy’s middle name, giving the baby’s name another sentimental layer of meaning. 
Jack is Hailey and Justin’s first child together. In the months since announcing Hailey’s pregnancy, the couple seems to have made the most of their last few months alone. Recent snaps showed them cuddling up during a baby shower, coordinating their couple style, and even jetting off on a romantic vacation together. That said, the duo seemed thrilled to welcome a third member into their family.
“They’re ready to become parents. They’re planning for the baby’s arrival and it’s very cute,” a source close to Justin told People last month. “They are super committed to their marriage, but also to being the best parents possible.”
