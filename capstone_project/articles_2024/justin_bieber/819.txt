Scooter Braun, renowned for his influential role as a top music manager in the music industry, has officially announced his retirement from management.
The decision marks a significant shift for Braun, 42, who cited a desire to prioritize family time and his responsibilities as CEO of Hybe America, a major entertainment conglomerate, Forbes noted.
This move comes nearly a year after speculation began about his departure from long-term clients like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.
Braun, whose management career skyrocketed in 2008 upon discovering a young Justin Bieber online, revealed Monday that he will no longer manage clients under SB Projects.
Instead, he plans to transition client oversight to Allison Kaye and Jennifer McDaniels.

Last summer, reports surfaced that several high-profile clients were parting ways with Scooter Braun.
Sources indicated that Bieber, a client since the beginning of his career, and Braun had not communicated for months.
Similarly, rumors circulated about Ariana Grande severing ties with Braun. However, industry insiders clarified that Braun was refocusing on his expanded role as CEO of HYBE America, the US division of the South Korean entertainment powerhouse behind BTS, according to USA Today.
Braun acknowledged these shifts in a statement, attributing his decision to retire from management to a need for more personal time with his children and a reevaluation prompted by a client's desire for new career directions.

His client roster expanded to include stars like Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande, and he ventured into film production with documentaries such as "Never Say Never" and "Dancing with the Devil."
In a pivotal move, Braun's Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group in 2019, igniting a public feud with Taylor Swift over ownership of her master recordings.
Swift publicly denounced Braun's acquisition, leading to her decision to re-record her original albums to regain control of her music legacy.
The acquisition of Big Machine Label Group by Ithaca Holdings triggered a contentious period between Braun and Taylor Swift, marked by accusations of bullying and control over her artistic work, per People.

Despite these challenges, Braun emphasized his gratitude for the artists he has collaborated with, including Bieber and Grande, pledging continued support for their future endeavors.
His shift from day-to-day management reflects a broader commitment to evolving roles within Hybe America and personal priorities.
