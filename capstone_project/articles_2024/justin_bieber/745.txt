Hailey Bieber discovered a painful new pregnancy symptom on Wednesday (June 12) amid promoting Rhode Skin's new pocket blush. 
The soon-to-be mother shared a frowning selfie on her story with the caption, "So who was going to tell me about the lower back pain," followed by an array of dizzy and pregnant emojis (as seen on Page Six). Hailey and husband Justin Bieber announced that they were expecting their first child together last month in an adorable photo series from their intimate vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii earlier this year. 
The baby Bieber photo reveal in question features video footage of the pair kissing followed by Justin taking pictures of pregnant Hailey, draped in a stunning lace wedding gown surrounded by beautiful green hills. The 27-year-old makeup mogul has since kept the public updated with pregnancy symptoms and cravings, revealing a few weeks ago that her favorite snack was "egg salad on top of a pickle with hot sauce," and asking followers not to judge. 
In addition to unveiling her recent symptoms and go-to snacks, Hailey shared an absolutely glowing photo dump, displaying what she's been up to the last couple of weeks as she gears up to bring new life into the world. The stunning snaps depict the model's growing tummy in a beautiful, pink, butterfly crop top, and another with an iced coffee resting on "little bean" as she basks in the sun. 
The baby's sex and due date has yet to be revealed as Hailey and Justin (and the rest of the world) anticipate the arrival of baby Bieber.
