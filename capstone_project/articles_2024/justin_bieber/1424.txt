Hailey and Justin Bieber are reportedly "overjoyed" after welcoming their first child together.
The Biebers recently became parents with the birth of their son Jack Blues Bieber, which they revealed in a heartwarming post on Friday (August 23). A source close to the "Peaches" singer told People that both mom and baby are doing well and that the Biebers are thrilled with becoming parents to their "miracle" baby, adding that Justin is "already a great dad."
"They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well," the source said. "Hailey's doing well, too."
The arrival of their newborn son was a long time coming for the couple as they reportedly had been hoping to add to their family for a while before learning they were expecting. The couple, who have been married since September 2018, first revealed they were expecting their first child together in May.
"The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for," the source said. "The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant was the best ever for Justin. He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them."
The Biebers announced the birth of baby Jack in a post on Instagram, with Justin sharing a sweet photo of Hailey holding their newborn's foot with the caption "WELCOME HOME."
The couple weren't the only ones excited about the newest member of their family, per People. Following their announcement, Justin's mother, Pattie Mallette, shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) congratulating the couple and adding "I LOVE YOU FOREVER BABY JACK." Hailey's father, Stephen Baldwin, reshared the post, writing, "Amen, Congratulations to you and may God continue to bless our family."
