Hailey Baldwin Bieber is explaining her decision to wait until she was already six months pregnant to reveal that she and husband Justin Bieber are expecting their first child together.
In a new cover story for W Magazine's Special Edition Summer Issue, the 27-year-old model shared that the choice to keep her pregnancy under wraps for the first six months added a level of "stress" to her life that she didn't enjoy, per People. 
Though she noted she "probably could have hid it until the end," especially as her "small" baby bump didn't really start showing until she was "six moths pregnant" when they announced the news, Hailey said she "didn't enjoy the stress of not being able to enjoy my pregnancy outwardly."
"I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn't feel good," she said. "I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life."
The Biebers, who first tied the knot in 2018, announced in May that they were expecting their first child together, sharing a sweet video and photos documenting their intimate vow renewal in Hawaii that also included a look at Hailey cradling her growing baby bump in a lacy white dress. 
Since the pregnancy reveal, Hailey has continued to document her journey, from strange cravings and "painful" symptoms to pregnancy hacks for dealing with the summer heat.
