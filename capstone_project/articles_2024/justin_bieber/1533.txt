On November 22, Hailey Bieber turned 28-years-old and she celebrated with a group of friends and some delicious martinis. On Saturday, the model shared a carousel of pictures from her birthday week, which included shots of her birthday look. For her party, Hailey wore a black leather coat with a fluffy, luxurious lining that covered her cuffs and collar before running along the coat’s arms in a fringe. 
The Rhode founder wore it without a shirt, creating a plunging neckline. Underneath, she had on a tiny skirt that just disappeared under the coat’s hem, and a pair of black sheer stockings. 
On her feet, she wore a pair of black and nude pointed-toe heels. For accessories, Hailey wore a diamond necklace and several silver and diamond earrings. She had her hair partly up and drawn away from her face, and wore a pale blue gel manicure with tiny green olives, sticking with the martini theme.
On her Rhode business account, the model offered a tutorial on her makeup look for the evening, which included Rhode blush in the shades “freckle” and “toasted teddy,” as well as her newest shade of peptide lip tint, “cinnamon roll.”
On her birthday, before the party commenced, Hailey shared a clip of her fitness routine in her Instagram Stories. She and husband Justin Bieber recently welcomed their son, Jack, and Hailey has quickly returned to her previous toned figure. Her trainer, Kirsty Godson, had Hailey working with a resistance band and a balance ball on a yoga mat. She captioned the video of her workout, “bday burn.”
Jack was born in August. In October, his mom was feeling sentimental about her pregnancy. Hailey shared a carousel of pictures from when she was still pregnant on Oct. 7 from various photoshoots.
“reminiscing on the belly today 🥹🐥🐣,” she wrote.
