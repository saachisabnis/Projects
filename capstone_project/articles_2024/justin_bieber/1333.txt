Delightful enough to please the palate of pop prince Justin Bieber, Krispy Kreme was founded in 1937 by Vernon Rudolph, who started by selling his doughnuts to grocery stores — that is, until people passing by his bakery asked for his doughnuts directly from the source. After Vernon cut a hole in an outside wall and began selling doughnuts to customers on the sidewalk, the rest was history.
This isn’t the first time Krispy Kreme has celebrated its birthday by letting its trademark assembly line of deep fried joy to its customers. In 2023, it celebrated its 86th birthday by offering a dozen Original Glazed doughnuts for — you guessed it — 86 cents. Krispy Kreme is also known for its frequent freebies and discounts, including during Leap Day, World Kindness Day, April Fools' Day and more.
