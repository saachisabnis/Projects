Hailey Bieber's father has appealed for prayers for the model and her husband Justin Bieber.
Stephen Baldwin caused concern amongst fans of the couple when he shared a post asking Christians to seek spiritual help for the pair because of the "special challenges" they face.
The Usual Suspects actor shared a post from All Things Possible Ministries founder Victor Marx, which featured a video of the "Believe" singer playing guitar and singing to "I Could Sing of Your Love Forever" by Delirious? and the Hillsong Worship and over the top the words: â€œChristians, please when you think of Justin and Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord."
The 57-year-old star didn't elaborate on his Instagram Story post or offer any further words of his own about the couple.
Hailey previously told of how Stephen and her mother, Kennya Baldwin, banned her from going out with Justin, who she went on to wed in 2018, alone but her older sister Alaia agreed to cover for her.
Speaking in documentary The Biebers on Watch about their first kiss, she recalled: "The first time we kissed, we were in New York and we had gone to dinner together. I called my parents to ask them if I could go and they said no. They were like, 'Absolutely not, you're not going to hang out with Justin by yourself, that's not happening.' ... My older sister kind of covered for me and was like, 'Oh yeah, she's gonna sleep over at my apartment and it's all good' ... she covered for me and we went to dinner and didn't get caught. We were just hanging and we went back to watch a movie and we kissed!"
