Who is Love Island's Ciaran Davies? Here's everything you need to know about Love Island series 11's runner up including his age, job, height, Instagram, his rugby injury and where he’s from. 
Ciaran Davies proved sceptics wrong as the 21 year old made it all the way to the Love Island 2024 summer series final with his now-girlfriend Nicole Samuel, despite being the youngest islander.
He and Nicole came second, narrowly missing first place to Mimii Ngulube and Josh Oyinsan. The Welsh chap made some good friends in the villa but most notably had a slight feud with former TOWIE star Joey Essex.  
Now that he's out in the real world with Nicole here’s everything you need to know about him, from his age, job, height, rugby team, Instagram and more.
Age: 21
From: Pencoed, South Wales
According to Gymfluencers, Ciaran is 6 foot 5 inches. 
Job: Surveyor
When he's not working as a surveyor he plays for Rugby Union team Tondu RFC.

Ciaran’s a big fan of banter, with the boys but also with the ladies in his life, “I say I’m a wind-up merchant, only to a certain extent. I never want to come across as being horrible to someone or hurt someone's feelings."
This explains one of his and Nicole's first arguments, 'eggy boff' - if you know, you know.
"Hopefully they can have a good joke… I feel like if they can get past that, I feel like there could be quite a few good connections,” he said.
