Wise Brothers—–Chattanooga, TN
When it comes to celebrities, some are really nice while others are just plain difficult divas. Buzzfeed compiled a list of A-Listers who are awful people to work with and be around.
1.  Jennifer Lopez:  She has a list of demands.  When she performed for the World Video Music Awards in 2010, she requested a custom speed boat, diamond-encrusted headphones, and a helicopter on stand-by.
2.  Jimmy Fallon:  Last year he was accused of creating a toxic work environment on “The Tonight Show” and having “erratic” behavior behind the scenes.
3.  Mike Myers:  Someone who worked with him on “Cat in the Hat” says it was a nightmarish experience.  He was also distant on set and had a guy who held chocolates for him in a Tupperware container.
4.  Julia Roberts:  Steven Spielberg says she was difficult to work with on “Hook”.  The crew referred to her as “Tinkerhell”.
5.  Edward Norton:  Marvel president Kevin Feige says he lacked a “collaborative spirit” during his time as the Hulk, and that’s why he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo.
Others who made the list include Justin Bieber, Bill Murray and Terri Hatcher.
