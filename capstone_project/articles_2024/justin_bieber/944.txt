Hailey and Justin Bieber's romance has been subject to unfounded rumors and speculation of a rocky relationship for years, even after getting married and welcoming their first child together, but they find all the drama to simply be "noise."
A source recently revealed to People how the "Peaches" singer, 30, and the Rhode founder, 28, react to rumors that their marriage is in trouble, especially three months after welcoming son Jack Blues Bieber. Rather than give any of their energy to the negative remarks, they tend to ignore and even laugh at what some people have to say about their relationship.
"They laugh at the constant divorce rumors," the source said. "It's annoying but just noise."
The Biebers first tied the knot in a New York City courthouse in September 2018, saying "I do" once again a year later with a larger wedding in South Carolina. In September, Hailey, who has previously slammed divorce rumors, celebrated the fifth anniversary of their second ceremony by giving a new look at her "magical" wedding gown. 
In August, Justin and Hailey became first-time parents with the birth of their son Jack. Since then, they have been settling into their roles as mom and dad, with Justin celebrating being a "papa bear" and Hailey unveiling several sweet tributes to her son.
