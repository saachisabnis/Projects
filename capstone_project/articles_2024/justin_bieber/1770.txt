Photos obtained by People depict the Rhode Skin founder absolutely glowing in a mirror selfie posted to her Instagram Story on Thursday (September 19), offering fans and followers a subtle "Hi" ahead of a series of skincare product promotions. 
The stunning snap in question features the new mom pursing her lips as her bangs, gold hoop earrings, and large diamond "B" necklace complete her look. 
The "Baby" hitmaker shared news of the arrival of he and Hailey's little bundle of joy on August 23, beaming, "WELCOME HOME" aside a photo of Jack's foot wrapped in a blanket. One week after the child was born, a source close to the couple told People that the new parents were "overjoyed" with their "miracle" baby. 
While an exact date of birth was not disclosed, one of the couple's friends accidentally revealed a clue about the baby's birthday just over a week after he was born, leading fans to assume he entered the world on August 22.
