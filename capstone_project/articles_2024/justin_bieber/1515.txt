While conducting a routine traffic check in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York City, Officer Jonathan Diller, 31, died. This time, this tragedy took the New York Police Department by shock.
The tragedy happened on Monday night, leaving the city in mourning and reigniting concerns about how law enforcement handles mental health emergencies.
The incident began when a terrified mother called 911 in a panic, saying that her 19-year-old son was acting strangely and going through a serious mental health crisis.
Authorities say that this conversation was the starting point for a number of incidents that quickly spiraled out of control and into danger.
During a press conference that followed, New York Police Department (NYPD) Chief of Patrol John Chell called the occurrences that were taking place "hectic, chaotic, and dangerous". This description highlighted the seriousness of the current situation facing law enforcement.
A dedicated member of the Queens Community Response Team of the New York Police Department, Officer Diller found himself at the center of this escalating violence. On Monday, just before six o'clock in the evening, he encountered 31-year-old Win Rozario while carrying out a routine traffic stop. Unfortunately, his mental health issues were disregarded due to the strain of the circumstances, according to CBS News.
