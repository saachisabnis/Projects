So, she was exposed to nature’s beauty and the simplicity of country life. She has always been powerfully associated with music. 
Her grandmother, a highly professional opera singer, subsequently introduced her to the world of music and since then, Swift has been writing songs since she was young. 
She was inspired by country artists like Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and the Dixie Chicks as people who were going to help her form a country-pop style in the future. 
Swift’s parents understood her potential and therefore decided to move from their hometown to Nashville, Tennessee, to provide support for her music career.

Consequently, Taylor Swift became a global phenomenon.”1989″, in which the artist once again took the 58th Grammy trophy for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.
