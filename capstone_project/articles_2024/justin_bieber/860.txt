Benny Blanco revealed he makes Selena Gomez her favorite steak in hopes of getting lucky. 
“I woke up early this morning and I was like, ‘I want to do something nice for my girlfriend,'” the “Open Wide” author told his Instagram followers Monday. 
“I was thinking, whenever I want to put a smile on her face or get laid, I just make her steak.” 
Step-by-step Blanco, 36, walked his audience through his recipe as he also made a side of Caesar salad with homemade croutons and dressing. 
“Alright so she’s working today, so my plan is I’m going to make her the f–king best steak dinner she’s ever had put it in a little f–king Tupperware, tip-toe into her work, sneak in and then just fully surprise her,” he said. 
After putting the final touches on the “Only Murders in the Building” star’s meal, the producer rushed out of his home.
Blanco then explained there was a change of plans and he’d be delivering the food to Gomez’s home because she had the day off.
The foodie showed himself tiptoeing inside the “Who Says” songstress’ residence because she was asleep when he arrived. 
He then grabbed a paper towel and marker to write a sweet note for his girlfriend to leave on her nightstand alongside his care package. 
“I love you! Sleep well! I made you steak,” Blanco wrote along with a heart.
When Gomez, 31, woke up, she commemorated the sweet gesture with a snap of her beau’s note posted to her Instagram Story with a simple white heart.
“Finally someone treating Selena the way she deserves❤️,” one person commented.
“Every woman needs a Benny 😍😍😍,” another gushed. 
“Boyfriend material❌ Husband material✅,” a third wrote. 
The “Eastside” artist, who took his romance with the Emmy winner public in mid-December 2023, previously revealed another way to Gomez’s heart was with fried pickles.
Making a homemade batch for her on Valentine’s Day 2024, he told his followers, “Fry pickles get laid.”
Gomez and Blanco haven’t been shy about flaunting their relationship as they often pack on the PDA on social media. 
In February, the “Lose You to Love Me” hitmaker shared intimate photos of Blanco holding onto her chest as she sat on his lap.
She’s even shared a snap of them passionately making out backstage at the 2024 Golden Globes in January after losing the best actress in a television series award to “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri. 
Despite her loss, she declared herself a winner, captioning the snap with her boyfriend, “I won.”
Gomez has previously gushed over her newfound romance, claiming Blanco is the best she’s ever had. 
“He’s still better than anyone I’ve ever been with,” she wrote on Instagram in December. “He has treated me better than any human being on this planet,”
The “Same Old Love” singer was previously linked to Justin Bieber and The Weeknd.
