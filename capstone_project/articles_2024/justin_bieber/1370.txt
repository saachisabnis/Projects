Selena Gomez is shutting down those John Schlossberg dating rumors. 
The singer and actress, 31, reacted to a fan account claiming “a few tabloids” have reported that she once had an affair with John F. Kennedy’s only grandson between 2020 and 2021.
“Never met this human sorry,” she commented Friday under an Instagram post about the rumor. 
Schlossberg, also 31, has not publicly responded to the accusation and it’s unclear if he was dating someone during that time frame, while Gomez was seemingly single from 2020 to 2021. 
Page Six has reached out to Gomez’s reps for comment but did not immediately hear back.
The “Same Old Love” singer is currently dating music producer Benny Blanco. The couple has been an item since last summer but Gomez did not reveal their romance until December 2023.
She proudly announced the news via a string of Instagram comments, claiming Blanco, 36, was her “absolute everything” and “the best thing that’s ever happened” to her.
“He has treated me better than any human being on this planet,” she wrote at the time.
Since then, Gomez has not been shy about showing off their love, often taking to social media to share PDA pics with her beau.
Most recently, the “Single Soon” singer showed off a photo of Blanco cuddling her and kissing her head while they celebrated his birthday in March.
She also shared a touching Instagram tribute on his special day. 
“Happy birthday baby! Your emotional endurance, positive disposition, unbelievable talent (that blows me away), undeniable humor and loving, kind heart absolutely kill me,” she captioned a carousel of photos with him. 
“I love you @itsbennyblanco 🎂🥹 .”

Gomez seems to be head over heels for the music executive, as she recently revealed that she found someone who makes her feel “rare.”
“Benny is a great communicator, is honest and open with Selena, and listens to her,” a person close to the stars told Entertainment Tonight in December. 
“He’s respectful, isn’t a player, and not in it for the attention or fame.”
The insider added that Blanco “doesn’t care about any of that and Selena sees that and really trusts him.”
Gomez’s last serious relationship before Blanco was with The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye. The musicians were together for 10 months before calling it quits in October 2017. 
She also famously dated Justin Bieber on and off from 2010 to 2018.
