#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
A popular platinum-selling artist is set to the hit the stage later this fall in Indiana.
I was 13 years old in 2012, when all the girls my age were obsessed with teen heartthrobs, like the members of One Direction, Justin Bieber, and, of course, Hunter Hayes. In fact, I can still remember their posters on display at local retailers, as well as the CD advertisements. I met my wife in 2018, and later learned she was not immune to the craze. As soon as she found out that Hunter Hayes would be in Indiana later this year, I was already being sent links to purchase tickets.
According to All Music, Hunter Hayes was was born in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana in 1991. He's had widespread success over the years, namely with his number one country single "Wanted," which went quadruple platinum in 2012. At the time, he was the youngest male act to ever top the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart. He's released an assortment of genre-bending music since, and has a new album set to be released later this month titled VILLAIN.
Hayes will perform at the Jasper Community Arts Center on Saturday, September 28, 2024, at 7:30 p.m. According to the venue's website, it was founded in 1975 as part of the City of Jasper and became the only arts commission in the state to be officially recognized as a department of the city. It's definitely a great place to see a show, and I can assure you, there isn't a bad seat in the house.
As I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate Hunter Hayes as a musician. In addition to being a great vocalist, he can also play over 30 instruments. I'm sure Hayes will put on a great show here in southern Indiana. If you plan to attend, the Jasper Community Arts Center is located at 951 College Ave. in Jasper, Indiana. You can learn more about the venue and how to purchase tickets here.
