Blake Lively has accused her "It Ends With Us" co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and a retaliatory smear campaign to cover it.
Lively claims that Baldoni, who directed the film, coordinated a PR campaign which her lawyers called " 'social manipulation' designed to 'destroy' Ms. Lively's reputation" after she took issue with on-set behavior, according to a 62-page legal complaint.
The behavior took place on the set of "It Ends With Us," adapted from the Colleen Hoover book. The film features Lively as florist Lily Blossom Bloom, who falls head over heels in love with a seemingly perfect neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid played by Baldoni, and she reconnects with her childhood sweetheart, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar). Below the surface, the film grapples with disturbing patterns of domestic abuse.
Lively filed the legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department as a precursor to a lawsuit. "I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted," Lively told The New York Times in a story published Saturday.
The allegations range from unwanted discussion of Baldoni's genitalia to criticism about Lively's weight, including calling her personal trainer four months after the birth of her fourth child for her to lose weight. They include allegations that Baldoni's PR team used family connections to get critical stories placed about Lively in media outlets as well as employed a team to make it seem as if regular people were posting items critical of Lively.
USA TODAY reached out to Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman for comment.
In a statement provided to The New York Times, Freedman called Lively's allegations "completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media." He said that Baldoni's production company, Wayfarer Studios, did not retaliate against Lively and "only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity."

In a meeting on Jan. 4, the complaint says that Lively and her team discussed in detail behavior by Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath. Neither of the men denied the behavior, according to the filing, but agreed to end the behavior, and resumed filming the next day. Among the asks detailed in the complaint:
No more showing nude videos or images of women to Lively or her employees.
No more mention of Baldoni and Heath's previous "pornography addiction" or Lively's lack of pornography consumption to her or other crew members.
No more discussions to Lively and her employees about "personal experiences with sex as it relates to spouses."
No more descriptions of their own genitalia to Lively.
No more inquiries to Lively's trainer about her weight.
No more personal, physical touching or sexual comments by Baldoni or Heath to Lively or others.
No more improvising of kissing.
Lively to have a representative on set to monitor any nudity, sex or violence with Baldoni.
No more entering Lively's trailer while she is naked.
No more adding of sex scenes or oral sex.
Blake Lively files legal complaint: Actress claims her 'It Ends With Us' co-star Justin Baldoni sexually harassed her
In the filing, Lively's lawyers allege that Baldoni hired crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan and her company The Agency Group to carry out an online smear campaign.
Sony provided talking points for the actors to use during film promotion, including focusing on the resilience of the character played by Lively instead of the theme of domestic violence, the complaint says. Lively followed those guidelines, while Baldoni focused on domestic violence. Then his team worked to share stories that Lively didn't care about the issue of domestic violence.

The filing also alleges that stories were planted to "shift" the narrative in support of Baldoni. Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel had a text exchange when Daily Mail published a story with the headline "Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED? String of 'hard to watch' videos that have surfaced following 'tone deaf' Q&A to promote 'It Ends With Us.' "
"You really outdid yourself with this piece," Abel said. Nathan responded, "That’s why you hired me right? I’m the best."
The filing claims Abel wrote: "He wants to feel like she can be buried," to which Nathan replied: "You know we can bury anyone."
In another instance in the filing, Baldoni texted Abel a social media post and thread that accused Hailey Bieber of bullying behavior and wrote: "This is what we would need."
Abel responds that she spoke to Nathan about it and discussed focusing "on reddit, TikTok, IG.”
The complaint says that Wayfarer Studios' co-founder, co-chairman and leading financier Steve Sarowitz divulged at the film’s New York premiere that "he was prepared to spend $100 million to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family."
The complaint included a scenario planning document that included "planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in (Lively's) circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully’ into getting what they want.”
According to the filing, when Lively became aware of the retaliation, she experienced "mental, physical, professional, and financial harms that continue to this day."
She says that she was forced to cancel public appearances to avoid talking about the harassment, including backing out of her scheduled hosting of "Saturday Night Live" in September.
The complaint says: "She also has been experiencing repeated and painful physical symptoms as a result of this experience. (Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds), too, has been affected mentally, physically, and professionally by his wife and children’s pain. Worst of all, however, has been the impact on their young children, who have been traumatized and emotionally uprooted in ways that have substantially impacted their well-being."
