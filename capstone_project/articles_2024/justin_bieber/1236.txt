Anyone up for Game Night?
When you think of the iconic yellow banana-shaped pouch of Bananagrams, you’re not just thinking of a game; you’re thinking of the creative genius of Kendra Harrington, a Dartmouth native whose fingerprints are all over the global brand.
For nearly 13 years, Harrington has been at the heart of Bananagrams, blending creativity, design and a love for games in her role as the company’s first full-time designer.
Officially titled “Creative Explorer,” Harrington’s job is as dynamic as it sounds.
She wears many hats, from game designer and graphic artist to content creator and marketing assistant.
“We’re a small company with only 16 employees, but we’re a big global brand,” she said. “Laura Incatasciato and I handle everything visual, from product development and social media to sales assets and illustrations.”
Harrington’s passion for design was sparked at Syracuse University, where she initially pursued surface pattern design. A professor recognized her talent and encouraged her to pivot to communications design, one of the school’s most demanding programs.
“I’ve been a designer for over 20 years, working for start-ups, Hasbro, and freelance projects, and I’ve never been bored,” she said.
Harrington’s first solo project at Bananagrams was My First Bananagrams, a game designed to introduce younger players to the fun of wordplay. The project earned a prestigious Platinum Oppenheim Award, one of the industry’s highest honors. She’s also proud of Cobra Paw, the company’s second-best-selling game, and Spiky Dastards, which she co-invented with colleague Anthony George.
In total, Harrington estimates she’s helped design or contribute to over 15 games, though the number feels even higher when factoring in the countless projects that never made it to market.
Working at Bananagrams comes with perks: free games, travel to conventions like PAX and ComicCon, and of course, plenty of game nights.
The job also offers unique brushes with fame.
“I designed Big Letter Bananagrams for Judi Dench, a family friend of our founder, Rena Nathanson,” Harrington said.
She’s also created custom pouches for actress Marcia Gay Harden, a devoted fan of the game, and designed a t-shirt for the Broadway cast of SIX.
The game’s fan base includes A-listers like Justin Bieber, Zooey Deschanel, Andrew Garfield and even the Kardashians. Bananagrams has also made appearances in popular shows and movies, including Billions, Manifest and Peter Rabbit.
Despite her impressive track record, Harrington isn’t slowing down.
“I have a list of game ideas…shhh,” she joked, hinting at more exciting projects on the horizon.
For Harrington, the joy of working at Bananagrams lies in the creativity, the connections, and of course the games.
“It’s product development at its finest – you get to drink, play and decide what’s next,” she said.
While the banana pouch may be the face of the brand, it’s clear that the heart of Bananagrams is powered by people like Harrington who are dedicated, inventive and always ready for the next big idea.
