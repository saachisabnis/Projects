The couple viewed the pregnancy as a 'fresh start' for their marriage, a source said recently.
As OKMagazine.com reported, Stephen caused drama for his daughter when he reposted a video from Victor Marx, the founder of All Things Possible Ministries. 
The video featured Justin playing guitar along with the caption, "Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord."
Stephen's post sent Instagram followers into a tailspin ‚Äî and one user even commented, "The media is reporting that hailey and Justin are divorcing based off the post you shared asking for prayers. Hopefully not." 
Another asked, "Why pray for H and J ? üòÆ I don‚Äôt understand." 
Hailey shut down 'blind items' about her marriage in her own Instagram story post.
As rumors and speculation about Hailey and Justin's marriage quickly spread across social platforms, Hailey eventually took to her Instagram stories to set the record straight about "blind items" regarding the state of her marriage.
"Just FYI the stories and constant 'blind items' I see on TikTok are 100 percent of the time wrong. Made out of thin air‚Ä¶ come from the land of delusion," the 27-year-old wrote in an Instagram story post on March 5. 
"So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they‚Äôre always false. Sorry to spoil it."
