It makes for great fireside reading this fall.
Thanks, New York Times: The Gray Lady issued a mealy-mouthed correction for calling NewsNation a “right-leaning” network — it shows you just how far Left much of the media is that being in the center is now “right-leaning.”
Sometime this weekend, think for a few minutes: Who is Vice President Kamala Harris?
A social justice warrior who wants to eliminate private health insurance
A tough prosecutor who will shoot anyone who breaks into her house
A gun owner who will shoot anyone who comes in her house but who once said she wants to confiscate guns
A failed progressive politician turned mainstream presidential candidate who wants to give you $25,000 for a house
A racial justice warrior who wants the state to pay for the transgender surgeries of prison inmates
A pragmatic former attorney general who went after “transnational gangs,” the border czar who oversaw an open border, a presidential candidate who wants to close the border or a 2019 presidential candidate who wanted to decriminalize illegal crossings.
It’s a trick question, really. Harris wants you to believe she is anything you want her to be.
Peggy Noonan calls her “empty” in The Wall Street Journal.
Even Oprah got annoyed at her word salad nonanswers in a town hall last night.
Click here to watch two minutes of circle talk that means nothing.
Or her thoughts on what being an American means? Watch this and double-check.
Whether that’s good enough for undecided voters will decide this election.
Watch tonight: Kellie Meyer joins us live with her reporting from Sauk County, Wisconsin, to see what undecided voters there care about the most.
Home to the Wisconsin Dells, it has picked the winner in every presidential race since 1992.
Then Harris rallies in dark blue Madison at 7:30 p.m. ET. Trump spoke twice in our hour this week, and we brought you that. Fair is fair — we’ll bring you Harris as well.
See above if The New York Times has any questions.
Unforced errors: The above may not matter as Republicans keep doing stupid 💩
Chris Cillizza has a great breakdown of a scandal that has nothing to do with Trump but could cost him the whole election.
Trump supported Mark Robinson’s campaign, calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids.”
Local reporting indicates the skeletons in Robinson’s personal history were well known.
He’s not attending the Trump rally tomorrow — so much for loyalty.
Trump picked Herschel Walker, Dr. Oz and Kari Lake.
They are awful candidates who lost or will lose winnable races.
Last night at an antisemitism event, Trump said it’s Jews’ fault if he loses — we are back to undisciplined Trump.
Despite Harris saying to Oprah that her staff would be upset by saying anybody who came into her house would be shot — the staff loved it.
As The Wall Street Journal notes, liberals love guns these days.
The staff also knows The New York Times won’t ask any of the questions they would if Trump said a similar thing:
What kind of gun? When did she buy it?
Is the gun registered, does she have a concealed carry permit, and who approved it?
Did she take gun safety courses?
Where is it kept in the house because there were kids around?
Is the gun locked up at night?
Where is the gun when Harris is at campaign events?
Is it currently in house at the Naval Observatory or back home in California – is it in a safe there? Loaded?
Has the Secret Service seen the gun?
Those questions are all the more relevant considering she once supported unannounced “safety checks” on gun owners. You can watch the video here.
The latest Fox polling shows “immigration” second only to high prices as the single most important issue in the election.
Retired Border Patrol sector chief Aaron Heitke testified Wednesday in front of Congress accusing the Biden administration of covering up the number of known terrorists encountered at the border.
Watch tonight: Heitke joins us with what else he was asked to cover up!
Accused sexual predator Sean Combs (better known as Diddy) is under suicide watch at the same jail where sexual predator Jeffery Epstein died by suicide while on suicide watch.
The New York Post reports an officer involved in the Miami raid of Diddy’s mansion says the rap star was as bad as Epstein.
As we learned from Epstein — you don’t have drug-fueled sex parties alone.
There are celebrities that come to the parties and engage with the other women there
Like at his “white parties”
There are enablers
There are drug dealers
There are security guards
There are drivers
There are people who run the video taping system
There are pilots, chefs and maids who witnessed it all
The Washington Examiner has a good breakdown of the Democratic political establishment who should be awfully worried right now.
Will they get any uncomfortable questions? No, but they should.
I could go on, but the celebrities that used to fight over invites to his parties are nowhere to be found.
Much like the famous people who hung out with Epstein at his island and flew on his planes
Their problems all went away when Epstein “committed suicide”
As Stalin said, “Death is the solution to all problems — no man, no problem.”
Bonus coverage: Where is Justin Bieber in all of this?
For the first time in 11 months, President Joe Biden hosts a Cabinet meeting … to celebrate his accomplishments and push his team to run through the tape.
The vice president didn’t show up, but the first lady did.
Remember, these are the same people who swore up and down the president did cartwheels and trigonometry behind closed doors before the June debate.
Irony alert: The meeting comes the day after Wall Street Journal reporting shows the Biden administration finally realized you can’t make a deal with terrorists and there won’t be a cease-fire in Gaza to save Biden’s foreign policy legacy.
The Wall Street Journal says, “Another problem is that, according to Biden administration officials, Hamas makes demands and then refuses to say ‘yes’ after the U.S. and Israel accept them. The intransigence has severely frustrated negotiators, who increasingly feel the militant group isn’t serious about completing an agreement.”
But wait — the Left will blame Netanyahu.
Watch tonight: The message will be something like, “Failure on cease-fire — but we have the internet.” Here is the Biden administration’s video celebrating, among other things, rural internet access.
