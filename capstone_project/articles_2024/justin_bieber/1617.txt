Beyonce has made history again after becoming the first black woman to top Billboard’s country music chart.
The Grammy winner achieved the feat after her new single Texas Hold ‘Em reached No 1 on the country airplay chart this week. She dropped the song on February 11 – during the Super Bowl – along with her other single 16 Carriages, which debuted at No 9 on the same chart.
