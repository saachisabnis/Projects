For Justin and Hailey Bieber...it's the little things. 
The "Sorry" hitmaker recently gifted his beautiful wife a plant (as seen in photos obtained by People) for absolutely no other reason than to shower the mother of his child with love. 
The Rhode Skin founder shared a snap of the pot to her Instagram Story on Tuesday (October 22) praising her husband for the kind gesture aside the small plant in all its green-potted glory. 
The adorable pair welcomed their first child into the world in August and have since been soaking up life's most precious moments with baby Jack Blues Bieber, stepping into their role as parents with admiration and adoration of their creation. 
In September, Justin shared a snap of a "papa bear" mug, and earlier this month, his 27-year-old bride payed tribute to their newest little addition with an October photo carousel quipping, "It's October and I'm someone's mom." 
The series in question depicts a handful of self-care snaps and selfies featuring a new necklace with baby Jack Blues' initials to pair with the model's signature "B" for Bieber necklace. 
The new parents have yet to share a photo of their child to social media as they continue to soak up life's blessings and enjoy the "little things" with each other and Jack Blues.
