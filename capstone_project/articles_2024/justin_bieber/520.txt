Justin Bieber has paid tribute to rapper Chris King, who died aged 32.
The singer shared a video of the pair hugging in December captured in Los Angeles, that was originally posted on his friend’s Instagram.
‘Love you bro. This one hurts,’ wrote Bieber.
‘Please keep his family in your prayers. See you in paradise brother.’
Californian King, real name Christopher Cheeks, previously revealed that he’d lived in Bieber’s home for around a year and a half almost a decade ago. 
‘Glad some people never change no matter what. All love, forever extended family,’ King said of Bieber in 2023.
