Eminem’s new single “Houdini” is the No. 1 song in America on many Billboard charts. It might not rule all of them—including the Hot 100, which is usually seen as the most important ranking in the country—but it’s become a huge hit right away, nonetheless.
“Houdini” easily launches atop the Digital Song Sales chart this week. Eminem’s latest starts in first place on the ranking of the bestselling tracks, as it sold 49,000 copies in the first seven days it was available in the U.S.
With another No. 1 to his credit, Eminem advances again on the list of the most successful artists in the history of the Digital Song Sales chart. He has now accrued a dozen leaders, and that sum ties him with several other musical superstars.
With 12 No. 1s on the Digital Song Sales tally, Eminem is now on the same level as BTS and Beyoncé. All three acts have reached the summit with a dozen different cuts, and they jointly claim the sixth-most champions ever.
Before “Houdini” debuted atop the purchase-only list, Eminem was already matched with Katy Perry. Now, that pop superstar is steady with her 11 No. 1s, but she sits alone in her position.
Taylor Swift leads all artists, with 29 No. 1 smashes on the Digital Song Sales chart. Behind her come Nicki Minaj (with 17), Rihanna (14), and both Drake and Justin Bieber, who are tied with 13 champions each.
“Houdini” is one of 91 tracks that Eminem has sent to the Digital Song Sales list. 41 of those have cracked the top 10, and fewer than half of those have worked their way to the throne.
