Justin Bieber is seemingly teasing that he has new music in the works, and fans can't contain their excitement.
The "Peaches" singer took to his Instagram on Sunday (October 20) where he shared several photos from what appears to be a music studio. In the carousel of pics, Bieber can be seen concentrating as he hovered over a keyboard, sound boards and other production equipment while another shows him sipping a cup of coffee as he focuses on something out of frame, per People. 
Though he didn't share any official update about new music, only captioning the pics with photographer Rory Kramer's name, Beliebers quickly flooded the comments with their hopes for a forthcoming project. The Grammy winner hasn't released a solo studio album since 2021's Justice.
"KING BACK IN THE STUDIO?" one excited fan wrote, while another exclaimed, "We are ready!!!!!" Other fans expressed their excitement for new songs while also sharing their wishes for Bieber to take care of himself, such as one commenter who said, "we love you and we're impatient to hear your new music, first of all take care [of] yourself, you wife and your son JBB."
The "Ghost" singer's post also included a sweet black and white photo of him with his wife Hailey Bieber as she leaned in for a kiss. The pair recently welcomed their first child together, a son named Jack Blues Bieber, and have reportedly been "in a happy bubble" since the birth of their "miracle" baby.
