Jermaine Dupri ended the week by teasing a new record of his featuring Nelly, Ashanti and Juicy J. According to the legendary producer, the song will be featured in an EP that he is preparing to release through Mass Appeal.
“I’m in here trying to this mix done on my new record featuring Nelly, Ashanti and Juicy J,” he stated.
“It’s an EP on Mass Appeal. The first single [featured myself] and Jacquees. [It’s] called ‘Pick It Up’ This is going to be the second song. That’s what we’re on today.”
Jermaine Dupri is riding high after adding another number-one record to his resume. During the holiday season, the Dupri-produced R&B track, “Made For Me,” by Muni Long hit number one on the R&B radio charts. More recently, his iconic collaboration with Usher, “Confessions Part II,” was touted as the top R&B song of the 21st century by Rolling Stone.
“Just as Michael Jackson’s Thriller inspired a generation of pop stars, from Beyoncé to Justin Timberlake, Usher’s 2004 album, Confessions, was a definitive statement of the early 2000s, arguing (a la MJ before him) that urban music could occupy the center of pop music,” he wrote on Instagram.
“Confessions sold more than 10 million copies, and the LP — and Usher’s subsequent singles — charted the course for acts such as Chris Brown, Justin Bieber, Drake, Summer Walker, and many more to follow.”
