Plains eighth graders showcased their critical thinking, problem-solving, engineering design and basic coding skills during the 2024 Robotics competition.  
The Sumobot Tournament, which began three years ago, was designed with a specific goal in mind: “To combine everything that they have learned this whole semester and be able to write the correct code to survive the Sumobot Tournament or at least survive a little,” teacher Kati Mitchell said. 
Students started with a collection of Lego pieces, which had to include a central processor (the robot's brain), sensors, and various attachments to disable their opponents. The key to success in the competition lies in how students program or code the processor.  
Using blocks of code, students had access to 70 different blocks, each controlling a specific function, such as turning, moving forward or backward, and responding to sensor input. With so many blocks to choose from, the possibilities for programming the robots were virtually endless.  
One of the most crucial combinations involved a color sensor. The tournament took place on a 36-inch white circle with a black outer ring. The robot had to be programmed to sense the color change and turn around before leaving the circle, or it would be disqualified. 
To compete, students had to complete six modules (or chapters) in advance. Seventeen students participated in this year’s competition, with nine robots built and named.  
The robots included "George" built and programmed by Mauriella Adams and Madison Hill; "Patricia" created by Layla Alexander and Deven Johnson; "Walle" made by Kiara Alexander and Deven Johnson; "Justin Bieber" designed by Miranda Dawson and Emery Josephson; "Chorlie" built by Jeremiah Erikson and Reese Meredith; "Eve" created by Karissa French and Aliah Owens; "Tyrone" built by Gary Rehbien; "Kyme" designed by Kylie Silva and Emmie Tucher; and "School Bus" made by Kameryn Malmend and JD Warta. 
Each student passed the necessary modules, receiving feedback to improve their coding and prepare for the next competition in January, which will feature a drag-racing event. The day’s winner was "Patricia," the robot built by Alexander and Johnson.
