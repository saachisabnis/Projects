Fans are learning more about the birth of Hailey and Justin Bieber's first child together thanks to a new detail that one of their friends accidentally let slip.
Adwoa Aboah, a pal of the famous couple, reportedly revealed a new hint at the birth date of the Biebers' newborn son, Jack Blues, per Page Six. The British model made the revelation on Instagram this week while sharing the happy news that she had welcomed her own little bundle of joy, her "stunner of a daughter" named Shy that was born August 23. 
Hailey showed support for her friend's growing family in the comments, writing, "baby Shy!!!!" to which Aboah replied, "a day apart 💔💔💔🐣🐣🐣." The comment led followers to conclude that Jack was born August 22, the day before the couple revealed they had welcomed their first child together.
The "Peaches" singer announced the birth of his and Hailey's son in an adorable post on his Instagram on Friday (August 23). Hailey also shared the sweet photo on her own Instagram Stories alongside a teddy bear and blue heart emojis.
"WELCOME HOME," Justin captioned a photo of what appears to be Hailey holding the newborn's foot. "JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻"
The couple, who tied the knot in September 2018, are reportedly "overjoyed" with their "miracle" baby, a source close to the musician told People. Justin is also reportedly "already a great dad" to their "adorable" newest addition.
