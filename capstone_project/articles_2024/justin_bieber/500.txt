As we get ready for one of the biggest summers of live music ever in Colorado, The Kid Laroi just announced that he's coming back to Colorado to kick it all off. "Stay..." For all the deets!
To say the least, 2020 was an interesting year around not just Colorado, but the world, right? While insane, it did have some bright spots, specifically in the music department.
With so many of our favorite artists getting the extra downtime to really write and put together new music, or even getting to make their debuts through viral videos on social media, live virtual concerts, etc., we were introduced to some incredible new music and artists in that crazy year.
Australian rapper, singer, and songwriter, The Kid Laroi, was one of the top new artists' breakouts in that time, and he's coming back to Colorado to kick off the summer of 2024
Cranking out bops like "Without You" or "Stay" which featured Justin Bieber (above), The Kid Laroi was everywhere. "Stay" in particular, was one of, if not the biggest pop song of 2022-2023. It's still one that you can't help but sing along to, and sing along to you'll get to.
After an incredible show last spring at the Blue Arena in Loveland, the Kid Laroi is coming back through Colorado with his "The First Time Tour." The highly anticipated return to Colorado will take place at the Fillmore on Friday, May 31st.
Tickets will go on sale to the general public this Friday, March 29th, at 10 am. Pre-sales start March 26th and VIP tix go on sale Wednesday, March 27th.
