Today, Grammy-winning, Oscar-nominated, Lagos, Nigeria-based singer, songwriter, and producer Tems releases the official music video for her latest single "Love Me JeJe," now out via Since '93/RCA Records.
A lead single off Tems' much-awaited debut studio album: "Born In The Wild," "Love Me JeJe" has already accrued more than 5.8 million collective streams worldwide since it first arrived last week.
The new MV for the single, which Tems directed herself, is the artist's way of recognizing her childhood and upbringing in Lagos, Nigeria. The location's stunning visuals bleed through and meld as one with the earworm beats of the summertime dance anthem.
The video also features and gives a nod to Seyi Sodimu, whose 1977 hit Nigerian classic of the same name was the principal inspiration for and is an interpolated version of Tems' latest bop.
Tems first teased and performed "Love Me JeJe" in her recent Coachella Music Festival debut. This performance was showered with rave reviews from the likes of Billboard, which said that she delivered a "striking debut set" with her "warm, powerful voice."
The Nigeria-based artist also surprised the Coachella crowd with the appearances of both Justin Bieber and Wizkid, who performed their smash hit with Tems: "Essence."
Ahead of her debut album's release later this month, Tems released 2 new tracks: "Me & U" and "Not An Angel," which is the first set of full-length follow-ups to her 2021 EP: "If Orange Was A Place."
Since first releasing, "Me & U" has now amassed over 45 million streams and joins "Not An Angel" in the momentous milestone of hitting No. 3 on Billboard's US Afrobeats Songs Chart.
