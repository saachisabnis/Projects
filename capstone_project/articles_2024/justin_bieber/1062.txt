Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has now earned $261.6 million globally, topping Michael Jackson’s This Is It ($261.2 million) to become the new highest-grossing concert film ever. The feat is no surprise, as Swift's movie already became the top-grossing concert film in America the week it opened with $97 million in October — easily beating previous champs, Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never, with $73 million, and This Is It with $72 million. The Eras Tour film also earned a nomination for the Golden Globes’ new Cinematic & Box Office Achievement prize on Sunday night, but lost to Barbie.
