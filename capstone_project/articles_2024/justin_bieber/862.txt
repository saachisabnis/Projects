Beyoncé has broken a record with her new single "Texas Hold 'Em."
Beyoncé is making Billboard history with her latest song "Texas Hold 'Em."
The new country song topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart this week. Her No. 1 on the chart makes her the first Black woman artist to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, and first woman to top both the Hot Country Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts since the genre chart lists began in 1958, according to Billboard.
The only other artists to have ever topped both charts are Morgan Wallen, Justin Bieber, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Ray Charles, Billboard notes.
"Texas Hold 'Em" wasn't the only Beyoncé song to land a spot on the country chart with "16 Carriages" debuting at No. 9. “Texas Hold 'Em” is an up-tempo country and Western stomp, while "16 Carriages” is a soulful slow-burn with ascendant organs and steel guitar.
Beyoncé isn't the first woman of color in the country genre, as artists like Mickey Guyton and Brittney Spencer have seen success in recent years, according to Rolling Stone. In terms of charting history however, country still remains predominantly male and white.
Just last year, Luke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" made history by marking the first time a song solo written by a Black woman has topped Billboard's Country Airplay chart since the ranking was first put out in 1990.
Chapman also became the first Black songwriter to win a CMA Award for song of the year.

Monkey Move
Another quirky, longtime South Congress store has moved on from the historic street — but this time, it's reopening in another busy area nearby. After 20 years on SoCo, the toy and other fun things store Monkey See, Monkey Do! is now open at 2810 Menchaca Rd.
Two opening weekend celebrations will get things started. On Saturday, May 3, the store will start selling just-released Sonny Angels collectible figures. (Guests are encouraged to arrive early in case of a long line.) Then a Star Wars-themed party on May 4 invites guests in for free hot dogs and Lone Star beer.

The new location shares a triangular island of land between South Lamar Boulevard, Menchaca, and Barton Skyway with three other businesses: Papalote Taco House, ThunderCloud Subs, and the Soup Peddler. Foot traffic won't match the former tourist destinations, but Austinites pass this area often, especially if they live in South Austin.
A release sent by founder Brandon Hodge points out that Big Top Candy Shop, his store a few doors down on the same block, will not be relocating. It remains on South Congress Avenue, and Hodge teases some new candies and sodas to come.
Locals know there's a miasma of anxiety on South Congress about small businesses being pushed off the street. Hodge himself has raised the alarm as president of the South Congress Merchants Association. However, he intentionally sets a happy tone for talking about the move for Monkey See, Monkey Do! He emphasizes that it was a voluntary move.
“We are incredibly excited for this move,” said Hodge in the release. “With all due respect to our incredible culinary neighbors on South Congress, after two decades we have decided to explore new lunch options. While we will definitely miss having our fill of Gueros, Home Slice, and Magnolia Café every day, we felt it was high time to explore some of the menus South Lamar has to offer.”
Longtime store manager Steven Almaguer, is also looking forward to good eats, and paints a picture of what it was like to work in a tourist location.
On the one hand,” he said, "selling toy accordions and lava lamps to celebrities makes for an interesting workday, but on the other hand, we haven’t had a Thundercloud Subs right next door, so we’re really looking forward to being their new South Lamar neighbors.”

On a more serious note, Hodge does discuss the experience watching South Congress evolve.
“During our kitschy little toy shop’s two decades on South Congress, we have witnessed extraordinary changes to the surrounding retail landscape,” he said. “When we first got our start down here, we were drawn by the cheap rent and amazing community of scrappy upstart businesses that didn’t quite fit in anywhere else, and we made the best of it together.”
Nostalgia aside, this move could be great for local shoppers who don't want to brave South Congress. The new spot has free parking, and a playground across the street at Amy's Ice Creams offers another pit stop on a more relaxed outing.
If this all seems sudden to neighbors, it's because the store taken shape very quickly. The relocation was only announced in mid-April, and finishing touches that only went up a day or two before opening included a new sign and the recognizable "enlightened monkey" statue.
Operating hours at Monkey See, Monkey Do! are 11 am to 7 pm Mondays through Thursdays, 11 am to 9 pm Fridays and Saturdays, and 11 am to 7 pm Sundays.
