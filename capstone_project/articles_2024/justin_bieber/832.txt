Hailey Bieber is addressing criticism of her marriage to Justin Bieber, slamming rumors that the couple "hate each other" and are heading for a divorce as they prepare to welcome their first child together.
In a new interview with W Magazine published Tuesday (July 23), the 27-year-old model and expectant mother got real about the intense criticism she has faced throughout her relationship with the "Peaches" singer, per E! News. 
"People have made me feel so bad about my relationship since day one," she said. "'Oh, they're falling apart. They hate each other. They're getting divorced.' It's like people don't want to believe that we're happy."
The Rhode Skin founder and the Grammy Award winner first tied the knot in September 2018, but constant speculation on the state of their marriage continues to "hurt."
"I used to try to act like it hurts less and less," she said. "I've tried to think that you get used to it at a certain point, that this is what's going to be said and this is how people are going to be. But I realize that it doesn't actually ever hurt any less."
The couple announced in May that they are expecting their first child together, sharing the happy news with photos and video from their intimate vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii that featured a visibly pregnant Hailey cradling her growing baby bump in a white lacy dress.
Elsewhere in the interview, Hailey spoke about why she waited until she was already six months pregnant to publicly share the news, revealing that she could have waited "until the end" if it didn't feel like she was "hiding this big secret" from everyone.
