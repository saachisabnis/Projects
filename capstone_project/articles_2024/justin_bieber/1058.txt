Police in Nashville, Tennessee, are searching for a suspect in a shooting that killed rapper Chris King and injured another man on April 20.
King was killed while hanging out in an alleyway with a group of his friends, including the other victim, between Hayes and Church streets in Nashville, police said in an April 20 statement.
It was in the alley that three other men — whom King’s group did not know — approached the group, police say.
“The (surviving) 29-year-old victim reported the group was hanging out cordially for some time before the three suspects attempted to rob his group of friends,” according to a release from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. “It was then that he heard gunfire and realized he was struck.”
The 29-year-old victim has not been publicly identified by police. King, 32, died after being taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
In a new statement on April 22, the Nashville Police Department said one of the three suspects in the shooting has been identified as 19-year-old Adrian Cameron Jr.
Cameron was out on bond in connection with the September 2021 murder of Josh Evans, Nashville PD said, and had an ankle monitor as part of those conditions.
"Data from the monitor shows it was cut off shortly after Saturday’s shooting," Nashville PD said.
Police are asking for info on his whereabouts or on the identities of the other two men. The Nashville PD did not immediately respond to TODAY.com’s request for comment on April 24.
In a post to his Instagram story on April 21, pop star Justin Bieber mourned the death of King, whose birth name is Christopher Cheeks.
“Love you bro. This one hurts. Please keep his family in your prayers,” Bieber posted, the Los Angeles Times reported. “See you in paradise brother.”
Bieber and King were once roommates, King previously shared on social media, and lived together for more than a year “almost 10 years ago.”

“Glad some people never change no matter what,” King wrote in a post celebrating his friend in December 2023. “(A)ll love, forever extended family.”
Other celebrities also mourned King’s death.
“I love you until we meet again twin!” fellow rapper Trippie Redd posted to Instagram. “I would not be where I am today without @whoischrisking he introduced me to @elliotgrainge & @milothelight 🙏 and he had the best energy always he had so many friends and it shows I love you guys for supporting one of my best friends ever my brother.”
In the comments, Machine Gun Kelly responded to Redd, writing that “Chris (King) was rare.”
Actor Keke Palmer also posted about King, writing about their time coming up together in the industry alongside an old photo of her video chatting with King from years ago.
“I wish I had more photos but it’s actually perfect because this is exactly how it began,” she wrote. “I can’t believe I’m saying rest in peace. This is terrible. I really don’t know what to say. I just want to share that I loved you and I remember all the city walk, grove moments.”
Palmer seems to be referencing two Los Angeles shopping landmarks — both City Walk and The Grove are outdoor pedestrian malls.

Your kindness was present no matter what room you were in, everybody was and wanted to be your friend. We will miss you until we meet again, rest heavenly brother.”
