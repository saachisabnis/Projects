Sean Kingston is in legal trouble after the police raided his Florida mansion and arrested him and his mother. They are suspected of cheating companies out of goods and property worth around a million dollars.
The Jamaican-American rapper — whose birth name is Lisean Anderson — remains in a jail in San Bernadino County, California, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, Yahoo! reports. Kingston faces an extradition hearing to return him to Broward County in Florida to face 10 charges of fraud for allegedly obtaining an extravagant automobile, television, bed and other merchandise through fraudulent means. He is currently being held without bail.
According to TMZ, the charges also include engaging in systemic fraud to obtain $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from a car dealer for a Cadillac Escalade, $100,000 from First Republic Bank, and $86,000 for a customized bed, among other items. 
Kingston’s mother, Janice Turner, was released following her arrest at Kingston’s estate after posting a $160,000 bail. She is facing eight charges related to the alleged crimes.
The rapper rose to fame in 2007 with his debut single, “Beautiful,” which rocketed to number one on the Billboard pop chart. Kingston also boasted the top 40 hits “Eenie Meenie” with Justin Bieber and “Take You There” that same year from his eponymous debut album. However, Kingston has reportedly failed to score a major hit song in more than a decade.
