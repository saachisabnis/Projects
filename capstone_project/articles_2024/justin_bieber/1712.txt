The Sussexes attend the Invictus Games One Year To Go Event on February 14, 2024 in Whistler, Canada
The Sussexes graced the slopes of Whistler Mountain, Canada, yesterday, marking the one-year countdown to the upcoming Invictus Games. The royal couple, wrapped up against the sub-zero temperatures, shared smiles and held hands while engaging with Invictus Games athletes in a show of support for the Invictus events, which ‘provide opportunities for recovery through sports.’ The trip follows the news that the couple will be taking ‘Sussex’ as the family name for both Archie and Lilibet which the couple hopes will ‘unify’ the family, says The Times.
Whistler is a popular ski destination for many big names looking for picturesque pistes, chic chalets and steady snowfall. In fact one of the most iconic pictures of King Charles III – then Prince Charles – and his sons was snapped on the Whistler slopes. Pictured in 1998, the three royal boys enjoyed a fun day out in the snow, all smiles and fully clad in classic 90s ski-gear. The holiday was the first ski trip the family took following the tragic death of Diana in 1997. Diana – reportedly a real snow bunny herself – loved taking her sons out on the slopes, so the Whistler trip without her was a significant moment in the boys’ life.

The royals aren’t the only frosty frequenters, with Hollywood stars like Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher loving the Canada coldspot. The Beckham clan have also been known to while away the days in Whistler, enjoying regular family holidays with their kids Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper.

This Valentine's Day saw Prince Harry fearlessly delve into the world of adaptive sit-skiing, a challenging alpine sport. The Duchess, bundled up against the frosty weather, cheered on her husband from the sidelines. After successfully completing a short run, Prince Harry described the experience as ‘bizarre’ but labeled it a great challenge, according to The Telegraph. The couple spent over half an hour at the outdoor camp, interacting with competitors from 19 nations, engaging with veterans and witnessing demonstrations of various winter sports disciplines, including Nordic skiing and skeleton, which will debut in the upcoming Games.
Braving the -4 degrees Celsius temperature, the Duke and Duchess clasped hands. Meghan is no stranger to colder climates, however, having spent much of her career living in Toronto whilst filming the hit TV show Suits. The couple's connection to Canada runs deep, with the country playing a significant role in their personal history. Their first public appearance as a couple was at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto, and Vancouver Island served as their initial sanctuary before relocating to the US amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Harry took to the day like a fish in water; he’s no stranger to adaptive sports, having engaged in a wheelchair rugby match in the inaugural Invictus Games in London with his cousin Zara Tindall and her husband (ex professional rugby player) Mike Tindall. His dedication to the Games, founded a decade ago, remains a prominent aspect of his philanthropy and personal causes.
The visit comes on the heels of a particularly busy week for Meghan and Harry. Prince Harry rushed to London to visit his father, King Charles, following his cancer diagnosis. Following this he touched down in Vegas for an NFL Honors award ceremony. Then came the much discussed launch of the Sussexes' rebranded official website, featuring newly written biographies that underscore their philanthropic endeavours. Prince Harry is described as a ‘humanitarian, military veteran, mental health advocate, and environmental campaigner,’ while Meghan is hailed as a ‘feminist champion of human rights and gender equality.’ The website has attracted a lot of attention, largely for its use of the royal family crest, despite what critics called ‘Megxit’ – the departure of Harry and Meghan from royal duties in 2020.

The 2025 Invictus Games hold special significance, with Scott Moore named CEO of the Vancouver Whistler 2025 event. His vision for the Games includes leaving a lasting legacy for veterans through adaptive sports, potentially paving the way for future winter editions. Speculation arises about a potential TV deal, given Moore's track record in securing lucrative broadcasting deals and the presence of broadcasting crews capturing the royal couple's involvement. Prince Harry, a veteran of the British Army, is expected to reflect on Canada's importance to him and Meghan during a speech on Friday at the final countdown event in Vancouver.
