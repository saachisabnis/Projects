Is it a done deal? A week before his baby was born, sources close to Justin Bieber revealed how he really feels about Selena Gomez and her relationship with his friend Benny Blanco. 
A source dished to In Touch Weekly that the “Baby” singer is “pretty offended by the fact that Benny totally cut him out of his life when he got together with Selena.” They added, “They used to be great friends, so it came as a huge shock, especially since Justin would love nothing more than to put all the bad blood with Selena behind him.”

Benny and Selena became public in December 2023 after the “Single Soon” singer replied to an Instagram comment asking if she’s in a relationship. Since then, the two have posted cute pictures of themselves as a couple including one that was posted hours after Hailey Bieber announced she was pregnant. But the source claims that Justin “finds it so annoying that they always seem to be taking these passive-aggressive shots at him on social media.”

The source notes that Selena and Benny are leaning into the engagement rumors and Justin “can’t believe that it’s still carrying on and that Benny is playing into it. He would have expected a lot more from him.” They continued, “He’s sure that if he was pulling stunts and going online attention seeking, he’d get slammed for it, but somehow Selena and Benny seem to get away with it and never get called out.”
Drama rumors with Selena and the Biebers have been around since the Only Murders in the Building star and Justice artist broke up and the latter married Hailey. Though the three have settled their differences and advocated for each other on social media, the source claims that Justin is trying to shut the door permanently. “[Justin has] tried so many times to make peace with them and get past the BS, but they just won’t let it go, and he’s now saying good riddance,” says the source. “He thinks they’re lame and immature, and he’s not going to bother trying to be friendly anymore.”
Hailey and Justin welcomed their son Jack Blues and shared the news on August 23, 2024 with Justin posting a heartwarming close-up of their newborn’s tiny foot on Instagram. Meanwhile, things are also getting pretty serious with Selena and Benny. During an appearance on SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show in May 2024, Howard Stern asked Benny: “You want to have kids with Selena? Have you told her you want to have kids yet?” to which the producer replied: “It’s always a topic of conversation to me every day. That’s my next goal, to check the box. I have a ton of godkids; I’ve got a ton of nephews. I love being around kids.”
