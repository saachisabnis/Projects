The couple announced Hailey’s pregnancy in May after renewing their vows in Hawaii. 
Hailey wore a Saint Laurent white lace gown that showed off her growing baby bump and a matching veil while Justin wore a teddybear coat and a baseball cap. 
Justin commemorated their vow renewal by gifting Hailey an upgraded diamond engagement ring estimated to be worth $1.5 million. 
The model, who married the Grammy-winning artist in 2018, moved her original $400,000 engagement ring to her right pinky finger. 
Following news of their incoming bundle of joy, fans are convinced the Rhode Skin founder hinted she was expecting a baby girl after sharing a photo of her nails painted pink with cherry blossoms. 
However, the pair have yet to comment on the speculation.
Hailey has documented her pregnancy journey by sharing photos of her bump on social media. She also shared with fans earlier this month that she was experiencing lower back pain during her pregnancy.
