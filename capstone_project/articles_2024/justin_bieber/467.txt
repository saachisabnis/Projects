 No bad blood here. Hailey Bieber showed some subtle support for Selena Gomez's big engagement news today.

 The "Calm Down" singer announced that her boyfriend of one year, Benny Blanco, popped the question with an Instagram post last night. She wrote "forever begins now..." under a carousel of images. For the cover slide, she included a snap of her glossy manicured hand with her huge 8-carat diamond ring. The slideshow also included a smiley photo of Gomez sitting cross-legged on a picnic blanket, another of the music producer holding her in his arms and kissing her head, and a selfie in which the singer-actress-producer smilers wide while showing off her left hand.

 The Rhode founder's show of love came via a "like" on the post.

 Gomez and Bieber have been in and out of feud rumors over the years, as people have claimed the model "stole" Justin Bieber from Gomez. Gomez and Justin had an on-again, off-again relationship; they started dating in late 2010 and split in 2016. They got back together in October 2017, though their rekindling was short-lived, as they split shortly after. Justin and Hailey tied the knot during a civil ceremony on New York in September 2018, and later celebrated with a larger wedding ceremony in South Carolina in September 2019. Most recently, the two welcomed their first child, a son named Jack Blues, on August 23, 2024.

 In September 2022, Bieber addressed tension rumors while appearing on Alex Cooper's podcast, "Call Her Daddy." She told the host it is "not [her] character to mess with someone's relationship" and it's "all love" between her and Gomez.

 "I can say, period, point blank, I was never with [Justin] when he was in a relationship with anybody—that's the end of it," she added.

 Weeks after the interview, the two women broke the internet by taking photos together at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures' 2nd annual gala in Los Angeles. In the images, the pair strike fierce poses, with Gomez pressing her face against Bieber's and even holding her leg.

 Bieber was just one of many A-listers to wish Gomez well. Taylor Swift jokingly commented, "yes I will be the flower girl," while Cardi B quipped, "Waiiiitttt hold on 😱😱😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️" and Jennifer Aniston wrote, "HONEY!! Congratulations sweet mama! ❤️💫"

 The love fest continued with Lily Collins writing, "Ahhhhhhhh yes yes yes!! Best news ever. Couldn’t be more happy for you both ❤️❤️❤️❤️" and Nina Dobrev saying, "YES !!!! Congratulations!!!!! So happy for you both!!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍‼️"

 Arguably the best comment was from Blanco himself, now Gomez's fiancé, who wrote, "hey wait… that’s my wife."
