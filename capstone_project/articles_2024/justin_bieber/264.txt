Celebrity fashion stylist Dani Michelle dropped the photo below of pregnant supermodel Hailey Baldwin Bieber strutting down a New York City street in a stunning silky cape mini dress (and shoes) by designer Phoebe Philo. 
Michelle captioned the photo of Ms. Bieber — rocking a pair of black YSL sunglasses, Tiffany & Co. jewelry, and a black Ferragamo purse — “HAILEY BIEBER x baby x nyc.”

Hailey’s fans are going wild over her power mama look. As one replied: “Baby & momma serving.” Another chimed in, “She looks like an angel.” 
Note: Of course that’s her husband, pop star Justin Bieber, in tow. He’s sporting a California Angels baseball cap, sunglasses, a puffy denim vest, black satiny capris and white socks with black smiley face slippers. 
None of the fans have yet commented on his ensemble, but based on a past interview between Hailey and James Corden (below), she likely approves of the Biebs’s look. As Corden joked, “Love is blind.”
Note: Hailey is also busy promoting her new skin care line Rhode. In the photos below, she’s wearing her “blush in piggy,” which promises to hydrate skin for “baby-soft cheeks and leaves a glowy finish without a greasy feel.”
