Being a star is never smooth sailing and, for many celebrities, their relationships aren’t either. That means, over the years, we’ve seen many celebrity couples break up and get back together. While some reconciled stars managed to come back stronger than ever, others eventually split again — and, in some cases, again and again and again.
Many of the most famously hot-and-heavy couples of all time have broken up at one point or another, only to be drawn back into each other’s orbits — think Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, or Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick. We’re taking a look back at some of the other most thrilling re-couplings of exes we’ve seen over the years…some of whom we still hope might be on their way to a happy ending.
While Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez certainly win the prize as the couple who went the longest broken up before reuniting, we can’t help but wonder what other long-lost loves might one day be added to this list. As you read and remember, let these celebrity reunions, both real and imagined, act as your proof that no time spent in love was ever wasted: five, ten, or 17 years down the road, you may pick up just where you left off.
A version of this article was previously published in June 2021.
Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo were introduced by a mutual friend in 2012 but ran into trouble a year later when they suddenly called off their romance. 
However, a month later they were not only back together, but also engaged. The couple got married in 2014 and now have three kids. Though they did face a cheating scandal in 2022, they are still going strong. 
Nick and Vanessa Lachey seemed to be going strong until their surprise breakup in June 2009 after three years of dating. By October of the same year, the couple had reconciled and wasted no time in moving their relationship forward.
The duo got engaged in 2010 and tied the knot a year later before welcoming three kids. 
Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade first took their relationship public in 2010 and took a break in 2013, citing busy work schedules as the reason they were taking a step back. During that time, Wade fathered a child with Aja Metoyer, but still reunited with Union by the end of 2013, proposing to her in 2015. They’ve been together ever since. 
Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny are back on after the unexpected pairing initially split in December 2023 after nearly a year of dating. Then, on May 30, People reported they’d gotten back together. 
“It’s going well and they’re prioritizing spending time together as they figure it out,” a source told the outlet. “There wasn’t ever any drama in their breakup and they missed each other.”
“It’s like they needed the break to miss each other enough to figure things out,” the insider explained. They always had this crazy attraction to each other. Things are great again.”
Country star Sam Hunt and his wife Hannah Lee Fowler were all smiles at the 2024 CMT Music Awards. Their appearance was their first following their brief split in February 2022.
At the time, Fowler filed for divorce and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason to terminate the marriage, per Entertainment Tonight. The documents, which also revealed she was pregnant with their first child, accused Hunt of “inappropriate marital conduct,” and claimed that he was “guilty of adultery.” 
Two months later, in April, the two called off the divorce. “Sam and Hannah are working on healing their relationship,” a source told the outlet at the time. “They’re very excited to be welcoming their baby girl together and focused on that. Sam has been putting the work in and making sure that Hannah feels comfortable, safe and trusts him.”
Since then, the two have welcomed two kids and have appeared to have gotten back on track. 
“There were years there where, you know, maybe I didn’t realize how much growing up I had needed to do,” Hunt told ET Canada about his budding family. “And having a child forces you to do that. It shifts something in your nervous system. There’s a skin that I needed to shed, and I did that when I had my child.” 
Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck truly played the long game with their relationship, first breaking off their engagement the day before their wedding in 2003 and then not getting back together until 2021, when Lopez called off her engagement to Alex Rodriguez. They got engaged once again and had the most fairytale-like wedding ever.
Between 2003 and 2013, singers Ashanti and Nelly has a rocky on-and-off relationship. Recently, however, news broke that the two were officially back together. “Nelly and Ashanti are back together and both of them are very happy,” a source told Entertainment Tonight. “Nelly and Ashanti are really enjoying their time together.”
Kate Middleton and Prince William have been through so much together since they first met in 2002, including one famous brief breakup in 2007, reportedly precipitated by a moment of cold feet about the commitment ahead from William. Kate played it cool and William won her back within the year, but it definitely wasn’t smooth sailing throughout.
Justin and Hailey Bieber met back in 2009 during a fan event but didn’t grow closer until 2014 when they started going to church together. They were known as best friends over the years, getting together in Feb. 2016. However, they broke it off sometime in 2016, not talking again until 2018.
Within a couple of months, the pair got engaged and wed in a courthouse ceremony later that year. They had another ceremony in Sept. 2019 and have been happily together since. 
In August, married couple Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin left everyone in shock after announcing they were getting a divorce. “I love my family,” Flavin, who filed the divorce, told People at the time. “We are amicably and privately addressing these personal issues.”
Fast-forward one month later, however, the two got back together. “They decided to meet back up at home, where they talked and were able to work out their differences. They are both extremely happy,” the actor’s rep told Page Six.
Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s relationship may be one of the messiest public breakups we’ve ever seen. They’ve dated on and off again from 2016 to 2021, welcoming their daughter True in April 2018. They first broke up in 2019 after he allegedly kissed the Kardashian’s friend Jordyn Woods.
They got back together in early 2020, but they separated for good in 2021, with word breaking out soon after that Thompson had cheated on Kardashian with a woman named Maralee Nichols. And yes, Kardashian and him were also expecting a baby via surrogate at the time. What a whirlwind!

In December 2014 they welcomed their third child Reign but Disick’s partying was out of control by 2015, when he checked briefly into rehab and split with Kourtney once again after stepping out with stylist Chloe Bartoli.

Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber’s romance was on-and-off for quite a few years, so even though they aren’t together anymore, we felt they were a strong addition to this round-up.
