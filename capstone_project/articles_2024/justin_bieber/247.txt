DJ Khaled has reached a major career milestone — and he has the plaque to prove it.
On Thursday (December 5) Khaled posted to Instagram that his 2017 single “I’m the One” with Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance The Rapper and Lil Wayne had been certified Diamond by the RIAA, for sales of 10 million units. This is Khaled’s first-ever Diamond plaque.

“ALERT ! @wethebest IM THE ONE OFFICIALLY CERTIFIED DIAMOND. GOD IS THE GREATEST! Bless up,” he wrote, while sharing video of a ceremony announcing the certification to a crowd.

“I’m the One” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart upon its release.
The track marked the first #1 for Lil Chano and Quavo as a soloist, while Bieber earned his fourth and Weezy his third. The song snatched the crown from Bruno Mars, whose “That’s What I Like” single enjoyed a week at the top.
