Hailey Bieber is a proud mom and is adding even more personal touches to her style that pay tribute to her and Justin Bieber's son Jack Blues, including a new golden accessory honoring the newborn.
The 27-year-old model and new mom shared a video to her TikTok this week promoting her Rhode Skin brand, but many fans couldn't help but notice a new subtle yet sweet tribute to her nearly 2-month-old son. Among the golden and watches adorning her wrist in the video is a gold bangle with "Jack Blues" engraved along it in a gothic print, per Page Six. The outlet notes that the accessory is the 1881 bangle from the brand HIE Hawaii and that it symbolizes "perfection, light and life."
The bangle wasn't the only accessory dedicated to her little one seen in the video, either. Bieber, who has previously shown off a diamond-encrusted "MOM" ring, also wore the bedazzled "JBB" bubble necklace she debuted earlier this month while reflecting on being "someone's mom" that matches the "B" believed to signify her marriage to the "Peaches" singer.
The Biebers became parents in August with the birth of the first child together. The 30-year-old musician made the sweet announcement on Instagram alongside a photo of his wife and child and telling his son "Welcome Home."
