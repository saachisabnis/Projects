Cardi has been in the hospital since at least Monday evening (Oct. 21), when she livestreamed on Instagram from her hospital bed.
According to Vulture, the rapper went live after someone allegedly prank-called CPS on the mom of three, claiming Cardi's children were being physically abused at home.
"Motherf---ers have taken s--t too f---ing far when you mess with my f---ing kids,” she said on the Instagram Live, revealing the prank resulted in CPS showing up at her house at 11PM while her young children were asleep.
During the livestream, Cardi vowed to hire a private investigator to discover the identity of the prank caller.
Cardi is mom to Kulture Kiari Cephus, 6, son Wave Set Cephus, 3, and a newborn daughter with ex Offset, from whom she split over the summer.
