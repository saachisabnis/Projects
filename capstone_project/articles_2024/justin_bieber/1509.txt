Selena Gomez and her boyfriend, Benny Blanco, announced their engagement after more than one year of dating.
“Forever begins now,” Gomez, 32, captioned an Instagram post on Wednesday, December 11, that showed off her engagement ring. Blanco, 36, celebrated the milestone moment, writing in the comments section, “Hey wait… that’s my wife.”
The couple collaborated together on a handful of songs — including her 2015 hit “Same Old Love” — before becoming romantically involved in 2023. After sparking dating rumors with Blanco, Gomez confirmed their relationship in December 2023, revealing that they had been together for “six months.”
“He is my absolute everything in my heart,” she wrote in an Instagram comment at the time. “He [has] been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. The end. … He’s still better than anyone I’ve been with. Facts.”
The following month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Gomez had “never been with anyone like” Blanco.
“She loves how Benny treats her: he’s so kind and thoughtful,” the insider said in January. “It’s been a very long time since friends saw Selena this happy. She’s positively glowing.”

In February, Gomez offered a rare insight into her dynamic with Blanco. “Without getting into too much detail, I think it’s just really important to meet someone that respects you,” she explained in an interview with Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe. “And I think it’s really nice to also lean on someone who understands the world that I live in.”
She added: “But I’d have to say, overall, it’s the safest that I feel and it’s been really lovely and I’ve only grown through it, so it’s awesome.”
As for Blanco, he expressed his enthusiasm over his romance with Gomez in May. “I wake up every day and I look in the mirror, and I’m like, ‘How did this happen?’” he quipped on Today With Hoda and Jenna at the time. “But until anyone figures it out, weeeee!”
Later that month, sources divulged how serious Gomez and Blanco had become.
“He makes Selena laugh,” one insider told Us in May. “He makes her feel secure and happy. They both think they’ve found the person they’ll be with forever.”

A second source, meanwhile, emphasized that Gomez and Blanco were in it for the long haul. “She definitely sees this relationship going the distance,” the insider noted. “They’ve talked about marriage and having children and are very much on the same page.”
“Selena has found the love of her life,” the second source added. “She’s ready to settle down.”
Prior to her engagement to Blanco, Gomez dated Justin Bieber on and off from 2010 to 2018 and The Weeknd in 2017.
