Kendall Jenner received a citation for failing to stop.
The 28-year-old model was running errands in Beverly Hills with her friend Hailey Bieber when police pulled her over and issued her a ticket after she ran through a stop sign on Tuesday (Jan. 9).
Photographs obtained by TMZ showed the stars took the incident in their stride as they were seen laughing and smiling with the cop who had stopped the Mercedes-Benz G500 Cabriolet.
Failing to stop at a stop sign can include penalties of a small fine or a point on a driver's record, potentially leading to increased insurance premiums.
Kendall and Hailey have been spending a lot of time together recently, as they were among a group of friends who celebrated the new year in Barbados, along with the latter's husband, singer Justin Bieber, and the Kardashians star's former boyfriend Bad Bunny.
But despite the group vacation, insiders have told TMZ Kendall and Bad Bunny are not back together, though they have remained close.
In a clip of New Year's Eve fireworks posted by Kendall's friend, the "Monaco" hit-maker could be heard in the background wishing everyone "feliz ano nuevo."
It was revealed last month that the former couple, who had last been seen together at the Saturday Night Live after party in October following the 29-year-old musician's appearance on the show, had gone their separate ways.
A source told Entertainment Tonight: "Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.
"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go.
"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down."
