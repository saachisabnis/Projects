A man named Doogie Lish Sandtiger holds the title for having the world’s largest collection of Crocs.
The Connecticut-based social worker shared the thousands of pairs he has amassed in a segment on NBC’s “Today” show. Speaking with reporter Kathy Park, he revealed that growing up in the foster care system and not learning how to tie his shoes led to his enthusiasm for Crocs. Bullies would make fun of Sandtiger for wearing velcro shoes before he started collecting the iconic rubber clogs in high school. 
Speaking about his love for the brand, he told Park, “One of their mottos is, ‘Come as you are’ and I love that. Be authentic. Be yourself.”

Entering the footwear space two decades ago, the comfort shoe company has sold over 125 million pairs in the past year alone and has collaborated with high fashion brands like Balenciaga, as well as artists such as Justin Bieber and Post Malone. 
Sandtiger owns close to 4,000 pairs (3,577 to be exact), including some exclusive styles. The most expensive pair he owns is Crocs’ collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. He picked up the colorful clogs for $3,600. He also owns the Balenciaga x Crocs rain boots and platform clogs.
Throughout the interview, he wears the cartoonish Crocs x MSCHF boots. The collaboration saw the Brooklyn design studios’ viral Big Red Boot given a Crocs makeover with a bright yellow colorway and the brand’s signature design details. 
“On a given day, sometimes I’ll wear like 5-6 pairs of different Crocs,” Sandtiger told Park, who borrowed a pair of platform clogs featuring nostalgic Lisa Frank artwork. He also showed off an outrageous collaboration with Kentucky Fried Chicken, which came with fried chicken Jibbitz charms that smelled like chicken.

Santiger’s impressive (and growing) collection has earned him the nickname “Croc King” online. “The goal is to keep collecting and eventually submit to Guinness and get that world record total.” You can follow him on Instagram, where he has over 20,000 followers.
