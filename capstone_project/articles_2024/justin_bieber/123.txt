Tate McRae is set to headline the 2024 NHL All-Star Game. She’ll perform during the second intermission at the event on February 3rd at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto. McRae was previously announced as one of the celebrity captains, along with Justin Bieber and Michael Bublé. “My brother is a hockey player, and having grown up in Calgary, hockey has always been a part of my life,” she told Uproxx in a new interview. “In creating the Think Later era, hockey just became a great way to pay homage to my roots and highlight the athleticism in my fashion, style, and approach to live performances.” More performers will be announced in the coming days. The Toronto Maple Leafs will host the NHL All-Star Weekend February 1st to 3rd in Toronto. The All-Star Game will air on ABC and ESPN+.
