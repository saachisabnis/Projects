Hailey Bieber took her birthday outfit seriously.
Bieber, who turned 28 on Friday, November 22, took to Instagram on Sunday, November 24, to show off her party-girl outfit. Her ensemble consisted of a vintage 1999 Gucci by Tom Ford coat featuring a deep fur-lined neckline and long suede sleeves. The piece was finished with a thin belt that cinched at her waist and a short skirt equipped with more fur.
The Rhode founder, who welcomed her first baby with husband Justin Bieber in August, elevated her look with YSL slingback heels ($1,050) and sheer Calzedonia tights. For a glamorous good measure, Hailey sparkled with layered Victoria Diamond Vine necklaces from Tiffany & Co. and multiple diamond earrings.
As for her makeup, Hailey maintained her winter-chic look with glowy makeup, thanks to her dewy skin care routine using Rhode products. She used a mix of her Pocket Blushes in the shades Freckle and Toasted and tied her glam together with filled-in eyebrows, brown winged eyeliner, black mascara and glossy lips. Her brown hair was parted down the middle and styled in a half-up twisted coif.
