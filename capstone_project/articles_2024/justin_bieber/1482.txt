Usher put on a fantastic performance during the Super Bowl halftime show, and he had a collective group of special guests that made it more special such as Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, will.i.am, H.E.R., Lil Jon, and Ludacris.
Many people were anticipating seeing Justin Bieber on stage. In an interview with TMZ, Lil Jon shared that Bieber wasn’t ready to perform.
“We wanted to put Justin in the show, so we had the idea of doing a version of the show with Justin in it,” Lil Jon said. “But I think Justin just wasn’t really ready.”
Usher interviewed with “The Breakfast Club” on Feb. 16, revealing why things didn’t work out with Bieber.
“They did work out with Justin. I honored and recognized my brother,” Usher said. “I think that it might’ve been the fact that he’s just wanting to tell a different story right now and I understand. But we did have a brief conversation. We’re going to do something else in the future, but no love lost or anything like that. I think that it’s a lot of pressure for the Super Bowl, obviously, for me to put together a show so I reached out to everybody. Justin wasn’t the only person that I actually spoke to about doing the Super Bowl. But the moment was maybe for later.”
Usher then made a claim that Bieber would be a part of a future performance.
“He’s going to play the Super Bowl. I’ll go ahead and give you that, in the future,” Usher said. “I profess that over his life because he has a career that deserves it. It just didn’t happen but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to.”
Charlamagne Tha God then asked Usher who else he reached out to for the halftime performance.
“I can’t give you all of that, Charlamagne. I wish I could, but I can’t give you that exclusive,” Usher said. “…I reached out to some hitters. I was curating what would be one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time, and it actually turned into that because of who I reached out to.”
