“Welcome home,” the pop star wrote in all-caps
Justin Bieber has shared the arrival of his newborn baby Jack Blues with wife Hailey Bieber.
Earlier today (August 24), Bieber posted a close-up picture of Jack Blues being embraced by Hailey. “Welcome home,” the pop star writes in all-caps. This follows up a post by Bieber earlier this month showing the couple out and about, with Hailey proudly sporting a baby bump.

Bieber has largely kept away from the live music stage this year, aside from a surprise appearance during Tems’ Coachella set, along with a one-off show in Mumbai, India, for which he was reportedly paid US$10million to perform.
The show went down at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai, and included Bieber running through a number of his biggest songs, including ‘Baby’, ‘Sorry’ and ‘What Do You Mean?’
In 2022, he also took a formal break from performing live, cancelling all of the remaining live shows on his ‘Justice’ tour after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome and suffering partial facial paralysis.
He reportedly turned down the offer to join Usher during his Super Bowl performance this year, as he “wasn’t feeling it”. A source claimed to Page Six that “there’s no bad blood between Usher and Justin,” adding, “Justin just wasn’t up for it.”
He also played a private show in February at a private NHL All-Star party, ahead of the All-Star Game, for which he served as a team captain, alongside Michael Bublé, Tate McRae and Will Arnett.
In April, Bieber led the tributes to his close friend and rapper Chris King, who was reportedly shot dead aged 32.
