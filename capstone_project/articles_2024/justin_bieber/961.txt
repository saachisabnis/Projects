Kehlani has not taken her foot off the gas all year, and after dropping a new album just a few months ago, she’s now gearing up to drop a mixtape.
Taking to Instagram on Wednesday (August 21), the Oakland native revealed While We Wait 2 – the sequel to 2019’s While We Wait – will be dropping on August 28.

She also shared the cover art, which features a very mindful, very demure Lani amid a backdrop that shares the same pattern as the original tape.
Check out the cover below.
Kehlani first hinted at the tape last month by posting a photo of a journal to her Instagram Story with “While We Wait 2” written on the page.
Just two months ago in June, the singer’s released her fourth studio album, Crash. It follows 2022’s Blue Water Road, which featured appearances from Blxst, Justin Bieber, Syd, Jessie Reyez, Ambré and Thundercat. The album debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, earning 22,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.

Before that, Kehlani hinted at doing a collaborative album with Russ.
In footage shared by HipHop-N-More in 2021, the two were spotted at a club making plans for a possible LP.

“I just told Russ I would make an album with him in the club,” Lani said in the clip. “Listen, hold her accountable, because I doubt it,” Russ responded.
After HHNM shared the clip, it surfaced on X (formerly known as Twitter). Russ responded to the tweet in a since-deleted post writing, “Russ x Kehlani project” followed by pair of eyes emojis.

And while nothing came of it, it wasn’t the first time a project from the pair was floated around.
Back in 2020, Russ had already pondered a potential joint effort with Kehlani but his vision featured more players than her. After releasing his CHOMP EP in November 2020, he spoke with Ebro Darden on Beats 1 and detailed why an R&B follow-up would be the right move after strictly rapping on CHOMP.

“I might have to come with five songs and it’s me and Keyshia Cole, and Kehlani, and Ari Lennox, and there’s not an ounce of rap on it,” Russ told Ebro. “And you put that right next to CHOMP and it’s like, enjoy.”
