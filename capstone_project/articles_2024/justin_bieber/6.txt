Justin and Hailey Bieber proved once again that they are couple goals in a new Instagram photo series celebrating their love and the upcoming birth of their first child. 
The "Sorry" standout took to social media to share a carousel of snaps featuring precious moments with his bride, as she stunned in a form-fitting red dress that perfectly accentuated her growing baby bump. The first photo in the series shows Justin looking down at his future child in awe as Hailey sports a soft smile. As the cute series continues, followers are introduced to the pair locking lips in front of a light as bright as their future with baby Bieber. 
This is not the first heartwarming social post that Justin has made in tribute to his beautiful wife and unborn child. Just last week, the "Intentions" standout shared a sweet clip with all eyes on Hailey as he placed his hands on her stomach looking lost in love and pure bliss.
The pair announced their pregnancy in May following an intimate vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii. Hailey shared video footage from the special occasion to Instagram that depicted the lovebirds partaking in a countryside photoshoot, debuting the Rhode Skin founder's baby bump. 
A due date has yet to be announced as Justin, Hailey, and the rest of the world ready for the arrival of baby Bieber.
