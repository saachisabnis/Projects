I’m a Real Estate Agent: 6 Places I’d Retire If I Had $500,000More: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000
As of Nov. 30, 2023, the typical home value in the Golden State was $746,055, compared to a national value of $346,048. It’s remarkable to recognize that the value of California is more than double the price of the country as a whole.
Still, the state has a disparity in price from city to city. Which California areas have the priciest typical home value? GOBankingRates found the 20 most expensive home markets in California, according to Zillow’s November 2023 data. Leading the list of 20 are Atherton ($7.3 million typical home value), Beverly Hills ($5.5 million), Los Altos Hills ($5.1 million), Montecito ($5.1 million) and Hillsborough ($5 million).
While we’re California dreamin’, let’s go all out and see what $5 million can buy in the state. GOBankingRates identified some homes currently for sale in the $4.5 million to $5 million range, and here’s a sampling to give you a look at the amenities and luxuries that come with a mega-priced property.
