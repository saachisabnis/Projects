 Hailey and Justin Bieber — power couple and king and queen of dressing for two different occasions — are stronger and happier than ever, thank you very much. The husband-and-wife duo aren't giving any light to the haters or online divorce speculation and are actually “doing really well,” according to People.

 “There’s no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever,” a source told the outlet about the couple who wed in 2018. “They are very, very happy.”

 Last month, the Rhode skincare founder took to her Instagram Story to shut down any of the rumors circulating about her marriage to Justin. “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong Made out of thin air… Come from the land of delusion…” she wrote. “So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it.”

 Fans started theorizing about the couple's status earlier this year after Hailey's father, Stephen Baldwin, reshared a video of Justin singing and asked for followers to pray for them, writing, "Christians, please when you think of Justin and Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord."

 Baldwin's request ignited concern for their relationship, but Hailey debunked the idea of any marital trouble with a sweet birthday tribute to Justin, in which she called him the "love of my life."

 "30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!!🥹😭 that was fast," she wrote alongside a black-and-white clip of the two kissing, in addition to other images. "words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍."
