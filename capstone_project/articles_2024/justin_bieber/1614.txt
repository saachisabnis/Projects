 Hailey Bieber is getting back to business-chic. 

 On Saturday, Dec. 7, the model and Rhode founder, 28, was photographed heading for a girls’ night out in Los Angeles in a red velvet blazer, matching mini skirt, sheer black Calzedonia tights and a pair of heeled black pumps. 

 Hailey was joined by her close friend Kylie Jenner for the dinner outing at Wally’s Beverly Hills. She had earlier supported pal Gigi Hadid at her Guest in Residence store opening in Beverly Hills, the brand's second store in the U.S.

 The new mom accessorized her look with a pair of black sunglasses and a black handbag, while her hair was worn in a half-up half-down style.

 Hailey’s dinner date with Jenner, 27, comes after she showed off another matching blazer and mini skirt look in an Instagram post on Thursday, Dec. 5, which featured several glam shots and the caption, "business as usual."

 In the first photo from the carousel, Hailey snapped a mirror selfie in a chocolate brown blazer and matching brown mini skirt.

 She also shared a full-length shot of the look on her Instagram Stories revealing her brown ballet flats with the caption, “Office.”

 Hailey accessorized with a pair of dark sunglasses and her staple blingy "B" necklace, a likely tribute to her and husband Justin Bieber’s shared last name.

 Hailey and Justin, 30, announced the arrival of their first child together in August, with Justin sharing the news in a sweet Instagram post.

 "WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER," the singer wrote alongside a black-and-white photo of their baby boy’s tiny foot. Hailey also re-shared the photo on her Instagram Stories with the baby's name alongside a teddy bear and blue heart emoji.

 Last month, Hailey revealed a glimpse into the couple’s life with son Jack Blues in a wholesome carousel post on Instagram.

 The first photo showed the proud parents seemingly holding their bundled-up son as they went for an autumn walk and flashed huge smiles at the camera.

 "November aka the best month of the year 🫶🏼🍁," she captioned the post, with also featured photos of the couple's pet pooch and a cozy fireplace.
