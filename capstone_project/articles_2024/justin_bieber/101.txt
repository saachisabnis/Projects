Snoop Dogg‘s daughter said she was “scared” when she suffered a stroke.
Cori Broadus, who suffers from autoimmune condition lupus, was hospitalized in January this year after suffering a health scare and she’s recalled questioning why her health was in such “decline” while busy planning her wedding to Wayne Deuce.
“My health was declining. Doctor comes in, ‘Cori, you had a stroke,’ ” she reflected in a clip from upcoming three-part E! series ‘Snoop Dogg’s Fatherhood: Cori and Wayne’s Story.”
Broadus continued, “I’m hurting, I’m scared. Why is this happening to me?”
The trailer also showed the 25-year-old bride-to-be and her partner stressed from trying to plan a wedding for 750 guests, with Broadus’ desire for $10,000 shoes, a helicopter and a performance from Justin Bieber leading to conflict.
“I’m a princess, so the princess gotta do it big.” she noted.
“Me and Wayne are in some deep trouble.” she later said in the trailer.
“There’s no point in talking. Should I even get married?” Deuce ominously adds during a clip from a couple’s therapy session.
Broadus was hospitalized for a week after suffering a stroke at “The Underdoggs” premiere, and kept her followers regularly updated.
Alongside a photo of herself in her hospital bed, Broadus wrote on Instagram at the time: “I had a severe stroke this am. I started breaking down crying when they told me.”
Days later, she announced on her Instagram stories, “God is working overtime you hear me! My kidneys were doing terrible … doctors came in this AM and said they are improving so much.”
And then she was relieved to learn a CT scan of her chest had come back “normal” so she would be allowed to leave the hospital.
“I can prolly cry,” she wrote on her Instagram story. “Omgggg thank you thank you for the continuous prayers, love etc.”
