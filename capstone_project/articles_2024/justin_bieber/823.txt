Lemon-lime, it's your time to shine.  
One thing about me? I'm a Sprite girlie through and through. I love pretty much all soda (much to my dentist's dismay), but there's something about a crispy Sprite straight outta the fountain that just gets me going in the best possible way. I mean, let's be honest: it's one of the most versatile drink options out there. It's not too sweet, it's citrusy without making your mouth pucker, and it brings me right back to my childhood somehow. I'm obsessed. 
Another great thing about Sprite (or, you know, any other lemon-lime soda)? It's a wonderful mixer if you're whipping up a boozy beverageâ€”and not just because you can find it pretty much anywhere. (The grocery store! The hot dog cart outside your office! Your parents' fridge!) The fruity flavor and fizzy feel complement pretty much every other liquid, so you can pair it with damn near anything without having to worry about overpowering the other flavors in your concoction. 
All that to say...long live the Sprite cocktail! To get you started on your lemon-limey journey, I compiled some of the best, most creative cocktails (and mocktails!) that utilize the zesty beverage, and popped 'em right here believe. Scroll down to find one that tickles your fancy (I'm partial to the Virgin Strawberry Lime Mojito, if you even care), and dig that cocktail-making kit out from the back of your bar cart. It's time to get bubbly. 
Grab your favorite highball glass (a skinny tall glass works well, too) and fill it with ice cubes. Next, pour in a splash of grenadine, add a shot of vodka, then top with lemon-lime soda. Garnish with cherries, lime wedges, or your favorite fruit.
