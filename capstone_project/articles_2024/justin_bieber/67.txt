Justin Bieber has reportedly found his “Purpose” as a father.
Days after the singer and wife Hailey Bieber confirmed the arrival of their baby boy, Jack Blues, People reported that the pop star is “already a great dad” to the newborn.
“[Justin and Hailey are] both overjoyed,” a source told the outlet Sunday. 
“The baby is such a miracle. He’s adorable and doing well. Hailey’s doing well, too.”
The insider added that the couple — who tied the knot in September 2018 — had been “praying” to be able to start their family.
“The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for,” the source said. 
“The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant was the best ever for Justin. He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them.”
The Grammy winner, 30, shared the news of his son’s birth with the world on Friday.
“WELCOME HOME … JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻,” Justin captioned a photo of the little one’s foot, which Hailey appeared to be cradling.
The baby’s moniker has a sentimental meaning since Jack is the middle name of Justin’s father, Jeremy Bieber.
The “Sorry” hitmaker’s mom, Pattie Mallette, celebrated her grandson’s debut on X Friday night, posting, “CONGRATULATIONS @justinbieber & Hailey. I LOVE YOU FOREVER BABY JACK!!”
The Rhode Skin founder’s father, Stephen Baldwin, retweeted Mallette and wrote, “Amen, Congratulations to you and may God continue to bless our family.”
The actor’s reaction on social media came months after Hailey, 27, revealed she was not “super close” to her famous relatives anymore.
“I’m not super close with my family at this point in my life because I feel like I’m very independent. I’m my own individual now, and I’ve built my own family,” the model told W magazine in July.
Hailey revealed her pregnancy in May while sharing photos from her and Justin’s romantic vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii.
The beauty entrepreneur, who was six months along at the time, showed off her baby bump in a white lace Saint Laurent dress, which she paired with a matching veil.
“I was honestly able to keep it quiet because I stayed small for a long time,” she later explained in her W magazine cover story. “I didn’t have a belly, really, until I was six months pregnant, which was when I announced it.”
