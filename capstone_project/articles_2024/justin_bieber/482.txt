This month, a candlelight concert will be held at Coventry Cathedral to mark the festive season. The concert is set to be a 'multi-sensory' musical experience, with popular Christmas hits sung under the candlelight.
The concert will include classic carols such as "Silent Night," "We Wish You a Merry Christmas," and "Jingle Bells," along with soundtracks from the traditional film The Nutcracker. String quartet The Sekine Quartet will be performing, and the space will be decorated with festive decorations and thousands of candles to create a 'magical' atmosphere for visitors.
The concert will take place on Friday, December 20, at 8:30 p.m. People of all ages are welcome, whether you have attended a classical musical concert or not. Thousands of candles will illuminate both the space and the performers.
