Justin Bieber's father-in-law Stephen Baldwin has sparked curiosity in his fans after sharing a cryptic video on TikTok.
The video comes after Justin's former mentor Sean 'Diddy' Combs was arrested on sex-trafficking charges. Talking in the video Stephen said: "You have heard the expression the calm before the storm, there is always a calm before the storm, but then so is there another calm after the storm."
Stephen - Justin's wife Hailey Bieber's dad - offered no explanation as to what he was referring to as he continued: "There's a calm and then a storm and then another calm, and in that latter calm is the preparation for... the next storm." The upload comes after Justin was seen breaking down in tears in a resurfaced interview from four years ago as he recalled his disturbing "encounters" in the music industry. The 30-year-old, who is yet to speak out about his former mentor P Diddy's arrest and subsequent incarceration following sex trafficking charges against the rapper, shot to fame as a teenager.
However, despite becoming an overnight success and amassing millions of adoring fans around the world, Justin said the reality was quite different as he gave advice to a then 18-year-old, Billie Eilish, who was just breaking into the music industry.
In an interview in 2020 with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, the Baby star was in tears talking about his experiences as a 15-year-old pop star, saying he wanted to protect Billie as she started out on her journey.
With his head bowed and his voice breaking, he said: "It was hard for me being the music industry and being that young and not knowing where to turn and everyone, you know, telling me they loved me, and, you know, just turn your back on you in a second."
He continued: "If she [Billie] ever needs me I'm going to be here for her... but, yeah, just protecting those moments because people take for granted... encounters...and...I just want to protect her. I don't want her to go through anything I went through. I don't wish that upon anybody." The interview is an uncomfortable watch, with seasoned interviewer, Zane, looking visibly upset as he listens to Justin's recollection of troubling events.
A source close to the singer, who recently welcomed son Jack Blues into the world with his wife Hailey, told People the new dad has been "in a happy bubble" since Jack was born and "just wants to focus on being a great dad and husband."
