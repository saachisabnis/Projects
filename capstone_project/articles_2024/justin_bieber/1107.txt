 Hailey Baldwin Bieber is showing her love for Justin Bieber on his special day.

 On Friday the Rhode founder, 27, paid tribute to her husband on Instagram for his 30th birthday.

 "30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!!🥹😭 that was fast," Hailey wrote in the caption. "words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍."

 The post featured photos throughout Hailey and Justin's relationship, including pictures from their wedding and vacations. Hailey included a black and white home video of the couple kissing, as well as a childhood photo of her husband. Another picture in the gallery featured a birthday cake with "30 Justin" written on it.

 The model's sweet birthday shout-out to the "Peaches" singer comes just two days after the pair were spotted looking serious while arriving at the Churchome Church at Saban Theatre in Los Angeles for a late-night church service.

 Hailey was spotted in a neon yellow argyle sweater and a pair of baggy jeans, which she paired with bronze-tinted sunglasses, a black leather purse and red lipstick.

 The "Baby" performer was clad in a gray hooded sweatshirt and and white trousers with a black scarf wrapped around his head.

 The celebrity couple — whose faith has long bonded them together — arrived to the church service in their Tesla Cybertruck, per the New York Post's Page Six.

 Earlier on Wednesday, Hailey's father Stephen Baldwin publicly shared a post from Victor Marx, the founder of All Things Possible Ministries, that featured a prayer request for Hailey and Justin.

 In the post, the pop star can be seen playing the guitar and crooning to “I Could Sing of Your Love Forever” by Delirious? and Hillsong Worship.

 “Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord,” the clip's text read, per Page Six.

 In the caption, Marx explained he "seldom" posts about public figures "because of the negative comments we get."

 "Eileen and Hailey’s mom pray often together for J&H and our children as well. There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face and also the enemy doesn’t want them to draw closer to Jesus. So often regardless of the material things or the accolades they often face spiritual warfare that intense and seeks to ship-wreck their faith , marriage and life in general. So thank you," he continued.

 Earlier this month, Hailey and Justin were spotted coupled up at the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, where they watched the Kansas City Chiefs battle the San Francisco 49ers at Allegiant Stadium.
