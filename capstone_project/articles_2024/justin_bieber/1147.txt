“I think a lot of times in life, we have to go through these deep challenges or ‘burns’,” Hailey Bieber said in an interview earlier this week. “In order to come out on the other side and bloom into the person you were always meant to be.” The model was speaking about Saint Laurent’s new fragrance, for which she is the face, but could just as reasonably have been delivering a sermon at Churchome.
The expectant mother was yesterday afternoon photographed leaving the Beverly Hills congregation in a contemporary interpretation of the term “Sunday best”: an outsized biker jacket, flared leggings, a leopard-print Saint Laurent bag and sling-back kitten heels, which have, of course, accompanied the model throughout her third trimester. Justin Bieber, for his part, wore Louis Vuitton slippers and a bucket hat, as if already bedding down for the comfort-driven look of new parenthood.
The Biebers have often credited the success of their relationship to a shared sense of faith, but this is perhaps only secondary to their service to clothes. Even if the end result is not always harmonious, these two understand that it is a moral—and perhaps even spiritual—obligation to dress with intention. It’s about living life with purpose, putting your best foot forward, and showing reverence for something greater than yourself.
