For the last time, Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber are not headed for divorce. At least, so says the insider who spoke to People on April 3. Rumors that the Biebers’ marriage is on the rocks have been swirling since Hailey’s father, Stephen Baldwin, requested prayers for the couple in a cryptic Instagram Stories post in February.
“There’s no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever,” People’s source claimed. “They are very, very happy.” This statement seems to echo what Hailey Bieber herself posted in an Instagram story back in March. “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong…Made out of thin air…Come from the land of delusion…,” she wrote. “So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it.”

You’d be hard-pressed to find any evidence of an imminent breakup on their social media, that’s for sure. They continue to feature prominently in one another’s IG grids, even if Justin’s captions are usually a little less eloquent than his wife’s. In her Instagram birthday message to Justin on March 1, Hailey wrote, “Words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍.” They are also still regularly seen out in public together, holding hands as normal, as when they were spotted attending an evening church service in February.
And yet the rumors persist.
