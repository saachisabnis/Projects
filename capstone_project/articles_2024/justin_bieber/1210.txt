Hailey Bieber's dad Stephen Baldwin called her a "great gal" who helped her husband Justin Bieber "survive." 
Stephen Baldwin thinks his daughter Hailey Bieber has been a positive influence on her husband Justin Bieber’s life.
“I am just glad he connected with a great gal to help him survive,” Stephen told the Daily Mail on Sept. 13. “Their happiness and their wellbeing and their health is more obviously now better than ever.”
The 58-year-old said that he spent some time with the “What Do You Mean” singer leading up to their 2018 courthouse nuptials.
“Look early on meeting Justin, getting to know him, I hung out with him a bit before I said he could marry my daughter,” Stephen shared of the pop star. “But one of the simple things I told them was, ‘you decide your normal. You decide...you and Hailey will decide your normal.’”
The couple, who welcomed son Jack Blues Bieber in August, are currently in their baby bubble, according to Grandpa Stephen.
“They're just spending really sweet, private quality time with Jack and we're just getting ready to watch him come out on the world here, come out on the scene,” the Usual Suspects star said. “They know what they're doing. And baby Jack is here. We are excited.”
Stephen called his new grandson “incredibly cute,” offering up his babysitting services. “Sometimes grandpa can clean up. You know what I'm saying?”
Prior to welcoming Jack, Hailey previously opened up about her relationship with her relatives.
“I’m not super close with my family at this point in my life because I feel like I’m very independent,” Hailey explained to W magazine in an interview published July 23. “I’m my own individual now, and I’ve built my own family. But when I look back on my childhood and how I grew up, I have very fond, beautiful memories.”
