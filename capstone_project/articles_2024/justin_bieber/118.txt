In a groundbreaking collaboration, Elvis Crespo, RKM, and Jorge Celedón unveil ‘El Hilo,’ blending urban, vallenato, and unique ukelele strings, marking a vibrant departure from traditional tropical rhythms.
In the evolving landscape of Latin music, a new collaboration stands out, symbolizing a fresh direction and the seamless fusion of diverse musical genres. The project in question is ‘El Hilo,’ a single that brings together the talents of Elvis Crespo, the merengue maestro; RKM, a figure synonymous with the reggaeton genre; and Jorge Celedón, the Colombian vallenato virtuoso. This triad has produced a song that captivates the brain with its fun and engaging rhythm and demonstrates the artists’ ability to transcend traditional musical boundaries.
In a revealing interview with EFE, Elvis Crespo shared his insights into the necessity for music to be “very fun to captivate the brain.” True to his words, ‘El Hilo’ is a testament to this philosophy. Launched under Crespo’s Flash Music label, the track introduces a reggaeton base layered with the distinct sounds of the ukelele—a small guitar embraced by Hawaiian culture—and the flute, creating an innovative and refreshing blend.
Historically, the intersection of different musical styles has often led to the creation of groundbreaking works. From the cross-pollination of African rhythms with European instruments that gave birth to genres like merengue and salsa to the modern-day fusion of urban beats with traditional sounds, music has continuously evolved by integrating diverse influences. ‘El Hilo’ is a modern embodiment of this tradition, signifying a bold step into uncharted territories.
The inception of ‘El Hilo’ traces back to an unexpected meeting between Crespo and RKM at an airport in the previous year’s summer. RKM, inspired by Crespo’s iconic track record, proposed a collaboration. Initially, Crespo was presented with a merengue-style track, which did not resonate with him. However, upon hearing a version that included the ukelele, Crespo was captivated and agreed to lend his voice to the project. This pivotal moment began a creative journey that eventually involved Celedón, adding a distinct Colombian flavor to the mix.
Crespo’s willingness to step out of his comfort zone and embrace the reggaeton base, infused with the acoustic charm of the ukelele and the essence of vallenato, indicates a broader trend within the music industry. Artists are increasingly seeking to experiment and blend genres, thereby creating sounds that are unique and universally appealing. Crespo, renowned for his merengue hits, views his participation in ‘El Hilo’ as an opportunity to explore new musical landscapes and present his audience with “new and unexpected gifts.”
The collaboration has also been a significant achievement for RKM, marking it as one of the most important milestones in his musical career. The song, according to RKM, possesses the potential to touch hearts and transcend generations, highlighting the timeless nature of music that successfully bridges different cultural and musical elements.
For Crespo, the venture into collaborations with reggaeton artists has been around for a while. His discography boasts collaborations with some of the most recognized names in the urban music scene, including Daddy Yankee, Tito ‘El Bambino,’ and Farruko. These partnerships underscore Crespo’s openness to experimentation and desire to remain relevant in a rapidly changing musical landscape.
‘El Hilo’ emerges as a symbol of artistic innovation and cultural fusion. It reflects the artists’ collective endeavor to push the boundaries of traditional music genres, creating a sound that is not only different but also deeply engaging. The song celebrates the creative spirit, showcasing how music can serve as a bridge between diverse cultures and genres and highlighting the endless possibilities that arise when artists dare to explore new horizons.
The recent collaboration on ‘El Hilo’ by Elvis Crespo, RKM, and Jorge Celedón is not an isolated incident in Latin music but part of a broader tradition of genre-blending that has characterized the industry for decades. This fusion of urban, vallenato, and the unique sound of the ukelele strings in ‘El Hilo’ is a testament to Latin music’s dynamic and evolving nature, reflecting a deep-rooted history of musical experimentation and cross-cultural exchange.
Historical precedents for such innovative collaborations can be traced back to the early interactions between African, European, and Indigenous musical traditions in Latin America, which gave rise to genres like salsa, merengue, and cumbia. These genres were born of fusion and innovation, setting the stage for contemporary artists to continue pushing the boundaries of musical expression.
In the 1970s and 1980s, artists like Carlos Santana brought Latin rock to the forefront, mixing rock with Latin American jazz and salsa. Santana’s collaborations, particularly the iconic ‘Oye Como Va,’ exemplify the potential of cross-genre fusion to create hits that resonate across cultural boundaries.
The 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of reggaeton, a genre that itself is a fusion of hip-hop, dancehall, and reggae with Latin rhythms. Artists like Daddy Yankee and Don Omar were pivotal in blending traditional Latin sounds with urban music, paving the way for the genre’s mainstream success.
Another notable collaboration highlighting the fusion of distinct musical styles was ‘La Tortura’ by Shakira and Alejandro Sanz in 2005. The song combined elements of pop, rock, and traditional Latin sounds, becoming an international hit and showcasing the universal appeal of genre-blending tracks.
In recent years, the global success of ‘Despacito’ by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, marked a milestone in the fusion of Latin music with mainstream pop, reaching audiences worldwide and demonstrating the commercial viability of such collaborations.
‘El Hilo’ stands on the shoulders of these musical milestones, illustrating the continuous evolution of Latin music through the integration of diverse musical elements. Crespo, with his merengue background; RKM, from the urban reggaeton scene; and Celedón, representing vallenato, together have created a song that transcends the conventional boundaries of genre, much like the collaborations of their predecessors.
These fusion projects enrich the musical tapestry of Latin America and foster a greater understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural expressions. They highlight the creativity and innovation inherent in Latin music, proving that the fusion of different styles can lead to groundbreaking and universally appealing new genres.
‘El Hilo’ encapsulates the spirit of exploration and experimentation, underscoring the artist’s commitment to creating music that is fun and engaging and reflective of a rich heritage of musical fusion. As Crespo mentioned, stepping out of one’s comfort zone and embracing new sounds is crucial for growth and relevance in the fast-paced music world.
