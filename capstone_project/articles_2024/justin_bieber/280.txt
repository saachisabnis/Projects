With Diddy having landed in hot water this week, an old video featuring Khloe Kardashian has resurfaced, showing her reminiscing about her times at one of the rap titan's legendary parties.
A blast from the past sees a scene from a 2014 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, titled "Secrets of a Double Life", with Khloe discussing her evening out at a Diddy bash to her sibling Kourtney Kardashian. Filmed amidst the plush surroundings of Khloe's wardrobe, she spilled on her experience, sharing that Justin Bieber was also amongst the guests. The pop star would've been a mere 20-years-old at that time.
During the conversation with Kourtney, hidden in the depths of a closet, Khloe exclaimed: "I got on a plane at 5.30am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked."
She coyly added: "You would have loved it."
On being quizzed by Kourtney: "Who was with you this weekend?" Khloe listed her companions, revealing: "Diddy. Quincy. Justin Bieber..." and confirmed their presence, stating: "So far, so good", reports the Mirror.
The Mirror US last week published claims from P Diddy's lawyer, contending that the rapper's notorious "freak off" soirees are "a lifestyle not a crime".
Adding fuel to the fire, another clip now making rounds online shows Khloe and Kourtney conversing with the hip-hop mogul during an episode of "Kocktails with Khloe" in 2016. Amidst the dialogue that has ignited conversations on Reddit, Khloe stated: "Well, I know you're known for the parties. When you think of a party or a good time, you think of Puff."
Diddy simply uttered, "Yeah," whereas Khloe added with a hint of reminiscence: "We've been known to party with you a few times."
Casting a glance at her sibling Kourtney, she inquired, "Do you remember Diddy's birthday? " to which Kourtney admitted: "Yes, I forgot about that. That was an epic night too."
Intrigued by the past event, Khloe pressed for more: "Why was it so epic? " Kourtney recalled: "That night was fun 'cause all the girls ditched me, so it was like me and the boys. It was me, Kanye [West], Corey [Gamble], T [Tyga] just chilling, which was really fun."
After the arrest of Diddy became hot gossip around the globe with him now held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, tales of his infamous parties are spreading like wildfire across social media. The disgraced star faces severe charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution.
Diddy has entered a plea of not guilty as of Tuesday, with his lawyers suggesting a massive $50 million bail amount alongside a proposal for house arrest. However, Judge Tarnofsky wasn't swayed, deciding instead to keep the star detained behind bars.
Following P Diddy's arrest, his fabled extravagant parties have come into question, as attendees reveal stories of extravagance and excess at these events hosted by the hip-hop legend. Allegations now shocking the public include the use of controlled substances, covert filming, and engagement of sex workers at these gatherings, with reports implicating Diddy and other staff of Combs Enterprises.

Diddy's legal eagle, Marc Agnifilo, has come out swinging in defence of his client. Speaking outside the New York courthouse, he proclaimed: "Mr Combs is a fighter, he's going to fight this to the end. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his innocence. He's not afraid, he's not afraid of the charges.
"There's nothing that the government said in their presentation today that changes anyone's mind about anything. He's been looking forward to this day. He's been looking forward to clearing his name and he's going to clear his name and we're going to stand by his side as he does."
