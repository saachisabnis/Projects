Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” crowns the Billboard Hot 100 for an 18th total week. The carol, which leads for a fourth consecutive week this holiday season, moves to within one week of the longest domination in the chart’s 66-year history, after only the 19-week rules of Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” this year and Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, in 2019.

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” was originally released on Carey’s album Merry Christmas in November 1994 and, as streaming has grown and holiday music has become more prominent on streaming services’ playlists, it hit the Hot 100’s top 10 for the first time in December 2017, and the top five for the first time in the 2018 holiday season. It led at last, prior to the past four weeks, over the holidays in 2019 (for three weeks), 2020 (two), 2021 (three), 2022 (four) and 2023 (two).

	The track also holds at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart for a record-extending 22nd week, leads Digital Song Sales for a sixth week and hits the Radio Songs top 10 for the first time.

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” became Carey’s 19th Hot 100 No. 1, the most among soloists and one away from The Beatles’ overall record 20. It also made Carey the first artist to have ranked at No. 1 on the chart in four distinct decades (1990s, 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s).

	In a historic first, the Hot 100’s top 10 consists entirely of holiday hits. In fact, the top 16 spots on the chart belong to seasonal songs; Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” is the top non-Yuletide title, at No. 17 after reaching No. 2. Previously, holiday songs hit a high by infusing the top eight positions a year ago this week (along with nine of the top 10 last week, a year ago this week and four years ago this week).

	Among the Hot 100’s top 10, Ariana Grande “Santa Tell Me” dashes 9-5, becoming only the eighth holiday song in the chart’s history to reach the top five, and Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)” returns to the tier (14-10, after reaching No. 9).

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 4, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 31).

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You,” on Columbia Records/Legacy Recordings, drew 71.9 million streams (up 50% week-over-week) and 35.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 23%) and sold 8,000 downloads and physical singles combined (down 23%) in the U.S. Dec. 20-26, according to Luminate. (Boosting the song’s sales for a third week, 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl and cassette and CD singles were released Dec. 6, in honor of its 30th anniversary.)

	The track holds at No. 1 on Streaming Songs for a record-padding 22nd week – while its 71.9 million streams mark the most ever for a holiday song in a single week. Before this week, Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” boasted the most weekly streams among holiday titles (57.3 million a year ago this week); that classic now claims the second-biggest such frame, with 71.3 million streams in the latest tracking week (up 48%), followed by Wham!’s “Last Christmas” (69.6 million, up 51%) and Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” (64.8 million, up 46%).

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” tops Digital Song Sales for a sixth week, stretching to its first week at No. 1 in December 2005.

	Plus, the song soars 16-7 on Radio Songs, surpassing its prior No. 11 best and reaching the top 10 for the first time 30 years after its release. (It initially peaked at No. 12 over the 1994 holiday season.) Carey notches her 24th career Radio Songs top 10 and first since “Obsessed” hit No. 6 in 2009. She logged her first top 10, and first of 11 No. 1s, with “Love Takes Time” upon the chart’s December 1990 start (after her chart career launched with her previous single and debut smash “Vision of Love”). Carey ties Drake for the second-most Radio Songs top 10s, after only Rihanna’s 30. (Rihanna is the only act with more No. 1s on the survey than Carey, with 13.)

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” sports the third-longest command among the 1,176 total No. 1s dating to the Hot 100’s Aug. 4, 1958, start. (The seven longest-leading songs have reigned since the list adopted electronically-monitored Luminate data in November 1991, at which point longer No. 1 stays than before subsequently became more common.)

	Here is a recap of the longest-leading Hot 100 No. 1s:

	Now up to 18 weeks, “All I Want for Christmas Is You” extends its mark as the holiday song with the most time logged atop the Hot 100, among three Yuletide leaders. “The Chipmunk Song,” by The Chipmunks with David Seville, led for four weeks beginning in December 1958, followed by Brenda Lee’s three weeks last holiday season with “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” (also released in 1958).

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” extends the longest span from a song’s first week at No. 1 on the Hot 100 to its latest to five years and two weeks, from the charts dated Dec. 21, 2019, through latest, Dec. 28, 2024-dated list.

	Carey has the second-longest span for an artist atop the Hot 100: 34 years and five months, dating to her first week at No. 1 (Aug. 4, 1990) with “Vision of Love.” Only Lee boasts a longer career stretch of topping the chart: 63 years, five months and three weeks, from “I’m Sorry” (July 18, 1960) through “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” (Jan. 6, 2024).

	Carey collects her record-extending 97th week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, across her 19 leaders, dating back to the chart’s inception.

	Here’s a recap of the artists with the most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Hot 100:

	With the latest Hot 100 dated Jan. 4, 2025, Carey has now placed at No. 1 in a record-extending 21 distinct years (per Hot 100 chart dates), encompassing her 19 leaders: 1990-2000, 2005-06, 2008 and, thanks to “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” 2019-25.

	That’s more than double the totals of the next highest four acts that have each spent time atop the Hot 100 in 10 individual years: Paul McCartney/Wings (1971, 1973-76, 1978, 1980, 1982-84; additionally, The Beatles, with him as a member, led in seven years: 1964-70); Beyoncé (2003, 2006-09, 2017-18, 2020, 2022, 2024; plus, Destiny’s Child, with her as a member, ruled in three years: 1999-2001); Michael Jackson (1972, 1979-80, 1983-84, 1987-88, 1991-92, 1995; also, The Jackson 5, with him in the group, led in 1970); and Madonna (1984-87, 1989-92, 1995, 2000).

	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” concurrently tops Billboard’s multimetric Holiday 100 chart, leading for a 65th week, of the chart’s 73 total weeks since the list originated in 2011.

	The anthem also rules as the top title on Billboard’s Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs chart.

	Holiday hits comprise the Hot 100’s entire top 10 – and top 16 – for the first time, aided by the chart’s tracking week encompassing Dec. 20-26, thus, six days leading up to and including Christmas Day. (Next week’s chart, dated Jan. 11, 2025, is set for the resurgences of nonseasonal songs, reflecting the Dec. 27-Jan. 2 tracking week.)

	Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” holds at No. 2 on the Hot 100; Wham!’s “Last Christmas,” from 1984, keeps at its No. 3 best; and Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock,” from 1957, is steady at No. 4 after reaching No. 3 Hot 100.

	Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me,” from 2014, jingles 9-5 on the Hot 100, with 42 million streams (up 52%), 11.4 million in airplay audience (up 27%) and 9,000 downloads and physical singles sold (up 758%) – making it the week’s top-selling song among all configurations, after a 10th-anniversary single with new artwork was released Dec. 20 on cassette, CD and 7-inch vinyl. Grade tallies her 16th career top five Hot 100 hit (among 23 top 10s), as the song becomes only the eighth holiday song in the chart’s history to reach the top five (among 16 such top 10s).

	Burl Ives’ “A Holly Jolly Christmas,” released in 1964, slips 5-6 on the Hot 100, after peaking at No. 4; Andy Williams’ “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year,” from 1963, holds at No. 7, after hitting No. 5; Dean Martin’s “Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,” from 1959, repeats at No. 8, after reaching No. 7; Kelly Clarkson’s “Underneath the Tree,” from 2013, ascends a spot to a new No. 9 high, a week after reaching the top 10 for the first time; and Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You),” which the late legend first recorded in 1946, returns to the tier (14-10, after hitting No. 9).

	Plus, here are the six songs that round out the unprecedented all-holiday top 16 carols on the Hot 100: José Feliciano’s “Feliz Navidad” (16-11); Michael Bublé’s “It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas” (15-12); The Ronettes’ “Sleigh Ride” (17-13); Chuck Berry’s “Run Rudolph Run” (21-14); Darlene Love’s “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” (23-15); and Perry Como and the Fontane Sisters’ “It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas,” with Mitchell Ayres and his Orchestra (24-16).

	Of the Hot 100’s top 25, holiday songs account for 23 positions. Along with Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ nonseasonal “Die With a Smile” at No. 17, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” ranks at No. 24.
