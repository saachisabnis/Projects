Usher's celebration of his much-lauded Super Bowl halftime show was sabotaged by pesky fact-checking fans.
The R&B singer performed some his biggest hits and included big name guests, such as Alicia Keys, will.i.am, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., Lil Jon and Ludacris on Sunday in Las Vegas.
Following the big event, Usher took to X, formerly Twitter, to celebrate a mind-boggling stat about his performance.
According to a post by Front Office Sports, "Usher's Super Bowl LVIII halftime performance was the most-watched ever—averaging 129.3 million viewers."
The singer shared that post to his own page with the caption: "Thank U to all 129.3 million of U 🙏🏾."
But he soon had his bubble burst with X users who added a context box below his tweet which corrected the claim.
"Michael Jackson's halftime performance continues to hold the record as the highest-rated in history, with 133.4 million US viewers tuning in," the fact-check read, and including a list of links to sources confirming the fact.
"Twitter/X couldn't let Usher have his moment 🤦‍♂️ lol," joked a fan in Usher's replies.
Thank U to all 129.3 million of U 🙏🏾 https://t.co/Swe4bXrRQ3
But others were appreciative of the show Usher put on regardless.
"You really deserve your flowers! 💐," wrote one person.
And another added: "It was one of the most entertaining halftime shows ever. You were fantastic."
During the 15-minute show, Usher stripped off and rollerbladed, also treating fans to several classics including "My Boo," "Burn" and "U Got it Bad," before finishing the show with his mega-hit "Yeah."
While thousands of people flocked to social media to praise Usher, many were mad his long-time collaborator and good friend Justin Bieber did not appear on stage with him.
Usher signed a teenage Bieber to his record label in 2009 and they have worked together many times in the years since.
Bieber did attend the game with his wife, Hailey Bieber, but surprisingly did not perform at the halftime show at the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.
Usher told Newsweek after his show that he was happy his show was well received.
"I was not exaggerating when I shared with the world that my performance would be a celebration of the past 30 years of my career," he said in a statement. "I will never forget the energy from the cast and crew, the fans in the stadium, the guest performers and the adrenaline from this monumental milestone in my career. I'm so happy everyone enjoyed it, my goal always is to bring people together and feel good through my music and performance."
