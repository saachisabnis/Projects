The music world is in mourning after the tragic death of rapper Chris King, who was fatally shot in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 20. 
Chris, whose birth name was Christopher Cheeks, was only 32 years old when his life was abruptly ended in an alley between Hayes and Church Streets while spending time with friends.
According to the Nashville Police Department, Chris and his group were approached by three men unknown to them. Initially, the encounter was cordial, but it escalated quickly as the suspects attempted to rob them, leading to gunfire. 
Tragically, Chris was struck and later succumbed to his injuries at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
A 29-year-old man, also part of Chris's group, was injured during the incident but survived. He recounted the horrifying moments to the police, noting that they were all hanging out before the violence erupted. 
The police have confirmed that their homicide unit detectives are actively pursuing strong leads in the investigation.
The news of Chris's untimely death has shaken friends, family, and fans alike. Among those expressing their grief was pop superstar Justin Bieber, who took to Instagram to share his sorrow and condolences.
 "Love you bro. This one hurts. Please keep his family in your prayers," Justin wrote, reflecting on their close friendship. "See you in paradise brother." 
It was well-known that Chris and Justin were once roommates and had lived together for over a year nearly a decade ago. Chris often spoke of their enduring friendship, celebrating it in a heartfelt post in December 2023.
The loss was also felt deeply by rapper Trippie Redd, who credited Chris with significantly impacting his career and introducing him to key figures in the music industry.
