Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber are taking their time when it comes to thinking about continuing to expand their family, a source exclusively tells Page Six.
The “Sorry” singer, 30, and the model, 28, “have discussed having more kids, but for right now, they’re happy with where things are at,” the insider says.
Justin and Hailey welcomed their son, Jack Blues, in August, three months after the Rhode founder’s  pregnancy news made headlines.
“Hailey feels incredibly blessed to be celebrating her first Christmas as a mom,” the source tells Page Six.
“When Justin asked Hailey what she wanted for Christmas this year, she really couldn’t think of anything because she has everything she could ever want.”
We’re told the happy couple — who tied the knot in September 2018 — are “still adjusting to life as parents of a newborn“ and feel that “every day is a learning experience.”
“They couldn’t be happier,” the insider reveals. 
“Hailey has seen a whole different side to Justin since becoming a father and she’s more in love with him than ever.”
As Page Six previously reported, the beauty entrepreneur took to her Instagram Story over the weekend to show off a new ring featuring side-by-side birthstones for herself and her infant son.
The “toi et moi” style, which is French for “you and me,” is a personalized bauble with an emerald-shaped stone paired with a pear-shaped stone set on a gold band.
Hailey pointed out that the peridot signifies Jack’s birth month of August, while the pear-shaped citrine was for “Mama.”
Reps for Hailey and Justin did not immediately respond to Page Six’s requests for comment.
