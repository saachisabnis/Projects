Tate McRae might not be jet skiing again anytime soon.
During a Wednesday, October 9, appearance on Capital Radio, McRae, 21, opened up to host Jimmy Hill about a harrowing experience she had while on vacation with her boyfriend, The Kid Laroi, this summer.
“[You had] a quite scary accident over the summer on a jet ski. … You fell off and nearly got eaten by a whale,” Hill prompted.
“I didn’t realize what I was getting myself into,” McRae replied. “You know you have trust in your boyfriend, but also jet skis are the worst. They flip over every two seconds.”
McRae went on to explain that she and Laroi, also 21, fell into the water about “10 feet away” from a whale at one point.
“I was like, ‘We nearly just landed in a whale’s mouth!’” she recalled. “That’s so freaky to me, the ocean is just a really freaky thing to me, you’re just in there and it’s black and your toes are dangling and that’s so weird.”
While the couple were unharmed, McRae felt keenly aware of how vulnerable they were.
“I got that feeling when we fell in the water and you’re just tingling at the bottom of your feet and you’re like, ‘We could die right now,’” she said.
Despite being skeptical of his jet ski driving abilities, McRae has been going strong with Laroi since sparking romance rumors in January. The Australian rapper seemingly confirmed their relationship in April when he referred to McRae as his “girlfriend” during a concert in Dublin.
The duo went on to perform together during McRae’s Madison Square Garden debut in August. McRae brought Laroi on stage to sing an acoustic version of his song “Without You,” telling the crowd it was their “first time singing together.”

Laroi gave McRae a kiss at the end of the performance and said, “I’m so proud of you, and you have so many people in here that love you. I’m one of them.
Laroi was once again by his girlfriend’s side at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. He was photographed with his arm around McRae, who was nominated for Best Pop and Best Choreography, and gave her a kiss on the cheek. Laroi also shared some snaps from the night via Instagram, including a photo of himself and the “Greedy” singer.
“Willingly went to an award show last night and I actually had a blast,” he wrote in the caption.
