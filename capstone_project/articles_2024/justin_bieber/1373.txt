Usher opting to execute a set that focused squarely on a bygone era of showmanship is why he’s in a league of his own. The mic was on. No track. A skate sequence. Fluid choreography. He took his time onstage and it was exquisite. #Usher #SuperBowl

Sure enough, Queen Bey updated her website to share that “Act II” would be dropping on March 29. She also teased two new tracks, “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages.”
