The Kardashians star Kendall Jenner, who ditched her blonde hairdo earlier this month to return to the brunette lifestyle, has cut her hair even shorter, donning her shortest haircut to date.
Kendall Jenner’s hair is growing in reverse.
Amid a season of major hair changes, the 29-year-old took her recent haircut even further, proving that maybe blondes don’t have more fun. 
While attending the FWRD & Revolve Holiday Shop at The Grove in Los Angeles Nov. 15, Kendall rocked her new chin-length brunette bob, noticeably shorter than the neck-length ‘do she debuted earlier this month.
The 818 Tequila founder complemented her caramel locks by sporting a brown Tom Ford jacket with a deep V-neck cut, black Alexander McQueen trousers and brown pointed heels from The Row.
Though she didn’t share the inspiration behind the ‘do, she recently donned a similar style in a September Calvin Klein ad, drawing comparisons to her mom Kris Jenner.
Kendall’s new hairdo may be her shortest cut to date, but it’s not the only recent change to her look. In a Nov. 12 Instagram post, she revealed she has returned to her dark roots with a series of topless pictures by fashion photographer Mert Alas. 
Later that same day, the Kardashians star stepped out to Sushi Park, a celebrity favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, flaunting her new locks. 
The return to the brunette lifestyle was also a stark shift from the blonde hair Kendall had been sporting for months before. After the end of New York Fashion Week in September, she shared an Instagram post to reveal she had gone blonde, simply writing in the caption of the post, “blonded.”
As for the inspiration for the supermodel’s blonde ‘do? Celebrity Colorist Jenna Perry—who also helped Kendall with her 2022 redhead look—shared some insight. 
“It took me two days to take her this gorgeous shade of golden blonde,” Jenna told Vogue in September. “She is really inspired by the ’90s and Caroline Bessette-Kennedy right now.”
