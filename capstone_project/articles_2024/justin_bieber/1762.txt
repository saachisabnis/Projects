She must spend all year planning these
Hey, at least Hailey Bieber isn’t boring. Her commitment to Halloween is matched only by Heidi Klum. Here is an overly detailed ranking of all Hailey Bieber’s Halloween outfits over the last five years.

No, that’s not a typo. For Halloween in 2022, Hailey wore a replica of an outfit worn by Laetitia Casta in a 1999 fashion show.
Look, I’m sure this is a hilarious reference if you’re a millionaire supermodel. But us mere mortals are not going to get this reference without a reverse Google image search. Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.
In 2023, Hailey ran through three different costumes and we’re deeply impressed.
She did a whole photoshoot as Drew Decker from the 2000 parody horror film Scary Movie.  The pics are pain-stakingly recreating the moment when the monster Ghostface uses a dagger to rip out Drew’s silicone breast implant.
I get that lots of effort went into the photo shoot, but Hailey’s actual outfit was pretty easy. Surely she wears a bra and pants all year round?
For Halloween 2021, Hailey and Justin Bieber went to Michael Braun’s Halloween outfit dressed as Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear from The Jungle Book. Not gonna lie, I think this is an extremely cute and quirky couples’ Halloween costume idea.

This year, Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner wore matching Halloween outfits. The girlies recreated a scene from The Simple Life – the 2000s comedy show with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Honestly, when you compare the show’s poster to Hailey and Kendall’s fits, they got it pretty much spot-on.

Hailey also dressed up as all the plastics from Mean Girls in 2023. This is a deeply iconic move, considering how lots of hardcore Selena Gomez fans perceive her as “the nastiest skank b*tch”. Truly, this is the most iconic thing she’s ever done.
