After a mad dash from a Florida courthouse last Friday, platinum-selling recording artist Sean Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, were arraigned and pleaded “not guilty” on Monday.
At the arraignment, Kingston, real name Kisean Anderson, and mom entered pleas to Broward Circuit’s Judge Ernest Kollra, who made no changes on the set bond of $90,000. 
“We believe he’s innocent,” Kingston’s attorney, Robert Rosenblatt, told NBC Miami. “We’re looking forward to trying this case either in state or federal court, or both if necessary.”
The charges against the 34-year-old performer and his 61-year-old mother include organized fraud and grand theft. Kingston was originally arrested in May at Fort Irwin, California, after a SWAT team raided his home in Southwest Ranches on a warrant issued by the Broward Sheriff’s Office.
According to arrest documents, Kingston and his mother are accused of defrauding a jewelry business, a luxury bed company, a used luxury and exotic car dealership, and a luxury microLED TV company since October 2023. They are expected to return to court on October 11 and are also facing related charges in federal court.
If convicted, each defendant faces up to 20 years in prison on each count, according to the Southern District of Florida. 
Sean Kingston achieved chart-topping success in the early 2000s with the hit songs, “Beautiful Girl,” “Fire Burning,” and “Take You There.” His catalog includes collaborations with Justin Bieber, Soulja Boy, and Nipsey Hussle. 
Kingston released his latest album, Road To Deliverance, in 2022 via EMPIRE.
