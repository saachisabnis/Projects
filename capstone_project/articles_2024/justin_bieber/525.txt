Taylor Swift achieves one of the most record-shattering weeks in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart – surpassing unprecedented heights that she previously set – as she claims the top 14 positions on the survey dated May 4. All 14 songs, led by “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, are from her new album, The Tortured Poets Department, which, following the Republic Records set’s April 19 release, blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart.

	Swift was already the only artist ever to dominate the Hot 100’s entire top 10 — thanks to tracks from her last album of all-new material, Midnights, in 2022, led by the collection’s “Anti-Hero.”

	Among other new chart feats for Swift, “Fortnight” becomes her 12th Hot 100 No. 1, as she ties for the sixth-most leaders in the chart’s archives; she ups her career count of top 10s from 49 to 59, the most among women; and she charts 32 songs – all 31 from the deluxe version of The Tortured Poets Department plus established smash “Cruel Summer” – on the latest list overall, the most ever in a single week by a woman.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 4, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 30.

	Below is a look at Swift’s latest groundbreaking week on the Hot 100.

	Swift ranks at Nos. 1 through 14 on the Hot 100, rewriting the record week that she logged on the Nov. 5, 2022-dated chart when she became the first artist to boast the entire top 10 in a single week.

	Here’s a recap of Swift’s songs in the top 14 spots on the May 4-dated Hot 100:

	“Fortnight,” which arrives as the 1,170th No. 1 in the Hot 100’s 65-year history, drew 76.2 million official streams and 31.1 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 19,000 in the U.S. April 19-25.

	The single soars in as Swift’s ninth leader on the Streaming Songs chart, the most among women (and second overall only to Drake’s 20), and her record-extending 29th No. 1 on Digital Song Sales. On the Radio Songs chart, it debuts at No. 14 (Swift’s second-highest entrance, after “Anti-Hero” started at No. 13).

	The premiere of “Fortnight” with 76.2 million streams marks the top total for a song in a single week since YouTube song user-generated content was removed from chart calculations in 2020, surpassing the 76.1 million that Olivia Rodrigo’s “Drivers License” drew in its first frame, as reflected on charts dated Jan. 23, 2021. (With 66.2 million official on-demand streams, “Fortnight” scores the biggest week by that metric since “Drivers License” drew 66.8 million that week.)

	With her 12th Hot 100 No. 1, Swift passes Whitney Houston and ties Madonna and The Supremes for the sixth-most leaders in the chart’s history. Among women, only Mariah Carey (19) and Rihanna (13) have more.

Most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s:

	Here’s a recap of Swift’s 12 Hot 100 No. 1s (with debuts atop the chart noted with *). “Fortnight” is her second leader billed with another artist, following “Bad Blood,” featuring Kendrick Lamar:

	Now with seven No. 1 Hot 100 debuts, Swift ties Ariana Grande for the most among women. Overall, only Drake has more (nine).

	Plus, Swift pushes her total to seven Hot 100 No. 1s in the 2020s, tying Drake for the most this decade. BTS and Grande follow with six No. 1s each in the ‘20s.

	As noted last October, when the revived “Cruel Summer” hit No. 1 on the Hot 100, four years after its release on her 2019 album Lover, Swift tied Rihanna for the most consecutive studio albums of all-new material – seven – each generating at least one Hot 100 No. 1.

	Now, with the reign of “Fortnight,” Swift solely boasts a record eight consecutive albums of all-new music (excluding her rerecorded projects) each spinning off Hot 100 No. 1s. Here’s a recap:

	Department of title tracks: As it debuts at No. 4, “The Tortured Poets Department” becomes Swift’s highest-charting album title cut, and her first top five such entry, on the Hot 100. It passes four others of hers that have also hit the top 10: “Red” (No. 6 peak), “Speak Now” (No. 8), “Fearless” (No. 9) and “Lover” (No. 10).

	Instantly adding 10 new Hot 100 top 10s, Swift becomes the first woman to surpass 50 career top 10s, boosting her total from 49 to 59.

Most Billboard Hot 100 Top 10s:

	Overall, Swift charts 32 songs – all 31 on the deluxe edition of The Tortured Poets Department plus “Cruel Summer” – on the latest Hot 100, the most in a single week by a woman. Only Morgan Wallen has sent more songs onto the chart in a frame: 36, on the March 18, 2023-dated chart, when his album One Thing at a Time roared in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

	As Wallen debuted 27 songs on the Hot 100 that week, Swift’s 31 debuts this week mark the most ever in a single week.

	Swift co-wrote “Fortnight” with Post Malone and Jack Antonoff, the latter of whom also produced it with Swift. Swift has now co-written 12 and co-produced six Hot 100 No. 1s.

	Antonoff adds his sixth Hot 100 No. 1 as both a songwriter and producer. Post Malone notches his fifth leader as a writer.

	Just as Lana Del Rey contributed to Swift’s top 10 takeover on the Hot 100 dated Nov. 5, 2022, as featured on the No. 4 hit “Snow on the Beach,” Post Malone and Florence + The Machine join Swift in her second such achievement.

	With “Fortnight,” Post Malone earns his fifth Hot 100 No. 1 – and first No. 1 debut – and his 12th top 10. Here’s a rundown of his leaders:

	Meanwhile, Florence + The Machine reaches the Hot 100’s top 10 for the first time thanks to the act’s featured billing on “Florida!!!,” at No. 8. Frontwoman Florence Welch previously scored one top 10, as featured on Calvin Harris’ “Sweet Nothing,” which hit No. 10 in February 2013.

	Below Swift’s tracks at Nos. 1 through 14 on the Hot 100, Benson Boone charts the highest hit, as his No. 2-peaking “Beautiful Things” falls 3-15. (When Swift claimed the entire top 10 with tracks from Midnights, Sam Smith and Kim Petras’ “Unholy” halted her haul, ranking at No. 11, a week after it reached No. 1.)

	Hozier’s “Too Sweet,” at No. 16, follows on the newest Hot 100, a week after it rose to No. 1. Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s former three-week leader “Like That” is pushed down 2-17 and Teddy Swims’ former one-week No. 1 “Lose Control” backtracks 4-18, as it tops Radio Songs for a third week (69.5 million in audience, down 1%).
