Turns out, Danny Trejo actually might be wielding a machete soon, as the eponymous franchise is still on track to be a trilogy. During a recent discussion with Rob Zombie for Interview magazine, the almost-80-year-old actor Trejo incorrectly stated that “Machete” and “Machete Kills” director Robert Rodriguez “sold part” of the franchise, and therefore it’s unlikely another will be made. 
“God, I guess Robert [Rodriguez] screwed up and sold part of ‘Machete,'” Trejo said, “to Russians or something. Everyone always asks, ‘When are you doing “Machete Kills in Space?”‘” Director Zombie added that he’d love to see “Machete Kills in Space,” saying, “I thought for sure it was going to happen. It’s so ridiculous.”

However, Rodriguez exclusively told IndieWire that Trejo’s comments are thankfully “incorrect” and a third “Machete” film may still slice up cinemas soon. 
“I retain all the rights,” Rodriguez told IndieWire in an email. “We do plan to make another one, we just stopped saying that we are until we’re actually making it because of all the stories that come out saying, ‘They’re making it right now, they’re making it right now!'” 
He added, “‘Machete’ is one of my favorite characters and Danny and I are always dreaming up the best sequel approach. So yes, the sequel is still very possible. We are just not making it right at this moment.” 
Campy genre exploitation film “Machete” was released in 2010, followed by sequel “Machete Kills,” which co-starred Charlie Sheen, Sofia Vergara, and Mel Gibson. A faux trailer for “Machete Kills in Space” was released in 2013 featuring a robot Justin Bieber. 
Trejo also previously worked with Rodriguez on “Spy Kids,” which he admitted was a daunting project at the time to Interview magazine. “When I did ‘Spy Kids,’ it was, ‘Oh shit, I gotta work with all these kids.’ And these kids are making more money than mommy and daddy, and this kid goes, ‘No, I don’t want to do it.’ And you hear mommy begging him, like, ‘Please, but we got to pay the rent,'” Trejo said. “And I worked with Daryl [Sabara], awesome kid. Well, when he was little, we were doing ‘Spy Kids,’ and we were working with Alexa [PenaVega]. They were 12 and 9, I think. And man, both moms had them under control. I thought, ‘God, I want kids like that.'” 

 









Trejo said in a 2018 “IMDb Me” episode that he doesn’t mind being typecast as a rough and tumble villain. “‘Don’t you think you’re being typecast?’ You’re always playing the mean Chicano dude with tattoos.’ And I thought about it, and I said, ‘Well, I am the mean Chicano dude with tattoos! Go with what you got!'” Trejo said. “Being a glorified extra for so long and being with the troops, it didn’t set me apart from what it’s all about. A lot of people have become stars immediately, and they forget that this is a job for a lot of people and it’s work.”
