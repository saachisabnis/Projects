She’s still his favorite girl.
Justin Bieber and wife Hailey Bieber are reportedly “very happy” despite rumors that they are headed for a divorce.
A source told People that the couple, who secretly wed in 2018, are “doing really well.”
“There’s no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever,” the insider told the outlet. “They are very, very happy.”
The model also squashed divorce rumors Wednesday as she took to her Instagram Story to post an adorable snap of the “Peaches” singer cuddling in bed with their dog.
The update on the duo’s union comes more than a month after Hailey’s father, Stephen Baldwin, reposted a message from minister Victor Marx that asked fans to “say a little prayer” for his daughter and Justin.
“Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord,” Marx wrote atop the clip of Justin playing the guitar and singing.
In the caption, Marx said that his wife, Eileen, and Hailey’s mom, Kennya Baldwin, “often pray together” for the young couple.
“There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face and also the enemy doesn’t want them to draw closer to Jesus,” he claimed in the caption.
“So often regardless of the material things or the accolades they often face spiritual warfare that intense and seeks to ship-wreck their faith, marriage and life in general. So thank you.”
Hailey, 27, was reportedly “pissed” that her dad took family issues publicly. 
Sources close to the Rhode Skin founder told TMZ that she and the two-time Grammy winner were going through a “private” family matter, which the “Usual Suspects” actor, 57, was privy to.

Last month, Hailey shut down concerns about her marriage by sharing a touching tribute on Instagram for her beau’s 30th birthday.
“30!!!!!!!????!!????!!!!🥹😭 that was fast,” she captioned a slideshow of images.
“words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are. Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍.”
Days later, the former “Drop the Mic” host slammed false theories about her marriage to Justin as TikTokers shared “blind items” about the couple.
“Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong. Made out of thin air… come from the land of delusion,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories at the time.
“So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it.”
