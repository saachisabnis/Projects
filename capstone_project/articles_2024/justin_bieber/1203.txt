 Justin Bieber was caught on camera venting his frustration at a group of young fans at a luxury hotel. The 30-year-old singer, appearing disheveled, confronted a group of teens in the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria in West Hollywood, all captured in a brief TikTok video.
… In the footage, Justin can be seen questioning the kids about what they found amusing, signaling for them to move aside. Hotel staff can be observed guiding the teens towards the exit. The singer barked, “Get out of here” in a stern tone.
… Sources disclosed to TMZ that Justin was at the hotel to meet his pregnant wife, Hailey Bieber. However, a group of eight rowdy children from a bar mitzvah began following him around and shouting. Initially, Justin politely asked them to back off due to security concerns, but as they persisted in filming, his frustration grew.
