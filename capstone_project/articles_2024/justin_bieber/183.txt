It's one of the most polarizing cases in the world right now: the case of Sean "Diddy" Combs. The rapper/actor/fashion designer/etc. is facing some serious charges for sex crimes that you've probably already heard about - the feds won't even let him out of custody.
In the months leading up to his arrest, photos and videos of Diddy would surface, showing him pacing and/or looking stressed out. During that time, Diddy decided to hop on a plane and make some rounds... one of those stops included Idaho.
By July of this year (2024), Diddy had already had his home raided by the feds and was facing some serious allegations that included an assault on Cassie Ventura and several other lawsuits.
Things weren't looking good for the former music producer and there were concerns he was going to flee the country in his private jet to avoid being taken in.
He didn't try to escape authorities but he did hop on his private plane to make a few stops before going to New York to turn himself in earlier this month (Sept.).
We were curious to learn more about this private jet and in our research, multiple sources confirmed that a 2015 Gulfstream 5 jet registered to "LoveAir LLC" belonged to Diddy - the name didn't age well, did it?
Using his flight information, we searched flight info from public records and found that Diddy made a brief stop in Idaho on July 7th before he turned himself in to the feds two months later.
There's no word as to what Diddy's business in Coeur d'Alene was but it's no secret that Coeur d'Alene is a hotspot for several celebrities including George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and Matthew McConaughey.
What was Diddy taking care of in northern Idaho two months before turning himself in? Was it simply a stop to refuel or did Diddy need to take care of some business before his empire fell?
