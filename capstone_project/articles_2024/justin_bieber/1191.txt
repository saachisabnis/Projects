Jacob Elordi debuted a dramatically different look as he attended an event in Morocco Nov. 29, sporting some seriously shaggy facial hair.
Jacob Elordi has a euphoric new look.
The Saltburn actor hit the red carpet at Morocco’s Marrakech International Film Festival Nov. 29, trading his typically clean-shaven presentation for a more rugged appearance, debuting a lengthy brown beard and longer locks.
In addition to his dramatic facial hair, Jacob donned a black tuxedo with thick shawl lapels and no tie to the event, completing the ensemble by pinning an eye-catching frog brooch to his collar.
It’s not the first time the 27-year-old has switched up his appearance. In 2023, the Euphoria star got creative with his clippers as he sported a thick mustache in Los Angeles while running errands with his dog, Layla.
And Jacob will soon have a good excuse to play with his look once again. After all, the upcoming third season of the HBO drama—which will begin production in 2025—is set to take place years after the events of season two, which Jacob’s costar Zendaya previously teased.
“I don't quite know exactly what the season is going to look like, but I do know that the time jump is happening,” she told Entertainment Weekly in October. “I know it's important because there's only so much high school drama you can deal with—‘and then she cheats on her boyfriend again!’”
While the fast-forward may be jarring to some viewers, the Emmy winner is looking forward to how it will advance the story.
“It will be fascinating to see and understand these characters outside of the context of high school,” Zendaya went on, “and how all the stuff that we saw when they were kids and they were in high school affects the kind of adulthood they have and who they become in a much bigger world. I'll be interested to see what happens too.”
