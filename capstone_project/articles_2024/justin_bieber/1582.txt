Montana's Best Country
One of the most well-known DJs in the world is hanging out in Montana right now. The state has become a popular retreat for celebrities looking to relax and spend some time out of the public eye. So, why is this popular DJ and music producer in Montana? Here are the details.
Who would've thought that a global music sensational would be spotted spending time in Montana? Instead of in a club with bright flashing lights, Diplo has been hanging out in Big Sky Country. The popular DJ was first spotted at the Under the Big Sky Festival in Whitefish, Montana on Sunday, July 14. He was seen riding alongside Sierra Ferrell on horseback as the performer made her way to the stage. Diplo did not perform at the festival.
Diplo spent a short time in Montana before heading to Mykonos, Greece to perform at Cavo Paradiso Club. While he was here, he spent timeÂ with fellow musicians in Whitefish before getting off the grid to explore the beauty of Montana. Diplo is the lead member of Major Lazer, and has worked with a number of high-profile mainstream artists including Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, Beyonce, and more.
Diplo was in Montana prior to embarking on a world tour that goes through the end of August. He will return to the U.S. on August 31 to perform in Las Vegas, Nevada. From the pictures below, can you figure out where Diplo was in Montana? Let us know! Send us a message on our radio station app.
