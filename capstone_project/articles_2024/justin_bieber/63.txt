Sean Kingston has been extradited to Florida amid his fraud and theft case. The 34-year-old artist was booked into the Broward County jail in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday night, June 2, over a week after he was arrested in Southern California. According to WSVN, Kingston, born Kisean Paul Anderson, faced an arrest warrant after a SWAT team raided his rented home in Southwest Ranches last month, which prompted police to pick him up from Fort Irwin in Californiaâ€™s Mojave Desert. His mother, Janice Turner, was also arrested on the same day. The "Fire Burning" singer had his bail set at $100,000. 
Sean Kingston and his mom are both facing 10 counts including charges of conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, identity theft and related crimes. Kingston also faces a charge of probation violation since he was serving a two-year sentence for trafficking stolen items. Authorities claim Anderson and Turner of stole $480,000 in jewelry, $159,701.49 from a Cadillac Escalade dealer and $86,568.33 from a company that makes customized beds. They also allegedly defrauded First Republic Bank for $100,000 and Bank of America for over $200,000. The charges stem from a lawsuit attorney Dennis Card filed for his client Ver Ver Entertainment. Card's lawsuit details a pattern of fraud and theft from October to March 2024 including his client's 232-inch television and home entertainment system. The company claimed Kingston contacted them through Instagram and told the company he would make promotional videos with Justin Bieber in order to get a discount on the massive LED TV. He put down a $30,000 deposit but he didn't make the promo videos nor did he pay the rest of $150,000 that was owed.
