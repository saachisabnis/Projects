Hailey Bieber looks better than ever just two months after giving birth to her first son, Jack Blues.
Bieber, 27, shared a pic of her postpartum figure via Instagram on Thursday, October 24. In the snap, the Rhode founder, who shares Jack with husband Justin Bieber, scrunched up her brown top, revealing her midriff while posing in front of a mirror. She elevated her Boat Neck Long Sleeve Top from Join Form ($62) with matching Fold Over Shorts ($52).
Before getting completely undone for the day, Hailey donned a full beat including manicured eyebrows, highlighted and blushed cheeks, shadow-winged eyeliner and dark glossy lips. She teamed her glam with an elegant updo and diamond earrings.
‚ÄúNight ‚ú®‚ú®ü™Ω,‚Äù Hailey captioned the post.
Eagle-eyed fans also noticed that her Rhode phone case held an unreleased Lip Tint ‚Äî a white tube that has not yet to hit the market.
Followers were quick to discuss what scent it might be via Instagram. ‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs candy cane or peppermint flavor sheer with sparkle! ‚ú®‚Äù one prayed, as another questioned, ‚ÄúI wonder if it‚Äôs gonna be a holiday scent like gingerbread or hot cocoa or something?‚Äù More gushed about how ‚Äúexcited‚Äù they are. (We are, too!)

That same night, Hailey enjoyed a Rhode event with Justin, 30, and friends Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner.
For the soir√©e, Hailey opted for boss babe‚Äìvibes in an oversized double-breasted blazer, a striped dress shirt and a maroon polka dot tie. She looked even more office-chic with rectangular eyeglasses.
Hailey previously teased a glimpse of her postpartum figure earlier this month via social media. At the time, she wore a cropped Frankie‚Äôs Bikinis Dudley Knit Cardigan ($150) that exposed her lower stomach. She paired the piece with low-waisted jeans.
