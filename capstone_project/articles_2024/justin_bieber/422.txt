Let me tell you about the top female K-pop performers of the present era. The following criteria were used to compile this list: general acclaim, sales, legacy, creativity, and fantasticness.
Members of CL Hyuna, Lee Hyori, Tayeon, Ailee, Sunmi, and BoA are among those we have included! Some of these names are going to generate a ruckus abroad, so keep an eye out if you haven’t heard of them yet!
Hello there! We’re taking a look back at the history of female K-pop artists and presenting our list of the top 7.  The following criteria were used to compile this list: general acclaim, sales, legacy, creativity, and fantasticness.
You still consider fifteen to be a youthful age? Music scouts took notice of BoA, whose real name is Kwon Bo-ah, when she was eleven years old when she went to an audition with her brother. She continued by releasing her debut album, “ID: Peace B,” when she was a ripe 13-year-old.
By releasing “Listen To My Heart” in Japan, BoA became the first Korean artist to debut atop the Oricon chart. Great news! Her 2009 English-language album “BoA” and her 2013 big-screen role in the film “Make Your Move” are both noteworthy. BoA is a phenomenally successful K-Pop act that has a huge fan base in Korea and beyond.
“Lost and Found” was IU’s debut album, released in 2007, when she was only fifteen years old. This marked the beginning of her prolific musical career. (All of a sudden, we don’t feel good enough.)
Despite the success of IU’s subsequent albums, it was 2010’s “Real” and the single “Good Day” from it that catapulted her to pop stardom. She has expanded her career beyond just music to include acting (including a cameo in 2017’s “Real” with Suzy), several television appearances, and an impressive collection of accolades.

She is an activist, record producer, and actress. A quiver full of arrows awaits Lee Hyori. Beginning her musical career in 1998 as a member of the female group Fin. K.L., she released her first solo album, “Stylish,” in 2003.
The video for the song “Hey Girl” from this album was prohibited from television due to its explicit s*xual content; nonetheless, Lee disagrees with the critics who claimed the video’s images were unnecessary. Scandal, though, is money. Lee was the highest-paid female Korean vocalist for a while. “Black” was Lee’s 2017 comeback album, released after a hiatus from the music industry.

Lisa (real name Lalisa Manobal) is a multi-talented Thai performer. The South Korean girl group Blackpink, of which she is a part, made their debut in August 2016 under YG Entertainment. The White Lotus, an HBO series, will include her acting debut in 2025. Lisa recently started her new agency LLOUD.

In addition to being a model, Hyuna is a singer, dancer, and songwriter. She became famous in the late aughts as a member of 4Minute and Wonder Girls, and then in 2010, she did, in fact, start a solo career, performing what she called “performance-oriented music.”
Despite the mixed reception her debut EP “Bubble Pop” received, Hyuna made history as the first female K-pop solo artist to achieve 100 million views on YouTube with the smash hit title song. Boom! Her 2012 appearance in Psy’s “Gangnam Style” was a huge sensation.

In Korea, CL is famous for both her work with 2NE1 and her solo work (we feel a trend!), and she is also a rapper, composer, and vocalist. Her image and fashion choices have made her iconic. Nominations for her song “The Baddest Female” came in multiples.
Scooter Braun, who represents Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Carly Rae Jepsen (but no longer Kanye), is preparing CL to conquer the American music scene, so you might expect to hear a lot more about her soon.
“Taeyeon” Kim Tae-yeon made her debut in 2007 with the girl group Girls’ Generation. She followed in the footsteps of many other musicians by attempting a solo career; in 2015, her debut single “I” debuted, penetrating the Gaon Album Chart in South Korea and peaking at number two.
More than one million digital copies of its title track were sold! That was surpassed by her second extended play (“Why”), which soared to the top of the charts. Since then, Taeyeon has won a plethora of honors, such as four Golden Discs, two Mnet Asian Music honors, two Seoul Music Awards,… the list goes on and on.
