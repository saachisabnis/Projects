Promise "Kiss me, I'm Irish!" isn't on this list. 
Imagine this Tim Burton-esque nightmare: It‚Äôs March 17th, and you‚Äôve just conquered several hours of St.Patrick‚Äôs Day festivities (not always an easy feat!). Your spirits are high, your tongue is green, and you‚Äôve painstakingly sorted through all your pics to find that one perfect shot. But as you go through the motions to post it to your feed, you realize your noggin simply cannot produce an Instagram caption worthy of your iconic and festive photo. Terrifying! A tragedy! Blame the beer!
But fear not, my friend. That‚Äôs where I come in. While you were raging, I was out here rounding up a ton of (dare I say genius?) St. Patrick's Day Instagram captions to accompany your green-and-gold-splashed pics. 90 of 'em, to be exact. Because you deserve to spend less time wracking your brain and more time cheers-ing to ye olde Saint Patrick. Scroll down to take your pick for your pic, then get back to having fun, lass! Sl√†inte üçª!
