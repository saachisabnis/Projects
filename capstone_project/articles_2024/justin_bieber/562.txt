When it comes to summer manicures, Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber totally nailed it.
Taking to Instagram, celebrity manicurist Zola Ganzorigt shared some sweet, coordinating designs she created for the besties, giving fans a close-up at the tiny, barbecue-friendly graphics she painted for the skincare and makeup moguls.
According to Ganzorigt’s caption, Bieber, 27, went with a “farmers market” theme, keeping her nails completely neutral and opting for tiny painted-on images of a carrot, cherries and corn along with other colorful fruits and veggies.
Jenner, 26, on the other hand, chose a yellow French mani with “summer garden” graphics that featured tiny bugs. In the accompanying videos posted by Ganzorigt, she can be seen twisting her hand to show off creepy crawlers including snails, beetles, and even a worm.
It should come as no surprise that this playful nail trend appears to be taking off among the two friends.
While both women are definitely at the forefront of trends when it comes to beauty, with Bieber and Jenner founding Rhode and Kylie Cosmetics, respectively.
Ganzorigt is also the go-to nail artist for some of Hollywood’s biggest names — and quickly sets trends.
In 2022, she famously created Bieber’s “glazed donut” manicure, which went viral after the model debuted the iridescent off-white look at the Met Gala that year.
Later that same year, Ganzorigt gave the viral style a shimmery brown, “chocolate glazed donut” spin before creating holiday-themed “candy cane glazed” tips.
She also caused some waves with a recent Bieber manicure; Fans speculated that the model her cherry blossom nails hinted that the pregnant star is expecting a girl with husband Justin Bieber.
Aside from working with Bieber and Jenner, the pro has polished the nails of Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, Adele, Mindy Kaling, and more, often adding standout embellishments and bold designs.
We can’t wait to see how many stars follow suit.
