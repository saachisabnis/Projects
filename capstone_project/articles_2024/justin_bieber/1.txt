Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) only has one bun in the oven, according to Justin Bieber’s mom, Pattie Mallette.
Mallette, 49, sparked confusion online after taking to the comments section of Stephen Baldwin’s Instagram post celebrating the couple’s pregnancy news on Thursday, May 9. “Congratulations Grandpa!” she wrote. “WE ARE GONNA HAVE THE CUTEST GRAND-BABIES EVER!”
When some fans assumed Mallette’s comment indicated that more than one Bieber baby is on the way, she quickly cleared the air.
“No not twins lol I wish,” she wrote. “Hopefully they will have more than one eventually. They will make beautiful babies whenever they have them. One is enough for now 😂.”
Stephen’s post featured a Bible verse written over a black-and-white photo of Hailey, 27, and Justin, 30. “Love you guys ❤️ blessed beyond words🙏🏼 praise God 👶🏼let’s get ready to have some fun y’all🎉,” Stephen, 57, captioned the sweet pic.
Mallette previously shared her excitement for her son and daughter-in-law in an Instagram video, gushing, “So I have been waiting for this day and now that they have shared it, I can finally celebrate with y’all. Oh my gosh, I’m going to be a grandma. Oh my goodness! Justin and Hailey you are going to be the best parents ever and I am so excited. Oh my goodness. Praise God.”
In the post’s caption, Mallette wrote, “BABY BIEBER IS ON THE WAY!! I’m gonna be a GRANDMA!!🎉🙌CONGRATULATIONS @justinbieber and @haileybieber !! My heart is so full. What an exciting new adventure. Love you so much!”
Justin and Hailey, who have been married since 2018, announced via Instagram on Thursday that they are expanding their family. The twosome shared photos and videos of Hailey showing off her baby bump while renewing their vows in Hawaii.
For their big day, Hailey sported a stunning white off-the-shoulder dress from Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello with long sleeves. She completed the look with a matching white lace veil, black sunglasses and a gold watch. Justin, for his part, wore a fuzzy coat, white T-shirt, black pants and a backward baseball cap to commemorate the occasion.
Several of the couple’s celebrity friends sent well-wishes via social media, including Kendall Jenner. “Ahhh here come the tears again,” she commented on the duo’s announcement post, while Ayesha Curry commented, “Yay yay yay!!!!!! Congratulations.”
