Hailey Bieber recently welcomed her first child with husband Justin Bieber, and even more recently welcomed her first mom jewelry: a necklace with her son’s initials.
In her first Instagram post of the month, Bieber celebrated her new chapter, writing, “It’s October and I’m someone’s Mom. 🎃” In between memes and ads for her various face serums, she showed off her new bling, which reads “jbb” (for Jack Blues Bieber, her son) in lowercase letters similar to the “B” necklace she’s worn for a while.
Does it look a little like it says “ddL” in a mirror selfie? It does. But Hailey Bieber knows that it’s a tribute to her newborn, and that’s what matters.
In the same post, she also revealed the Jack-themed accessory her husband got: a baseball cap with “Jack Blues” embroidered on the back in blue script.
The new parents revealed that Jack had arrived on August 24, with Justin writing “Welcome home” in the caption of an Instagram showing the baby’s tiny foot and Hailey’s hand.
Hailey first revealed her pregnancy back in May. “I was honestly able to keep it quiet because I stayed small for a long time. I didn’t have a belly, really, until I was six months pregnant, which is when I announced it. I was able to wear big jackets and stuff,” she told ABC News in July. “I probably could have hid it until the end, but I didn’t enjoy the stress of not being able to enjoy my pregnancy outwardly. I felt like I was hiding this big secret, and it didn’t feel good. I wanted the freedom to go out and live my life.”
Since then, Bieber has been sporting dark blue nails, perhaps a nod to her son’s middle name. Which she won’t have to do anymore, now that she’s got the necklace.
