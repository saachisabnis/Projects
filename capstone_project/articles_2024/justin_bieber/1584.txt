Last night, The Bobby Bones Show accepted their CMA Award for National Daily Broadcast Personality of the Year at the CMA Awards.
This is not the show's first night accepting such a prestigious award. They've been lucky to have several awards from CMAs and have been able to attend for many years. Normally, the entire show is all dressed up for the occasion given the dress code is formal/black-tie. However, when Lunchbox showed up yesterday, he was wearing a nicer hoodie and black jeans. It was a very controversial outfit and several people in the studio asked him why he was wearing it rather than a suit. He stuck out amongst everyone on the show because everyone else was dressed very formally, including the other people in attendance for the show. 
Lunchbox was mad that people gave him a hard time for the hoodie, and he thinks he should get to wear whatever he wants like Justin Bieber or Jelly Roll.
