Alexis Ohanian, the entrepreneur husband of tennis great Serena Williams, has revealed he surprisingly contracted Lyme disease.
The 41-year-old Reddit co-founder shared the news in a health update on social media Tuesday.
“Doing a full battery of health scans, tests, etc, and found out I have Lyme disease,” he wrote on X. “Wild. No symptoms, thankfully, but gonna treat. Good cholesterol is too low. Bad cholesterol is just OK. Gotta work on that.”
“I’ve got a loved one who had it a few years back, showed tons [of] symptoms etc and just couldn’t figure it out until they tested him for it,” Ohanian added. “I spend so little time in the wilderness/northeast this was quite a surprise.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lyme disease is caused by ​bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. It appears to be more prevalent in the northeast than in other parts of the country.
Symptoms can include a skin rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. Left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat and arthritis.
Across the country, approximately 476,000 people may be diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year.
Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, Amy Schumer and Bella Hadid are among some of the celebrities who previously disclosed their diagnoses.
“Anyway, gonna grab some antibiotics — can’t keep me down, tick!” concluded Ohanian, who shares two daughters with Williams.
