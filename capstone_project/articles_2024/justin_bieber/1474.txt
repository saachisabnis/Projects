Oscar-nominated actor Steven Yeun was set to make his MCU debut in 2025's Thunderbolts, but that won't happen. Yeun has dropped out of the film due to a scheduling conflict, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Marvel never officially announced that Yeun would be in Thunderbolts, but press reports stated he would play Sentry in the film.
Thunderbolts was originally set to come to theaters in July 2024 but it was delayed to July 2025 due to the Hollywood writer and actors' strikes in 2023. These strikes led to production delays, and as a result, Yeun is no longer available to star in Thunderbolts.
The cast for Thunderbolts includes Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Sebastian Stan, and Wyatt Russell. Thunderbolts has yet to begin filming.
Jake Schreier, who is known for directing music videos from Kanye West and Justin Bieber as well as the movie Paper Towns, is directing Thunderbolts.
Thunderbolts wouldn't have been Yeun's first comic book project, as he already voiced Invincible in the animated show of the same name for Prime Video from Robert Kirkman. Yeun also starred on AMC's The Walking Dead. He earned an Academy Award nomination for the movie Minari.
Marvel has just one new movie set for release this year--Deadpool 3. The floodgates will open again in 2025 with the release of Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, and then Blade.
