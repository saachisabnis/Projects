An interview with Justin Bieber is going viral as the singer opened up about his feelings for Billie Eilish.
The heartfelt footage comes from a sit-down chat with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Apple Music's broadcasting platform, where Biebs was promoting his latest tunes from the album 'Changes'.
During the chat, Zane asked Justin about his bond with Billie Eilish, who had always been a massive Belieber and famously lost her cool when they crossed paths at Coachella in 2019.

When quizzed whether he felt a sense of guardianship over the then-rising starlet, Justin confessed: "Yeah, I definitely feel protective of her."
He delved into his own rough ride, sharing how challenging it was to navigate fame at such a tender age, surrounded by fair-weather friends declaring their love one minute and deserting him the next.
Visibly moved and struggling to hold back tears, the pop sensation revealed his supportive stance towards Billie: "I just kind of let her do her thing and if she ever needs me I'm going to be here for her."
He spoke earnestly: "I just want to protect her. I don't want her to lose it. I don't want her to go through anything I went through," making his intentions clear. "I don't wish that upon anybody. So yeah, if she ever needs me, I'm just a call away."
After shooting to the limelight at a young age, Bieber has weathered a whole heap of storms, including run-ins with the law for DUI and vandalism, not to mention candidly addressing his battles with depression and anxiety amid his rise to fame.
The chat with Zane isn't the only Justin video that's been making waves online. A throwback clip of Justin hanging out with Diddy has also resurfaced on social media. In the video, a young 15 year old Bieber and a 40 year old Diddy are seen addressing the camera, as Diddy teases their upcoming plans.
"He's having forty-eight hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose, but it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream," he revealed in the clip. The music mogul later added: "I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next forty-eight hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy."
