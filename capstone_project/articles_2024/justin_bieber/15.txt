Hailey Bieber isn’t holding back when it comes to satisfying her pregnancy cravings, and she’s not afraid to share the details with her fans. The 27-year-old model and Rhode Skin founder, who recently announced her pregnancy with husband Justin Bieber, took to social media to give a glimpse into her culinary adventures.
In an Instagram story posted on Wednesday, Hailey revealed her latest snack obsession: “egg salad on top of a pickle with hot sauce.” And she made it clear from the get-go—no judgment allowed!
With a photo showcasing her unconventional snack choice, Hailey playfully warned her followers not to raise any eyebrows. “And no, you’re not allowed to judge,” she stated jokingly. After all, pregnancy cravings can be pretty specific, and Hailey’s combination of flavors might seem unusual to some—but hey, to each their own!
Hailey’s openness about her pregnancy journey adds a relatable touch to her celebrity status. Instead of keeping her cravings under wraps, she’s inviting her fans to join in on the fun and perhaps even try out her unique snack combo for themselves.
