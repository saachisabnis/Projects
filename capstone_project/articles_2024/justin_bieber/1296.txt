A tiny seashell bikini, full scuba gear, and … bunny ears?
Physically, we may be braving January’s single-digit temperatures and blankets of snow—but mentally, we’re on a sunny island with Hailey Bieber.
The beauty mogul took to Instagram on Friday to share snaps from her Rhode 2024 calendar shoot, and the photos will have you longing for sandy beaches and tropical waters.
In the cover image, Bieber looks sun-kissed and breathtakingly beautiful in a teeny-tiny white seashell bikini under a sheer bright pink bolero top with frilly details all along the hem. She accented the minimal outfit with a chunky gold ring, small gold hoops, and a chain necklace featuring two gold medallion charms. Fittingly, the model styled her locks in a wet-hair look, and wore gorgeous, dewy makeup with a rosy blush and glossy, plump lips, while showcasing her summer freckles.
In another snap, Bieber glistens in the sun in full traffic-stopping yellow scuba gear and a black backless, one-piece swimsuit with white details along the hemline and straps. She turned up the heat even more with a black-and-white shot in which she is photographed from the back, sitting on the beach covered in sand, wearing an itty-bitty backless thong one-piece and some unexpected headwear—oversize, fluffy white bunny ears secured with a large chinstrap. Three close-ups in the carousel put her glowy, smooth skin on display: a black-and-white flick of Bieber wearing the unusual headpiece, another in which she stands under a shower, and the last showing her looking off to the side with her hair wrapped up in a towel.
“@rhode Calendar 2024 ✨💛 Pineapple Refresh Cleanser arrives 1/25 9am pst 🛁🫧,” she captioned the post. 
Bieber received droves of support for the launch, including a boost from longtime friend Kylie Jenner. Jenner posted a photo of the yellow Rhode package, which contained a large white bath bomb with the brand name inscribed on it, holding the new cleanser inside, along with the calendar. Beside the box was another package, this one from Justin Bieber’s line Drew House, which included yellow house slippers and a folded yellow, blue, black, and white shirt.
“Gifts from the biebers?! It’s a good day,” Jenner wrote.
The Kylie Cosmetics founder showed further support by sharing a second pic of Bieber’s calendar and simply writing, “hot @haileybieber.”
