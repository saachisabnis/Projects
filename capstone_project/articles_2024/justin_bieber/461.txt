The heart wants what it wants.
Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are engaged, she announced on Instagram Wednesday night.
“forever begins now,” the “Emilia Pérez” star captioned a carousel of photos showing off her diamond sparkler.
One picture captured Gomez beaming while sitting on a picnic blanket happily staring at her ring. 
In another, she and Blanco cuddled up for a sweet embrace as he gave her a kiss on the head.
The music producer also commented on her post, “hey wait… that’s my wife.”
Gomez, 32, originally sparked engagement rumors back in August when she posted a photo of herself posing in front of a mirror, but placed two very strategic hearts over her left ring finger.
Blanco, 36, for his part, also appeared in the image but was not facing the camera.
“She’s covering her finger!! Are they….,” one fan wondered, while another more confidently said, “She’s def engaged 😭💍.”
The “Love You Like a Love Song” singer and the music producer have been dating for more than a year.
In December 2023, Gomez confirmed speculation online that she and Blanco were a couple, and also revealed at the time that they had secretly been an item for six months.
Fans had mixed reactions to the relationship announcement, with some calling out how the songwriter had previously worked and been friends with Gomez’s ex Justin Bieber. 
However, the “Love On” songstress fiercely defended her decision to date Blanco.
Gomez wrote on social media at the time that the record producer was “the best thing that’s ever happened” to her, adding, “He’s still better than anyone I’ve ever been with. Facts.”
The couple’s inner circles have reportedly backed their romance as well.
“Their friends, family and loved ones on both sides are all supportive and happy to see what they think could be an amazing and long-lasting relationship between the two of them,” an insider told Entertainment Tonight in January.
“Benny finds Selena to be brilliant beyond belief. He thinks she is extremely talented, genuine, sweet and intelligent.”
Gomez and Blanco were friends and collaborators long before they became romantically involved.
The producer even made an appearance with her in the “I Can’t Get Enough” music video in 2019, wearing a giant teddy bear costume.
Blanco made a call-back to that memory in a July Instagram post, writing, “i used to play a teddy bear in ur music video and now i get to b urs in real life… happy bday bb ! i love u !”
Some fans of Gomez — who were admittedly not supportive of the relationship at first — have turned over a new leaf after seeing how happy Blanco has made her.
“okay benny, you win, i surrender! thanks for making her happy, thats what matter most to us! 💗,” one person commented under his July 22 post.
Another added, “It’s so good to know that someone is really making Selena happy! Thanks, Benny, for doing this.”
It’s unclear when exactly Gomez and Blanco will walk down the aisle, but they already have plans to start a family in the future.
“It’s always a topic of conversation to me every day,” Blanco said when asked about having kids on “The Howard Stern Show” in May.
“That’s my next goal, to check the box. I have a ton of godkids; I’ve got a ton of nephews. I love being around kids.”
In September, Gomez also spoke about the prospect of motherhood with Vanity Fair, revealing that even though she “can’t carry [her] own children” due to medical issues, she’s considering surrogacy or adoption.
