The list of Minnesota State Fair Grandstand performances for the 2024 Great Minnesota Get-Together continues to grow as organizers announce the 5th act for this year's fair.
The freshest addition is Grammy Award-winning rapper and singer Chance the Rapper, who will be making his second appearance at the Minnesota State Fair. Chance the Rapper was last at the Grandstand as an opening act for Macklemore back in 2013, but this time he will be heading the show.
Chance has a new album coming out this spring called “Star Line Gallery”, which is sure to be a big part of his performance at the State Fair later this year.
Chance the Rapper has built a notable music career with several mixtapes, a studio album, and a deep list of collaborations with massive names in the music world that include the likes of Justin Bieber, John Legend, DJ Khaled, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Wayne, and Ed Sheeran.
Besides making music, Chance the Rapper has also been getting more deeply involved in television and movies, being involved with a number of productions including as a coach on NBC's The Voice.
Chance the Rapper will be hitting the stage at the Minnesota State Fair Grandstand on Friday, August 23, 2024, at 7:00 pm. Tickets go on sale for this show on Friday, March 15 at 10 am via the Minnesota State Fair website, with prices ranging between $48 and $148.
Chance the Rapper joins the growing roster of performers for this year's State Fair Grandstand which also includes Motley Crue, comedian Nate Bargatze, Kidz Bop Live, and the Happy Together Tour featuring throwback acts from the 1960s and 1970s like The Turtles, Jay and the Americans, Badfinger, The Vogues, and The Association.
