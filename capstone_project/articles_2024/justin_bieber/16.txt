New mom Hailey Bieber—who welcomed son Jack Blues Bieber Aug. 22 with husband Justin Bieber—proved she’s taking parenthood in stride as she added a must-have baby item to her handbag.
Hailey Bieber is embracing motherhood.
Weeks after giving birth to son Jack Blues Bieber—her first child with husband Justin Bieber—the model gave a subtle nod to her new role as she unveiled her essential items for fall.
In a post shared on her Rhode skincare line’s Instagram page Oct. 2, one photo showed a series of items falling from the 27-year-old’s handbag, which is inscribed with her son’s initials, “JBB.” Along with must-have items like a hairbrush, narrow-framed sunglasses, a smartphone and various Rhode products, the new mom had also added a baby bottle to her bag.
Hailey celebrated being a parent on her personal Instagram page as well, posting a photo dump Oct. 1 with the understated caption, “It’s October and I’m someone’s Mom.”
The couple—who married at a New York City courthouse in 2018 before throwing a lavish wedding ceremony one year later—announced baby Jack’s arrival on social media Aug. 23 with a photo of Hailey’s finger grazing the newborn’s foot. In the caption, the “Sorry” singer wrote, “WELCOME HOME.”
And the little guy is already surrounded by love—just ask his grandparents. Shortly after Jack’s birth, Hailey’s father, Stephen Baldwin, couldn’t help but gush about the newest addition to the family.
“He’s just—I don’t want to say too much—he’s unbelievably cute,” the actor told People in September. “And the world will see him soon.”

Similarly, Justin’s mom, first-time grandma Pattie Mallette, shared her excitement about the baby in an Instagram Story post with a clip of Molly Shannon as Helen Madden on Saturday Night Live. In the clip, the character exclaimed, “I love it, I love it, I LOVE it! I love it! I love it! I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it! I love itttttttt! Every second of it, every second of it—I love it.”
Pattie added her own caption to the clip, writing, “First time Grandma's be like!”
