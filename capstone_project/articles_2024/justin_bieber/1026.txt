Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey Bieber, shared a tender moment during Coachella’s opening night on Friday as they watched Lana Del Ray perform.
The pair — who has been subjected to divorce rumors for months — was filmed looking as in love as ever as they snuggled up to each other.
The “Sorry” hitmaker was also seen rubbing the model’s head before planting a kiss on her forehead. 
Earlier in the day, Justin, 30, was spotted walking by himself while Hailey, 27, was busy promoting her Rhode skincare line at a booth, but they met up later in the evening to enjoy the musical acts together.
Their loved-up display at the 2024 Coachella contrasted their appearance last year, when Hailey appeared to comfort a seemingly unwell Justin with back rubs.
The couple — who wed in 2018 — has been fighting off concerns about their relationship for some time.
In February, Hailey’s father, Stephen Baldwin, shared a video from Victor Marx, the founder of All Things Possible Ministries, asking fans to keep the couple in their prayers. 
“Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord,” a message over a clip of Justin performing read.
Hailey and Justin were then photographed looking somber as they arrived at church in Beverly Hills, Calif., which further fueled the rumor mill.
However, in March, Hailey took it upon herself to slam accounts promoting “blind items” about her marriage. 
She wrote via her Instagram Story at the time, “Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong. Made out of thin air… come from the land of delusion.”
“So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they’re always false xx sorry to spoil it,” she added.
Hailey also seemingly clapped back against rumors that she and Justin were on the rocks by sharing a sentimental tribute for her husband on his 30th birthday.
“words could never truly describe the beauty of who you are,” she sweetly penned on March 1. “Happy Birthday to you… love of my life, for life. 🤍.”

Earlier this month, a source close to the couple also denied that they’re divorcing.
“There’s no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever,” the person told People before insisting, “They are very, very happy.”
