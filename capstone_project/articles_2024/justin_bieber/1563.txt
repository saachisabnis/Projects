Hailey and Justin Bieber just enjoyed their first Thanksgiving as a family of three.
The new mom gave fans a look into her November, along with a rare glimpse of her three-month-old son Jack Blues, whom she shares with Justin. In the Instagram post shared on Friday, November 29, the first photo – a candid selfie – Hailey, 28, holds baby Jack while Justin, 30, stands next to her. She captioned the photos, "November, aka the best month of the year."
The selfie showed the couple dressed in cozy fur coats, with Jack strapped to Hailey's chest – Justin barely visible as he hid in his large hood. The socialite also kept herself incognito in a pair of sunglasses and baseball hat. The following images highlighted the rest of the Rhode founder's month, including glimpses of her beauty products, cinnamon rolls, and a few playful mirror selfies.
Fans loved seeing the little peek of Jack in the photos.
"I wasn't expecting a pic like the first one today 🥹❤️," said one fan account.
"Thank you for this photo Hailey, you're amazing , love you 🥹😭🤍," another user commented, while a third fan stated, "the most beautiful family in the world."
Hailey last shared a photo of her son on her Instagram feed back on November 1 when she shared a similar recap style post of her October. This time, the carousel featured a photo of the model and the "Stay" singer's Halloween costumes. The Bieber's went as the animated series Kim Possible — Justin as Ron Stoppable, Hailey as Kim, and Jack as Rufus, their naked mole rat companion.
The couple have kept a relatively low profile since welcoming their son in August, which has been a big adjustment. According to a source from People who is close to the couple, "They've been trying to stay as low-key as they can since Jack arrived." The source also revealed to the outlet that while they are thrilled about their new arrival, the transition to parenthood has come with its challenges. "They're very excited but becoming parents and having a newborn has been a big adjustment for them. They've had a lot of support," the source shared.
Hailey and Justin have been married since 2018.
