Justin and Hailey Bieber were seen attending a late-night church service together just hours after her dad Stephen Baldwin shared a cryptic message asking the public for prayers for the couple’s marriage.
The model and the popstar were photographed arriving for church in Los Angeles on Wednesday night (February 28)  in their new $90,000 Tesla Cybertruck.
The lovebirds, who tied the knot in 2018, had a somber appearance as they arrived at Churchome Church at Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills.
The 27-year-old Rhode skincare founder was spotted wearing a vibrant yellow argyle sweater paired with baggy jeans, sunglasses, and a black purse.

Meanwhile, Justin rocked a Kanyesque look, showing up to church with nearly all of his face covered by an oversized hoodie and a black scarf.
Born into devout Christian homes, the couple has spoken about their faith on several occasions. 
During one of her “A Conversation With” segments on YouTube, Hailey said that her and the Canadian singer’s faith is “the biggest thing” that grounds their relationship. “If we didn’t have that, we wouldn’t even be here. We wouldn’t even be together.”
Recently, a post that the model’s father, Stephen Baldwin, shared about her marriage raised concerns among fans.

The 57-year-old Usual Suspects star re-posted a video from Victor Marx, founder of All Things Possible Ministries, that showed Justin playing the guitar and singing along to “I Could Sing of Your Love Forever.”
The video’s caption reads, “Christians please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection, and draw close to the Lord.”
Victor added in the caption that his wife, Eileen Marx, and Hailey’s mom, Kennya Baldwin, “often pray together” for the couple.
“There are special challenges that folks in high visibility positions face and also the enemy doesn’t want them to draw closer to Jesus,” he wrote.

Hailey didn’t seem to appreciate her father interfering with her private life and exposing her problems for the world to see.
Sources close to the model told TMZ that Hailey is reportedly “pissed” at Stephen for urging the public to pray for her and Justin.
According to the outlet, the young couple is currently going through a “private” family matter, which Stephen knew about.
It was actually the actor and filmmaker who played Cupid back in 2009 when he introduced his then-teenage daughter to Justin backstage on NBC’s Today Show.
“Nice to meet you,” were the first words Hailey ever said to Justin. The pair eventually began dating in 2015, and reignited their on-and-off relationship in 2018.
Justin, who has just turned 30, has maintained a lower profile since 2022, when he canceled his Justice World Tour due to his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 
Describing the condition, he said that it’s “from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis.”
“As the result of this illness, I was not able to complete the North America leg of the Justice Tour,” the Peaches singer posted to Instagram stories at the time.
“I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I’m going to take a break from touring for the time being. I’m going to be ok, but I need time to rest and get better.”
Justin returned to the stage at the NHL All-Star Player draft in Toronto on February 1, delighting his fans with a medley of his hits.

The Rhode founder has also struggled with health problems in recent years. In March 2022, Hailey announced that she suffered a blood clot to her brain.
“Although this was definitely one of the scariest moments I’ve ever been through, I’m home now and doing well,” the model shared on her Instagram Story at the time. 
“And I’m so grateful and thankful to all the amazing doctors and nurses who took care of me! Thank you to everyone who has reached out with well wishes and concern, and for all the support and love.”

The Biebers used to go to Hillsong, a "cool" xtian church until some of its pastors were caught in scandals. Now they are going to a new "cool" church, as if anyone cares. Anyone is free to worship at the religious institution of their choice, but do we have to hear about it?
Crowd-sourcing prayers for people who literally have the world at their feet is beyond reprehensible. This was just an attempt for Stephen to get attention. What a pathetic loser
