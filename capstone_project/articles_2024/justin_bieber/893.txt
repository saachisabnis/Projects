GOODYEAR, Ariz. — The oldest member of the Cleveland Guardians’ roster — a former Cy Young Award candidate and a veteran pitcher with October experience — started the team’s spring opener Saturday.
For someone with Carlos Carrasco’s credentials, the assignment should barely have boosted his heart rate. And yet …
“I was so, so, so nervous,” Carrasco said Saturday after a scoreless first inning against the Cincinnati Reds at Goodyear Ballpark.

Carrasco will turn 37 next month — “Don’t say that! Yeah, yeah. It will be 37,” he said — but retirement never crossed his mind over the winter, even after a miserable 2023 season in which he logged a 6.80 ERA for the New York Mets.
He wants to pitch until he’s 40, as long as his body will permit. He watched Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer sling fastballs in New York even as gray hairs infiltrated their beards. A 2 1/2-week stint at Driveline’s pitching lab in Scottsdale this offseason convinced Carrasco that, with a couple of tweaks to clean up his delivery, he can follow a similar path.
There was no question Cleveland would be the location for him to pursue it.
Carrasco and the Guardians started talking about a reunion in December, though Carrasco voiced his interest in a homecoming last season after pitching against the Guardians at Citi Field. The sides capped their discourse in late January with a minor-league deal, an invite to big-league camp and a familiar locker in the back corner of the team’s Arizona complex.
“It was really simple,” Carrasco said. “I just wanted to come back here.”
“We were almost in tears in the meeting,” team president Chris Antonetti said.
“He puts a smile on your face every day,” pitching coach Carl Willis said.
Willis has witnessed Carrasco at his peaks and valleys: as a rookie facing the pressure of being traded for a reigning Cy Young Award winner, as a proficient workhorse who gobbled up innings and piled up strikeouts, and as an inspiration who so desperately wanted to preserve any shred of normalcy during his bout with leukemia in 2019 that he kept throwing bullpen sessions despite extreme fatigue. They shed tears together that summer, then shared smiles when Carrasco returned to the mound Sept. 1 of that season, 10 years to the day of his major-league debut.
“What he persevered through,” Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said, “you can’t say enough about.”
"I got my first real six-string…"

Those experiences help to explain why it was so meaningful to Carrasco to return to the organization after three years with the Mets. It’s not just about the past, though. It’s about what Carrasco has left to offer.
“Cleveland is the best place for him,” Willis said, “to get everything out of himself he can get and be comfortable doing it.”

Carrasco’s fastball was clocked in the low 90s on Saturday, though given his jitters, he wasn’t reading too much into the radar gun reports. He said his velocity has been up a few ticks from where it has typically sat in recent springs.
“When you feel like you still have something in the tank, why stop?” said Vogt, who is only two years older than Carrasco. “You love to play. Clearly, his family is supportive of it. I think people retire or move on for various reasons, but without speaking for Carlos, he knows he can still do it, and he believes his stuff is still really good.
“It’s about competition. It’s about seeing what you can push yourself to do. I think there’s an element to that — when you know you can still contribute to a team winning, you want to keep going. You only get to do this once. It’s not as easy as just saying, ‘OK, that was fun for the last 30 years of my life. Let me just move on.’ I think Carlos still has a lot left in the tank.”
Carrasco scanned the Guardians’ clubhouse one day last week and counted how many teammates’ tenures stretched back to his last stint with the team. José Ramírez. Shane Bieber. James Karinchak. Brief dances with Triston McKenzie, Austin Hedges and Josh Naylor in 2020. That’s it.
For 11 years, Carrasco was a staple in Cleveland, a linchpin in the league’s most dominant rotation. He recently reflected on his first year in the organization, when he sought guidance from Kerry Wood, Aaron Laffey and Jake Westbrook.
He remembers Kelly Shoppach catching his debut, a day full of nerves for a vital piece of a signature trade.
And 5,290 days later, those butterflies resurfaced as Carrasco walked in his navy uniform top and red cap to the center of the infield, a circle of dirt he has paced across countless times. He said he was so nervous, he couldn’t feel the baseball in his hand.
“As soon as I got to that mound,” Carrasco said, “I had a lot of feelings.”
So did those watching him.
“To have him take the ball right out of the gate,” Vogt said, “it just looked right and felt right.”
