NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — Men who went by nicknames like “Justin Bieber” and “Ninja” are accused of running a major gas pump skimming operation that stretched to the Hampton Roads area.
The seven suspects, all from the Miami area, have been charged with racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in the case. The federal indictment went through the Eastern District of Virginia, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.
The DOJ says from 2014 to April 2024, the men installed skimming devices on gas pumps throughout the United States, including in Hampton Roads and on the Eastern Shore. They note the Norfolk Police Department, Northampton County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI’s Norfolk field office were all involved in the investigation.
The DOJ says the suspects would then use the stolen card data obtained through the skimming to create fraudulent credit and debit cards. They’d use those cards to make ATM withdrawals, purchase gift cards and electronic, and make cashback purchases from stores.
“The defendants also allegedly engaged in acts involving access device fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, interstate transportation of stolen goods, and the sale and receipt of stolen goods,” prosecutors said in a release.
The leader of the operation was 40-year-old Eduardo Rodriguez, of Fort Myers, prosecutors say. The other suspects are listed below:
Idalberto Rivero, also known as El Monstro, El Mostro, and Monster, 53, of Miami
Anyelo Jesus Muino Ayala, also known as Justin Bieber, 26, of Miami
Pedro Raul Zequeira Alvarez, also known as Yery Yery, 33, of Miami
Raul Ferrao Pons, also known as Rauli and Ninja, 32, of Miami
Jorge Enrique Fonseca Vazquez, also known as Ogberoso, 32, of Miami
Luis Gustavo Diaz, also known as Ogberdi, 39, of Miami
If convicted, the defendants could face up to 20 years in prison on each count.
