She’s spreading her wings.
Hailey Bieber showed off her baby bump in new photos on Instagram Wednesday, gushing over her “past few weeks.” 
The model, who is pregnant with her and husband Justin Bieber’s first child, posed outdoors during golden hour in a backless, bedazzled Blumarine butterfly top ($690) covered with sequins and beadwork.
She styled the Y2K-inspired tank with baggy, low-slung denim, a gold Rolex and, of course, her stunning oval-cut engagement ring from Justin.
In another snap, Hailey kicked back with a coffee, clad in a white T-shirt hitched up to expose her bump and a Kids Worldwide cap ($45) embroidered with the word “happy.”
And a third snap saw the star modeling denim overalls and a vintage Fila hat.
“The past few weeks have been 🐣✨🤍🌴😴💤🌸🌸🌅🥹🥹🥹🥹,” Hailey captioned the photo dump. 
On May 9, the Biebers revealed they were expecting their first child together.
They shared the exciting news in a slew of Instagram photos from their vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii, with Hailey donning a white lace Saint Laurent dress and matching veil for the occasion.
She caressed her bump while posing with Justin, 30, who kept it casual in a bomber jacket, black jeans and a baseball cap.
The Victoria’s Secret model is reportedly six months pregnant, which means baby Bieber may arrive by the end of the summer.
While the couple, who wed in 2018, have stayed under the radar for the past few months, they were spotted walking around Los Angeles on Tuesday.
Hailey opted for another bump-framing ‘fit for the outing, pairing an oversized black Balenciaga blazer and matching Wardrobe.NYC x Hailey Bieber trousers ($900) with a cropped baby tee.
The “Peaches” crooner kept it casual in a vintage REM T-shirt, lime green basketball pants and a beanie.
