 Hailey Bieber is celebrating Christmas in style!

 On Christmas Eve — Tuesday, Dec. 24 — the Rhode founder, 28, gave her fans and fellow makeup gurus a glimpse into her simple holiday makeup routine in a TikTok video.

 Setting the short video to Wham!'s "Last Christmas," Hailey began her routine by applying blush from the Pocket Blush collection of her makeup line to her cheeks, giving them a rosy, wintry glow and blending the cream out using a brush.

 Next, the mom of one switched brands and pulled out a compact of glittering Fenty highlighter — but instead of applying it to her cheekbones, she opted to use the product as eyeshadow, liberally applying it to her lids with a fluffy brush.

 Moving on to her lips, Hailey pulled out the just-revealed Rhode lip liner — which isn't available for purchase yet, though the former model teased the product in another TikTok posted last week — and liberally lined her lips with a pinkish-brown color. Finishing it all off, she added a pink hue to her lips using the creamy Rhode blush product.

 Several celebs shared their love for the simple-yet-festive look in her comments section. Singer Tate McRae chimed in to write: "Yes pls," while Madison Beer wrote simply: "beauty."

 Separately on her Instagram Stories, Hailey showed off her Christmas breakfast (jammy eggs with caviar), along with her holiday look — a cozy pajama set that featured blue striped shorts and matching slippers.

 The model's husband Justin Bieber, 30, showed some alternative footage of the pair's Christmas celebrations, posting a peek at their festivities to his Instagram account on Wednesday, Dec. 25.

 In the post, Justin shared a selfie of his own look, which featured a fur hat, shiny wraparound sunglasses and a tweed coat with a cream sweater underneath.

 The Instagram post also featured some photos taken at a snowy outdoor location and a blurry picture of multiple Christmas trees strung up to the ceiling of a house.

 This marks the couple's first Christmas together since welcoming their son Jack, who was born on Aug. 23. Just last week, Hailey shared another style update that included a special nod to her baby's birthday.

 In a photo posted to her Instagram Stories, she showed off a glittering ring displayed on her right hand from Ring Concierge that featured a pair green and yellow gemstones, which she labeled on the photo as “Jack” and “Mama," respectively.

 “@haileybieber wearing her Ring Concierge Toi et Moi Personalized Gemstone Ring, a stone to represent mom and baby. 🫶🏼,” the brand wrote in their own post on their Instagram page on Dec. 22.

 With Jack’s zodiac sign being Virgo, the left gem on the ring appears to be a square-cut peridot — a birthstone associated with the sign. The pear-shaped “Mama” stone appears to be a topaz to match Hailey's birthday month of November.

 After Jack's birth this summer, a source exclusively told PEOPLE that Justin was "already a great dad."

 "The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for. The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant was the best ever for Justin," the source added. "He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them.”

 The source also said that Hailey and Justin were "both overjoyed" after welcoming their son, telling PEOPLE, "The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well. Hailey's doing well too."
