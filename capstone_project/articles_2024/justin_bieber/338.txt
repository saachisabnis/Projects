	Forget maternity swimsuits — Hailey Bieber is enjoying summer in a teeny tiny black bikini instead. (That’s one way to make sure the bump fits!) Justin Bieber shared a new photo of his wife in her stunning swimsuit as they shared a steamy kiss on a boat, and it shows just how sexy pregnancy can be!

	The “Peaches” singer shared several photos on Instagram on Tuesday, including the PDA moment with Hailey. She wore a black bikini top and tiny black bottoms with a crochet bucket hat as she hung out on a boat with beautiful trees in the background. Justin leans over to give her a smooch, dressed in a backward cap, lifejacket, and bandana-print board shorts. His hand is resting protectively over her baby bump (and scandalously lower too!). This couple is turning up the heat in here!

	The Biebers seem to be spending some much-needed downtime on the water after a busy weekend in New York City. They went to lunch at Sadelle’s on Saturday, where Hailey looked gorgeous in a black, one-shoulder top and pants with a Bottega Veneta bag, per Page Six. That evening, she changed into a sheer black lace Alessandra Rich jumpsuit with heels and a black trench coat.



	When they went to Hailey’s Rhodes pop-up store on Sunday night, the Rhodes founder changed into a form-fitting beige LaQuan Smith dress with a matching oversized blazer. Before leaving the city, she changed into a Phoebe Philo turtleneck dress in cream with matching heels to go out to dinner. Justin, meanwhile, opted for more casual outfits the entire time. (Page Six has photos of all their outfits HERE.)

	Hailey posted more pictures of her beige dress at the Rhodes pop-up on Instagram, which received tons of love from other celebrity moms. “sooo cute,” Kylie Jenner wrote. Paris Hilton left a “🩷” and Gigi Hadid said, “🥹🥹🥲.”



	From designer looks to tiny bikinis, Hailey’s pregnancy style is amazing!
These stunning maternity photos capture the beauty, excitement, and power of pregnancy.
