Actress Florence Pugh has posted a video from the set of Marvel's next big movie, Thunderbolts, revealing a behind-the-scenes look at the superhero film.
This wasn't some sneaky, unsanctioned video, though--it was posted on Instagram with Marvel tagged as the co-contributor. It's clearly a promotional video for the film meant to generate hype, and it certainly does that, while also providing a rare look at what the sets of Marvel's movies actually look like. Take a look at the walkthrough video below to get a glimpse.

Due out in theaters in May 2025, Thunderbolts follows a team of superheroes recruited by the government for an important mission. Pugh returns to play Yelena Belove, with David Harbour coming back as well to reprise his role as Alexei. The movie also brings back Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, with Wyatt Russell playing John Walker and Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.
Jake Schreier, who has directed music videos for Kanye West and Justin Bieber, as well as episodes of Kidding and Beef, is directing Thunderbolts.
Whereas previous years featured multiple releases, Marvel has just one new movie coming to theaters in 2024--Deadpool and Wolverine. This is part of Disney's wider strategy to release fewer, better movies.
