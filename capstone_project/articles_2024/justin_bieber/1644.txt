Hailey Bieber is enjoying the official start of the holiday season with her family.
“November aka the best month of the year 🫶🏼🍁,” Bieber wrote via Instagram on Friday, November 29, alongside a carousel of images.
The first snap featured Hailey on an outdoor stroll with husband Justin Bieber and their 3-month-old son, Jack. The Rhode founder had the little one close to her chest as she snuggled up to her furry animal print coat. While her son’s face was turned away from the camera, fans could clearly see the newborn wearing a blue hoodie to keep warm.
Hailey completed her look with a black baseball cap and sunglasses. Justin, for his part, rocked a black and white camo print jacket during the family outing. The singer, 30, kept warm by wearing a hoodie and as the pair flashed bright smiles for the camera.
In addition to the sweet family pic, Hailey posted a series of snaps featuring her hard at work with her beauty brand. She also included some cozy moments at home showing off a pan of freshly baked cinnamon rolls plus a clip of a log burning from her fireplace.
Hailey and Justin became first-time parents in August —Justin announced their son’s birth in a sweet social media post.
“WELCOME HOME,” he captioned a photo of Hailey touching Jack’s foot, which was wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. “JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻.”
Since welcoming Jack, Hailey offered fans brief glimpses of her little one as she and Justin adjusted to being a family of three. Earlier this month, Hailey showed off how Jack celebrated his first Halloween.
“October things ✅✅😌,” she penned, alongside a pic of the baby’s legs in a Halloween-themed onesie.
According to the post, for his first Spooky Season Jack rocked a Nightmare Before Christmas print outfit that included Jack Skellington, Oogie Boogie and Zero the spooky puppy.
As Hailey adapted to life as a new mom, she admitted that she was making sure she had a proper work-life balance.

“I’m only doing what feels comfortable for me physically, mentally and emotionally,” Hailey said in an October interview with Women’s Wear Daily.
Hailey confessed she considered her company — whose moniker comes from her middle name — to be her toddler. She founded the brand in June 2022. As Rhode continues to grow, Hailey opened up about the lessons she’s learned as a business owner.
“Mistakes are going to happen … [there] “will be bumps in the road, which are out of your control,” she reflected to the outlet. “But you need to pivot, run and work with them as they come.”
