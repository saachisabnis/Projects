Hailey Bieber is rocking a new ring that pays tribute to her son with husband Justin Bieber. According to US Magazine, Hailey posted a pic of her new baby bling in an Instagram Story on Saturday, revealing an image of a square-shaped lime green peridot diamond nestled next to a teardrop-shaped topaz stone on a thin gold band.

	The 28-year-old model then broke down the meaning of the stones, saying one represented “Jack” and the topaz was for her, “mama.” Hailey gave birth to son Jack Blues in August, which explains choosing the peridot, a gem derived from the common mineral olivine, one of the few gemstones that occur in only a single color that is one of the birthstones for that month.

	Back in November, Justin shared the first family photo with Jack, a Halloween snap in which all three members are dressed up for the holiday, with the proud parents wearing Ron and Kim Possible costumes and Jack dressed as Ron’s pet naked mole rat, Rufus.

	Bieber launched a world tour in February 2022 in support of most recent LP, 2021’s Justice, and his 2020 Changes album. But in June of that year, the singer revealed that he’d been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which had resulted in “full paralysis” on one side of his face, leading to the postponement of some dates. He ended up cancelling the rest of the tour to focus on his health and has been mostly off the music radar since.
