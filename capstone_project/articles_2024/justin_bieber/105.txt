RocNation artist and Sony Music Publishing songwriter and producer, DIXSON, celebrated his birthday with a speakeasy-themed event at The Spare Room in the iconic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Known for his Grammy-winning, Golden Globe, and Oscar-nominated work with Beyoncé and Kehlani, DIXSON’s party drew many elite entertainment industry figures. Guests included Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Kehlani, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Leven Kali, international DJ and producer Jae Murphy, actress Nafessa Williams, and comedian Daphnique Springs. The celebration featured bowling, luxurious cognac cocktails from D’Ussé, photo booth fun from Gif Cube, and music by DJs Trauma and Carisma.
DIXSON, acclaimed for his multi-platinum collaborations with artists like Beyoncé, Kehlani, Chance The Rapper, Justin Bieber, Rapsody, and Pharrell Williams, is preparing for his highly-anticipated full-length solo album. His previous solo EPs, Lovers and Friends and 004DAISY, have set the stage for this upcoming release.
The event, co-produced by LOOP and The Goldwing Group, offered guests $50 dining certificates to Hollywood Burger, wellness sessions from Melanin+ body sculpting, PerformH2O hydration from The Evolved Co., and limited future stays at Algodon Mansion Hotel in Buenos Aires. The Spare Room, with its vintage bowling lanes and unique atmosphere, provided the perfect setting for the celebration.
Reflecting on the occasion, DIXSON shared, “Seeing so many people I love, and who love me, filled me with intense gratitude. This felt like a preliminary celebration for finishing my new album, and I’m excited to share it with the world.”
