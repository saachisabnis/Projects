So happy for these two!  
Hailey and Justin Bieber are expecting their first child together (!!!!!) and couldn't be more excited about their “fresh start.” A source tells Us Weekly that the couple, who just renewed their wedding vows, has “gone through hard times recently” and feels like this is “the light at the end of the tunnel.”
“They are elated and so grateful they are expanding their family,” the insider says, adding that “It was everything they needed. Hailey is feeling really good. She has been laying low and trying not to overdo it with her work commitments.”
As for why the couple decided to renew their wedding vows, the person close to the sitch notes they wanted to “embrace a new chapter together” and “renew and restore their faith in God together, and in their relationship. It was a new commitment and a fresh start for them as a family of three.”
A source also told Entertainment Tonight that “Hailey is such a natural caretaker and Justin knows she will be the best mom, and Hailey has always thought that Justin will make an amazing dad. Hailey, Justin, their families, and loved ones are so excited for this beautiful blessing.”
A refresher that the pair announced their pregnancy on Instagram on May 10, with Hailey wearing a semi-sheer lace Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello dress. She paired the look with some sunglasses and a veil for a bridal vibe. So yeah, she's already the most chic mom.
