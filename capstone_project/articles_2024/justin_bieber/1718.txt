Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas have already conquered the pop charts, the Grammys, and the Oscars. So what else is there for the two award-winning young musicians to do than take part in a new episode of Hot Ones Versus? The premise for the competition is simple, with each participant either answering deeply personal questions or eating spicy wings. Whoever eats the most wings loses. 
Billie rates her past outfits, while Finneas shares what their biggest fight has been about, and reveals that “What Was I Made For?” is his favorite song of theirs. Finneas ate a wing rather than admit which musician he never wanted to work with again, while Billie refused to rank Tyler, the Creator, Lana Del Rey, Childish Gambino, and Justin Bieber from best to least talented. When complimenting each other, Eilish says Finneas is the smartest, most talented person she knows, while Finneas says of Billie, “You look good in the dumbest f*cking clothing.” (Uproxx)
