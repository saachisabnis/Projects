WASHINGTON (TND)  — Beyoncé's new song "Texas Hold 'Em" became the number one Hot Country Song Tuesday, according to Billboard.
Her other new country song, "16 Carriages" ranked No. 9 on the chart.
The debut marks her first-ever No. 1 single on the country charts and she made history as the first woman to have topped both Hot Country Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs since the lists began as all-encompassing genre song charts in October 1958, Billboard said.
Morgan Wallen, Justin Bieber, Billy Ray Cyrus and Ray Charles are the only other artists to have led both charts.
Beyoncé also joined Taylor Swift to be among the solo women with no accompanying artists to launch atop the country chart. Swift succeeded with "Love Story (Taylor’s Version)" and "All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)" in 2021.
Both "16 Carriages" and "Texas Hold 'Em" were released afterBeyoncé teased the release of new music during a Super Bowl ad for Verizon.
At the very end of the commercial, you heard her saying, "OK, they ready. Drop the new music."
Shortly after, the music was released on her official website and streaming platforms. She also announced her eighth studio album "Renaissance Act II" would be released on March 29.
