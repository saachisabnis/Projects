Hailey Bieber is reminiscing about one of the "most magical" days of her life while also honoring the legacy of a friend.
The 27-year-old Rhode founder took to her Instagram Stories on Monday (September 30) to share a couple photos of her in the stunning lace wedding gown she wore to marry Justin Bieber five years ago and to remember the life of her friend and designer Virgil Abloh on what would have also been his 44th birthday, per People. Abloh passed away November 28, 2021, following a cancer battle.
The throwback photos from August 2019 feature the model at her final dress fitting prior to her second wedding ceremony to the "Peaches" singer the following month, one year after the pair first said "I do" in a New York City courthouse wedding. The pics show off the gorgeous off-the-shoulder lace gown Abloh created for her with Off-White, complete with a long sheer veil.
"Happy Birthday V, we miss you! Thank you for making me the most magical wedding dress. ü§çü™Ω," she captioned a pic of her arm-in-arm with Abloh.
Since tying the knot, the Biebers have gone on to welcome their first child together, a son named Jack Blues Bieber born in August, a few months after the couple announced in May that they were expecting with a sweet video from an intimate vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii.
