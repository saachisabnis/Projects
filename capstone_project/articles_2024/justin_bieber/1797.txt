The top 10 countries with the most attractive people have been revealed - and it might surprise you where the UK places on the list.
A study conducted by Insider Monkey looked at stats for the most followed people on Instagram to determine which country had the most "beautiful" people in the world.
Those countries were then further studied regarding the frequency of cosmetic surgeries, facilities, and other beauty-related industries.
In 10th place is Italy, which might not come as a surprise to some. The cosmetic industry in Italy has had a billion-pound boost since pre-pandemic, with millions of sales every month.
In the Italian beauty industry, face care, body care, and perfumery products are leading categories. Ninth place is taken by Japan, with its market size expected to reach Â£28billion by 2028.
