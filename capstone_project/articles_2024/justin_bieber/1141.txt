And she has the sweetest name
Sofia Richie Grainge and Elliot Grainge are parents!
The two have welcomed their first child, a daughter. The model shared the sweet announcement via Instagram today, along with a black-and-white photo of herself and Grainge holding their baby girl’s teeny feet in their hands while the infant was wrapped in a little blanket.
“Eloise Samantha Grainge,” Richie Grainge wrote in the post caption, revealing her baby’s sweet name. “🤍5•20•24 best day of my life🤍.”
Friends of the couple quickly took to the comments to share their congratulations.
“Congratulations 🥹🥹💗💗💗,” wrote Hailey Bieber, who is currently pregnant with her and husband Justin Bieber’s first child.
“I now have a new favorite EG. sorry Elliot 🐧💕,” Richie Grainge’s sister, Nicole Richie, commented.
“Congratulations 🥰🥰🥰🥰🩷🩷,” Kylie Jenner wrote. 
Richie Grainge revealed her pregnancy in January in the most stylish way—through a series of photos of herself displaying her growing baby bump in some quietly luxurious outfits, including a deep red cape dress, a blazer with no top underneath, a black backless dress, and a button-up shirt left partly open to reveal her bump.
In one photo, Grainge makes an appearance in a matching look. “And then there were three 🤍,” Sofia captioned the photo.
The new parents, who met through their families when they were just kids, married in the French Riviera in April 2023.
