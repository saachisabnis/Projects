On Saturday, Hailey Bieber debuted her new hair color for the cooling weather in her Instagram Stories with a cute selfie. In the picture Hailey shared, she wore her new lighter locks down around her shoulders and had on a fresh faced makeup look. She had on a gray T-shirt and her shiny “B” necklace, as well as a pair of tortoise shell framed glasses.
Hailey was seated outside under an umbrella. Over the pic, she wrote, “Lighter for Fall 💇‍♀️.” 
This is the first new hairdo that the model has debuted since she and husband Justin Bieber welcomed their son Jack Blues Bieber in August. They announced his birth with a post on Instagram showing his tiny foot and Hailey’s manicured hand, writing in the caption, “WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER 🐻.”
A few days after Jack’s arrival, a source told People that Justin is “already a great dad.”
“The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for. The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant, was the best ever for Justin,” the insider continued. “He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them.”
They added, “The baby is such a miracle. He’s adorable and doing well. Hailey’s doing well too.”
The couple first revealed they were expecting in May of this year when they shared photos and videos from their vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii. In the images, Hailey is wearing a form-fitting white dress that showed off her baby bump. In an interview with W Magazine, Hailey said, “I was honestly able to keep it quiet because I stayed small for a long time. I didn’t have a belly, really, until I was six months pregnant, which was when I announced it. I was able to wear big jackets and stuff.”
