If you’re like me, you spend a lot of August yelling “Summer is over!” to your nearest and dearest — and they don’t take kindly to that. Summer TV is in its twilight, while fall premieres loom on the horizon after the Emmy Awards on September 15.
But summer is not over, and there’s plenty of new titles to stream in the Disney bundle (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN). Disney+ will premiere new Star Wars and “Winnie the Pooh” titles for kids, as well as the original series “Are You Sure?!” following BTS’s Jimin and Jung Kook. Hulu will become home to “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” “The Woman King,” “Smile,” and more movie titles, as well as the home for FX series — this month: “The New York Times Presents: Lie to Fly: Documentary Premiere.” Hulu originals “Solar Opposites” returns on August 12, and “Reasonable Doubt” for its second season starting August 22.

The fourthseason of Hulu’s hit comedy moves out of the Arconia — figuratively speaking, but also literally as the Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel (Selena Gomez) pack their bags for Hollywood, where a movie studio wants to adapt their podcast for “the pictures.” But it’s not all glitz and glamor; the trio is still investigating Sazz’s murder (Jane Lynch) to ascertain whether it was a freak accident or an attempt on Charles’ life, and the trail leads them across the courtyard to the Arconia’s mysterious West Tower. This season’s new cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, Kumail Nanjiani, Melissa McCarthy, Molly Shannon, Richard Kind, and more.
