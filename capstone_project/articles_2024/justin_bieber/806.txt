Justin and Hailey Bieber are officially a family of three as the pair announce the arrival of their baby boy.
“WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,” Justin captioned an Instagram photo late Friday night, featuring the bottom of the newborn’s left foot being held by his mother’s hand.
As of Saturday morning, the post — which Hailey also shared in an Instagram Story — had more than 14.5 million likes.
It’s unclear exactly when the A-list couple welcomed their bundle of joy.
The Biebers announced in May they were expecting, with the “Baby” singer sharing a video of pregnant Hailey as the two renewed their vows in Hawaii.
The news came as a surprise, largely due to speculation that all was not well in their marriage — thanks in no small part to a cryptic post by Hailey’s dad, Stephen Baldwin, asking for prayers for the pair.
It was quickly reported the couple, who married in 2018 and held a second ceremony the following year, already had “a name that they think is perfect,” an insider told People at the time.
A source also noted the duo “will be great parents, and Justin will be super involved.”
“This will be the next important project for him,” the source said. “He’s so excited to raise his baby.”
Earlier this month, Bieber went viral on TikTok for yelling at a group of teens trying to film him as he waited to meet his supermodel wife for lunch at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills. A source at the time told TMZ he was just looking out for Hailey’s safety.
