Hip-hop has been frothing with scandal in the wake of Diddy being arrested and indicted for sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Salacious, negative rumors about Diddy and other celebrities have been swirling for years. One person who has been peddling wild claims against Puff, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj and others has been singer Jaguar Wright.
A New Jersey native, Jaguar Wright is a singer who got her start in the 1990s. She has released two albums, Denials Delusions and Decisions in 2002, and the 2005 follow-up Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul. Prior to that, she toured with The Roots. Wright also performed as a backup singer on Jay-Z's 2001 MTV Unplugged performance. She sang on the song "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)." In the past few years, however, Wright, 47, has become most known for stirring controversy.
Jaguar Wright has made scandalous claims about many people over the last few years.
It's worth noting, there is no basis for Wright's claims. She has her own issues. Her mental health has been called into question. In January of 2023, she was arrested after allegedly assaulting her husband, who claimed she also threw their son's ashes out of a window during the incident. This past June, she was arrested again for theft in Texas. At the time, she claimed the arrest was false and an attempt to silence her. It doesn't appear to have worked.
