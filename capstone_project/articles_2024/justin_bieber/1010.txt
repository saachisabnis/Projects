Perrie has returned with her second solo single of the year, "Tears".
Hot on the heels of her debut single, "Forget About Us", Perrie has shared "Tears". “This song is about coming out of a bad situation and letting go of what has happened in the past," she explains. "It's that point where you feel empowered, and you leave the tears behind because you've come out the other side. It’s a sultry and smooth track that I'm really excited for you all to hear.”
Perrie has spent the past year and a half working on her debut solo album. Nearly all of it was written and recorded at her North London home, working with producers and co-writers including artists such as Ed Sheeran and RAYE as well as Johnny McDaid, Feli Ferraro (BTS, Normani) and Jon Bellion (Maroon 5, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber)— which allowed her to be as vulnerable and creative as possible for this debut product.
“Going into sessions as a solo artist now and being able to say what I want and I feel is just the most amazing experience. I’ve never really done that before—that’s why I’ve wanted to just explore all my different emotions and different parts of my life.”
"Tears" is out now.
