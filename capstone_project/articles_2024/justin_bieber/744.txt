SZA, the acclaimed artist known for her genre-blending music, challenges the notion of being labeled solely as an R&B artist because of her race. In a conversation with Dazed, she candidly expressed her frustration: “The only reason I’m defined as an R&B artist is because I’m Black.”
She points out the disparity in labeling, highlighting Justin Bieber’s freedom to explore various genres without being confined to a single label. Despite her success and critical acclaim, she feels restricted by the industry’s tendency to pigeonhole artists based on race.
“I simply just want to be allowed the same opportunity to make whatever I want without a label, [without it being] based on the color of my skin,” SZA asserts.
This sentiment echoes a broader conversation about how Black women in music are often hastily categorized without a thorough examination of their work’s complexity and depth.
SZA’s refusal to conform to labels extends beyond her music. As she reflects on her evolving sense of self-expression, she emphasizes the importance of embracing change and authenticity. “Self-expression is supposed to change and morph,” she states, highlighting her journey towards embracing her playful and childlike nature.
Her recent collaboration with Australian sunglasses brand Quay, titled ‘Sides of SZA,’ reflects her multifaceted personality. Through this partnership, she aims to empower fans to embrace their individuality and protect their energy.
SZA’s vision for the future extends beyond music and fashion. She speaks passionately about her interest in agriculture, particularly volcanic soil’s potential to enhance human health and nutrition. Her excitement for exploration and discovery underscores her commitment to personal growth and community-building.
In a world where labels often overshadow individuality, SZA remains unapologetically herself—a dynamic artist defying categorization and inspiring others to do the same. As she continues to challenge norms and push boundaries, her influence transcends music, leaving an indelible mark on culture and society.
