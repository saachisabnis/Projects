 Hailey Bieber is sharing a new baby bump photo as she celebrates the milestone of her other baby — skincare line Rhode!

 On Saturday, June 15, the founder, 26, posted a photo of her growing bump in a carousel of images as she marked the second birthday of Rhode on Instagram.

 “2 years of @rhode 😭,” Bieber wrote in the caption. “Feel so very grateful that I get to bring this world of rhode to life everyday with the most incredible team of extraordinary, talented people.”

 “So thankful beyond words for the support and the love shown … and we’re just getting started 😝 HBD rhode 🫶🏼💫,” she added. 

 In the photo, a smiling Bieber posed to the side cradling her baby bump, which was exposed as she wore a white cropped T-shirt and unbuttoned jeans, with four Rhode lip products in her back jeans pocket. 

 Bieber and her husband Justin Bieber, 30, announced they were expecting their first baby together in a joint Instagram post on May 9. The couple celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary in September 2023. 

 Other photos in Hailey's latest post showed her at various Rhode photoshoots, including one of her posing in scuba gear on the beach with model Candice Swanepoel, and her posing in a car next to a box of Krispy Kremes while promoting Rhode’s collaboration with the doughnut company in August 2023.

 “Itty bitty bits of may 🍓🍑🍎,” the caption read. “P.s. we’ve been working hard on some new things for you that are coming very soon,” she teased.
