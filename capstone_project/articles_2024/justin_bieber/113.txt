Justin Bieber was reportedly hit with a whopping $380,349 bill for unpaid property taxes on his $16.6 million home in Coachella Valley, which he purchased in January 2023.
Official records obtained by the US Sun reveal half of the payment was due earlier this month on Oct. 12, while the other portion is owed by April 10 next year.
A rep for the singer did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment. 
The news comes days after TMZ reported the “Baby” hitmaker has been having financial woes.
Sources told the outlet Bieber, 30, was considering suing his former business managers for allegedly squandering his fortune.
However, his team has reportedly been divided on a potential lawsuit since the singer — who has an estimated net worth of $300 million after selling his music catalog — is allegedly irresponsible with his funds.
In fact, an insider exclusively told Page Six last week that the pop star’s spending is “out of control.”
“He spends eye-watering amounts per month. At one point, he couldn’t even get a credit card,” the source told us. 
“Justin is surrounded by a lot of people that do not have his best interests at heart.”
The insider further claimed Bieber routinely splurges on private jets, houses and church donations.
People reported the Grammy winner severed his relationship with former business manager Lou Taylor in May after working with her company, Tri Star Sports And Entertainment Group, for 18 months.
In a statement to the US Sun on Wednesday, Tri Star said Bieber is not considering legal action against their company.
“We did nothing wrong in our brief 18 months of representing him, and he is aware of this,” a rep for the company said. “We were not involved in any alleged unpaid property bills.”
