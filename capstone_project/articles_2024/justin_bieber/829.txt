Justin Bieber made a surprise appearance onstage during Don Toliver's concert at the Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 19.
The singer, 30, was attending the show with his wife Hailey, and surprised audience members by performing "Private Landing" live on stage.
Toliver and Bieber collaborated on the song, which also featured artist Future, in 2023.

Hailey Bieber, 27, posted a video of her husband's performance, and fan videos captured her dancing to his music in the crowd. The couple, who have been married since 2018 and began dating in 2015, welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, in September 2024.
Justin has been keeping a low profile of late. One fan on X commented: "i thought id never see him leave the house until 2025 omggg." Staying out of the news has been difficult, however, as videos linking him to the disgraced music producer Diddy have circulated. In one video Diddy, who has been accused of sex crimes by more than 120 people, says he has "custody" of Bieber, and in another, he appears to pat the younger singer down as if looking for a wire.

Bieber's surprise performance, as well as recent photos he posted with a keyboard and microphone, have fans wondering if the "Peaches" artist could be working on a new album. "You know he's making a banger. The passion that Justin has when making music is unreal. Beautiful being, with beautiful words to sing," wrote one ecstatic fan. "Go Justin!!, we love you and we're impatient to hear your new music, first of all take care yourself, your wife and your son JBB❤️ don't forget that you have fans that love you and believe in you, take your time and turn back with more power💪...Belieber forever," wrote another.
