When the world’s most famous couple hit the Coachella music festival in April, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce didn’t have to venture far to find refuge from 200,000 sets of prying eyes. “I’ve got a cheat code,” Kelce later revealed. “I know where to stay.”
The pair turned to the Madison Club, an ultra-luxe sanctuary across the street from the concert grounds. A diamond in the California desert, the Madison Club, in the town of La Quinta, is a hidden oasis of rolling hills, world-class golf—and scores of vacationing celebrities, business executives and at least three billionaires.
The 500-acre patch boasts some 200 custom mansions dotting 18 lush greens designed by golf course legend Tom Fazio. Admission will cost you: Homes in the very gated community run upward of $30 million, and dues are $500,000 upfront plus $75,000 a year. But membership has its perks, including a top-notch day spa and, for golfers, “comfort stations” every four holes offering everything from ice cream sandwiches to bottles of tequila. “It’s the most exclusive country club in the Coachella Valley,” says local realtor Elaine Stewart.
The neighborhood has history. Celebrities have been road-tripping, jetting and choppering the 100 miles from Hollywood to the Palm Springs area for a century, dating to the eras of Greta Garbo and Frank Sinatra. The current crop of A-listers has fallen for the modern-but-casual Madison, which developer Mike Meldman sculpted out of a flat piece of ranchland beginning in 2005.
“I was inspired by the area’s relaxed attitude,” says Meldman, who has developed 35 high-end ’hoods around the world through his Scottsdale, Arizona–based Discovery Land Company and who cofounded Casamigos Tequila with pals Rande Gerber and George Clooney. “It’s a place where everyone can relax and have a good time.”
Here’s a peek through the palm trees at some of the most notable members of this super-private club.

Kylie, 26, later built her own modern getaway next door; Kim, 43, has a two-acre double lot up the road; Kourtney, 45, bought a $12 million place a few streets over in 2021.
