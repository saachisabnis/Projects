The share price of music rights fund Hipgnosis gained after the opening bell on Monday in London after private equity firm Blackstone's all-cash offer for the fund was recommended by the company's board.
Blackstone outbid a revised offer by Concord Music, trumping its $1.25 per share bid with a play of $1.30. The deal currently on the table values the fund, which owns the rights to music by the likes of Shakira, Bon Jovi and Beyonce, at about $1.57bn (£1.25bn).
Hipgnosis Songs Fund's board said it has "decided to withdraw its recommendation for the Concord Revised Offer”.

Concerns about demand weighed on oil prices on Monday, after a rally last week, with Brent crude and crude both falling close to 1% in early trade.
Last week, prices had jumped following inflation data out of the US which meant bets on expedited rate cuts were pared back further.
Meanwhile, deescalating tensions in the Middle East have improved sentiment about supply constraints.
The usually steady yen has had a volatile few days of trade, wobbling 1.5% lower against the dollar overnight — to its lowest point since the 1990s — as traders watch for further potential government interventions in the economy.
Last month the Japanese central bank hiked rates for the first time in 17 years, bringing the key base rate above zero. Rates were left unchanged on Friday in the latest move by the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
"The BOJ’s dovishness in keeping rates unchanged late last week was an open invitation for yen sellers and the pace quickened as Asian markets reopened late last night; though notably Japan is shut for a holiday," said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto.
