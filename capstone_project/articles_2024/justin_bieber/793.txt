Hailey Bieber looked stunning in an all-black look as she hit the red carpet without her husband Justin just days after slamming "false" rumours circulating on social media about her marriage to the Baby singer.
The 27-year-old model attended the Vanity Fair x Saint Laurent x NBC Universal Oppenheimer Film Toast bash in Los Angeles on Friday, joining celebrities including Zoe Kravitz and Salma Hayek. Hailey wore black, loose-fitting trousers paired with a blazer with buttons in the front.
She finished the look with dark brown closed-toed heels that were in contrast with the all-black outfit. She styled her hair in light waves flowing down past her shoulders.

Her make-up was simple, with bronze shadow around her eyes and a layer of mascara on her lashes. She also added a warm blush to her cheeks and a glossy, nude-coloured tint on her lips.
Hailey was seen at the event shortly after she took to Instagram to slam "false" theories surrounding her marriage to Justin. The claims were spread after her father, Stephen Baldwin, asked for prayers for the couple.
She posted: "Just FYI the stories and constant 'blind items' I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong. Made out of thin air... come from the land of delusion." Hailey then apologised for disappointing anyone with the truth by adding: "So I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they're always false xx sorry to spoil it." Hailey's famous dad Stephen caused controversy when he shared a video of Justin singing on his Instagram page.
The caption on the clip read: "Christians please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection, and draw close to the Lord." Hailey was reportedly left fuming at her father for the update as it referred to a private matter.
The post upload was originally posted by Victor Marx and was a video of Justin playing a guitar and singing a Christian song called I Will Sing of Your Love Forever. While it is unknown why Stephen was asking for prayers, TMZ claimed that sources close to Hailey say the couple are going through a "private" family matter.

To celebrate the couple's five year wedding anniversary last year Justin shared a sweet picture of the pair kissing with the caption: "To the most precious, my beloved. 5 years. You have captivated my heart. I know from the depths of my soul down to my bones that this journey with you will only exceed our wildest expectations. So letâ€™s keep dreaming big baby.
