The Biebers are at the Bowl. 
Hailey Bieber rocked the ‘mob wife’ trend as she showed up to Super Bowl 2024 in style, arriving with husband Justin Bieber in a leopard-printed fur coat at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.
The Rhode founder, 27, and the “Baby” singer, 29 — who fans are hoping will make a cameo during Usher’s halftime performance — passed up football jerseys in favor of decidedly more glam looks on Sunday, with the fashion-forward couple rocking leather and fur looks to the big game.
Hailey leaned into the “Sopranos” aesthetic in her leopard-print Saint Laurent jacket with enormous shoulder pads, pairing the coat with light-wash jeans and a simple white T-shirt.
Mrs. Bieber added pointy red Jil Sander heels ($1,020) and aviator sunglasses to her look, wearing her brunette hair down in soft waves. 
As for Justin — who gave Hailey a sweet kiss on the cheek when they were shown on the Jumbotron’s kiss cam — he showed off some skin (and his many tattoos), wearing an unbuttoned brown printed Marine Serre shirt under a black leather jacket.
The “Ghost” singer teamed his bare-chested look with baggy jeans and red shoes, wearing a backward baseball cap and tiny shades. 
On Friday, TMZ reported that Justin might be joining Usher for a surprise appearance on stage at halftime, with fans going crazy over his potential performance.
Justin was snapped with Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kendall Jenner at a Vegas hotel on Saturday, adding fuel to the fire that he might join Usher for the halftime show. 
“He better perform with usher tonight. They have the chance to do something so iconic,” one fan commented on Pop Crave’s tweet showing the Biebers arriving to the stadium. 
“I better see him on stage” another added. 
While it seems unlikely that we’ll see the Biebs on stage, at least he’s likely to hit up the after parties with his friends.
