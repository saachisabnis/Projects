Trippie Redd is understandably upset after leakers shared more unreleased tracks including a collaboration with Justin Bieber. The Ohio rapper took to X on Sunday afternoon, October 13, and put a fan page on blast for allegedly uploading a fresh song with the Biebs reportedly called "I'd Say." In his post, Trippie demanded people to stop leaking his music. He also said he plans to blame the leakers if he doesn't get another collaboration with the pop star. “If i don’t get another song with beiber yall fault wtf,” he wrote. “My last 4 albums leaked a week before it came out. Don’t yall get tired of doing that s**t.”
Trippie Redd said he's been a victim of scammers who have allegedly leaked music from his past four albums including his 2023 LP Mansion Muzik. The 25-year-old artist originally intended to release the album as a double-disc project. Unfortunately, he said he was forced to rush the album rollout and put it out due to leakers. "Only reason mansion music wasn’t a 2 part album is cuz yall leak all the songs at once so i had to rush it out. Ts annoying atp," he wrote. 
Trippie Redd is preparing to drop his next album LIVE LOVE LAUGH DIE. Throughout the year, he dropped several tracks that might be on the project including "LGLG," "Bando Kid" and "Murderman" with VonOff1700 and Lazer Dim 700. As of this report, there's no confirmed release date.
