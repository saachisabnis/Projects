Australian rapper The Kid Laroi will be staging a concert in Singapore this November. The Stay hitmaker, whose real name is Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard, is set to electrify the stage at Singapore Expo Hall 7 on Nov 1.
LAMC members can enjoy a presale session on Wednesday (Aug 28) at 10am. To get in on this, you'll need to register via LAMC's official website.
General sales will then commence from 12pm that same day via Sistic. Ticket prices will be announced at a later timing.
The Kid Laroi started his career by uploading his raps on the music platform SoundCloud. His debut mixtape in 2020 topped Australia's ARIA album chart, making him the youngest Australian solo artiste to do so.
His big break came in 2021 via the track Stay which featured Justin Bieber. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 and won numerous awards including Top Collaboration and Top Streaming Song at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards.
In 2023, he won praise for staging an impromptu performance at a Malaysian hotel for his fans, following the cancellation of Good Vibes Festival.
