Usher’s Super Bowl halftime show performance will be one to remember for many reasons, but right now, everyone is talking about his sizzling duet with Alicia Keys. 
The U Remind Me singer, 45, was the entertainment in the middle of the NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs in Las Vegas on Sunday evening. 
Fans of the R&B legend took a trip down memory lane as he reeled off songs from his catalogue, including Burn, Confessions, Yeah! and Caught Up. 
However, it was his sizzling duet with Alicia, 43, on their 2004 hit My Boo which has become a highlight. 
Social media users quickly commented on the chemistry between the two stars as they hugged and swayed to the romantic song. At one point, Usher was seen snuggling into Alicia’s neck and wrapping his hands on her waist as they performed. 
Viewers were in a tizz over the whole spectacle with many highlighting how comfortable Usher was with Alicia, who is married to music producer Swizz Beatz.
X user @BabyM07 commented: ‘They gave couple goals.’ 
@mohsinbutt1983 said: ‘Usher was getting a lil to close to alicia keyes [sic].’ 
@LilTravi2 also weighed in, joking: ‘As soon as Alicia Keys gets home from the Super Bowl it’s all Usher’s fault.’ 
@ccruzitoo31 weighed in: ‘Usher was gettin a lil too close to my girl Alicia she is MARRIED.’ 
Swizz Beatz, real name Kasseem Dean, eventually waded into the debate and revealed his true feelings about their performance. 
‘Y’all talking about the wrong damn thing !!! y’all don’t see that amazing dress covering the entire stadium,’ he wrote on Instagram, complimenting Alicia’s stunning stage outfit. 
He added: ‘Tonight’s performance was nothing but amazing with 2 amazing Giants ! Congrats @usher and my love @aliciakeys that song is a classic. We don’t do negative vibes on this side we make history ✌🏽 Go see GIANTS at @brooklynmuseum it’s open until July blessings.’ 
Swizz, 45, was praised for his response, with @Claressashields commenting: ‘I love Swizz Beats response! It was nothing wrong with how Usher & Alicia Keyes performed together! This just shows how insecure this generation of men are!’ 
Instagram user @Ursula_Dlamini said: ‘Being secure in your relationship is the biggest flex!!’ 
Hadidas_1 agreed: ‘Thank you for destroying all that negative commentary King. It was such a great performance!’ 
Alicia and Swizz have been married since 2010 and share two children. 
Meanwhile, Usher is believed to be on his way to the altar after reportedly obtaining a marriage license with his partner Jennifer Goicoechea right before the Super Bowl show.
Following weeks of anticipation that Baby hitmaker Justin Bieber would join Usher for their pop smash Somebody to Love, alas, he was a no-show.
Well, he showed up. He just stayed in the stands instead.
Plenty of fans were quick to air their disappointment over the missing duet.
X user @ohursovicious wrote: ‘usher brought all those people on stage and not one of them was justin bieber,’ after the star was joined by powerhouse vocalist Alicia as well as Ludacris, Lil Jon, Will.i.am, and H.E.R.
@kaylaxvrd added: ‘count your days usher, justin bieber, hailey bieber, whoever is responsible for justin not performing. you deprived us of this.’

@swapitdrws added: ‘love or hate him but it clearly should be Justin Bieber, because rumors of him just having a guest appearance, overshadowed the entire halftime show and had EVERYONE waiting to see him hold a mic next to Usher.’
Usher kicked things off with his tune Caught Up, wearing a massive white coat before shedding layers throughout the set, at one point removing his shirt completely – a moment that (obviously) received rapturous applause from the 65,000-strong stadium.
During a rendition of U Don’t Have To Call, the R&B icon also gave a sweet shoutout to a loved one.
He said: ‘Hey, mom. We made it, now this, this is for you.’
It didn’t take long for the stars to appear, as Alicia wowed us all with a duet to If I Ain’t Got You, which she played on piano.
The songstress looked gorgeous in a sizzling red sequined bodysuit, getting up from the piano to share a rather intimate moment with Usher as he wrapped his arms around her waist playfully.
Lil John and Ludacris jumped on stage soon after, accompanying Usher for his 2004 smash hit Yeah!
Usher then launched into Confessions and Burn before totally stripping off and revealing just a medallion, while H.E.R. shredded on guitar. 
He gyrated through his track U Got It Bad, continuously lapping up the attention with slick dance moves and hip thrusts.
For OMG, Usher changed into his skates as Lil Jon got the crowd vibing to Turn Down For What.
Rounding things off, Usher switched from his white look (well, what was left of it) into a sparkly blue and black number.
Reacting to the incredible set, social media users were sent into a frenzy.
‘Usher just single handedly brought back roller skates…’, quipped X user JacobHester18.
‘Usher was everything my millennial heart wanted’, said jenniferlever.

User onlydioria penned: ‘usher, lil jon, and ludacris being together again literally felt like the infinity stones all got collected’.
Others hailed him as a ‘legend’ while some were even in tears over the nostalgia hit.
While fans will likely be rewatching the performance for months to come, there’s also a behind-the-scenes insight to look forward to.
Usher has revealed that acamera crew had been documenting the experience, from when he got the first call to when he walked off the stage.
The world-famous star, whose latest album titled Coming Home was released on Friday, follows in the footsteps of pop star Rihanna who used her 2023 half-time performance to debut her second pregnancy.
His performance marks 30 years since Usher released his debut, self-titled album in 1994.
