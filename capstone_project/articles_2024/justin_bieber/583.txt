The X Factor has said Liam Payne will “leave a lasting legacy on the music industry” through his time in One Direction, following his death.
The singer rose to stardom at the age of 16 after joining the boy band on the ITV singing competition in 2010 alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan, having returned to the show two years after his first audition.
Music stars and famous faces have been paying tribute to the 31-year-old after he died falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, local police said.

“We are heartbroken by the sad passing of Liam Payne,” The X Factor’s official account on X, formerly Twitter, wrote alongside a photo of the star.
“He was immensely talented and, as part of One Direction, Liam will leave a lasting legacy on the music industry and fans around the world.
“Our thoughts are with his friends, family and all who loved him.”
Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood remembered performing alongside Payne and One Direction for a performance of the boy band’s track Where Do Broken Hearts Go on The X Factor in 2014.
“I am shocked and saddened to hear of the death of Liam Payne. It was a pleasure to work with him on our X Factor performance,” Wood wrote as he paid tribute on Instagram.
“God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed.”

Former Love Island host Laura Whitmore described the singer as “always so lovely and giving of his time” when she had met him over the years.
She recalled interviewing him at the Brit Awards one year when she could she see he was “very loved up with someone backstage”.
“Sometimes we forget people in the public eye are real people with real feelings,” she added.
“He was a pop star but more importantly someone’s son, father – loved by so many who are left heartbroken. My thoughts with his loved ones. I can’t believe it, but also I can. Which is devastating.”

BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James opened his breakfast show by telling listeners the news had been “unbearably sad” to wake up to and that he would be processing it with them.
He also told fans: “It might be the first time someone you’ve idolised has died and that’s a really strange thing to get your head around. So go easy on yourself today because it’s a shock, it’s destabilising.
“Even though you may not have not known Liam Payne personally we do have these para-social relationships where we do know these people to a certain extent and they are part of our lives and when they’re gone that’s weird to deal with.”
Paying a personal tribute to Payne, James said he had interviewed Payne only a few times but when he did he thought he was “so fun”, “funny” and “sweet”, before playing One Direction hit single What Makes You Beautiful.

Singer Olly Murs, who starred on The X Factor a year before One Direction, said on Instagram that he was “lost for words”, describing Payne’s death as “devastating”.
“We always had a good laugh when we saw each other, sometimes the catch-ups were only short and sweet but when we did it was mostly about how annoyingly good his hair always looked, or our love for Becks, the old XF (X Factor) days and the tour we shared together,” Murs wrote beside a picture of the two.
“Liam shared the same passions as me, the same dreams so to see his life now end so young hits hard, I’m truly gutted and devastated for his family and of course his son Bear losing a dad.”

The singer and presenter said he was “absolutely heartbroken” by the news of his death, adding: “Liam, you wanted to be a global superstar and you did it bro, just can’t believe that things have ended this way, it’s shocking. My thoughts and prayers are with all your family and friends brother.”

Singer Cher Lloyd remembered competing on The X Factor in the same year as Payne and One Direction, as well as visiting his family, going on tour together and watching him achieve his dreams.
“I’ll cherish the memories made and the laughs we had. My thoughts are with your family and friends, with everyone who loves you”, she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of them from their days in the singing competition.
“My heart is breaking for your Son Bear. Rest in peace Liam.”

Singer Beverley Knight said she had followed the success of her fellow Wolverhampton native and felt “immense pride that a young lad from my town had become a worldwide star, a member of one of the best-selling boybands of all time”.
She added that her heart was “shattered” for his parents and his son Bear, born in 2017, whom he shared with his former partner, Girls Aloud singer Cheryl.
Former The Xtra Factor presenter Konnie Huq said she told Payne when Justin Bieber was on the show that he would “be as big as him one day” and Payne was “self-deprecating” but “absolutely did get to that level”.
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I actually found out last night (about his death), but ‘just a boy’ is so right, because really all he’s known in his adult, and pre-adult life as well to some extent, is being in the limelight and thrust into this position of global fame, not just sort of being known in your own country, but everywhere, essentially.”

“Over the last few years I had the pleasure of getting to know him personally and spent some treasured time with him,” he said on Instagram.
“Liam was absolutely wonderful in terms of support when Tom (Parker) fell ill, performing at the Royal Albert Hall with us for Stand Up To Cancer.
“He supported me a lot personally after Tom passed. I will never forget that.”
Payne attended the funeral of Parker, who died in March 2022 at the age of 33 after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.
US singer Charlie Puth, a co-writer on Payne’s 2017 song Bedroom Floor, said he was in “shock” after Payne’s death.
“Liam was always so kind to me,” he posted on Instagram, alongside a collection of photos of the pair working together.

Fellow boy band the Backstreet Boys also paid tribute, saying their hearts go out to “Directioners around the world”.
Words can not express the emotions we are collectively feeling right now, and it seems like the rest of the world is in the same boat.
Our hearts go out to Liam’s family, friends, and Directioners around the world.
Rest in peace brother.
