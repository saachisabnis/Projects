Usher addresses fan theories after all of his tweets were deleted. 
After fans began to speculate that his tweets were deleted after the arrest of Bad Boy founder, Diddy, the “U Remind Me” singer said that his account was hacked. He wrote, “Account got hacked, and damn y’all ran with it! See you tonight at Intuit Dome.”

However, fans quickly responded with disbelief that the singer’s account was hacked. One fan wrote, “Nobody’s buying that dude. You better find yourself a nice non-extradition island to go to and stay there for a while.”
