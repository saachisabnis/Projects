Selena Gomez has long been a beacon of authenticity, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. From her iconic ballad "The Heart Wants What It Wants" to her recent heartfelt revelations, the "Only Murders in the Building" star has recently decided to share glimpses into her romantic journey. Now, her blossoming relationship with music producer Benny Blanco has taken center stage, offering fans a hint of a genuine and surprising love story.  
Gomez, 32, doesn't wait around for love to come knocking. According to Benny Blanco, whom she's been dating since 2023, she initiated their romance. During a November 19 livestream with Kai Cenat, Blanco shared how the "Wizards of Waverly Place" alum confidently asked him out.  "She asked me out," the 36-year-old producer revealed. "We were just talking, and then she was like, 'Do you wanna get dinner?'"
 But what makes the story even sweeter is how Gomez managed to keep Blanco guessing during their initial outings. "We just went and got a drink first, and I didn't even realize we were on a date," he explained. "She was like, 'I would've worn something different to this date.' And I was like, 'Wait, what? We're on a date?' I had no idea!"  
It wasn't until their second hangout that Blanco caught on to her feelings. "I was like, 'Yo, I think she likes me,'" he gushed. "Then I literally just kissed her, and then the rest is history."  
Now, more than a year into their relationship, Gomez and Blanco have formed a bond that goes beyond romance. "She's my best friend — actual best friend," Blanco said, emphasizing their deep connection. Gomez has echoed these sentiments, describing their relationship as one of the most secure and meaningful she's ever had. 
In an interview with "The Hollywood Reporter" published November 20, the singer opened up about why this romance feels so different. "I guess this is the safest I've ever felt in one," she said. "And I see a future with this person. And when you put a little bit out there, people are not as hungry to hunt you down."   
While Gomez has been notoriously private about her past relationships, which include Justin Bieber and Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, better known as The Weeknd, this time, she's been more willing to share glimpses of her love life with fans. From sweet social media posts to public outings, her openness signals a new level of confidence and joy. 
 Still, Gomez is careful to maintain boundaries. "There's so much of my relationship people don't see, that's just mine," she explained, highlighting the balance she's struck between living in the public eye and preserving intimacy.
