Stephen Baldwin is officially in grandpa mode ‚Äî and loving every minute of it.
The 58-year-old Hollywood star opened up about his new grandson, Jack Blues Bieber, who his daughter Hailey Bieber and her husband, Justin Bieber, welcomed in August. And if you ask Baldwin, the four-month-old baby's appetite is already impressive.
"He's just a little muffin, and he's eating like a pig," Baldwin shared with People in an interview published Tuesday, December 17. "He's looking cuter than ever."
That hasn't been the only update the proud grandpa has shared about the infant's baby-sized glow-up. Ahead of his appearance on Special Forces: World's Toughest Test on Monday, December 16, Baldwin couldn't help but gush over baby Jack's holiday-ready cuteness ‚Äî and his ever-growing resemblance to a root vegetable.
"We're getting ready for Christmas with Baby Jack Blues," the Usual Suspects actor told TooFab. "We're excited. And he's grown like a weed. Actually, he looks like a little plump potato. He's so cute. I can't stand it."

Jack Blues is the first child for Hailey and Justin, who have been married since 2018. The couple kept their pregnancy low-key before announcing their small bundle's arrival on Instagram. The 30-year-old "Peaches" singer captioned a photo of his son's tiny foot, "WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER üêª."
Stephen was quick to share his excitement on social media, posting the same photo on X (formerly Twitter) with a heartfelt message: "#Congratulations Mr&Mrs Bieber üéà #Grandson ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• #blessed."

Although Jack is still too little to talk, the family man already has his grandpa nickname ready to go. "We're going with Grampy. But it's with a W. A lot of people don't know that," he explained to the outlet. So G-W-A-M-P-Y is Gwampy. So that's kind of the handle I've been going with. It was my granddaughter Iris, my first grandchild. It was the name she gave me."
Baldwin, who shares daughters Hailey, 28, and Alaia with his wife Kennya Baldwin, became a grandpa for the first time in 2020 when Alaia, now 31, welcomed Iris with her husband Andrew Aronow.
