It's time to ring in the new year with some brand new music!
While 2023 was a big year for the music industry, with massive releases from Miley Cyrus, Troye Sivan, Kylie Minogue and, of course, Taylor Swift, 2024 is already shaping up to be another huge year for the pop music books.
Some pop stars have already confirmed projects for this year, such asÂ Zara Larsson and breakout "Water" singer Tyla, while artists such as Bleachers and Allie X also have new records on the way in the next few months.
