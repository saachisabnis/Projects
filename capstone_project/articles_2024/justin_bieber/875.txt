Welcome back: The year 2012
The internet is bursting at the seams with conspiracy theories about how Justin Bieber is sending ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez coded messages following her engagement earlier this month.
After just a year of dating, Benny Blanco popped the question to Selena Gomez with a chunky diamond ring and strange rumours of a Taco Bell sponsorship. Despite the upcoming nuptials, people still trapped in the Selena X Justin Bieber era have now speculated that Justin is sending his former flame secret messages via his Instagram account.
A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)
The crazy rumour was birthed after Justin posted a lovey-dovey picture with his wife Hailey, who he got with just a few months after splitting from Selena in 2018. The picture showed them cuddling, with Hailey’s face obscured in his shoulder as Justin looked very ponderous.
He captioned the post with love-heart emojis and set the music to Lizzy McAlpine’s 2022 song All My Ghosts. Naturally, many believe the lyrics of the song are a not-so-gentle nod to Selena and Benny’s news.
“I can see it now, the wedding of the year/I can see it now, he stands up there and wipes his tears/I can see it now, when all my ghosts disappear/I can see it crystal clear,” the heartfelt lyrics read.
Coincidentally – or not, depending on who you ask – Lizzy McAlpine’s song is about trying to move on from past loves as they continue to haunt you. Ringing a bell?
The speculation adds to the running theory that Justin still loves Selena, which, when combined with a source’s statements about how the engagement stung Justin, does paint a pretty suspicious picture.
“Justin is married and has a kid, we all know that but when he heard that Selena was engaged, he’ll even admit, it stung for a brief second,” the source told the MailOnline. “Because even though they will never be friends or date again or anything like that, it is officially the end of an era.”
Despite breaking up over six years ago, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez’s relationship is constantly dragged back into the present as people seek to relive that nostalgic celebrity era.
In the comments of Justin’s post, one person wrote: “Why would you post this song? She’s so sick of that same old love.”
“The song choice and timing is crazy,” another said, while a third added, “I’m married to her, but the great love of my life is you. We understand Justin.”
Someone else theorised: “He’s like dam I got married had a kid but her engagement hurt like a stab in the heart. That’s crazy it’s all in his eyes.”
