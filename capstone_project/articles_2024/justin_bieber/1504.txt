Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber are reportedly "very, very happy" amid speculation that their marriage is on the rocks and they're heading toward divorce.
A source told People that the couple are "doing really well" and aren't letting the rumors of a possible rough patch affect their marriage as they know the real "truth" of their relationship.
"There's no divorce and no truth to that whatsoever," the source told the outlet. "They are very, very happy."
The "Peaches" singer and the Rhode founder tied the knot in 2018, but their relationship has repeatedly be in the public eye for years as wild speculation swirled online. In fact, the 27-year-old model recently had to shut down "false" rumors about her marriage that had been circulating online, including "blind item" gossip with no proof, and slammed them as delusional and wrong "100% of the time."
Rumors about the Biebers' marriage picked up earlier this year after Hailey's father, actor Stephen Baldwin, shared a vague message asking for prayers for the couple that ended up sparking concern after he didn't provide any additional context, leaving many fans to wonder "what happened" and if they were OK. However, the couple were spotted together just hours later attending a late-night church service.
