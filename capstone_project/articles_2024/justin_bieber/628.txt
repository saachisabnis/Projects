Crocs is the fastest-growing “cool” brand among British children, polling has revealed.
The footwear company, known for its range of foam clogs, has jumped 35 places to number 49 in a league table of 100 “cool” companies.
It ranked ahead of Star Wars, the BBC, and Converse.
Helenor Gilmour of Beano Brain, the consultancy wing of Beano comics that conducted the research, said Crocs were becoming more popular with girls.
She credited the turnaround to the growing popularity of “jibbitz”, small gems and charms that fit into the holes of the shoe, with designs ranging from Barbie to Spongebob Squarepants.
“Whilst rising in popularity with both boys and girls, it’s the latter who have really driven the brand up our list,” Ms Gilmour said.

“Exemplifying the post-pandemic shift to loungewear, Crocs have been spotted on Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Justin Bieber.
“An Amazon top seller in 2023, the secret to their appeal lies with the shoe charms and gems (Jibbitz) allowing kids to simultaneously personalise their shoes and curate collections.”
The rise of Crocs represents a turnaround for a brand whose footwear was once considered unfashionable.
Victoria Beckham once said she would “rather die” than wear the shoes after Bieber sent her a pair of lilac Crocs.

The brand recorded a record year of sales in 2023, with revenues of nearly $4 billion (£3.11 billion), after the sale of “jibbitz” hit $250 million, up 17 per cent year on year.
It sells about 150 million pairs of Crocs each year.
Beano Brain’s survey of 21,000 youngsters aged between 7 and 14 found that YouTube was the most popular brand, toppling last year’s winner Netflix, which came second.
Greggs, the bakery chain, was the highest ranked British brand at number 31, while the BBC came in at number 63, up nine places from last year.
