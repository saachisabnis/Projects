Hailey Bieber was spotted having a night out in New York on Saturday alongside her husband Justin Bieber. 
The pregnant model hit the city in a pair of black slingback pumps. The classic and sleek style encompassed glossy satin black uppers along with a sturdy slingback construction, triangular pointed toes and 1 to 2-inch stiletto heels. 
The silhouette is a favorite of Hailey’s, given the style goes with just about everything. Similar silhouettes can be found from both high-end and affordable brands like Saint Laurent, Valentino, Steve Madden, Aldo, Max Mara and Jimmy Choo, among others.

Beyond Hailey, slingback styles, no matter the color or brand, are a favorite of a variety of celebrities including Dakota Johnson, Kerry Washington, Jessica Alba, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brie Larson and Salma Hayek, just to name a few. The silhouette is a closet staple, and for good reason. Beyond being extremely versatile, slingback pumps are exceedingly classic, offering a safe silhouette to fall back on.
In a similarly chic move, Hailey donned a black lace jumpsuit in an illusive see-through style. The striking pregnancy style was form-fitted and included a floral print and lace trim on the bodice. Layered overtop, the model donned an oversized black leather trench coat. Rounding out her look, Hailey toted a shiny black leather mini bag fitted with golden metal closures accompanied by thin black 90s-inspired sunglasses.
