Holiday Inspo
Hailey Bieber is ready for the holidays! The model and businesswoman stepped out in Los Angeles wearing a velvet ensemble during her latest outing, showing off her festive look and celebrating her longtime friend Gigi Hadid's Guest In Residence store opening.
The new mom looked stunning in a red velvet outfit, which consisted of a single-breasted blazer and a matching miniskirt. She paired the look with a black sweater tied around her neck, black stockings, pointed-toe pumps, and a black satin Prada bag.
She styled her hair in a half-up, half-down hairstyle and rocked a soft glam makeup look, including a matte pink lip and rosy blush. She also accessorized with a black bow in her hair and wore minimal jewelry, including a diamond ring and matching earrings. 
Hailey posed with Gigi, who wore a black miniskirt and a striped red-and-brown sweater featuring a white collar. The model paired the look with a brown vest and minimal gold jewelry. She showed off her short hairstyle and was all smiles rocking a cherry-red lip.
Hailey has been out and about during the holiday season, after welcoming her son Jack Blues Bieber with her husband Justin Bieber. She recently attended the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball in Los Angeles, where she introduced singer Tate McRae to the stage.
The businesswoman wore a brown leather dress from Ermanno Scervino and matching tights by Calzedonia, paired with sleek Eva Pumps from Ferragamo. She styled her hair straight and was praised by her fans in the comments. 
“She’s an incredible dancer, she just released her third album and she’s one of my favorite Canadians. My gift to all of you…Tate McRae," she said backstage at the event. “She is just so fresh and beautiful," one person wrote, while someone else commented, “gorgeous woman," adding, "she’s so cute.”
