Hailey Bieber took to social media this Halloween to share a rare photo of her son, Jack—her and Justin Bieber’s first child!
On October 31, the 27-year-old model celebrated the spooky season and reminded fans about the upcoming election in one adorable post. She shared a photo on her Instagram story showing off her “I Voted” sticker, which she creatively placed on baby Jack’s tiny foot.
In the photo, little Jack sits comfortably in a car seat, looking cozy in a magenta onesie while the sticker peeks out on his foot. Hailey wrote over the sweet snapshot, “Happy Halloween! Get out there and vote,” giving her followers a gentle nudge to make their voices heard.
The post quickly caught fans’ attention, as it’s the first picture Hailey has shared of Jack since she and Justin confirmed his birth in late August. Their little one’s arrival was met with excitement from fans, who have been eagerly awaiting glimpses of the Bieber family’s new addition.
This Halloween post was a treat not only for Bieber fans but also a reminder of the couple’s shared values, as Hailey subtly encouraged civic engagement with her “I Voted” sticker. With a rare and adorable snapshot of baby Jack, Hailey made a memorable statement—celebrating family, Halloween, and voting all in one go.
