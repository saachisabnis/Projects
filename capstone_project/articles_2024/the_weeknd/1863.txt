Kendrick Lamar has decided to not give Drake a minute’s peace as he dropped a third diss track — “Not Like Us” — in just as many days.
The track, which was released on Saturday (May 4), doubles down on the Compton native’s previous claims of the Toronto actor-turned-rapper’s predilection for young children.

“Say Drake, I hear you like ’em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any bitch that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your little sister from him,” he spits.
But he didn’t stop there. In addition to making the diss track art a photo of Drizzy’s home in Toronto — complete with “tags” that imply the residents are registered sex offenders (“Certified lover boy, certified pedophiles“) — K. Dot implied that Drizzy slept with Lil Wayne‘s then girlfriend while the Young Money rapper was locked up on a gun charge in New York.

“Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that’s connivin’ / Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizing,” he spit.

Kendrick Lamar’s unrelenting attacks on Drake have been hailed as a master class in diss tracks.
In the early hours of Friday (May 3), K.Dot amped up the rivalry by dropping “6:16 in LA.” A follow-up to “euphoria” from earlier in the week, the cut alleges that people in Drizzy’s own team are praying on his downfall and even leaking information to his adversaries.

That same evening, the Canadian superstar responded with a seven-plus minute joint packaged with a music video that shows a 1996 Chrysler Town & Country (the same make and model of car displayed on the cover art of good kid, m.A.A.d city‘s deluxe edition) being taken to the junkyard and crushed.
In addition to reprising the “Drop, Drop, Drop” from the “Push Ups” outro, the 6 God takes the war of words to a new place by accusing his rival of domestic violence, insincere racial activism, distancing himself from his native state of California and nudging 2Pac‘s estate to have his “Taylor Made Freestyle” removed from social-media platforms, among countless other jabs.

“When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense ’cause she bigger than you?” he raps, poking fun at the Compton native’s height as he has before.
About the Los Angeles native’s image as a force of social commentary, he adds: “Always rappin’ like you ’bout to get the slaves freed/ You just actin’ like an activist, it’s make-believe.”

In addition to suggesting The Weeknd‘s fan base is mostly queer folk, reminding the Hip Hop community of Rick Ross‘ past as a law enforcement officer and firing shots at Kanye West, Future and Metro Boomin, the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker also sets a few bars aside for A$AP Rocky (real name Rakim Athelaston Mayers).
“Rakim talkin’ shit again/ Gassed ’cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin’ then?/ I ain’t even know you rapped still ’cause they only talkin’ ’bout your ‘fit again/ Probably gotta have a kid again ‘fore you think of droppin’ any shit again,” Drake spits.
