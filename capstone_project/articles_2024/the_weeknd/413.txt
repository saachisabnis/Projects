J. Cole proves he's the G.O.A.T. just from features by teaming up with Tee Grizzley for their first-ever collaboration. The Detroit artist shared his new single "Blow for Blow" featuring the Dreamville founder on Thursday, September 26. Cole kicks off the track by jabbing at fake rappers when he raps, "Proceed with throat-cut procedures/He look rich, but he broke, just egregious/Don't trust rappers, ho, trust in Jesus." He closes out his verse by invoking LL COOL J's name and segues to the chorus, in which he flips Mase's classic opening verse on The Notorious B.I.G's "Mo' Money Mo' Problems." 
"Now, who hot? Who not?/Tell me, who flopped? Who sell out the tours? (Me)" Cole spits. Tee Grizzley steps up and fires his own rapid-fire bars on his verse. He reflects on how far he's come in his life and career, and salutes Cole for rocking with him. "Cole say in Fayetteville they go, 'Ayy, ayy, ayy' (What up?)/Fact he f**k me with me like that, it make up for them rainy days (No cap)," he raps. The song is Grizzley's latest knock-out collaboration following his previous singles "Detroit" with 42 Dugg and "Swear to God" featuring Future. All three songs are expected to appear on his forthcoming studio album Post Traumatic, which drops October 11. "Blow For Blow" appears on iHeartRadio's Rap Rising playlist this week alongside other fresh hits from Saweetie, Maxo Kream, A$AP Ferg, Moneybagg Yo and more.
