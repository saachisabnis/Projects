In recent months, many figures in the rap industry have distanced themselves from Drake. Kendrick Lamar, his collaborator on "Poetic Justice," has notably garnered attention, but other rappers have also reportedly taken aim at Drake. Former partners such as Future, The Weeknd, and Metro Boomin have been involved in the conflict due to actions perceived as targeting Drake. Surprisingly, few rappers have publicly supported Drake, although some controversial artists like Jay Electronica, Azealia Banks, and Tom Macdonald have backed the "Rich Baby Daddy" rapper. Notably, 21 Savage, Drake's former collaborator on the 2022 project "Her Loss," has remained silent on the matter. During a recent performance in Kendrick Lamar's hometown of LA, 21 Savage performed their hit track "Rich Flex," with the local audience enthusiastically singing along to Drake's verse. 
This subtle gesture has not gone unnoticed by keen fans. The issue of 21 Savage's silence on the Drake situation was previously raised when Metro Boomin, a vocal critic of Drake, made a cryptic social media post hinting at a potential third installment of his and Savage's "Savage Mode" series. The original "Savage Mode" was released in 2016, followed by a well-received sequel in 2020, prompting calls for a new chapter in the series. Keep it locked to 103.5 The Beat for more!
