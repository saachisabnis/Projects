Monday’s American Idol marked the first live episode of Season 22, a two-hour nail-biter that delivered good news to 14 lucky contestants before casually crushing six others’ dreams in real time. This is where it starts to get messy, folks.
The results were revealed gradually throughout the broadcast, with each contestant either being sent to the Danger Zone, where they had to sing for a second chance, or to the Victory Zone, where they got to sing for America’s next round of votes. (The Top 12 will be revealed live on Sunday, April 21.)
But the contestants’ fates weren’t entirely in the hands of the viewers. Once the 10 viewer-chosen singers were revealed, the judges — Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie — got to decide which four remaining hopefuls from the Danger Zone would join them. So when you’re raging out in the comments section about your favorite singer getting eliminated, be sure to divide the blame equally.
As always, voting for the next round can be cast three different ways — on the show’s official website (americanidol.com), on the American Idol app (available in the App Store), or you can text the number of your preferred contestant to “21523.” Each singer’s number is listed next to their name below.
Read on for a breakdown of the singers who made it into the Top 14 (in order of their appearance), as well as the six contestants eliminated at the end of the night. While you’re down there, vote for the 12 you want to keep in the competition and drop a comment with your favorite performances from Monday’s episode.
The first singer to make it into the Top 14, McKenna celebrated her well-deserved victory with another gorgeous performance of her mother’s original song “Tumbleweed,” somehow improving upon the first rendition she shared during her viral audition. 
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
Quintavious was the first contestant to enter the Danger Zone, hoping that his take on Mariah Carey’s “Make It Happen” would earn him a second chance from the judges. Despite the nerves he must have been feeling, Quintavious kept his cool, delivering a consistently upbeat performance that felt more like a celebration of how far he’s come, rather than a desperate plea for his life. And this greatly worked in his favor; he had the entire venue in the palm of his hand. And that whistle tone at the end? Insane!
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
Charlie Puth’s “Attention” was an appropriate choice for Jordan, who had to sing for the judges’ attention after taking the second seat in the Danger Zone. And he definitely got ours, letting loose with an entirely new side that really impressed us. Dare we call it his best performance yet?
TVLINE’S GRADE: “B+”
One of the least surprising Top 14 entries of the night, Jack was feeling himself all through his rendition of Post Malone’s “Feeling Whitney,” and we felt him right back. (Wait, that came out wrong.) Jack has always felt like he was built in the American Idol Factory, and our appreciation for him only grew tonight with this beautiful performance.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
We weren’t thrilled to see Kennedy land in the Danger Zone, but we also can’t deny that it lit a fire under her — that performance of Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood’s “Somethin’ Bad” was absolutely explosive. Between the vocals and the overall confidence, this was definitely her strongest showing yet, and we couldn’t be more proud.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
We were a little surprised to see Jennifer end up in the Danger Zone, but we weren’t at all surprised by the gorgeous, breathy delivery of her take on Kodaline’s “All I Want.” A heartbreaking song on its own, the whole experience was made even more powerful under the pressure of the competition. The judges keep asking Jennifer for a “step out” moment, but she’s been killing it every week. What are these people hearing (or not)?
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
Another presumed shoe-in for the Top 14, this sleep-deprived singer found himself in the Danger Zone — a result met by a rabid sea of boos, followed by an enthusiastic chant of support. Unfazed by the results, Ajii took the stage for a solid performance of The Weeknd’s “Call Out My Name,” belting out all the growly high notes we’ve come to expect from this consistent treat of a man.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
Mia was ready to take her spot in the Top 14. No, really, she started walking to that Victory Circle before Ryan Seacrest even called her up to hear her results. (Did she already know she was safe? Let the conspiracy theories begin!) Anyway, Mia absolutely reminded us how she earned her spot in the Top 14 with a lovely performance of Cams’ “Burning House.”
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
If Ryan Seacrest ever decides to start a family, we’ll owe it all to Kayko, who put him on the spot on national TV by saying that he seems like he’d make a good dad. Ryan returned the compliment by welcoming him into the Top 14. Cue another killer performance of his original, Dear Evan Hansen-esque song “What If?”, an emotional experience he navigated with impressive vocal trickery.  
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
This confident performer shrugged off the Danger Zone, effortlessly transitioning into a good-time rendition of Tyla’s “Water,” dancing her way further into our hearts and sneaking in some pleasant vocal surprises along the way. It was a fun change of pace, regardless of the outcome.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “B+”
Will’s entry into the Top 14 was a foregone conclusion, so the fact that he followed it up with a perfect performance of his chart-topping original song “Gone For Good” was merely the cherry on top of this flex of a sundae.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
Riding a high from her well-received performance last night, Carter returned to the stage with her best performance of the season, a stunning take on Yebba’s “My Mind.” Those runs? Chilling. That falsetto? Gorgeous. She even nailed most of the bigger notes, even if she pushed herself a little too hard again. (Only for a second!) Overall, this was incredible.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
Odell may not have moved enough of America to vote him into the Top 14, but he moved the entire auditorium with his spirited performance of Elevation Worship’s “Wait On You.” He was feeling it tonight, and he was absolutely right to do so. If this man doesn’t have an incredible future in the gospel music industry, we might as well not even have ears. So well done.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
A few stumbles last night didn’t stop Kaibrienne from scoring a spot in the Top 14, which she celebrated with a dramatic performance of The Cranberries’ “Zombie.” There’s an undeniable pain in her voice, and it served her well in the song’s more emotional moments.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
Mackenzie is always a ball of nervous energy, so we weren’t sure what to expect when he took the microphone to sing for survival this week. But there was really nothing to worry about. In fact, Lawrence’s “False Alarms” may have been Mackenzie’s best performance of the season. He brought it all — the confidence, the vocals, the control. It felt like he had nothing left to lose, but in a hopeful way rather than coming across desperate. 
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
No shoes? No problem. The barefooted singer got a much-needed confidence boost when Ryan Seacrest welcomed her into the Top 14, cuing up another lovely performance of Emmy’s original song “Skinny.” She may be breaking up with skinny, but we’re glad the viewers haven’t broken up with her yet. When she said that singing “Skinny” makes her feel like the person God made her to be, we could tell she really felt it.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
Julia’s show-stopping Fantasia performance last night earned the Platinum Ticket winner a well-deserved spot in the Top 14. To keep going, she busted out a confident, killer rendition of Jelly Roll’s “Need a Favor.” Strong belting abounded, and we give her extra points for that pantsuit.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A”
“She’s done it before!” Katy Perry reminded us when Jayna was told that she’d have to sing for survival tonight. And she certainly sang (and sparkled!) her way through Paramore’s “All I Wanted,” delivering a wonderful surprise of a performance that had us wondering what the viewers were thinking not voting her into the Top 14.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“
The final singer sent into the Danger Zone, Roman fought back with James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World,” and he fought hard. He brought the heat, and he didn’t leave until that stage was absolutely scorched. We’ll be feeling this one for a minute. It honestly might have been the best performance of the night. Heck, he didn’t just blow the roof off that place — he blew Katy Perry’s top off!
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A+”
The 15-year-old phenom was the final singer put through to the Top 14 by way of viewers’ votes, but let’s be honest, he was also one of the least surprising reveals. It’s impossible not to root for Triston, and that feeling was only reinforced by his performance of Cody Johnson’s “‘Til You Can’t,” a considerably more upbeat song for this hardcore country crooner.
TVLINE’S GRADE: “A-“

Voting for Abi Carter her voice is Amazing. Its Authentic and she is definitely top 4. I’m already a fan.
Hm. I have mixed feelings. Pretty surprised that America kept Kaibrienne, Kayko & Will. Also surprised that the judges chose not to keep Quintavious, Odell & Jennifer. Guess they couldn’t handle multiple Gospel singers. NOT surprised that Ajj & Kennedy went home. I was a little worried about Julia; she’s amazing, but didn’t do great last night. I’m glad she made it in, and glad that the judges kept Jayna!
Kayko? His song writing skills are insane. He is my favorite and I can see him and Benson Boone killing it together on tour
I agree about his songwriting skills. But he’s so cheesy I can hardly watch, & his vocals are not that impressive to me. But that’s just me.
Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan are/were not great singers, but their songwriting and overall appeal made them superstars.  Take away Kayko’s glasses and he’s nice looking with great eyes.  He’s headed for stardom.
Exactly!  He is the most all around best Idol contestant up there – he can sing and write and is very mainstream and commercially appealing by far…  The close second to him is Abi…
Kayco has  a good musical material and has good stage presence He’ll make it.
I’m a big fan of Kaibrienne, and when songs get emotional, that tends to connect with America. Unlike some people, I don’t think she did that intentionally. I think she just naturally gravitates towards emotional songs, including in her songwriting. I think she shows tremendous skill in her singing though. It’s not all about belting, and it does bother me when the show focuses so much on that.
OK, but a concert of dripping emotions would be exhausting and depressing.  She needs to sing something upbeat a bouncy.
Pitchy throat singers can’t last in a competition like this.
When Kayko first audition I thought that he wouldn’t get that far, but he has totally surprised me. Some of his original songs have really touched me and that’s hard for this old man to say. I think he will go very far in this competition and if he doesn’t win he already has a life ahead of him in song writing plus singing.
Julia Gagnon is my choice.
I completely agree with you, Julia has a voice to die for. The very first time I heard her sing my first thought was, she’s going all the way!! Now don’t get me wrong, theirs a few more, but Julia has my vote all the way.
1000% this! She transforms from this adorable shy thing to an absolute drop the mic diva the second she opens her mouth! Incredible!
Say what you will, but it seemed ironic that every single minority was in the danger zone.
I noticed the same thing! So unfair
Unfair in what way?  It’s based on merit by public opinion.  There isn’t a quota system. People vote for the singer whose music they’d buy and concerts they’d attend..
Are you real?  Merit and public opion are not synonomous.  American Idol judgement is based on feeling and one’s taste; merit has nothing to do with this.
The definition of merit cites being praiseworthy and deserving of reward and advancement..  That’s exactly what took place on Idol.
I’d say that’s due to the Idol demographic and the music they listen to by choice.  Personally, I lean toward country and classic rock, not R&B, Rap, Gospel, Broadway or Blues.  I only vote for singers I’d pay to see live.
Pretty typical for the ABC era. Unfortunate but true.  The wildcard picks are put in place so they can mask how racist the majority of voters typically are.
How is preferring one genre of music over another racist?    I don’t buy music or concert tix for music I don’t enjoy.   If some contestant played accordion and sang polka music I wouldn’t vote for them.  iMO voting FOR someone just because of their color to push diversity is racist.
And that’s the problem with this so called SINGING contest. That’s why it will never be fair. I don’t like country but I loved listening to Tristian. I voted for him because he has a great voice and he can sing.
You know, it’s still pretty pathetic how ABC and the country seems to only see race when it comes to voting. My wife and I aren’t worried how the person looks, the only thing we hear is the beautiful voice that touches our hearts. That’s the way everyone should be when they watch this show, just hear these young men and women sing and be blessed. If you ever watch this show and you vote due to race, then you shouldn’t be watching this program and you should be doing some soul searching.
Get your point, but technically no. Tristan and Julia are minorities. Literally last year we had a minority win, so let’s jump to conclusions.
It would have been hard to miss.  So disappointing!  Makes you wonder who is voting.
Who is voting?  American idol’s core audience, Grass Roots America.
That seems to have been a pattern for a few years lately. That’s why this will be the last time watching it. This is not a fair singing contest. Anyway I think some of the contestants that went home will still get a music deal. I hope they do anyway.
If the show was on BET would many viewers vote for a white singer?  Just asking.
I think the idol final right now should be
Triston Harper vs Julia Gagnon with because of his age Triston should squeak out a narrow victory but I don’t think Iam Tongi should have won last season but he was everybody’s teddy bear with keep the monsters away but that southern girl was better. I am the #1 performing artist in Burbank Cali  Singer And Dancer.  I am 64 but really I’m 25. I’m still break dancing and I have a magical voice
Beyond upset. Idol so white. Julia only made it, because she has all of Canada voting for her, and Tristan because he sings country.
It’s just unbelievable that incredible singers like Roman, Ajii, and Quintavious didn’t make top ten. And two of them are now gone.
I was blown away, 😳 like wth happened?
The US is only 13.6% black.  How much of that percentage do you think watches American Idol?  And, since AI doesn’t allow Rap, how many young black folks would tune in?  Tristan is doing very well and rightly so.  The fact that he’s singing country is just right for this shows viewers.
And, the advertisers target audience is 18-49.  How many people of color in that age group are home watching Idol on Sunday night?
You make very vaiid points Sue. Are you taken LOL
That would presume that white people only vote for white people and black people only vote for black people.  I’m white and I vote for everyone.  Well, because they can sing.  Can you explain why you only vote for white people then?
People vote for singers to whom they relate.  Add to that the fact that most of the eliminated males were churching it up which young people of color are less likely to embrace.  It boils down to which singer you’d spend $ on.
The eliminated males were literally “young people of color” churching it up.
When you have singers in the same genre, they end up splitting the vote.  That is why Roman, Quintaveous and Odell ended up in the bottom and also why Jennifer and Kennedy were in the bottom.  I knew that was going to happen as soon as they are all together in one group with people voting. I was surprised that the judges did not pick one of the country girls but i knew they were going to only pick one of the Gospel guys.  They were all good though.
My favorites are Kayko,  Jayna, and Mckenna.
The judges are wacked tonight. That was a disservice to the singers who sang dominating performances. Shame on y’all. I hope it’s the last time to get get to do that.
Surprised the judges didn’t save Odell Bunton Jr who IMO was better than a few who were voted into the Top 14.
totally agree! From his performance in Hawaii he commanded the stage and is the whole package! I wish they had a wild card to bring him back!
Why is it so hard for people to not recognize the biological father of McKenna Faith Breinholt? From what I gather he was the other half of the duo that the mother belonged to. So it should be that she sang her mother and father’s song. It’s starting to annoy me. Glad that Will and Mia were safe. They were better tonight than last night. A little surprised that Kaibrienne was safe. Sympathy votes go a long way. I love the Cranberries song, but she didn’t come close to Dolores with her delivery. Sorry. Triston may be the frontrunner. He’s good. Julia was better tonight. Kayko was good once again. Glad that Jennifer wasn’t saved. Thought for sure the judges would save her. Her voice was nails on a chalkboard for me.
No, Amy’s husband/bandmate was not McKenna’s bio dad…
I liked the final 14 but will miss Jennifer. Her voice is intoxicating.
I never got why the judges went gaga over Jennifer.  She was not my cup of tea at all.
everything says vote for your top 12, but tonight April 15, 2024 the site offers no voting! It says “VOTING IS CLOSED” come back tonight” WHAAAT?
so far, everyone I voted for is IN top lineup ( YAY) But HOW and when do we VOTE!
Vote on Sunday
I’m such a fan this year! SO MANY great singers and deserving too. I am a Abi Carter, Mia, Tristan, Jack, FAN!!
As to saved v eliminated, I think many deserved a spot over Nya.
Ryan said it would be rock theme next Sunday for the top 14 with Gene Simmons from KISS. Monday would be the top 12 with Meghan Trainor – not sure about voting on that day, but it would make sense.
I thought I would be watching American Idol this season but because they didn’t do right at the end I will not be watching. It’s a shame how they didn’t let GREAT TALENTED SINGERS make it through. Oh well I’ll keep watching the Voice. Hopefully they will try out for the VOICE and I’ll see them there.
The Voice is all about the judges.  They have no record. for producing a superstar.
There are performers on the voice doing well in country circles
Any as successful as Carrie Underwood, Scotty McCreary, Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert etc.?
Thank you for paying attention, because I absolutely noticed that. Regardless of talent, America will never be color blind!
America isn’t deaf either.  People support the sound that pleases them.  Many of the eliminated singers were forcing their performances way over the top and it was grating, not pleasant.
Ki, you are saying everything exactly how I said it. I’m done watching as well and have watched since the very first season.
I didn’t care much for the artists that play it safe and sing the same hum drum monotone songs. Those artist don’t showcase their vocal ranges. I keep expecting for them to change it up and explore other genres. Kaibrienne, Ali Carter, Jennifer Jeffries, Emmy Russell all play it safe and it’s become snoozeville for me. The choice ought to be someone who can sing all genres and ranges.
I really don’t think the judges got it right.  Roman was definitely a good pick,  I think they could have picked one of the two girls they picked not both. Jordan was really not needed have a lot of white guys similar styles in there. Defintely should have sent O’Dell thru and or Quintavious and maybe Ajii.  The “white” girls we have a lot of similar styles.  Really like Aby and McKenna but Emmy MIA and KB are all really similar.  Not a fan of Kayko he can write songs but his vocals aren’t great.
Will or Triston all the way
With a few exceptions….Idol is going to have a bland rest of the season. All the flavor was illuminated. Not a good look!
Because I live in Canada I can not vote which I think is a shame because if I could vote my votes would be for Emmy Russell number 17. Why can’t Canadians vote since we watch the show and cheer for the contestant that we like only to find out Canadians are not allowed to vote.  Now I am wondering why I am watching a show where my voice can not be heard. Not impressed.
Because it’s called American idol and America votes
The judges saved the wrong ones last night and sent home some that so deserved to be there! My number one choice is Mia Matthews! She awesome. Right now Country music is on fire bringing back real country like Lainey Wilson. Odell should have been saved.
You’re right about country surging as it did in the late 80s and early 09s.  Even Beyonce jumped on that train.  IMO it’s partly due to the popularity of shows like Yellowstone, and that people are hungry for songs that tell stories rather than the bland stuff currently out there.  Rap, IMO, isn’t really music and we need singer/songwriters like Kayko to give us memorable melodies.
They are all good I love watching them sing I hope they all succeed 🙏
No, they absolutely did not save the right singers!! Odell, Ajii, Quintavious most definitely should have been saved. Seriously don’t get the judges & what they see & don’t see sometimes.
Idol final everyone mark my word as I am a star performing artist Triston Harper vs Julia Gagnon Any Takers???
Did anyone else have difficulty voting after the 4/15/24 AI show?  I tried after the show and all night until 4/16/24 and kept getting error message:  voting is now closed.  I relooked at show and they didn’t give any directions for voting for Mondays show?
There was no voting last night
Voting will be next Sunsay, 4/21.
Start calling this show what it is American Idol Country! Look at your top vote getters. Sad that the judges had to put some color into the Top 14! 4 bona fide singers went home last night and that’s too bad. At least 5 do not deserve to be in the top 14. Something needs to be done about the show maybe make an American Idol country edition. America sends too many great singers home year after year!
That is and always has been American Idol’s core audience.  If it isn’t your cup of tea, watch The Voice or America’s Got Talent.   Idol has never been aimed at New York or LA.  It plays to the heartland, rural and suburban viewers.
How old are you Sue if I may ask. I am intrigued by you and if we ever became a couple I’d have someone to watch idol with. I could definitely keep up with you. My female friend who LiVES with ME doesn’t watch idol  with me where are you located  I could travel.
Julia all the way!!! Abi is my second choice
What I don’t understand about Idol and how they’ve been doing this for years is they will tell (taking this season for example) 10 of the top 20 contestants they are in the top 14/voted in by America and then they will tell the other 10 contestants they were not automatically put in to the top 14 – well 4 of those 10 had to be!  When America voted on 20 contestants they definitely HAD to range in number of votes from 1 thru 20 so why doesn’t those voted 1 thru 14 get in and leave the judges picks out of it…  I think this is just so unfair to the contestants who actually DID get voted in and were #’s 11, 12, 13 and 14 based on America’s votes…  None of those 4 contestants should be sent home in favor of contestants the judges prefer to see in there,,,
I totally agree!! It’s  America’s choice not judges
Possibly because the top 10’s numbers were clearly above the rest but the next 4’s numbers were too similar to define?
You’re spot on Gina. Thank you
There are many superb voices on American Idol this year.  In fact, I like most of them,  but my favorite voice and performer is Jack Blocker!   Jack doesn’t seem to get enough credit in my opinion.  He is a natural  —  poised, confident, and very skilled.  To top it off, he’s a likeable guy who always has a smile on his face.  Of late, he seems to have made great progress at conquering the facial expressions which irritated some.  This guy is a natural entertainer who deserves to go far in the competition.
