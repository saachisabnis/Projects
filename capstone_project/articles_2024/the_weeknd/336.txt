	The latest epic from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings together three giants of popular culture: Deadpool, Wolverine and Madonna.

	Marvel’s forthcoming action-comedy “Deadpool & Wolverine” is a superhero dream team, which sees Hugh Jackman reprise his role as the hard-as-nails X-Man Wolverine alongside Ryan Reynolds’ reckless (and foul-mouthed) Deadpool.

	The trailer should fill the cups for anyone weaned on Marvel, comics, action and ‘80s music.

	It’s a two-and-a-half-minute NSFW blockbuster, loaded with fight sequences, drug references, Deadpool crashing through the fourth wall and a carpeting of f-bombs, soundtracked to the Madonna classic “Like a Prayer.”  

	The Queen of Pop’s Billboard Hot 100 leader from 1989 gets a dancey-upgrade for the clip, which was shared on Reynolds’ YouTube page and can be seen in full below.

	Madonna justified her royal status earlier this year as “Popular,” her collaboration with the Weeknd and Playboi Carti, creates an impressive piece of U.K. chart history when it became the U.S. pop veteran’s 64th top 10 single, extending her lead as the female artist with the most top 10s in Official Chart history.

	Madonna sets chart records for fun. According to the Official Charts Company, the superstar singer has 12 U.K. No. 1 albums, the most among solo female artists, though Taylor Swift is days away from equaling that feat. The Like a Prayer LP, which recently celebrated its 35th anniversary, is one of those leaders (it logged two weeks at the chart summit).

	When “Popular” splashed on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2023, Madonna joined Cher as the only women to have debuted titles on the chart in five separate decades (Madonna has debuted songs on the Hot 100 in the 1980s, ‘90s, 2000s, ’10s and now ‘20s). 

	Directed by Shawn Levy, Deadpool & Wolverine is due out July 26 and is Marvel Studios’ first R-rated film. The forthcoming film is the third in the Deadpool series and follows Deadpool 2 by six years.
