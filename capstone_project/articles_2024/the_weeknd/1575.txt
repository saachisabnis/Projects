J. Cole has finally earned his first-ever diamond plaque as his 2019 song “Middle Child” has reached an impressive milestone.
A record receives diamond certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) when it sells 10 million certifiable units in the U.S., with Cole achieving the feat for the first time with the 2019 hit.

Despite hitting eight-figure sales, “Middle Child” never topped the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at No. 26 and peaking a week later at No. 4.
It has, however, gone on to become one of Cole’s most enduring songs.
It was previously reported two years ago that his 2014 track “No Role Modelz” had passed 10 million units but the song was never officially certified diamond by the RIAA.

With the certification, J. Cole joins an esteemed list of Hip Hop stars who already possess diamond plaques.
Eminem leads the way among rappers with six in total. Three are for his albums The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show and Curtain Call: The Hits, while the other three are for the singles “Lose Yourself,” “Not Afraid” and the Rihanna collaboration “Love the Way You Lie.”

J. Cole’s entry into the diamond club means he has pipped “Big Three” rival Kendrick Lamar to the post, despite him previously admitting that he felt inferior to the Compton rap star, as well as Drake.
“Some people say I’m running third / They threw the bronze at me / Behind Drake and Dot / Yeah, them n-ggas is superstars to me,” he rapped on his 2021 track “Heaven’s EP.”

The North Carolina native also bowed out of his recent rap battle with Kendrick after dissing him on “7 Minute Drill,” dividing opinion among rap fans and fellow rappers.
He boldly apologized to his “Forbidden Fruit” collaborator onstage at his Dreamville Festival in April, saying he felt “blessed to even stand beside [Kendrick and Drake], let alone chase their greatness.”
