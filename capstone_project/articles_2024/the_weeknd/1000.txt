He’s back!
On Sunday, January 7, 2024, The Weeknd delivered a gift that many fans had been waiting for. The Canadian pop star issued a cryptic X post featuring the covers of Dawn FM and After Hours alongside a question mark.
“3,” the post’s caption reads.
The Weeknd spent much of last year promoting his HBO drama, The Idol. With the show, viewers were able to get a taste of the singer’s latest work by way of “Popular” featuring Playboi Carti and Madonna. In the midst of crafting the show’s soundtrack and working on other television and film projects, he also mentioned that he was working on the third chapter of a trilogy that began with After Hours and Dawn FM.
“I’m going through a cathartic path right now. It’s getting to a place and a time where I’m getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter,” he told Lynn Hirschberg of W Magazine in May 2023.
“I’ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I’m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.”
While it’s clear that he’s been working hard on a new project, two essential questions remain. What will it sound like and when will fans hear it? Unfortunately, those questions are still without answers, but his latest X post is certainly a step in the right direction.
