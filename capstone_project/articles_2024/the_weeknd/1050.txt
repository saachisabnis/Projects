Record Store Day have announced the full list of exclusive releases for their 2024 event.
Fans can expect collectible and limited-edition records from the likes of Jessie Ware, Noah Kahan, Gabriels, Katy J Pearson, Blur, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and many more.
Newer artists such as Laufey, Holly Humberstone, Fizz, English Teacher, Maisie Peters and BRIT nominees, Young Fathers and Olivia Dean are part of this year’s list, alongside established acts such as The Rolling Stones, Notorious B.I.G, Garbage and Lily Allen, who will be releasing special vinyl editions. The Flirtations prepare to release their first album of new material in over 55 years. Meanwhile George Harrison’s Electronic Sounds and Wonderwall Music are getting a special repress, and John Lennon’s Mind Games will have a unique repress on a limited 12” EP.
 This year’s Record Store Day list also features a solo release from Ringo Starr with a brand-new four track EP, Crooked Boy, alongside songwriter Hall of Fame inductee Linda Perry. Speaking of his involvement, Ringo said: "I'm really excited to be releasing an exclusive edition of my EP Crooked Boy for Record Store Day this year. I've always loved record stores from 81 Renshaw or Brian's North End Music Store in Liverpool to Tower Records and Amoeba Records in LA and I support them with Peace and Love." 
This year’s edition of Record Store Day follows a recent report from the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association revealing that in 2023 vinyl album sales enjoyed yet another year of strong growth of 17.8% compared to the previous year. CDs also recorded their first rise in sales value for two decades, growing 2% and reaching £126.2m.
“We are so excited for the best day of the year to return” said Scott Gamble from Crash Records in Leeds. He added: “Seeing the world's music fans making the effort to queue up outside record shops near and far, building friends in their search of these exciting releases is amazing. It is so humbling to see this support and to make these fans happy. Every year I think we can’t top the last, but the list constantly impresses with literally something for everyone! See you in the queue on 20th April”.
The 1975, who were the 2023 ambassadors of Record Store Day, will be releasing The 1975 Live At Gorilla, which is a live performance recorded on 1 February 2023, which saw them play their self-titled debut album in full for the first time since its 2013 release. Other highlights from the list include Pixies who are unveiling Live From Red Rocks 2005 (RSD 2024), which is available on vinyl for the first time. The 27-song set features all of the Pixies classic material including "Here Comes Your Man", "Where Is My Mind?", "Hey" and "Debaser". 
RSD 2024 ambassadors Paramore are releasing Re: This Is Why on vinyl for the first time. The album sees friends of the band reimagining songs from their sixth studio album, This Is Why, and features Julien Baker on "Thick Skull", "Liar", with The xx's Romy on vocals, a Remi Wolf cover of "You First", a more subdued and acoustic interpretation of "Figure 8" by Bartees Strange, and an unmistakable cover of "C'est Comme Ça by Wet Let's Rhian Teasdale. The RSD exclusive will also feature Jack Antonoff's remix of "Sanity".
In celebration of the 40th Anniversary of The Cure’s fifth studio album, The Top, a limited edition remastered picture disc will be available on 20 April. A previously unissued live radio broadcast from 20 September 1968 allows listeners to hear The Doors at Konserthuset, featuring rare performances of “Mack The Knife,” “Love Street,” and “You’re Lost Little Girl". Gorillaz will release a special RSD deluxe edition of their chart-topping 2023 album, Cracker Island. The one-off release features six additional tracks that haven’t been available on physical formats before and exclusive new album artwork by Jamie Hewlett.
