Add The Weeknd to the steady procession of rappers and singers who have been firing off on Drake in recent weeks.
The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky are swinging at Drake on the Future and Metro Booming’s chart-topping album, We Still Don’t Trust You. 
On the song “All to Myself,” Weeknd slams Drake and Baka Not Nice due to their social media posturing:
 “Could never diss my brothers, baby/When they got leaks in they operation/I thank God that I never signed my life away/ And we never do the big talk/ They shooters makin’ TikToks/ Got us laughin’ in the Lambo.”
Next up to bat is A$AP Rocky, and he is taking home run swings at Drizzy as punishment for dissing Rocky’s relationship with his girlfriend Rihanna on a couple of songs last year called “Another Late Night” and “Fear of Heights” from his For All the Dogs album.
On the song “Show of Hands,” A$AP swipes at Drake by bringing the mother of his child, Sophie Brussaux, into the fray. 
“N—– in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or something?/I smashed before you birthed son, Flacko hit it first, son.”
As we tally up the scorecard, these two disses follow Kendrick Lamar’s scathing track aimed at Drake called “Like That” from Future and Metro Boomin’s last album. That song is still the reigning No. 1 song on Billboard. 
Drake has yet to respond to his rap contemporaries publicly or on wax. But word is that Drizzy is preparing to drop a bomb on his haters in the near future.
