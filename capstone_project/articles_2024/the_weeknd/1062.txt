Drake has caught a stray from pop rap superstar Baby Tate, who took aim at the 6 God on her new freestyle over the “BOA” beat made famous by Megan Thee Stallion.
The rapper, who is the daughter of singer Dionne Farris, revealed that she’d be releasing a new freestyle every Tuesday during the month of June to celebrate Pride month. And for her latest freestyle, which dropped on Tuesday (June 4), she took direct aim at Drake.

“I like freaky ass n-ggas, but not like Mr. Graham,” she spit. “Don’t buy Baby Tate on Temu, lot of these bitches a scam.”
Check out the full three-minute freestyle below.
Baby Tate isn’t the only one who has slapped Drizzy with jokes about his alleged sexual predilections.
On Wednesday (June 5), the Canadian rapper was nominated for a myriad of Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, including Favorite Male Artist alongside the likes of Post Malone, Travis Scott and Usher, as well as friend turned enemy The Weeknd.

While Drake has to wait until July 13 to see if he wins the award, he only has to look online to see a number of derogatory jokes being made about him relating to Kendrick Lamar‘s accusations that he’s a sex predator who preys on underage girls.
One social media commenter joked: “The KIDS CHOICE AWARDS is the last place drake needs to be.”

Another said: “WHO UP FOR THE WHAT CHOICE AWARDS!?” and posted a snippet of Kendrick’s diss track “Meet the Grahams.”
Someone else remarked: “I mean… the jokes write itself.”

A fourth user edited a photo of Nickelodeon’s studios with several red markers from a sex predator app, a nod to the artwork for K. Dot’s “Not Like Us.”
Drake vehemently denied the pedophile allegations on his response track “The Heart Part 6.”

He rapped: “I never been with no one underage but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with/ Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I’m too respected/ If I was fucking young girls, I promise I’d have been arrested/ I’m way too famous for this shit you just suggested,” he rapped, before adding: “Only fuckin’ with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I’d never look twice at no teenager.”
