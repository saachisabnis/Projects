The Weeknd‘s rumored plans to retire from music could mean a shift to his outside professional ventures. Besides his acting career, he has a thriving coffee company, Samra Origins, to dive deeper into. 
The “Blinding Lights” singer’s partnership with Blue Bottle Coffee is proof of this as it aims to celebrate his Ethiopian culture, specifically, its traditional coffee ceremony, Buna Tetu.
In a statement, The Weeknd opened up about the rich cultural significance of the beverage. “I remember coming home to the smell of coffee roasting in the kitchen and the chatter of family catching up in the living room,” he said. “The Buna Tetu coffee ceremony was a special piece of our culture my mother would share with our guests, and I realize, now that I’m older, it’s synonymous with home for me.”
He went on to add how this sense of home led to the buildout of the venture. “Samra Origins is a true passion project of mine that Blue Bottle matched and understood as we developed the products together,” he said. “I hope the result ignites curiosity about Ethiopia’s people and motivates others to give back to communities in need.”

Blue Bottle Coffee also pledged to donate to the XO Humanitarian Fund, administered by World Food Program USA. The organization works to provide emergency operations in areas of high food insecurity with an emphasis on Ethiopian aid.
