Apple is launching new “immersive” video content for the Vision Pro over the next few months, including one from The Weeknd, a close-up view of the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend, and “the first scripted short film captured in Apple Immersive Video.” The new series and film will come exclusively to the Vision Pro, allowing wearers to watch 3D video with a 180-degree field of view.
The immersive performance from The Weeknd will arrive on the Vision Pro later this year, while you can expect a short film featuring events from the NBA All-Star Game this fall, such as the Rising Stars Challenge, the slam dunk contest, and the All-Star Game.
But if you’re hoping to jump into an immersive experience sooner, you can catch Boundless, which Apple describes as “a new series that invites viewers to experience once-in-a-lifetime trips from wherever they are” at 9PM ET on July 18th. Here’s some of the other content coming to the Vision Pro:
All this adds to the immersive content Apple has already brought to the Vision Pro, including Adventure, Alicia Keys: Rehearsal Room, and Prehistoric Planet Immersive. Apple says that “more series, films, concerts, and sports captured in Apple Immersive Video will be released this year,” helped by a new Blackmagic camera, as well as updates to DaVinci Resolve Studio and Apple Compressor that are coming later.
