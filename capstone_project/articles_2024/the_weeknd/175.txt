The Pop Out: Ken and Friends was about many things — celebrating Los Angeles rap, coming together in a display of peace and unity, hating Drake. The show, produced by Amazon and streamed live on Prime and Twitch, built to a fascinating crescendo. As rappers, NBA stars, and members of L.A.’s various gangs took the stage, Kendrick performed “Not Like Us” six times in a row (well, once was just the instrumental). Here’s everything else that went down, and who put in a cameo.
Kendrick offered a Whitman’s Sampler of his Drake diss tracks. He opened the show with “Euphoria” (adding the new line “Give me Tupac’s ring back and I might give you a little respect”), performed “6:16 in LA” and “Like That,” and then closed with “Not Like Us.”

Audiences went wild when Jay Rock joined Lamar onstage for “Money Trees.” Then Ab-Soul came out. Then Schoolboy Q came out. It was a full Black Hippy reunion, with Rock and Lamar performing “King’s Dead” together for the first time since 2018.

Dr. Dre came out to Inglewood to do his songs “Still D.R.E.” and “California Love.” He also helped on the first playthrough of “Not Like Us,” kicking the song off with the “I see dead people” line. That’s gotta hurt, Drake.

Kendrick did “Not Like Us” again and again and again (and then two more again’s). After the show concluded, “SIX TIMES” was trending on Twitter. The stage got more and more crowded as the song repeated. Lamar was later joined by YG, Steve Lacy, all of Black Hippy, Big Boy, G Perico, Mustard (who you may recognize from being on the beat), L.A. Clipper Russell Westbrook, Chicago Bull Demar Derozan, krumper Tommy the Clown, and, allegedly, members of every major gang in Los Angeles. While taking the concert-ending group photo, Kendrick insisted this moment was about way more than just rap beef. He shouted out Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant, said everyone onstage has lost someone to violence, and that they were here today to represent a unified L.A. Then the “Not Like Us” instrumental came back on.

The Weeknd attended the concert as a guest, living laughing and loving the drama. And we didn’t even get into who guested on Mustard’s opening set. Tyler the Creator was onstage, as well as Roddy Ricch and YG. Who wasn’t at this show? Well, we know one guy.
