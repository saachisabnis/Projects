Taylor Swift will not be performing at the Super Bowl Halftime show in 2024. She is currently focusing on her ongoing tour and recording new music, dedicating her time and energy to these projects. This decision, despite the NFL’s repeated attempts to secure her performance for the event, mirrors the choices of other big-name artists who have also declined this prestigious opportunity for various reasons.
Despite the immense exposure and potential career boost that comes with performing at the Super Bowl Halftime show, many artists have chosen to turn down this prestigious opportunity over the years. These decisions are frequently influenced by a variety of factors, including personal beliefs, political stances, and the desire for creative control. This reflects the complex and multifaceted dynamics behind participating in such a high-profile and widely watched event.
Swift was highly anticipated to perform at Super Bowl LVIII, but she has decided to prioritize her current projects. a source told the Daily Mail,
“Taylor is busy with her current tour, she has zero time to prepare a Super Bowl show.”
The source added,
“Swift knows she is at her peak in her career and each move from this point on is as important as the next.”
Despite dating Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce, she feels it’s not the right time for her debut. Working on her tour, recording her old music, and creating new music are her main focuses right now. She has reportedly turned down opportunities to perform in both 2023 and 2024.

Several top performers have also declined the Super Bowl Halftime show, despite the potential boost to their sales and streaming numbers. In 2019, Rihanna turned down the offer in support of Colin Kaepernick. “I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler,” she told Vogue.
Cardi B shared a similar stance, feeling indebted to Kaepernick:
“There’s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.”
These artists prioritize their principles over the potential benefits of performing at the event. Jay-Z also turned down the Super Bowl Halftime show due to the NFL’s desire to control his performance.
Jay-Z was asked to perform Run This Town with Kanye West and Rihanna but refused due to the conditional nature of the offer. “I said, ‘No, you get me,'” he told The New York Times. Outkast missed out on the 2004 Super Bowl Halftime show because they couldn’t agree on the setlist. Big Boi revealed that creative differences with Andre 3000 prevented them from accepting the invitation.
Pink declined the 2019 Super Bowl Halftime show to support Colin Kaepernick, even though she had previously performed the National Anthem in 2018. In an interview with Billboard, emphasizing her solidarity with Kaepernick’s protest against police brutality, she said:
“I’d probably take a knee and get carried out.”
This decision underscores how political and social issues significantly influence the choices and actions of many artists in the industry.

Performers at the Super Bowl Halftime show do not receive a direct paycheck, but the NFL covers all expenses, including the union scale payment for artists. Production costs can reach up to $13 million, with The Weeknd spending $7 million of his own money in 2021. Despite not being paid immediately, artists often benefit from a significant boost in streaming numbers and endorsement deals.
Even criticized performances can lead to financial gains, as seen with Adam Levine and Maroon Five. The exposure often results in increased sales and streaming, making it a lucrative opportunity. However, many artists, including Taylor Swift, prioritize their principles, creative control, and current commitments over these potential benefits.
