"Need this?" wrote the actress in an Instagram story, responding to the rapper's recent post
Uma Thurman has offered Drake her iconic yellow suit from Kill Bill amid his current feud with his Hip-hop colleagues.
The ‘God’s Plan’ rapper has found himself in the middle of a feud involving Rick Ross, Kendrick Lamar and others. Over the weekend, a rumoured Drake diss track against Lamar called ‘Push Up’ leaked online.
The diss is a response to Lamar’s verse aimed at him and J. Cole on the song ‘Like That’, which was released as part of Metro Boomin and Future’s first collaborative album ‘We Don’t Trust You‘ last month.
On Sunday (April 14), Drake took to his Instagram stories to share a still from Quentin Tarantino’s 2003 film Kill Bill: Volume 1, seemingly comparing his feud to Thurman’s character of The Bride surrounded by multiple armed assailants.

Thurman took to her Instagram stories to share a photo of her character’s iconic yellow suit in her closet, protected by a plastic covering with the caption: “Need this?” to which the rapper responded: “Yes pls. The pen is Hattori Hanzō,” in a repost, comparing his lyrics to the famed samurai.
Drake’s leaked diss track contained shots referencing Lamar (“How the fuck you big steppin’ with a size seven men’s on?”), along with Metro Boomin (“Metro, shut your ho-ass up and make some drums”), The Weeknd (“Cash blowin’ Abel bread, out here trickin’”) and more.
There were doubts over the veracity of the track, with fans suspecting it to be the work of AI.
However, Drake confirmed the diss track was real. Taking to social media, the rapper posted an Instagram story with a clip of Metro Boomin playing some drums superimposed onto the 2002 movie Drumline. The clip is intended to reference his Metro diss in his own song.
In other news, 50 Cent has reacted to Cole apologising to Lamar at this year’s Dreamville Festival, telling the rapper to “call [his] phone”.
