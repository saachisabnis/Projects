UPDATE (APRIL 15): 
Two days after Rick Ross unleashed his diss track firing off at Drake, the Biggest Boss has made it official by releasing the song "Champagne Moments" on streaming platforms today (April 15). The diss sounds just like the original drop from this past Saturday (April 13). Producer MiniBoom cooked up the beat.
For the cover art, Ross includes an old yearbook photo of a man who looks eerily similar to Drake. "#BBLDRIZZY" is included as a hashtag on the artwork.
Listen to the full song included at the bottom of this post.
ORIGINAL STORY (APRIL 13):
Within hours of a Drake diss track leaking that finds him sending shots at Kendrick Lamar and others, Rick Ross drops his response track to Drizzy called "Champagne Moments."
On Saturday (April 13), Rick Ross delivered "Champagne Moments," an ominous response track to Drake. The song, which can be heard below, is in direct response to Drizzy's blistering diss track, in which he took lyrical shots at not only Ross but Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin and The Weeknd.
On the outro, Ross revealed an uncorroborated secret that Drake got a nose job because he didn't want to have the same nose as his dad. The Miami rhymer added that he unfollowed Drake on Instagram because Drizzy allegedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to French Montana.
"You ain't never wanted to be a n***a anyway, n***a, that's why you had a operation that make your nose look smaller than your father nose, n***a," Ross rambles. "I unfollowed you, n***a, 'cause you sent a muthaf****n' cease-and-desist to French Montana, n***a."
Then, over a pounding beat and violins, Ross lyrically insults Drake by calling him a "White boy" and alluding to him using ghostwriters. He also clowned Drizzy for leaking the diss track and not stepping to Ross like a man if he had an issue with him.
"N***as leakin' their records when we speakin' directly/If we keepin' it gangsta, when you see me, you check me," Ross raps on the song.
Rick Ross' response comes after Drake's initial diss track was leaked onto social media. On the song, Drizzy slammed Rozay for jumping into his rap battle with K-Dot, Future and Young Metro.
"I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I'm Ricky/Can't believe he jumpin' in, this n***a turnin' 50/Every song that made it on the chart, he got from Drizzy/Worry 'bout whatever goin' on with you and 'Huh!'"
Before dropping his response track, Ross hopped on X, formerly known as Twitter, and wrote, "It's the 1st qtr, This gone be a good game. Grab a seat," and added, "Perfect day to boss up."
Ross also posted a video on his Instagram Stories of himself gleefully laughing. And now it's clear why.
