“The one thing I learned from this situation is that rap is just better when all 3 are outside. They all the pinnacle of what this shit is supposed to be. It’s just better that way,” he wrote.
The message follows the recent exchange of iconic verses by Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and J. Cole, each discussing their positions at the top of the rap game.
On Friday (March 22), K.Dot shook up the rap scene with a new verse on Future and Metro Boomin‘s latest collaborative album We Don’t Trust You.
The former TDE rapper fires off several shots in his verse, starting strong with a reference to Drizzy and Cole’s No. 1 single “First Person Shooter,” accusing the pair of “sneak dissin’.”

“Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches,” he raps.
Kendrick Lamar then directly references “the big three,” which is commonly known as himself, Drake and J. Cole, claiming it’s only him at the top of the rap chain.

He also compares himself to Prince and the others to Michael Jackson, suggesting his work will outlive that of both his peers.
“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum, what? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack’,” he spits.

Kenny wraps it up by nodding Drake’s 2023 album For All the Dogs and Stephen King’s classic 1983 novel Pet Sematary.
“N-gga, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary,” he raps.

In October, J. Cole mentioned Kendrick Lamar’s name and “the big three” on “First Person Shooter,” but took the crown by comparing himself to the late, great Muhammad Ali.
“Love when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali,” he rapped.

On the other hand, Drake shaded Kendrick by stating it’s just him and Cole who hold the “greatest of all time” title.
“Who the G.O.A.T.? Who you bitches really rooting for?/ Like a kid that act bad from January to November, n-gga, it’s just you and Cole,” he said.
