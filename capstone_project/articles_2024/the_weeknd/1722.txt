Cocteau Twins have announced a new vinyl reissue of The Moon and the Melodies, their 1986 collaboration with Harold Budd. The album, which is available August 23 via 4AD, has been remastered from the original tapes by the band’s Robin Guthrie. It is the first time the album will be available on vinyl since its release.
Cocteau Twins have also launched a new YouTube channel, which collects high resolution tape transfers of all of their official music videos for the first time. The library includes clips for songs such as “Pearly Dewdrops’ Drops,” “Heaven or Las Vegas,” “Evangeline,” and more, upgraded using original masters found in both 4AD and Universal Music’s vaults. The band has also launched a new official merch store to coincide with the news.
Earlier this year, Cocteau Twins reissued their final two albums, 1994’s Four-Calendar Café and 1996’s Milk & Kisses. The re-releases followed similar reissues of their previous albums over the years, including Treasure, Head Over Heels, Garlands, and Victoria.
