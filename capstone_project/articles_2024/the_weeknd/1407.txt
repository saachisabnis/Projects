	Embarrassing a world-renowned fashion designer and former popstar isn’t easy, but Victoria Beckham’s kids were committed. They enlisted the help of their dad David Beckham to prank their mom with a viral TikTok trend, and we can’t stop laughing at the funny moment.

	










	The former professional soccer player shared a video of the prank on Instagram on Wednesday, featuring their kids 13-year-old Harper and 21-year-old Romeo. The phone is propped up on the floor pointed up to the family, as each person takes turns singing into the mic: “Give me my money!” Romeo goes first, followed by a friend, then David, then Harper. After each person leans in and sings the line, the rest of the family claps and cheers for them.

	Victoria is the last to go, and as a former Spice Girl, her vocals are amazing. She leans in to sing the line, clapping as soon as she finished. She turns back to look at her family, and they are dead silent. No one claps, no one cheers, no one says a word. They all stare at her or at the camera, with Harper covering her mouth with her hand clearly trying not to laugh. That would be so confusing, wondering if you did something wrong because no one was clapping. A second later, everyone burst into laughter. “What was that?” Victoria asked her family.



	“Is that it?” she asks, as Harper falls to the ground laughing. She finally got that the prank was to purposely not clap for the last person and embarrass them. Someone replies, “that’s it” with a laugh. Posh Spice knew she’d been got, and she handled it with grace. Seriously, what a queen!

	“😆 sorry Mum 😆 @victoriabeckham @romeobeckham #HarperSeven 😆,” David captioned the post. He tagged his other sons, Brooklyn, 25, and Cruz, 19, adding, “@brooklynpeltzbeckham @cruzbeckham we got mum 😆.”

	People shared their love of this lighthearted fun in the comments. “The irony is not lost on us. We all realize that Mom is the only actual singer in the family. 🙂” one person commented. Someone else wrote, “Nooo poor Victoria 🙈 She even had the best tuning 👏🏼👏🏼”


	“I love this family! So funny and genuine ❤️🙌” someone else wrote.

	The Beckhams have a great sense of humor and seem to enjoy messing with each other. Like when David took Harper to The Weeknd’s concert. They had a fun night, with David embarrassing his daughter with his dancing. “I know I posted one video but our little girl is so cute I had to post another cause she is mocking the dad dance whilst being so cute @victoriabeckham 😂 #HarperSeven ❤️ @theweeknd 💙,” he captioned the video showing Harper cheekily imitating her dad’s dance. All you can do is laugh, right?

	Despite the gentle ribbing, David and Victoria love their kids. The couple recently celebrated their 25th anniversary with their family, and it made them appreciate their children. “We woke up this morning and said, ‘We’re so proud of the kids, they’re such great, kind, sweet, humble, funny, hardworking young adults,’” she told Vogue Australia.

	She’s also excited about this next phase of parenthood, where her kids are adults (or getting close). “Now myself and David are in the next chapter,” she said. “Even Harper, who is 13, has her friendship group, she loves to do her own thing, and we’re super, super close but it definitely feels like that next chapter of our lives together.”

	But even when all the kids move out, you can already tell this family is going to stay close.
Celebrities — they’re just like us! Especially when it comes toembarrassing their kids.
