It’s an exciting week for The Weeknd’s fans following the Grammy Award winner’s announcement of his forthcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow. This new release will follow his fifth studio LP, Dawn FM.
On Wednesday (September 4), the Canada-born artist took to YouTube and social media to share a cryptic message: “Yesterday was 14 years ago. We held our breath, falling into a shimmering sea in the after-hours of the night. Attempted to cleanse the wounds with melodies and lights, a bulletproof bandage to shield what lies beneath.”
He continued, “In a place where the seasons never changed, where time ceased to exist. But therein lies the problem. Today has felt like an endless spin. I keep distorting the truth, immune to the dizziness, numb to the nausea. What lies beneath – screams in silence.”

The Weeknd concluded his message with, “I look in the mirror and feel both old and new, stuck in limbo and unable to move. I still haven’t faced myself. More songs could help, but what do I have left to say? Woe is me in my gilded cage, right? The very thing that once made me invincible failed me on the world stage. A new trauma surfaced, opening floodgates. A new path awaits. When today ends, I’ll discover who I am.”
Though a release date has yet to be announced, Hurry Up Tomorrow will be the grand finale of The Weeknd’s trilogy, which began in 2020 with After Hours.
