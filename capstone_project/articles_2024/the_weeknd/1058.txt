The Weeknd has finally let the world know when Tomorrow really is, by announcing the release date for his upcoming album.
Hurry Up Tomorrow will be out on January 24, 2025, the singer announced on Wednesday (November 27). To celebrate, he will be putting on a “massive one-night-only live stadium show” at Pasadena, California’s famed Rose Bowl Stadium on the day after the album drops.

The show will, per a press release, be a “never-before-seen production” so massive that the stage will take over the whole stadium floor. Tickets will be available starting Monday, December 2 at 10am PST at TheWeeknd.com.
In addition, die-hard fans can visit XO.STORE to pre-order exclusive vinyl, box sets, and signed CDs — including a version of the new album artwork designed by legendary comic book artist Frank Miller.

The album will have a tie-in movie, a “psychological thriller” also titled Hurry Up Tomorrow that recently landed a distribution deal that will put the film into theaters worldwide.
According to a press release circulated at the beginning of this month, Lionsgate has secured the rights to the movie, which serves as an extension of the Toronto crooner’s forthcoming album of the same name.
