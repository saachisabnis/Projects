A security guard was in the hospital Monday morning, April 29, after getting shot outside a home in the Amestoy Estates area of Encino.
The shooting occurred at 2:25 a.m. in the 17500 block of Jayden Lane, said Los Angeles police Officer A. Delatorre.
The home, south of the 101 Freeway and west of Encino Avenue, is owned by Amir Esmailian, a music executive and producer, according to media reports.
The security guard heard gunshots and realized he was wounded, Delatorre said. Paramedics took the 37-year-old man to a hospital.
He underwent surgery and was expected to survive, according to reports from Fox 11.
The suspects who ran away were described as three males, Delatorre said.
The house is listed for sale for $12 million. According to Zillow it has seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and is “equipped with a state-of-the-art security system.”
Esmailian is a talent manager, record producer and co-founder of XO Records, KTLA reported. He is also co-manager of the label’s primary artist, The Weeknd.
