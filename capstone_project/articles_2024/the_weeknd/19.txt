During an Instagram Live session on Sunday, 21 Savage spoke up about the ongoing chatter surrounding his longtime collaborators, Drake and Metro Boomin. 
He made it clear he’s tired of folks poking around about any tension between them, emphasizing they’ll patch things up in due time.
“Stop buggin’ me about that drama,” Savage stated firmly. “Metro’s my brother, Drake’s my brother. They’ll sort it out eventually.”

Metro and Drake made their beef public after this year’s Grammys, which resulted in the producer dropping a joint album with Future that targeted Drake, entitled We Don’t Trust You. A part of a trilogy, the album features The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, and Kendrick Lamar.  
21 Savage and Metro have worked together frequently, and 21 has a history with Drake as well, which includes their 2023 joint track and tour Her Loss. Previous Drake and Metro Boomin’ collaborations are hit songs “Mr. Right Now” and “Knife Talk.”
21 came to the aid of Metro Boomin’ over the weekend when Soulja Boy threatened Metro to remove old tweets mentioning his name. Soulja wasn’t thrilled about being compared to Jeezy in that tweet from back in the day. He went off, calling Metro out for the comparison, calling him names, and even tossing out a warning.
“Hey, Metro Groomin’, what’s with the Jeezy studio hype, huh? You think you’re all that?” Soulja snapped. “Back in ’07, I was already topping charts when I was just 17. You were still in middle school, kiddo.”
21 Savage commented under Soulja’s video threatening Metro with, “Or what?” 
Soulja reacted to 21 Savage’s question by lashing out and referring to 21 as a “British rapper.”
