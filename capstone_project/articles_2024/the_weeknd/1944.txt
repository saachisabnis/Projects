Future and Metro Boomin are looking to heat up the summer, as the rapper-producer duo will be hitting the road in support of their pair of albums.

	Live Nation announced the We Trust You Tour on Tuesday (April 16), and the arena trek is slated to kick off in Kansas City, Mo., at the T-Mobile Center on July 30. Openers and supporting acts have not yet been announced.

	Metro Boomin and Future’s 27-date North American tour will be making stops in Detroit, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Boston, Philly, Houston, Toronto, Las Vegas, Seattle and more before wrapping up north of the border on Sept. 9 in Vancouver, B.C., at Rogers Arena.

	Tickets will be available to Cash App Card customers starting on Wednesday (April 17), while the general public will get their chance on Friday (April 19) on the Live Nation website at 10 a.m. local venue time.

	VIP packages are also available for those interested in a package that will include a photo-op in front of the stage, access to a VIP lounge, a VIP gift item and more perks. Cash App Card members will also receive discounts on tour merchandise purchased on-site at venues.

	Future and Metro sprinted out of the gates with their We Don’t Trust You album in March, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 251,000 total album-equivalent units in the week ending March 28, per Luminate.

	Album standout “Like That” featuring Kendrick Lamar’s atomic bomb on the rap game is spending a third week atop the Billboard Hot 100. The fiery track soared to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and is the first rap song to spend its first three weeks at the summit since Drake’s “Nice for What.”

	“HIP HOP IS ALIVE AND WELL #WEDONTTRUSTYOU,” Metro wrote on social media after learning “Like That” had notched him his first No. 1 hit as a billed artist. (He previously reached the summit as a co-producer and co-writer on Migos’ “Bad & Boujee” and The Weeknd’s “Heartless.”)

	The duo could be making yet another splash on the charts as Pluto and Young Metro returned to give fans 25 more tracks packaged as another album, fittingly titled We Still Don’t Trust You.
