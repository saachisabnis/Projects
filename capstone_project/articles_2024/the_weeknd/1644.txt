If anything, putting him 8th is too generous
No list has caused quite as much furore and debate this year than Billboard ranking its greatest pop stars of the 21st century. With only 25 on its shortlist, and the publication releasing it in drips and drabs, the anticipation for whoever might crop up next has been the talk of the Twitter town. Beyond a few major snubs, notably for me Lana Del Rey, it’s honestly quite a fair and considered ranking. But one person who is not happy with it is Hailey Bieber, who has lashed out at Billboard for having ranked her fella Justin Bieber as the 8th best pop star of the 21st century. Most people would clearly wow at this being quite an achievement, but not our Hailey.

In a comment on Billboard’s announcement of where they ranked Justin Bieber, Hailey commented “Billboard is a f*cking joke as per usual”. Quite a hilarious response to what is literally a top 10 ranking of every music artist of the last 25 years so far. Let’s get serious!
And to put it further into context, this reaction comes after Justin Bieber was ranked higher than Adele, Ariana Grande, Eminem, Jay-Z and The Weeknd. And he made the cut OVER Lana Del Rey, but we won’t bring that up again.
And even funnier still thinking about who is ranked higher than him. Billboard hasn’t released the top two yet – widely predicted to be Beyoncé and Taylor Swift – but the five above Bieber are Kanye West, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Drake and Rihanna. Which of these artists does Hailey Bieber think Billboard are a “f*cking joke” for declaring as bigger and more influential than her husband?
It’s beyond belief. Funny though. Keep fuming, queen.
