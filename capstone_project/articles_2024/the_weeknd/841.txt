The Weeknd has announced plans for a one-night-only performance at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Saturday, Jan. 25, 2025.
The show will coincide with the release of his highly anticipated album, “Hurry Up Tomorrow”, set to drop just a day earlier on Jan. 24 via XO and Republic Records. The album marks the final chapter of his trilogy, following 2020’s “After Hours” and 2022’s “Dawn FM”.
According to a press release, the performance will feature groundbreaking production and a custom-designed stage that will take over the entire stadium floor, promising a one-of-a-kind, in-the-round experience.
