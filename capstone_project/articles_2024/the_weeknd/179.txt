The French duo will bring their headline live show in support of 'Hyperdrama' — their first album in eight years — to the UK for the first time
Justice have revealed their first headline UK concert date since the release of their latest album, 'Hyperdrama'. 
The French duo will play London's storied Alexandra Palace on Wednesday, 12th February, 2025. Following a run of UK festival performances this past summer, Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay will bring their latest live show in support of the 13-track April LP — their first in eight years — which featured Miguel, Thundercat, The Flints, Rimon and Connan Mockasin.
Thundercat is among the artists supporting Justice on their ongoing North American live tour, but there's no word yet on UK or European tour guest acts in the lead up to the London show. 
In addition to their tour and festival schedule, which included a set at Coachella and Glastonbury, Justice have had a busy 2024. They started the year teasing their comeback LP and tour, plus a collaboration with The Weeknd. Ahead of 'Hyperdrama''s release, they released singles for 'Generator', 'Incognito', 'One Night/All Night' and 'Saturnine', as well as a remix EP with Tame Impala for their single 'Neverender' featuring Kaytranada and Rampa. 
Justice's music recently featured in the Paris Olympics 2024 closing ceremony and on the soundtrack to the latest instalment in the FIFA football gaming franchise, EA Sports FC 25, out now.
