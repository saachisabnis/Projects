Selena is a lucky girl
Benny Blanco just proposed to Selena Gomez with a massive rock and it’s got everyone wondering how rich he is.
She announced that they got engaged with a super cute Instagram post captioned: “Forever begins now.”
The singer shared pics of the romantic picnic where he got down on one knee and close-ups of the dazzling gem.
It looks like a four-carat diamond which is estimated to be worth $200k – but that has nothing on his net worth.
So, how much is Benny Blanco worth? And how did he get his money? Here’s everything you need to know.

The 36-year-old has a net worth of $50 million according to Celebrity Net Worth.
This has been accumulated through his career as a songwriter, producer, and musician.
That seems like nothing compared to Selena Gomez’s $1 billion net worth, but he’s actually very successful.
Most of his money was made through writing and producing songs for some of the world’s biggest artists.
Some of them include Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Avicii, Maroon 5, Eminem, The Weeknd, Ariana Grande, SZA and Britney Spears.
His biggest tracks are Rihanna’s Diamonds, Wiz Khalifa and Maroon 5’s Payphone, Taio Cruz’s Dynamite, and Katy Perry’s I Kissed A Girl.
Benny has won the BMI Songwriter of the Year Award five times and got the 2013 Hal Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

After writing songs for decades, he released his own debut single Eastside in 2018 which shot right up to number ten on the Billboard Hot 100.
His debut studio album Friends Keep Secrets was then released in December of that year, followed by a deluxe version in March 2021.
On top of all that, Benny also founded two record labels Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets in 2014, which signed Tory Lanez and Jessie Ware.
Both of them were closed in 2024, but the producer does still own A&M Records, which is part of Universal Music Group.
