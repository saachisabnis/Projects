Lights illuminate the Hollywood sign during Universal Studios Hollywood’s Halloween Horror Nights, Universal City, California, October 2024. 
Universal Studios Hollywood’s Halloween Horror Nights, happening now through Nov. 3, is a must see and do for horror fans looking for an immersive, heart-pounding experience.
This annual event at the California resort transforms the park into a playground of fear, combining iconic movie sets, cutting-edge haunted houses and eerie atmospheres that feel straight out of a Hollywood horror film. From the moment you step onto the property, you're greeted by a festival of frights — perfect for thrill-seekers and fans of everything spooky. Universal Studios goes all-in on creating a night of terror.
Arrival and ticketing
Arriving at Halloween Horror Nights is smooth and hassle-free. We stayed a few miles away at the Marriott Courtyard and used a rideshare to drop us off at CityWalk, Universal’s vibrant entertainment district. With great shopping and dining options, I wish I had a little more time to explore before heading into the park, but as I like to say, you always need to leave something for next time. After the event, we used rideshare again, with a short walk to the Frankenstein Lot for pick-up.

For those driving their own vehicles, paid parking is convenient and priced similarly to other theme parks. I appreciated the pricing breaks (before and after 5 p.m.) for early and late arrivals — especially during specialty events like Halloween Horror Nights.
Early access and ride experience
Early access is a game-changer. It allowed us to enjoy some of Universal Studios’ top rides before the horror began. We rode “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey,” “Jurassic World – The Ride,” and experienced the immersive world of “Mario Kart: Bowser’s Challenge” located in Super Nintendo World — a major highlight for me.
Getting in early gave us the best of both worlds: We enjoyed the park’s attractions before diving into the main event once the sun went down for the 7 p.m. start.
A night built on horror
The energy at Halloween Horror Nights is electric. The music, atmosphere and overall Halloween vibe are fantastic — but make no mistake, this event is built on genuine horror. Unlike the family-friendly Oogie Boogie’s Bash or Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Parties at Disney parks, Halloween Horror Nights is geared toward those who love Hollywood-level scares.

The event is intense, graphic and not for the faint of heart. I would recommend it for ages 16 and up. Some younger kids were present, but from their reactions, it seemed like the adults were having a much better time.
Exceptional staff and service
One of the standout aspects of Halloween Horror Nights is the service staff. Extra personnel are on hand to guide crowds, answer questions and handle everything from directions to general information.
Considering the event moves you through the park’s attractions, sound stages and even movie sets, it is impressively organized.
Front-of-the-line perks
We opted for the Universal Express option, and it made a world of difference. This pass allows visitors to bypass long lines, giving access to all the major rides and all eight haunted houses with minimal wait times. For instance, while we waited 12 minutes for “Insidious: The Further,” the general admission line was over 75 minutes long.
If you're short on time or want to maximize your experience, I highly recommend investing in the Express Pass.
Immersive horror attractions

Universal goes all out after dark. From the haunting music to the detailed food stands, every corner of the park immerses you in the world of Halloween, including the food. We stopped by Leatherface’s BBQ, where we devoured ribs, a brisket sandwich and a 22-inch chili cheese hot dog. For dessert, we couldn’t resist the “Stay Puft Marshmallow S’mores.” The themed food adds a fun touch to the entire experience.
The Terror Tram and iconic sets
Arriving before the event started allowed us to do one of my favorite Universal Hollywood pastimes, the Hollywood Studio back lot bus tour, which this year is celebrating its 60-year anniversary.
After 7 p.m., the tour transforms into the Terror Tram and takes you on a walking tour through the haunted worlds of horror films from Blumhouse Studios. This part is a great mix of live actors and some of Universal’s spookiest movie sets, like the airplane crash site from "The War of the Worlds." This version of the tour allows you to be steps away from some of the most iconic sets, including Norman Bates home from the OG of Hollywood Horror Alfred Hitchcock’s masterpiece, “Psycho.”

The Haunts
Halloween Horror Nights features eight unique haunted houses, each with its own theme. Whether you’re a fan of classic horror or more modern scares, there’s something for everyone. The lineup includes:
Of the eight, “Eternal Bloodlines” stood out to me for its setting inside the historic “Stage 12,” one of Hollywood’s largest sound stages, where blockbusters like “Back to the Future,” “Scarface,” “Jurassic Park” and all the way back to “Dracula” and “Frankenstein” were filmed. Walking through this haunt, surrounded by cinematic history, is a unique experience. Our group also rated it as having the best music.

If you're looking for the scariest experience, “Insidious: The Further” takes the crown. With its unsettling atmosphere and nail-biting moments, it left everyone in our group on edge. “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” came in a close second for sheer terror -- and smells (sorry, no spoilers).
Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood is a masterclass in immersive horror. From the expertly designed haunted houses to the electrifying atmosphere throughout the park, it offers an experience that stays with you. It’s more than just scares — it's about stepping into worlds where horror comes alive.
If you're looking for a night that challenges your senses and pushes the boundaries of entertainment, this event delivers in every way.
