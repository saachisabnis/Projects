Even Benny Blanco is seemingly gobsmacked about his white hot romance with Selena Gomez.
The 36-year-old music producer opened about his relationship with the “Only Murders in the Building” star during Wednesday’s episode of the “Today” show.
“I wake up every day and I look in the mirror and I’m like, ‘How did this happen?”” he told co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager about dating Gomez.
Blanco, born Benjamin Levin, is doing the media rounds to promote his cookbook, “Open Wide.” He revealed his cooking skills helped him land the 31-year-old beauty.
“Look at me, the only way I got where I am is cooking food,” the “Eastside” musician said. “Are you kidding me? That’s the best first date in the world. You cook up some food. How can anyone not love you if you’re making them a huge steak with potatoes and salad.”
Gomez — previously romantically linked to Justin Bieber, Charlie Puth, The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggart and Zayn Malik — seems to be all-in with her new boo. During a soiree celebrating the release of “Open Wide” on Tuesday, she took the title literally when she licked the crotch area of a cake that was made to replicate the book.
The “Heart Wants What It Wants” singer shared the suggestive image to her 428 million Instagram followers, with the caption: “So proud of @itsbennyblanco – Open Wide is out now!!”
“Life is better when i’m w u,” Blanco replied.
After sparking rumors of a romance last summer, Gomez confirmed in December the two were dating, after collaborating on her song “Single Soon.”
Sharing a photo in which she sported a “B” ring on her left ring finger, she called Blanco “the best thing that’s ever happened to me” and said she’s the “happiest” she’s ever been.
