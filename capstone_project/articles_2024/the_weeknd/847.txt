	Here’s a look at all of 21 Savage’s entries (includes two previously-charting songs) on the latest Hot 100.

	










21 Savage on the Jan. 27, 2024-dated Hot 100:Rank, TitleNo. 5, “Redrum”No. 10, “Née-nah,” with Travis Scott & Metro BoominNo. 18, “All of Me”No. 19, “N.H.I.E.,” with Doja CatNo. 31, “Pop Ur Sht,” with Young Thug & Metro BoominNo. 33, “Sneaky”No. 35, “Dangerous,” with Lil Durk & Metro BoominNo. 40, “Should’ve Wore a Bonnet,” with Brent FaiyazNo. 43, “Prove It,” with Summer WalkerNo. 48, “Good Good,” with Usher & Summer Walker (down from No. 34, after hitting No. 25)No. 50, “Surround Sound” (JID featuring 21 Savage & Baby Tate) (down from No. 40 peak)No. 57, “Red Sky,” with Tommy Newport & Mikky EkkoNo. 59, “Letter to My Brudda”No. 66, “See the Real”No. 67, “Just Like Me,” with Burna Boy & Metro BoominNo. 70, “Dark Days,” with Mariah The Scientist

	Thanks to his appearance on “Red Sky,” Tommy Newport scores his first entry on not just the Hot 100, but any Billboard chart. Mikky Ekko, also on the song, returns to the Hot 100 for the first time as a recording artist since his featured appearance on Rihanna’s “Stay” in 2013., Ekko co-wrote “Stay” – as well as Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which holds at its No. 8 high a week after reaching the top 10.

	With 103 total Hot 100 entries, 21 Savage passes The Weeknd (98), Eminem (96), Bad Bunny (93), Young Thug (93) and James Brown (91) for the 16th-most career hits.

	Here’s an updated look at every act that has charted 100 or more Hot 100 entries.

Most Career Billboard Hot 100 Hits (through Jan. 27, 2024):328, Drake232, Taylor Swift207, Glee Cast186, Lil Wayne168, Future147, Nicki Minaj141, Kanye West138, Lil Baby116, Chris Brown113, Travis Scott109, Elvis Presley (whose career predates the Hot 100’s inception)108, Lil Uzi Vert105, Justin Bieber105, Jay-Z104, YoungBoy Never Broke Again103, 21 Savage

	Of 21 Savage’s 103 total songs to have made the Hot 100, 53 have reached the top 40; 17 have hit the top 10; and two, via featured roles, hit No. 1: Post Malone’s “Rockstar” (2017) and Drake’s “Jimmy Cooks” (2022).

	










	Before 21 Savage, the last artist to join the 100 Hot 100 hits club was Travis Scott, last August after releasing his album Utopia. Two other acts achieved the feat in 2023: Lil Uzi Vert in July, and YoungBoy Never Broke Again in May.

	While it’s rare for artists to chart triple-digit entries on the Hot 100, it has become a more regular occurrence since the ranking began including streaming figures in 2007. As such, some artists have been able to chart a high number of songs on the Hot 100 after releasing high-profile albums. The model contrasts with prior decades, when acts generally promoted one single at a time in the physical-only marketplace and on radio. That shift in consumption helps explain why artists have been able to chart many songs over short spans in recent years.
