Graham Riley, the twenty-two-year-old prodigy hailing from West Hollywood, California, shares his latest track titled "Lucid", an exploration of the tumultuous intersection between mental clarity and physical consequence.
From a tender age, Riley exhibited an innate passion for music, kickstarting his musical journey at the age of three under the tutelage of Margie Balter. His remarkable talents earned him appearances on renowned platforms such as the Ellen DeGeneres Show at five and the Oprah Winfrey Show at six, showcasing his extraordinary abilities to captivate audiences with his musical prowess.
Riley's evolution as an artist has been nothing short of remarkable, with his early immersion in history seamlessly intertwining with his burgeoning interest in music. By the age of ten, he delved into the realm of long-form pop music, penning an impressive repertoire of fifty to one-hundred songs over the subsequent five years. Drawing inspiration from a diverse array of artists, including Kid Cudi, The Weeknd, Hiatus Kaiyote, Daniel Johnston, and more recently, King Krule, Riley's eclectic style infuses innovation and authenticity into his sound.
His latest release, "Lucid", serves as a raw reflection of the artist’s personal experiences, delving into a moment of profound introspection amidst the throes of nicotine withdrawal. Inspired by a pivotal moment during a vacation in Mexico with his ex-girlfriend, where they attempted to quit smoking due to running out of cigarettes, the track encapsulates the dichotomy between mental clarity and physical distress.  As Riley eloquently articulates, "It doesn't matter, indifferent to it all," echoing the profound sense of existential indifference intertwined with moments of clarity.
Produced by Max Beck, and inspired by Steve Lacy's "Gemini Rights", Max and Graham sought to create a bright and bouncy pop track. Over two days of intensive sessions, the pair meticulously crafted the track, weaving together intricate guitar loops and sampling elements from Herbie Hancock's "Watermelon Man" to create a dynamic musical landscape.
With poignant lyrics encapsulating the turmoil of battling internal contradictions, "Lucid" is sure to resonate with fans with its raw emotional depth and infectious melodies.
