	A security guard was shot several times outside the Los Angeles-area home of Weeknd co-manager and business partner Amir “Cash” Esmailian in an apparent home invasion, according to Fox11.

	Esmailian has been a key member of the team around the Weeknd, which is led by his longtime manager Wassim “Sal” Slaiby’s SalXCo, for more than 20 years and founded XO Records with the artist. He played a major role in bringing both the Weeknd and Canadian rapper Nav into the company and is deeply involved in the company’s dealmaking and promotion.
