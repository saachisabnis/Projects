Spotify is currently under fire after several users reported seeing explicit lyrics even after enabling the platform's content filter.
BBC earlier spotted that the platform still displays racial slurs, profanity, and suggestive words despite users picking to play the "radio friendly" version.
Explicit songs from Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodrigo, The Weeknd, Drake, and more with little to no changes with the safe version still show mature words.
Many of the songs in Billboard's Top 50 and Top 100 are rated as explicit content. Spotify declined to make a comment but has been reported to be working to fix the issue.
Spotify first launched the content filter in 2018 following demands from parents of the platform exposing children to mature content.
It is worth noting that Spotify currently does not allow users under the age of 18 to use its platform and services.

It is uncertain when issues in Spotify's content filters exactly started.
However, reports of increased system errors followed after the company announced that it would depend more on AI for its platform operations.
The announcement comes as Spotify conducted layoffs affecting 1,500 employees, or 17% of its staff, to reduce costs amid slow growth in the past years.
The Verge previously reported of many users getting 500 error messages when accessing the Spotify Wrapped, the platform's biggest year-end event.
Technical issues have also been more common in the Spotify app on iOS, particularly the app crashing several times.
Accessing the app via the iOS widget can also sometimes cause an error message to pop up saying, "can't open link."
Spotify said has since fixed the problems, although it took some time before the remedy dropped.
