Fifteen years ago two brothers (Sam Nelson Harris and Casey Harris) and a friend (Adam Levin) in Ithaca, N.Y. formed X Ambassadors, establishing themselves as successful “Renegades” in the community, and in the realm of alt.rock.
The troupe’s major label debut, “VHS,” went platinum in 2015 and spawned the hits “Unsteady, “Jungle” and “Renegades.” Since then X Ambassadors has released three more of its own albums — including last month’s “Townie” — and launched (Eg), a collaborative project with developing artists. Sam Harris released a solo album last year, and the band has also collaborated on tracks for Lizzo, Rihanna, Eminem, the Weeknd, SZA, Illenium, Tom Morello and others.
The career has taken them far and wide, but for “Townie” the trio returned to its Ithaca roots, creating an album rich in memory and sentiment — and also triumph, given all X Ambassadors has accomplished during the past decade and a half…
* After 2021’s highly conceptual “The Beautiful Liar” album, Sam Harris says by phone that X Ambassadors “wanted to swing the pendulum the other way and do something that was a bit more grounded for myself as a lyricist. I think as a band, too, I wanted to bring us back to the basement we started in and just get on some instruments and play.” He adds that the passing of one of his teachers also “drew my mind back there. I wanted to write something about him and my town, and that idea kept getting bigger and bigger.”
* Harris adds that writing songs for “Townie” also sharpened his perspective on Ithaca, and himself. “It was the idea of how has this place that I come from, that I fought so hard to get away from, why am I still thinking about it all the time, and how has it shaped me? And it shaped me in so many ways. So much of what happened to me growing up in that town is integrated into my daily life. I wanted to be a rock star lead singer of a band because I grew up in a small town; I wanted to go big because I grew up small. I still have that feeling everywhere I go. I’m still the underdog, and I get that from growing up where I did, and I’m very proud of that chip on my shoulder, which I now love. I got that from growing up there.”
* Harris says he feels “some definite imposter syndrome” about the work he and the band have done with other artists, but he’s proud of those experiences, too. “A lot of these things kind of came about through other folks in the industry, like a friend of a friend kind of thing. We really have worked with some crazy folks; some of them we didn’t even work with directly. Some of them I’ve never met — we’ve just exchanged files over the Internet. But some of them I know very well know and we’ve become friends outside of writing. That’s honestly been the best part. The credits are the credits; they’re cool, but I prefer when I’m really able to connect with an artist on a human level and get to know what they want and have an idea of what they need and make new friends.”
* Harris says that as X Ambassadors turns 15 things feel “not too different than it did when I was 14 in my basement writing songs for the first time. At the same time there are moments where you realize you feel so comfortable in front of a large group of people, talking, singing, whatever it is. That’s pretty insane to learn and realize. It’s been an incredible journey so far. I feel lucky we’ve bene able to do this as long as we have.”
* Unlike battling brothers in other bands, Sam and keyboardist Casey, who’s been blind since birth, “get along really well” according to Sam. “I think there’s a stark difference between our relationship and something like the (Oasis) Gallagher brothers. They’re both frontmen in their own right, and my brother has no interest, thankfully, of being the lead singer of this band. I think that helps the dynamic for sure. We have definitely gone through phases on a personal level of being at each other’s throats, but there’s a love there that runs very, very deep and a dedication and commitment to each other. It’s not always great and there’s times we’re fighting, still, but we really do get along great and we love each other a lot. I feel very lucky.”
X-Ambassadors performs Friday, May 24 at Saint Andrew’s Hall, 431 E. Congress St., Detroit. Doors at 6:30 p.m. 313-961-8961 or saintandrewsdetroit.com.
