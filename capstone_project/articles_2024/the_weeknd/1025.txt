Somebody turn on "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd!
If you've ever wondered if it's illegal to flash your headlights at somebody, so have I. I found myself doing it and wondered what would happen if a cop saw me do it.
So quick story about my commute home recently. I was driving on I-95 South in Philadelphia during the evening rush. A car in front of me turned his right turn signal on, but took forever to get into the right lane.
Trust me when I tell you, it was the car equivalent to a snail's pace - meanwhile, I'm coming up about 60 mph behind him, and this car is only halfway over the line! Taking its sweet time like it's a Sunday afternoon in Georgia. I flash my bright beams at them for a quick second as if to say "Hurry up!" (Hey, at least I didn't honk!)
Okay I'll admit, this was a slightly unpleasant way to use my headlights to communicate to another driver. But of course, there are also more courteous purposes.
It's not illegal in Pennsylvania - IF you don't do it dangerously.
According to Title 75 in the Statutes of Pennsylvania (75 Pa. C.S.A. Sec. 4306):
"Whenever the driver of a vehicle approaches an oncoming vehicle within 500 feet, the driver shall use the low beam of light."
If you're approaching a vehicle from the rear:
"Whenever the driver of a vehicle approaches another vehicle from the rear within 300 feet, the driver shall use the low beam of light."
But other than that, flashing your lights shouldn't get you a ticket in Pennsylvania, as the section also states:
"Nothing in this section shall limit drivers from flashing high beams at oncoming vehicles as a warning of roadway emergencies or other dangerous or hazardous conditions ahead."
Bottom line is - just don't blind anybody.
