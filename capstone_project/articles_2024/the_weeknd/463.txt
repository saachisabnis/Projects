SUGGESTED: Kendrick Lamar is accusing Drake of having a "secret daughter" in a newly-released diss track "Meet the Grahams."
LOS ANGELES - "The Roots" drummer Questlove, one of the most respected names in hip-hop, is not amused by the ongoing feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar. 
The 53-year-old hip-hop connoisseur, took to Instagram to share his thoughts, and concluded that "Hip Hop is Truly Dead." 
"Nobody won the war" he wrote. "This wasn’t about skill. This was a wrestling match level mudslinging and takedown by any means necessary – women & children (& actual facts) be damned."
His post continued to read, "Same audience wanting blood will soon put up "rip" posts like they weren’t part of the problem. Hip Hop Is Truly Dead."
Earlier this week, Drake’s security guard was shot and wounded outside his Toronto mansion in the lavish Bridle Path neighborhood.
A security guard was injured after a drive-by shooting at Drake's Toronto mansion.
Sources close to the situation allege the Toronto shooting was not related to the ongoing fall out with Lamar but was in retaliation after Cash XO’s security was shot outside his Los Angeles area home. Cash XO co-founded XO Records with The Weeknd, another artist Drake is at odds with.
