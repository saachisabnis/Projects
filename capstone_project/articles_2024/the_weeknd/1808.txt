Metro Boomin called out “soulless” songs geared towards TikTok success. On Tuesday (Jan. 30), an X/Twitter user reacted to Universal Music Group announcing they would remove their its roster of music from the social media platform. The fan appeared shocked as they declared that the music industry was entering a new “era.” “Wow just like that the TikTok era of music is over,” they xweeted. 

	Metro, who is signed to Republica Records, a UMG subsidiary, caught wind of the post and reveled in the fact that TikTok and UMG were ending their partnership. He responded with a gif of LeBron James when he was with the Miami Heat, saying, “It’s about damn time.” 











	The GRAMMY award-winning producer then followed up with a post praising the kids’ creativity using TikTok to promote their music. However, he also took aim at “soulless” songs manufactured for TikTok success.

I love the creativity and appreciation the kids show for the music on TikTok but I don’t like the forced pandering from artists and labels that results in these lifeless and soulless records.

	“I love the creativity and appreciation the kids show for the music on TikTok but I don’t like the forced pandering from artists and labels that results in these lifeless and soulless records,” he typed. On Tuesday (Jan. 30), Universal Music Group revealed they would be removing their artists’ music from the platform if the two entities didn’t strike a new deal. 

UMG released an open letter addressing TikTok and the growing concern over artist royalties. The record company admitted that TikTok had positioned itself as a major tool in helping artists market their art. But UMG argued that better payouts needed to be installed for their musicians on the platform. In the letter, the company alleged that TikTok “attempted to bully them” into accepting below-market value payment.

	“With respect to the issue of artist and songwriter compensation, TikTok proposed paying our artists and songwriters at a rate that is a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay,” the letter reads. “Today, as an indication of how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content, TikTok accounts for only about 1% of our total revenue. Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music.”

	TikTok issued a statement responding to UMG. The company called out UMG for greed and putting their business over their artists. The social media app even accused Universal Music Group of running with “false narratives.”  

	After the two parties disagreed, UMG ended the partnership. On Thursday (Feb. 1), UMG began removing their artists’ music from the social media app. 

	UMG’s roster includes some of music’s biggest stars such as Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, The Weeknd, Alicia Keys, SZA, Steve Lacy, Drake, J Balvin, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, The Beatles, and more.
