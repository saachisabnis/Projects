The Weeknd is gearing up for the release of his highly anticipated new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, and he’s doing it in style. In collaboration with acclaimed filmmaker and artist Harmony Korine, The Weeknd has dropped a limited-edition vinyl for the upcoming project, available for pre-order exclusively for a short 72-hour window. If you’re a fan of The Weeknd or a vinyl enthusiast, this is one collectible you don’t want to miss!
Produced by EDGLRD, Korine’s cutting-edge creative and tech company, the vinyl is designed to stand out. A sleek black record comes housed in a visually striking case featuring a purple and blue color scheme that sets the mood. The cover art showcases a mysterious face, adding an abstract, artistic vibe to the package, marking a departure from the previously revealed album art featuring The Weeknd himself, complete with his now-signature dark circles under the eyes. On the back, you’ll find the album title Hurry Up Tomorrow scribbled in a handwritten-style font against a minimal black background, giving it that authentic, DIY aesthetic.
The limited-edition vinyl isn’t just about looks, though. It’s a part of The Weeknd’s evolving creative journey, culminating in what is set to be the final chapter of his After Hours trilogy. With Hurry Up Tomorrow, The Weeknd continues his exploration of darkness, self-reflection, and emotional depth, which fans have come to expect from the trilogy that began with After Hours and Dawn FM.
Fans got their first taste of the album with the release of the lead single, “Timeless,” featuring Playboi Carti. The song has already set the stage for what’s expected to be a sonic journey unlike any other, blending The Weeknd’s signature moody synths with Playboi Carti’s high-energy flow. But the real excitement lies in what else The Weeknd has in store for the album—if “Timeless” is any indication, Hurry Up Tomorrow is bound to be a masterpiece.
The Weeknd’s collaboration with Harmony Korine adds a new layer of artistry to the album’s release, as Korine is known for pushing boundaries in film and art. His involvement hints that Hurry Up Tomorrow is not just an album but a larger, more immersive experience.
For those looking to snag the limited-edition vinyl, act fast. Pre-orders are live now but only for a brief 72-hour window. The vinyl is priced at $38 USD and is sure to be a collector’s item, especially with such a short pre-order period.
