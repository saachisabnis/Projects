According to a report Billboard published on Monday, April 29, Cash was inside his home in Los Angeles when shots were fired at the front of his property at around 2:30 a.m. The Los Angeles Police Department told the outlet a man inside a guard shack heard a few gunshots before he realized he was struck by a bullet.
