The beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar went from zero to 100 real quick today. After K-Dot unleashed "6:16 in LA" early Friday morning, Drizzy had a rap retort ready in the form of "Family Matters," a wildly offensive diss track that insults Kendrick at every turn.
The lyrical jabs Drake took on Friday night (May 3) were expected since he's been taunting Kenny to finally respond ever since he came for The Boy and J. Cole on "Like That" in March. Boi-1da, Tay Keith, Mark Ronson, Fierce and Kevin Mitchell produce the thumping energy of the Toronto MC's "Family Matters," which features three different beat switches throughout its 7:36-runtime.
He attacks with brutal force from the jump, firing back at Kendrick's claims that Drake's got a mole in OVO and calling the West Coast MC a fake activist. The Boy bodies K-Dot with offensive lines directed at his fiancée Whitney Alford, which include everything from abuse allegations to cheating with pgLang partner Dave Free. Drake is playing dirty. Nothing is off limits in this battle.
There are also darts for Rick Ross, The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky and Future on the track. Everybody's getting lit up here.
Here are the complete lyrics to Drake's "Family Matters" diss aimed at Kendrick Lamar.
