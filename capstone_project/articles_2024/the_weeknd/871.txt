Juice WRLD and Nicki Minaj reunite on their brand-new collaboration. On Friday, November 15, the late Chicago rapper's estate released his new song "AGATS2 (Insecure)" via Grade A Productions. On the song produced by Louis Bell, Juice serves up fresh bars that sound more energetic than the original track. "All Girls Are The Same" first appeared on the deceased rapper's debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance. The updated sequel has Juice and Nicki tag-teaming on their verses while singer Halsey provides background vocals. "Bad women, no good, bad women/Hotel rooms and Versace linens," they croon together. "Wake up in the morning, scrambling for some Advil/Last night, last night was too mad real." 
Nicki Minaj and Juice WRLD first collaborated in spring 2019 when they hit the road together overseas for The Nicki Wrld Tour. Both artists performed in countries throughout Europe just months before the Grade A Productions signee passed away from an accidental overdose. Juice WRLD posthumously reunited with Minaj on Young Thug's song "Money" from his BUSINESS IS BUSINESS album, which dropped last year while Thugger was in jail. "AGATS2 (Insecure)" is the first single from Juice's upcoming posthumous album The Party Never Ends. It arrived a couple of months after his label released The Pre-Party EP, which features four tracks including "Lightyears" featuring Young Thug. Juice's new album drops November 22. Juice's new song appears on iHeartRadio's Rap Rising playlist along with other fresh tracks from Lil Baby, Paul Wall and others. It also dropped on the same day as anticipated projects from Cordae, Kash Doll, Denzel Curry, Dave East and more. Press play on the playlist above and scroll below for more new music.
