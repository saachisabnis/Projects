Kelly Clarkson has totally banned social media for her kids. “I have informed them they’re not allowed to, under my roof, ever have social media,” she told People in a new feature, explaining that it “can be really hard on kids in general but especially kids with parents in the public eye.” And Clarkson promises that she’ll stick to the rule for daughter River Rose, 9, and son Remington Alexander, 7, even if their dad (and Clarkson’s ex) Brandson Blackstock doesn’t. “My daughter was like, ‘Well, what if Dad lets me?’ I’m like, ‘Well, you’re there four days a month. Enjoy that.’ And right now he’s not letting them do it either,” Clarkson told People. “I’ll listen when they’re older, but until they have a solid argument, it’s a no.”
