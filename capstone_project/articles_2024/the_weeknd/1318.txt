Home    Forums    Music    Grammy Nominations Reactions (Part 2)
One thing I love about this forum is perseverance. Cuz are we still predicting a Beyoncé win for AOTY in 2024 😂😂😂
COWBOY CARTER ALBUM OF THE YEAR
Billboard has reported that Chappell Roan fired her manager, could this effect her Grammy chances? 
At most this will increase her exposure
Cowboy Carter will and should win. The album is flawless and it was a moment of artistry and culture. I honestly wouldn’t be shocked if all three of Grammys princesses swept the general field. Album: Beyonce Record: Boiled Eilish Song: Taylor Swift

when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
All this whining on social media about Ariana is annoying. Girl got nominated in three categories, more than a LOT of people. These folks listen to the same six artists their whole lives and get upset when one of them isn’t nominated. The lineup has four pop albums, one electropop, a country album (by a popstar), a jazz/new age album, and that mess from Jacob. So many genres aren’t even part of the conversation to prioritize what’s mainstream (pop), and tons of artists will never have a shot at a GF nomination just because they’re not mainstream enough, but people are complaining because yet another pop star isn’t on the list, like…
random note, the longest running top 10 hits ever:
Blinding Lights
Stay
Lose Control
Levitating
Last Night
=0 noms, 0 noms, 0 noms, 0 noms, 0 noms.
I mean, “Levitating” could have been nominated if it were submitted. But that rando had to ruin her moment.

People and it’s ariana’s fans who still won’t accept she’s a disposable artist that no one takes seriously. Now they’re thinking that she’s going to bag an Oscar nomination… she has to release THEE ALBUM to be taken seriously.

She needs to work with Pharell again. sweetener remains her best body of work to date.

as an Ariana stan i totally agree, they are being very annoying. this is her 2nd most nominated album. i’m frustrated that she got snubbed in pop solo and bmv (especially the latter, genuinely what does she have to do to get nominaated there…?) but they’re acting like this is a Weeknd situation

well yes because this time it actually makes sense with the way the genres of voters will split
in case anyone missed this from the AOTY, thread. Beyoncé is in a good starting place:
I’m sorry but this is Beyoncé’s best case scenario. TWO jazz artists so they vote split, Charli smashing with pop so she’s taking votes away from Sabrina, Chappell and Billie (which already were prone to vote splitting) and BRAT’s domination makes me feel like it got some alt voters on its side too. Plus, pop voters clearly must have liked CC too, especially with Levii’s beating a R/SOTY *searched for* nominee in Pop Duo. The last time we had a massive vote split with pop, the jazz/Americana combo of Jon Batiste won. Jazz will vote split, so Beyoncé is getting all Americana + country + R&B (no one close to R&B heew so they’ll namecheck their fav) and probably Rap cuz, let’s be real, rap voters are not going for the Andre fully instrumental flute record. Not to mention some pop. And of course, let’s not be naïve about the current state of the US and how this album could in some ways resonate. I still hold that it won’t be as political as a TPAB or This Is America, but nonetheless it’s got some aspects of that. This is easily her best shot since IASF. 
As a somewhat biased Ariana fan, I’m just disappointed about her missing BPSP. I had high hopes in that category considering her track record with Pop nominations.
I hadn’t felt confident about ROTY/SOTY nominations for months and knew her chances in AOTY were iffy, but I really thought she was going to pull 4/4 nominations in the pop field.
Anyways, here’s to dreaming that voters choose the biggest song in Best Dance Pop Recording. : )
Honey, the Ariana Grande Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Music Video predictions were completely delusional.  Anyone with a brain knew that was NOT ever happening.
