	TikTok user @lockerblocker20 recently came across a treasure trove of Ye merch during a livestream. They found boxes of everything ranging from performance costumes to Yeezy design notes to recording equipment. The latter of which caught the attention to former Ye collaborator Mike Dean.

	In the comments of one of the videos, Dean asked, “Any Mike Dean cases in there?” to which the creator replied, “No.”

	There was an Ensoniq ASR 10 keyboard with the name “Tarik” on it, though, plus earpieces and microphones. There were also boxes of garments and masks from the 2019 opera “Nebuchadnezzar” and “Sunday Service” costumes, along with YZY season catalogues and patent cards.

	Back in December of 2022, Mike Dean reposted a message from Swedish House Mafia member Steve Angello reacting to Ye’s appearance on Alex Jones’ Info Wars where he praised Hitler causing some to speculate that the two have had a falling out. “When media attention becomes more important than like itself, you’re on a slippery slope,” wrote Angello. “Saying provocative things to trigger social media for clicks and action is pathetic.”

	Then a year later, a fan asked Dean if he wasn’t working with rapper “because of the Hitler thing.” The Houston musician replied, “Because I’m busy with much cooler people.” At the time, Dean was on tour with The Weeknd. Something he had to remind another fan who claimed he “wasn’t invited” to work on Ye’s latest, saying, “I passed thanks. On a little tour” in the now-deleted tweets.

	There’s no word as to whether the storage locker belongs to Ye or someone from his team.
