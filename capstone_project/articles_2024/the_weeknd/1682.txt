Lady Gaga is trading in the “LoveGame” for a video game. The singer is coming to Fortnite Festival as the second season’s headlining icon, launching Feb. 22.

	Her hits “Applause,” “Bloody Mary,” “Born This Way,” “The Edge of Glory,” “Just Dance,” “Rain on Me” and “Stupid Love” will be playable Jam Tracks, all available to perform on a “Chromatica”-inspired stage.

	Players have the option to purchase the Premium Reward Track upgrade for 1,800 V-Bucks, can unlock “Poker Face” and Gaga-themed cosmetics, including the Enigmatic Gaga Outfit (Lady Gaga’s purple bodysuit designed by celebrity designer Nange Magro) and custom instruments. The free track will include Woodworker Drums, three new jam tracks, an aura and two new emotes.

	Gaga is the second-ever headliner for “Fortnite” Festival mode, which debuted in late 2023 with The Weeknd as its leading icon.

	Earlier this month, Disney announced it would be investing $1.5 billion in Fortnite developer Epic Games in what will be the brand’s “biggest foray into the game space ever,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said.

	“We’ve entered into a strategic relationship with Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite to not only invest in the company — [Disney] took a minority stake of $1.5 billion investment — but we’re also creating a huge Disney universe,” Iger said in on CNBC ahead of the company’s quarterly earnings call.
