Absolutely love The Weeknd for doing this, he is giving back to the Los Angeles community by partnering up with L.A. nonprofit School on Wheels to "support more than 1,000 students who are 'experiencing homelessness from kindergarten through twelfth grade.'" 
Abel made a large donation to the nonprofit organization and they will be providing "tutoring and literacy tools, connections to post-high school mentorship opportunities through the BUS (Believe-Understand-Succeed) program, and technology assistance." Love that!! The students will be getting Chromebooks and laptops, internet access, and software programs to help improve their learning skills. For more, click here.
