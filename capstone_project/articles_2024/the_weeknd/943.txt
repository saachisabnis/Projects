From PARTYNEXTDOOR to Drake to The Weeknd and beyond, the greater Toronto are has markedly influenced the way in which Pop, R&B and Rap sounds today. As PARTYNEXTDOOR prepares to release his next album and Drake tours with J. Cole, it appears a new artist out of the region is preparing to make an impact on the Hip-Hop scene. With an intoxicating blend of unfiltered trap and soulful harmonies, Kwazii is ready for the world to know his name.
Just a few months after making his way to New York for an “On The Radar” freestyle, Kwazii has locked in with another popular digital performance platform — From The Block. With the skyline sitting behind him, the emerging artist delivered an inspired performance of his latest single, “Reparations.” The three-minute track finds the Brampton native employing multiple flows as he lets everyone in his past, present and future know that he’s coming to get everything that he’s owed.
“Everywhere I go someone all in my face/Tell that lil’ h*e back up/Push up off me/Back up/Try to copy but you know you can’t bite the Dracula,” he raps.
“Only came by to let you n*ggas know I’m all good/Left/Four door/Came back (Skrtt)/Wings.”
Kwazii’s “Reparations” performance visual arrives one week after Dead Egos debuted the “Eglinton Ave” video. With only a few visuals and tracks available, it’s still too early to determine how the Brampton native will fit into today’s music landscape, but it’s clear that he’s aiming for the top spot.
