Billie Eilish is officially Spotify‘s most streamed monthly artist, the streaming platform announced on Monday (Aug. 19), replacing The Weeknd at the summit. 

	The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) showed his support for Eilish last week, when she was nearing his record. “Let’s go !” he wrote alongside a series of heart, prayer and line graph emojis on X, retweeting a post noting that, on Aug. 15, she was less than 1 million listeners away from becoming Spotify’s most streamed artist.

	By passing the 100 million monthly listener ceiling in June 2024, she is the third and youngest artist to ever do so, following both Tesfaye and Taylor Swift. Eilish currently has eight of her 82 songs in Spotify’s Billions Club, which marks tracks that have surpassed one billion streams: “Lovely” with Khalid (2.8 billion plays to date), “Bad Guy” (2.5 billion), “When the Party’s Over” (1.8 billion), “Everything I Wanted” (1.6 billion), “Ocean Eyes” (1.4 billion), “Happier Than Ever” (1.3 billion), “Idontwannabeyouanymore” (1.09 billion) and “Bury a Friend” (1.01 billion).

	Her third album, the 10-track Hit Me Hard and Soft, dropped back in April and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The project features hits like “Birds of a Feather,” “Chihiro” and “Lunch.” Eilish’s debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, and sophomore follow-up, Happier Than Ever, both topped the chart for three weeks.
