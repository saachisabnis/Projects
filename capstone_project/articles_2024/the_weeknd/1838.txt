Madonna and Price previously worked together on the singer’s beloved 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor, a record which housed iconic singles like ‘Hung Up’, ‘Sorry’ and ‘Jump’.
The pair partnered up once more when Price, who has also worked with artists like Dua Lipa, Kylie Minogue and the Pet Shop Boys, signed on as the musical director of Madonna’s Celebration Tour. 
Speaking to The Sun, an insider revealed that working on the tour together “reignited the spark” between singer and producer. 
“Madonna is ready to put down some new tunes,” they said, adding: “She has fire in her belly and cannot wait to get started.” 
Rumours about Madonna’s 15th studio album have circulated ever since the singer released her last record, 2019’s Madame X. 
In 2023, the singer shared a behind the scenes of herself alongside pop hitmaker Max Martin, who has worked with the likes of Britney Spears, The Weeknd, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.
“When it doubt go to work,” she wrote on social media. “Nothing shuts down the noise or the naysayers more then [sic] being in the creative process.”

It’s been five years since Madonna last released an album, the longest gap between record releases in the singer’s four decade-long career. 
Given the significance of Confessions on a Dance Floor among Madonna fans, news that the singer is working with Price again is sure to spark excitement. 
We just hope we don’t have to wait too long to hear the fruits of their labour.
