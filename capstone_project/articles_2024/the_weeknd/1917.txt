We surprised @MsLaurynHill at an intimate dinner in New York to tell her that The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was No. 1 on our #100BestAlbums list. 🏆 What does this album mean to you? pic.twitter.com/BslciRVEm0

Now then… where to begin?
How about this comment? “Worst list ever.”
Why?
Well, there is no shortage of reasons, according to the thousands of comments Apple Music’s Top 100 Albums list received on X (Twitter) on Wednesday.
“Pathetic top 100 list,” one person commented. “No Who albums. No Queen. No Billy Joel. No CSN. No Cat Stevens. And leaving out Sergeant Pepper, one of the greatest albums, from the top 100 is all you need to know of these judges. Go back to the drawing board.”
Green Day not cracking the Top 100 is criminal.

“There’s only one MJ album that made it to the ‘best albums’ list and it’s number 2?” another person wrote. “Also, where is Owl City (Adam Young) in this list? He’s the best artist of our generation and his album Ocean Eyes was certified double platinum by the RIAA last year. Really bad list @AppleMusic!”
The Weeknd didn’t make the list…

“Hard to imagine what the set of criteria for this awful list could have been,” another commenter wondered.
Then there was this thread of snubbed albums with 170 (and counting) responses…
Artists with no entries & their record breaking albums that @AppleMusic didn’t include in their Top 100 Albums of All Time List
A much needed thread.🧵 pic.twitter.com/oalXwSK6dF
