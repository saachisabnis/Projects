Just when you thought the Drake and Rick Ross beef was over, the pair are now trading subliminals online. The Toronto rapper recently hopped on his Instagram story to share his thoughts about the track. 
He shared a screenshot of an exchange between him and his mother. She apparently caught wind of Ross’s new track, in which he claimed Drake had gotten plastic surgery. Throughout the track, Ross also references Drake’s racial identity and alludes to him being white. To clarify, Drake is, in fact, biracial.

“That wasn’t the same white boy that I seen, n*gga, when we were makin’ them early records,” he raps. “When you were happy to be around n*ggas, seein’ n*ggas holdin’ them sticks.” According to Drake, Rick Ross is just upset and even went as far as to say that he’s a racist. 
Ross has since responded to the “Rich Baby Daddy” rapper’s post with a clip on social media. The Maybach Music CEO referred to Drake as “BBL Drizzy” and joked about him “calling his mommy.”

Things heated up between the two after Drake called out Ross, Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd, and more with his “Push Ups” track. The track appeared to be a response to Lamar’s verse on Furture and Metro Boomin’s “Like Dat.” 
Not too long after, Rozay responded with “Champagne Moments.” Despite the pair’s history and successful collaborations, it seems that, for now, that’s over.
