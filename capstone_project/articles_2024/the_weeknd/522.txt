Drake might be cooking up some serious heat in response to the barrage of disses fired his way in recent weeks. At least that’s what one of his new social-media posts suggests.
On Friday (April 12), the Canadian superstar took to his Instagram Stories and shared a cartoon showing two people digging into the earth in search of diamonds. One person gives up and leaves right as he was about to hit the jackpot, whereas the other seems determined to continue.

“Never give up. You may be closer than you think,” the image is captioned, with “a reaction” stamped over the diamond cluster in the ground.

The 6 God is currently negotiating a number of attacks released over Future and Metro Boomin‘s last two albums, namely from Kendrick Lamar, A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd.
Earlier this week, prior to the most recent shots fired at him, Joe Budden claimed that Drizzy and K.Dot are both in the process of preparing nuclear diss songs as part of their ongoing beef. On the latest episode of The Joe Budden Podcast published in early April, the media personality kicked things off by hyping the budding rivalry.

“Kendrick has earned himself a bye with Cole’s apology, but I think that the insiders know— actually I have it on good information that both sides went in the booth and came out.”

He continued: “What I’m hearing about both sides is it’s nuclear. It’s up up. I’m hearing this from people that can rap, so I wanna come in here and say that speculation time is over. Debate time is over.
“I’ve been saying for a few pods now that I’ve seen absolutely nothing from Drake to get me excited enough to think that he will be capable of doing what needs to be done against the likes of a Kendrick Lamar. I am here to say that there is no longer any need for me to instigate it.”
