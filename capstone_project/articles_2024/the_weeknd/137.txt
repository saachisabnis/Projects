	The Weeknd has got fans buzzing that new music is on the way. 

	The star (real name Abel Tesfaye) took to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday (Feb. 13) to share a series of photos from what appears to be a music studio, including a photo in which he’s standing behind the microphone. See the snaps before they disappear here.

	Tesfaye’s teaser comes a month after he posted the album covers from his 2020 album After Hours and 2022’s Dawn FM, and a third, black slide with a white question mark in the middle and a parental advisory warning label. “3,” he wrote as the caption, indicating that a third installment of the album trilogy is on the way.

	He previously said in a May 2023 interview with W Magazine that his next studio album will be his final one as The Weeknd. “It’s getting to a place and a time where I’m getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter. I’ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I’m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn,” he said at the time. “The album I’m working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd. This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I’ve said everything I can say.”
