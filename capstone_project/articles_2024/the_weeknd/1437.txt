Taylor Swift might be a well-established member of Chiefs Kingdom, but that doesn’t mean the team was bumping The Tortured Poets Department all year long. 
In a TikTok video posted by the Kansas City Chiefs on Wednesday, December 11, members of the team were asked: What was your top streamed artist of the year?
Defensive tackles Mike Pennel and Chris Jones both said rapper NBA YoungBoy, while running back Kareem Hunt picked Rod Wave. Cornerback Nazeeh Johnson chose Chris Brown and offensive tackle Creed Humphrey said Kings of Leon. 
Other players in the video picked artists like Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Tems, Lauryn Hill and Future. 
Not a single player in the video, however, picked Swift, 34, the girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 
As for the elephant in the room: No, Kelce does not appear in the clip. 
Predictably, the comment section of the video was filled with Swifties who did not take kindly to the pop star being ignored by Kelce’s teammates. 
“You all didn’t understand the assignment 😂,” one wrote. Another commented, “Chris Brown??? In 2024?? Woof.”
Swift fans were, understandably, also upset about Kelce not being included in the video. 
“Where is our Travy for this question 😂,” one person commented. Another wrote, “I’m personally insulted by the fact that Travis Kelce was not in this.”
At least one level-headed commenter brought some peace to the conversation, writing, “We don’t need an answer from Travis we already know.”
According to Spotify, Swift was the most-streamed artist globally on the platform for the second year in a row. Her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, was also the most-streamed album in the world. 
All told, Swift’s music generated more than 26.6 billion streams on the platform this year — just not in the Chiefs locker room. 
The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish rounded out Spotify’s most-streamed list globally. 
While Kelce might not have appeared in the Chiefs TikTok video, he did gush about Swift and the conclusion of her Eras Tour on the latest installment of his “New Heights” podcast, cohosted with big brother Jason Kelce.

“Shout-out to Tay, and the unbelievable Eras Tour has finally come to an end,” Kelce said on the Wednesday, December 11 episode. 
Kelce added, “Shout-out to everybody that was a part of that show. Obviously, it’s her music, her tour and everything, but that was a full production, man. That thing was the best tour in the world because of a lot of people, but mostly because of Taylor.”
Swift’s Eras Tour wrapped up on Sunday, December 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia after 149 shows and earning more than $2 billion, the most profitable concert tour of all-time.
