2:22 PM PT -- We just got Ne-Yo at LAX, who says he doesn't totally agree that the Grammys don't hold weight ... but he does agree that there could be better, more inclusive ways to decide who should win.
Drake won't be partaking in the upcoming Grammy Awards -- despite being nominated -- because the guy just pulled his submissions ... TMZ has confirmed.
The rapper has withdrawn his 2 Grammy nominations -- one for Best Rap Album in "Certified Lover Boy" and another for Best Rap Performance in "Way 2 Sexy" -- after having gotten nods about two weeks ago.
A source close to Drake tells us the decision was made by Drake and his management team, Â and the Grammys board respected it. Variety was first to report Drake's withdraw.
He's obviously no stranger to the award ceremony -- having racked up multiple wins over the years, including one in 2019 -- but Drake has also publicly noted he isn't a fan of accolades like this ... saying they're virtually meaningless.
He was also one of the first to speak up after The Weeknd was snubbed by the ceremony, saying, "I think we should stop allowing ourselves to be shocked every year by the disconnect between impactful music and these awards."
Of course, this move might have more to do with his involvement in Astroworld Fest than his stance on awards -- the guy's been relatively low-key since the tragedy, especially since he's been named in a few of the lawsuits that have surfaced thus far.
He did something similar with French Montana recently -- refusing to clear a song they did together because he didn't think it was appropriate in the wake of Astroworld.
