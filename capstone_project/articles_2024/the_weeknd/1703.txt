New Music Friday has no shortage of star power this week as arguably the most talked-about female rapper on the planet, Sexyy Red, drops a surprise single with one of her heroes, Gucci Mane.
It’s a particularly strong week for women as GloRilla doubles back with bonus material from her debut album Glorious while Summer Walker, Saweetie and Lady Leshurr also serve up some new sounds.

Holding it down for the men is Polo G with his grown-up new track while blog era veterans Kid Cudi and Wiz Khalifa continue to have prolific years.
For those who like their Hip Hop a little more lyrical, The Alchemist has bolsters his recent ScHoolboy Q collaboration “Ferraris in the Rain” with a guest verse from Freddie Gibbs, while Boldy James, Saba, Dave East and Russ are also in the mix.

Sexyy Red has made no secret of the fact that she loves some Gucci Mane, even getting an ice cream tattoo on her face in his honor. Now, they’ve stepped it up a level and finally hit the studio together for “You Don’t Love Me,” which samples Guwop’s classic hit “I Think I Love Her.”

On this bonus track from her recently released debut album Glorious, which cracked the top five on the Billboard 200, Big Glo continues to prove why she is just about everybody’s favorite new artist.

Originally heard four years ago during the episode of American Dad that The Weeknd guest starred in (and in which Roger the alien dons the singer’s iconic haircut), the humorous hit has finally received a commercial release as part of a new Greatest Hits compilation.
Produced By: DJ AYO, Carter & Higherrside
Standing for “Self Inflicted Pain”,” Polo G’s latest offering sees him in a more introspective mood as he looks to evolve as an artist. The track arrives just weeks after the release of his long-awaited album Hood Poet.

The Alchemist has never gone cold enough to have what could be called a hot streak, but there’s no denying he’s been on fire in 2024. Now, he’s added longtime collaborator Freddie Gibbs to an updated version of his and Q’s recent collaboration “Ferraris in the Rain.” More servings of Alfredo 2, please.
Produced By: Cardo, JasonMartin & Dominique
Wiz has been more focused of late on proving he still has some lyrical chops, but this new collaboration with Don Toliver proves he still has broader pop sensibilities.
Produced By: Kid Cudi
Cudi’s newest single coincides with the latest issue of his Moon Man comic book series and looks to tide fans over until the release of his 11th studio album next summer.
