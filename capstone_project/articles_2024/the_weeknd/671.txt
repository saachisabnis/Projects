The Weeknd has announced a one-night only concert in São Paulo, Brazil. The event will debut an all-new live production, and will take place on Saturday, September 7, at Estádio MorumBIS—a 66,795-capacity soccer stadium in the Brazilian metropolis. Produced by Live Nation, the performance follows the Weeknd’s highly stylized After Hours Til Dawn Tour, which took place in 2022 and 2023.
One dollar from each ticket sold for the São Paulo concert will go toward the Weeknd’s XO Humanitarian Fund, which provides food and support to those experiencing severe hunger around the globe. The Weeknd—who was named a United Nations World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021—will partner with the United Nations organization to make the donation.
