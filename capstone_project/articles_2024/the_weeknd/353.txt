The ethereal bond between Kendrick Lamar and Tupac Shakur is a testament to the enduring influence of hip-hop. Lamar is often celebrated as a top-tier emcee, frequently compared to the legendary Shakur. His unique way of paying homage to the late hip-hop icon has earned him recognition from Tupac's estate. This was evident in the recent cease and desist letter Tupac's estate sent to Drake after he used an AI-generated Tupac in his Kendrick Lamar diss track, "Taylor Made Freestyle." The estate defended Lamar as a friend of Tupac, emphasizing their mutual respect despite never having met during their lifetimes.
In a 2011 interview with Home Grown Radio, the Compton native shared a vision he had about the late rapper. This vision went beyond the typical cliche assumption of the act. According to Lamar, in this vision, a silhouette of Shakur appeared and encouraged him to continue rapping and keep his music alive. “I was sleeping one night and a silhouette [came] and he said, ‘Keep doing what you doing, don’t let my music die,’” said Lamar.
The vision happened when Lamar was 21 years old and ultimately refined his artistic trajectory to one of sincere depth and communal zenith. He told GQ, “I’m not huge on superstition and all that stuff. That’s what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts; hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying ,'Don’t let the music die.’ Hearing it clear as day — like he’s right there - just a silhouette."
On the 19th anniversary of Tupac Shakur’s death in 2015, his estate published a letter written by Lamar to Shakur. In it, he reflects on how the hip-hop icon formed the cornerstone of inspiration for his rap career. Lamar revealed his first sighting of Shakur was at the age of 8, a moment that enhanced his artistic confidence. The touching letter was published on the official website, 2Pac.com and said:
“I was 8 yrs old when I first saw you. I couldn’t describe how I felt at that moment. So many emotions. Full of excitement. Full of joy and eagerness. 20 yrs later I understand exactly what that feeling was. INSPIRED.
The people that you touched on that small intersection changed lives forever. I told myself I wanted to be a voice for man one day. Whoever knew I was speaking out loud for u to listen.”

Kendrick Lamar drew from his admiration for Tupac Shakur to curate his third studio album, To Pimp A Butterfly. Lamar revealed in a 2015 sit down with MTV that the album’s original title was Tu Pimp a Caterpillar, an at large commemoration of the beloved late rapper. The homophonic use of “Tu” plus the abbreviation of “Pimp a Caterpillar,” P.A.C., spelled out his idol’s name.
Lamar changed the title to To Pimp A Butterfly in order to emphasize the positivity of life, contrasting the negative associations of "pimp." For him, it symbolizes utilizing fame in a positive manner and steering clear of exploitation by the music industry.
On the final track of the album, "Mortal Man," Shakur appears posthumously in a phantom interview with Lamar. Shakur’s likeness are actually sound bites from a rare 1994 interview conducted by the Harlem-born talent with Swedish music journalist Mats Nileskär. The creative force behind Butterfly takes on the role of the journalist, asking a different set of questions focused mainly on Blackness, fame, and the state of modern hip-hop.

Over the past decade, Kendrick Lamar has become a prominent figure in contemporary hip-hop, wielding influence comparable to the legendary Tupac Shakur. Often compared to Shakur, who fearlessly addressed societal issues, Kendrick has assumed a similar role as a voice for his generation. Evidence of this can be found in his discography, with lyrics featured in songs like "Alright" and "DNA," which incorporate themes from the Black Lives Matter movement and showcase his ability to use music as a platform for social commentary — much like how Shakur did on "Dear Mama" and "Brenda's Got a Baby."
This is just one of several connections between the two artists, including their representation of the West Coast region due to their noted California residencies. They are widely acknowledged for their distinct specialties, with many favoring Shakur's intense diction and Lamar's technical dexterity. Shakur is widely heralded as the undisputed G.O.A.T., often securing one of the top three spots in the eyes of a wide range of hip-hop enthusiasts. Meanwhile, Lamar has rightfully earned recognition as one of the greatest artists of his era and is worthy of consideration in top 10 discussions as per 2024.

As reported by Forbes, the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake began when Lamar featured on Metro Boomin and Future’s No.1 hit “Like That” and downplayed Drake and J. Cole’s claim of being part of the "big three" in rap by stating it's just "big me." J. Cole initially responded to Lamar with a diss song that was later retracted, citing dissatisfaction with his last album and cultural pressure as reasons for his actions. A leaked diss track from Drake titled “Push Ups” surfaced, drawing in more targets such as Rick Ross and The Weeknd. Despite no response from Lamar at this time, the feud continued to escalate with ongoing developments.
Drake released another diss on Friday, "Taylor Made Freestyle," featuring AI-generated voices of the late Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Snoop playfully responded in an Instagram video on the same day as the song's release. The track was posted on Drake’s social media and was not released on any streaming platform.
On Wednesday, Shakur's estate sent a cease and desist letter to Drake, expressing their disapproval of the use of AI-generated Tupac vocals. The estate's lawyer Howard King expressed their displeasure with how the act was used to slight Lamar, who is "a close friend to the Estate and has consistently shown respect for Tupac and his legacy, both publicly and privately." Drake honored the estate's request and removed the song from all of his social media platforms on the evening of April 25.

In the midst of this rap rivalry, where two of today's top-tier artists vie for dominance in the genre, there have been efforts to use revered figures in hip-hop as pawns in the battle. The support for Lamar from Shakur's estate emphasizes the importance of rappers maintaining integrity among their peers and across different eras, despite their competitive nature. The arrival of a cease and desist may have put an awkward halt in the feud, but hip-hop enthusiasts eagerly anticipate Lamar’s next groundbreaking move.
