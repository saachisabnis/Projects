Unless you’re suggesting that Gaga and Bruno are gonna sweep the rap categories then this was meant for another thread lol
It was for general sorry lmao
Honey, I said “I think”
Who do you (or anyone) think will win Melodic ? 
Honey, we have to wait until the nominees are revealed to determine who wins Best Melodic Rap Performance.  There is NOT a frontrunner.
Honey there is no doubt “Like That” will be submitted to Best Melodic Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. Future is literally SINGING on the chorus. I think Metro Boomin, Future & Kendrick will easily win this award.
Kendrick will also win Best Rap Song & Performance for “Not Like Us”.

I think we listened to an entirely different song because huh??? There really is nothing melodic about this song and I just do not see it getting submitted or allowed there. Future and Metro will probably either submit “Young Metro” or “We Still Don’t Trust You” with The Weeknd instead and just do “Like That” in Rap Performance/Song even though it’ll get left out of Performance.

Maybe Eazy-E sample in the chorus of Like That can be considered Melodic, maybe Kendrick’s OV-HOE part in NLU can be considered Melodic but i don’t think that.
I’m surprised Rocky releases his album in Fall, he kinda became the rap’s Frank Ocean.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.
Like That in Melodic would be a category fraud. It should go Rap Performance together with Not Like Us. Kendrick Lamar really doesn’t need to be nominated everywhere in his, theoretically, off year. He will be fine with the general field, Rap Performance and double spot in Rap Song.
If Beyoncé can be nominated 9 times in her “off year,” then I don’t see the issue with Kendrick being a leading nominee where he has two of the biggest and most buzzed about hits of the eligibility period.  Don’t pick and choose based on the artists you like.
And who wanted Beyonce to smash in nominations in her off year? If I remember well, nobody was predicting it. No even beyhive.
Honey, the category fraud be category frauding.  If “Love Language” can fraud its way into Best Traditional R&B Performance, “Like That” can certainly compete in Best Melodic Rap Performance.
“Agora Hills” samples a classic Troop/Jackson 5 R&B song. I predict it will be placed in Melodic Rap Performance. 
It was also her first #1 on urban radio and her biggest hit on that format since juicy. Plus it topped the rap airplay charts for a couple weeks being the first solo song by a female rapper to top since Playas last year, which shows she didn’t need to rely on a collaboration to have the most listened to rap song on radio. Putting it in pop solo wouldn’t be category fraud, But it would make sense to put it in the rap field since this era was supposed to be rap based. It would be a good way for people to see her more of rapper compared to a pop star who raps. Pop solo already has a lot going on anyways and she doesn’t have a strong guarantee for a nomination. Paint the town red didn’t even make the top ten on urban radio instead it was heavily carried by top 40 and rhythmic radio, plus it was #1 in the whole country; it makes more sense to put it in pop compared to agora hills due to its success and sound as well as the other songs she was able to submit. attention was a smarter choice to cover ground in the rap field and felt very appropriate. Paint could have been in rap field but it didn’t. All she has this year is Agora hills, so it would be a waste to nominate anything else from scarlet in melodic rap performance. Any other song from the album including demons is too weak and is a reckless gamble compared her competitors possible submission. Even if she did get nominated with something else it would just be a random filler nomination. Who knows she may submit different songs for rap performance and song, agora hills in melodic is her safest choice for nomination.  All in all, it would be a miss opportunity for Doja submitting it to pop instead of rap when this is her only solid record that kept her relevant during the eligibility period and opened her audience to other demographics she been  failing to reach since her mainstream debut in 2020.

reminder that also juicy was submitted to melodic rap performance in 2021 so hopefully her team does the same with agora
Like That can 1000% fit in the Melodic Rap Song Category. I have no earthly idea why its even a debate. And if Metro and Future want a Grammy they’ll indeed submit in that category because Not Like Us is taking Rap Song and Rap Performance guaranteed.
“Euphoria” is a such an award winning song. What happens if “Euphoria” is placed in Rap Performance and “Not Like Us” in Rap Song? I think Kendrick would still win for both. I think “Not Like Us” will probably be submitted across the board, though.
