The Weeknd gave fans a first preview at the third and final “chapter” of his ongoing album trilogy.
The XO Records head took to Instagram to share a video showing the popular motifs the artist has used since After Hours, including his red suit, sunglasses, sports car and a visual of him as an old man from the cover art of Dawn FM. As an unreleased track with The Weeknd’s vocals play in the background, the “younger” version of the artist appears with white bodies surrounding and stretching their arms out toward him. A ray of light slowly shines down upon him and expands, uncovering a garden beneath his feet. “There are three chapters in this tale,” the video’s ending reads.
While nothing official has been announced as of writing, The Weeknd told Variety in June 2023 that he was in the process of finishing the new project. “The name of it will come out soon, but it’s not called what some fans think it’s called… what they think it’s called is actually a song on the album, but that’s not what the actual album is called. [It’s unclear which speculative title he’s referring to.] So I’m just gonna say that,” he said.
Watch the teaser below and stay tuned for more info.
