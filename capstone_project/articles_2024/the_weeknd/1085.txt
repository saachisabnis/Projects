Jennie of BLACKPINK broke the previous record for most Hot 100 songs on Billboard! “One of the Girls” by The Weeknd, Jennie, and Lily-Rose Depp (from their HBO series “The Idol”) reached a new peak of No. 69 on the Hot 100 in its second week of release, according to Billboard’s official announcement on January 9 local time.
Breaking the previous record of No. 70 set by her bandmate Rosé’s solo debut single “On The Ground,” Jennie has become the highest-charting female K-pop soloist in Hot 100 history.
