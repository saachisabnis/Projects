Drake's security guard was shot and seriously injured outside the rapper's Toronto home early Tuesday morning, according to multiple reports. 
Toronto Police Operations has confirmed on social media that a shooting occurred at 2:09 a.m. outside a residence on Park Lane Circle, with the suspect fleeing in a vehicle. The victim was confirmed to be a security guard, who was shot while outside the gates of the home and transported to the hospital with "serious injuries." The guard remains hospitalized. 
The incident comes amid the 37-year-old's ongoing rap beef with Kendrick Lamar, though authorities have not indicated whether the two circumstances may be related. 
"I cannot speak to a motive at this time, because it’s so early," Inspector Paul Krawczyk said in a press conference, per the The New York Times. 
The outlet reports that authorities said Drake was not involved in the shooting, but could not confirm whether he was home at the time. Police also reportedly said that Drake is cooperating with authorities. 
Meanwhile, an image has gone viral showcasing Drake's OVO Store in London after an apparent vandalization. The photo shows the store's front window with the phrase, "They not like us," spray painted across it in a clear reference to Lamar's most recent diss track, "Not Like Us." 
The rapper has been in a lyrical war over the past month, catching heat from Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd and Rick Ross. Drake's most recent track was released on May 5. 
ET has reached out to Drake's rep for comment on the shooting.
