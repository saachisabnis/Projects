Playboi Carti gave the Rolling Loud crowd a taste of his upcoming album, but it wasn’t enough for some fans who hoped to hear the entire project. 
Carti had promised to play his highly anticipated “I AM MUSIC” album during his headlining set at Rolling Loud Miami on Sunday (December 15). Clips of his performance circulated online showed he was making good on his promise, previewing several new songs, including tracks produced by F1LTHY, Mike Dean and Metro Boomin.

While the Atlanta rapper has teased the project for years, he appears to be approaching a release date. Playboi Carti’s been sharing loosies on Instagram in recent months, but fans expected to hear the album at the festival’s 10th anniversary. 
In November, Playboi Carti told fans, “MIAMI TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY. I AM MUSIC WILL B PLAYED. KANT WAIT TO SEE YAL MFS NAH FR.” 
The anticipation only grew stronger when Rolling Loud creator and founder Tariq Cherif repeated Carti’s claims.  
“When I got back from Thailand, Playboi Carti called me,” he said in an Instagram video Sunday. “We started talking about the album. He’s like, ‘Yo I’m play that s### at Rolling Loud. You saw him post it, I don’t know what he gonna do, he told you he’s gonna play that s###.” 
Cherif also revealed he heard the album via Facetime before hinting at guest appearances. 
“I heard it on FaceTime,” he added. “That s### sounded amazing. He got another one, with that guy he got another song with, and OUUUUU that s### is crazy.” 
Nonetheless, many Playboi Carti fans were disappointed to only hear a few cuts from the album. Check out some of the reactions below.
