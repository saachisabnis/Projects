Rick Ross was one of the many artists who came at Drake earlier this year after Kendrick Lamar kicked things off – but he says there was no greater conspiracy at play.
Ross was one of a handful of guests at Shannon Sharpe and Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson’s Nightcap Summer Sessions: LIVE from Houston show on Sunday (August 25). During his time on stage, the Florida native was asked about the intense war that included not only himself and K.dot but Future, Metro Boomin, A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd and more — a war that Drizzy dubbed a “20-v-1” in his song “Push Ups.”

“I thought all y’all was cool?” Sharpe asked.
“I’ma be honest. On some rap shit – it was no conspiracies,” Ross said simply. “Rozay name was said [so] I’ma jump off the porch. That’s what I do. I’ma jump off the porch and I’ma have some fun and that’s what I did. I had some fun.”

After Future and Kendrick Lamar dissed Drake on Future and Metro’s We Don’t Trust You, the follow-up We Still Don’t Trust You was just as loaded.
On “Show of Hands,” Rocky seemingly raps about having a relationship with Drake’s baby mother Sophie Brussaux before she welcomed their son, Adonis.

“N-ggas swear they bitch the baddest, I just bagged the worst one/ N-ggas in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin’?/ I smashed before you birthed son, Flacko hit it first, son,” he spits.
He also appears to throws shade at Drake’s For All the Dogs LP: “Still don’ trust you, it’s always us, never them/ Heard you dropped your latest shit/Funny how it just came and went (Ha ha ha)”

Drake had seemingly been baiting the Harlem rapper over his relationship with Rihanna, who Drizzy was once rumored to have a fling with.
On the For All the Dogs track “Another Late Night,” he rapped: “I ain’t Pretty Flacko, bitch, this shit get really Rocky/ Damn, what? Dirty how I did him in the Wraith.”

The Weeknd, who features several times across We Still Don’t Trust You, also appears to vent some anger towards his former friend on the song “All to Myself.”
For his part, Ross actually coined the nickname “BBL Drizzy” and enjoyed trolling the OVO rapper online amid the many disses. He was later jumped by Drake fans during an appearance in Toronto, though he remained unfazed.
