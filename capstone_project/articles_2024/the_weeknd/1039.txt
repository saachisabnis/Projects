Director of Content for both Fun 107 and 1420 WBSM, Rock began his radio career in Boston as a 16-year-old intern for "Rock and Roll Hall of Famer" Dale Dorman.  He cracked the mic for the first time on his 18th birthday as a freshman broadcaster at Syracuse University's legendary Z-89.  Rock has hosted radio shows in Boston, Syracuse, Connecticut, and New Hampshire...and came to Fun 107 back in 1995.  He's hung out with some of the world's biggest names, including Tom Brady, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, The Weeknd, The Jonas Brothers, and Rihanna.  Michael Rock has hosted live broadcasts from the Grammy Awards, Atlantis in the Bahamas, Universal Studios Florida and Red Sox Spring Training.  But the most important live broadcast he's ever done was during one of his weekly Saturday Night Hotmixx shows from the Jukebox in New Bedford. That's where he met his wife, Cyndi. They now live in Mattapoisett with their two children.
