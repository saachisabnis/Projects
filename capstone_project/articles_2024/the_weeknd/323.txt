Hailing its beginning in 1993 as a must-visit celebrity eatery in Los Angeles, Victor Drai (an SMU grad) established his namesake powerhouse brand. In 1997, he debuted Drai's Restaurant and After hours, a Las Vegas nightlife institution located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, followed by the reinvention of Drai's Nightclub and Beachclub in 2016.
To date, the venue has played home to some of music's most dynamic talent including The Weeknd and Chris Brown.
Upon entering the newly built 15,000 square foot complex, guests will discover an upscale supper club with French-inspired cuisine. At the center of the dining room, a stunning performance stage will spotlight cabaret-style live entertainment.
Drai's Dallas will offer a limited number of Founding Memberships that offer a suite of VIP benefits for the upcoming Drai's Dallas as well as Drai's Las Vegas, including priority reservations and special invite-only events.
