During his Spotify’s Billions Club Live performance in Los Angeles on Tuesday (December 17), the Weeknd delivered a career-spanning, hits-filled set for his “OG XO” fans while also sharing what 2025 holds for the chart-topping musician. “2024 is almost done, but 2025 we’ve got some new s**t coming up,” the Weeknd announced from the stage to the 2,000 lucky audience members who packed the intimate venue. “New album, new tour, new movie, new everything — we’re shutting this s**t down.” The announcement of a forthcoming tour was a revelation, since the only official live performance the Weeknd has scheduled in 2025 is his massive one-night-only show at the Rose Bowl on January 25, the day after his new record, Hurry Up Tomorrow, drops. The Weeknd finished the set with his new collaboration with Anitta, “São Paulo,” and told the crowd, “I’ll see you in 2025, it’s going to be a big year.” (People)
