Did we enjoy Usher‘s halftime performance at Super Bowl 58 on Sunday? Uh, that’d be a “Yeah!”
The eight-time Grammy Award winner lit the stage at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium on Sunday with fiery performances of his biggest hits, including “Caught Up,” “You Don’t Have to Call,” “Love in This Club,” “Confessions,” “Let It Burn,” “You Got It Bad” and more. There was stripping, there were rollerskating, there was a lot — and it was all excellent.
And because no Super Bowl halftime show would be complete without a special guest or two, Usher welcomed Alicia Keys to the stage for a surprise performance of their song “My Boo,” followed by H.E.R. for a lesson in proper shredding. And you didn’t think Ludacris and Lil Jon would miss a chance to join “Ersher” at the Super Bowl, did you?

Watch clips of Usher’s halftime performance at Super Bowl 58, which we’ll update with full video when it becomes available, below:
The R&B superstar is coming off a wildly successful Las Vegas residency, which ran from July 2022 to December 2023. He released his ninth studio album Coming Home earlier this month, marking his first full-length musical project in eight years.
Usher was just one of several big names providing non-athletic entertainment at this year’s Super Bowl. Country queen Reba McEntire kicked off the big game with a killer performance of the national anthem, preceded by Post Malone with his unique spin on “America the Beautiful” and Andra Day with the expectedly stunning “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”
Music producer Kaskade also served as the Super Bowl’s first-ever in-game DJ. The gig originally belonged to Tiësto, who had to back out just three days before the big game due to a “personal family emergency.”
With this performance, Usher joins a long line of top-tier artists to command the Super Bowl halftime stage. Recent headliners have included Rihanna (2023); Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar (2022); The Weeknd (2021); and Shakira and Jennifer Lopez (2020).

Where is Justin Bieber!
I was surprised that he didn’t come out seeing as how he is his protégé! He’s in Vegas as well with his pastor lol
Apparently Bieber declined the invitation. He stated he would prefer to be the headliner. So. He is angling for a solo spot.
Wow. If that’s true the he’s selfish af!
Who cares? Usher did a fantastic job, and has 30 years of songs. He sang, danced, performed on skates, and you’re looking for Bieber? Next.
That was a great performance by Usher!! Very entertaining! When he came out on rollerskates, very impressive. It’s been a long time since I enjoyed a half time show that much!!
I thought Usher did well. That man can still dance and he still looks the same!!!! And it’s always great to see Alicia Keys. Real women have curves ⏳ 
I did laugh at his shirt being anatomically, correct 🤣
It was a solid halftime show. He went a little too heavy on ballads for too long a stretch in the middle. But overall it was fine. Better than some other recent halftime shows like Rihanna’s last year or Justin Timberlake’s from a few years back, both of which I thought were underwhelming and boring. Ludacris and Lil Jon brought some good energy too. And Alicia Keys sounded great.
It was one of the better halftime shows in recent years. Loved seeing Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Ludacris & Lil Jon performing with him.
Usher was great! I loved it!
Great show! Worth waiting for.
It got better as it went, but Usher seemed a bit labored–especially with the sound being off. Of course, it is tremendously difficult to dance with high energy and hit all of the notes. Much love from Tennessee, ya’ll!
Usher’s halftime performance was one of the best I’ve ever seen!!! Loved it.
What’s memorable? They did part of it on roller skates.  Big deal.
Lies. We know you can’t sing, and skate at the same time. That is the big deal. Next.
Thought it was entertaining, but too Many ballads. Could have done with Alicia Keys. I like her, but just brought the moment down with the song choices. Usher should have song More – great upbeat, catchy song that would have been great for a night like tonight. But overall, he did a decent job though the sound seemed kind of off. Music overpowered the voices.
Have done without Alicia Keys…
It wasn’t bad. It was worse – completely forgettable
Completely agree with you!  Can’t understand how anyone could comment that it was the best half time show, or a great half time show.  Like you said, UNFORGETTABLE.  It bombed.
One of the best in recent history. Period.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I think that Usher’s performance was at least a 5.
      Usher is a terrific dancer.
Meh..to many ballads for this type of performance…Yeah was the best part and even that was just ok.
Well all this did was prove Usher only has one great song (Yeah!) in his entire oeuvre. Definition of a banger
Kind of felt strange watching the halftime show, it didn’t have the OMG! moments that other performers brought to the table. It wasn’t risky, it wasn’t as cool or had many watercooler moments.
The LIES. One great song? Just say you don’t know Usher’s music, and go.
Usher has 30 years of hits.
Usher sang, dance, and performed on skates.
DJ Got Us Falling In Love and Without You would have really helped the set.
IT WAS GREAT
Loved Usher Luda Lil Jon! Now enough r&b…
Awesome show! Usher killed it. He sang, danced, did his number on skates. He was truly amazing! People are hating on Usher, when they like artists who can barely sing, and can’t dance. Get outta here, lol!
Usher acting like MJ with his moves? What’s  with the white glove please bring back Michael this clown Usher not so good!
Be pretty hard to bring back MJ don’t you think?
So it’s okay for Usher to show his nipples on live TV….
Jason Kelce did it.
I like Usher but he was sweating so much. He wore a white glove and moon walked. The Michael Jackson days are over. Learn a new step or two.
It’s called a tribute. Duh.
It really didn’t have the wow factor, wasn’t impressed 😕
He sang and danced greatly, but the song choices really made the set fall flat. He could have used DJ Got Us Falling In Love and Without You. It needed another high energy number, other than Yeah.
There was a lot going on. For Vegas, it was a good production. Not my cup of tea. Has Taylor Swift ever done halftime? It would have been a good year for that.
Oh God, no. Enough already. Taylor Swift overdose.
Cheap talentless hacks
I guarantee you can’t sing, and dance on rollerskates, like Usher did.
