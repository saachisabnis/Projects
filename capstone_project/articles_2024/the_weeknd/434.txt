Third time's the charm! ✨
Hi, hello, Anitta just hit the VMAs stage for the third year in a row (!!!) with a 🔥🔥🔥 medley of “Savage Funk” and “Alegria.” She also premiered her new track, “Paradise,” and brought out legendary guests like Fat Joe, DJ Khaled, and Tiago PZK. Of course, no Anitta performance is complete without an iconic outfit and booty-shaking—and both were present during her slot on stage.
Days ahead of the VMAs, the Brazilian hitmaker joined The Weeknd during a performance in São Paulo, where they performed their collaboration from his upcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, for the very first time. 
“Anitta is a great friend. What she sent was so awesome that we created the song,” The Weeknd said of his collaborator during an interview with Billboard Brasil. “We knew it was too special to just play on stage. We saw great potential in the song and found the beat, which is the heart of the show.” 
Anitta also told the outlet, “I wrote some verses as a joke and never imagined they would become serious. Suddenly, I received the finished song. I loved it! I felt very honored and flattered... I’ve always been a big fan of his and his work. I never imagined this would happen, and now it’s a dream come true. It’s a little more Brazilian funk, as promised, around the world.”
ICYMI, the musician made her VMAs debut in 2022 with a high-energy performance of her No. 1 song, “Envolver.” Last year, she also hit the stage with Tomorrow X Together to sing their track “Back for More” *and* made VMAs history as the first K-Pop band to cross genres at the awards show.
Anitta’s commitment to consistently slaying at the VMAs is honestly aspirational...so, excuse me while I take some notes. 🤓
