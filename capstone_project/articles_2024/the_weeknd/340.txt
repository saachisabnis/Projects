The Weeknd has teased a potential new collaboration with the tech giant Apple, but he didn’t give too many details as to what that collaboration would entail.
Taking to his Instagram Stories on Saturday (June 1), the “I Can’t Feel My Face” singer posted a photo full of framed pictures of the Apple logo on the wall above a white couch, implying that he was at the company’s headquarters.

His caption only shared three emojis —bthe googly-eyed emoji, the musical notes emoji, and the film camera emoji — all of which suggested that he’d be recording and taping a new music performance.
However, that has not been confirmed, as of this writing.

Late last month, The Weeknd shared another social media post that had fans speculating about the “end” of his career.
On May 24, the singer took to his Instagram Story where he quoted a fan page’s tweet about his live performance of his hit single “Save Your Tears” at the 2021 Billboard Awards. The TV hit saw him walking along a road while singing, as rows of cars came up behind him, parting ways right before they hit him.

“There was a lot of trust with those cars,” read the quote. “He didn’t seem nervous at all, which really weirded us out, because these cars were just barreling by him and he was calm, kept his composure, walked slow and just didn’t look back. It was kind of amazing.”
The Instagram Story post included a static shot from the performance, as well as the statement, “the end is near.”

Aside from hinting in 2022 that his last two albums, After Hours and DawnFM, were part of a trilogy; and another cryptic Instagram post earlier this year, The Weeknd has not been very forthcoming about his next project.
One collaborator, however, has at least confirmed that the Toronto native is back in the studio.
