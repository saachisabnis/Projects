The Weeknd is getting ready to release his FINAL album!
According to Rolling Stone, the singer says that his upcoming album  "Hurry Up Tomorrow" will be his last! The album is due to drop January 24th!
They note in a statement about the album he said, "Yesterday was fourteen years ago… We held our breath, falling into a shimmering sea in the after hours of the night… Attempted to cleanse the wounds with melodies and lights, a bulletproof bandage to shield what lies beneath,” read the post. “In a place where the seasons never changed, where time ceased to exist. But therein lays the problem. Today has felt like an endless spin, I keep distorting the truth, immune to the dizziness, numb to the nausea. What lies beneath — screams in silence.”
Rolling Stone notes that this will be his final album. It will be accompanied by a film starring himself Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan.
