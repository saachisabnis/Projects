Yolanda Hadid is reflecting on her summer of love with her fiancé, Joseph Jingoli, and her family.
“💙Summer 2024 has come and gone…” Hadid, 60, captioned a 19-slide Instagram carousel Friday, which featured photos of Jingoli spending quality time with her, her three kids and her one grandchild.
The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum shares daughters Gigi Hadid, 29, and Bella Hadid, 27, as well as son Anwar Hadid, 25, with her first husband, Mohamed Hadid, 75.
Meanwhile, Gigi co-parents daughter Khai, almost 4, with her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik, 31.
Yolanda and her loved ones appear to have spent part of the summer in her native Holland, as they were photographed sightseeing, enjoying a boat ride and riding bikes through the lush country.
In one particularly sweet snap, Jingoli was seen smiling at Bella, who grinned back as she flashed a thumbs up.
“So cute momma🤍🫶🏼🤍🫶🏼,” she gushed beneath the post.
Yolanda’s upload included shots from a relaxing day at a beach, tender moments on her Pennsylvania farm and mirror selfies with her glam squad.
She made sure to include a picture of Jingoli riding a horse, likely in Texas where they share a home.
In a profile on the mansion in question published last week, Architectural Digest referred to the construction company CEO as Yolanda’s “fiancé.”
She later told People that he proposed during a trip to Holland two years ago.
The model and Jingoli met in Pennsylvania.
According to AD, he “whisked her away” to Fort Worth, Texas, for their first date: a horse show. They celebrated their fifth anniversary in January.
“That trip was really my first introduction to Texas,” she told the outlet. “We went straight to Fort Worth, where there was a huge horse show with hundreds and hundreds of real, authentic cowboys. It was like being dropped right into a Western movie.”
Yolanda, a horse lover and rider, said she and Jingoli returned to the area often as their romance blossomed.
Eventually, the former Bravolebrity fell in love with the Lone Star State’s “down-to-earth” culture, so she and her beau established a home base.
Per AD, the couple found the perfect wooded plot overlooking a river and built their dream home: “a single-story, horseshoe-shaped dwelling.”
And unlike the pristine Beverly Hills palace she shared with her second husband, David Foster, Yolanda is OK with her Western sanctuary looking lived-in.
“I want people to be able to come in and wear their cowboy boots,” she insisted. “I’m not going to worry about mud on the floors. It had to be casual.”
Bella — who appears to have a great relationship with her soon-to-be stepdad — seemingly met Jingoli about a month after he began dating her mother.
In February 2019, a spy at the model’s then-boyfriend The Weeknd’s party told us Yolanda showed up with “a new guy” with whom she was seen “canoodling.”
“It looked like it was Bella’s first time meeting him,” our insider spilled. “She shook his hand. It seemed very formal.”
Bella, for her part, is now dating her own cowboy, Adan Banuelos.
