Electronic music duo DIsclosure will bring the performances on Glastonbury's Other Stage to a close on Saturday night at Worthy Farm. Surrey-born brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence released their first single, Offline Dexterity, in 2010, when both were still teenagers.
Latch was the single that really launched their careers in the UK - and that of singer Sam Smith, whose vocals featured on the track. They have since sold over seven million albums and been nominated for a string of Grammys, including Best Dance/Electronica Album for their debut studio album, Settle, in June 2013.
Disclosure have also collaborated with the likes of Lorde and The Weeknd and sold out Madison Square Garden in New York. They have previously headlined Glastonburyâ€™s Other Stage as well as Reading & Leeds, Parklife, and All Points East, and played huge sets at Coachella and Bonnaroo festivals.
