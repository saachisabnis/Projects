Kanye West took a sample from Ozzy Osbourne for his new, unreleased album called “Vultures” without getting it cleared.
Osbourne is furious. He denied Kanye permission because “he is an antisemite.” Osbourne’s famous wife, Sharon, is Jewish and so are their children and grandchildren.
Good for Ozzy! No one should clear samples for that album.
I told you previously that West said he couldn’t get clearance from The Weeknd either.
Without clearances on samples, the “Vultures” will not see light of day. It is bootlegged around the internet, and anyone stupid enough to buy a ticket can hear it tonight, live at UBS Arena on Long Island.
. @kanyewest ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF “WAR PIG” FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY. HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM…
