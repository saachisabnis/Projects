As Travis Scott‘s global Circus Maximus Tour draws to a close, the Utopia-centered headlining series has set a variety of new records. Reports indicate that the rapper sold more than 1.5 million tickets, setting a new milestone for the hip-hop world. The tour has also been marked as the biggest rap tour of 2024 regarding the number of tickets sold. Additionally, Scott is the rapper to sell out MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and SoFi Stadium in California. 
Scott surpassed the attendance record for a major concert at Allianz System in Sydney, Australia after performing to a crowd of 41,811 people, per last week. A cumulative audience of 78,897 attendees witnessed Scott’s performance over the course of two nights at the stadium. The tour was an unforgettable experience for fans as the rapper performed songs from his latest album and his classics. Following a series of performances in Australia this week, Scott and his team will wrap up the Circus Maximus Tour at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, on Halloween. 
Hot 97 previously reported that Travis Scott expressed gratitude to The Weeknd on stage earlier this week for including him in his first tour. The two performed their collaborations “SKELETONS” and “Pray 4 Love,” both of which struck a chord with the audience. Scott and The Weeknd have a long history of collaborations, reaching big success. The two are seen on stage lighting up the crowd, leading to Scott voicing a warming message, “Shoutout to my XO brothers. I love y’all for life.”
