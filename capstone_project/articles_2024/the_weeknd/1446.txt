Kid Cudi appeared to respond to Kanye West's recent comments about influencing the sound of hip-hop over the past 20 years. Following Kanye's claim that his 2008 album "808s & Heartbreak" inspired artists like The Weeknd, Drake, Travis Scott, Future, and Young Thug, Kid Cudi posted a cryptic tweet featuring a screenshot from his Wikipedia page.
The excerpt highlighted Cudi's role in influencing Kanye's creation of "808s & Heartbreak" and included a quote from Kanye acknowledging their joint pioneering of a new musical style. Despite their ups and downs, including a recent reconciliation at a listening party, Cudi seemed to subtly assert his influence in response to Kanye's claims.
