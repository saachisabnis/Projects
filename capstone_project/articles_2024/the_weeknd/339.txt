Drake is continuing to clown Metro Boomin. This time, the rapper uses a meme from the film Drumline to get his point across.
On Monday (April 15), Drake trolled Young Metro on his Instagram Story by sharing a scene from the 2002 film Drumline. In the clip, Metro's face has been artificially placed over Nick Cannon's character, as the producer wails on some drums amid a panel of judges.
The meme was likely a reference to Drake's dig against Metro on his latest diss track, on which he raps, "Metro shut yo h*e a** up and make some drums, n***a." Metro has yet to respond to any of Drake's trolling, but he did claim that he's a part of the Biggest 3 alongside The Weeknd and Future.
Drake's relentless trolling comes after someone leaked a reference track implying Lil Yachty was the one who actually penned Drizzy's song "Jumbotron S**t Poppin." The leaked recording finds Lil Boat rapping nearly the same bars as what Drake rapped on the record, and DJ Akademiks theorized that Young Metro was more than likely the one who sprung the leak.
