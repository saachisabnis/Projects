	You know who Metro Boomin actually trusts? His fans who listened to his and Future‘s albums We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, both of which recently debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 

	“back2back #1 albums, thanks to everyone for listening! #wetrustyou,” he wrote on Instagram Monday (April 22) underneath still shots of him and Pluto as well as him and The Weeknd from the “We Still Don’t Trust You” music video. The album’s title track debuted at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 (dated April 27), leading the 13 other tracks that entered the all-genre songs tally that can be found in this graphic. 

	










We Don’t Trust You debuted atop the all-genre albums tally three weeks ago (dated April 6), with 251,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending March 28, according to Luminate. Meanwhile, We Still Don’t Trust You topped the chart this week, with 127,500 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending April 18. The albums mark Metro’s fourth and fifth No. 1 albums and Future’s ninth and 10th No. 1 albums.

	The three-week gap between both chart-topping sets marks the shortest gap between new No. 1s by an artist since Future replaced himself at No. 1 in 2017 in successive weeks with his self-titled album (March 11, 2017, chart) and HNDRXX (March 18, 2017), both of which debuted at No. 1. Future also now ties Elvis Presley and Eminem for the fifth-most No. 1 albums and is in fourth place among rappers, after Jay-Z (14), Drake (13) and Ye (11).
