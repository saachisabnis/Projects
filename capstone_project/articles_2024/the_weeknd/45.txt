Rosé scores a double win on the U.K. singles chart this week, as her latest track “Number One Girl” debuts at No. 84. The second official single from her forthcoming solo album Rosie, expected this Friday (December 6), is making itself known on charts worldwide, though it doesn’t reach the same heights as her recent hit “Apt.” with Bruno Mars. Both tracks are featured among the most-consumed songs in the U.K. this frame, and with her latest success, Rosé ties one of her Blackpink bandmates when it comes to the record books.
Throughout her solo career, Rosé has now sent three tracks to the U.K.’s singles chart. Before “Apt.” and “Number One Girl,” she first appeared on the tally years ago with “On the Ground,” which peaked at No. 43. She only recently surpassed that milestone with “Apt.,” which benefits immensely from the inclusion of Mars.
Rosé’s latest entry places her alongside her bandmate Jennie, as both are now tied for the second-most U.K. chart hits among solo female artists from the K-pop world. Not all of their music fits strictly within the K-pop genre, but the Blackpink members are best known for their contributions to the global popularity of the style, and they are still closely associated with it.
Jennie has also amassed three solo hits in the U.K., including “You & Me” (No. 39), “Mantra” (No. 37), and her collaboration with The Weeknd and Lily Rose Depp, “One of the Girls” (No. 21). All three tracks cracked the top 40, and Jennie holds the distinction of being the only South Korean soloist to collect that many top 40 successes.
Still, both Rosé and Jennie are trailing Lisa, another member of Blackpink, who leads all female solo K-pop stars, with four solo U.K. chart hits. Lisa has appeared on the list with “Lalisa” (No. 68), “Money” (No. 46), “Rockstar” (No. 49), and her 2024 collaboration with Rosalia, “New Woman” (No. 55). The singer still owns this record, but both Jennie and Rosé are quickly catching up.
Rosé continues to shine this week in the United Kingdom, as her hit “Apt.” holds steady at No. 3, down just one spot from its No. 2 peak. The Mars collaboration remains within striking distance of becoming one of the rare K-pop tracks to dominate the U.K. chart. While “Number One Girl” doesn’t come close to such heights, its entry onto the chart still marks another major career achievement for the singer.
“Number One Girl” performs even better on other U.K.-based rankings, debuting at No. 11 on the Official Singles Downloads chart and No. 14 on the Official Singles Sales chart this time around. She might earn new wins in a week or so and make history once more, after Rosie is released.
