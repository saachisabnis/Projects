A pair of support acts will be special guests when Rag'n'Bone Man performs in Inverness this summer.
The top artist will be delighting music fans at the Big Top Under Canvas at Bught Park on Sunday, July 7.
And joining him on the line-up are Scottish band Shambolics, and Josh Barry.
The Shambolics formed in 2018, and in 2022 the five-piece toured all around the UK, ending in Glasgow with a sold-out show. This year is kicking off with the release of their debut album ‘Dreams, Schemes and Young Teams’.
During the pandemic, the Shambolics showcased a series of classic cover versions including Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Everywhere’, The Weeknd’s ‘Blinding Lights’, ABBA’s ‘Mamma Mia’ and The Stones ’Sympathy for the Devil’; finding a raft of new fans with their uplifting reworkings.
Josh Barry, meanwhile, will be warming up the crowd just before Rag’n’Bone Man takes to the stage. He is bringing back soul and funk influences from music industry icons, taking inspiration from Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, and James Brown, right through to Michael Jackson and Bob Dylan.
Over the past decade, Josh Barry has featured on dance hits with the likes of Gorgon City, Sonny Fodera, The Martinez Brothers & Rudimental. In addition to this, he recently collaborated and featured alongside Nile Rogers and Wh0 on their song, ‘Better Day’.
In 2021, Josh Barry released his latest debut EP, ‘Art & Soul’. Since then, he has put together a full band dubbed ‘The Broken Hearts’ who are now taking Josh Barry’s incredible voice and song-writing to new heights of live performance.
Tickets to see Rag’n’Bone Man, plus special guests Josh Barry and Shambolics, live at Bught Park on Sunday, July 7 can be purchased online from ticketline.co.uk and in person from Caffery’s Menswear in the Eastgate Shopping Centre.
