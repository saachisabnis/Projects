	The rest of the Top 5 remains a Carpenter stronghold as well. “Espresso” continues to brew success and is predicted to hold steady at No. 2, while “Please Please Please” won’t have to beg to hold its spot at No. 4. Sabrina’s Short n’ Sweet era has taken over the U.K. charts, with multiple singles continuing to perform strongly.

	Meanwhile, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars are climbing the chart with their lounge-pop duet “Die With A Smile,” which could break into the Top 5 for the first time at No. 5. 

	Fresh entries also shake things up this week, as The Weeknd’s euphoric new track “Dancing In The Flames” is poised to debut at No. 9, making it the highest new entry of the week.

	Tate McRae is also gaining ground with her pop hit “It’s Ok, I’m Ok,” expected to debut just outside the Top 10 at No. 11, while Playboi Carti’s “All Red” is eyeing a No. 13 debut, potentially marking his first solo Top 20 entry in the U.K.

	Elsewhere, U.S. soul singer Teddy Swims is set for another chart success with his single “Bad Dreams,” aiming for No. 15, which would be his third Top 20 hit in the U.K. 

	Meanwhile, Charli XCX looks to make a comeback with a remix of her track “Talk Talk” featuring Troye Sivan, which could re-enter the chart at No. 20.

	With only a few days until the official rankings, it looks like Sabrina Carpenter’s latest single still holds its flavor and will likely continue to reign supreme when the U.K. Singles Chart is updated on Friday (Sept. 20).
