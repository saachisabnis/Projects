Home    Forums    Music    2026 Grammy Predictions
Like I said before, I wish that this year they would increase the number of nominees in the general field to about 10 to accommodate new artists and a lot of the music that’s going to be released. To be honest, I don’t think I’ll be hooked on the 2025 Grammy Awards because there’s nothing new, nothing that exciting. 
The Latin GRAMMYs are inclusive with all Latin American countries and that’s why all Big 4 categories are 10 and never needed to be deconstructed because the artist demand is huge. In 2022 I think it reached 12 in RECORD OF THE YEAR and SONG OF THE YEAR.
With that being said, I’d love for Gaga to move on from Jazz. This is her 3rd now. And her fans clearly don’t enjoy it that much to be honest.

I’m just an admirer but I love the Jazz albums more actually, they’re good for practicing the piano. Harlequin is already my best Gaga album.
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
Keep it at 8 but bring back the committees
Horrible idea. The committees were the worst things the Grammys ever did. Giving a small group of people the chance to do whatever they want with nominations is just unnecessary. I say keep it at 8 on a straight vote and just switch the final voting system to preferential ballot. 
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time”
Hard disagree. Going pure popular vote is making the General field slots akin to the People’s Choice Awards, not actually awarding the best artistic merit. Theres already a Billboard Music Awards, VMAs, iHeart Music Awards and People’s Choice to award the same 5 richest people in the room. 
The Grammys are supposed to have an element of critical acclaim and respect for artistry, mixed in with the hitmakers. The committees are the best way to ensure some degree of quality control is being done by actually listening, rather than lazy alphabetical name checking.
Yes, The Weeknd was right, the old system was corrupt. So fix it. Rotate panel membership, ban label & agency employees, etc.  But there has to be focus on substance. Look at the assumed nominees for AOTY this year. Half of them were predicted before their albums were even released. THAT IN ITSELF IS ALSO CORRUPTION.
In an industry with genres like rock, hip-hop, R&B, dance, country, jazz, gospel, folk, reggae and multiple Latin subgenres, that ALL the best crafted releases over 365 days were coincidentally only from the pop music genres? There wasn’t ANYTHING better from the wide span of genres? Bullshit. It’s a broken system that is bought and paid for. It needs fixing to ensure excellence has a fair shot among the sea of advertising dollars.

Get real!  The Grammys are NOT about artistic merit and critical acclaim.  Pure delusion.  The Grammy Awards now are on the same level as the American Music Awards, Billboard Awards, and Video Music Awards.

No shit, Sherlock. This is why I’m saying they need a creative overhaul in their process. Thank you for proving my point.

The acclaim is yet another example of fraud and corruption. Charli XCX has an exaggerated acclaim for a song full of voice effects. Live she sounds very scary.
BTS could potentially be dropping their post-military reunion track and/or album right before submission closes. They’ll have timing, numbers, and the dramatic storyline on their side. I expect nominations for them if it happens.

I believe so, she wouldn’t have released it in the Harlequin album if it hurt her chances of winning an Oscar or Grammy.
Honey, do NOT bring back the committees. They are the reason why Taylor Swift has four undeserved Album of the Year Grammys. Also, return the nominees to five due to lack of strong contenders. 
Midnights won without a committee, and that was far from being her most deserved win, so I don’t see your point.
The reason you don’t want committees is that they can help cancel out alphabetical order voting preference, and alphabetical order is the only reason Christina Aguilera has 21 nominations.
They can’t reduce the nominees to five while there is a strong alphabetical order voting preference, because too many worthy submissions are missing out due to poor alphabetical placement. By allowing more nominees, those artists still have a chance.
The problem they had, was that the committees had too much power, ultimately choosing all the nominees.
The Grammys can still manipulate the nominations in other ways of course, deciding on how many nominees will be accepted, who is eligible and who will be moved to another category.
The committees were supposedly created to avoid another Tony Bennet type situation winning with a live album but the truth is they didn’t save us from equally questionable choices all these years. Leave the direct vote for 5 nominees, let the committee add 3 and let the final vote be ranked, done.
It's me... Hi

omg autotune shaming is soooo 2010 bffr
Get fucking real, delusional Swiftie!  Alphabetical order is NOT the only reason Christina Aguilera has 21 Grammy nominations.  Pure delusion.  Xtina’s talent is the reason why she gets nominated.  I am convinced users are smoked out.  Also, there is no such thing as alphabetical placement.  That is something people made up.  Furthermore, the blue-ribbon commitee is responsible for blocking artists and setting up an easy win for Folklore.  In addition, the committees are responsible for shitty Fearless and 1989 wins over more deserving artists.  It is time to cancel the Grammy Awards.
Leave the direct vote for 5 nominees, let the committee add 3 and let the final vote be ranked, done.
Finally someone making reasonable sense around here!
