If you couldn’t tell, there is an organized coalitions to get Drake out of here. Drake is currently embroiled in beef with Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross, Future, The Weeknd, Metro Boomin, and Ye, the latter of which states a conversation happened about “the elimination of Drake.”
Also, on The Download podcast, Ye stated he got a call from Future, which led to his “Like That” remix.
“[Future] called me and I went to the studio and laid that. We went through the creative process of adding the chords and called the Hooligans out in London to get on the joint,” Ye said. “Everybody was very, very energized about the elimination of Drake.”
