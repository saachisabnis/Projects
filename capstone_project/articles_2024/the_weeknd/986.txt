Legal action looms over Drake as Tupac's legal team threatens a lawsuit regarding the unauthorized use of an AI-generated Tupac voice.

Drake's latest diss track, "Taylor Made," featuring an AI-generated Tupac soundalike, has stirred controversy and drawn the attention of Tupac Shakur's legal team.
While the track has been received enthusiastically by Drake's fans, it has also sparked concerns over copyright infringement and the ethical use of AI-generated voices in music.
Billboard's report sheds light on the impending legal battle, indicating that Tupac's estate is not only displeased with Drake's unauthorized use of Tupac's voice but also considers it a disrespectful exploitation of Tupac's legacy.
Led by litigator Howard King, the legal team is poised to challenge Drake's actions in court if the song remains accessible online.
This case raises significant questions about the music industry's intersection of technology, artistic expression, and intellectual property rights.
King expressed profound disappointment and dismay regarding the unauthorized utilization of Tupac's voice and persona. He emphasized that the Estate would never have been approved for such use.

In recent weeks, several rap artists, including Lamar, Drake, and J. Cole, have engaged in a series of pointed musical exchanges, delighting audiences and stirring controversy. These exchanges come after years of underlying tensions, particularly regarding claims to supremacy within the genre.
Future's latest release, "Like That," featuring Lamar, prompted a response from Drake with his track "Push Ups." In this song, Drake humorously addresses Lamar's stature, shoe size, and past dealings with Top Dawg Entertainment.
Drake didn't wait for a response; instead, he released "Taylor Made" on April 19th, causing a stir.
While the song garnered attention for referencing Taylor Swift, it truly caught people's attention by incorporating voices from deceased West Coast rappers who were not part of the ongoing disputes.
In response, Snoop posted a video on Instagram with a range of emojis, suggesting a mix of reactions, including amusement.
From an outsider's perspective, the situation may appear trivial, but "Taylor Made" is a prominent instance emerging from the surge in AI-generated music, sparking discussions on record labels' strategies to address this trend.
Intriguingly, Drake has previously publicly voiced opposition to AI-generated music, yet he appears to have connections to "Heart on My Sleeve," a viral track credited to the anonymous TikTok user ghostwriter977.
The estate of Tupac Shakur has demanded that "Taylor Made" be removed within 24 hours. Should it emerge that Drake created the song without their consent, its removal seems imminent.
Despite the attention-grabbing nature of this feud, Drake may be prepared to pursue legal action to defend his position.
