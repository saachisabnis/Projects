The aftermath of Drake and Kendrick Lamar's conflict is full of eye-popping drama from Rick Ross' response to a fresh leak that fuels more rumors about Drizzy's alleged dependency on ghostwriters. In the early hours of Monday morning, April 15, numerous bloggers received a file from a "random Atlanta number" that contains Lil Yachty's reference track for Drake's "Jumbotron Sh*t Poppin" from his and 21 Savage's joint album Her Loss. Yachty is listed as a producer, composer and lyricist on the track so the leak appears to be the real deal. However, the track is sparking plenty of controversy among fans. 
Some fans are convinced that Metro Boomin leaked the track in the heat of the civil war against Drizzy. The reference comes in the midst of Drake's beef with Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, The Weeknd and Rick Ross. Over the weekend, Drake formally responded to all the shots fired on both of Pluto and Young Metro's joint albums in his own diss track "Push Ups." On the record, the 37-year-old artist takes aim at Kendrick by alleging his former label Top Dawg Entertainment is extorting him, and alluding to his wife Whitney. Meanwhile, Drizzy told Metro to "shut your hoe ass up and make drums" and tore Abel and his XO crew to shreds. Abel was the first to react to a leak of Drake's diss and Rozay stepped up next with his response "Champagne Moments." Soon after both disses circulated around the Internet, an alleged diss track believed to be from Kendrick Lamar began to spread. However, it was quickly determined that the song was made by AI. Listen to Lil Yachty's entire reference track below.
