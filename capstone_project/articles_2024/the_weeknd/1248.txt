Trey Edward Shults’ next movie, a mysterious project starring The Weeknd, Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan, officially has a name and has been acquired by Lionsgate.
The upcoming film’s name is Hurry Up Tomorrow and will mark the final chapter in The Weeknd’s — real name Abel Tesfaye — trilogy of albums. The movie will act as an extension of his upcoming album of the same name and will be written and directed by Shults (Waves).
Rumors of the project had been surfacing since earlier this year, when it was first reported that the movie was in development. At the time, reports had mentioned that both Shults and The Weekend had been working on the project in secret for months. 
It’s unclear if any other cast will be featured in the project besides Tesfaye, Ortega, and Keoghan as of yet. The film is described as a “musically driven psychological thriller.” A report from World of Reel earlier this year noted that rumors at the time suggested the film was a loose remake of the 1990 film Misery and would see Ortega playing a deranged stalker of The Weeknd.
In July 2023, Ortega shared a photo of a mysterious house on Instagram that looks similar to the one used in Misery, potentially hinting at the upcoming film.
