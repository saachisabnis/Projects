The Weeknd and Playboi Carti’s high-profile collaboration “Timeless” enjoyed a strong opening day on Spotify.
The song, notably, earned #1 on the US Spotify Chart for Friday, September 27 courtesy of its 3.5 million opening-day American streams. A worldwide count of 10.0 million concurrently yielded a #2 bow on the Global listing.
“Timeless” entered the market two weeks after both artists released solo singles. Playboi Carti’s “All Red” launched at #1 on the US chart for September 13, while The Weeknd’s “Dancing In The Flames” started at #10.
Debuted during The Weeknd’s performance in São Paulo, “Timeless” joins “Dancing In The Flames” on the upcoming album “Hurry Up Tomorrow.”
