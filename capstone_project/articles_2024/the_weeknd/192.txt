Drake has dropped more previously unreleased music and behind-the-scenes footage as part of his 100 Gigs content dump.
Perhaps the most notable part of the release is a snippet of a previously unheard song from his 2013 album Nothing Was The Same, which is played by Drizzy’s longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib in the studio.

“Do you remember us, do you remember how that go? / ‘Cause you just told me put my hands around your throat / You so aggressive now, you used to like it slow / But you changed, girl, nothing was the same, girl / Can’t fight that feeling,” 6 God sings on the outtake.
Check it out below.

Another highlight is a video of Drake and Kanye West hanging out after the Chicago rap legend made a surprise appearance at OVO Fest in 2013.
The clip shows the two frenemies warmly embracing each other backstage when they were on better terms.

There is more Kanye content in the drop including a video of Drake talking about his relationship with Yeezy following his aforementioned OVO Fest performance: “Yo, that was crazy! That’s real rap shit. We don’t communicate with each other enough and sometimes when we get on that stage, it’s an outpouring of emotion.
“I didn’t talk to Kanye before he got on stage, so that was us dapping it up for the first time. He sat in the car the whole time. I feel like it’s just things we’ve been waiting to say for a minute because it’s like, I’m the biggest Ye fan. Period. 
“Sometimes I feel like I can’t like it because I gotta go against it. But that shit tonight was almost therapeutic.”

Drake also released a fascinating clip of him putting together the tracklist for Nothing Was the Same, revealing that he was at one point considering including “Jodeci Freestyle” featuring J. Cole and a collaboration with Beyoncé called “Yours + Mine” (which eventually appeared on Bey’s self-titled album under the name “Mine”).
There’s also an amusing video of Drizzy doing his best impression of Migos‘ ad-libs during a rehearsal for their Aubrey & The Three Migos Tour.

The Toronto native has released endless amounts of content since his hotly-contested battle with Kendrick Lamar cooled off earlier this summer.
