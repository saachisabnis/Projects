Grande is now tied with Beyoncé for the eighth-most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s among solo women. The record is held by Mariah Carey, with 19 songs.
Grande wrote and produced "Yes, And?" with Swedish songwriter and record producers Max Martin and ILYA, with the latest single earning Martin the most No. 1s among producers ever on the chart — a record-breaking 24. Martin also ties with John Lennon for the second-most Hot 100 No. 1s among writers, with another Beatles bandmate, Paul McCartney, still holding the record.
