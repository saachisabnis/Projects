Sabrina Carpenter’s A Nonsense Christmas debuts tomorrow night. We talked to Yahoo Entertainment reporter Suzy Byrne about the “nonsense” event.
Suzy: A combination of sugar and spice! The pop queen is taking the classic holiday variety special (think: musical performances and comedy sketches) and putting her own contemporary, salty, sultry and stylish spin on it.
Suzy: I can’t wait for the “Espresso” singer’s duets with fellow pop powerhouse Chappell Roan and country music legend Shania Twain. She’ll be belting out classic covers and holiday songs from her EP Fruitcake from festive, bright sets.
Suzy: Cara Delevingne and Quinta Brunson visit Carpenter for a “Ghost of Christmas Present” bit, and Santa makes a cameo — thanks to Sean Astin. Sprinkle in Carpenter in a Sexy Santa ensemble, lots of fake snow and a little debauchery, and it should be a holly, jolly good time.
