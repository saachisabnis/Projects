9th February 2024Words: Daisy Carter 
Gen Z pop sensation Conan Gray has today dropped ‘Lonely Dancers’, the ’80s-drenched lead single from his forthcoming LP ‘FOUND HEAVEN’, which is slated for release on 5th April via Island Records. 
If the new track is anything to go by, the album - produced by the trio of Max Martin (The Weeknd, Adele, Ariana Grande), Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beck, Sia, Pink), and Shawn Everett (Kacey Musgraves, The Killers) - promises to be a maximalist, synth-driven affair, and will also feature the previously released cuts ‘Killing Me’, ‘Winner’, and ‘Never Ending Song’. 
‘FOUND HEAVEN’ is set to be Conan’s third full-length project, following 2020’s ‘Kid Krow’ and 2022’s ‘Superache’. The full tracklist hasn’t yet been revealed so watch this space - in the meantime you can check out the official video for ‘Lonely Dancers’ below.

 In Deep
Throwing it back to the sounds of the ​‘80s, Conan Gray’s third album is a musically exuberant curveball for the Gen Z icon. Emotive yet excitable, it’s a huge stride into a new lane all of his own.
