The results from this year’s Top 100 DJs poll were announced tonight (19th October)
Anyma is the Highest New Entry in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs 2024.
In last year’s Top 100 DJs issue, R3HAB revealed that his favourite DJ set of the year came courtesy of Anyma. Mariano Bo tapped the same artist as the year’s rising star; 22Bullets named him his hero of 2023; Le Twins selected his exhilarating ‘Eternity’ as their most cherished tune of the year. So, it’s no surprise that Anyma pops up as 2024’s highest new entry. It’s also no surprise that he’s so popular among his peers — Anyma is, of course, the solo pseudonym of Matteo Milleri of the long-time powerhouse duo Tale Of Us.
Having a great contact list doesn’t ensure success, but Milleri seems to be one of those relentless workaholic types that put the rest of us slackers to shame. He’s got his hand in fashion and visuals — he served as the creative visual director for The Weeknd’s one-night-only concert in São Paulo, for instance. But focusing on the musical front, the Afterlife label co-founder celebrated the release of his ‘Genesys II’ LP, while also working with the rarefied likes of FKA twigs, Sevdaliza and Grimes, and prepping for that run of shows at the Sphere in Vegas that you may have heard about — “while staying dedicated to my training and staying healthy”, he adds. Phew!
