Drake has surprisingly offered fans a preview of an unreleased Kendrick Lamar collaboration as part of his latest 100 Gigs content drop.
The video shows Drizzy listening to a beat in the studio alongside longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib, with the Toronto native calling the bouncy instrumental “crazy.”

After the track finishes playing, he hypes up an unnamed guest feature, saying: “For him, where he’s at, I know he’s gonna murder that shit.”
Shebib then revels that Drake was referring to his future foe, remarking: “When he told me Kendrick, it just made so much sense. Oh, the brilliance! So good.”

The beat being played in the clip was later used by Action Bronson for his 2015 song “Actin’ Crazy,” which was produced by 40 and Dreamville’s Omen.
While the video is undated, there’s a good chance it stems from around 2012 or 2013 as much of the latest 100 Gigs footage documents the making of Nothing Was the Same.

It was in late 2013 that Drake and Kendrick’s relationship would sour after the Compton rapper called out Drake by name in his fiery verse on Big Sean’s “Control,” while also seemingly taking shots at him in his BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher.
Prior to that, the pair worked together on three songs including “Buried Alive Interlude,” “Poetic Justice” and A$AP Rocky‘s “Fuckin’ Problems.”

It’s unclear if K. Dot ended up recording vocals to the beat in the video.
Drake’s most recent 100 Gigs drop appears to be concentrated on his various enemies. As well as Kendrick, it includes old videos featuring Kanye West and The Weeknd.

There’s also a video of Drake talking about his relationship with Yeezy following the festival: “Yo, that was crazy! That’s real rap shit. We don’t communicate with each other enough and sometimes when we get on that stage, it’s an outpouring of emotion.
“I didn’t talk to Kanye before he got on stage, so that was us dapping it up for the first time. He sat in the car the whole time. I feel like it’s just things we’ve been waiting to say for a minute because it’s like, I’m the biggest Ye fan. Period.
