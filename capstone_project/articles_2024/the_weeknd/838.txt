Selena Gomez’s new boyfriend, Benny Blanco, was roasted for removing his shoes and exposing his bare tootsies while sitting courtside at the Los Angeles Lakers game.
The music producer, 35, was photographed kicking off his white Birkenstock clogs while cozying up to Gomez as they watched the Lakers play the Miami Heat at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
Social media users were left aghast at Blanco’s audacity as he wriggled his sockless stompers for all to see. 
“Toes out for a dude court side should be a lifetime ban,” one person commented on an Instagram photo of Blanco’s NBA date night with Gomez.
“Put dem hobbit feet back in dem shoes boy. Lifetime ban him lmao,” a second person agreed.
“Having your dogs out on the sideline is wild behavior,” a third chimed in, with another calling it “crazy.” 
“Literally cus wtf are u doing with ur man feet out next to selena gomez,” another fan asked. 
“not w the dawgs out bro omg,” a troll said. 
“His jacket and his bare feet out in public both give me the ick,” someone savagely jabbed, referring to his pink and orange floral coat.
Another unapologetically wrote, “Toes out next to the Dasani tells me plenty. This is unacceptable behavior.” 
“Put those cheese grabbers away man 🧀,” a hater pleaded. 
“can’t with this hairy barefooted man,” another admitted. 
Others called having his toes out on the hardwood floor an “abomination” and “diabolical work.”
“Naw, keep them fuggin shoes On at the game,” one more begged. 
The “Only Murders in the Building” actress, 31, appeared unbothered by Blanco’s little piggies and was spotted snuggling up to her new beau throughout the game.

Gomez and Blanco have been dating for nearly seven months, though she didn’t confirm their love until mid-December 2023. 
Since taking their relationship public, the duo have gone on several date nights including a fun night out in New York City and an art exhibit adventure in Los Angeles last month.
“He’s still better than anyone I’ve ever been with. Facts,” Gomez admitted in an Instagram comment this past December. “He has treated me better than any human being on this planet.”
The former Disney star previously dated Blanco’s close pal Justin Bieber as well as The Weeknd, Drew Taggart, Charlie Puth, Zedd, Niall Horan, and other A-listers.
