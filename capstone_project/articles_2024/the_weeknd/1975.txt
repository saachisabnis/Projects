As Taylor Swift basks in the success of her latest album, at least one person is not a fan.
Drake took aim at his fellow Grammy winner, 34, and her fans in a Kendrick Lamar diss track response titled 'Push Ups', which he released on Friday, hours after Swift dropped The Tortured Poets Department.
'Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split / The way you doin' splits, b**ch, your pants might rip / You better do that motherf***in' show inside the bity,' Drake raps.
He continues, 'Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties.'
Lamar, 36, previously appeared on a remixed version of Swift's 2014 track 'Bad Blood' shortly after his feud with Drake began.

Drake, 37, also took aim at Lamar's small feet in the track's promo art, which featured only a size 7 shoe tag.
'Drake doing nasty work with the cover art dawg,' wrote one fan on Twitter.
'You know, at the very least Drake is consistently corny,' another reasoned. 'Making the album art off of a shoe size diss is top tier cringe.' 
The Degrassi alum went on to namedrop SZA, Travis Scott and 21 Savage in the song.
'Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em fifty / Pipsqueak, pipe down / You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down / Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down.'
'Push Ups' has earned mixed reviews on social media, with some praising Drake and others poking fun at him.
'Lolololol. Funny how the same guy who made "Hotline Bling" ended up dropping the hardest diss since Eminem's "Killshot",' one person wrote.
'Kendrick has been begging for someone to really try him for years,' wrote another. 'Drake just did with "Push Ups". Now we get to see what Kendrick has in the chamber it's a great time to be a hip hop fan.'
'Kendrick officially has a month to respond,' another fan posted. 'The time it took Drake to actually put this out.'
After releasing his own Drake diss track 'Champagne Moments' last weekend, Rick Ross shared a clip to his Instagram Story of his car speakers playing 'Push Ups'.
The next clip featured him listening to 'Champagne Moments', which accuses Drake of getting a nose job and a Brazilian butt lift.
Drake's new song was previously leaked on social media last week, as fans speculated whether the track was made with artificial intelligence.
'Push Ups' takes aim at Lamar, J Cole and The Weeknd, who all previously slammed Drake in guest verses on Future and Metro Boomin's album We Don't Trust You last month.
Drake followed up 'Push Ups' with a new freestyle shared Friday night on Instagram. 'Taylor Made Freestyle. While we wait on you I guess,' he captioned the post.

Drake's diss tracks came hours after Swift dropped her 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department
'The first one really only took me an hour or two / Next one is really about to bring out the coward in you,' Drake raps. 
'But now we gotta wait a f---ing week because Taylor Swift is your new top,' he continues.
Later in the track, Drake adds, 'Shout out to Taylor Swift, biggest gangster in the music game right now. You know, I move my album when she drop, I said that already.'
Drake's 'Push Ups' and Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department are now available for streaming.
