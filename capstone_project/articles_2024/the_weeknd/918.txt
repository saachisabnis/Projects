It’s officially up. Drake has responded to shots fired at him from all angles with the new diss track “Push Ups.” The single heavily targets Kendrick Lamar following the “Like That” diss verse but also takes aim at Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, Future, Rick Ross, and one that nobody saw coming, Ja Morant.
Throughout “Push Ups,” Drake shades Kendrick Lamar over his size and being an “extortion baby” losing 50% of his income to Top Dawg Entertainment. Additionally, Drake calls out being forced to drop verses for Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, and more.
Drake also addresses bars specifically from “Like That”:
“You won’t ever take no chain off of usHow the fuck you big steppin’ with a size seven men’s on?”
and
“Just to have this talk with yo’ ass, I had to hike downBig difference between Mike then and Mike nowWhat the fuck is this, a twenty-V-one, nigga?What’s a prince to a king? He a son, nigga”
From there, Drake turned his attention to The Weeknd:
“Y’all nigga manager was Chubbs lil’ blunt runnerClaim the 6ix, and you boys ain’t even come from itAnd when you boys got rich, you had to run from itCash blowin’ Abel bread, out here trickin’ (Out here trickin’)Shit we do for bitches he doin’ for niggas”
He swiftly had a bar for Metro: “Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, nigga”
He even got back into the “Officer Ricky” association to RIck Ross, while jabbing Ja Morant:
“Niggas really got me out here talkin’ like I’m 50, ayyNiggas really got me out here rappin’ what I’m livin’I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I’m RickyCan’t believe he jumpin’ in, this nigga turnin’ fiftyEvery song that made it on the chart, he got from DrizzySpend that lil’ check you got and stay up out my businessWorry ’bout whatever goin’ on with you and (Uh)Ayy, shoutout to the hooper that be bustin’ out the griddyWe know why you mad, nigga, I ain’t even trippin’All that lil’ heartbroken Twitter shit for bitches”
