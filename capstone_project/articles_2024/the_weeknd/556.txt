Kendrick Lamar has swiftly reacted to Drake‘s recent livestream in which he took shots at several enemies — including himself.
The 6 God appeared on Canadian streamer xQc’s Kick channel this past weekend where he began by jabbing his fierce rival Kendrick while introducing himself to viewers.

“I’m here — mind, body and soul fully intact, in case you were wondering. You need facts to take me out; fairytales won’t do it,” he said.
The defiant statement was a clear reference to claims in Kendrick’s various diss tracks about Drake behaving inappropriately with young girls, keeping the company of sexual predators and fathering a secret daughter.

The OVO Sound hitmaker also dissed Steve Lacy by calling him a “fragile” opp and told xQc to turn off The Weeknd‘s music when he began to play the singer’s 2016 hit “Starboy.”
Kendrick reacted to the flagrant stream in a text exchange with his friend Reli, who posted screenshots of the conversation on his Instagram Stories.

In the messages, Reli says to Kendrick: “You done turned blood into a streamer on Phillies [laughing face emojis],” to which the rapper replies with several laughing face emojis of his own.
Reli then says: “That’s a damn shame,” prompting Kendrick to ask: “He trippin??!”
Reli replies: “Blood don’t won’t [sic] no smoke Philly gang,” before censoring his next message.
This latest (albeit light) flare-up between Kendrick Lamar and Drake comes shortly after the arrival of the former’s new album GNX.
Released by surprise last Friday (November 22), the 12-track project finds Kendrick aiming some pointed remarks at his Canadian counterpart, albeit in more subliminal fashion than he did on his flurry of diss songs from earlier this year.

On the opening song “wacced out murals,” Kendrick raps: “N-ggas from my city couldn’t entertain old boy / Promisin’ bank transactions and even bitcoin / I never peaced it up, that shit don’t sit well with me / Before I take a truce, I’ll take ’em to Hell with me.”
He also references Drizzy’s controversial diss song “Taylor Made Freestyle” and Snoop Dogg‘s apparent support of it: “Snoop posted ‘Taylor Made,’ I prayed it was the edibles / I couldn’t believe it, it was only right for me to let it go.”

Tha Doggfather responded to the line soon after by joking on X (formerly Twitter): “K dot new album GNX [explosion emoji] [fire emojis] It was the edibles [facepalm emoji] [grinning face emoji] [fist bump emoji] west west king.”
