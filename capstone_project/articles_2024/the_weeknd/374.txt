	Is a new era in store for Justin Timberlake? According to fans of the former boy bander, signs are pointing to “yes.”

	On Monday (Jan. 8), fans noticed that all the posts on the “SexyBack” singer’s Instagram account were wiped clean. The only thing that remained was a profile photo of Timberlake, which featured his eyes sending a piercing look to a car’s rearview mirror. The singer’s bio is also blank, though his posts on Threads remain intact as of press time.

	Fans over on X, formerly known as Twitter, concluded that the removal of Timberlake’s Instagram posts — a promo technique used by fellow pop stars like Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, The Weeknd and more ahead of album releases or large projects — means that a new album is likely on the way.

	“Spread the word everyone. Justin Timberlake is coming!! #JT6isComing #NewEra,” a fan tweeted. “So the next time when Justin Timberlake is changing his profile pic we get the lead single omg I am crying and screaming,” another fan speculated, while a third fan wrote that Timberlake is “watching social media with his imminent return with new music.”

	










	Should Timberlake release an album, it would mark his sixth album and first since 2018’s Man of the Woods. The album marked his fourth consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200, where it charted for a total of 19 weeks. Just days after the album’s Feb. 2 release, he performed at the Super Bowl LII halftime show in Minneapolis.
