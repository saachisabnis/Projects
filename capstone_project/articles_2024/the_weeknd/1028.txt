Camila Cabello undoubtedly took over night one of the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival presented by Capital One, kicking off her set with catchy 2024 hit, "I Luv It."
The iconic songstress continued to turn up the heat as the show proceeded, unleashing 2019's "Shameless" and "Se√±orita," followed by a few tracks featured on her latest album, X. C,XOXO (released in June), including "Chanel No.5," "Dade County Dreaming," and "June Gloom." In addition to her latest masterpieces, Cabello opened the vault to bring back 2018's "Havana" and "Never Be The Same."
The super star served up the perfect amount of sass and spice as she spun across the stage in a stunning leather fit complete with a matching skirt and tall, furry boots. Cabello communicated with the crowd as if they were old friends, getting up close and personal with the audience, allowing them to scream into the microphone and chat with her between songs. 
The "My Oh My" songstress even shared the name of a fan whom she had an impactful interaction with on the red carpet before the show. The fan (Juan) mentioned he'd come all the way from Chicago to see Cabello play, reminding the artist of how blessed she is to have such dedicated fans stick with her throughout the entirety of her career. 
If you missed any of the action this weekend, or just want to re-live it all, an iHeartRadio Music Festival special including highlights from the event will be available to stream on Hulu on October 7th.
