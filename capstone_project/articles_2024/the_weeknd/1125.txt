The poster for the event revealed that viewers will have the chance to win $250,000 in cash, luxury cars, a dream vacation, one year’s rent and free tickets and travel to Drake’s upcoming tour in Australia, among other goodies.
To be in with a chance of winning, fans have to email in and explain “why you deserve whichever of these things you think you need most.”

A Christmas-themed trailer accompanying the announcement finds the 6 God talking about how much he enjoys being charitable, saying: “People often ask me what was the best day of my life […] my answer is the same every time: the two days I shot [the video for] ‘God’s Plan.’
“The joy that I experienced on those days, making other people happy, changing their week or their month or their year was an irreplaceable feeling. And that’s why Stake, along with me and Adin Ross, are doing the biggest streaming giveaway of all time.”

He adds: “I truly can’t wait to enjoy this moment together. Happy holidays to you all.”
The stream will begin on Thursday (December 26) at 8 p.m. EST via Drake’s Kick channel.
Drake previously used Canadian streamer xQc’s Kick channel to make his first public comments since his feud with Kendrick Lamar erupted.
Despite being widely deemed to have lost the battle, the Toronto native took a jab at his fierce rival by defiantly saying: “I’m here — mind, body and soul fully intact, in case you were wondering. You need facts to take me out; fairytales won’t do it.”

He was referencing Kendrick’s various allegations across his diss songs, including that Drake is a pedophile, associates with other sex offenders and secretly fathered a daughter.
While he did not make further mention of K.Dot during the stream, Drizzy did take time to throw shade at fellow friend-turned-foe The Weeknd.

After xQc began playing the singer’s 2016 hit “Starboy,” Drake said: “You’ve gotta switch this song, though. You have to switch this one. We’re the real Sixers, the real 6ix side. We don’t listen to that.”
