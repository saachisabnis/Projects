The Weeknd‘s psychological thriller Hurry Up Tomorrow has landed a distribution deal that will put the film into theaters worldwide.
According to a press release circulated on Monday (November 4), Lionsgate has secured the rights to the movie, which serves as an extension of the Toronto crooner’s forthcoming album of the same name. This will mark Abel’s feature film debut, and he will also handle the score alongside Daniel Lopatin. Jenny Ortega and Barry Keoghan also star in the new movie.

In a statement, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said: “Abel is a visionary whose art cannot be confined by any single medium. With Hurry Up Tomorrow, in partnership with [director] Trey [Edward Shults], his musical universe expands onto the big screen with a psychological thriller that will usher in a new cinematic experience for fans. We are thrilled to be bringing it to audiences worldwide.”
The album Hurry Up Tomorrow will serve as the third and final installment in a trilogy that includes The Weeknd’s previous albums, 2020’s After Hours and 2022’s Dawn FM.

“Yesterday was 14 years ago… We held our breath, falling into a shimmering sea in the after hours of the night… Attempted to cleanse the wounds with melodies and lights, a bulletproof bandage to shield what lies beneath,” he said when announcing the effort.
“In a place where the seasons never changed, where time ceased to exist. But therein lies the problem. Today has felt like an endless spin. I keep distorting the truth, immune to the dizziness, numb to the nausea. What lies beneath — screams in silence.”

The statement continues: “I look in the mirror and feel both old and new, stuck in limbo and unable to move. I still haven’t faced myself. More songs could help, but what do I have left to say? Woes is me in my gilded cage, right?
“The very thing that once made me invincible failed me on the world stage. A new trauma surfaced, opening floodgates. A new path awaits. When today ends, I’ll discover who I am.”

The Weeknd previously hinted at retiring his stage name after the release of what fans now know is titled Hurry Up Tomorrow, telling W magazine: “I’m going through a cathartic path right now. It’s getting to a place and a time where I’m getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter.
“I’ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I’m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.”

He added: “The album I’m working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd. This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I’ve said everything I can say.”
