Future has further fueled rumors that he has beef with Drake after releasing an original version of one of the 6 God’s songs on his new album with Metro Boomin.
We Still Don’t Trust You — the follow-up to last month’s We Don’t Trust You — arrived on Friday (April 12) and includes a track called “This Sunday,” which features the same hook as Drake’s “Feel No Ways.”

Future is credited as a co-writer on the Views cut, although it’s unclear if it originally belonged to the Atlanta rapper or he simply created it as a reference track for his What a Time To Be Alive collaborator.
“This Sunday” previously leaked in 2015, a year before Views came out. However, its official release almost a decade later has led to fans thinking it is further proof there are issues between Future and Drake.
One fan wrote on X: “Future put This Sunday on the album just to show n-ggas where Drake got that part on Feel No Ways from.”
Another said: “That’s not even right bro it’s nooooooo reasonnnnn Future singing the ‘Feel No Ways’ hook just WASHED Drake’s version and n-gga do you know how much I love ‘Feel No Ways’ by Drake????”

A third user added: “So Future on ‘this Sunday’ is the original 2015 reference track for Drake’s ‘feel no ways’ ?? Some nasty work dropping that on here.”
Drake and Future have collaborated extensively in the past, but their relationship seems to have soured in recent months as Pluto appeared to take shots at the Canadian rap star on We Don’t Trust You.

“You a n-gga No. 1 fan, dog/ Sneak dissin’, I don’t understand, dog/ Pillow talkin’, actin’ like a fed, dog/ I don’t need another fake friend, dog/ Can’t be ’bout a ho, ’cause we sharin’, dog/ In yo feelings, n-gga, why you playin’, dog?” he rapped on the album’s title track.
Metro Boomin later denied the two had fallen out over a woman, tweeting: “Yall n-ggas stop making stuff up for engagement and enjoy the music.”

Despite the denial, Drizzy seemingly hit out at both Future and Metro on Instagram last month, writing: “I could never sell ya’ll out to sell my latest work. Never do you bad out the blue but I’m down to make it worse.”
Things have only escalated since then, with A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd also taking shots at the 6 God on We Still Don’t Trust You.

The album even features an unexpected guest verse from J. Cole, who many had viewed as Drizzy’s most powerful ally.
While his number of apparent enemies continues to grow, there is talk Drake is readying a “nuclear” diss track — aimed mainly at Kendrick Lamar, whose blistering verse on Future and Metro’s “Like That” ignited this Hip Hop “civil war.”
