The Weeknd is headed to Sao Paulo, Brazil for one-night-only — and you’re invited to join him!
Abel will head to South America next month for a concert at Estadio MorumBIS. And don’t worry about a passport, plane tickets or taking time off work — the whole world will be able to watch the performance via livestream on YouTube. He also gave a hint of what to expect from the setlist, teasing his greatest hits alongside “a glimpse into what’s next for the artist.”
In a statement, he said, “I’m so excited to announce that we’ll be live streaming my show from São Paulo, Brazil, so everyone around the world can be a part of this special night… I wish I could come to every city and town on earth, but moments like this give us the chance to connect in real-time at least and share that energy together, no matter where you are."
