A security guard was shot multiple times early Monday morning (April 29) outside the Encino, California, home of music executive Amir Esmailian, co-founder of XO Records. The guard, a man in his mid to late 30s, was near a guard shack on a private road outside the property when he was hit. He was rushed to the hospital and underwent surgery. His condition is not yet known.
The shooting occurred around 2:45 a.m. on Jayden Lane near Encino Avenue, according to officer A. Delatorre of the Los Angeles Police Department. The assailants, described as three males wearing hoodies and surgical masks, fled the scene on foot after the shooting, per the Los Angeles Daily News. 
The home, currently listed for sale for nearly $12 million, is believed to be owned by Esmailian, an Iranian-Canadian music industry executive known for co-managing music artist The Weeknd, ABC 7 reports. 
Investigators are considering the possibility of an attempted home invasion as a motive for the attack. At least four people were inside the mansion at the time of the shooting, but it is unclear whether Esmailian was among them.
The investigation is ongoing, and further details about the incident are yet to be released.
