The Weeknd announced that the release date for his upcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, is set for Friday, January 24. Abel Tesfaye took to Instagram to also reveal his plans for a massive one-night-only record release concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the following day on January 25. This will mark the Weeknd’s debut live performance of his new work, with the special show featuring a custom built stage that will cover the entire floor of the huge outdoor stadium. 
Hurry Up Tomorrow will mark the final installment of the Weeknd’s album trilogy which began with 2020’s After Hours and continued with 2022’s Dawn FM. The first two singles from Hurry Up Tomorrow have previously been released, “Dancing In Flames” and “Sao Paolo,” which features a collaboration with Brazilian pop-star Anitta. A companion feature film also called Hurry Up Tomorrow is in the works, starring Tesfaye, Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan, and directed by Trey Edward Shults. (Variety)
