In a tumultuous week for Drake, a drive-by shooting happened outside his Toronto home on Tuesday (May 7), which left a security guard seriously injured and hospitalized with the need for emergency surgery.
Just a day after the shooting, a man was stopped as he attempted to make his way into the rapper’s swanky Bridle Path property that is commonly known as “The Embassy.”

Law enforcement were alerted after the 6 God’s security team stopped the person from entering through the front gate, following which he got into a brief altercation with those who stopped him. The trespasser apparently claimed that he was “here to see Drake.”
The Toronto Police Department later said: “Officers were called after a person attempted to gain access to the property. The person was apprehended under the mental health act.”
