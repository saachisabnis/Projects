Rick Ross‘ custom private jet is arguably his favorite material flex, and he has now used it to once again stoke his rivalry with former collaborator Drake.
On Friday (May 3), photographs of Rozay’s Gulfstream G550 plane roughed up in a grassy field began circulating online. Reports began coming in that the aircraft made a crash landing in Dallas but thankfully left nobody injured.

Soon after, the 48-year-old himself corroborated this, while using the situation as an excuse to provoke the Canadian rapper as he wrote: “My jet just crashed ; Drake OvO F16 fighter jet just shot us down.”
This came soon after Drizzy liked an Instagram post by Toronto media outlet Keep6ixsolid about the incident that was captioned: “The retired Miami government employee and current Cosplayer walked away unharmed because the wing stopped the plane.”

When Akademiks shared a screenshot of the Florida native’s story that read “DRAKE FIGHTER JET SHOT US DOWN,” Rozay took to its comments section and wrote: “I saw Whiteboy in the cockpit just like Tom Cruise in Top Gun”

Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar dropped “Like That” in late March, which features the Los Angeles MC devoting his entire guest verse to taking shots at Drake and J. Cole. The beef has since escalated a great deal, with Ross, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky joining K.Dot’s side and Cole withdrawing from the beef altogether after releasing a diss track of his own.
The Bawse even released a diss track of his own aimed at the Toronto native. Released in response to the 6 God’s “Push Ups” joint, “Champagne Moments” features the Teflon Don hitmaker accusing his rival of undergoing cosmetic surgery on his nose to appear more “white.”

“You ain’t never want to be a n-gga anyway, n-gga. That’s why you had an operation to make your nose smaller than your father nose, n-gga,” he says in the song’s outro.
Additionally, he also explains why the former collaborators fell out in the first place: “I unfollowed you, n-gga, ’cause you sent the mutahfuckin’ cease-and-desist to French Montana, n-gga. You sent the police, n-gga, hatin’ on my dog project.”

Shortly after Kendrick’s “euphoria” diss track took the Hip Hop community by surprise earlier this week, Rozay shared a clip on his Instagram Stories and addressed the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker with some condescending advice.
“White boy, white boy, white boy; crodie, crodie, crodie [Toronto slag for ‘brodie’],” he began, before poking fun at his adversary’s private jet. “Do they even have WiFi on that cargo plane? He may not even heard this yet, but look, white boy, I know we not friends but let me give you this advice ’cause you ain’t got nobody ’round you or you ain’t got no real n-ggas ’round you, let me just put it like that.”

Referring to the scathing cut’s opening section to once again poke fun at the Canadian superstar’s mixed-race background, he continued: “Stop. Don’t respond, don’t respond. You ain’t even peep when the intro came on with the Teddy Pendergrass [sample] — that was that Black vibe. Don’t do it.”
He continued, with a nod to rumors that Drake had been using Lil Yachty as a ghostwriter: “Don’t go write an eight-minute verse that— I know n-gga [Lil] Yachty, you want to get that money. You ain’t wrong, n-gga, keep buying them big houses, but I’ma tell you this like a real n-gga: ain’t no more BBLs, ain’t no more ass fillers, ain’t no more cheek fillers.”
