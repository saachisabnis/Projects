Drake‘s “Push Ups” diss song aimed at Kendrick Lamar, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross and more has been reworked into a Motown cut and has been circulating online, and Questlove is having a field day with it.
Earlier this week, the remix began making the rounds across social platforms. While it remains unclear where the joint came from or how it was made, it has been getting tons of attention for its comedic value.

On Friday (April 26), the Roots drummer took to Instagram and reshared a screen recording of a Twitter post by Rap Marathon that singles out how much funnier the following line sounds after the makeover: “Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n-gga.”
“Dog [five star emojis],” he wrote in the caption. “The only dog I got in this game is the mofo who enabled that pregnant pause on ‘make some drums n^*^%’————like they way he leaned into ‘druuuuuuuums…….’ man, even my self esteem went down.

“This one song made me miss every uncle I ever had in my life……like that voice you hear (70s babies) through clinched teeth like.”
He continued: “‘If you don’t GIIIIIT!!!……..’ like you know you already gonna get that benny hill smack in the back of your head walking on your way to the pre whuppin b4 he tell you pops what you and Big Mark & Weeski did to Miss Janie’s back window throwin that pink rubberball like a baseball.

“Just that ONE LINE is killing me.”
He concluded: “‘….shut cho hoe a^^ up……….(these are the seconds that makes this hilarious)……only to be followed up with the most demoralizing like——-‘I know Ms Mccrae done raised you better than that boy, stop lightin them smoke bombs on that abandon car yall know that’s the sun who didn’t make it back from Vietnam……”

“@champagnepapi even you gotta love this jawn. (For the record I’d rather see yall collabing but I’m out this game).”
Drake has been in the hot seat over the past few weeks as a number of his A-list peers have taken shots at him. In mid-April, Drizzy’s response “Push Ups” first hit the internet. It addresses a number of the superstar’s ongoing beefs.
This includes attacks on K.Dot in particular, who kickstarted the drama with his verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” last month.

“You better do that motherfuckin’ show inside the bitty/ Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/ Then we need a verse for the Swifties,” the voice raps, referring to the Compton native’s previous crossovers into pop music.
About A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd recently joining the battle and throwing shade at the Canadian superstar, the song continues with a reference to Kendrick comparing himself to Prince and his adversary as Michael Jackson: “What the fuck is this, a twenty-V-one, n-gga?/ What’s a prince to a king? He a son, n-gga.”

Additionally, the song also takes shots at J. Cole (who recently withdrew from the war of words) and Rozay while suggesting that SZA deserves a spot in the Big 3 more than Kendrick.
