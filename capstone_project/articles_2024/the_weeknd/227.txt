Amid the ever-growing beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, SZA has revealed she wants no part of it. On Saturday (April 13), Drake sent social media into a tailspin after dropping off “Push Ups.” 
The track’s title is rumored to reference a video of Lamar working out that was shared on social media several months ago. However, one line, in particular, seemed to catch the former TDE singer’s attention: “You ain’t in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped down,” the Tornoto-bred rapper said.

The line directly responds to Lamar’s verse on “Like Dat,” where he says, “Motherf*ck the big three, n*gga, it’s just big me.” On the other hand, SZA didn’t take too kindly to the “Rich Baby Daddy” singer dragging her into the situation. The singer hopped on her Instagram Story and posted a meme of former Real Housewives Of Atlanta star Nene Leakes, in which she says, “Now what am I in it?”

“Push Ups” could be the headshot Drake needs to take out Kendrick Lamar. It’s unclear when Lamar will respond, but sources say he has something up his sleeve. That said, Drake didn’t stop just at Lamar. 
He also took shots at Rick Ross and The Weeknd. Not too long after that, Ross responded with “Champagne Moments,” rapping, “N***as leakin’ they records when we speakin’ directly/ If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me.”
