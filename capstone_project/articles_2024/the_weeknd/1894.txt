Zach Bryan has declined to submit his music for consideration for the 2025 Grammy Awards. Voting by Recording Academy members has just started for next year’s music awards ceremony, and Bryan’s name intentionally won’t be on any of the ballots. Sources have confirmed that, “Bryan decided not to submit this year, based on feeling that he does not feel comfortable with awards shows making music competitive.” Bryan joins fellow high profile artists and musicians who have previously opted out of Grammy consideration in the past like the Weeknd, Drake, Macklemore, and Frank Ocean. Bryan won his first and only Grammy in 2024 for his duet with Kacey Musgraves, “I Remember Everything,” which earned them the Best Country Duo/Group Performance Grammy Award. Bryan has previously been nominated four times altogether, with all those nods coming in the country field. (Variety)
