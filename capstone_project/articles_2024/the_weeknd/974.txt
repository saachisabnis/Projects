Recently, The Weeknd surprised fans with a mysterious teaser for new music he will drop soon. The trailer for "Unprepared Certainty" was released on Tuesday. It shows what appears to be an animated depiction of the vocalist in a church and a home. Abel has been alluding to ending his trilogy in a very cryptic way for quite some time by saying last month, "There Are Three Chapters To This Tale." He hasn't mentioned any release dates for the end of this trilogy or if he will continue to make music after the release. What do you think of the teaser?
