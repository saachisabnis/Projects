As everyone shares their top 5 most-streamed songs and artists of the year, some interesting stats have emerged. The Weeknd has been crowned the most streamed male artist on Spotify for 2024. Not R&B, not pop, most streamed male artist.
That is huge.
We have curated a list of songs from the Canadian superstar that will make you a fan. Yes, for the peanut gallery, we have added some “old Weeknd” to the list. XO’s Starboy is one of the artists that many people hold their early discography near and dear to their hearts while neglecting the new music. We are here to help you get why he is the most streamed male artist out right now (via Spotify).
“After Hours” might not be as hyped as some of his other hits, but it’s a vibe you need. The track has this smooth, dreamy feel with a darker edge. It’s about regret and trying to fix a broken relationship. The beat and The Weeknd’s vocals make it a perfect late-night jam, whether you’re driving or just chilling in your feels. If you’re into that melancholic vibe with a catchy hook, this one’s for you.
“Coming Down” is another underrated gem that blends smooth beats with deep emotions. The track talks about messy relationships, regret, and trying to figure out where things went wrong. It’s got a mellow vibe with some serious 80s influence, but still sounds modern. Abel’s voice on this one really hits, and the slow, haunting instrumental makes it perfect for those late nights when you’re just vibing.
“Secrets” is one of The Weeknd’s most complete tracks that doesn’t get enough love. It’s got this smooth, almost mysterious vibe, with Abel singing about toxic relationships and trying to keep things low-key. The production is slick, with a bit of an 80s influence, and the hook is so catchy it’ll have you singing along. The song’s got that balance of darkness and groove that makes it stand out in his discography.
“Belong to The World” is a serious mood. The beat is hypnotic, and The Weeknd’s voice flows through it like butter. The track touches on themes of love, power, and vulnerability. The XO artist’s lyrics tell the story of feeling torn between fame and the woman he loves. The track’s a little more experimental, with those heavy, atmospheric beats that make it stand out. If you want something a little more emotional and intense, this one’s for you.
“I Was Never There” is arguably one of The Weeknd’s most slept-on tracks. The vibe is so chill, yet it’s packed with emotion. The song deals with the feeling of being emotionally distant and disconnected, even though you’re physically there. It’s a perfect balance of haunting and beautiful, with Abel’s voice cutting deep into the theme of lost love and regret. This track should’ve been a bigger hit, but it’s still one of those secret treasures for real fans of his work.
