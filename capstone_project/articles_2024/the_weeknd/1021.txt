Metro Boomin has issued a response to Drake criticizing his skills as a producer.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (April 16), the Heroes & Villains hitmaker posted a link to a YouTube tutorial he made called “start with your drums first sometimes.”

The video, which was originally uploaded in December, months before his feud with Drizzy ignited, shows him talking about his production process and the importance of drums in rap beats.
Metro also subtly threw shade at the 6 God by liking a tweet which said: “Drake calling Rick Ross racist is exactly what a white person would say in response.”
Drake has been taking shots at Metro Boomin ever since the release of his second joint album with Future, We Still Don’t Trust You, despite their previous working relationship.
On his leaked diss song “Push Ups (Drop & Give Me 50)” — which also included lyrical darts aimed at Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and The Weeknd, among others — the Toronto native rapped: “Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n-gga.”

He referenced that line days later by posting a deepfake of Metro’s head superimposed onto Nick Cannon’s character in the movie Drumline.
Doubling down on his social media taunts, Drake also hired a marching band to play drums outside of Magic City, the famed Atlanta strip club where Metro and Future promoted their aforementioned project.

Metro first began throwing shade at Drake late last year, long before the recent eruption of rap feuds.
The multi-platinum producer had expressed annoyance that Her Loss, Drizzy’s collaborative album with 21 Savage, kept winning awards over his own project Heroes & Villains, despite the latter racking up more streams (and Metro being a credited producer on Her Loss).

“Proof that award shows are just politics and not for me,” he wrote in a since-deleted post on X. ““Idc about awards honestly, the true award and REWARD is knowing that the music I spend so much time on brings joy to people’s everyday lives.”
Drake later unfollowed Metro Boomin on Instagram and appeared to hit back during a Stake livestream where he said: “To the rest of you — the non-believers, the underachievers, the tweet and deleters — you guys make me sick to my stomach, fam. Look at my eyes — you guys wanna do something? That’s what I thought.”
