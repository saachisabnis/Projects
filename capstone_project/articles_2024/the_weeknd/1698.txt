Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan are rumoured to have called time on their romance.
The pair have been romantically linked since December 2023 when they were spotted having dinner together in Los Angeles, and fans thought they were the perfect couple. But break-up rumours are now swirling, with reports suggesting that US singer Carpenter ended things with the Irish Saltburn actor.
Here is everything we know so far about the former couple's relationship, their rumoured split and what they have coming up.
Carpenter is the latest star to follow the likes of Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande along that well-trodden path from children’s TV to the charts. The niece of actor Nancy Cartwright (who provides the voice of Bart Simpson in The Simpsons), Carpenter made her screen debut at 12 in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and got her big break in 2014, when she was cast as Maya in Disney show Girl Meets World.
She continued to work on music at the same time and in 2015 unveiled her debut album Eyes Wide Open. But it was this year that she really found her feet as a pop star when she released the mega-hit, Espresso. Just weeks later Carpenter released Please Please Please, which topped the charts in both the US and the UK. The star has also been supporting Taylor Swift on her massive Eras tour.
Keoghan’s career got going about the same time as Carpenter’s, with the Irish actor getting his start in 2011 when he answered a casting notice for crime film Between The Canals. The part got him noticed, and Keoghan started to build his career with TV shows like Love/Hate and Chernobyl and movies including Eternals and The Batman.
The critics paid attention to his impressive performance in 2022 movie The Banshees of Inisherin, which earned him a Golden Globe nod and a Bafta. But it was last year's Saltburn - and THAT bathtub scene - that really put him on the map.
With her acting, singing and other ventures like a fragrance line and modelling work, Carpenter's bank balance is thought to be pretty healthy. Recent estimates put her net worth at somewhere in the region of £9m - not bad for someone who only recently turned 25.
Keoghan, 31, is also thought to be raking it in, with his net worth estimated at £2.5m. The actor has certainly come a long way from where he started, when he pocketed 120 Euros for his first film. He previously told Backstage he got the job in Between The Canals after seeing an ad in a local shop window.
"It said 'open audition'," he said. "I remember taking the number down and not allowing anyone to see me, because I was afraid I’d get stink. My friends might say, 'Oh, you’re into acting?'" He went on to get the part, explaining: "The movie was shooting on the same dates as school, so I thought, 'Oh, well, I’ll get off school'. Then I got paid 120 Euros. That’s 120 Euros to show up on a bike! I was like, 'I’m there'."
Carpenter and Keoghan - who has a toddler son from his former relationship with dental nurse Alyson Kierans - are thought to have met at Paris Fashion Week in 2023. It seems sparks flew, as a few weeks later they were spotted having what onlookers thought looked like a romantic dinner in California.
They played their cards close to their chests when it came to the budding relationship, with neither saying much about it as the rumour mill cranked into overdrive. However, they gave little hints, like the odd Instagram comment and the time Keoghan was snapped in a bracelet that spelled out "Sabrina". On another occasion, Carpenter was asked on a podcast if she'd seen Saltburn, and she replied coyly: "You know, I have."
By February, it seems they were ready to take a tentative step towards making things official when they went to an Oscar after-party together. The stars, both clad in black, were apart on the red carpet but were photographed together inside.
Then in March, Keoghan was spotted in the crowd at one of Swift's Eras concerts, where Carpenter was the support act.
A TikTok captured by someone in the crowd appeared to confirm they were an item, as it showed Carpenter backstage after she had performed, running towards the actor. He wrapped his arms around her before they walked off together looking very coupled up.
Not long afterwards Carpenter addressed relationships, although not Keoghan specifically, with Cosmopolitan. "The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love," she said. "So yeah, it’s fun and it’s messy. I think I’m still just at this place where I’m really enjoying the newness of all of it."
Keoghan was also sighted at Coachella, apparently attending to support Carpenter.
In May the pair both attended the Met Gala, one of the biggest nights in the showbiz calendar. They walked the red carpet separately, but were then snapped together on the famous Met steps, where Keoghan jokingly covered his face with his hat as they were photographed together.
In June, Keoghan had a starring role in the video for Carpenter's biggest track to date - Please, Please, Please. The steamy video saw the singer as a woman in a relationship with a criminal, played by the Saltburn star, and fans loved it.
Carpenter gave fans a little insight into her feelings for the actor when she told Variety that her beau "loved the song". "He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that,” she said. “I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation..”
In August, rumours that the pair had broken up started circulating. Although neither has confirmed anything, it was reported that Carpenter called time on their relationship.
Whatever their love lives hold in the future, it's fair to say that both Carpenter and Keoghan have plenty coming up workwise.
The singer is due to drop her eagerly awaited sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet, later this month. And in September she is heading out on the road for the North American leg of her tour, which arrives in Europe next year.
Keoghan will soon be seen in thriller Bring Them Down and is set to share the screen with The Weeknd and Jenna Ortega in a new film from director Trey Edward Shults, but few details are known about the project.
Yahoo has contacted representatives for Carpenter and Keoghan for comment.
