Nirvana's "Nevermind" still breaks records more than three decades after its debut. 
In a rare feat, it has become only the ninth album in history to spend 700 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1991, Nevermind skyrocketed up the charts and overtook Michael Jackson’s "Dangerous" to claim the top spot on the Billboard 200, solidifying its place in music history.
Today, the album sits at #120 on the chart, just passed Linkin Park’s "Hybrid Theory", continuing the success of *Nevermind* and its longevity. Nirvana's classic is currently outpacing albums from Drake and The Weeknd, proving its lasting influence. 
The other eight albums that have spent over 700 weeks on the Billboard 200 include:
- Bob Marley and The Wailers "Legend: The Best of Bob Marley and The Wailers" (865 weeks)
- Journey "Journey’s Greatest Hits" (835 weeks)
- Creedence Clearwater Revival "Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits" (724 weeks)
- Eminem "Curtain Call: The Hits" (714 weeks)
- Bruno Mars "Doo-Wops & Hooligans" (706 weeks)
