It appears Lady Gaga is going to make an appearance in Fortnite Festival, as the singer is teasing an upcoming collaboration with Epic Games. 
In a post on X/Twitter, Gaga posted an image of what appears to be her Fortnite character but is masked by a bright light and smoke. The bottom right corner of the screen reveals a Fortnite Festival-related announcement is coming on February 22.

The more interesting part of this is Lady Gaga made this teaser post by quoting a post she made on X/Twitter over four years ago when she asked her followers (and anyone who saw the post) what "fortnight" is, with the singer more familiar with the Fortnite franchise given her proper spelling of Fortnite in the most recent post. 
Lady Gaga is the latest musical artist to collaborate with Epic Games and the Fortnite property. Previous examples include the Travis Scott Astronomical event held in Fortnite nearly four years ago, which had the rapper performing a concert live inside Epic's widely popular free-to-play battle royale. More recently, The Weeknd debuted a new music video for his song "Popular" in the Fortnite Festival.
In our review of Fortnite Festival, which scored a 4 out of 10, my colleague Luke Reilly wrote: "Fortnite Festival's limited, isolating gameplay and overpriced tracks may turn Fortnite players into rhythm game fans, but it won't turn rhythm game fans into Fortnite players." 
Despite a rough start when it was released last December, including a lack of support for plastic instruments, Epic said that controller support is a "priority" for Fortnite Festival. Additionally, we exclusively revealed last month that PDP is teaming up with Epic to release a new wireless guitar that is compatible with Rock Band 4 (and eventually) Fortnite Festival.
