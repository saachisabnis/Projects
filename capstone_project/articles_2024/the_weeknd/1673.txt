Music legend Quincy Jones died earlier this month after a years-long battle with pancreatic cancer.

The 91-year-old, whose generation-spanning work shaped Michael Jackson’s solo career and included collaborations with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Diana Ross and the Weeknd, died Nov. 3 at his Bel-Air home. He was surrounded by his children, siblings and close family, his publicist, Arnold Robinson, said at the time. No cause of death was disclosed then.
