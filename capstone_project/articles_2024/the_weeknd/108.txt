NYC DJ Funkmaster Flex is dying to know what was the whole point of Kendrick Lamar and Drake’s so-called beef. Period. Gotham City’s most prolific DJ went on X (formerly Twitter) an opined with his thoughts. 
Flex had a theory, which isn’t wild by any stretch, that the feud might have been concocted for marketing, or maybe it was, in fact, a competitive duel. Here’s what he posted:
 “I HAVE DRAKE / KENDRICK QUESTION?,” he wrote. “WAS IT A LYRICAL COMPETITION? OR A MARKETING / CAREER RELAUNCH? I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE RULES IN A LYRICAL BATTLE?” 
Of course the chorus of Lamar’s fanbase flew into K Dot’s defense in the replies, like clockwork. Here’s what one user posted: 
“Drake lost regardless of what you call it lmaooo.. but what makes you say Career relaunch? Did he retire & i missed it?” Another added: “Bro acting like Kendrick career was dead or dying…it would make sense if this was Rick Ross.” Ross, as well as Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, and more artists, have also been feuding with Drake.
Another arguable GOAT recently gave his two cents. LL Cool J had this to say about the feud:
“He did his thing, he showed up and I think his fans can feel comfortable wit that. […] The key to that stuff is as a long as it doesn’t distract you from your ultimate goal, it’s a wonderful thing to participate in. I love it.”
What ya’ll think. Was this an authentic beef between two artists who genuinely didn’t like each other? A massive marketing campaign by both titans or maybe one of the two using the fight to rebrand and relaunch? Ya’ll be the judge.
