Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2024 Ceremony Reactions (Part 4)
Jay-Z’s speech was narcissistic and self-serving. He does not care about other black artists. And he and his wife will show up next year and the year after that. 
Honey, totally agree that Beyoncé and Jay-Z will continue to show up to the shitfest Grammys despite repeatedly losing Album of the Year.
 That was always a non-factor brought up by Beyoncé haters. If Grammys really didn’t like albums with lots of producers/writers, Falling Into You wouldn’t have won. “B-but Falling Into You sold 30 million copies!!!” Again, if they were REALLY bothered by lots of collaborators, they wouldn’t vote for it regardless, just like they didn’t go with “Invasion of Privacy”, “Scorpion”, “Damn”, Beyoncé’s albums, etc. See a pattern? It was never about that, that’s an excuse to save face, at best, hypocrisy at worst. Self Titled, Lemonade and Renaissance were all critically acclaimed records, so no one(besides Beyoncé’s haters) would be trashing the Grammys for awarding them, and no one cares about credits. That’s only discussed when Beyoncé is involved because there’s this thing in stan twitter/ATRL that she doesn’t write her songs, uses writing camps, etc. If Grammys really bought that narrative, she wouldn’t have won multiple songwriting awards including SOTY. Beyoncé, SZA, Kanye, Frank, The Weeknd, The Fugees, Eminem, etc, all lost AOTY when they had the best narrative/best album nominated because Grammy voters hate urban/hip-hop music. It’s very simple. 
Kendrick in 2018 might’ve had the greatest narrative of any artist of the past decade and NARAS was like “Too Black”
