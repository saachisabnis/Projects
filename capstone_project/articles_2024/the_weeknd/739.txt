The Black Crowes took the stage at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival presented by Capital One for the first time ever, and kicked off the Sin City show in true rock fashion. 
Dressed in black leather attire, the "Thorn in My Pride" stars made their debut at the epic annual event, bringing fans back to the 90s with legendary tracks spanning the entirety of their impressive 34-year (and counting) career.  
The icons kicked off night one of the festival with 1990's "Twice as Hard" and continued to shower the arena with nostalgia performing, "She Talks To Angels," "Jealous Again," "Hard to Handle" (written by blues icon Otis Redding), and of course, 1992's "Remedy." The hitmakers teleported the audience back to the present day with "Wanting and Waiting," featured on their latest album, Happiness Bastards, released earlier this year. 
The February release stood out as the band's first album in 15 years, and their tenth, full-length studio album. 
If you missed any of the action this weekend, or just want to re-live it all, an iHeartRadio Music Festival special including highlights from the event will be available to stream on Hulu on October 7th.
