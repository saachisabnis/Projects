Future has sent out a tweet in support of Gunna‘s new single, but then he promptly deleted it, and fans aren’t quite sure why.
The “Mask Off” rapper took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday (March 14) to tweet out support for “Prada Dem,” Gunna’s new single featuring Offset. It wasn’t long before the post was subsequently deleted.

This prompted one of the Future fan pages to write: “I was happy bc I thought Future was cool with Gunna. Then he deleted the tweet. [sad face emoji].”
Check out the two posts below:
On “Prada Dem,” which officially hit streaming services on Friday (March 15), the Atlanta rapper hits back at claims of him being a “rat,” and insists that he’s anything but.
Over wispy synths and hard-hitting trap drums, the “fukumean” rapper spits: “I set the trend, I’m a trendsetter/ I’m not a rat, still gettin’ cheddar.”

Gunna has been batting off snitching allegations ever since he took a plea deal in the RICO case against his and Young Thug’s YSL collective in December 2022.
The Drip or Down hitmaker entered into an Alford plea, meaning he pleaded guilty to a single racketeering conspiracy charge while maintaining his innocence on that same charge as a form of self-preservation.
He was also subsequently released from jail while Thugga, who is currently on trial, remained behind bars without bond.

Gunna and Future last worked together in 2022, when they collaborated alongside Roddy Rich on the official remix for “Too Easy.”
The video, which arrived in January of that year, finds Gunna cycling through several looks including newscaster, football star, fashionista and more.
At the same time, Future trades Atlanta drip for a kilt in Scotland, bikini carwash and playing Gunna’s co-anchor during a newscast.

For his efforts, Roddy throws a diamond ring in the air and watches it freeze everything around him as he plays the piano, always the center of attention.
That same year, Gunna, Future, and Young Thug made history when their single, “Pushin P,” became the first of that year to earn a gold certification from the RIAA.
