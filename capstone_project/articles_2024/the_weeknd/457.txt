Sagittarians are exceptionally fun and always up for a good laugh. They’re socially active, which makes sense: They’re usually the instantly beloved and welcome in any room they find themselves in. While they generally skew happy-go-lucky, they still have that temper that characterizes fire signs. Usually, this temper flares when they meet someone close-minded, mean or negative. They love getting lost in a new area of interest or a conversation. Sometimes, this makes them easily distracted, but their confidence usually masks their lack of clarity.
Air signs tend to get lofty — and none more so than Aquarius. This sign is interested in learning, and even more interested in using those intellectual pursuits to better their lives and their communities. This makes Aquarians forward-minded and empathetic at the same time. They can get carried away with their projects and ideas, though, forgetting to tend to their connections. They feel they have a purpose to fulfill and tend to get caught up in that ideal.
These independent signs complement, rather than camp each other. Their connection is marked by shared interests and open-mindedness. Sagittarius will get Aquarius out of the house for some adventures, and Aquarius will get Sagittarius out of their comfort zone by challenging them to hold new perspectives. They know how to embrace one another’s unique qualities.
A strong intellectual bond is formed when Sagittarius meets Aquarius. Both signs value freedom and innovation. Sagittarius will often bring surprises with a side of mischief, while Aquarius will be quirky and forward-thinking. These two will have lively conversations and will celebrate each other’s style. Challenges arise when Sagittarius asks for attention from Aquarius, who may be aloof.
Sagittarius and Aquarius keep friendship at the heart of their romance. Even if the connection is sudden, the commitment won't be. Their romance will unfurl gradually. Both signs value alone time, but will find that the other person is worth the socializing. Watch as these two signs make room for each other.
Marriage between Sagittarius and Aquarius is marked by autonomy and adventure. They maintain strong independent lives, and think of their relationship as the stable place waiting for them. Exploration makes their union harmonious and progressive. They will bring each other interesting stories from the field. Their marriage will help them grow together and individually.
Sagittarius and Aquarius bring the brains to work. Together, they create a dynamic and intellectually charged team. They love to work independently but can come together to innovate. Aquarius thinks of themselves as a problem solver, while Sagittarius is the cheerleader offering support.
