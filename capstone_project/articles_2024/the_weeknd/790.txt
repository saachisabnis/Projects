Kendrick Lamar‘s reaction to Drake‘s diss track “Family Matters” has been revealed by fellow Compton rapper Problem.
Sitting down for a chat with Bootleg Kev, Problem (who also goes by his government name Jason Martin) detailed Kendrick’s initial reaction to the 6 God’s explosive diss song.

“I’ma give you some real insight. You hearing this first,” Problem said. “[Drake] dropped ‘Family Matters’ and I text [Kendrick] like, ‘This ain’t it. Man, it’s time to step on his head.’ He was like, ‘Say less.’
“I’m thinking it ain’t nothing deep like that. I go to the bathroom. I come back. The muthafucking song [‘Meet the Grahams’] is uploaded! I said ‘Wait, wait, wait!'”

“I text him like, ‘N-gga, you already [dropped the song?!].’ He’s like, ‘I’ve been waiting for this n-gga to drop something,'” he continued. “[Drake] didn’t even know what he was going to get. Man, Drake shot a video and all this shit. Sometimes you just gotta know what to do and what not to do.
Problem also recalled watching Kendrick record an entire song in 20 minutes in the studio during a 2010 studio session: “I’ve been in the studio with all of the greatest people. I’ve never seen nothing like that, ever […] He’s the G.O.A.T.”
On “Family Matters,” Drake took numerous shots at Kendrick, as well as Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd.
His most vicious bars were reserved for the Compton kingpin, who he accused of assaulting his fiancée Whitney Alford while also claiming that one of K. Dot’s children belonged to his longtime manager Dave Free.

Within 20 minutes of the track being released, Kendrick fired back with “Meet the Grahams,” which contained equally salacious claims about Drake including that he preys on underage girls, was hiding a daughter and associates with sex offenders.
The Canadian rap star appears to have since moved on from the feud following the release of “The Heart Part 6,” which was widely criticized by fans and fellow Hip Hop figures alike.

Despite being deemed to have lost the battle, he attempted to assert his status as one of the greatest rappers of all time in a recent social media post.
Alongside pictures of him wearing baggy pants with a cardigan sweater draped over his shoulders while watching his son Adonis’ soccer game, Drake wrote: “Goats don’t worry about one trick ponies.”
