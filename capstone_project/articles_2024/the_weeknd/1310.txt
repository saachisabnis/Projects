KAYTRANADA’s rise to fame hit a high point in 2021 when he won two Grammy awards. This groundbreaking achievement marked him as the first Black and first openly gay artist to win Best Dance/Electronic Album for BUBBA. Following this success, KAYTRANADA channeled his creative energy into TIMELESS, a new album that showcases his unique style.
TIMELESS is a collection of dance tracks perfect for any club night. The album features various artists who bring their own flair to KAYTRANADA’s beats. PinkPantheress enhances the bouncy house track “Snap My Finger” with her sweet voice, while Ravyn Lenae brings a seductive vibe to the R&B track “Video.” Thundercat adds humor and smooth falsetto to the jazzy hip-hop track “Wasted Words.”
The energy peaks with “Do 2 Me,” featuring Anderson .Paak and SiR, and “Witchy,” featuring Childish Gambino. These tracks tell stories of late-night romance with KAYTRANADA’s sultry production. His signature sound from BUBBA evolves further in TIMELESS.
On “Drip Sweat,” Channel Tres’s deep voice blends with punchy drums and samples from Lyn Collins’ “Think (About It).” KAYTRANADA experiments with AI sampling on “Seemingly” and tries singing for the first time on the Weeknd-inspired “Stepped On.” This track features ’80s New Wave elements, adding a dark, moody atmosphere.
TIMELESS demonstrates KAYTRANADA’s growth as an artist. With each track, he pushes boundaries and explores new sounds, making this album a must-listen for fans of dance and electronic music. Also stream TIMELESS on Apple Music and Spotify.
