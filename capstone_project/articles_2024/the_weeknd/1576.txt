Pepsi’s 2017 “Live for Now” ad starring Kendall Jenner quickly became a prime example of how not to co-opt social movements for advertising purposes. The commercial showed Jenner abandoning a photoshoot to join a protest, where she eventually hands a can of Pepsi to a police officer, seemingly resolving the tension between the protestors and the authorities. The ad attempted to align the brand with activism but was widely condemned for trivializing serious social issues, particularly in light of the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement.
The imagery of Jenner, a white supermodel, handing a soda to a police officer to diffuse a protest was viewed as tone-deaf, given the real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities in confrontations with law enforcement. Critics pointed out that the ad seemed to reduce the complex realities of protests to a superficial moment of corporate goodwill. Social media users flooded platforms with memes and criticism, forcing Pepsi to pull the ad within 24 hours of its release. The company issued an apology, but the controversy lingered, and the campaign became a lasting symbol of corporate misjudgment.[1]

Heineken found itself at the center of a controversy in 2018 after releasing a commercial for its light beer featuring the tagline, “Sometimes, Lighter Is Better.” The ad showed a bartender sliding a Heineken Light past several people of color before it reached a lighter-skinned woman at the end of the bar. While the campaign was meant to promote the beer’s low-calorie content, the slogan and imagery sparked accusations of racism and insensitivity.
Many viewers, including prominent figures like Chance the Rapper, criticized the ad for its troubling racial connotations, interpreting the phrase “lighter is better” as implying a preference for lighter skin. Heineken responded by defending the ad, stating that the message was solely about the beer’s calories, but the backlash was too severe to ignore. The company eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology, but the damage to its reputation had already been done.[2]

Dolce & Gabbana’s 2018 ad campaign intended to celebrate the fusion of Italian and Chinese culture ahead of a Shanghai fashion show. The ads, however, sparked immediate backlash for their portrayal of a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks.

The ad featured a husband gifting his wife a Peloton bike for Christmas, and she then records her fitness journey throughout the year. While the commercial was intended to highlight personal transformation and empowerment, many viewers interpreted it as sexist and tone-deaf. The woman, who already appeared fit, was seen as pressured to maintain her physique for her husband’s approval.
Social media users were quick to lampoon the ad, creating memes that mocked its premise. Critics pointed out that the ad perpetuated unhealthy gender stereotypes, with some accusing Peloton of portraying the wife as anxious to meet her husband’s expectations. The backlash was so intense that Peloton’s stock dropped, and the company spent weeks managing the PR fallout.

Social media erupted in outrage, with many accusing the brand of perpetuating harmful racial stereotypes.
Celebrities, including The Weeknd, severed ties with H&M in response to the ad, and calls for boycotts spread across the internet.
