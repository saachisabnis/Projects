The Weeknd is back and hotter than ever with his new single "Dancing In The Flames."
Abel Tesfaye, the artist also known as The Weeknd, compares love to a car crash in the lead single from his upcoming sixth studio album Hurry Up Tomorrow. The album will be the final part to complete a trilogy, following 2020's After Hours and 2022's Dawn FM.
The accompanying music video reflects this sentiment, showing how love can feel like a car speeding through a storm before heartbreak crashes through and leaves you alone on the ground as you try your best to survive. After The Weeknd is thrown from his convertible and flipped through the air, he gets up and runs toward a bright light in the distance as lightning flashes all around, singing, "Everything's faded, we barely made it, the fire's raging, but you're still beautiful." However, he collapses before he can get there and we eventually see exactly what that mysterious light was as it draws closer.
