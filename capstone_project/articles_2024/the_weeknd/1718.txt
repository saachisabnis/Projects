AJ McLean doesn't seem to understand the hype around slang words like "rizz," and he clearly wants no part of it. The Backstreet Boy vented his frustrations about the new terms kids are saying nowadays during his time at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival Presented By Capital One in Las Vegas. While on the red carpet Friday night, September 20, McLean discussed the festival's diverse lineup of millennials and today's performers. The singer attempted to use "rizz" to describe the lineup before he made an outburst about the word and other phrases."We've gotta keep that rizz up," McLean said before he yelled, "What is this?! What is wrong with people today?" 
"Both of my daughters are in that Gen Alpha and I'm like 'Just don't call me bro and talk to me in English!'" he added. For the unfamiliar, "rizz" was added to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary in 2023. The slang word, which can be used as a noun or a verb, means "romantic appeal or charm" or "to charm or seduce." AJ McLean has two young daughters, Ava and Lyric with his ex-wife Rochelle Deanna Karidis. AJ was one of several celebrities who strolled down the red carpet on night one of the festival. *NSYNC singer Lance Bass also pulled up to the red carpet along with Golden Couple Tara and Hunter Davis-Woodhall, Christina Milian, and plenty more. Night two of the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival features performances from a star-studded lineup, including Big Sean, Doja Cat, Halsey, Hozier, Keith Urban, New Kids on the Block, The Weeknd, Victoria Mon√©t, and a special performance from Coldplay's Chris Martin. The show is going down on Saturday, September 21 beginning at 7:30 p.m. PST/10:30 p.m. EST live from the T-Mobile Arena. You can stream it exclusively on Hulu. If you missed any of the action this weekend, or just want to re-live it all, an iHeartRadio Music Festival special including highlights from the event will be available to stream on Hulu on October 7.
