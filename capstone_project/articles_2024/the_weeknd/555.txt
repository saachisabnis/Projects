The Weeknd recently shared a social media post that has fans wondering if next album could potentially be his last.
On Friday (May 24), the singer took to his Instagram Story where he quoted a fan page’s tweet about his live performance of his hit single “Save Your Tears” at the 2021 Billboard Awards. The TV hit saw him walking along a road while singing, as rows of cars came up behind him, parting ways right before they hit him.

“There was a lot of trust with those cars,” read the quote. “He didn’t seem nervous at all, which really weirded us out, because these cars were just barreling by him and he was calm, kept his composure, walked slow and just didn’t look back. It was kind of amazing.”
The Instagram Story post included a static shot from the performance, as well as the statement, “the end is near.”
Aside from hinting in 2022 that his last two albums, After Hours and DawnFM, were part of a trilogy; and another cryptic Instagram post earlier this year, The Weeknd has not been very forthcoming about his next project.
One collaborator, however, has at least confirmed that the Toronto native is back in the studio.

Metro also spoke about his rich collaborative relationship with The Weeknd: “The songs we did with The Weeknd, frequent collaborator of mine. ‘Low Life’ was the beginning of our journey, to now, which was with Future.
“I feel like it was just a full circle moment for him to appear between the two albums, like four times? That’s big. That’s family.”

The two albums Metro was referring to are We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, his back-to-back joint projects with Future that were released in March and April, respectively.
