Snoop Dogg took to social media to share his reaction to Drake using his and Tupac’s voices in his latest track, “Taylor Made,” which is aimed at Kendrick Lamar. It seems the West Coast Legend isn’t the biggest fan of his likeness being used with artificial intelligence. 
In a clip from his Instagram Live, the rapper appears to be in shock and awe. “They did what?” he says repeatedly. Snoop seems very curious about why he wasn’t included in this decision. 
Check out the clip below.

On Friday (April 19), Drake released his second diss track aimed at Kendrick Lamar, “Taylor-Made.” Before that, the Toronto rap star dropped off “Push Ups,” where he took shots at Lamar, Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Future, and more. He didn’t stop there. The rapper continued to troll the Compton rapper (as well as Metro Boomin and Ross) via his Instagram page.
