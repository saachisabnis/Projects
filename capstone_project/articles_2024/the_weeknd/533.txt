It's poetically fitting that one of the most significant music careers of the last 15 years appears to start and end with a trilogy. The focus is on The Weeknd's eagerly awaited continuation of Dawn FM and After Hours, which will not only mark the end of this chapter in his career but may also signal a change for his stage name. Recently, excitement for this project surged following his cinematic trailer on social media, which highlights the visual style and sound of his earlier albums from 2020. The closing segment features what seems to be a younger version of Abel Tesfaye surrounded by grass, accompanied by the message: "There are three chapters to this tale." Fans speculate that The Weeknd will soon ramp up the promotion for his upcoming album, especially with a one-off performance scheduled in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, on September 7. This follows earlier hints, including a potential collaboration with Apple, which have provided intriguing clues about what's ahead. Based on the new trailer, it seems this reinvention of the Canadian artist may represent a rebirth or transformation following the themes of death or purgatory explored in After Hours and Dawn FM. 
However, this remains speculative until the full album reveals its meaning. In the meantime, The Weeknd has had a notable year in 2024 without much effort, as he remains a part of the Kendrick Lamar and Drake feud. His contributions to Future and Metro Boomin's We (Still) Don't Trust You album series this year included references to the 6ix God, and his appearance in Kendrick's "Pop Out" added to this narrative. Despite not being deeply involved, it's remarkable that he remains a significant figure this year, showcasing his immense artistry. Additionally, Metro Boomin is confirmed to contribute production to The Weeknd's upcoming project. Considering the ambitious themes and musical styles of After Hours and Dawn FM, this next installment is expected to be another bold endeavor. While it's unclear if this will represent a sonic evolution or continue the established sound of the trilogy, fans can anticipate something special. Let's hope for more definitive updates following this trailer.
