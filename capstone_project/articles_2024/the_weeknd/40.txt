The Weeknd may have some words for Drake. 
The rap beef saga continues as A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd are the two newest artists to throw shots at Drake.
We we’ve seen The Weeknd and Drake collaborate on many songs together, however, it seems their relationship has gone astray. On the song, “All to Myself” off Future and Metro Boomin’s joint project We Still Don’t Trust You, The Weeknd seemingly gets somethings off his chest.
He sings: “These n-ggas always yappin’, yeah/ I promise that I got your back/ Ooh, look at how we movin’, baby/ They could never diss my brothers, baby/ When they got leaks in they operation/ I thank God that I never signed my life away/ And we never do the big talk/ They shooters makin’ TikToks/ Got us laughin’ in the Lambo.”
