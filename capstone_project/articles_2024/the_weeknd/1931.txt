2Pac‘s brother has admonished Drake for using his late brother’s voice in his viral diss track against Kendrick Lamar.
According to an article published by TMZ on Tuesday (April 23), Mopreme Shakur thinks it was inappropriate for the 6 God to use his sibling’s likeness to disrespect another rapper.

He reportedly feels that Drizzy should’ve gone one-on-one with K. Dot rather than bring out what he referred to as the “nuclear option.” Well aware of the Compton MC’s place in West Coast rap, he saw the computer-generated use of ‘Pac’s voice in said context to be uncalled for.
Finally, Mopreme told the outlet that he still can’t decide who the “winner” of the the Hip Hop battle royale is quite yet, because it is still too soon to land on a conclusion.

The joint in question was released by the Canadian superstar across social-media platforms last week.
Whereas the authenticity of his first counterattack was under speculation for a while, “Taylor Made Freestyle” openly embraces artificial intelligence with features from the voices of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg to convey alternate perspectives via lyrics that Drake wrote.

After using the two legends’ viewpoints to press his adversary to drop a response, the 37-year-old references Taylor Swift‘s new album and TDE boss Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith with the bars: “But now we gotta wait a fucking week ’cause Taylor Swift is your new Top/ And if you ’bout to drop, she gotta approve/ This girl really ’bout to make you act like you not in a feud/ She tailor made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop.”
Soon after the track went live, Akademiks revealed during a livestream that he received a text from the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker that reads: “Ak, you know I was trying to come off tour and relax. N-ggas done fucked up my whole feng shui. Now I gotta eat until this debate is done.”

Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar dropped “Like That” in late March, on which the California native devotes his entire guest verse to taking shots at Drizzy and J. Cole.
The beef has since escalated a great deal, with Rick Ross, The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky joining the K.Dot’s side and Cole withdrawing from the beef after releasing a diss track of his own.
