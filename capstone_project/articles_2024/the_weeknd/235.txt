Some contestants on Jeopardy! last week certainly got a bad rap from online critics.
Last Thursday’s (Jan. 4) episode featured contestants Kelly Shannon-Henderson, Matt Harvey, and Max Davison, per TV Insider, who were faced with a “New Jazz” category. The three were given the following clue: “Jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold can be heard on ‘Stay’ by this late rapper seen here.”
A picture of the correct individual, who would ultimately be revealed to be Mac Miller, was also shown. However, not one of the the three contestants could discern who he was.
Having gifted the world numerous hits such as “Ladders,” “Self Care,” and “Weeknd,” Miller died in 2018 from an accidental overdose, per Rolling Stone.
Following last week’s episode, viewers at home took to X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) to share their thoughts on the surprising slip-up.
One found it “sad” that no one could think of Miller’s name, another was in disbelief, and someone went as far as to call the three contestants “uncultured swines” for not knowing who Miller is. 
Another couldn’t conceive how no one knew the answer when “Stay,” what they deemed as “one of his best songs,” was mentioned in the clue.
WHO DOESNT KNOW MAC MILLER AND ONE OF HIS BEST SONGS #Jeopardy
OH MY GOD they SHOWED a PICTURE of him for the Jeopardy clue and nobody got Mac Miller?!?
They didn't know Mac Miller. Sigh. #Jeopardy
This certainly isn’t the first instance in which Jeopardy contestants have slipped up on seemingly simple answers pertaining to music. At the end of November, host Ken Jennings teased contestants that they “have annoyed Led Zeppelin fans everywhere” after none could guess the iconic classic rock band based off of their 1973 album “Houses of the Holy.”
About two weeks prior, other contestants couldn’t muster up country legend Garth Brooks‘ name after being given the hint of his CMA award-winning song “Friends in Low Places.” However, many were not prepared for Kyra Sedgwick being unable to guess Taylor Swift‘s “Welcome To New York” during the Dec. 8 Celebrity Jeopardy episode.
Jeopardy! airs on weeknights at 7/6c. Check out the website for your local listings.
