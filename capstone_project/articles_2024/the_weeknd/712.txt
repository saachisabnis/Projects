Hozier immediately captured the audience's attention at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival presented by Capital One, kicking off an awe-inspiring set with 2023 hit, "Nobody's Soldier." 
The icon proceeded to perform 2024 chartbuster "Too Sweet," as fans reverberated his lyrics back to the stage. After everyone took their whiskey neat, their coffee black, and their beds at three, the hitmaker serenaded the crowd with the sheer melodic mastery that is 2015's "Work Song" and closed out his set with 2013's "Take Me To Church." 
The dynamic hitmaker did in fact take everyone to church as the audience swayed back and forth to the beat of the familiar, timeless tune. Hozier thanked concertgoers for matching his energy and singing along with him before passing the baton off to Halsey. 
In a red carpet interview before the show, the "Eat Your Young" standout candidly unveiled the key to being a great storyteller. 
The star just wrapped up a massive North American tour that started in February and ran through September 17th. 
Other artists that took the stage as part of night two of this year's festival include Doja Cat, Keith Urban, The Weeknd, and more!
