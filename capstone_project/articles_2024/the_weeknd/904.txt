The Weeknd has extended his philanthropic reach by donating $2 million from his XO Humanitarian Fund to aid families in Gaza, aiming to supply 18 million loaves of bread. Collaborating with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the donation will facilitate the provision of 1,500 metric tons of fortified wheat flour, benefiting over 157,000 Palestinians. This gesture follows his earlier contribution of $2.5 million in December 2023, which provided food parcels weighing 820 metric tons, sustaining 173,000 Palestinians for a fortnight. Encouraging his fans to join the cause, The Weeknd amplifies the call for support to Gaza’s struggling populace.
The singer’s benevolence is a consistent theme in his philanthropic endeavors. In January, he allocated funds to the Los Angeles-based School on Wheels, aiding over 1,000 homeless students. His charitable footprint extends globally, with significant donations to causes in Ethiopia, Lebanon, Covid relief efforts, and more.
Corinne Fleischer, Director for the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe Region at WFP, lauds The Weeknd’s generosity, emphasizing its critical role in alleviating hunger in Gaza. Barron Segar, president and CEO of World Food Program USA, expresses gratitude for The Weeknd’s ongoing support, stressing the solvability of hunger with adequate funding and access.
The Weeknd’s contributions serve as a beacon of hope amidst Gaza’s looming famine, offering tangible relief to Palestinian families grappling with daily hunger. Through his unwavering advocacy and generosity, he exemplifies the power of collective action in addressing humanitarian crises.
