Cher stole the show when she performed at the 2024 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.
The Grammy winner, 78, took the stage as the headlining musical guest during the Tuesday, October 15, event in New York City. Cher rocked an all-black ensemble with sparkly cargo pants, a corseted top that tied in the front with a sheer long-sleeve. She paired the look with black boots as she performed a medley of her hit tracks including “Believe” and “Strong Enough.”
The brand’s Instagram account announced Cher’s performance in a September post.
“It’s a woman’s world, so it’s understood that you can’t have a fashion show without the mother of fashion herself — @Cher!” the caption read. “We’re beyond excited to announce she will officially be performing at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2024 on October 15. But she won’t be alone … stay tuned, more announcements are coming to round out our first-ever, all-women lineup.”
K-pop singer Lisa and Grammy nominee Tyla were later added to the list of musical performers for this year’s event, while Tyra Banks, Gigi Hadid, Adriana Lima, Ashley Graham, Candice Swanepoel and Barbara Palvin were among the models who walked the runway during the show.
Prior to Cher’s performance, previous musical guests at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show included Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Selena Gomez and Katy Perry.
This year marks the return of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show after the 2019 cancelation of the once annual event. The move came after the company faced scrutiny for its lack of inclusivity, leading to a total revamp of the brand and a six-year hiatus for the fashion show.
After reworking the company as a whole, Victoria’s Secret confirmed in May that the fashion show would be held for the first time since 2018.

“We’ve read the comments and heard you,” the brand wrote via Instagram at the time. “The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is BACK and will reflect who we are today, plus everything you know and love — the glamour, runway, wings, musical entertainment and more! Stay tuned … it only gets more iconic from here.”
The shifted focus of Victoria’s Secret is also represented in its new brand values statement, which was released in August 2023.
“We have moved from promoting an exclusionary view of what’s sexy to celebrating all women throughout every phase of their lives,” the statement read. “We will continue this work and look to be an industry leader in retail innovation, fashion, sustainability and continuous ingenuity — getting to the heart of what our diverse customer base wants.”
