Synopsis – Fri Oct 25 2024
Fair weather expected, as a low amplitude upper ridge settles in over most of the weeknd. So a beautiful Fall weeknd is in store for all. However, unsettled weather returns Sunday night into Tuesday as a deep upper trough sends a cold front through the region. This will bring on gusty winds, much cooler temperatures and mountain snow. Snow levels at this time look to be above 8K feet in Mammoth and the Sierra. Right now we are looking at ~6 inches of snow over Mammoth Mtn. Sunday night into Tuesday. For the Owens Valley, and a chance of rain / snow showers Monday into Tuesday. More updates on snow amounts Monday…DMATT
