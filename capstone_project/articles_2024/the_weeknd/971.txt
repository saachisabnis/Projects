Jennifer Lopez’s penchant for high-profile relationships is so well-known that bookies are now taking bets on who she’ll end up with next.
After officially filing for divorce from actor and director Ben Affleck on Tuesday, August 20, Jennifer Lopez is now back on the market, leading to some linemakers offering odds on who she’ll be with next, as noted by the Los Angeles Times.
The odds are largely absurd, however, as the top choice is Eminem at +800. After Eminem is The Weeknd and a reunion with Alex Rodriguez at +1000. Other notable longshots include A-list actors such as Matthew McConaughey (who is married), Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, and Jake Gyllenhaal.
Whatever Lopez does decide to do next, whether that be personally or professionally, will obviously be a big decision for the pop star and actress as 2024 has been a difficult year for both her career and her personal life. Not only did she file for divorce from Affleck, but she also canceled her entire summer tour, with many speculating that the decision was made due to low ticket sales.
Lopez has had a bit of success as an actress this year, however, as her sci-fi film Atlas, although largely critically derided, racked up impressive viewership on Netflix. Her next film, Unstoppable — a biopic about one-legged NCAA champion wrestler Anthony Robles that she stars in alongside Jharrel Jermone, Don Cheadle, Bobby Cannavale, and Michael Pena — will premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6. The Prime Video film will then have a limited theatrical release in December before hitting the streaming service.
Despite his company Artists Equity producing Unstoppable, reports indicate that Affleck will not be at the premiere of the film. Lopez and Matt Damon, who Affleck co-founded Artists Equity with, will be there. Lopez’s other upcoming film, a remake of Kiss of the Spider Woman, is also being produced by Artists Equity.
