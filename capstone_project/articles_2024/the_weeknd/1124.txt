Drake has filed legal documents accusing Universal Music Group and Spotify of coming together to fake the popularity of Kendrick Lamar‘s diss song against him, “Not Like Us.”
According to The Independent, Drizzy’s legal team filed a “pre-action” petition in a Manhattan court on Monday (November 25), alleging UMG used bots, payola and other methods to inflate the chart-topping song. This is not a lawsuit, but a step required by New York State to secure information before officially filing.

“UMG did not rely on chance, or even ordinary business practices,” the docs read. “It instead launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves.”
The filing also alleges that the label paid Spotify to promote “Not Like Us” to users searching for unrelated songs and artists. Additionally, it claims UMG paid Apple to have Siri intentionally redirect users requesting songs from Drake’s catalog, instead offering “Not Like Us” as a result. It also claims the company used bots to burnish the song’s numbers.

Drake is asking the court to order UMG and Spotify to gather all relevant documents ahead of a pending lawsuit.
According to the report, UMG has so far “refused to engage” over the issue – telling Drake to sue Kendrick instead.

While Kendrick has not yet responded, Top Dawg Entertainment’s Punch has seemingly addressed the filing, writing on X shortly after the news hit, “Naaaaaahhhh. The rap streets is done. SMH.”
UMG responded to Variety.

“The suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue,” a rep for the company told the publication. “We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.”
The news comes just after Drake’s recent livestream where he took shots at several enemies, including Kendrick Lamar.

The 6 God appeared on Canadian streamer xQc’s Kick channel this past weekend where he began by jabbing his fierce rival Kendrick while introducing himself to viewers.
“I’m here — mind, body and soul fully intact, in case you were wondering. You need facts to take me out; fairytales won’t do it,” he said.

The defiant statement was a clear reference to claims in Kendrick’s various diss tracks about Drake behaving inappropriately with young girls, keeping the company of sexual predators and fathering a secret daughter.
The OVO Sound hitmaker also dissed Steve Lacy by calling him a “fragile” opp and told xQc to turn off The Weeknd‘s music when he began to play the singer’s 2016 hit “Starboy.”

Kendrick reacted to the stream in a text exchange with his friend Reli, who posted screenshots of the conversation on his Instagram Stories.
In the messages, Reli says to Kendrick: “You done turned blood into a streamer on Phillies [laughing face emojis],” to which the rapper replies with several laughing face emojis of his own.

Reli then says: “That’s a damn shame,” prompting Kendrick to ask: “He trippin??!”
Reli replies: “Blood don’t won’t [sic] no smoke Philly gang,” before censoring his next message.
