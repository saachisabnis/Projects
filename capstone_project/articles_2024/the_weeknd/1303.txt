Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are on a promotional run for their new Vultures 2 album and recently chopped it up with Real 92.3's Big Boy in an in-depth interview.
On Friday (March 15), Ye and Ty sat down for an exclusive interview following their performance at Rolling Loud California. The duo touched on a number of topics including  their successful collab album Vultures 1, working together, Ye's daughter North's budding rap career and the music industry. Here are a few of the other big highlights that came out of the interview.
Elsewhere in the interview below, Ye also addresses his recent rant where he dissed Drake, Adidas, Hailey Bieber and others.
The new interview comes on the heels of Ye and Ty headlining Rolling Loud California 2024 on Thursday (March 14). Earlier this week, they performed two Vultures 2 listening events in San Francisco and Phoenix. Vultures 2 was supposed to be released on March 8 but has yet to drop. Ye recently noted he plans to sell the album on his website for $20 instead of releasing it on digital streaming platforms. The newly formed duo are still riding high off the success of Vultures 1, which spent two weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart. The single "Carnival" featuring Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid is currently No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
