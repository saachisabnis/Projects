Kendrick Lamar seems to have responded to Drake‘s diss song and J. Cole‘s apology with a track of his own, thought its authenticity is still being debated.
On Monday (April 15), audio believed to be the first minute-and-a-half of a K.Dot diss song aimed at Drizzy and Cole surfaced online.
Almost immediately, the track was met with skepticism as fans and peers alike have been questioning whether or not it was generated by artificial intelligence.

The joint aims squarely at the “In The Morning” MCs with lines like “I dominated your favorite rapper you idolize/ My silence is enough to make n-ggas apologize“ and “Now that it’s direct, it’s leaked disses from burner pages and all/ Insecure behavior from n-ggas y’all call Gods.”
Hear the audio below and judge for yourself:
Many observers speculated that the song was “AI,” which could mean two things: that the song was either entirely computer-generated, which is unlikely for a variety of reasons; or that a real person composed and recorded it, and processed the recorded material through a vocal filter that mirror’s Kendrick voice — the latter was used to create the fake Drake and The Weeknd track that went viral last year.

Rapper Daylyt has a long history with Kendrick, and he even took to social media to declare that the track is bogus.
DJ Dahi, who produced a number of the Compton native’s songs such as “Money Trees,” referred to “AI diss tracks” in a tweet soon after the clip in question began making the rounds.
“We need Google authentications to make sure all this shit is real or not,” he wrote.
Rapper and educatorMickey Factz was also if the track in question was artificial, to which he bluntly responded with: “Yes.”
The ongoing rap beef was initially sparked by Kendrick’s verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” — as a result, Drake and Rick Ross are now trading shots both on record and on social media as tensions continue to proliferate.
