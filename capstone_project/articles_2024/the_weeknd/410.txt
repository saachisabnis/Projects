Over the last few weeks, Drake hasn’t had the greatest luck in the world. Not only is he the subject of five diss records from his former collaborator, Kendrick Lamar, but he is also the target of diss tracks from Future, Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd and several others. To top it all off, he’s being sued by Members Only and fans haven’t exactly cozied up to his latest singles.
First, he was clowned for his guest verse on “U My Everything” with Sexyy Red. Then, he was mocked for the seemingly AI-generated “Wah Gwan Delilah” track with Snowd4y. Well, it appears Drake feels the third time will be the charm. Earlier this week, the Toronto native thanked models who “were picked for [Drake’s] next video.” More recently, Livingston “DJ Akademiks” Allen confirmed that new music from the hitmaker was on the way.
“New Drake otw,” he tweeted.
Drake has released more music within the last few years than he has at any point in his career. Since 2020, Drake has released three solo albums, a Scary Hours EP and a joint album with 21 Savage. Not to be forgotten, he’s worked on Beyoncé’s Renaissance, Gunna’s DS4Ever, Future’s I Never Liked You, YSL’s Slime Language II and Jack Harlow’s Come Home The Kids Miss You.
There is no release date for the track just yet, but with Kendrick Lamar preparing for a concert on Juneteenth, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the track drop sometime soon.
