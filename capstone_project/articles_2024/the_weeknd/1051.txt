Drake has long been able to leverage social media to his advantage when it comes to trolling and Metro Boomin is his latest victim. 

	After sniping for a headshot at Metro Boomin by name on Drizzy’s leaked “Push Ups,” he continued to troll the producer with a clip from 2002’s Drumline movie on Monday (April 15).

	“Metro, shut yo ho-a– up and make some drums, n—a,” Drake raps on the diss track.

	The blockbuster scene finds Nick Cannon’s character having his late-night drumline tryout attempting to convince band leaders he’s worthy of being on the P1 line without reading a note of music.

	But instead of Cannon, Drake hilariously Photoshops Metro’s face on him playing the drums, which fittingly aligns with the bar Drake used to jab Metro on “Push Ups.”

	










	In a way, the Instagram Story post signifies Drake’s first time publicly recognizing his “Push Ups” diss track. An earlier version of the scathing diss surfaced on the internet on Saturday (April 13) and DJ Akademiks premiered the CDQ version hours later. 

	In addition to name-dropping Metro Boomin, Drake appeared to have smoke for Kendrick Lamar, Future, The Weeknd, Rick Ross and more. 

	At this point, It’s unclear exactly what ignited the friction between Metro and Drake while some fans speculated on social media that their issues were over a woman. 

	At the top of 2023, a leaked Drake verse appeared on Metro’s Heroes & Villains track “Trance” and he explained not having the 6 God on the final version alongside Young Thug and Travis Scott. 

	“Really, it was a song I had did with [Travis Scott] and [Young Thug], originally for my album,” Metro recalled in an interview with Gangsta Grillz Radio. “I was in the studio with Drake one time because we were gonna do some stuff for my album. He just wanted to hear some songs from my album, and then he heard that one. He really wanted to get on it, but I was letting him know that it was really just done for real. I was just set on how it was. I was like, ‘Bro, I ain’t trying to sell you no dream. I’m locked in where it was.’ He had hit me and was just like, ‘Let me see if there’s anything you could add to it.’ He was like, ‘If you don’t like it, then whatever.’”

	Months later, he appeared to voice his frustration on social media with Her Loss sweeping hip-hop award categories like Top Rap Album at the 2023 Billboard Music Awards. 

	“Yet Her Loss keeps winning rap album of the year over H&V,” he wrote to his IG Story. “Proof that award shows are just politics and not for me. Idc about awards honestly, the true award and REWARD is knowing that the music I spend so much time on brings joy to people’s everyday lives.” 

	










	Drake subliminally responded on his Instagram Story while quoting Jay-Z’s “Heart of the City.” “Damn, little mans, I’m just tryna do me/ If the record’s two mil I’m just tryna move three,” he posted.
