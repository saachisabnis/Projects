Mick Foley and Triple H faced off in a Street Fight at the WWE Royal Rumble 2000 pay-per-view event. The match featured many violent moments, including a spot with some thumbtacks.
During a recent interview with “WWE Retrospective,” Foley revealed that he had been told not to use the tacks but did so anyway. He said,
“If I did it without any crowd, TV camera, it would be one of the worst feelings in the world, But when you get that response, the exact response you’re looking for, It can anesthetize the pain to a great degree.”
He continued, “We were under a strict edict, no thumbtacks. Triple H said, you have the tacks? I said, they’re already under the ring. We went with the “it’s better to do it and ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission” and the match was such a huge success that we didn’t even get yelled at.”
