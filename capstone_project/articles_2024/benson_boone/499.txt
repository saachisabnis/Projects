Over the past few days, Portugal’s NOS Alive has unveiled a number of stellar new names for the festival’s 2025 edition, including country-pop sensation CMAT, alternative polymath St Vincent, and Baltimore favourites Future Islands. 
Elsewhere on the lineup, The Backseat Lovers, Noah Kahan, Benson Boone and Artemas will all make their NOS debuts, while Olivia Rodrigo - the first headliner to be confirmed for next year - is set to bring her record-breaking GUTS World Tour to the NOS main stage on the festival’s opening night. 
Due to take place at Passeio Marítimo de Algés (near Lisbon) between 10th-12th July, NOS Alive 2025 will follow this year’s ace 16th iteration, which saw the likes of Dua Lipa, Pearl Jam, and Arcade Fire deliver memorable headline sets.
Keep your eyes peeled for further lineup announcements coming soon; in the meantime, you can revisit our review of 2024’s weekender below, and nab tickets for NOS Alive 2025 here.
