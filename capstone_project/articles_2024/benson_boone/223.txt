This marks her first time on the dance floor since her emergency brain surgery last year.
Dancing With the Stars judge Derek Hough shared an emotional moment with his wife and former DWTS troupe member, Hayley Erbert, as she returned to the stage after undergoing emergency brain surgery last year. During the "Dedication"-themed episode on October 15, she danced to a stunning orchestral rendition of Benson Boone's "Beautiful Things" with her husband, marking her first public performance since her recovery.
"Last night was such a powerful, full-circle moment for us. To be back in the ballroom, performing together again. Feels like an absolute miracle. There were moments when it seemed impossible that we’d ever get back to this place," Derek wrote alongside a video of their performance on Instagram the following day. He went on to thank their loved ones and the medical professionals who saved Hayley's life and played "a huge part" in her recovery."Last night was just the beginning of sharing our story, and we can’t wait to take you along on the rest of this journey. We love you all so much, and we’re just overwhelmed with gratitude," he finished his statement on their joint Instagram post. Catch their full performance below (and, seriously, grab your tissues):
Fans showed their support for the couple in their comments section, with one writing, "This absolutely wrecked me, from start of the package to the end of the dance. Her strength is nothing short of inspiring. 🥺❤️." Contestant Jenn Tran added, "What a gift this was to watch and to hear about the unwavering love you have for each other was so special❤️🥹." 
In December 2023, Hayley was hospitalized for a form of brain bleeding called cranial hematoma amid their Symphony of Dance tour stop in Washington D.C. She's been recovering as she had to re-learn how to walk and wear a helmet to protect her skull. Derek revealed that at the time, doctors said it was unlikely that she'd survive, and "even if she does make it, she won't be the same person." 
He also shared the relief he felt when she woke up from her life-changing surgery. "She goes, 'What happened? Weren't we just dancing?' I can't even tell you, just knowing that she was there, she was in there, the relief I felt. She was Hayley. She was my wife. And then the journey began."
