If you need another reason to drink this Thanksgiving, the Bears will be on your TV screen.
Until this year, the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving felt like a punishment.
I'm not saying anything Lions fans are unaware of. The franchise has never appeared in the Super Bowl, and they have 116 fewer wins than losses as a team. Ouch.
Luckily, the Lions are good, but playing the Lions role from yesteryear are the 2024 Chicago Bears. Thankfully, we're getting a good halftime show.
With Shaboozey, it's all about having a good time with a song sure to get us in the spirit.
Yes, the same talented artist who brought us A Bar Song (Tipsy) is set to light up the halftime stage at this year's Bears-Lions Thanksgiving game in Detroit.
As a long-suffering Bears fan, it's easy to say the lone bright spot of the athletic contest will be Shaboozey singing the song that put him on the map.
Not even the stink of the Chicago Bears can ruin Shaboozey in 2024, as he was just nominated for not one but six different Grammy Awards.
Can it get any better? If you're a Bears fan, the answer is obvious, but since they'll never change, at least we'll be entertained at half.
The Bears and Lions square off on Thursday, November 28, with kick-off set for 11:30 a.m.
The good news is that the Detroit Lions' record is, unsurprisingly, not great: 37-44-2 and 3-7 in their last ten games. So maybe the Bears have a shot? I must be a little "tipsy."
