The weekend that was

Colt Gray reportedly sent an alarming early-morning text that prompted the warning.• Boeing and the Machinists union, which represents 33,000 of its employees on the West Coast, have reached a tentative deal that could avoid a strike that had been set to start this Friday.• Three Israeli border guards were killed in a shooting at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, the Israeli Emergency Services said. The identity of the assailant is unknown, and the crossing has been closed.• Residents are being told to remain vigilant as a manhunt continues for an “armed and dangerous” person of interest in the shooting that wounded five people on Interstate 75 in Laurel County, Kentucky, authorities said.• Sixty-five people in nine states have been sickened by a salmonella outbreak linked to recalled eggs, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The week ahead

MondayApple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 with embedded artificial intelligence. In June, Apple announced a slew of generative AI features for the iPhone during its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. And while iPhone 15 Pro Max users will likely be able to access some of the AI features, the iPhone 16 is expected to be the first device designed fully with AI in mind. Generative AI enables tools to create written work, images and even audio in response to prompts from users.
TuesdayVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will square off in their first — and potentially only — presidential debate in Philadelphia. The rules for the event, hosted by ABC News, will largely mirror the terms used by CNN for its June 27 debate, including that microphones will be muted as the other candidate speaks and no studio audience will be present, according to the network, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. Harris’ camp had lobbied for the mics to remain on for the duration of the debate to “fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates,” to no avail. CNN will air ABC’s debate live and provide extensive pre-debate coverage and post-debate analysis.
McDonald’s is giving its McFlurry a makeover by eliminating the plastic, dome-shaped lid and serving the ice cream treat in a new cardboard cup that has four flaps to cover the top. The update is the latest in the company’s attempts at making environmentally friendly changes, such as reducing plastic use and lowering greenhouse gas emissions from its offices and restaurants.
WednesdaySeptember 11 marks 23 years since the terror attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Flight 93 over Shanksville, Pennsylvania. (Editor’s note: The linked gallery contains graphic images. Viewer discretion is advised.)
