Madison Beer brought all the holiday vibes wrapped up in a big bow, as she covered "Please Come Home For Christmas." She also sang fan favorites like "Home To Another One," "Reckless," "Selfish," and "Make You Mine."

Twenty One Pilots' Josh Dun did a backflip off of their piano on stage after joining Tyler Joseph who was already standing up there.

The guys also performed "Overcompensate," "Holding on to You," "Vignette," "The Craving," "Tear In My Heart," "Heathens," and "Stressed Out."
