Sony Music Publishing returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 Songs publishers ranking for the third quarter and held on to the top spot among Top Radio Airplay publishers for the 14th consecutive quarter. 

	The publisher, which had finished a close second to Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) in the second quarter, scored its dual wins with a share of 67 tracks on Hot 100 Songs and 63 songs on Top Radio Airplay, including Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — the top tune on both charts this quarter and one that benefited the quarter’s top four publishers, which all have shares of the track. SMP also counts itself as the publishing home of the Top Radio Airplay writer of the quarter, Tommy Richman, who penned and performed the hit “Million Dollar Baby.”

	The top Hot 100 Songs writer for the quarter was Zach Bryan, who notched four songs on the chart this quarter, including “Pink Skies” and “28.” He’s represented by Warner Chappell Music, which took second place for a second consecutive quarter on the Top Radio Airplay ranking and rose from No. 3 to No. 2 on the Hot 100 Songs chart. Its shares of 64 tracks on the former chart and 59 on the latter translate to market shares of 23.34% and 25.32%, respectively.

	After a big second quarter at the top of Hot 100 Songs, UMPG landed at No. 3 on both charts with stakes in 48 Top Radio Airplay songs and 51 on the Hot 100 Songs list — good for market shares of 20.23% and 22.41%, respectively. 

	While the big three publishers jockey for those top slots, Kobalt has consistently maintained its No. 4 berth on both rankings for years. Like the three majors, it owns a piece of “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” In the third quarter, Kobalt’s share of Top Radio Airplay songs increased to 48 from 43 in the second quarter and its quota of Hot 100 Songs rose over the same period from 32 to 36. That equates to an 11.43% market share on Radio Airplay and 10.83% on Hot 100 Songs. 

	Hipgnosis sustained its fifth-place ranking quarter to quarter. Its top track on both charts was “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter, which was No. 5 on Top Radio Airplay and No. 4 on Hot 100 Songs. 

	Position Music, a relative newcomer to Billboard’s Publishers Quarterly, stuck around for another quarter, finishing ninth on Top Radio Airplay and seventh on Hot 100 Songs thanks to its share of “Beautiful Things” by Benson Boone.

	With the arrival of Position comes the departure of an outlier: Tracy Chapman’s publishing company, Purple Rabbit Music. It finished in the top 10 on both charts for a full year, kept aloft by the success of Luke Combs’ cover of her 1988 Hot 100 No. 6 hit, “Fast Car.”
