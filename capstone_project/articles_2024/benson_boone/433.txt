Taylor Swift's UK fans are buzzing with excitement as the pop icon is set to grace British shores in just a few days, and there's fresh news for those eagerly awaiting her arrival.
The 'Anti-Hero' hitmaker has revealed three new support acts that will be joining her on The Eras Tour in the UK next month.
Until now, Paramore was the sole confirmed act, the American rockers famed for anthems like 'Misery Business', 'Still Into You', and 'Hard Times'.

However, Taylor wasn't content with just one supporting act and took to social media to share her enthusiasm about the additional artists who will be performing with her in the UK this year.
"I just found out Fortnight is #1 on the UK airplay chart! ! ! ! " she exclaimed. "You guys are amazing and I can't wait to see you so soon! Thought this might be a fun time to announce the first group of opening acts I'll be adding to the London shows, going on before Paramore.", reports the Express.
She continued, expressing her personal taste in music and anticipation: "I chose artists whose music I love listening to, and I can't wait for them to add an extra jolt of excitement to our shows at Wembley Stadium in June."
With these words, Taylor confirmed that she and Paramore will be joined by Mette, Griff, and Benson Boone. Mette, the 33 year old American songstress, is renowned for tracks such as 'MAMA's EYES' and 'FOR THE PEOPLE'.
Griff, a 23 year old English singer-songwriter, captured hearts with her debut single 'Mirror Talk' back in 2019. The final act supporting Taylor Swift is the American singer-songwriter, 21 year old Benson Boone. He got his start in the industry by sharing TikTok videos and eventually auditioning for American Idol.
Griff expressed her excitement about being invited on The ERAS Tour with Taylor Swift. In an announcement, she exclaimed: "TAYLOR SWIFT HAS INVITED ME ON THE ERAS TOUR! ! ! ! ! ! 8 yr old me who had fearless on repeat wouldn't believe this. So unbelievably grateful to Taylor for all the love she's shown me and my music. See you at Wembley on June 22nd."
Mette also chimed in about this new chapter saying: "It's a new ERA for ya girl... Opening the "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" on June 21st at Wembley Stadium in London. Thank you @taylorswift13 Never been so excited in my entire life! ! ! #TSTheErasTour."
Benson also shared his own excitement about being part of Swift's tour: "@taylorswift so excited to be part of the show thank you for having me."
Obviously, these three young artists are still making names for themselves, which makes it quite surprising for Taylor to include them in her massive tour. After all, it's considered the biggest live concert experience of our times.
This will no doubt excite fans who've managed to snag tickets, but those who missed out might be left feeling a bit let down. But don't lose hope just yet.
