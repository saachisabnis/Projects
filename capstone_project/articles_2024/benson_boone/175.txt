(Gray News) – Taylor Swift has once again made history on the Billboard charts, thanks to the massive debut of her new album “The Tortured Poets Department.”
On Monday, Billboard announced that Swift has swept the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, a new record for any artist in history.
Swift was already the record holder, being the only artist to ever claim the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 when she released her album “Midnights” in 2022.
Now, not only has she done it a second time, but she also pushed herself to greater heights by claiming the top 14.
Here are the top 14 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, dated May 4, all by Swift:
Another artist does not touch this week’s chart until No. 15 with Benson Boone’s song “Beautiful Things.”
The online chart will refresh the newest updates starting Tuesday.
“Fortnight” became Swift’s 12th No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.
“Fortnight” joins these other Swift songs that hit No. 1:
Swift is only the eighth artist in history to have 12 or more No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, joining the ranks of artists like The Beatles and Michael Jackson.
The only artists in history to achieve such a feat are:
“Fortnight” hitting No. 1 pushed Swift past Whitney Houston, who has 11 No. 1 hits.
This week, Swift also landed her 14th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with “The Tortured Poets Department,” tying her with Jay-Z. To date, only The Beatles have more, with 19.
Swift is on a short break from touring right now but will begin the next leg of the Eras Tour in Paris on May 9.
Billboard has a running list of every record Swift has made on its charts.
