	Sporting a smart suit, the Washington singer, songwriter and TikTok standout stopped by NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon for a rendition of “Beautiful Things.” Lifting from his LP Fireworks & Rollerblades (via Night Street Records/Warner Records), “Beautiful Things” has had an impressive, global ride, logging seven nonconsecutive weeks atop the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart, five atop Australia’s ARIA Chart, and is on track for a fourth week at No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart. In the U.S., “Beautiful Things” peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. On YouTube, the official music video has passed 100 million views in just two months. For his late night spot, Boone lead a full a full backing band, a taste of the world tour that kicked off last week in Chicago.

	“Man,” he told Billboard ahead of his current jaunt, “all I’ve been thinking about is the tour, and I’ll be going some places that I’ve never been before. But after the tour, and after all the shows, I’m really looking forward to just being with my friends. I think we’re gonna go on a trip to Greece and have two weeks and just live my life.”
