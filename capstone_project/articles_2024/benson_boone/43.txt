iHeartRadio’s 102.7 KIIS FM Jingle Ball concert turned the Intuit Dome in Inglewood into a festive spectacle on Jan. 6, blending a fast-paced showcase of chart-topping artists with moments of holiday cheer. The night unfolded with a high-energy rhythm as performers took turns gracing the stage, delivering bite-sized sets ranging from three to 25 minutes. Between acts, the audience was kept entertained by celebrity appearances and even holiday-themed karaoke. The result was an hours-long celebration of music, dancing, and spirited surprises.
Here are a few of our favorite highlights from the night.
As the clock struck 11:11—a nod to SZA’s well-known connection with angel numbers—radio hosts took to the stage to announce the headliner.
A sneak peek of her and Keke Palmer’s upcoming film “One of Them Days,” debuting Jan. 17, filled the venue with even more excitement just before she came out.
SZA’s performance felt deeply personal and spiritually moving, a sentiment amplified by her custom staging. Emerging from a spaceship surrounded by greenery, larger-than-life tree branches, and green leaves, SZA transformed the arena into a nature-filled dreamscape.
Her setlist celebrated the breadth of her career, from her viral “SOS” hits like “Kill Bill” which was complete with a samurai sword battle, and “Snooze” to fan-favorites from “CTRL” like “Broken Clocks” and “The Weekend.” Fans sang along word-for-word, some with tears in their eyes, as SZA’s lyrics about love and heartbreak struck a collective chord. The emotional high point came as she closed with “Good Days,” seated on a tree trunk and sharing, “I know times are scary, but we have love, we have God, and we have us.”
True to her essence, SZA’s outfit was effortlessly authentic—Adidas track pants, a Gucci scarf as a crop top, and puka shell necklaces—reminding fans that even in the spotlight, she remains grounded.
For Madison Beer, performing on the main stage was an emotional milestone. Reflecting on how her journey with Jingle Ball began six years ago at the pre-show Village stage, Beer paused mid-set to wipe away a few tears. “Six years ago, I played the pre-show. So, to be on the main stage is a huge honor,” she said, crediting KIIS FM for supporting her early career.
Dressed in a festive green velvet Santa dress with faux-fur trim and black combat boots, Beer delivered an endearing mix of hits like “Reckless” and “Selfish,” as well as a heartfelt rendition of “Please Come Home for Christmas.” Her growth as an artist was palpable, and the crowd embraced her every moment.
K-pop megastars NCT Dream brought major energy to the stage, performing in sleek black-and-white suits with their signature jaw-dropping choreography. Their set, featuring tracks like “SOS” and “When I’m With You,” blended upbeat pop and dance music with a touch of anime-inspired visuals.
“We just finished our world tour, and the last time we were here, we played the Intuit Dome,” they shared, receiving roaring cheers from their devoted fanbase. Their performance was a testament to the global impact of K-pop, with fans showing up in droves to support the group.
T-Pain took the night to another level with a high-energy, nostalgia-filled set that had the audience on their feet from start to finish. Backed by his longtime collaborator DJ Montay, the rapper powered through mid-2000s hits like “Buy U A Drank,” “Sprung,” and Kanye West’s “Good Life.”
The arena erupted during his closing anthem, “All I Do Is Win,” solidifying his status as one of the night’s biggest crowd-pleasers. His performance was a masterclass in showmanship, bridging generations of fans and reminding everyone why his music remains timeless.
Megan Trainor followed T-Pain with an all-white Christmas outfit that included a faux-fur hat, skirt, and gogo boots, jokingly admitting it was “terrifying” to perform after his incredible set. Her cheerful demeanor and hits like “Made You Look” and “Dear Future Husband” kept the night engaging.
Trainor’s set also featured a surprise duet with T-Pain on “Been Like This,” which she called “the greatest moment of my life, though she assured fans her husband still ranks higher on her love list. She made a point to connect with fans throughout her performance, waving to the upper levels and shouting heartfelt greetings to her family in the crowd.
The night began to wind down, but not without a couple of unforgettable performances. Benson Boone brought a spirited flair to the stage, blending his powerful vocals with what can only be described as a mini acrobatics show. Between pouring his heart into tracks like Be Somebody, Cry, Slow It Down, and Beautiful Things, he pulled off an impressive series of flips and cartwheels. My aisle mates and I couldn’t resist turning it into a game, tallying a grand total of five mid-air stunts. For someone giving it his all vocally while flipping across the stage, Boone managed to keep the audience both captivated and thoroughly entertained.
Tate McRae followed with a show-stopping entrance that took fans back to the early 2000s. Re-creating the iconic Mean Girls “Jingle Bell Rock” with three female backup dancers, the crowd ate it up completely. Decked out in a festive red corset outfit with matching shorts and faux fur accents, she commanded the stage. Her setlist, featuring tracks like “Exes,” “It’s OK I’m OK” and “Greedy,” showcased her dual talents as a dancer and vocalist.
Before launching into “You Broke Me First,” McRae took a moment to reflect. “I’ve been singing in my room since I was 13 and posting every Friday on YouTube. It all started in my dad’s basement, and I wrote this song when I was 16, and it changed my life. So if you know it, please sing along.” With over a billion streams to its name, the crowd didn’t need much convincing, joining in word for word to close out her set on a high note.

Where: Intuit Dome, 3930 W Century Blvd, Inglewood
