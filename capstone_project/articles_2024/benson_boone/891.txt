Songwriter John Ryan has signed a global publishing agreement with Warner Chappell Music.
Originally from Rochester, New York, Ryan wrote his first song in third grade and learned to play the guitar and piano at a young age. He later attended Berklee College of Music, where he fronted two bands, penned his own material and began producing. After graduating in 2010, Ryan moved to L.A. to pursue a career as a songwriter and producer. In 2012, he landed his first big cut with One Direction’s hit “Story of My Life,” which reached the yop 10 on the Billboard charts and has streamed over a billion times.
To date, Ryan’s catalog has surpassed 30 billion streams and he has collaborated with top artists including Sabrina Carpenter on “Feather” and “Because I Liked a Boy;” One Direction on “Drag Me Down,” “Night Changes” and “Steal My Girl;” Thomas Rhett on “Look What God Gave Her” “Beautiful As You” and “Cold (feat. Future)” and Niall Horan on “Slow Hands” and “Heaven.”
Ryan most recently partnered with Carpenter and co-wrote and produced six songs on her album Short n’ Sweet, which debuted at No. 1 this week on the Billboard 200. He also recently teamed with Rhett on his latest album, About A Woman, as well as Teddy Swims on his single “The Door.” Over the past decade, he’s worked with the likes of Harry Styles, Benson Boone, Maren Morris and Maroon 5,  among others.
“John’s career as a pop powerhouse is inevitable,” says WCM President, North America, Ryan Press. “The way he connects with artists and his songs resonate with listeners underscores that talent, and there are many more great songs to come.”
“I’m thrilled to be working with Ryan, Gabz, Katy, and the rest of the WCM team,” says Ryan. “They’ve been incredibly supportive of my songwriting since day one, and I am excited to begin this new chapter of my career as a Warner Chappell writer.”
