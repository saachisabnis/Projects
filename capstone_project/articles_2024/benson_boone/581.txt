1. Taylor SwiftNo surprises here. Taylor had us in a chokehold with her latest album, and we’re not mad about it. Like most years, Maine was full-on Swiftie Nation in 2024.
2. Zach BryanZach's heartfelt lyrics and gravelly vocals struck a chord with Mainers this year. Whether you were driving down a quiet backroad or bundled up by the fire, his raw, emotional tunes felt like the perfect soundtrack for life in Vacationland
3. Morgan WallenWhether you love country or you’re just country curious, Morgan Wallen’s catchy anthems have been at every barbecue in the state, remaining a top Maine artist for the second year in a row.
4. Noah KahanNew England’s folk-pop golden boy makes the list, proving that our collective seasonal depression has a soundtrack. Remember when he played the State Theatre in Portland October of 2022 before he blew up? Yeah, kicking myself for not going to that one.
5. DrakeMaine might feel miles away from Drake’s usual vibes, but apparently, we’ve been pretending we’re living it up in Toronto instead of Portland. The man can make you feel rich even when you’re budgeting for groceries.
1. “Stick Season” by Noah KahanThis track is basically Maine’s unofficial anthem at this point. I feel like everywhere I went this year, this song got at least one spin.
2. “I Remember Everything (feat. Kacey Musgraves)” by Zach BryanYeah, it’s the Maine vibe: emotional, beautiful, and slightly rugged.
3. “Beautiful Things” by Benson BooneRaw emotion and a soothing melody, this song finds beauty even in life’s messiest moments. Wow, Maine, we were emotional this year.
4. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” by ShaboozeyYup, the dude that came out of nowhere and gave us the summer 2024 party anthem. This banger had us cheers-ing craft beers and dancing at every summer event we went to.
5. “I Had Some Help (Feat. Morgan Wallen)” by Post MalonePosty and Wallen teaming up? It’s the bromance anthem none of us knew we needed.
1. The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology by Taylor SwiftWhat did you expect? Pretty sure this one ranked at least somewhere in the top 5 in each state in the US.
2. Stick Season by Noah KahanThis album is like a warm hug on a cold day—it’s been spinning here nonstop this year.
3. One Thing At A Time by Morgan WallenCountry music in the Pine Tree state has always been a thing, so it's not surprising to see Morgan on Maine's Wrapped list for a second year.
4. The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess by Chappell RoanThree big hits, almost simoultaneously, brought some flair to Maine this year, and we loved every second of it. Sometimes you need a Midwest queen to shake things up.
5. Zach Bryan by Zach BryanZach Bryan’s self-titled album became the go-to for moody nights by the fire pit. If you didn’t hear this on your neighbor’s Bluetooth speaker, were you even outside?
