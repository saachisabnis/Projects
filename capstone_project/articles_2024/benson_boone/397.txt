The Coachella 2025 lineup has been revealed and there are seven rock and metal acts that are set to perform at the Empire Polo Fields in Indio, California this spring.
It's no secret that Coachella have veered more away from rock and metal in recent years in favor of a more pop-centric lineup, but this year's lineup does include one rock headliner in Green Day. This will be the band's first ever appearance at the long-running festival. They'll head up the Saturday festivities of both weekends.
