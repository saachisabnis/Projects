Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, logs a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. The song premiered at the summit two weeks earlier, becoming Post Malone’s sixth leader and Wallen’s second.

	Notably, while “I Had Some Help” is among 27 hits that have topped both the Hot 100 and the Hot Country Songs chart (which shares the former’s multimetric methodology), it’s the first to have debuted atop both tallies and spent its first three weeks on each at No. 1. Only one other song has led in even its first two weeks on each list: Oliver Anthony Music’s “Rich Men North of Richmond,” last August-September.

	Meanwhile, Zach Bryan bows on the Hot 100 at No. 6 with “Pink Skies.” The song arrives as the singer-songwriter’s third top 10 on the chart.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 8, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 4. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	Below is a rundown of the latest Hot 100’s top 10.

	“I Had Some Help,” on Mercury/Republic/Big Loud, notches a third week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, with 52.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 24%, good for the chart’s top Airplay Gainer award for a second week), 47.4 million official streams (down 14%) and 15,000 sold (down 25%) in the U.S. May 24-30.

	The collaboration drops to No. 2 on the Digital Song Sales chart after two weeks at No. 1; keeps at No. 2 after it debuted at No. 1 on Streaming Songs and jumps 9-5 on Radio Songs. On the lattermost list, it hits the top five in just its fourth week, wrapping the fastest rise to the region since Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” also needed only four frames to go top five in January-February 2023. It’s also the first song ever to reach the Radio Songs top five in as few as four weeks that has also hit the Country Airplay chart’s top five (dating to each chart’s 1990 inception). It bounds 8-4 on Country Airplay, while hitting the Adult Pop Airplay top 10 (13-10) and pushing 15-14 on Pop Airplay.

	Zach Bryan’s “Pink Skies” debuts at No. 6 on the Hot 100 with 31.6 million streams, 166,000 in radio reach and 10,000 sold. The track is expected to introduce his upcoming project, believed to be titled The Great American Bar Scene.

	The song arrives as Bryan’s third Hot 100 top 10, after “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, soared in atop the chart last September and “Something in the Orange” reached No. 10 in January 2023.

	“Pink Skies” concurrently debuts at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and  Hot Rock Songs charts, becoming Bryan’s third leader on each ranking; “I Remember Everything” totaled 30 weeks atop each tally and “Something in the Orange,” 20 each. On Hot Country Songs, “Pink Skies” opens at No. 3, marking Bryan’s 10th top 10.

	Think “pink”: “Pink Skies” is the fourth Hot 100 top 10 with “pink” in its title over the chart’s nearly 66-year history. Here’s a recap of the select songs to have colored the region:

	Plus, Pink Floyd (“Another Bring in the Wall”; No. 1 for four weeks in 1980), PinkPantheress (“Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2,” with Ice Spice; No. 3, 2023) and Frijid Pink (“House of the Rising Sun”; No. 7, 1970) have hit the Hot 100’s top 10 … along with P!nk, who boasts four No. 1s among 15 career top 10s.

	Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” holds at No. 2 on the Hot 100, three weeks after it debuted at No. 1. It posts a third week atop Streaming Songs (51.9 million, down 13%) and commands the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts for a fourth week each.

	Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” is steady at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2. It leads the multimetric Hot R&B Songs chart for a fifth week.

	Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” holds at No. 4 on the Hot 100, after rising to No. 3, as it rebounds for a second week atop Digital Song Sales (20,000 sold, up 1%), and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” lifts 6-5 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 4.

	Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March, repeats at No. 7, as it tops Radio Songs for an eighth week (69.3 million in audience, down 5%); Hozier’s “Too Sweet” ascends 9-8 on the Hot 100, following a week at No. 1 in April, as it leads the multimetric Hot Alternative Songs chart for a ninth week; Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” dips 8-9 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 2; and Billie Eilish’s “Lunch” falls to No. 10, a week after it debuted at No. 5.
