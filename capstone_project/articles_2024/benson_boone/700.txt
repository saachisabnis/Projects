Dua Lipa is headlining the Saturday night lineup at this year’s Austin City Limits Music Festival. In celebration of the occasion, the artist shared an Austin-themed photo dump on Instagram.
Featuring shots of Austin-area barbecue and a cowboy boot store, the gallery also includes numerous shots of Dua Lipa looking characteristically beautiful in a cowgirl chic look. Several provide a glimpse at the global pop superstar’s killer legs.
Other top-billed acts at ACL Fest Saturday include Pretty Lights, Renee Rapp, Khruangbin, Teddy Swims, and Benson Boone.
The new Instagram gallery follows.
