The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is updating their schedule. 
The NBC chat first will now air new episodes Mondays through Thursdays, with a repeat on Fridays, according to EW.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the shift is due in part to ever-changing viewer habits. 
The 49-year-old comedian took over The Tonight Show from Jay Leno following his retirement in 2014. He previously hosted Late Night with Jimmy Fallon from 2009 until 2014.

NBC renewed his contract in June for the show to air through 2028.
"For nearly 30 years, I’ve brought laughter into the homes of millions and charmed audiences from the stages of 30 Rock," he said in a statement at the time.
"It’s been a privilege to be at the helm of The Tonight Show, and I’m thrilled to see what innovations me and the incredible staff will deliver in the years to come at the network. No, I’m not changing my quote. Tell Mark to change his," he said, repeating NBC Universal's Mark Lazarus words.
