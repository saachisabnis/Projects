"Shut It Down!"
Rachel Zoe and husband Rodger Berman have called it quits.
The duo, whom met in 1991 while attending George Washington University, are divorcing after 26 years of marriage.
The 53-year-old fashion icon announced the news via Instagram on Sept. 9 (Monday).
"After 33 years together and 26 years married, Rodger and I have come to the mutual decision to end our marriage," she wrote. "We are incredibly proud of the loving family we have created and our countless memories together."
"Our number one priority has been and will always be our children. We are committed to coparent our boys and to continue to work together within the many businesses we share. We ask for privacy during this time as we navigate this new chapter," Zoe added.
The former flames wed in 1998, and share two sons: Skyler, 13, and Kaius, 11.
