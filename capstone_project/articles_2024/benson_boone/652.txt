“Are You Ready For It? A Taylor Experience" at the Timber Lake Playhouse -- November 2.
Saturday, November 2, 7 p.m.
Timber Lake Playhouse, 8215 Black Oak Road, Mt. Carroll IL
A Tribute Artist of the Year nominee at the Grand Ole Opry House's 10th-annual Josie Awards, Chicago's singing and dancing sensation Traci Marie brings her touring event Are You Ready For It? A Taylor Experience to Mt. Carroll's Timber Lake Playhouse on November 2, paying tribute to one of the most iconic pop stars of the 21st century with a live-band performance that recreates Taylor Swift's historic "The Eras Tour."
"The Eras Tour" is Swift's ongoing sixth concert tour that commenced on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver, consisting of 149 shows that span five continents. With a cultural and economic impact across the globe, "The Eras Tour" is the highest-grossing tour of all time, and the first tour in history to surpass $1 billion in U.S., revenue. Swift announced the tour in 2022, following the release of her 10th studio album Midnights, as her second all-stadium tour after the 2018 "Reputation Stadium Tour." Running more than three-and-a-half hours, the set list of "The Eras Tour" consists of more than 40 songs grouped into 10 distinct acts that portray all of Swift's studio albums conceptually; the show was revamped this past May to incorporate Swift's then-new 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department. The tour also featured 19 opening acts, two per concert, that have included Paramore, Phoebe Bridgers, Raye, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone, and Gracie Abrams.
The tour received praise from critics, who emphasized the concept, production, aesthetics and immersive ambience, as well as Swift's vocals, stage presence, and versatile showmanship. It recorded unprecedented public demand, ticket sales and attendances, bolstering economies, businesses, and tourism worldwide, dominating social media and news cycles, and garnering tributes and accolades from governments and organizations. Swift disclosed and released various works throughout the tour: the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version); editions of Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department; the music videos of "Karma," "I Can See You," and "I Can Do It with a Broken Heart"; and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film, documenting the Los Angeles shows, was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, in an uncommon distribution deal circumventing major film studios. Met with critical acclaim, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing concert film in history.
Channeling Swift in her Are You Ready For It? concert, Traci Marie, a small-town theatre girl from the suburbs of Chicago, grew up surrounded by musical talent. Throughout her career, she has opened for national touring artists including Tony Orlando, The Righteous Brothers, Chubby Checker, and others. She has performed with Felix Cavaliere of The Rascals, and Dennis Tufano of The Buckinghams fame, and this former “Miss Congeniality” winner was also nominated for Tribute Artist of the Year at the 2024 Josie Music Awards. Boasting choreography, stunning multimedia visuals, costume changes, and audience participation, her touring production features a live band paying tribute to the most successful tour in music history, and whether you’re a Swiftie or new to Taylor’s music, this fast-paced, energetic show promises to be a must-see event.
Traci Marie's Are You Ready For It? A Taylor Experience lands in Mt. Carroll on November 2, admission to the 7 p.m. concert event is $25-30, and more information and tickets are available by calling (815)244-2035 and visiting TimberLakePlayhouse.org.
