Benson Boone exited his Cincinnati show on Monday (September 30) wearing only a speedo as he waived goodbye to fans crowded outside The Icon Festival Stage following the epic event. 
The "Beautiful Things" hitmaker took over The Queen City as part of his most recent "Fireworks & Rollerblades World Tour" stop, stepping out in one very patriotic article of clothing paired with cowboy boots. 
The star also carried a large backpack and a notepad as he confidently descended the stairs, saluting fans on the way. Boone not only resounded his love for speedos, but also the crowd present at his Cincinnati show, posting a carousel of pics from the concert along with a caption exuding gratitude for his Ohio fans.  
"CINCINNATIüíõ one of the best crowds I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of hearing. Never change. I will remember last night for the rest of my lifeü´∂üèΩ"
The photo series in question features the star singing and dancing across the stage in a jumper with the word "Cincinnati" printed on the back. 
Just when you thought it couldn't get more legendary, the last video in the series shines a spotlight on the "Slow It Down" standout in his iconic speedo/cowboy boot combo living his best life. Boone is slated to take the stage at the Choctaw Grand Theater in Durant, Oklahoma, on Thursday (October 3) as part of his next "Fireworks & Rollerblades World Tour" stop.
