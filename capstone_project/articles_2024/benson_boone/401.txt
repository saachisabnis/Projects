The “Mamushi” rapper was announced as the host of the 2024 MTV VMAs. A promo for the ceremony promises that she’ll bring “thee heat,” “thee body,” and “thee savagery.”

This is Megan Thee Stallion’s first time hosting an awards show, but she has related prior experience: she previously hosted SNL and co-hosted The Tonight Show.
