It’s Tuesday, Boston.
☕ Some Swifties might look at this Taylor Swift fit and think it’s an Easter egg. But Massholes are only thinking one thing: Dunkin’.
👀What’s on tap today:

It’s high time we get to watch a Boston sports team win again. And luckily for us, the Celtics tip off their season today against the Knicks. 
Here’s what to know:
🏆 ICYMI: The C’s ended last season with a bang. And by bang, we mean they brought home their 18th banner, giving us a duck boat parade to remember. Let’s just say, it was well-earned: The team spent several seasons coming up just short and dealing with ample talking head chatter. But after entering last season with what many considered to be the NBA’s deepest roster, the C’s won the most regular season games (64-18) in the NBA and finished with an impressive 16-3 record in the playoffs. 
🔁 This year, they’re going for a two-peat. And it’s no pipe dream. All five starters, not to mention most of their bench, are back this season, and aside from Kristaps Porzingis, who’s recovering from an ankle injury, they’re all healthy knocks aggressively on wood. Sprinkle in a championship-quality preseason showing, and it’s no surprise many experts are betting the C’s will win it all again. That said, it likely won’t come easy. Other high-caliber teams have been beefing up their own rosters in anticipation.
☕ A solid roster ≠ no tea this season. While most of the Celtics’ players aren’t going anywhere, longtime team owners Wyc Grousbeck and family are in the process of selling their majority stake in the franchise, which might have something to do with the steep cost of maintaining its All-Star lineup. The bidding process is going to kick off soon, so we might see that pick up steam during the season. Though the sale wouldn’t likely cause any immediate changes, the rumor mill is always churning.
🏀 You can kick off the season in style at the “NBA on TNT American Express Roadshow,” which is hosting a truly impressive slew of (free!) themed programming from 4:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. at City Hall Plaza. It’ll include a live presentation of NBA Tip Off with Shaq, Charles Barkley, Ernie Johnson, and Kenny Smith, pre- and post-game concerts by Shaboozey and Benson Boone, and of course, a big, fat Celtics watch party. 
⭐  Prefer to relive last year’s glory? Take your pick: This new Netflix docuseries, “Starting Five,” follows Jayson Tatum (and four other NBA stars) throughout last season. Or, you can wait till spring 2025, when a documentary about the C’s run for banner 18 will reportedly air.

🎱 The outlook for this winter is … warm. We’re no fortune tellers: That’s straight from the NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, which recently dropped its winter weather outlook. Taking into account the decent probability that we’ll see a La Niña winter — a.k.a. a natural climate pattern that can impact snow, temps, and other precipitation — the center’s forecast for Mass. shows a 40-50% chance that we’ll get a warmer-than-average winter with average precipitation. That said, it’s still a little soon to say anything for sure.
🚲 Before you hop on an e-bike, read this: As e-bikes have become more popular and accessible, injury rates have skyrocketed, jumping up 293% nationally between 2019 and 2022, according to one database. Why? Top speeds of 30+ mph, added weight, poor safety infrastructure, and a lot of overly enthusiastic newbies, to name a few. And though 18-to-44-year-olds make up the bulk of those injuries, Gen Xers and Boomers are actually the fastest growing cohort of injured riders — local doctors say those are the folks they’re seeing and treating the most.
🤔 Are you a millennial with memory issues? It’s not just you. Apparently, there’s an entire medical conversation about the phenomenon. The amount of working age adults who say they have “serious difficulty” remembering, concentrating, and making decisions has seen its first measurable increase in over a decade. According to some experts, the culprit is likely our lifestyles, including poor diet and exercise, technology usage, and maybe most importantly, stress. Therefore, making holistic lifestyle changes to all of the above could sharpen our memory.
🥾 Noah Kahan stans, grab your credit cards. Today, the former Watertown resident and current music superstar is dropping another collection with L.L. Bean. As of Monday evening, the deets were still under wraps, but according to this sleuthy post by @noahkahannation on IG, the drops will likely include a cute jacket, some fancy-looking Bean boots, plus a tote bag and hat with Kahan’s name on them. The only bummer? If his last collection’s prices are any indication, you can expect to put a solid dent in your weekly “fun” budget.

When we say “tabloid celebrity,” Bill Belichick is not the first name that comes to mind. But ever since the former Pats coach got fired, made an IG, became a media personality, and started dating 24-year-old micro influencer Jordon Hudson, he’s getting his fair share of Us Weekly write-ups.
This time: Belichick and Hudson went to a Belichick-themed corn maze in Whitinsville. The maze was made to spell out “thanks Bill,” and “do your job” (his iconic coaching quote) in corn. 
If the idea was to give Belichick the wildest date idea ever, it worked. The duo took pictures in front of the maze, posted an IG collab with the creamery, and Belichick even signed a football for them from “Bill Belichick, 8x Super Bowl champion.”

🏈 Thanks for reading! In case you’re wondering, he’s including those extra two Super Bowl W’s as an assistant coach for the Giants. Savage.

📝 The results are in: 49% of B-Siders say that they’re leaning toward voting “no” on the MCAS ballot question with 43% leaning “yes” and 8% undecided. Teachers on both sides of the question wrote in to make their case. One said: “As a teacher, the MCAS is just not the best way to measure student progress, and kids with high needs DO struggle with it,” and another said: “Taking away the standard would be such a demotivator for students.”
