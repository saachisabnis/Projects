The 2024 MTV Video Music Awards performance lineup includes some of music’s biggest names. From pop singers to rock stars, the artists will take the stage on Wednesday, September 11, at New York’s UBS Arena. The original date of the show was Tuesday, September 10, but was moved in order to avoid conflicting with the upcoming presidential debate. Among those expected to perform is this year’s Video Vanguard Award recipient, Katy Perry.
The first round of performers was announced earlier this month. The initial announcement listed Sabrina Carpenter, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes — all three of whom are in a rumored love triangle after the release of Sabrina’s Short n’ Sweet album.
Below is a list of the confirmed performers at the 2024 VMAs.

The “Gasoline” artist will perform a new song from their upcoming album. Halsey recently released her single “Lucky” earlier this summer. In her music announcement, Halsey also revealed that she has been battling a secret illness and is “lucky to be alive.”
“Long story short, i’m Lucky to be alive [sic],” Halsey captioned an Instagram post in June. “Short story long, i wrote an album. it begins with The End. out now [sic].”
