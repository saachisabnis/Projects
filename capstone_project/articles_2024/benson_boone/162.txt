	“I just found out Fortnight is #1 on the UK airplay chart!!!!” the “Cruel Summer” artist, 34, said alongside an Eras Tour poster. “Thought this might be a fun time to announce the first group of opening acts I’ll be adding to the London shows, going on before Paramore. I chose artists whose music I love listening to, and I can’t wait for them to add an extra jolt of excitement to our shows.”
