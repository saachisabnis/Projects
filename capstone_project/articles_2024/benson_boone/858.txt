Taylor Swift is welcoming five new artists to her Eras Tour run: Raye, Suki Waterhouse, Maisie Peters, Holly Humberstone and Sofia Isella, each of whom will open for one of the pop star’s concerts at Wembley Stadium later this month. 

	Swift personally delivered the news on Instagram Stories Monday (Aug. 5). “Just wanted to tell you about something coming up that I’ve been so excited about: we’re adding 5 incredible artists to our 5 Wembley shows, going on right before @paramore!!” she wrote. “I asked them to play on this tour because I love their music and think they’ll absolutely smash it in Wembley Stadium!! Go check out their music if you haven’t already. Gonna be a fun 5 nights!!!” 

	










	Running Aug. 15-17, 19 and 20, the “Karma” singer’s upcoming stint at Wembley will come about two months after she first brought her Eras shows to the massive London venue for three nights in June. Mette, Griff and Benson Boone each opened for one of the performances, while Paramore has been a constant on the 14-time Grammy winner’s European leg.  

	Waterhouse, who is close friends with Swift and will perform on the 17th, also shared the news on X. “It feels like an honour to simply exist at the same time as @taylorswift, let alone be an opener for her on the biggest and best tour ever 😭😭” she wrote. “A dream come true that I never want to wake up from. Playing at wembley stadium in my hometown!!” 

	“The hardest secret I’ve ever had to keep,” tweeted Humberstone, who will play on the 16th. “As if I get to support Taylor at The Eras Tour !!!!!! pinch me !!!!! @taylorswift thank you thank you I am eternally grateful what an honour, I have no words & I can’t f–kin wait for the 16th !” 

	The announcement comes as Swift has just two stops left on her European leg, with three back-to-back shows in Vienna slated for Aug. 8-10 ahead of her Wembley finale. After that, she’ll swing back through the United States and Canada for one last leg before closing out the Eras Tour in December. 

	“That feels so far away from now, but then again, it feels like we just played our first show on this tour because you have made this so fun for us that we wanted to do 100 shows, 150-something shows that we have on the whole tour,” Swift said on stage during a show in June. “This tour has really become my entire life. It’s taken over everything. I think I once had hobbies, but I don’t know what they were anymore because all I do when I’m not onstage is sit at home and try to think of clever acoustic song mash-ups and think about what you might want to hear. So when I’m not on the stage, I’m dreaming of being back on the stage with you guys.”
