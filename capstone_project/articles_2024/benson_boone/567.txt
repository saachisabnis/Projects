Jenn Tran is bringing her love of Taylor Swift to the ballroom during Dancing With the Stars season 33.
The Tuesday, October 15, episode will honor the people and organizations that are near and dear to each contestant’s heart.
For Jenn, that’s the Eras Tour performer. Jenn and her partner, Sasha Farber, are slated to perform a foxtrot to the Lover track “The Archer.” The tune dives into fears of someone not being there for her — and was featured as one of the former Bachelorette’s Taylor Swift–themed songs of the week while season 21 of the reality show aired earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Team USA Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik is paying tribute to men’s gymnastics with an Argentine tango to “Seven Nation Army” by the White Stripes, and model Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko will dance a salsa to“Mi Gente” by J Balvin and Willy William, dedicated to her sisters.
The evening will also feature guest judge and former pro Mark Ballas, who recently took home the mirrorball trophy with his partner, Charli D’Amelio, during season 31. Judge Derek Hough and his wife, Hayley Erbert, will also perform a number to “Beautiful Things (Acoustic)” by Benson Boone, marking her first time back since undergoing emergency brain surgery.
Scroll down to see what song each couple will perform to and dedicate the number to:
