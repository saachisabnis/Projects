Living for this lineup! 
If last year’s MTV Video Music Awards were any indication, the beloved show is back for more iconic moments as it returns to New York. The 2024 VMAs are touching down at the UBS Arena on Wednesday, September 11, and we can’t wait to watch hot girl Megan Thee Stallion take on hosting duties for the night. Of course, this year’s ceremony is bringing on a ton of star-studded guests ~as per usual~, and some of the power pop players of the year are hitting the main stage (Chappell Roan and Cosmo cover girl Sabrina Carpenter, to name a few 👀).
So let’s catch you up to speed ahead of the show so you don’t miss a beat. Below, find all the performers taking the stage at the 2024 VMAs.
Jessie Murph is riding on the high of releasing her debut album That Ain’t No Man That’s the Devil as she takes the Extended Play stage at this year’s ceremony. She’s also in the running for her first two Moon Persons, including Best Collaboration with Jelly Roll. 
Teddy Swims is also making his VMAs debut on the Extended Play stage, performing his number one hit “Lose Control” and “The Door.” ICYMI, he also earned four VMA nods, including Best New Artist and Best Alternative.
The VMAs Pre-Show marks LE SSERAFIM’s first-ever U.S. awards show performance, and if their incredible Coachella performance is any indicator, we’re in for a total treat from the K-Pop superstars.
Meg is hosting the whole show *and* performing, after taking the stage with Cardi B for a performance of “Bongos” last year. The two-time winner is up for seven nods this year, including Best Hip Hop and Best Collaboration with her tourmate GloRilla.
VMA veteran Katy Perry is returning to the main stage for an epic performance as the recipient of the coveted Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. ICYMI, Katy hosted the show in 2017 and has rightfully racked up *plenty* of Moon People over the years.
After her instantly iconic mashup performance of “Feather” and “Nonsense” during last year’s Pre-Show, Sabrina is making her way to the VMA main stage as a first-time performer and nominee (!!!). The “Espresso” hitmaker is up for six Moon Person awards, including Artist of the Year and Song of the Year.
It’s Chappell Roan’s bedazzled campy world, and we’re just living in it—which is why she’s making her VMA debut this year! The first-time nominee is up for two categories, including Best New Artist.
GloRilla presented an award at last year’s show, but the five-time nominee is making her live performance debut this year. She’s nominated for three awards, including Best Hip-Hop and Best Collaboration for “Wanna Be” with tourmate and VMA host Megan Thee Stallion. 
Yep, the Real Slim Shady is opening up the 2024 VMAs with his first televised performance from his new album, The Death of Slim Shady. Eminem is up for eight Moon Person awards this year, and he last took the VMA stage for a performance in the Metaverse with Snoop Dogg in 2022. 
Benson Boone blew up with his track “Beautiful Things” earlier this year, and he’ll be bringing that same magic to the VMAs. The MTV PUSH artist and first-time nominee is nominated for three categories including Best New Artist and Best Alternative.
BLACKPINK’s “Pink Venom” performance at the 2022 VMAs still lives in our heads rent-free, and now, LISA is gracing the stage with new solo material. The multitalented idol won Best K-Pop for “Money” two years ago, and she’s up for Best K-Pop and Best Choreography at this year’s show.
Halsey hasn’t performed on the VMA stage since they sang “Closer” with The Chainsmokers in 2016, but they’re back to sing some newness from their upcoming album. In 2019, Halsey took home a Moon Person for Best K-Pop with BTS for their track “Boy With Luv.”
After the release of her album, C,XOXO, Camila Cabello is bringing her Miami heat to the VMAs for the first time since 2021, when she performed “Don’t Go Yet.” The four-time VMA winner is up for Best Pop at this year’s show.
Shawn Mendes is also returning to the VMA stage since he last performed “Summer of Love” with Tainy in 2021. The two-time nominee is giving his first televised performance of tracks from his new album, Shawn, at this year’s show.
La Bichota, Karol G, lit up the stage with a performance of “Oki Doki”/ “Tá Ok” during last year’s show, and she’s back for more this year as she’s up for the Best Latin award.
First-time VMA nominee Rauw Alejandro is one hell of a performer, and he’s gracing the MTV stage for a debut performance from his upcoming album. 
Third time’s the charm! Anitta is performing at the VMAs for the third year in a row with a medley of “Savage Funk” and “Alegria.” She’s also premiering her new track, “Paradise,” with guest appearances by Fat Joe, DJ Khaled, and Tiago PZK. 
Living legend Lenny Kravitz is performing at the VMAs for the first time in 25 years (!!!). He made his VMA debut in 1993 with a performance of “Are You Gonna Go My Way” and took home a Moon Person for Best Male Video that same year. The last time he performed at the awards show was alongside Madonna in 1998. 
After serving as an emcee at last year’s show (and performing in an epic 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop tribute), LL Cool J is debuting new music from his new album on the VMA stage.
