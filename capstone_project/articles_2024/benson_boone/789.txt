Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” tops the first Top Gabb Music Songs chart as the most-played song on Gabb Wireless phones during October 2024.

	As announced Nov. 14, Billboard has partnered with Gabb Wireless, a phone company for kids and teens, to present a monthly chart tracking on-demand streams via its Gabb Music platform. Gabb Music offers a vast catalog of songs, all of which are selected by the Gabb team to include only kid- and teen-appropriate content. Gabb Music streams are not currently factored into any other Billboard charts.

	










	Boone’s “Beautiful Things” leads the inaugural 25-position list, one of two songs from the pop singer-songwriter in the initial top 10. Released in early 2024, “Beautiful Things” peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March and ranks at No. 8 on the latest, Nov. 16-dated survey. It earned 82.7 million official U.S. streams on Billboard in October 2024, according to Luminate.

	Boone also appears in the top 10 of Top Gabb Music Songs via “Slow It Down,” at No. 9; it peaked at No. 32 on the Hot 100 in September.

	Country music is represented in Gabb’s top 10 by Luke Combs’ “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma,” at No. 2. Combs’ contribution to the Twisters: The Album soundtrack peaked at No. 13 on the Hot 100 in August and at No. 3 on the Hot Country Songs ranking in September.

	And at No. 3 comes the top hip-hop entry (as well as the newest release in the top 10, as the song arrived on Oct. 3): KSI’s “Thick of It,” featuring Trippie Redd. Known not just as a musician but also as a YouTube star, boasting nearly 25 million subscribers, KSI’s latest release reached No. 64 on the Hot 100 dated Oct. 26.

	Continuing a trend of genre variety, Hozier’s “Too Sweet” represents rock/alternative music in Top Gabb Music Songs’ top 10, at No. 4. It’s one of two songs in the top 10 to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 — alongside Sabrina Carpenter’s “Please Please Please,” at No. 8 — having ruled for a week in April.

	Then there’s NF, who charts the most appearances in the top 10 with three in all; “Let You Down,” from 2017’s Perception, leads the group at No. 5, followed by “Hope” at No. 7 (from his 2023 album of the same name) and “The Search” at No. 10 (the title track to his 2019 album).

	










	NF doesn’t stop there; the rapper also boasts the No. 13 song with “Motto,” giving him four total entries on the inaugural Top Gabb Music Songs chart. That’s the second-most of any act, behind Imagine Dragons, which has five, led by “Bones” at No. 16.

	Speaking of Imagine Dragons: “Radioactive” (No. 19) and “Demons” (No. 21), both from the band’s 2012 album Night Visions, are the oldest songs on the chart. The aforementioned “Thick of It” is the newest.
