It's officially that time again! 
The 2024 iHeartRadio 102.7 KIIS FM’s Jingle Ball Presented by Capital One is just a few months away, and we're announcing this year's Los Angeles lineup in a big way. 
Dasha and The Kid LAROI stopped by the iHeartRadio Theater in Burbank on Friday (September 27) to kick off the first-ever iHeartRadio Jingle Ball lineup announcement party, chatting with host JoJo Wright and performing a few of their most popular tracks. 
Dasha (slated to perform at this year's Dallas/Fort Worth Jingle Ball) was first to take the stage with "Austin (Boots Stop Workin')," and "Even Cowboys Cry," both featured on her second studio album, What Happens Now?, released earlier this year. 
Wright asked Dasha how her life has changed since releasing "Austin (Boots Stop Workin')," which went viral on social media in March 2024 and skyrocketed the artist to stardom. 
"I've been asked that question a lot and every time I feel dumb answering it, but literally everything [has changed]. I am so grateful. It's been crazy. Thank you guys, seriously."
The Kid LAROI (slated to perform at this year's Miami Jingle Ball) grabbed the spotlight with hit single "STAY," followed by 2024's "GIRLS," and "NIGHTS LIKE THIS," both featured on The First Time (DELUXE VERSION). The standout revealed that he loved performing live, and that he was definitely feeling the energy present at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball lineup announcement party. 
"Performing is one of my favorite parts about the job. I mean, there's not really many parts to the job is there? But I do I love performing live. I love seeing energy live. This is awesome." 
The show continued with the highly-anticipated reveal of this year's Los Angeles iHeartRadio Jingle Ball lineup featuring a star-studded roster including Tate McRae, Meghan Trainor, Kane Brown, Benson Boone, Madison Beer, Shaboozey, T-Pain, Paris Hilton, NCT Dream, and headliner, SZA! 
The one-of-a-kind show will be held at the Intuit Dome on Friday, December 6th. The 2024 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball tour will begin at the Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, on December 3rd, and continue throughout the month, wrapping up at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, on December 21st. 
Additional tour stops include Chicago, Detroit, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta. 
Presale tickets to the 2024 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball tour will be available to Capital One cardholders from October 1st through October 3rd. General ticket sales will begin on Friday, October 4th at 12:00 p.m. local time and will be available at iHeartRadio.com/JingleBall.
