HOLLYWOOD—It seems like it gets earlier and earlier each year. On Friday, November 8, the nominees for the 2025 Grammy Awards were announced and we have another record broken. Beyonce is now the most nominated artist in Grammy history with a total of 99 nominations.
She picked up 11 nominations this year including the Big Three, Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Yes, her country album “Cowboy Carter” could be the album that finally earns Beyonce her first Grammy for Album of the Year after being nominated for the big prize five times prior and never winning.
She will face some tough competition in that race as she goes up against Taylor Swift yet again for “The Tortured Poets Department”. Swift has won Album of the Year four times, more than any other artist in Grammy history. Followed behind Beyonce is Kendrick Lamar, Charlie xcx and Billie Eilish with seven nominations each. I feel like Kendrick is a frontrunner in that Record of the Year Grammy. He picked up two nominations for Record and Song of the Year for his ubiquitous hit “Not Like Us;” that diss track against rapper Drake.
Lamar has never won either of those categories so it could be a first and a welcome first for the critically acclaimed rapper. However, he’ll have to battle against Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ‘Em,” Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” The Beatles “Now and Then,” Charli xcx “360,” “Good Luck, Babe” from Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift and Post Malone for “Fortnight.” Speaking of Carpenter, she earned six nominations, as did Swift and Roan who is nominated for Best New Artist.
