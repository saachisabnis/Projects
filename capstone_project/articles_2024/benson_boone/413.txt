Farms in Cook County received $15,041,281 in taxpayer-funded subsidies in 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Of the 4,212 subsidies provided, the largest was for Food Export Association of the Midwest USA, which received $700,000 for the claim of "Market Access Program".
The smallest subsidy provided to a Cook County farmer was $1 to David L. Paulson.
There were 4,543 fewer subsidies than the year before, and the total value of the subsidies fell by $10,966,748.
Kimberly Amadeo of The Balance said farmer subsidies "help high-income corporations, not poor rural farmers. Most of the money goes toward large agribusinesses."
USDA data analyzed by the Cato Institute found that "farmers (on net) have derived almost 40% of their income directly from the U.S. government‚Äù in recent years.
The U.S. has provided farm subsidies since the Great Depression to assist farmers who weather price fluctuations and disasters to help maintain consistent farming across the country.
