The Chainsmokers have finally dropped their highly anticipated remix of Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things,” a track that has been teased during their live performances for months. This remix marks a nostalgic return to the duo’s remix roots and the indie sound that initially propelled them to fame. Back to a time when Hype Machine and Soundcloud ruled.
The Chainsmokers bring their dance-forward style to Boone’s poignant ballad, taking the emotional original, oiling it up, and giving it their signature electronic, consensual touch. As they embrace a throwback sound, format and platform — Soundcloud — one can’t help but recall the era when unofficial remixes ruled Hype Machine and The Chainsmokers were staples on the charts for their infectious takes on indie hits. Their return to form on Benson Boone’s hit is a very 2015-era move. They kept the heartfelt lyrics about love and vulnerability but added a club-friendly foundation that communicates the same message but lightens the emotional weight of Benson Boone’s melancholic crooning. 
Drew even tosses in a new verse of his own.
