Get real!  Sabrina Carpenter is NOT in the running to win Best Pop Vocal Album.  Pure delusion.  The album is NOT even out yet.
The Gooch is right. Sabrina could drop a completely forgettable album like Tate McRae. While the fatigue from too many placeholder veterans certainly opens the door for new blood, let’s see if Sabrina can seal the deal. Until finished product has been examined, let’s be mature adults and wait to judge on its merits.
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”

‘Espresso’ is bigger (and fresher) than ‘greedy’ and ‘Please Please Please’ is already about 500x bigger than ‘exes’. there is no comparison with Tate anymore. even if the album is forgettable, it comes out literally a week before the deadline
as a rule of thumb, posts which begin with ‘the gooch is right’, ‘gucci made a point here’ = nonsense
the doubts over Sabrina are so reminiscent of the doubts over Future Nostalgia to me, it’s blatantly unwillingness to accept that the most relevant popstars change frequently. Sabrina is top 3 for BPVA as a minimum
Why is Sabrina “Short n Sweet” still not added to prediction center yet for AOTY?
BPSP is between Ariana, Sabrina and Taylor (if “Cruel Summer” gets in). While BPVA is going to be between Billie and Sabrina. Ariana might be a dark horse in BPVA too. Overall, this is turning to be an exciting race in pop.
it comes out literally a week before the deadline
Which is not necessarily good. For a nomination? Of course, but when was the last time when an album released in the very end of the eligiblity period won?

Total coincistat. When was the last time a PVA contender was even released at the end of the period? Closest I can think of is folklore but that didn’t lose because of its release date lol.
I don't even have my lorazepam, I'm going to have to DRINK myself to sleep
2025 campaigns
Grammys: TBD

i don’t see how it would matter. she has scored two big hits months before the end of the eligibility period and the hits are what matter the most

Guts last year
Idk what Sabrina team is thinking but Espresso vs Pls Pls Pls is battling for the #1 on Billboard. Espresso has the physical that went out this week while Pls x3 has the streams (and is 2% away from the #1) of this week 🤭💀 this is crazy but I’m so happy for Sabrina 
carpenters, we got the inside scoop. #espresso is close to #1! U.S. fans, when’s the next time you’ll get a 69 cent espresso? take ur shot while u can https://t.co/ZCsmlACrLF pic.twitter.com/IopfMvOvz6

If Sabrina were a depressed girl with green hair, ugly clothes and looked like she didn’t shower in months Clownderby would call her the front runner instantly! God forbid anyone release fun pop music!  
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
If anything him being a racist probably helped his career, we all know exactly who was blasting Last Night last year
Oh nothing unites Americans more than racism without accountability. I can’t even say “White Anerica.” Latinos love Morgan Wallen.

Chappell is also now getting Hot to Go and Red Wine Supernova climbing up the charts. It has to be her for BNA. To say Benson Boone is frontrunner over her is wild. He has no buzz or critical success. His album only charted because of the one song being big at the time, similar to Shaboozey. Chappell is your favourite artist’s favourite artist. She’ll have the votes! But I think her only competition will be Shaboozey, not Benson. I’m counting Sabrina out, this is album number 6. Truly she must not be eligible. If she is though, it’s a shoo-in. 
I only said Benson bc don’t people have him getting pop and GF nominations? Unless you see Chappell getting a pop or GF nomination, which I don’t rn just bc the field is stacked
