Dave Matthews Band and Gwen Stefani top the intital the 2025 lineup of Lovin’ Life Music Fest. The three-day festival takes place in Charlotte, North Carolina, May 2 – 4.
Also on the initial Lovin’ Life 2025 lineup announcement is Benson Boone. The rising singer-songwriter released his debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblades, earlier this year.
“The last two years of my life, after writing music and releasing music, have happened so fast, and it’s so unexpected for me,” Boone stated. “I never really thought this would be what my life would look like two years ago. It’s taken off really fast, and it just reminds me of fireworks tied to rollerblades, like a rocket ship taking off.”
Boone joins veteran acts Dave Matthews Band and Gwen Stefani on the Lovin’ Life initial 2025 lineup announcement. The event website further detailed the festival:
