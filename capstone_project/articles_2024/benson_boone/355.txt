“Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t be exactly who you want to be”
Chappell Roan used her acceptance speech at the MTV VMAs 2024 to celebrate the queer and trans community. Watch below.
This year’s ceremony for the MTV Video Music Awards took place last night (September 11) at the UBS Arena in New York, hosted by Megan Thee Stallion.
Among the winners were Sabrina Carpenter who won Song Of The Year for ‘Espresso’, Katy Perry for VMA Most Iconic Performance, and Taylor Swift, who took home seven trophies. Check out the full winners list here.
Roan also won the career-defining award for Best New Artist, beating off competition from Benson Boone, Gracie Abrams, Shaboozey, Teddy Swims and Tyla. With the victory, she joins huge past recipients including Nirvana, Billie Eilish, Eminem and more.
While taking to the stage to accept the prize, she gave a moving speech to the audience, and dedicated the trophy to the “queer and trans people who fuel pop”.
“Can you believe it? We’re at the VMAs. I’m gonna read from here, I wrote a speech for my diary,” Roan began, going on to thank friends, family and her team for helping her in her career.

“I dedicate this to all the drag artists who inspire me, and I dedicate this to queer and trans people who fuel pop. To the gays who dedicate my songs to someone they love or hate,” she added.
“Thank you to the people who are fans, who listen to me, who hear me when I share my joy and fears. Thank you for listening.”
She continued: “And for all the queer kids in the Midwest watching right now, I see you. I understand you because I’m one of you. And don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t be exactly who you want to be, bitch.”
The award came shortly after Roan delivered her debut performance at the ceremony, showcasing her hit 2024 single ‘Good Luck, Babe!’ – which earned a nod in the Song Of The Summer list.
The theatrical performance began with the former NME Cover star walking through the gates of a mediaeval castle. Donning knight’s armour, she turned back and fired a burning arrow from a crossbow. She then played the upbeat track in front of the blazing set as a group of knights brandished swords while they danced around her.
Elsewhere at the MTV VMAs, Roan hit back at a photographer who seemingly told her to “shut the fuck up” on the red carpet.
Ahead of the ceremony, the rising artist faced some criticism after she confirmed that she would be cancelling two European shows due to “scheduling conflicts”. She later posted images of herself in rehearsals for the VMAs.
Roan released her debut studio album, ‘The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess’, last September to critical acclaim. In a four-star review, NME described it as “a display of Roan’s bold and brazen pen, where she places searing revelations alongside some deliciously cheeky choruses”.
Since then, she achieved her first UK Number One album almost a year after its release – something Elton John congratulated her on.
During her discussion with NME for The Cover in February, Roan reflected on her time moving to Los Angeles and first launching her career.
“I was told this city is demonic and Satanists live here,” she recalled. “But when I got to West Hollywood, it opened my eyes [to the fact] that everything I was afraid of wasn’t always true – especially [what I’d been told] about the queer community.
“Going to gay clubs for the first time, it felt spiritual […] I’d never even seen a drag queen before.”
