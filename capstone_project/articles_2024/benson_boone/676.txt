Itâ€™s the season of Noah Kahan right now on the Official Singles Chart, with the Vermont singer-songwriter dominating at Number 1 for a full month and securing this weekâ€™s highest new entry, too.Â Â 
Today, Stick Season stays strong for a fourth consecutive week at the summit, once again the most-streamed track in the country (8.7 million UK streams).Â 
Thereâ€™s more good news for Noah, as his brand-new Sam Fender duet Homesick debuts at Number 5. It becomes the second Top 10 hit in the UK for both artists in the process. Homesickâ€™s success also pushes Samâ€™s biggest hit to date, Seventeen Going Under, back into the Top 40 (32). It originally peaked at Number 3 in 2022.Â 
Itâ€™s tens across the board for Sophie Ellis-Bextor! Murder on the Dancefloor once again surges to a re-peak of Number 2, its original Official Singles Chart best from 2001, proving that Saltburn fever is far from over. Emerald Fennellâ€™s gothic thriller is up for several nods at this yearâ€™s BAFTAs â€“ including Best Supporting Actress for Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi for Best Supporting Actor.Â 
Now is the time to release your inhibitions and feel the rain on your skin â€“ Natasha Bedingfieldâ€™s Unwritten also rides the nostalgia wave, rising five to Number 13. The 2004 pop classic catches a second wind thanks to its inclusion in new rom com Anyone But You. Could it re-enter the Top 10 next week? Read more in our exclusive interview with Natasha Bedingfield on Unwrittenâ€™s chart resurgence here.Â 
Further down, Flo Milli hits a new peak with Never Lose Me (17), while TikTok star Benson Boone claims his first UK Top 20 single with Beautiful Things, a brand-new entry this week (18).Â Â 
Ella Henderson and Rudimentalâ€™s Alibi jumps up 20 places, breaking into the Top 40 (26), Chris Brownâ€™s Angel Numbers / Ten Toes reaches a new high (31), as does Songerâ€™s breakthrough hit Toxic (32).Â Â 
Becky Hill & Sonny Foderaâ€™s Never Be Alone is another new entry today (34). It becomes Beckyâ€™s 19th and Sonnyâ€™s second overall Top 40 entry.Â 
US viral sensation David Kushner earns a second Top 40 hit with Skin and Bones (36). It follows Daylight, which climbed all the way to Number 2 last year.Â Â 
And, finally, KygoÂ  and Ava Max team up for brand-new track Whatever, which crashes in at Number 38. Interpolating Shakiraâ€™s iconic breakthrough 2001 track Wherever, Whenever, Whatever becomes Kygoâ€™s 10th and Avaâ€™s sixth Top 40 entry (and first in nearly three years).Â

'Murder On The Dancefloor' back up to its all-time peak again is definitely the highlight for me. Hopefully it can get to #1 before it's back on ACR.Â 
Good to see 'Seventeen Going Under' make a return to the Top 40!Â ðŸ˜Š
