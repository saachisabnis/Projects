 MTV's Video Music Awards are back and as chaotic as ever. In addition to being the epicenter of the most unhinged pop culture moments, the ceremony has also historically served as a stage for music's biggest couples to debut their hot new relationships or showcase their everlasting love. It witnessed the hard launch of Ariana Grande and Mac Miller's relationship in 2016; the most meme-able redcarpet appearance from Noah Cyrus and Lil Xan in 2018; the first of several Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian makeout sessions; and many a date night for Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

 This year's show was a love fest for the ages. The lavish, star-studded evening saw everyone from Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom sharing a kiss to Margaret Qualley and Jack Antonoff sharing a laugh, among plenty more sweet, sexy, and swoon-worthy moments.

 It's a woman's world, and Bloom is living in it. The actor supported the singer on the black carpet, walking hand-in-hand, planting a sweet kiss on her lips, and introducing her performance with the cutest speech.

 "You fell in love with her as Katy Perry. I fell in love with her as Katheryn Hudson," he said before Perry took the stage to perform a mash-up of her most iconic songs. "She loves with her whole heart and it’s kind of irresistible," he continued.

 It's not the VMAs without some PDA. Good thing the "Beautiful Things" singer and his long-time girlfriend were in attendance. They heated up the black carpet by sharing a steamy smooch.

 Travis Kelce may have had to miss the awards ceremony but he was certainly there in spirit. When accepting the Video of the Year award for her and Post Malone's music video for "Fortnight," Taylor Swift gave her man the sweetest shoutout.

 “Something that I’ll always remember is when I would finish a take and I’d say cut and we’d be done with that take, I would always just hear someone cheering ‘woo’ from across the studio where we were shooting it, and that one person was my boyfriend, Travis," Swift said which caused the audience to erupt in cheers. “Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic, so I wanna thank him for adding that to our shoot because I’ll always remember that.”

 Kelce even threw out a "like" on MTV's post of Swift's speech, showing his support from afar.
