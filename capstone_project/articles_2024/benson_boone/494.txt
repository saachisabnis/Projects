Update your DVRs! The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is being scaled down to only four nights a week.
The NBC chat fest will now air new episodes Mondays through Thursdays, with a repeat viewing on Fridays, according to Entertainment Weekly.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the shift is due in part to ever-changing television viewer habits. 
Jimmy Fallon took over The Tonight Show from Jay Leno following Leno's retirement in 2014. 
Fallon previously hosted Late Night With Jimmy Fallon from 2009 until 2014.

In June, NBC renewed the Saturday Night Live alum's contract for the show to air through 2028.
"For nearly 30 years, I’ve brought laughter into the homes of millions and charmed audiences from the stages of 30 Rock," Fallon said in a statement regarding the renewal.
"It’s been a privilege to be at the helm of The Tonight Show, and I’m thrilled to see what innovations me and the incredible staff will deliver in the years to come at the network. No, I’m not changing my quote. Tell Mark to change his," he said, jokingly repeating NBC Universal's Mark Lazarus' words.
