A Michigan mom shared an open moment with her TikTok viewers as she posted a video comparing her reactions to the "gender reveals" during her first and second pregnancies.
Autumn Freeman experienced strong emotions on both occasions, but her reactions were completely different.
Autumn didn't hide her initial reaction when pink streamers flew instead of blue. She supports other mothers to embrace and share their experiences of disappointment with "gender reveal" events.
A TikTok video has ignited a lively online discussion, bringing light on societal opinions regarding expectations for parents and the lasting impact of our online presence.
A trending video, with an impressive 570,000 likes and 11 million views, shows the excitement of Autumn, a TikToker from Michigan, as she celebrates the upcoming birth of her second child.
However, the situation becomes more serious as pink confetti appears once again, indicating the arrival of another daughter. Autumn's obvious disappointment appears as she shares her longing for a son, expressing her momentary sadness before accepting the joy of welcoming another girl into the family.
Reflecting on the video, Autumn Freeman shares with PEOPLE her initial disappointment, caused by wanting to experience raising a son.
However, she shows her growing excitement for raising her two daughters, recognizing the short-term impact of her letdown and embracing her identity as a mother to girls, according to People.
"I'm actually sad," she told her husband, Andy.
"I wanted a boy," she added.
Before Autumn walk away, Andy said, "It's okay. Shell be just as beautiful as the rest."
"In my perfect world I'd have one boy and one girl," she says. "I actually wanted a boy with Violet, but it was my first one and I was just excited either way...Then with this one, we know it's our last baby."

"There's a bunch of haters in my comments that are like, 'You don't even love this baby. You don't deserve this baby,' " she says.
"That's not the case at all. It had nothing to do with how I feel about the baby or how much I love it or how much it's going to be loved. It was just a brief moment, and now it's gone. I'm ready for my girl."
However, not everyone has praised Autumn Freeman's reaction.
Some individuals share worries about the potential long-term effects of her decision to publicly share personal moments. They worry that her daughter may come across her mother's initial disappointment in the future.
The ongoing discussions surrounding privacy and the long-lasting nature of digital content have led to discussions about the potential effects of parents sharing too much online and how it might influence their children's self-perception in the future.
In spite of the critique, Autumn Freeman is short by her choice to share the video, insisting that her short discontent does not diminish her deep feelings for her unborn child. She shows the value of putting temporary emotions within the bigger picture of parents' love and excitement.
Autumn Freeman's experience offers perspective into the societal expectations surrounding gender preferences in parenting. Despite advances made in hard expectations from society, constant pressure to adhere to traditional family dynamics can lead to a sense of disappointment when reality doesn't meet expectations.
Along with her own daughter, Autumn Freeman also takes on the role of stepmother to her husband's two children from a previous relationship, including an extra layer of difficulty to the relationship between parenting and family expectations.
