The Global Citizen Festival is returning to New York City's Central Park on Saturday, September 28th, and will once again host a lineup of superstars on the Great Lawn.
This year's Global Citizen Festival includes performances from Post Malone, Doja Cat, LISA, Jelly Roll, Benson Boone, RAYE, Rauw Alejandro and more, and is hosted by Hugh Jackman with appearances from Coldplay's Chris Martin, Jane Goodall and others.
Fans can tune in to stream this year's Global Citizen Festival live on September 28th via iHeartRadio stations across the country, as well as on iHeartRadio's Global Citizen Radio station on the free iHeartRadio app. Global Citizen's official YouTube and Facebook channels will also be streaming the event.
Global Citizen's mission is to achieve the end of extreme poverty, rallying around critical issues including climate change, poverty, and inequality. This year, for the first time, the festival is diving in further to its existing sustainability efforts and is switching to battery power as the Central Park stage will be completely powered by the same SmartGrid battery system used to power Coldplay's "Music of the Spheres" tour.
In a statement, Global Citizen Festival performer Benson Boone explained of being a part of this year's festivities, "Ending extreme poverty is a responsibility we all share. I'm grateful to be involved in Global Citizen's mission by helping those who are living in extreme poverty. I hope we can all come together to take action and make a real difference in the world."
Tune in on September 28th!
