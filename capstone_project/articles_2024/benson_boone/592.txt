Apple says its Shazam app has now officially surpassed over 100 billion song recognitions since it launched. To help put that into perspective:
Shazam launched in 2002 as an SMS service in the UK, and back then, music fans would dial 2580, hold up their phones to identify music, and receive the song name and artist via text message. Shazam’s following and influence continued to grow in the years that followed, but it was the 2008 debut of the App Store and introduction of Shazam’s iOS app that brought its music recognition technology to millions of users, says Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. By the summer of 2011, Shazam had already recognized over one billion songs.
It’s available as a standalone app and as a built-in feature on the iPhone and iPad.
