Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert tugged at everyone’s heartstrings with their emotional performance during Dancing With the Stars’ Dedication Night.
Hough, 39, and Erbert, 30, who have been married since August 2023, danced to Benson Boone’s song “Beautiful Things” together during the Tuesday, October 15, episode. The routine marked Erbert’s first time back in the ballroom since she underwent emergency brain surgery for a cranial hematoma in December 2023.
“I just remember laying on the hospital floor and just begging” for her to stay alive, Hough told the cameras. When Erbert woke up, she asked “what happened” and remembered being on tour.
“Knowing that she was there, she was in there, the relief I felt,” Hough said, noting that his wife was back. However, he admitted that the recovery process was “hard,” calling Erbert his “beautiful miracle.” (Following the performance, Hough recalled the doctors telling him that Erbert was “a miracle.”)
Erbert eventually joined Hough onscreen and recalled being told that she may never walk again. However, being as “stubborn” as she is, the dancer said she was “determined to push myself to the limit.”
“I will be forver greateful to everyone who supported me through this,” she added. “It’s why I am here today.”
Following the emotional performance, Erbert opened up about the difficult journey of recovery.
“This was the most challenging thing I’ve ever been through in my life both physically and mentally and it’s been really difficult on us as a family,” she shared. “And you just never know what you’re capable of until you go through something this so I’m really proud of myself and my body and how I came through this.”
In a video played before the emotional routine, Hough got choked up while recalling the moment when Erbert started “having full seizures and essentially dying” backstage at his Symphony of Dance Tour in December 2023. She was then rushed to the hospital, where doctors told Hough they had to operate immediately.
“It’s really hard to even put into words other than just pure fear,” Hough said. “The doctor said that, ‘She might not make it and even if she does make it, she won’t be the same person.’”
Despite the doctor’s comments, the surgery went well, and Erbert announced that she would be returning to the tour after just four months of recovery.
“What a blessing (and surprise) it is to be able to be back on stage dancing with my love after such a crazy past four months. My healing journey has been nothing short of extraordinary and being able to dance again is igniting my soul in all the ways; speeding up my recovery even more,” she wrote via Instagram in April.
Hough praised his wife’s resilience and strong spirit while wishing her a happy 30th birthday on Friday, October 11.
“You are my miracle. Through every challenge, your strength and grace have been nothing short of inspiring. You’ve given me purpose, and you’ve changed my life in ways I never thought possible,” he wrote via Instagram. “We’ve been through so much together, and there’s no one else I’d want to share it all with.”

Erbert also commemorated the occasion and thanked her husband for making the day special.
“I have to give the biggest shoutout to my amazing husband for making this the best birthday I could’ve ever imagined,” she captioned several Instagram photos of the pair. “He surprised me with a trip to a place I have dreamt of visiting since before I can remember, during a time that is extremely busy for the two of us. But he made it a priority and I feel so dang special. I love you @derekhough so freaking much! ♥️♥️.”
