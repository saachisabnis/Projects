Every week, Billboard unveils the top 10 songs on the latest Hot 100 chart. The most recent rankings, for the chart dated February 10, are out now, so let’s run down who had this week’s biggest hits.
“Snooze” was released as a single back in April 2023, and it’s had an impressive chart run. It’s just barely hanging onto the top 10 now after dipping from No. 9 last week.
Savage did the ol’ switcheroo with SZA’s hit single, leaping from No. 10 to No. 9, two weeks after debuting in the No. 5 spot.
TikTok really is helping form the future of music: Boone gained popularity on the platform and now he has his first top-10 single with “Beautiful Things” which debuted on the chart at No. 15 last week.
Doja’s “Agora Hills” is hanging strong, matching its previous high at No. 7 this week. Now, about that face tattoo…
Bryan and Musgraves’ hit continues to dominate the charts: Aside from No. 6 on the Hot 100, it’s No. 1 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, the Hot Rock Songs chart (for the 23rd week for both), and the Hot Country Songs chart (19 weeks).
A lot of songs have been sticking around the top 10 for weeks now, and that includes “Greedy,” which remains just a few spots off its previous high at No. 3.
Like Boone, Swims recently landed his first top-10 single. “Lose Control” reached a new high of No. 4 last week, and that’s where it remains this frame.
“Cruel Summer” continues to dominate, but get ready for a new crop of Swift songs to charge up the Hot 100 soon.
Harlow had four weeks at No. 1 with “Lovin On Me,” including a chart-topping stint last week. Now, though, we have a new Hot 100 champion.
Megan is No. 1 with her new single “Hiss,” which is bound to upset a number of people, as the diss track goes after some of her fellow artists. “Hiss” is Meg’s third chart topper, following “Savage” and “WAP,” with “Hiss” being Meg’s first solo No. 1.
