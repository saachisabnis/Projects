Lollapaloozas contribution to the City of Chicago leads all festivals in the region. While the festival takes place over a four-day weekend in the summer, organizers strive to deliver meaningful engagement programs and create positive impacts in the city year-round. Lollapalooza works to support the local community in various areas, with a focus on introducing Chicago youth to creative opportunities in the festival industry and reducing barriers to arts access in Chicago schools. Reaffirming this commitment, organizers created the Lollapalooza Arts Education Fund, a $2.2M donation to support arts and education in Chicago Public Schools. In addition, Lollapalooza partners with local nonprofits including Community Goods and Yollocalli to integrate art by Chicago youth into the festival, hosts the annual Lollapalooza and Sueños Festival Job Fair to increase access to careers in the festival industry, and engages with the Chicago arts and culture community year-round through ongoing partnerships with the African American Heritage Festivals, Teens in the Park Fest, Black Culture Fest, and Musically Fed. As a part of Lollapaloozas commitment to community relations, the festival has also improved communal spaces by funding the Grant Park Tennis and Pickleball Court Project.

Lollapalooza has elevated its commitment to protecting the planet through a new global partnership with Re:wild, a nonprofit that has protected more than 400 million acres of wild lands around the world, benefitting more than 30,000 species. Lollapalooza is supporting Re:wild and its local partners by providing festival space for them to speak directly with music fans, and financially supporting Re:wild projects at Lolla festivals around the world. Because one of the most effective actions individuals can take to protect wildlife is eating a plant-based diet, Re:wild is working with Lollapalooza Chicago to offer more of these options at this years festival, and will have an activation onsite to interact with music fans.
