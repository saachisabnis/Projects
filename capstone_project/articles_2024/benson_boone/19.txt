It may still be possible to bag yourself via official resale sites. Visit Ticketmaster and AXS for more information.
However, Swifties should approach reseller sites such as Viagogo with caution - here's everything you need to know if you're on the hunt for Eras Tour tickets.
While tickets may have long sold out for the Eras Tour UK dates, sites such as Viagogo allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. At the time of writing, the site had hundreds of Taylor Swift tickets up for grabs spanning all 15 dates - but they don't come cheap, with prices starting upwards of Â£300 for a seat at a London show.
However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience.
Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk. With that said, Viagogo also commented: "Viagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the guarantee."
Viagogo's ticket guarantee states: "When You purchase tickets on Viagogo, Viagogo guarantees that you will receive the tickets you paid for in time for the event. In the rare instance that a problem arises and the original ticket seller does not provide you with the tickets listed for sale, Viagogo will, in its discretion, review comparably priced tickets and offer you replacement tickets at no additional cost, or Viagogo will issue you a refund for the cost of the tickets."
It continues: "'Comparably priced' replacement tickets are determined by Viagogo in its discretion. When you sell tickets on Viagogo, provided you provide the exact tickets listed for sale and the ticket buyer successfully gains entry to the event, viagogo guarantees that you will be paid for your sale."
In addition, Taylor Swift's official retailers, Ticketmaster and AXS, have released a statement asserting that any tickets acquired from non-authorised sellers will be invalid. They said: "The only way to obtain a valid ticket for Taylor Swift's shows is via the approved ticket agents. In the UK, the approved ticket agents are Ticketmaster, AXS or directly through the venue's website. In Ireland, the approved ticket agent is Ticketmaster. Any tickets found to be purchased via re-sale on the non-official secondary market will not be valid for entry into the concerts and will be cancelled in accordance with the terms and conditions of sale.
"Through official resale facilities, ticket resale prices are capped to help combat the inflation of ticket prices and put a stop to ticket touting. For more information on official resale facilities, fans should visit the website of their approved ticket agent. These resale facilities enable fans to sell their tickets with confidence and empower fans to purchase resale tickets with the assurance that the ticket they are purchasing is genuine."
