They chose a moody palette of blue and teal for the celebration.

 In the fall of 2018, after he finished graduate school in London and moved back to Boston, Ryan Cameron met Aaron Wood—a college senior at the time—on a dating app. Ryan took Aaron to his favorite pizza spot on their first date, and the pair spent the afternoon roaming the city streets looking at old buildings. “It sparked a mutual love for food and architecture that we continue to feed today,” Ryan says. In September 2021, Ryan proposed to Aaron on the beach in Cape Cod. “I remember not wanting him to see the outline of the ring box, so I kept my hands buried in my pockets the whole time, grasping the engagement ring until my fingers turned white,” Ryan says.

 The couple knew from the jump that they wanted to plan a wedding in Cape Cod. "It has always been our happy place," they say. "It’s where we started dating, where we got engaged, and where we’ve created some of our happiest memories together. We felt it was only right that we were married in this place that brings us so much joy." The easiest decision for them throughout the planning process was choosing Wequassett Resort & Golf Club, in Harwich, Massachusetts, as their venue. “The property is truly stunning, and the view is unbeatable,” Ryan says. “The whole setting really just blew us away.”

 They invited 150 guests to join them at Ryan’s parents house for a welcome party, which was followed by their September 16, 2023, wedding on Pleasant Bay. With a coastal chic theme in mind, their planner Kristyn Kerkorian of K. Kerkorian Events, designed their wedding with a moody teal and blue color scheme that subtly spoke to the event's timing on the border of summer and fall.

 Ryan and Aaron invited guests to a welcome party the day before their wedding, which was hosted at Ryan's parents' home, where the duo became engaged. For the celebration, Ryan wore a Rag & Bone dragonfly print shirt paired with blue chinos and Todd Snyder suede loafers. Aaron dressed in a custom olive linen suit with a cashmere crewneck from Suitsupply; he accessorized with gray suede Allen Edmonds loafers.

 Ryan and Aaron asked their guests to dress in "Cape Cod casual" attire for their pre-wedding party. “Our wedding planner and floral designer curated a colorful display of lush, tropical-themed florals and décor to go along with our 'Island Time' theme,” Ryan says. They hired a local steel drum band and even commissioned a custom wedding flag, which they held onto as a keepsake.

 Hurricane Lee was headed their way in the days leading up to the wedding weekend, so when the clouds cleared after a day of rain to reveal a vibrant sunset, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.  “One minute all of our guests were hanging out under the tent enjoying themselves and, the next thing we know, the tent had cleared out and everyone was gathered in the backyard cheering and taking photos,” Ryan says. “It was incredibly special.”

 For their big-day suits, Ryan and Aaron knew what they wanted in terms of color, fit, and fabric. Ryan wore a custom coastal blue linen blend suit, while Aaron wore a custom linen blend iteration in a sand tone; both were created by Chris Cuozzo. “Selecting our suit colors was probably the first decision we made after getting engaged and we never second guessed it,” Ryan says.

 They wore matching Gucci brown leather loafers and accessorized with Movado watches. “Aaron had given me the watch as a wedding gift and he knocked it out of the park,” says Ryan, who added a special touch to his attire with a seersucker pocket square (it was made from a suit his late brother used to wear).

 The duo shared their first look with their dog and took the opportunity to exchange personalized vows in private. “It gave us a chance to slow down and just be together for a moment before standing up in front of our closest family and friends and saying I do,” Ryan explains.

 The couple’s ceremony took place on the lawn at Wequassett Resort & Golf Club. A a grounded floral arch in shades of blue defined the natural altar and was thoughtfully positioned in front to give guests direct views of the ocean. Along with arrangements placed down the aisle, the couple’s florist, Jimmy from JNG Event Consulting, also created a stretch of lush florals that wrapped around the last row of chairs. Their planner later brought those arrangements into the reception space to dress up the stage.

 A string trio strummed out "Unchained Melody" as both grooms walked down the aisle accompanied by their mothers. Since the duo had already exchanged personalized vows ahead of the ceremony, their officiant walked them through promises he'd written just for them. Once they were officially married, the now-husbands celebrated back down the aisle to a string version of Taylor Swift’s “Wildest Dreams.”

 During the cocktail hour, guests took in ocean views from the venue’s terrace as they enjoyed the couple’s signature drink: a sea breeze. They were served passed appetizers, including tuna tartare cups, miniature lobster rolls, pork fried dumplings, and miniature crab cakes, during the interlude.

 The group moved into the venue’s grand pavilion for the reception. “The concept that Kristyn and Jimmy came up with for the reception décor was absolutely stunning,” Ryan says. “I remember us walking into the reception area for the reveal and we both literally gasped—we were in complete awe.”

 All tables in the space were topped with teal linens. At the head station, a floral and greenery arch provided a pop of drama; centerpieces consisted of meadow-like arrangements of flowers and candles. Guests were seated around the wedding party at round tables with low, lush arrangements interspersed with taper and votive candles.

 Ryan and Aaron shared their first dance to “Before You” by Benson Boone before Ryan danced with his mom to “Everything” by Michael Buble, and Aaron swayed with his mom to “Fly Me to the Moon” by Frank Sinatra.

 While they watched these dances, attendees enjoyed a raw bar and lobster bisque to start. For the main course, they had their pick of filet of beef with red wine demi, a pan-seared seabass with tomato vinaigrette, and a grilled eggplant dish with a walnut pecan crumble.

 The pair's two-tier chocolate wedding cake was covered in white buttercream frosting and topped with blue thistle and a custom golden retriever cake topper, as a nod to their pup. They held a private ceremonial cake cutting and brought out a cupcake station for their guests, complete with sweets in assorted flavors, fillings, and frostings.

 The couple spent the rest of the evening on the dance floor. "For entertainment, we chose to have a live band, Night Shift with Night Shift Entertainment," they say. "They were the most talented, high-energy wedding band we’d ever seen. They truly made the entire event."

 To couples planning their own weddings, Ryan and Aaron recommend building in private moments for the two of you. “We can both say without hesitation that our wedding weekend was the single most fun and enjoyable weekend of our lives, and we would do it all over again in a heartbeat," they say.
