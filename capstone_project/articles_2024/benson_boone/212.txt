Today marks TWO months at Number 1 for Beyoncé! She's held on to the top spot for another week running, with Teddy Swims and Benson Boone missing out, in at Number Two and Three respectively. 
Beyoncé is this week's Number 1 once again, with her country track 'TEXAS HOLD 'EM', on The Official Big Top 40.
There's no stopping Queen Bey; this week sees her new entries, 'YA YA' and 'BODYGUARD', join 'BLACKBIIRD', 'II MOST WANTED' and 'JOLENE' in the Top 20!
