During Lana Del Rey’s headlining set at Hangout Fest on Friday night, the pop superstar brought out Jelly Roll to duet with her on a rollicking cover of the Lynyrd Skynyrd classic, “Sweet Home Alabama,” to close out her show. Playing in front of an adoring audience in Gulf Shores, Alabama, Del Rey also took the stage to the Skynyrd tune, “Simple Man,” further endearing her to the receptive Bama crowd. Del Rey and Jelly Roll were clearly having a great time singing together, even as they took liberties with some of the southern anthem’s controversial lyrics. 
In addition to Jelly Roll, Del Rey’s set was filled with an array of special guests, with Canadian rapper Tommy Genesis joining LDR on “Peppers,” Benson Boone singing with Lana on his pop hit, “Beautiful Things,” and Nessa Barrett dueting with Lana on Barrett’s breakout single, “American Jesus.” (Consequence of Sound)
