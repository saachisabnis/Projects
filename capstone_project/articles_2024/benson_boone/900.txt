If you’re on TikTok, chances are you’ve encountered the viral sensation Benson Boone on your “for you page,” whether it’s him doing a backflip while singing, serenading at his piano, or “accidentally” leaking his songs before they release. 
Fresh off the release of his debut album “Fireworks & Rollerblades” on April 5th and commencing a 40-stop sold-out world tour, Boone took the stage at House of Blues on April 12, demonstrating why he’s emerging as a rising star.
Throughout his 17-song setlist, Boone engaged the crowd for nearly two hours, leading sing-along choruses and chatting with a diverse audience of young girls, their parents, and couples alike.
The night kicked off with guest performer Mimi Webb, born Amelia Webb, showcasing her TikTok chart-toppers “Good Without” and “Red Flags.” The British pop star set the tone with “Freezing,” a dance anthem that captivated the crowd, prompting them to sway with their phone lights in the air.
Webb utilized the power of TikTok to kickstart her music career, achieving her first breakthrough back in 2020 with songs like “Before I Go” and “I’ll Break My Heart Again.” Her music resonated with many young listeners worldwide, including those who also adore Boone.
“What’s up, Boston?” Boone’s voice, attempting a Boston accent, echoed through the House of Blues as he took the stage, prompting shrieks from the audience. He started his set at the piano, playing the introduction to his debut album, “Intro.”
Throughout his set, Boone entertained the audience with his striking range of vocals, from the soulful notes of his ballad “Drunk In My Mind” to the familiar strains of his American Idol hit “In The Stars.” Boone has seen his popularity soar since he departed from Season 19 of American Idol, rising to fame through his internet presence. He chose to leave the show to pursue music through social media.
Following his exit, Boone started sharing music snippets on TikTok and Instagram, rapidly amassing over 7 million followers collectively across both platforms. In late July 2022, Boone dropped his first EP, “Walk Me Home,” which featured his debut single, “Ghost Town,” charting in 13 countries, including the Billboard Hot 100, alongside his viral hit “In The Stars.”
One highlight of the show I was eagerly anticipating was Boone’s backflips, and he delivered, seamlessly integrating them into his performance multiple times throughout the evening. 
Boone also comedically interacted with the crowd, teasing a pair of friends in a lighthearted moment. “She’s all about friendship, but you’re aiming for something more,” he laughed, scanning the audience. “There’s always one of those — we call it a situationship.” 
With a smirk, he added, “Best of luck to you, sir.” Transitioning smoothly, he introduced his love song, “Forever and a Day.” While most of his songs may sound somewhat similar when streaming, it’s during his live performances where Boone truly sets each song apart. 
With a three-piece band accompanying him, the night took a turn during “Cry.” Just 20 seconds into the song, the house lights went out, the crowd gasped, and Boone smoothly transitioned from the piano to the stand microphone, the electric guitar breaking the silence of what once was the piano blaring through the house speakers. The audience fell for the unexpected twist, their shocked faces visible across the room. 
What makes Boone so captivating to watch is his genuine enjoyment on stage, paired with his unreserved display of emotions. He moves around, strumming his air guitar, singing with remarkable control, and always engaging with the crowd. Whether nodding, smiling, or sporting decorative cowboy hats from fans, he keeps the audience hooked, eager to see what he’ll do next.
As Boone performed his popular hits, he also surprised the crowd with something new. Right in the middle of his set, Boone introduced an unreleased song titled “Pretty Slowly,” boldly declaring it his “favorite song he’s ever written.” The heartfelt pop song captures the essence of discovering a place to call home. As the lights dimmed and he stood alone with just the microphone, the atmosphere shifted as he began to sing “Slow it Down,” a fan favorite and arguably the night’s best performance.  
Boone began the song at the piano, bathed in a solitary spotlight. As the chorus kicked in, he rose from the bench, and the stage lights burst to life behind him, with the band joining in from the top of the stage. Instantly, the mood shifted, and the crowd couldn’t resist dancing and singing along to the lyrics. As the song climbs the charts, thanks to its popularity on TikTok, it’s evident that fans are captivated by its message. It was as if we were all living in the present, caught up in the magic of the moment, with Boone seemingly able to slow down time itself during the performance.
Even though Boone’s album had only been out a week before the show, he was confident the audience would be intimately familiar with his well-loved songs. Before launching into the encore of his most well-known track, “Beautiful Things,” which has over 500 million streams, Boone addressed the crowd, saying, “I know this is the one song you all know.”  
And as expected, he was right — the audience sang every word back to him. Boone, caught up in the moment, repeated the chorus, turning it into an epic sing-along for fans to end the night on an unforgettable high note, literally. After executing a backflip off the stage to bid his farewells, Boone left Boston fans buzzing with excitement. Following the show, he made his way outside to greet fans, take photographs, and sign merchandise. 
Next up on the Fireworks & Rollerblades World Tour is The Fillmore in Philadelphia on April 14.
