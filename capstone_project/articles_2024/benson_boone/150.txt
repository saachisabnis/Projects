Get real!  Ariana Grande is NOT winning Best Pop Dance Recording.  Pure fucking delusion.

Producer of the year non classical winner who also won AOTY:
2012 – Paul Epworth with Adele’s 21
2014 – Pharrell Williams with Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories
2017 – Greg Kurstin with Adele’s 25
2020 – FINNEAS with Billie’s WWAFA, WDWG?
2024 – Jack Antonoff with Taylor’s Midnights
