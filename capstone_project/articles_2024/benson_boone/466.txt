  The layout for the Eras Tour is split into six sections with a mix of standing and seating at¬†Wembley.


  There are three areas for standing, front standing right (Blue), front standing left (Pink)¬†and general admission standing (Yellow).


  Away from standing, there are plenty of seated tickets on Level 1 (Green), Level 2 (Red) and Level 5 (Orange).


  All seating is reserved, it is also important to note that people buying in level 5 should be aware they are high up and not suitable if you have a fear of heights.

  Wembley Stadium¬†prohibits any ticket holders from bringing any bags into the stadium unless it adheres to the venue's regulations. If you have a bag that is non-compliant you will be refused entry.


  All bags are checked at an outdoor cordon and for any dispute of size, a bag gauge will be used so it's best to keep bags small.


  The most important rule to follow is that bags must be no larger than an A4 piece of paper.


  The official sizing is:


  Plus, if bags are full or folded over to reduce their size they will not be accepted.
