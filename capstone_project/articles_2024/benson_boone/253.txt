Earlier in the week, Schlossberg had hinted that he was dealing with a love setback.
On Thanksgiving, he posted a TikTok about heartbreak. "Someone said this to me the other day — you feel like you're mourning someone who's alive. Wow," he said.
"You can't get so down about breakups because — that's the thing — the other person's a psychopath. If they didn't want to be with you, they're so dumb," Schlossberg added.
