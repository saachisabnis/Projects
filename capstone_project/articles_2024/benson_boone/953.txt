Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's song "Carnival" (featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti) has climbed to the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This marks West's fifth chart-topping hit and Ty Dolla $ign's second. It's also the first for Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti. West's career now spans over 20 years of having number one hits, making him the first rap artist to achieve this milestone. He's also the first rapper ever to have topped the Hot 100 in three different decades – the 2000s, '10s, and '20s.
Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” rebounds to its No. 2, Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” holds at No. 3, Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” is steady at No. 4, and Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” fell to No. 5 after two weeks.
