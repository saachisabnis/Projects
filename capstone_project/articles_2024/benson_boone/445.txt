As Christmas approaches, parents often face the same dilemma every year: how to shop for kids who have everything they need.
Shopping for anyone is hard, unless they've straight up told you what they want.
Finding meaningful and practical gifts can be stressful, but here's a simple solution!  Have you ever followed the 5 Gift Rule?
It's a thoughtful way that encourage parents to focus on quality over quantity.  Instead of guessing what your kids might love, follow this guide and you're golden.
After you stop stressing over the perfect gifts, unwind with some of the most popular holiday cocktails in Illinois.
Obviously, you know your kids best.  So, if you're really trying to do Christmas without going overboard, try the 5 Gift Rule.  Plus, it takes the stress out of shopping, helping you stick to a budget while still giving meaningful presents.
I've started doing this with most of my family members and my boyfriend, and it's been an actual game-changer.  I stopped procrastinating, got my shopping done early, and all the gifts are wrapped already.  The most stress-free Christmas I've ever had!
