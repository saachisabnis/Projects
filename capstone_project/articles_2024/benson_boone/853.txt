Bryan Olesen performs George Michaels' "Freedom! '90" during The Voice finale. 
Bryan Olesen placed third on "The Voice."
The Lincoln singer, who fronts the Christian rock band VOTA, joins Hannah Huston, who also finished third in 2014, as finalists on "The Voice" from the Capital City.
Asher HaVon won the 25th season of the NBC singing contest Tuesday.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you. You went from having to fight your way onto the finale stage to be in the top three,‚Äù Olesen's coach John Legend said to him before the winner was announced by host Carson Daly.
Olesen did win a critical vote after failing to place in the top four to advance to the finals. After his blow-the-doors-off performance of Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄúViva La Vida,‚Äù he won the last-minute ‚Äúinstant save‚Äù vote to move on to this week‚Äôs finals.

During Monday‚Äôs live finals, Olesen sang the Benson Boone ballad ‚ÄúBeautiful Things," bringing the four coaches to their feet at its crescendo and followed that with George Michael‚Äôs ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90."
During Tuesday‚Äôs two-hour, guest-singer-packed finale, Olesen sang a soulful version of Joe Bonamassa‚Äôs ‚ÄúFeelin‚Äô Good‚Äù with Legend, swapping lines and blending their voices on the chorus.
‚ÄúI just sang with John Legend!!!‚Äù Olesen posted on Facebook about 30 minutes after their performance. ‚ÄúWhat a dream. That was the most amazing way to leave the Voice stage!!! Thank you America for giving me this experience!"
Before the performance, Legend and Olesen were shown in a pre-recorded conversation that included some discussion of the Lincoln singer's distinctive mohawk-like haircut.

‚ÄúRock stars, you have to like have a look, you‚Äôre not supposed to look like everybody else," Legend said. "I‚Äôm going to try Bryan‚Äôs haircut. It‚Äôs not for everyone. I feel like you look so good with it. I‚Äôm not as confident I would look so good with it.‚Äù
"At my age, I‚Äôm happy to still have some hair," said the 50-year-old Olesen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only shaving these (pointing to his temples) because they‚Äôre getting some gray in them.‚Äù
Olesen will get back to work shortly after returning to Lincoln. He‚Äôs scheduled to fill in fronting the ‚Äô80s band AM/FM for his daughter Jaydn, who is staying in Los Angeles to pursue an opportunity. Olesen will join AM/FM for a handful of early June dates, including the Telegraph Concert Series on June 5 and Fallbrook Summer Festival on June 7.
The Lied Center for Performing Arts also hopes to host a hometown concert for Olesen as it did for Huston a decade ago.
