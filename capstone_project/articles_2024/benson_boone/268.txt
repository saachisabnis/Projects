	The TouchTunes Frontline and Catalog charts for the third quarter of the year track the most played music on TouchTunes jukeboxes from July 1 to Sept. 30, with the Frontline ranking inclusive of music released in the last 18 months, followed by the Catalog tally for any music that was released more than 18 months ago. TouchTunes has jukeboxes in over 60,000 locations worldwide. TouchTunes data is not factored into other Billboard charts.

	Much like the first charts, which covered the second quarter of 2024 (April 1-June 30), “A Bar Song” is not only No. 1 on the Frontline Chart — it was also the most played song on TouchTunes overall, besting all entries on the Catalog Chart.

	Its continued reign is concurrent with the song’s ascension to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the timeframe; its coronation occurred on the July 13-dated Hot 100, and it’s ruled for 13 weeks in all (including the most recent survey, dated Oct. 12).

	The latest Frontline Chart represents the first full quarter of data for “A Bar Song”; Shaboozey released the song on April 12, 12 days into the second quarter of the year.

	In quarter two, the second-most-played song on TouchTunes was, unlike “A Bar Song,” a much older release – Chris Stapleton’s “Tennessee Whiskey,” which reigned on the Catalog Chart. And while, yes, “Tennessee Whiskey” indeed remains atop the latest Catalog survey, it’s surpassed by another Frontline contender in Post Malone’s Morgan Wallen-featuring “I Had Some Help,” which lifts to No. 2 on the Frontline Chart after premiering at No. 3 in quarter two.

	Like “A Bar Song,” the third quarter is also the first full tracking period of data for “I Had Some Help,” which was initially released May 10. The song preceded “A Bar Song” at No. 1 on the Hot 100, ruling for six weeks in all beginning in May.

	With Stapleton’s “Tennessee Whiskey,” from his 2015 album Traveller, again leading the Catalog Chart and ranking as the third-most-played song overall, the country genre occupies the entire top three.

	










Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” follows as the most-played non-country song, ranking at No. 3 on the Frontline Chart after appearing at No. 2 in the second quarter.

	It’s one spot ahead of perhaps the biggest mover of the month (as well as the most-played hip-hop song): Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” which leaps to No. 4. The Drake diss was released May 4, begetting an appearance at No. 18 on the inaugural Frontline Chart.

	Wallen’s “Cowgirls,” featuring Ernest (No. 5), and Hozier’s “Too Sweet” (No. 7) are the two other new entries into the Frontline Chart’s top 10.

	Meanwhile, the top three of the Catalog Chart remains intact, with the aforementioned “Tennessee Whiskey” followed by Toby Keith’s “I Love This Bar” and Garth Brooks’ “Friends in Low Places” at Nos. 2 and 3, respectively. Brooks & Dunn’s “Neon Moon,” a two-week No. 1 for the duo on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart in 1992, breaks into the top five, rising 6-4, and Wallen’s “Whiskey Glasses” (No. 8), Steve Earle’s “Copperhead Road” (No. 9) and Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” (No. 10) reach the top 10 for the first time.

	As for the top debut on either chart? Wallen again. “Lies Lies Lies” bows at No. 11 on the Frontline Chart following its July 5 release, followed by the Wallen-featuring “Whiskey Whiskey” by Moneybagg Yo at No. 12 after its June 14 premiere as part of the rapper’s album Speak Now.

	Sure enough, Wallen boasts eight appearances across both rankings — six on Frontline and two on Catalog. He has double the entries of the next closest, Jelly Roll, who appears three times on Frontline and once on Catalog.
