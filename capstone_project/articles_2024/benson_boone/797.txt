The Libertines are on target for the U.K. albums chart title, their first in 20 years. 

	Based on midweek sales and streaming data tallied by the Official Charts Company, the critically adored indie-rock outfit takes the lead with All Quiet On The Eastern Esplanade (via EMI), their fourth studio album. Spanning 11 tracks, the LP was produced by Dimitri Tikovoï (The Horrors/Charli XCX/Becky Hill) and recorded over four weeks during February and March 2023 at The Albion Rooms in Margate.

	The British act, comprising Carl Barât, Pete Doherty, John Hassall and Gary Powell, opened their chart account with their celebrated 2002 debut Up The Bracket (peaking at No. 35), then, following a tide of glowing features in the music press, hit No. 1 with their eponymously-titled sophomore album from 2004. Their 2015 comeback album, Anthems For Doomed Youth, also cracked the top 10, peaking at No. 3.

	Coming in at No. 2 on the midweek tally is British band The K’s debut LP I Wonder If The World Knows? (LAB), while U.S. singer and songwriter Conan Gray is predicted to complete the podium with Found Heaven (Island), which features production from Swedish maestro Max Martin. It’s new at No. 3 on the Official Chart Update. 

	Meanwhile, British indie rock veterans Feeder is targeting an 11th top 10 appearance with Black/Red (Big Teeth), new at No. 4 on the chart blast, while U.S. blues-rockers the Black Keys’ could snag a sixth U.K. top 10 with their 12th record Ohio Players (Nonesuch), new at No. 6 on the chart blast. 

J. Cole has been in the headlines of late. The U.S. rapper and songwriter surprise-dropped Might Delete Later (Interscope) last week, which included a Kendrick Lamar diss track, “7 Minute Drill,” a track he promptly apologized for. Might Delete Later might start at No. 7, based on midweek data, and should collect a third top 10 for Cole following 2018’s KOD (No. 2) and 2021’s The Off-Season (No. 2). 

	Finally, a string of recording are poised for top 40 berths. Among them, releases from Khruangbin (A LA SALA at No. 8 via Dead Oceans), Vampire Weekend (Only God Was Above Us at No. 9 via Columbia), Bob Vylan (Humble As The Sun at No. 11 via Ghost Theatre), Benson Boone (Fireworks & Rollerblades at No. 16 via Warner Records), Hawkwind (Stories From Time And Space at No. 20 via Cherry Red), Palace (Ultrasound at No. 22 via Fiction), Bryson Tiller (Bryson Tiller at No. 28 via Relentless), and Cock Sparrer (Hand On Heart at No. 33 via Cherry Red).

	All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Albums Chart is published late Friday, April 12.
