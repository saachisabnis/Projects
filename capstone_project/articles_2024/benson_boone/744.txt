The official Mediabase pop radio chart arrives on Sundays, and this week’s chart underscores the importance of waiting until the chart goes final.
While some prematurely celebrated a second week at #1 for SZA’s “Saturn,” the actual chart reveals a different outcome: an ascent to #1 for Hozier’s “Too Sweet.”
Up three places from last week’s position, “Too Sweet” claims #1 after a very close race. The song received 15,551 spins during the June 2-8 tracking period (+1,552), besting the 15,536 received by “Saturn” (-291). “Saturn” takes #2 this week.
Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” drops one spot to #3, while Ariana Grande’s “we can’t be friends (wait for your love)” descends one level to #4. Up one spot, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” earns #5.
