That’s a pretty big… MTV Video Music Award you got there, Benson Boone.
Although this isn’t the first time he’s rocked the garment, 22-year-old crooner Benson Boone is going viral for leaving one of his sold-out shows wearing nothing but a tiny American flag speedo. 
It’s giving 80’s vibes and may I say… He fills it out quite well – from both sides!

Boone, who hails from Washington, originally got his start as a TikTok star before competing in a previous season of American Idol. He left the competition early to sign a contract with Imagine Dragons’ label and now he’s a huge success story. 
His debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblades, debuted in the Top 10 in over thirteen countries including #6 in America. His single, Beautiful Things, took the #1 spot in over twenty countries and #2 in America. Both have been certified multi-platinum by the RIAA. 
And now he’s opening for Taylor Swift on her very own tour.

Let’s be honest, Benson appears to be packing in the aforementioned speedo. This leads me to a number of tongue in cheek comments including… If he turns out to be an only one hit wonder, he could always make a killing on OnlyFans. He’s got something just as big as his hit single. Etc, etc, etc.
