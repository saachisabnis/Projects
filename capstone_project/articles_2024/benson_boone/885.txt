	Conan O’Brien is set to make his first appearance as a guest on The Tonight Show since his unceremonious departure.

	The comedian hosted The Tonight Show between June 2009 and January 2010 but was replaced by Jay Leno’s return to the show after his short-lived primetime failure.

	O’Brien will now be a guest on Jimmy Fallon’s version of the show on April 9, to promote his long-in-the-works travelogue, Conan O’Brien Must Go, which debuts on Max on April 18. Other guests on that show include Nicole Richie and musical guest Benson Boone.

	The former Conan host – he hosted that show between 2010 and 2021 – has, however, made a short video appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s show before. In 2018, he appeared in a skit that the former SNL star and The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert did.

Conan O’Brien Must Go sees him visit new friends he’s met through his podcast, Conan O’Brien Needs a Fan, making stops in Norway, Thailand, Argentina, and Ireland.

	It is produced by Conaco and O’Brien exec produces with Jeff Ross.
