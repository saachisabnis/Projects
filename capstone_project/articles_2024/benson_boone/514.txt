The focus single from Taylor Swift’s chart-topping album “The Tortured Poets Department” becomes a radio #1 this week. “Fortnight,” which features Post Malone, rises two places to the top of the Mediabase hot adult contemporary chart.
“Fortnight” received ~5,582 Hot AC spins during the June 2-8 tracking period, topping last week’s mark by 763.
Down one spot, Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” earns #2. Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” descends one place to #3, while Hozier’s “Too Sweet” stays at #4.
Sabrina Carpenter’s “Feather” also holds steady, in its case keeping tabs on the #5 position.
