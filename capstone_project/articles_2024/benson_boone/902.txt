The world’s most famous cat lady, Taylor Swift, doesn’t forget where she came from and who she was there with, especially if they went to cat school together. Swift announced that she had added her Cats co-star METTE, as well as Benson Boone and Griff, as openers to her Wembley Stadium shows in late June for the Eras Tour. “Thought this might be a fun time to announce the first group of opening acts I’ll be adding to the London shows, going on before Paramore. I chose artists whose music I love listening to, and I can’t wait for them to add an extra jolt of excitement to our shows,” she said in an Instagram story. Does this mean “Beautiful Ghosts” can be a surprise song now?

Now, when Swift asked, “Are there still beautiful things?” Boone said, “Yes, I have them!” Boone has had a huge year so far, with his song “Beautiful Things” going #1 in multiple countries. Swift has been a fan of English singer Griff for a while now, first meeting at the 2021 Brit Awards, and she recently reshared Griff’s single “Vertigo,” the title track to her upcoming debut album. “8 yr old me who had fearless on repeat wouldn’t believe this,” said Griff in an Instagram caption on the news. Are you ready to go back to elementary school with her?
