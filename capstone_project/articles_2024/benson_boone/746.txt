Jennifer Lopez learned the hard way that love DOES cost a thing — your trust in a person.
The singer is reportedly at a loss as her second shot at happily ever after with Ben Affleck ended up being just a fairytale.
Lopez filed for divorce from the Batman star on Aug. 20, revealing that the former kindred spirits separated on April 26 — which happened to be the two-year anniversary of the lavish Georgia wedding.
"It’s really hit her hard. She’s very upset and disappointed with Ben," an insider spilled to People.

"She and Ben bought the house for the whole family. It’s way too big for her and filled with too many memories as well," the insider told the outlet.
Lopez shares twins Max and Emme, 16, with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Affleck shares daughters Violet, 18, Fin, 17, and son Samuel, 12, with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner.
