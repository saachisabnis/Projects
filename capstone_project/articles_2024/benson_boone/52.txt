Strictly Come Dancing has made its grand return, but it took mere seconds for the first moan about the brand new 2024 series to emerge.
The much-anticipated first live spectacle of this year's series commenced on Saturday evening (September 21), following hot on the heels of the launch episode where this year's celebs and their professional cohorts were revealed the previous week.
Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman are at the helm once again, guiding viewers as 15 fresh pairings step up to the challenge, all vying for victory and the coveted Glitterball trophy.
However, before the sequins and salsas could truly get in motion with the season's inaugural live performance, a pre-taped sketch featuring the stars' arrivals at Elstree Studios served as their introduction.
Viewers witnessed JB Gill taking his final bow on stage, Pete Wicks hanging up the headphones at his podcast station, and Shayne Ward receiving a pre-show spray tan, reports the Mirror.
Yet, the opener failed to dazzle some Strictly aficionados, prompting them to express their disdain online. One critic posted on X: "#Strictly I wish they would stop filling the time with we don't need to see all this. Stop wasting time.." Another voiced: "#Strictly that intro was weird."
Meanwhile, a different fan expressed delight: "The opening credits going for a comedy feel this year, I love it! #Strictly."
An enthusiast commented: "These intros are giving big brother vibes #Strictly", and one more lamented: "#SCD Missing the old orchestra intro music. #Strictly."
As the first live show gets underway, here's the full list of songs and dance routines for Strictly week one:
Viewers will have the opportunity to participate when the lines open in week two next Saturday (September 28), and the first elimination of the series will be broadcast the following night (Sunday, September 29). Tonight's excitement will commence at 7pm on BBC One, but there won't be a results show this weekend.
