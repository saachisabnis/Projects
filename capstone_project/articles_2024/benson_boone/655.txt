Samba hype is chugging along – and some say the steam is whistling down. But with the upcoming Adidas Samba OG ‘Floral’ collection, the German sportswear company is hoping to bring it aaaaaaaaaall right back.
From a distance, these sneakers look identical to the classic ‘Core Black’ and ‘Cloud White’ colourways that Very Famous People like Austin Butler and Benson Boone have worn time and again. They even feature the same plush leather base, suede overlays, and striped detailing across the laterals and medials.

But unlike the classic ‘Core Black’ and ‘Cloud White’ colourways, you'll find a series of tiny embroidered flowered scattered across each pair. The black gets ‘em in blue, while the white opts for lovely cherry blossom-esque ones instead. If farmer’s market vet Jeremy Allen White wore Adidas sneaks, you'd assume he'd get these in his collection ASAP.
Adidas' old school Trefoil logo hits the tongue tag, and both trainers rest on top of grippy brown rubber soles, just like the OGs from way back when. The ‘Floral’ collection is then signed off with “Samba” branding across the sidewalls.

The Adidas Samba OG ‘Floral’ collection is set to drop within the coming weeks at Adidas, the Confirmed app, and select shops globally. A retail price has yet to be officially confirmed, but expect to pay around £100 a pop.
