The women of pop won over the UK music scene in 2024
    
In news that will surprise few, Taylor Swift has topped the chart of the UK’s best-selling albums of 2024 with The Tortured Poets Department.

The year’s charts were dominated by women, with six of the top 10 entries taken up by solo female acts.

We reckon you may be able to guess at least a couple of them too.

Pop phenomenon Chappel Roan is in there at number six, while Charli XCX’s iconic Brat sits at number eight.

She is also just one of two British acts to make it into the top 10, alongside London’s own stadium-bothering Coldplay.

Streaming saw an 11% rise across the UK, and the streamed chart is the one not dominated by Swift. Instead, its the territory of folk-pop warbler Noah Kahan:


	1. Noah Kahan: Stick Season
	2. Sabrina Carpenter: Espresso
	3. Benson Boone: Beautiful Things
	4. Teddy Swims: Lose Control
	5. Hozier: Too Sweet
	6. Shaboozey: A Bar Song (Tipsy)
	7. Billie Eilish: Birds Of A Feather
	8. Chappell Roan: Good Luck, Babe!
	9. Sabrina Carpenter: Please Please Please
	10. Dasha: Austin
