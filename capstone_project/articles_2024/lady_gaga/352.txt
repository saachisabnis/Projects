The launch of the first trailer for “Joker: Folie à Deux” proved to be a major hit for Warner Bros. Pictures.
The teaser, which went online right after Warner’s CinemaCon presentation in Las Vegas, landed 167 million views in its first 24 hours.
Those trailer numbers and the film’s social engagement reportedly surpassed that of the first “Barbie” trailer and marks Warners’ biggest launch in recent years.
Helping the Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga-led film heavily was Gaga’s social media footprint which covers a massive 150 million followers.
Compared to other films this year, the launch came in ahead of other strong performers like “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” with 100M views, and “Inside Out 2” with 157M.   It was behind “Deadpool and Wolverine” at 365M but that figure incorporates Superbowl TV viewership into its numbers.
The original “Joker” surpassed $1 billion at the box-office in 2019, and the sequel is no doubt aiming for something on par or higher.
Zazie Beetz, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, Steve Coogan, Ken Leung and Harry Lawtey co-star in the film which hails once again from director Todd Phillips.
“Joker: Folie a Deux” will debut on the big screen on October 4th and screen in the Imax 70mm format.
