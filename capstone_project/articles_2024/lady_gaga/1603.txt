Musicians and music companies have until September 10th to register .MUSIC domains name with only a one-time $1.99 identity verification fee per domain name.
Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Spotify, UMG, Soundcloud, Ticketmaster, and Live Nation are among the artists and music companies already registering thier .MUSIC domains.
Music uses trusted partners as registration conduits, and Hypebot became one of the first to offer this service free of charge.
The one-time $1.99 identity verification fee is refundable if the user does not get the requested domain and does not want an alternative domain. Hypebot does not profit from this transaction.
The domain will launch globally in October at retail prices set by ICANN-accredited domain registrars and resellers.
