A 6-in-1 (yes six) moisturiser, primer, make up remover and more that has caught the attention of celebrities like Michelle Keegan, Karlie Kloss, Sydney Sweeney and Lady Gaga is being sold on Amazon for £8.06 (30ml). One of the shopping sites best sellers, Embryolisse - Lait-Crème Concentré has been described as a 'miracle' cream and contains a blend of natural ingredients rich in fatty acids, plant extracts and vitamins to boost your skin's moisture, essential nutrients and acts as a barrier from harsh conditions.
The 'exceptional' cream, which has been hailed for being 'luxuriously rich' and for leaving for skin 'supple and dewy', plumps fine lines and smooths inflammation and irritation "instantly" thanks to its inclusion of shea butter, beeswax, Aloe Vera and soy proteins (to name just a few ingredients).
Having gone viral on TikTok - with 40 million hashtag views - the French concoction, which is priced at just over £8, is loved by celebrity make up artists and professionals across the world and has been praised massively for its versatility - primer, moisturiser, intensive masque, cleanser, after-shaving lotion, and make-up remover; it does it all.
One beauty buff who bought the product and raved about it explained: "The versatility of this product is another major plus. It can be used as a primer before makeup application, and I've found that it creates a smooth canvas for foundation, helping it to glide on flawlessly and stay put throughout the day. Plus, it's a fantastic makeup remover, effortlessly dissolving even stubborn waterproof products without irritating my skin."
Some skincare lovers have even gone as far as to say that it's better - and cheaper - than the likes of skincare frontrunners Clinique, Benefit and Clarins and works wonders for sensitive skin.
One shopper, who gave the item on Amazon a five star review said it was the 'best product I've ever bought" and added: "I have tried every primer from Clinique, Benefit and Clarins and this is better! And cheaper! I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful but I’ve used this as a primer and a moisturiser! It’s perfect. Skin is firmer, softer and glowing. It’s not greasy either. Will never go back now! Also I was in a rush, I dropped a little blob into my foundation and the finish was as if I’d properly prepped my skin!!! Good trick!"
Another commented: "This stuff is absolutely amazing, it’s not only a fantastic primer, it’s a wonderful daily face moisturiser and also great for dealing with a sunburnt face, one product does it all and for a very reasonable price. Better than all the top name brands I’ve tried including Clarins, Elemis and Clinique!"
Several big names in the beauty and cinematic world have also marvelled at the cream's results with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow declaring it as a "miracle moisturiser" and Camille Razat saying: "My moisturiser from Embryolisse is great as a make-up base, because it helps the make-up penetrate the skin and really hydrate it.”
Michelle Keegan and Perrie Edwards' make up artist also revealed to The Mirror in 2022 that she never goes without Embryolisse's Lait-Creme Concentre Moisturiser and said: "Embryolisse has been such a staple in my kit since I first started Make-Up, it provides you with the most beautifully hydrated skin before applying any foundation, which is such a key part for the overall finish of a look."
She added: "I am never without Lait-Crème Concentrè at work. I use it on both TV and red-carpet appearances with clients such as Michelle Keegan, Perrie Edwards and Cath Tyldseley. I also love to use it on music videos with Nina Nesbitt as it’s perfect for all skin types and even those with sensitive skin like myself!"
Some dermatologists and customers, however, aren't quite as impressed by the French cream, stating it as an 'average' product', unable to understand the social media hype around it.
One said: "Not sure what all the hype is about this cream, it’s not as good as I’d been led to believe, I have a combination skin and it unfortunately didn’t suit me at all." Another added: "Was recommended by my sister, but this really doesn’t work for me. Skin does not stay hydrated, but dries quickly, leaving that tight unmoisturised feel. Obviously counteracting my bad review, my sister would say it was excellent. So should say I have dry, sensitive skin and have been struggling with finding a moisturiser that works."
Now, we at The Mirror are a sucker for a celeb-approved beauty buy, so if Embryolisse isn't quite your cup of tea, we have a few alternative suggestions that are sure to leave your skin glowy, luminous and well hydrated.
Molly Mae Hague swears by Tatcha's Dewy Skin Cream as well as the ELEMIS Superfood Glow Priming Moisturiser. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber and Victoria Beckham opt for Weleda's Skin Food and Avène Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream.
