Written by Karen Fairchild, Jimi Westbrook, Kimberly Schlapman, Philip Sweet, Dave CobbTo commemorate their 25th anniversary, Little Big Town went big in 2024. The trio went on tour with Sugarland, performed their NBC holiday special Little Big Town’s Christmas at the Opry, and released a greatest hits album. The trio also released their first holiday album The Christmas Record, featuring covers of Merle Haggard‘s “If We Make It Through December,” Stevie Wonder‘s “Someday at Christmas,” Amy Grant‘s “Tennessee Christmas,” holiday classics like “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” The Christmas Record also features several originals, including “Glow,” “Christmas Night With You,” “Believe in Christmas,” the closing “Holiday,” and the more nostalgic “Evergreen,” in remembrance of loved ones who are no longer around.I remember me and daddy cutting down our family Christmas treeOn an early morning in December, coldest winter, 1983We were driving home to mama, snowing like we’d never seen beforeForever in my memory, red plaid apron standing in the doorForevermoreIt’s evergreen, it’s evergreenAnd I believe, it’s evergreenFlying down Highway 20, crossing that Alabama lineMy heart is full of memoriеs, like a rearview mirror in my mindGrandaddy’s telling stories, everybody’s staying up all nightWithout a care, without a worry, way to young to know to hold on tightBut that’s alright
Written by Ed SheeranEd Sheeran said he wrote his first “sad Christmas song” for the Netflix animated feature That Christmas, which is based on Love Actually director Richard Curtis’ children’s book. “Under the Tree” tells of a lonely Christmas. “It’s the one thing I’ve wanted to write,” said Sheeran, who was asked by Curtis to contribute a holiday song to the film and later directed the music video. “I’d never seen the need [to write] a sad Christmas song until writing this on,” added Sheeran. “This is quite a lot of people’s realities at Christmas.”I’m alone this DecemberIt’s the last light of the dayOh, I can’t help but wonderIf you feel the sameOh, I guess I’ll surrenderTo the tears and the painAnd the cold we are under will remainYou were the hearth light, my fire that diedWaiting for morning sunriseThere is nothing under the treeThat I wished forI want you to come back to meAnd be like beforeHave I lost youAnd nothin’ will ever fill the hole?My heart will be here under the treeJust letting you know

A collection of 16 renditions of holiday standards, the album also features four originals she co-wrote, including “Find the Love,” “Make It to Christmas,” “Almost Christmas,” featuring Common, and “Santa for Someone.” The latter centers around the more special gifts that money can never buy.
I gotta get this paper so I can wrap these gifts(What am I gonna get DOJ and the boys?)I hope I don’t forget nobody on this long, long list(I ain’t forget anybody, did I?)Anybody in the spirit? (Hallelujah)Well, throw a little my way (Ooh)I got the whole car filled up to the brim, it’s like I’m driving a sleigh(Driving a sleigh, let’s go)I just wanna get you presents from the heartBut the ones that you want gon’ break my credit cardI’m runnin’ around, and it’s got me all stressedI just want your Christmas, baby, to be the best
Written by Jack Antonoff
Jack Antonoff described the Bleachers’ plaintive “Merry Christmas, Please Don’t Call,” as a song “for everyone who experiences the holidays as a time to clean out those who have done you wrong.” The lyrics revisit painful old relationships. “This for anyone who has come to realize someone’s been chipping away at them,” added Antonoff, “and does not intend to stop.”
To the tempo of your uptightIs the flicker of a streetlightYou know this moment don’t yaAnd time is strangely calm now‘Cause everybody’s gone it’sJust you and your angerOh, golden boy, don’t act like you were kindYou were mine, but you were awful every timeSo don’t tell them what you told meDon’t hold me like you know meI would rather burn foreverBut you should know that I died slowRunning through the halls of your haunted homeAnd the toughest part is that we both knowWhat to happened to youWhy you’re out on your ownMerry Christmas, please don’t call
Written by Michael Bublé, Jann Arden, Chase Mcgill, Gregory William Wells
After releasing his first holiday album Christmas in 2011, Michael Bublé’ has continued adding new contributions during the seasons. In 2024, it was “Maybe This Christmas,” a duet with Carly Pearce, a song following two people trying to reach out to one another. “’Maybe This Christmas’ will likely resonate with anyone who might face the challenge of going through another holiday alone or has been through that experience in the past,” said Bublé. “Honestly because it comes from so deep within me. It’s something that happened to me, something I went through, and sometimes God just gives you the words. Sometimes you’re just a conduit.”
I’ve been running all my lifeI’ve been trying to get it rightSentimentally, the thing I do wellBut it’s Christmastime againAnd I’m missing all my friendsA million miles away, a toast to their healthNow it’s a shot out in the darkI’m just wishing on a starAnd I wish I knew just what to doLord, I think I need your lightOn this cold and silent nightI’m just hanging on, it’s all that I can doAnd all the snowFalling down on the city, and the good souls belowIt ain’t the sameWhen it comes down and turns into rain‘Cause it’s ChristmastimeI can’t be alone again
Written by Jimmy Fallon, Ido Zmishlany, and Nick Long
Along with his previously released duets—“It Was a… (Masked Christmas)” featuring Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion from 2021, “Almost Too Early For Christmas” with Dolly Parton in 2022, and the Megan Trainor duet “Wrap Me Up,” released in 2023—Jimmy Fallon’s debut holiday album, Holiday Seasoning, also features collaborations with a collection of special guests from the Roots, Jonas Brothers, Justin Timberlake, “Weird Al” Yankovic, Will Ferrell, Chelsea Handler, and Cara Delevingne.Fallon also sings several original songs he co-wrote solo, including the nostalgic “How You Know It’s Christmastime.”
Christmastime is here, my favorite time of yearYou can put a tree inside your house and no one will think it’s weirdTwinkling lights, snowball fights bring smiles from ear to earThat’s how you know that Christmastime is hereGrandma’s drunk on eggnog, grandpa fell asleepThe kids are shaking all the presents underneath the treeSinatra’s singing carols, bringing all your loved ones nearThat’s how you know that Christmastime is hereMother sets the table, father carves the roastYour aunt’s mad at your uncle ’cause he’s telling dirty jokesHome Alone and mistletoe, all good tidings and cheerThat’s how you know that Christmastime is here

Even though “Call Me Irresponsible” is not an original Christmas song, it hasn’t been covered as often as some of the more classic holiday songs with some previous renditions by Frank Sinatra, Gloria Estefan, and Michael Bublé. This year, Steve Perry delivered his version with an unexpected guest, his late father Raymond Francis Perry (1919-1998). “My father, Ray Perry, was a singer and when I was a child he would sing to me at bedtime,” said Perry of the track released on his holiday album The Season 3. “I recently found a karaoke cassette of my dad singing that he sent me back in 1993 for Christmas. “The one song that touched me the most was, ‘Call Me Irresponsible.’ His voice was lovely, but the karaoke track was not.” His father’s voice was pulled from the old cassette and weaved into a new duet with Perry. “Once that was done, an unfulfilled dream of singing with my father was now possible,” shared Perry. “You see, mom and dad divorced when I was 7, and dad and I never saw much of each other after that. Singing with my father after all these years was a very emotional experience for me.  His voice was just as I remembered it as a child.”

Perry added, “At the end of his cassette dad says, ‘Merry Christmas, God Love Ya.’ To hear him speak again brought tears to my eyes.” 
Call me irresponsibleCall me unreliableThrow in undependable tooDo my foolish alibisBother youWell, I’m not too cleverI just adore youCall me unpredictableTell me I’m impracticalRainbows I’m inclined to pursueCall me irresponsibleYes, I’m unreliableBut it’s undeniably trueI’m irresponsibly mad for you
