Taylor Swift celebrated Travis Kelce‘s Super Bowl win with several long embraces on the field at Allegiant Stadium on Sunday night.

	Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs, beat the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night to win Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.



	During the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Swift was seen standing next to Kelce’s mom, Donna, as he spoke with CBS Sports broadcaster Jim Nantz.

	She was seen smiling and clapping as the Chiefs’ tight end first busted into a few lines of Elvis Presley’s song “Viva Las Vegas” before then leading the crowd in the Beastie Boys’ “Fight for Your Right.”

	After that rousing speech, Swift greeted Kelce with a long hug and several kisses on the field, as she did two weeks ago when the Chiefs won the AFC Championship Game.

	During the game, Swift watched from a suite alongside a group of her friends, including Miles Teller, Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and Blake Lively.

	It’s been speculated that this game could set a record viewership record, given the interest in Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and flew to Vegas after performing her fourth and final Eras Tour show in Tokyo on Saturday.

A slew of stars were in the audience to watch the game Sunday, including Swift, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Paul Rudd and LeBron James.

	The pregame entertainment featured Reba McEntire performing the National Anthem, Post Malone singing “America the Beautiful” and Andra Day performing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Usher hit the stage for the halftime show along with special guests including Alicia Keys, H.E.R., will.i.am, Jermaine Dupri, Lil Jon later and Ludacris.
