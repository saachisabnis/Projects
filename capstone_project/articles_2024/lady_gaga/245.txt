(& the hot people running them) 
If it weren‚Äôt for nightclubs, we wouldn‚Äôt have disco, Lady Gaga, or a BRAT summer. And behind every popular after-hours venue is a fabulous in-the-know staff keeping it up and running. V hit the dancefloor to find out more about Brooklyn and Queens‚Äô hottest spots and the tastemakers defining them.
Can you give us the backstory behind the name?
I like people‚Äôs theories behind the name too much‚Ä¶I‚Äôm obsessed with the lore, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever reveal the origin üòâ

What‚Äôs the craziest thing that‚Äôs ever happened here?
Besides the arson? Isabella Lovestory parked an LED truck out front and transformed the whole club into a psychedelic operating room for her video premiere. AG Cook‚Äôs show was so crazy, we had to briefly empty the venue out so people could get some oxygen.

Midori Sour. Try it how we do it: with freshly juiced melon and citric acid.

Someone who cares about queer and trans people of color, and has proper descalation and harm-reduction skills. They should also be okay with loud techno, and not easily shaken by rowdy customers at the door. (Bonus if they‚Äôre a cutie because we have a cute staff.)
3 words to describe this place?
DJ‚Äôs Favorite Club.
Can you give us the backstory behind the name?
We were kinda going for a shiny/glamorous discotheque theme and we were thinking something diamond-oriented might get the point across. We came across this diamond named ‚ÄúParagon‚Äù that is supposedly the largest flawless diamond in the world‚Ä¶ Felt absurd yet subtle.

Can you give us the backstory behind the name?
At the time we opened (in 2012) the Cabaret Law was still in effect and it was literally illegal to dance. NYPD was raiding everything that appeared to be even vaguely dance music-oriented, so we wanted to pick a name that sounded both mature and low-key in order to avoid being shut down. We named the bar ‚ÄúBossa Nova‚Äù after the relaxing vacation music genre and the NYPD shut us down anyway.
When was Bossa Nova Civic Club founded?
2012.

Late night weekends but the best time to visit, in my opinion, is weeknights anytime after 11.

Kim Ann Foxman, Steve Summers, Umfang.
What‚Äôs the craziest thing that‚Äôs ever happened here?
Lots of psychotic events have taken place here but one of my personal favorites was our opening month when this rabid lady covered our bathrooms in all of this notably passionate Anti-Lena Dunham graffiti and then went on Yelp and accused us of being essentially in cahoots with Lena Dunham. As far as I know, no one who has ever worked at Bossa has been affiliated with Lena Dunham.

The Tropical Goth: Jamaica and vanilla-infused mezcal, honey, and fresh lemon juice topped with White Label Yerba Mate Soda.
What do you look for in a staff member?
