The 12-piece collection features a maxi skirt, a silk-blend slip dress with teal ties, orange and red cotton poplin dresses, a tailored suit, and an asymmetric dress.
Retail prices range from £250 for satin maxi skirts and cotton dresses to £495 for silk maxi dresses. The collection is available on Jigsaw's website and in selected Jigsaw stores from today (17 May).
Roksanda Ilinčić said: "Our second collection for Jigsaw presents a continuation of narrative inspired by art, dance, movement and colour. Fluid dresses mixed with masculine tailoring, hand painted prints inspired by 'flowers in motion’ are some of the elements that have shaped this collection into an expression of movement and freedom, softness and strength."
Earlier this week, it was reported that Ilinčić sold her eponymous label to Damian Hopkins-owned The Brand Group. Founded in 2006 by Ilinčić, who will remain as creative director, Roksanda made its name showing at London Fashion Week and has dressed celebrities such as Anne Hathaway and Lady Gaga.
