A Leicestershire town's annual Pride festival is set to take place this weekend. The event, in Ashby, will include live performances, family-friendly activities, and more than 40 stalls.

The festivities will kick off at 12pm with a performance by Miss TuTu, followed by a musical line-up that will include Jordan Eagles, Brandon Long and Kyle Finn. The headline acts will be a Lady Gaga tribute performance by Joanne Shallow at 3pm, and a Taylor Swift tribute act by Taylored Swift at 7pm.
