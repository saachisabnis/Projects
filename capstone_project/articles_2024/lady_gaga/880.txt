Lady Gaga has been widely praised for her turn in Joker: Folie √† Deux, but some have questioned the missing scenes, from behind the scenes to the initial trailers.
It seems like things were reworked up to the very last minute, with Gaga‚Äôs Lee Quinzel and Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs Arthur Fleck having much different outcomes.
A month ago, Gaga told¬†Vanity Fair that the filmmaking trio would ‚Äúvery often meet in Joaquin‚Äôs trailer, and sometimes we would just tear the script up and start all over.‚Äù Phillips subsequently confirmed they did a lot of rewriting on the film, particularly on the controversial ending.
According to scoopers like MyTimeToShineHello and additional outlets, the film‚Äôs original ending followed Arthur catching up with Lee on the iconic steps, but the outcome varied.
One version had Gaga‚Äôs Lee fully embrace her Harley Quinn side by killing Fleck before dancing and singing That‚Äôs Entertainment. Another reading was the police swarming Arthur to arrest as Lee watched his demise and her rise. Both of these boil down to more of Lady Gaga. Check out a video from the set here‚Ä¶

So, supposedly they filmed 3 different endings for #JokerFolieADeux in case the real one (which ‚Äúit did‚Äù) leaked and they decided to NOT GO WITH THIS ONE??? pic.twitter.com/mMQao2A4LE

Joker: Folie √† Deux opened to a lackluster $40 million debut and sits at 33% on Rotten Tomatoes. With a D CinemaScore (the lowest for a comic book movie), the following weekend box office will be fascinating.
‚ÄúJoker: Folie ƒÑ Deux‚Äù finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham, awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love but also finds the music that‚Äôs always been inside him.
The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker opposite Oscar-winner Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born). The film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out, Capote), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker.
