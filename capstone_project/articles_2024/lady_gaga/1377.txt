Lady Gaga has been giving hints about the possibility of her next album, LG7, arriving soon. Her fans went wild when she recently posted three cryptic black-and-white photos on Instagram on Feb. 08, 2024.
The first photo had only a black heart emoji, while the second had a red demon emoji. However, the third photo sparked curiosity as it had the caption, “Tik tok tik tok.”

In all three photos, Gaga sports a long blonde ponytail, and the first photo is a simple selfie of her in a trench coat. The second and third photos were taken in the studio, with her face hidden in shadows, surrounded by keyboards and mixing desks, giving a moody vibe.
Gaga has been teasing her fans with sneak peeks of the recording studio for some time.
