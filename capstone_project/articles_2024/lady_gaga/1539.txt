The 2024 Paris Olympics games are finally underway.
On July 26, Céline Dion and Lady Gaga kicked off the event by performing one song each in French on the worldwide stage. This marked the first time that Dion has performed in public in years following her stiff person syndrome diagnosis.
After her performance, Dion took to social media to say how “honored” she was to sing in the ceremony.
“I’m honored to have performed tonight, for the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony, and so full of joy to be back in one of my very favorite cities!” she wrote on Instagram.
“Most of all, I’m so happy to be celebrating these amazing athletes, with all their stories of sacrifice and determination, pain and perseverance,” she continued. “All of you have been so focused on your dream, and whether or not you take home a medal, I hope that being here means that it has come true for you! You should all be so proud, we know how hard you have worked to be the best of the best. Stay focused, keep going, my heart is with you!”
