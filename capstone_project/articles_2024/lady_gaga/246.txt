Beetlejuice, ET the Extra-Terrestrial and Britney Spears are among the impressive Halloween looks celebrities have adopted this year.
Love Island host Maya Jama, who hosts an annual star-studded Halloween party, maintained her high standard of costumes by creating a tailored Beetlejuice outfit for October 31.
Instead of donning the character’s classic black and white striped suit, she modernised it into a blazer dress with statement shoulders which she paired with matching stockings and black high heels.

To finish the look she wore a luminous green curly wig to represent the hair of the character, who actor Michael Keaton recently revisited in the 2024 Beetlejuice sequel.
Alongside a series of photos of the costume posted to Instagram, Jama wrote: “Beetlejuice’s Unruly Niece. Happy Halloweeeeen SO EXCITED FOR TONIGHT.”
US socialite Paris Hilton opted for Britney Spears’ outfit in the Baby One More Time music video, donning a tied white shirt, grey cardigan, grey pleated skirt and the classic pigtail hairstyle.
She shared a host of snaps of her posing in the costume beside pink school lockers and in a classroom to Instagram, writing: “It’s Britney bitch. Love you icon @BritneySpears”
