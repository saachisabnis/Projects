Another nineties tune that X users have mentioned several times is 'You Get What You Give,' which was New Radicals' most popular hit from their one and only 1998 studio album.

The 2000s and 2010s are full of songs sung by Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, but music enthusiasts could still recite lyrics to one-hit wonders by Psy and Carly Rae Jepsen.
Psy's 'Gangnam Style' was an instant viral K-pop hit that took the US by storm in 2012, and at one point, it was the most viewed video on YouTube.
He also made numerous appearances, and with the help of MC Hammer, he made celebrities get up and dance to his 'Gangnam Style' performance at the American Music Awards.
'Saying PSY is a one hit wonder... You'll never understand the impact of that that and gentleman,' an X user tweeted.
Despite him only being a one-hit one in the US, he's still popular in Korea, and is considered one of the musicians who helped K-pop become more popular in America.
Carly Rae Jepsen was known for competing in Canadian Idol, and after she was praised by Justin Bieber, she released her number one hit 'Call Me Maybe' in 2011.
Not only was it the best-selling digital single worldwide in 2012, but it also spend nine weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.Â 
'Call Me Maybe was too big that she did not stand a chance,' an X user wrote.

Despite there being hundreds of one-hit wonders to choose from, most X users have seemingly selected 'Somebody That I Used to Know' as the top pick.
'Anyone who isn't saying Gotye for Somebody That I Used To Know isn't picking a good choice,' tweeted a fan.
The song won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards, and after its fame calmed down, Gotye left the spotlight.
'I always wondered what happened to Gotye. Bugger just disappeared into thin air after 'Now You're Just Somebody That I Used To Know,'' an X user wrote.Â
