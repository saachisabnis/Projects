Fashion fans will be refreshing their feeds on double time as the world's most fashionable famed faces descend on The Metropolitan Museum of Art steps to celebrate the 2025 Met Gala. 
This year's theme is 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style' while the dress code for the night is 'Tailored for You'. Fashion fanatics are expecting to see the exhibition explore the history and significance of Black dandyism, and its influence on style.
Over five decades on from the first theme 'The World of Balenciaga' which paid tribute to the famous Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1973, we take a look back at some of the most influential Met Gala themes from the last few years...

The 2024 Met Gala theme, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, celebrated the revival of historical garments too delicate to be worn. The exhibition featured approximately 250 rare items from the Costume Institute's collection, spanning over 400 years of fashion history. Advanced technologies like video animation and AI provided deeper context to each piece. The dress code, 'The Garden of Time,' inspired by J.G. Ballard's short story, led to a red carpet adorned with floral and nature-inspired designs. Co-chairs Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth graced the event, though some critics felt the gala's theme lacked the "excitement" of previous years.

Last year's theme was a homage to fashion royalty the late Karl Lagerfeld whose career in the fashion industry pioneers countless iconic aesthetics and history-making looks. The Costume Institute showcased over 150 garments from his six-decade reign working at Chanel, Fendi, Chloe and his namesake brand, Karl Lagerfeld. 
Attendees of the event went all out for the evening, Doja Cat even went as far as to cosplay as the late designer's beloved feline friend Choupette.

The 2022 theme was the second part of the Costume Institute’s homage to American Designers, the first being In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, which was the theme for 2021. The Met Gala doubled down on its love affair with Americana, this time with a glittering gaze on the Gilded Age - think Vanderbilt excess, corsets, and drama by gaslight. 
Dubbed 'Gilded Glamour,' the theme inspired some era-accurate grandeur (Blake Lively’s Statue of Liberty-inspired Versace dress transformed on the steps). 2022 was the year Kim Kardashian made headlines for wearing Marilyn Monroe's iconic diamanté encrusted dress that she wore to serenade President Kennedy, while Lizzo gave us a flute-solo moment in custom Thom Browne. Opulence was in the air - and on every square inch of tulle and train.

Designed to shed light on American designers both past, present and future, the America: A Lexicon of Fashion exhibition included over 100 pieces from American designers. Guests of the event including Zoë Kravitz, Billie Eilish and Rihanna all stepped out in designer ensembles which all effortlessly highlighted the theme on the world stage.

Possibly one of the most iconic themes to date, 2019 saw famed faces and designers work together to create showstopping garments that channel the camp aesthetic made famous in the 1960s. Zendaya wore a light-up Cinderella dress by Tommy Hilfiger whilst Lady Gaga donned not one, not two, not three but four custom Brandon Maxwell ensembles.

Inspired by the Vatican and its holy archive items, 2018's theme paid tribute to religious art and all its glory. Many stars took the theme literally, donning crystal-encrusted headpieces and intricately embroidered gowns in rich burgundy and gold hues. 
7/15
In honour of Japanese designer and founder of Comme des Garçons and Dover Street Market, Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between was a spectacle all about wacky, weird and iconic objects loved by the famed designer. This was also the year Bella Hadid wore a crochet black catsuit and Cara Delevingne painted her head metallic silver. 
8/15
Focusing on the contrast between handmade and machine-made garments, 2016’s theme was interpreted by stars donning both archival haute couture pieces and futuristic recycled plastic bottle gowns. 
9/15
This was the year Beyoncé stunned in a sheer, crystal-encrusted Givenchy gown and Rihanna took up the whole red carpet steps with her opulent yellow cape and dress look by Chinese couture designer Guo Pei. The theme was all about celebrating China’s effect on the Western fashion world, headed up by both the Department of Asian Art and the Costume Institute.
10/15
Co-chaired by Sarah Jessica Parker, Bradley Cooper and Oscar de la Renta the 2014 theme was a homage to late designer Charles Wilson Brega James, who was considered “fashion’s first genius.” Tailored suiting, intricate use of materials and draped designs were at the forefront this year.
11/15
Focusing on the heavily celebrated punk movement of both New York and London, the theme for 2013 was all about DIY culture and the couture concept of "made-to-measure." Many stars leaned into the punk aesthetic, opting for mesh materials, cutout panels, leather accessories and metal-encrusted layering.
12/15
The 2012 theme imagined a dialogue between two Italian fashion powerhouses: Elsa Schiaparelli and Miuccia Prada. Despite being from different eras, the exhibition juxtaposed their works to explore similarities in their approaches to fashion, art, and society. The red carpet was a blend of surrealism and modern minimalism, reflecting the innovative spirits of both designers.
13/15
A poignant tribute to the late designer Alexander McQueen, the 2011 Met Gala showcased his revolutionary designs that blended gothic elements with romanticism. The exhibition highlighted McQueen's ability to challenge fashion norms, and the attendees honoured his legacy with bold, avant-garde ensembles that echoed his fearless creativity.
14/15
The 2010 theme delved into the evolution of American women's fashion, tracing styles from the 1890s to the 1940s. It examined how fashion mirrored societal shifts and the changing roles of women. The gala's red carpet was a tapestry of vintage-inspired gowns and modern interpretations, celebrating the diverse sartorial journey of the American woman.

In 2009, the Met Gala spotlighted the symbiotic relationship between fashion designers and their muses - aka models. Celebrating iconic figures like Twiggy and Naomi Campbell, the event underscored how models have both influenced and been influenced by fashion trends. The red carpet shimmered with attendees channeling the essence of their favorite fashion eras.
