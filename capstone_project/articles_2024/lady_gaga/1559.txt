Elton John's kids not only have one of the most iconic musicians to ever live as a dad, but even their childhood bedtime stories featured a special appearance from another pop superstar. 
The "Your Song" singer stopped by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday (December 17) where he spoke about how he and husband David Furnish used to have a special bedtime routine with their two sons — Zachary 13, and Elijah, 11 — when they were younger, including how they would sing them to sleep, per People. 
"We sang them to bed. We read them stories every night, even when they couldn't understand what we were saying. It was a ritual that we held them," John explained, before going on to share how Lady Gaga even had a heartwarming routine with the youngsters. "Gaga, who's their godmother, used to come and bathe them and sing them to bed."
Elsewhere in the interview, the "Candle In The Wind" singer revealed whether plans to continue making music after retiring from touring. 
John was also recently honored by TIME as the publication's Icon of the Year and in the wide-ranging interview, he opened up about a variety of topics, from the "most embarrassing thing" in his life to what he considers as one of the "greatest mistakes of all time."
