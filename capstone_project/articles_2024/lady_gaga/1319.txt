There will be no tickets to Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly‘s downfall. 
The Transformers actress and “my ex’s best friend” rapper proved they’re going strong by spending the past weekend at Nemacolin luxury resort’s summer solstice celebration in Pennsylvania. 
And the couple—who got engaged in January 2022—came dressed to impress for the festivities, which included performances by Michael Bublé and Lady Gaga, as well as tennis lessons with John McEnroe.
During one event, Megan, 37, and MGK, 34, even coordinated outfits, both wearing blue-and-white pinstripe blazers. To complete the night’s look, the Jennifer’s Body star paired her oversized jacket with fishnet tights and a diamond choker necklace. Meanwhile, the mainstream sellout artist rocked a matching pinstripe suit pants and black loafers. 
The star-studded celebration featured cameos from quite a few other celebs as well. At one point, Neil Patrick Harris and husband David Burtka posed alongside Megan and MGK—real name Colson Baker—at the hotel. Plus, Lily Rabe and partner Hamish Linklater, Adrien Brody and wife Georgina Chapman and Marisa Tomei were among those in attendance.
