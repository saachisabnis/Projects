With deliveries of Volvo’s much-anticipated EX90 model finally coming through in the U.S., drivers who are also music fans may be heartened by discovering what the electric SUV’s sound system is made of.
They might even get a cosmic experience if they decide to play The Beatles’ 1965 classic hit Drive My Car on that sound system: The EX90 is the first vehicle ever to feature an Abbey Road Studios’ mode, providing a sound quality engineered straight out of the world’s most famous music recording studios. The Beatles enshrined Abbey Road in history, when they gave the studios’ name to their last album in 1969.
Besides The Beatles, countless artists — from Pink Floyd and Radiohead to Kanye West and Lady Gaga — have recorded at Abbey Road, which is located in London. The studios, where stereo was first patented in 1933, have to this day remained home to numerous innovations in recording technology.
Over the years, Abbey Road engineers studied the sound architecture of the equipment used there before using the data to develop software plug-ins.
Inside the EX90, the Abbey Road Studios mode is delivered via a 25-speaker Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) system, which promises to deliver “an innovative new sound technology designed to transform the in-car listening experience.”
Our review of the EX90’s B&W system found its Dolby Atmos feature produces “an impressive 3D effect.” That B&W system, however, is only available on the higher-level EX90 Ultra grade.
This year’s launch of the EX90, along with that of the EX30, a smaller and more affordable electric SUV, is part of Volvo’s strategy to boost its otherwise slumping sales of EVs in the U.S.
The EX90 is also the Swedish automaker’s first vehicle designed for the U.S. market and also built in the U.S. The first EX90s came out of the product line of Volvo’s South Carolina plant in June.

Whether it’s big sedans or SUVs, Mercedes-Benz is one of the top names in luxury vehicles for people who can’t be bothered to drive themselves. And now the automaker is trying to apply that expertise to a very different form factor.
Mercedes is launching a new generation of vans that are also its first to be designed from the ground up for electric powertrains, while still performing all of the functions of its current van lineup. But before it shows the everyday delivery vehicles and hotel shuttles, Mercedes is heralding the arrival of these new vans with the Vision V — a concept vehicle that shows just how luxurious a van can be.
An official reveal is just days away, but Slate Auto—a stealthy EV startup reportedly backed by Jeff Bezos—is already turning heads and raising eyebrows with one of the wildest marketing stunts in recent automotive memory. With its first vehicle set to be unveiled on April 24, the company has spent the past week dropping bizarrely camouflaged “prototypes” across the streets of Los Angeles, wrapped in parody business ads so surreal they’ve sparked viral curiosity across Reddit, TikTok, and the auto press.
It all started when gearheads and influencers spotted multiple strange vehicles parked casually in Venice, California. One appeared to be a stubby, boxy SUV wrapped in branding for a fake company called “CryShare,” which claims to soothe babies by driving them around on the roof. Another sported branding for a fictional feline therapy firm, complete with a web address: CatThurrrapy.com. That site, it turns out, is the key to the whole puzzle—once visited, it redirects to Slate Auto, teasing their upcoming April 24 announcement.
So what do we actually know about these vehicles? Visually, they appear to be a mix of design cues: think Range Rover Classic meets Jeep Renegade, with unmistakable off-road hints and compact proportions. At least three variants have been spotted so far—a two-door pickup truck and two SUV silhouettes with slightly different rooflines. None of them are functional; they’re likely design bucks—mock-ups without working powertrains or suspensions. But the intention is clear: create a spectacle, then drop the specs.
According to TechCrunch, Slate Auto has quietly been developing this project since 2022 as a spinout of Re:Build Manufacturing. The goal? Deliver a modular, two-seat electric pickup truck for just $25,000, with production targeted for late 2026. Unlike Tesla and Lucid, which launched with high-priced luxury models, Slate wants to flip the model: start cheap, scale up.
And it’s not just about affordability. As we reported, the company is embracing a “build-your-own” philosophy, offering upgrades over time—modular performance, tech, or lifestyle add-ons customers can install like a grown-up LEGO kit. The tagline? “We built it. You make it.”
On April 24, we’ll find out if the substance lives up to the show. But one thing’s already clear: Slate Auto knows how to make an entrance.
Lovers of retro automobiles, take note: the new special edition Porsche 911 is a treat for the eyes. Inspired by the 1970s, the Porsche 911 Spirit 70 is a modern car with classic styling, set apart by its go-faster stripes and olive green paint job.
Based on the 911 Carrera GTS Cabriolet, the new special edition is part of Porsche's Heritage Design series which celebrates the iconic looks of the past. For the era of Saturday Night Fever, the Bees Gees, and Pong, Porsche has borrowed from the past with the Olive Neo color, the psychedelic Pasha pattern for the interior, and bold black graphics.
