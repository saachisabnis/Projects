Being a mom means doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work. Whether they’re making sure everyone is on schedule, giving their kid a much-needed pep talk or running point on logistics before going into an office every day, moms are surely doing a lot more than we all think.
Moms may start out as a stealth role model during their kids’ first few years of life, but as their children grow older, they’ll start to see all the little (and sometimes big) things that make their mother an inspiration, regardless of what their individual goals are.
While some people in a mom’s family or community may not recognize all that they do, others are a little bit more tuned in.
Wearing multiple hats at once can be exhausting and can weigh heavily on mothers’ shoulders. But, what always helps lighten the load — for anyone, not just moms — is when someone calls out your efforts and tells you they see even just a piece of what you do.
So, this Mother’s Day, give the moms in your life that gift. Tell them you recognize all that they do and that, even though they may not be getting appropriate praise, it’s still worth all the effort in the end.
To help you make your point this holiday, we’ve rounded up 68 quotes from celebrities, thought leaders and more across centuries of history.
