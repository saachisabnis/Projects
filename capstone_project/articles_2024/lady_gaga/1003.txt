Bolton-based online electricals retailer AO has announced it is extending its naming rights sponsorship of Manchester’s AO Arena until 2030.
The news was revealed at a Topping Out ceremony on Wednesday, marking the final stages of the venue’s £50m redevelopment which includes an enhanced guest and artist experience with improved green rooms and facilities, a new VIP entrance, as well as a new bar and restaurant space, set to open to the public in March 2024.
At the event, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham hailed the “exciting new phase” for the venue while Stockport band Blossoms marked the occasion by pressing their hands in cement.  
AO became the naming rights sponsor for the Manchester entertainment venue, which is operated by ASM Global, back in 2020 in what was a five-year deal. 
With the naming rights now extended, Burnham teased: “Maybe in this new era, we might even come to call it the AO Arena rather than the MEN [Arena]”
On the transformation he added it was an “exciting period” for AO Arena, showcasing Manchester’s status as the “global capital of music”.
“There is so much happening in Manchester, even more is going to be happening because of this. I want to thank everybody who’s played a part in making it happen. We’re proud of AO as a Bolton-founded company.”
After thanking construction partners for their role in the “major redevelopment”, he said the AO Arena will “forever be a part of the city and the city region’s story” adding that it’s “great to see it going into this new era.”
Since opening in 1995, the AO Arena has hosted the biggest names in live entertainment including U2, The Rolling Stones, Madonna, and Lady Gaga.
