The Batman 2 has been delayed by a year. The Robert Pattinson-led sequel is now slated for release on October 2, 2026. The movie was originally pegged for October 2025.
Warner Bros. announced the shift on Tuesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but did not offer an explanation for the push.
The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves, premiered in March 2022 and earned more than $770 million worldwide. In addition to Pattinson as Batman, the movie starred Paul Dano as The Riddler and Colin Farrell as Penguin. Zoe Kravitz played Catwoman, Andy Serkis suited up as Alfred, and Jeffrey Wright portrayed Commissioner Gordon. Barry Keoghan played Joker at the end of the film, presumably teeing up a bigger role in the sequel (though this is unconfirmed at this stage).
While fans will have to wait a while longer for The Batman 2, the spin-off series The Penguin with Farrell back in the role debuts later this year on Max. Additionally, Joker 2 with Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga is set for release in theaters this October.
The Batman 2 is being produced under the new DC Studios co-leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Unlike some of the other DC movie franchises that started before they took over in 2022, The Batman with Reeves and Pattinson is continuing. 
GameSpot's The Batman review scored it a 6/10. Reviewer Mason Downey wrote, "This is a Gotham that is both familiar and new, grounded and somehow completely bizarre. If The Batman has one major masterstroke that should be replicated in future live-action adaptations, this is it."
