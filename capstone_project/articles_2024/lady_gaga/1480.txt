Just before the summer of 1986, Tom Cruise starred in what would become the most popular film of the year: Top Gun. Decades since its release, the movie’s everlasting themes of fearlessness and true blue American ideals remain on the pulse of pop culture. Its legacy has only become further undisputable with the colossal success of . The record-breaking sequel earned $1.49 billion globally and received six Academy Award nominations, including the coveted Best Picture. 
Critics and audiences don’t often reach the same conclusion in modern cinema culture, but Top Gun seemingly transcends these limitations. Beyond its feat of getting people back in theater seats, the film series has permeated many other avenues of pop culture. 
Many will argue that the story truly compels audiences time and again, but much of Top Gun’s lasting impact comes from its masterful visuals. The special effects escape the dated designs of its contemporaries, and the costuming for every character has become definitive. Lt. Pete Mitchell, popularly referred to by his “Maverick” call sign, regularly donned bomber jackets and Aviators that the public quickly went to emulate. 
The Top Gun style became so mainstream that this look is still deemed fashionable in 2024, even outside military circles. At the time of its release, its impact brought about a revival of the Ray-Ban brand, with a 40% increase in Aviator sales following the first movie’s success. This would continue as Ray-Ban’s line of prescription sunglasses still includes the “classic” Aviator frame with its original design but updated with improved materials for color treatment, frame durability, and the ability to customize lenses with prescriptions, UV protection, and blue light filtering. With the 2022 sequel, Cruise returned in the iconic style (with a fresh supporting cast also sporting their own pairs) and once again made the Aviator one of the top-selling models of the summer. While Cruise famously has his pair custom-fitted for his nose bridge, moviegoers and fashion lovers alike are still able to get the exact Maverick pair by nabbing the Polished Arista Gold variant. 
There’s no question about Top Gun’s grip on the world of music, either. The first film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song thanks to Berlin’s “Take My Breath Away.” In the 95th Oscars, Top Gun: Maverick would be nominated for the same category, with Lady Gaga’s “Hold My Hand” ultimately taking home the win for Best Sound. 
A movie’s original soundtrack does wonders in setting its mood and serves as another vehicle to stay in an audience member’s mind long after the credits roll. The stunning hit-filled soundtrack and musicality used in both movies have resulted in the songs being streamed on music platforms to this day. The film itself has even influenced some of the most iconic musicians to grace the global stage. Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame inductee Jeff “Skunk” Baxter shared how his monicker was akin to the call signs adopted by the pilots in Top Gun. Where the on-screen pilot donned the name of Maverick, the legendary guitarist received his nickname as a call sign from his time working with the LAPD’s anti-terrorism efforts and in his continued high-level security clearance gig as a ballistic missile systems consultant for the US government. 
Military recruitment has long been a struggle, but the numbers have fallen drastically over the years. In 2023, the four primary military services in the US were unable to draft enough service members. This is why the Navy and Air Force’s recruiters banked on the positive reception of Top Gun: Maverick to revitalize numbers. It’s been a tried and tested method, as the first movie resulted in an increase in naval recruits. The sequel brought the same glitz and glam into the idea of joining the Air Force or Navy, without the usual bells and whistles that create a facade most would-be recruits frown upon.
