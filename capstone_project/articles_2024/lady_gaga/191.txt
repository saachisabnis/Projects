As the news of Donald Trump’s electoral victory spreads, a list of prominent celebrities, politicians, and public figures threatening to leave the United States has quickly emerged. From award-winning actors to iconic musicians, many have expressed their disapproval by vowing to relocate abroad if Trump returns to the White House.
High-profile personalities such as Alec Baldwin, Whoopi Goldberg, and John Legend, who have been vocal critics of Trump, are reportedly among those planning to leave. Social media buzzed with reactions as a list surfaced, detailing over 40 names of celebrities and public figures who claim they would rather live elsewhere than under a Trump administration.
Celebrities React: 'Ready to Leave the U.S.'
For several years, certain Hollywood personalities have publicly voiced strong opinions against Trump, with some even promising to emigrate if he were ever elected again. According to the list, popular figures like John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, and Rob Reiner are ready to pack their bags. Reiner, in particular, has taken a passionate stance, even going as far as reportedly vowing to "set himself on fire" if Trump assumes office.
Among the most notable promises on this list are music icons such as Cher and Barbara Streisand. Cher, known for her often fiery social media presence, allegedly declared that she would "blow her brains out" if Trump wins. These statements have been polarizing, with some fans offering support and others criticizing the dramatic responses as over-the-top and attention-seeking.
Other figures, like Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, and Lady Gaga, have long been active in their political advocacy, often calling for more progressive policies and condemning Trump’s stance on key issues. Their threats to leave are seen by some as a way to underscore their discontent with the potential direction of American politics.
Politicians and Activists Join the List
The list of those reportedly planning an exodus doesn’t stop with Hollywood stars. Politicians such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) are included as well. While these names are largely speculative, their inclusion has stirred significant debate over how deeply Trump’s election could impact the political and cultural landscape of the nation.
Prominent activist Dr. Anthony Fauci, who played a major role in the U.S. pandemic response, is also reportedly on the list, alongside philanthropist George Soros and tech mogul Bill Gates. For years, Gates and Soros have been outspoken about climate change, pandemic preparedness, and other global issues, often positioning themselves as counterpoints to Trump’s policies.
Speculation or Reality?
While the list has generated headlines, it remains unclear how many of these individuals are genuinely serious about relocating. Critics argue that these celebrity statements lack substance and serve merely as performative expressions, intended to gain attention or sway public opinion. Supporters, however, claim that the list demonstrates the deep divide in America and the extent to which Trump’s polarizing image affects various communities.
Online reactions have been mixed, with some Americans suggesting that such departures would bring about a cultural loss, while others welcomed the idea. The controversies surrounding celebrities’ vows to leave America are hardly new; similar threats were made during Trump’s first presidential win in 2016, though few followed through.
As Trump’s supporters celebrate his victory, all eyes are on these celebrities to see if they will indeed make good on their promises to leave. Whether or not Hollywood and political elites carry out their threats, the discourse illustrates the sharp divide in the country’s socio-political landscape.
In the weeks ahead, America will witness whether these prominent figures actually take the next steps toward an international move or if these statements are simply rhetoric. The country waits to see if this so-called “exodus” will become a reality or remain just another part of the celebrity spectacle.
