Lady Gaga has puzzled fans with her new look, with many hardly recognising the Born This Way singer. 
Gaga, 38, shared her transformation with fans, sporting dark brown hair and bleached eyebrows, a departure from her usual striking dark brows and platinum locks. 
The star is seemingly on vacation, with a scenic ocean view backdropping the snap. 
Sharing the selfie with her 56 million Instagram followers, the singer captioned it with a simple red rose emoji.
The Instagram has racked up nearly a million likes at time of writing, with many fans commenting on the photo to express their disbelief at how different Gaga looks compared to her usual self. 
Some fans even thought Gaga looked more like another star, with Rayvonmorris commenting: ‘Thought this was Julia Fox for a second lol’
Gluecksmarie_121 put the confusion more simply, writing: ‘Who is this?’
Lillic_07 suspected the photo portrayed a different pop star altogether: ‘I thought this was Halsey for a second lol both beautiful ladies.’
Lchristensen24 wrote: ‘Had to zoom in take a closer look. Wasn’t quite sure who I was looking at.’
Ptsumlin45 couldn’t even be convinced that it was truly a picture of the Judas singer, commenting: ‘That’s not Gaga.’
Despite the confusion and shock, many fans gushed about how much they liked Mother Monster’s new look. 
Maleahellison posted: ‘Black hair with the bleach brows is impeccable.’
Babygrubie agreed, writing: ‘The black hair bleached brows combo is SO GOOD 😍’
Gaga’s makeover comes amid ongoing speculation that the Grammy winner is engaged to her longtime boyfriend, entrepreneur and tech investor Michael Polansky.
The singer first revealed the news seemingly by mistake, introducing Polansky to French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal as ‘my fiancé’ during a memorable moment at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
In a TikTok video posted by Prime Minister Attal on Sunday, July 28, Gaga can be seen and heard introducing her beau as ‘my fiancé’ while the trio watched the Olympic swimming trials.
The news comes after the pair sparked engagement rumours in April after she was spotted wearing a large diamond ring, prompting fans to speculate.
Gaga is also set to star in the upcoming Joker sequel Folie à Deux as Harley Quinn alongside Joaquin Pheonix’s joker.
The Bad Romance singer takes on the role of the DC Comics character and Joker’s on-again, off-again girlfriend in the new film, which is said to be a musical.
Gaga’s new look may be in anticipation for the press tour surrounding the film, though she runs the risk that fans may not recognise her on the red carpet at all.
