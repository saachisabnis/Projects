Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” returns to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 this week after jumping up nine spots to reach No. 1. This is the festive classic’s 15th total week topping the singles chart, spread out over six holiday seasons. Christmas tunes dominate this week’s Billboard Hot 100, as Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” jumps up 13 places to No. 2, Wham!’s “Last Christmas” leaps 15 spots to No. 3, Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” bounds up 14 places to No. 5, and Burl Ives’ “A Holly Jolly Christmas” vaults up 23 places to No. 10. A week after claiming the entire Top 5 and seven of the Top 10, Kendrick Lamar places three songs in the current Top 10, with “TV Off” featuring Lefty Gunplay at No. 4, “Luther” with SZA at No. 6, and “Squabble Up” at No. 7. Shaboozey’s record-tying former chart-topper, “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” slips down two spots to No. 8, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” falls two slots to No. 9. (Billboard)
