The dream of owning a Birkin Kelly is only ever going to be that, thanks to the extortionate cost (yeah – an eye-watering £43,251, and that’s pre-owned!)
The chic and cult handbag has been seen on and owned by celebrities like Victoria Beckham, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez to name a few.
That being said, M&S shoppers think they’ve found a pretty good alternative to the OG named after Grace Kelly – not to mention a saving of £43,211.50.
The Faux Leather Top Handle Tote Bag that’s part of Marks and Spencer’s ‘Collection’ is a mere £39.50 and has all the components we love about the Kelly.
The versatile faux leather bag can be carried by the top handle, or worn across the body for a more casual, day-to-day look.

Best of all? You can adjust the long strap to achieve the perfect height on you – or remove it complete for the classic, Parisian vibe.
I mean just look at how sleek it is! Ever since we clapped eyes on it, we knew we had to treat ourselves to one asap.
We love the twist-lock closure on the front, and inside you’ll find two compartments plus a slip pocket – so everything can be organised neatly, just how we like.
Over 50 people have reviewed the item and have even mentioned how it ‘looks way more expensive than it looks.’
346ACE said: ‘Lovely just as the information said. Good size not too big and looks expensive,’ leaving the item the full five stars.
‘Lovely bag, small enough to look elegant, large enough to put all your essentials in. Looks more expensive than it was. Would highly recommend’ added Jan Rossrr.
Also available in a gorgeous ‘latte’ shade, some people have loved owning the one, they just had to get the other, with Deborah 53 saying: ‘I have the beige version of this bag and love the style and feel that I bought the black one’.
Naturally the item is selling fast in both shades, so if you fancy owning your very own Kelly-look-a-like, we suggest getting on into your basket asap.
And this isn’t the only time M&S have treated and our handbag collection to a gorgeous ‘alternative’.
Back in 2022, they launched the Faux Leather Cross Body Bag which sold out time and time again.
Many shoppers compared this to Celine’s Leather Crossbody Bag and seeing as some of the Metro own this exact bag, we’d have to be biased and say it’s better – no to mention £2,665 cheaper at just £35.
So what are you waiting for? This bag won’t be around for long so do as we’re doing, and getting one in your virtual basket asap.
