This special piece, adorned with 546 diamonds, reflects her unrivaled achievements and the nickname she has earned through her record-breaking performances. After clinching the gold, Biles remarked, “It is crazy that I am in the conversation of greatest of all athletes, because I just still think I’m Simone Biles from Spring, Texas that loves to flip.”
Hungary’s Boxing Association has lodged a formal protest with the IOC over Anna Hamori’s upcoming quarterfinal bout against Algeria’s Imane Khelif. Despite the protest, Hamori will proceed with the fight. The controversy stems from Khelif’s previous disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to unspecified gender eligibility issues, raising questions about fairness and eligibility.
