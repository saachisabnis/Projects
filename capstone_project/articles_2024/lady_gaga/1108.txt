It appears that Big Brother fans will be treated to their first big clash of the series in Tuesday's episode as Nathan and Daze are involved in a heated exchange about The Monarchy.
Nathan has already raised eyebrows among viewers after he revealed his support for Nigel Farage, as well as his history as a butler for King Charles.
And in the latest episode, the housemates are waking up in the Big Brother house for the first time, while those in storage face a full day of challenges to earn their place in the main house.
In Storage, Nathan spills the royal tea to Non-Housemates Lily and Emma about his time working as a butler for the King before Daze jumps in to share her opinion on the Royal Family.
Daze says, 'I don't really care about them, but I don't like the fact that we're paying for them…

'The fact that we're paying for them when everyone is like economically strapped. I feel like if they paid for themselves…'
Nathan jumps in and says: 'But do you not think they do?'
Daze responds, 'No they don't. They're like tourism thing is not as much as they're actually spending from the public body, it really just isn't… Like let them use their private wealth to take care of their very expensive lifestyle. 
'Like we've got so many poor kids who don't get to eat, we've got pensioners who can't afford their own fuel, like we can't… like those two worlds shouldn't be able to exist.'
Nathan questions Daze, 'But do you know the thing, generally it's the pensioners that actually are the biggest supporters of the monarchy… 
'But not everything is about money, sometimes tradition is quite nice…'
A few moments later in the conversation, Daze says, '…I'm not even against having a King or Queen or whatever, but I am against it when it's like literally we could be using that money to feed children who are actually starving. Like our schools are crumbling…'
Thomas contributes: 'I think it's a load of s**t, but I also think it's really important.'

Nathan replies: 'I think it's important and I think it's part of being… like I'm proud to be British and I think you all should be.'
Will Nathan and Daze be able to overcome their contrasting opinions or is this the start of a divide?
Viewers have already been making their feelings known about this year's lineup, and following Monday's show, were quick to brand Lily 'the most annoying housemate' of the series so far.
Just 48 hours into the new series Lily has already belted out Lady Gaga's Bad Romance at 3AM, snorted like a pig, and mocked her fellow contestants. 
The Chinese takeaway worker from Warrington, 20, who has already proclaimed that she fancies Thomas, seems to have spent most her time in the house winding up everybody else. 
Martha became the latest housemate to be ridiculed by Lily during Monday's instalment when she was seen waving an Alison Hammond sign in the air after Martha told her she was a big fan of the presenter. 
It came merely hours after she butted heads with Sarah after she was heard mocking her accent. 
Sharing their thoughts on X, fans of the show wrote: 'Lily is already testing my patience, how am i supposed to watch 6 weeks of her'; 'Sometimes I think I’d love to do Big Brother but then I remember I’d be trapped with people like Lily and my miserable self would be walking back out within two hours'; 
Viewers have already been making their feelings known about this year's lineup, and following Monday's show, were quick to brand Lily 'the most annoying housemate' of the series so far 
'Don't care if Lily is faking it. Don't care if Lily has absolutely no self awareness and is actually this annoying in real life. Just care that she's been in there for five minutes and is already sending everyone else over the edge'; Lily is so annoying I can’t handle 6 weeks of this.' 
'Lily is insufferable already. It’s not even been 48 hours'; 'I fear I too would be lying on the floor at 4.30am crying if Lily was screaming and waving an Alison Hammond sign around'; 'Nah Lily is stressing me OUT'; 'They’re already sick of lily and i don’t BLAME them at all'; 
'Lily has to be faking this, this can’t be how she does life 24/7. Surely she’s tired of herself???'; 'Can’t tell if Lily is annoying or iconic…'  
Lily admitted she had 'never heard' of Big Brother, and said she applied to appear on the show as it was her ex's favourite programme.
'When we broke up, I saw the advert and I thought I’m going to apply for his favourite TV show and get on it - I didn’t think I would. I also think it will be a cool experience'.
Asked why she would likely be nominated for eviction she quipped: 'Probably that I’m annoying but I don’t care'.
Before entering the house, she said: 'People's first impression of me is that I can sometimes come across as weird and annoying, and yeah, actually, that's kind of accurate. 
'I love tea, I literally have 20 cups a day, like no joke. If someone's messing with the old tea bags, I'm going to tea bag someone, no I won't do that, I don't have balls, but I'm going to do something, probably nothing.'

Big Brother fans were loving the show drama as it started early this year when two housemates clashed within hours of entering the iconic house on Sunday.
During the opening moments of Monday's show Lily and Sarah were seen already bumping heads as tensions brewed following the shock twist.
After being informed they were not real housemates and would be living in storage, 11 participants were all lumped together in incredibly uncomfortable surroundings. 
As a result Lily was seen mocking Sarah's posh accent, before Sarah, 27, broke down in tears after being 'overwhelmed' by the big brother experience. 
Taking to X fans said: 'Cracks already love it': 'Housemate beef already????': 'tears already': 'Sarah struggling, FFS it's been a few hours, just quit if it's so hard': 'Who had Lily and Sarah beef on their Bingo card for day 1 then?'.
