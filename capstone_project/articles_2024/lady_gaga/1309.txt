Jon Stewart tore into pollsters who predicted Kamala Harris would be crowned President of the United States. 
Just before word came in that Donald Trump became the 47th president of the United States, The Daily Show host slammed election pollsters. 
'It hasn't been completely called yet, we don't exactly know what all the results are gonna be. Our time is running out,' Stewart, 61, said. 
'I do want to very quickly send a quick message to all the pollsters, the election pollsters - blow me!
'I don't ever want to f***ing hear from you again. I don't ever want to hear "We've corrected for the over correction"... You don't know s*** about s*** and I don't care for you,' he added with a big smirk on his face as the audience applauded. 
Stewart's comments came just before Trump regained the White House, and after the 'Nostradamus of US presidential elections', Professor Allan Litchman, said he was certain that Harris would win. 
The Daily Show host Jon Stewart, 61, tore into pollsters Tuesday night just before Donald Trump was declared president 
On Wednesday, the 'Nostradamus of US presidential elections', Professor Allan Litchman, who said he was certain Harris would win, was left speechless as he watched Trump's victory
Litchman was heard saying: 'I don't get it' on his since-wrapped election livestream, as Trump's victory became clear. 
Lichtman, 77, has successfully predicted nine out of ten elections since 1984.
He was certain Kamala Harris would win, at first by a landslide, and then by a trickle.
But as Trump stormed to victory last night, Lichtman's miscalculation was unavoidable.
'I'm not doing any interviews, I'm done,' he said.
'Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow,' the 77-year-old who predicted a Trump win in 2016 continued. 
He then went full throttle against Trump, claiming the president won't see out his second term.
'You know what happens if Trump wins? He won't serve a full term, he'll turn it over to JD Vance,' he said, citing Trump's advanced age.
Trump took to the stage in West Palm Beach, Florida with his family and wife Melania and promised to usher in the 'golden age' of America
His son, Sam, appeared similarly stumped by the results playing out in real-time.
Lichtman thanked his fans for tuning in, before signing off for the night.
'I'm heartened from all the kind emails I've been getting, a lot of people say we should keep doing this show.
'I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow,' he added immediately after.
At several points, the seasoned professor appeared to grimace and cradle his face -as he tracked the results on-screen.
Just last month, Lichtman came forward to claim Harris had met what he believed to his critical objectives for victory - telling CTV News how his made-up metrics are 'based on a fundamental understanding of how American presidential elections really work. 
The forecasts raised eyebrows - as it had come from a man who has accurately predicted nearly every single US presidential election for decades. 
Still, Lichtman has been wrong in the past - albeit just once, in 2000, when he erroneously predicted a win for Al Gore.
In that case, part of the prediction did come true, in the sense that Gore snagged the popular vote.
However, this time around, that was far from the case.
Stewart went on to give viewers some reassurance as he ended his election night coverage with a plea to 'continue to fight.'
He also lashed out at pollsters and pundits, declaring: 'You don't know sh** about sh**'
The political commentator told his late night viewers, 'This is not the end', adding, 'we have to continue to fight', before Fox News called the election for Trump.
'We're going to make it seem like this is the finality of our civilization. We're all going to have to wake up tomorrow morning and work like hell to move the world to the place that we prefer it to be.'
'And I just want to point out, just as a matter of perspective, that the lessons that our pundits take away from these results, that they will pronounce with certainty, will be wrong. And we have to remember that.'
He then played a number of clips pointing out previous predictions of what America would look like following prior elections that didn't pan out, such as moving towards 'a post-racial America' following Barack Obama's election in 2008.
'Yeah, that lasted a day!' he quipped.
He then played a clip of a number of reporters saying Trump would leave Washington, D.C., a 'pariah' after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, and would 'never be allowed to step foot in the Capitol again. Never.'
'Ever,' Stewart exclaimed. 'My point is this: f**k!'
Stewart added: 'But this isn’t the end! I promise you, this is not the end.'
'And we have to regroup and we have to continue to fight and continue to work day in and day out to create the better society for our children, for this world, for this country that we know is possible. It's possible.'
Stewart's message came before Fox News called the election for Trump after the network declared he had won in Pennsylvania, leaving Harris unable to catch him
His message came before Fox News called the election for Trump after the network declared he had won in Pennsylvania to leave Harris unable to catch him.
Trump took the stage in West Palm Beach, Florida and declared victory in the early hours of Wednesday morning, cementing an extraordinary political comeback. 
'We made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is that we overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,' he said.  
'And it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing.' 
He told his supporters, 'every single day I will be fighting for you'.
Trump was joined on stage by members of his family and his wife, Melania Trump, as well as his running mate, JD Vance, and House Speaker Mike Johnson.
Vance briefly took center stage to describe Trump's victory as the greatest political comeback in history.
