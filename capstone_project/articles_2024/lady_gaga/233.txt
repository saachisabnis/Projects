Lady Gaga opened up about why she never addressed rumors that she was a man, explaining that she didn't want to perpetuate shame for others who might be facing similar accusations. The pop star revealed her reasoning in Bill Gates' new Netflix series, "What's Next? The Future With Bill Gates." Gaga shared that the rumor started in the 2010s after an altered image of her went viral online, but she chose not to address it directly to protect others. Fans praised Gaga for her bravery and empathy in handling the situation, emphasizing that her performances are the most authentic representation of herself.
