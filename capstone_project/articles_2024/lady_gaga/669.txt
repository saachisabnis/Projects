Happy Valentine’s Day from the Joker and Harley Quinn! To celebrate this Valentine’s Day, director Todd Phillips posted three images from his upcoming film Joker: Folie à Deux, the highly anticipated sequel to 2019’s surprise hit DC Comics film Joker, to his Instagram. In the caption, Phillips wrote, “Hoping your day is full of love. 10.4.24”.

The first photo shows Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, in his full clown makeup and red coat, standing across from Lady Gaga’s Harleen Quinzel in a simple blouse. The film is expected to be a twisted origin story for Lady Gaga’s Harley Quinn as she falls in love with her patient, the imprisoned Joker. In the comics and the animated series, psychologist Harleen Quinzel falls head over heels in love with the Joker, and ultimately becomes his sidekick and the Clown Princess of Crime in Gotham City. Folie à Deux is expected to be a more serious take on Harley Quinn’s origin story. 
The second photo shows the Joker, in his Arthur Fleck appearance, sans Joker makeup, rubbing noses with the smiling Quinzel. The final, striking photo shows the pair dancing on a rooftop in a classic, black-and-white style, with the Joker and Quinzel dressed to the nines. While none of these photos show Gaga’s character in her classic harlequin persona, Phillips revealed her makeup in a post from last April.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film is set to include romantic and musical elements that were not present in the first film, while still retaining the gritty drama that made Joker so unique amongst comic book adaptations. While it is unknown how much music will be present in the final version, with an artist and actress as prolific as Lady Gaga, it would be a shock not to see any. 
Joker: Folie à Deux is set to be released on October 4, 2024.
