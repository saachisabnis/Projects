Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” dashes back to No. 1 on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. The carol, released in 1994, leads the Global 200 for a record-extending 19th week and Global Excl. U.S. for a record-breaking 14th frame.

	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	










	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.
