Lady Gaga responded to rumors she's pregnant in a video shared to TikTok on Tuesday (June 5), silencing bold assumptions that populated the internet over the weekend. According to Billboard, rumors ran rampant after followers saw photos of the "Just Dance" songstress with partner Michael Polansky at her sister's wedding on Saturday (June 1). 
Fans thought Gaga was debuting a baby bump and began to question if the super star was pregnant. The artist was quick to dispel the rumors stating, "not pregnant-- just down bad crying at the gym" in reference to Taylor Swift track "Down Bad" featured on her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department. 
The video shows Gaga lip-syncing to a voice-over that says "I don’t have to find an aesthetic. I am an aesthetic. I mean I’m sure there’s somebody out here right now who’s going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me," as she shuts down rumors and encourages her followers to register to vote. 
Swift also had something to say about the opinions regarding the "Paparazzi" standouts body, and came to the icon's defense in the comment section of the video.
"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body. Gaga doesn’t owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman. 💋”
Gaga has been working on a few major projects over the last couple of months including musical sequel Joker: Folie à Deux, with Joaquin Phoenix (set to hit theaters this fall), and the Gaga Chromatica Ball concert film (released last month) in which she teased a new "musical era."
