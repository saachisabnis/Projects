Dare we say the new song is the big sister to "Bad Romance"? 
Lady Gaga is so back. 
After a four year hiatus from new solo music since the release of her last studio album, 2020's Chromatica, Mother Monster has returned. On Friday at midnight, the Grammy and Oscar winner released her highly anticipated comeback single "Disease", the first single off of her yet-to-be-titled seventh studio album, for now referenced by fans and the singer herself simply as "LG7". 
The song is classic Gaga in the best way possible, marrying elements of pop, rock, dance and rage with the star's signature lyrical ear-worms. Dare we say "Disease" is "Bad Romance's" edgier, (and more mature) big sister? 
"Disease" is the first taste of what's to come from Gaga's upcoming studio effort that she previously revealed will release in February of next year. The singer has shared tidbits about the creative process of crafting her new album in recent months, sharing earlier this year that the soon-to-be-released project is not like "anything that [she's] ever made before." 
 “I love to break genre, and I love to explore music," she said per Rolling Stone. "There’s something really beautiful about knowing that you will be loved no matter what you do. 
Ahead, read between the lines of Gaga's latest musical feat with the official lyrics below.
