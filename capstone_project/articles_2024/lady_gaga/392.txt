Wait, Matt Bomer with his hair slicked back and dressed to the nines as a 1930s movie mogul? Oh, hell yes, I’m totally all in.
Deadline reports the American Horror Story: Hotel star has just been tapped to star in an Amazon Prime series adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Last Tycoon. Set in Hollywood in the ’30s, Bomer is set to play the novel’s protagonist, Monroe Stahr, a studio executive who climbs to power and butts head with his mentor and head of the studio, Pat Brady.
Fitzgerald’s book mirrored the real-life doings in Hollywood at that time. Stahr is loosely based on film mogul Irving Thalberg, whose rise to power compromised his relationship with the great Louis B. Mayer, who the character Brady is based on. According to Deadline, the series will also get down and dirty, showing all kinds of violence, sex and whatnot, so there’s that to look forward to.
There was a previous big-screen adaption of The Last Tycoon in 1976, directed by Elia Kazan and written by Harold Pinter, and starring Robert De Niro. Yeah, this Bomer one is going to be WAY better.
First, though, we have to find out what happens to Bomer’s character on AHS: Hotel because right now, he’s heading into some trouble waters as he goes after his vampire maker, the Countess, played with surprising grace by Lady Gaga.
