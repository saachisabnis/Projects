Ready to learn the answers to today‚Äôs Connections puzzle? I give them all away below.
The yellow grouping is considered to be the most straightforward. The theme for today‚Äôs yellow group is SORE TO THE TOUCH and the words are: DELICATE, RAW, SENSITIVE, TENDER.
The green grouping is supposed to be the second-easiest. The theme for today‚Äôs green category is RESTAURANT COURSES and the words are: DESSERT, MAIN, SIDE, STARTER.
The blue grouping is the second-hardest. The theme for today‚Äôs blue category is ANIMAL HOMOPHONES and the words are: BARE, DEAR, MOUSSE, NEW.
The purple grouping is considered to be the hardest. The theme for today‚Äôs purple category is RED ___ and the words are: CARPET, DELICIOUS, MEAT, TAPE.
STARTER, DESSERT, MAIN, and SIDE are all meal courses. üü©
DELICATE, SENSITIVE, RAW, and TENDER are all synonyms for something that needs to be handled carefully. üü®
It looks like BARE could go with MOUSSE and DEAR because they are all animal homophones (bear, moose, deer) but I don‚Äôt know what completes the category yet.
If I go with that theory, that would leave DELICIOUS, CARPET, MEAT, TAPE, and NEW. Hmm, I‚Äôm not seeing anything.¬†
MEAT and TAPE could refer to materials that Lady Gaga has worn (the meat dress and her caution tape outfit) but that seems like a real stretch.¬†
Oh, wait, looking at the meat dress actually made me realize the category could be ‚ÄúRED ___‚Äù: red MEAT, red TAPE, red CARPET, and red DELICIOUS, referring to the apple. üü™
That leaves MOUSSE, DEAR, NEW, and BARE, which are apparently all animal homophones? üü¶ Hm, apparently ‚Äúgnu‚Äù is another name for a wildebeest. Love to learn.¬†
I have a full guide to playing Connections, but here‚Äôs a refresher on the rules:
First, find the Connections game either on the New York Times website or in their Games app (formerly the Crossword app). You‚Äôll see a game board with 16 tiles, each with one word or phrase. Your job is to select a group of four tiles that have something in common. Often they are all the same type of thing (for example: RAIN, SLEET, HAIL, and SNOW are all types of wet weather) but sometimes there is wordplay involved (for example, BUCKET, GUEST, TOP TEN, and WISH are all types of lists: bucket list, guest list, and so on).
Select four items and hit the Submit button. If you guessed correctly, the category and color will be revealed. (Yellow is easiest, followed by green, then blue, then purple.) If your guess was incorrect, you‚Äôll get a chance to try again.
You win when you‚Äôve correctly identified all four groups. But if you make four mistakes before you finish, the game ends and the answers are revealed.
The most important thing to know to win Connections is that the groupings are designed to be tricky. Expect to see overlapping groups. For example, one puzzle seemed to include six breakfast foods: BACON, EGG, PANCAKE, OMELET, WAFFLE, and CEREAL. But BACON turned out to be part of a group of painters along with CLOSE, MUNCH, and WHISTLER, and EGG was in a group of things that come by the dozen (along with JUROR, ROSE, and MONTH). So don‚Äôt hit ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù until you‚Äôve confirmed that your group of four contains only those four things.
If you‚Äôre stuck, another strategy is to look at the words that seem to have no connection to the others. If all that comes to mind when you see WHISTLER is the painting nicknamed ‚ÄúWhistler‚Äôs Mother,‚Äù you might be on to something. When I solved that one, I ended up googling whether there was a painter named Close, because Close didn‚Äôt fit any of the obvious themes, either.
Another way to win when you‚Äôre stuck is, obviously, to read a few helpful hints‚Äìwhich is why we share these pointers every day. Check back tomorrow for the next puzzle!
