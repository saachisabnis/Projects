During a new interview with the L.A. Times, Lady Gaga provided additional insight into her hotly-anticipated new studio album, which she and her fans have taken to calling LG7. While the recently-released lead single, “Disease,” was the first official taste of Gaga’s new sound, she shared that the true start to her current era dates back to her summer collaboration with Bruno Mars, “Die With A Smile.” Gaga said the Grammy-nominated Song of the Year represents a “huge part of my album,” which is expected to arrive in February. “The record is full of my love of music — so many different genres, so many different styles, so many different dreams,” Gaga shared. “It leaps around genre in a way that’s almost corrupt. And it ends with love. That’s the answer to all the chaos in my life is that I find peace with love.” (Rolling Stone)
