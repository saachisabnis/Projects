After being around for less than 20 years, the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, hosted its final event last fall, but the building has remained standing almost a full year later. What's the deal?
Costing a whopping $43 million, the Broomfield Event Center, later to be renamed the 1stBank Center, opened its doors in November 2006. With a capacity of around 6,000, it was the perfect mid-sized venue for sporting events, concerts, and more.
Over the years they had massive artists like Imagine Dragons, Green Day, Panic at the Disco, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Shawn Mendes, and so many more perform there. They were also home to the Rocky Mountain Rage CHL hockey team, and the NBA D-League basketball team the Colorado 14ers when they first opened.
Once those teams went under, the arena wasn't used enough and eventually cost the city of Broomfield more to keep it open than the venue was bringing in. Because of that, in May of 2023, the Broomfield Urban Renewal Authority's Board of Directors informed the community of the arena's permanent closure.
After sitting abandoned for nearly a year after its final event, we now know when, and how this once-popular venue will be demolished. The Broomfield City Council has instructed their staff to move forward with a "green demolition" of the arena, which is going to cost them just over $3 million.
Of the multiple options, this was the cheapest, and it will provide the opportunity to recycle certain materials as they demolish the building. The demolition, which is going to take roughly six months, is set to begin this fall per the Council's proposed timeline.
We still think it's a shame to have such a great building torn down, but clearly, we don't have enough apartments and homes in that area, so they need the room. Was my sarcasm strong enough through the keyboard? Check out these pics of the 1stBank Center during its final event last fall.
