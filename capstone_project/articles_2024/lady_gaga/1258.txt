With their solo and group work, BTS has solidified their status as top-tier, acclaimed musicians. While the K-pop supergroup’s music has captivated listeners around the world and set new records, it isn’t the only thing that has made them famous.
Jin, RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook have become huge global fashion influencers thanks to their gender-fluid, easygoing, and entertaining sense of style.
They have been signed as brand ambassadors by high-end fashion houses such as Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Dior, Celine, Cartier, and Valentino. In light of the upcoming Grammy Awards (February 4 (February 5, at 6:30 IST)), we thought it would be a good time to look back at BTS’s previous performance on the show.
Some of the most shocking and unforgettable moments in fashion have also taken place during the Grammy Awards, the biggest night in music. Additionally, BTS showed off how to liven up stodgy old tuxedos on the Grammys red carpet in 2022.

On the red carpet of an awards show, very few celebrities choose for anything other than a simple black tuxedo. Nonetheless, BTS sported tuxedos befitting their superstar status, continuing their trend of clothing that reflects their boundless glitz and easy cool. They walked the red carpet at the 2022 Grammys dressed in ultra-modern Louis Vuitton suits.

Although each member of the septet chose a unique modern tuxedo, they all managed to look great together. They were dressed in pants and jackets by Louis Vuitton. A lighter version of RM and V’s suits was Jin’s choice, in contrast to their matching colors. Suga and J-Hope matched their suits, while Jungkook matched Jimin’s.
Dark brown notch-lapel coats, straight-fitting jeans, purple collared shirts, and black boots were the outfits that V and RM settled on. In contrast to V’s front-button fastening, RM’s blazer had a double-breasted front.
As a finishing touch, he RM’d the suit with a sparkling encrusted gold brooch and a multi-colored floral pin-up. Similarly, Suga and J-Hope wore matching white outfits with brooches as their embellishments.
At the same time, Jungkook and Jimin sported blue jackets and pleated slacks, while Jin looked sharp in a brown double-breasted suit. In contrast to Jimin’s jacket, which featured a double-breasted closing, Jungkook’s blazer was cut short.
Afterward, the septet changed into black tuxedos for their electrifying performance of “Butter,” which garnered them a standing ovation from the audience and made for an amazing red-carpet appearance.
