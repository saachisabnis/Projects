The 2025 Coachella lineup is officially here, with the top of the bill  sporting a few millennial favorites and Coachella hip-hop veterans. 
Post Malone, Lady Gaga, Travis Scott and Green Day were announced by the festival on Wednesday as headliners and top guests. 
Post Malone’s recent Big Ass Stadium Tour announcement initially had a distinct lack of an L.A. date despite kicking off in Salt Lake City in April — leaving his schedule open for Indio. He later confirmed two Sunday night Coachella dates for April 13 and 20.
Post pivoted toward country on his latest album, “F-1 Trillion,” and recently played an all-country set at Coachella’s sister festival Stagecoach, though he’ll likely dip back into his catalog of festival-friendly hip-hop for this gig.
Rapper Scott was booked originally for Coachella’s 2020 edition, which was thwarted by the pandemic. After the Astroworld tragedy in 2021, where 10 fans were crushed to death while Scott performed, the rapper did not headline the fest’s return in 2022. He most recently performed at Coachella in 2017.
Other acts  picked for top slots include punk veterans Green Day, who have not played Coachella before (though singer Billie Joe Armstrong guested with the Replacements in 2014). They’ve been touring stadiums this year in support of their new LP, “Saviors.”
“Death, taxes and ... rock n roll,” singer Billie Joe Armstrong told The Times. “In this world gone sideways we know one thing for certain — rock ’n’ roll is forever, and its spirit is needed now more than ever. So bring your rage, your hope, and your loudest voice. Coachella, let’s have the time of our lives.”
Lady Gaga, also  selected for a top slot, last headlined Coachella in 2017. Gaga’s had a mixed year — her film “Joker: Folie à Deux” flopped badly (though her performance was broadly praised), while her new single, “Disease,” harked back to the trashy electro-pop of her early career and seemed to set things right with the faithful waiting for a new album.
Further down the bill, the avant-pop singer Charli XCX, a returned-to-touring Missy Elliott and goth-punk icons Misfits get prominent second billing. The fest will get a pair of solo shows from Jennie and Lisa of former headliners Blackpink; fresh-off-Camp Flog Gnaw sets from The Marías and DJ Mustard; sets from rising singer-songwriters Shaboozey and Benson Boone; and a solid slate of underground acts like electronic group Fcukers and hardcore band Gel. 
Interestingly, L.A. Phil music director Gustavo Dudamel will lead a first-of-its-kind performance from the orchestra in Indio — a fittingly glamorous curtain call before he leaves for the New York Philharmonic in 2026. 
Last year’s fest was headlined by Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, and Doja Cat. 
Coachella will return to the Empire Polo Club April 11-13 and 18-20. Passes are again on sale Friday, Nov. 22, at 11 a.m. PT, with a presale for 2023 and ’24 ticketbuyers starting Thursday, Nov. 21, at 11 a.m. PT.
