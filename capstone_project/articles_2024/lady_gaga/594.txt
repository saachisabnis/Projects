Valentine’s Day sparks one of the busiest shopping seasons of the year.
Though it might not inspire the masses quite like Black Friday, Valentine’s Day compels millions of people to find gifts for that special someone in their lives each February.
Any heartfelt gift can light up a sweetheart’s smile on Valentine’s Day, but certain items tend to be more popular than others on Feb. 14. Though Valentine’s Day shoppers can always go their own way when shopping for their sweethearts, some of the more traditional gifts remain wildly popular.
These go-to gifts maintained their status as the most popular items for individuals to show their love, according to industry surveys:
• Candy: Topping the list, 56% of survey respondents indicated they planned to buy candy for their sweetheart on Valentine’s Day. Though any candy can suffice, chocolates inside a heart-shaped box tend to be especially popular in mid-February.
• Greeting cards: Greeting cards will likely never go out of style, as 40% of respondents indicated they would give a card.
• Flowers: The appeal of a bouquet is undeniable, prompting 37% of shoppers to give flowers on Valentine’s Day.
• A night out: A romantic night out is perhaps as meaningful as ever. So it’s no surprise that 31% of respondents indicated they planned to take their sweethearts out for a night on the town.
• Jewelry: Though it might rank below the others on this list, jewelry remains a go-to gift on Valentine’s Day.
Stories of romance are as old as love itself. That makes Valentine’s Day an ideal time to indulge in a romantic comedy or classic love story.

Valentine’s Day is a bright light in the middle of the winter.
The origin of Valentine’s Day has generated much speculation over the years. Most early accounts do not point to heart-shaped boxes filled with chocolates. Rather, a few distinctive tales may paint the picture of early Valentine’s Day, and they have nothing to do with stuffed animals or romantic dinners.
One of the earliest records of the term Valentine’s Day is traced to the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which was a fertility festival. This annual event held on Feb. 15 included animal sacrifices and priests called the Luperci who would take pieces of animal hide and touch it to the foreheads of women in the hopes it would make them more fertile. Fortunately for the squeamish (and the sacrificial animals), Pope Gelasius I ended Lupercalia and replaced it with St. Valentine’s Day by the end of the 5th century.
Most people attribute the origins of Valentine’s Day to the holiday’s namesake, St. Valentine. But it seems that Valentine was the surname of a few different individuals. According to History.com, the Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus. One Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius II, who decided that single men made better soldiers than those with families or wives. Claudius outlawed marriage for young men. Valentine disagreed with the decree and would perform marriages in secret. Others believe it was St. Valentine of Terni, a bishop beheaded by Claudius II outside of Rome, who was the true namesake.
Yet another Valentine may have been jailed and fell in love with a jailer’s daughter while in prison. He purportedly wrote to her, beginning the first Valentine’s card or letter tradition. Other stories say the imprisoned Valentine actually was writing to a blind woman he purportedly healed, and signed the note “from your Valentine.”
It is hard to know who is who regarding the name Valentine, as the stories and the people behind them are used interchangeably. Some historians believe they are the same person rather than several Valentines, while others insist there were multiple martyred individuals.
However you slice it, the defiant actions of one or more people named “Valentine” set the course for centuries of romance to follow.
