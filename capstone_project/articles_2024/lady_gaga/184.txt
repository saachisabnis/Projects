Lady Gaga is no stranger to spooky TV, and she is set to make an appearance in the forthcoming, and highly anticipated, second season of Wednesday.
Variety confirmed that Gaga will appear in the Netflix series, which is currently filming in Ireland, and sources tell the publication that her role is currently unknown, but "it will be a cameo. Sources also say that the show's production team had a larger role in mind for the superstar, but "that ultimately did not work out."
Lady G has yet to publicly comment on her role in the upcoming season of Wednesday. However, she is no stranger to the show as her hit "Bloody Mary" went viral following the first season's debut as many used a version of the song to recreate Wednesday star Jenna Ortega's dance. When asked about the possibility of Gaga coming on board for the second season, Ortega told Variety during a pre-show for the Golden Globes, "I'm sure Netflix would love that."
Most recently, Lady Gaga shared her brand new single "Disease," and is set to appear in Joker: Folie Ã  Deux alongside Joaquin Phoenix. Gaga's other acting credits include A Star Is Born, starring opposite Bradley Cooper, House of Gucci with Adam Driver, and American Horror Story.
