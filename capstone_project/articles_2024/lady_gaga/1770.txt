Back in 2019, Joker made over $1 billion on a budget of just $60 million.
The arthouse gamble paid off for Warner Bros as the DC solo movie became the first R-rated movie to hit the milestone.
Add Joaquin Phoenix’s Best Actor Oscar win and it was only a matter of time before a sequel was announced.
Joker: Folie à Deux is set for release later this year with both director Todd Phillips and the star returning, alongside Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn in the musical follow-up.
And now the latest report is that the blockbuster’s budget has ballooned to $200 million, alongside news of the actors’ mammoth paydays.

Joker: Folie à Deux hits cinemas on October 4, 2024.
