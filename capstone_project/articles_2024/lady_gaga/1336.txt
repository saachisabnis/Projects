The highly anticipated film hits theaters Oct. 4.
Lady Gaga and her fiance Michael Polansky were all smiles as they stepped out for date night at the U.K. premiere of "Joker: Folie à Deux" on Wednesday.
The "Born This Way" singer, 38, wore a red dress with accentuated shoulders and makeup inspired by her character, Harleen "Lee" Quinzel -- aka Harley Quinn -- as she posed for photos at Cineworld Leicester Square in London.
Polansky wore a classic black suit for the event.
Elsewhere on the red carpet, Gaga also took photos with her co-star Joaquin Phoenix (Arthur Fleck) and the film's director, Todd Phillips.
The U.K. premiere of "Joker: Folie à Deux" comes one day after Gaga announced "Harlequin," a companion album to the highly anticipated sequel to 2019's "Joker."
The album will be released Sept. 27.
"Joker: Folie à Deux," which held its world premiere earlier this month at the Venice Film Festival, hits theaters Oct. 4.
