It was a big week for fashion sightings. The spring 2025 shows during Paris Fashion Week, for one, have served up plenty of A-list spottings—and mix in some big Hollywood premieres (Joker 2!) and the annual Albie Awards in New York City, and we suddenly had ourselves a celebrity-filled few days. The best dressed stars of the week? It was those who leaned into sculptural silhouettes; Whether it was mini party dresses or maxi evening gowns, the looks that stood out this week were those that put emphasis on shape.
In New York, Amal Clooney delivered classic glamour in a black column gown by Versace. The plunging neckline, however, made it feel superstar-worthy. A skin-revealing design was also embraced by Zoe Kravitz at the Saint Laurent show in Paris: The actor chose a black lace mini dress that was completely sheer—a sexier update to the classic LBD.
Voluminous frocks also took up space on the carpets—in the best way possible. At the BOF event in Paris, Ayo Adebiri wore a floral Loewe gown with a full bustle-style skirt. Ditto for Lady Gaga at the Joker 2 premiere in London: She chose a custom Celine ensemble including a red gown and puff-sleeved bolero jacket. We live for the drama of it all. Sorry, minimalism—sometimes extravagance wins.
