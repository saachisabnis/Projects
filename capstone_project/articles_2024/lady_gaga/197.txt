All eyes were on last night’s Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony as Celine Dion wowed the crowd and Lady Gaga performed on the Seine River – except not everything went to plan for the latter. 
The Bad Romance hitmaker, 38, performed a spirited rendition of Mon Truc En Plumes’ on a set of stairs wearing a big feathered pom pom on the back of a black leotard. 
She and the 10 dancers, decked out in custom Dior costumes, kicked, spun and leapt to the fast-paced French classic, in what was an electrifying performance to open the ceremony. 
However, after a rainy day in Paris, one of the dancers slipped and fell on stage mid-kick, as his pink pom poms could be seen dropping out of sight. 
Luckily, his recovery was pretty impressive, as the dancer leapt back up – looking a little bit perplexed at his fall – and carried on with the show as Gaga spun above the heads of his colleagues.
The House of Gucci star didn’t mention this incident in a post-performance message shared on social media, saying how ‘completely grateful’ she felt to have been asked to perform.

Taking to X, she wrote: ‘I feel so completely grateful to have been asked to open the Paris @Olympics 2024 this year. 
‘I am also humbled to be asked by the Olympics organising committee to sing such a special French song – a song to honour the French people and their tremendous history of art, music, and theatre.’ 
The Born This Way hitmaker explained how Zizi Jeanmarie, who was born in Paris a French ballerina, famously sang the track – which translates to My Thing with Feathers – in 1961. 
The pair crossed paths when Zizi starred in Cole Porter’s Anything Goes musical, which was Gaga’s first jazz release. 
She continued: ‘Although I am not a French artist, I have always felt a very special connection with French people and singing French music – I wanted nothing more than to create a performance that would warm the heart of France, celebrate French art and music, and on such a momentous occasion remind everyone of one of the most magical cities on earth – Paris.’ 
For the performance, Gaga and the dancers rented pom poms from French cabaret theatre Le Lido archive, which were made of ‘naturally moulted’ feathers. 
‘I studied French choreography that put a modern twist on a French classic,’ she explained. 
‘I rehearsed tirelessly to study a joyful French dance, brushing up on some old skills – I bet you didn’t know I used to dance at a 60’s French party on the lower east side when I was first starting out! 
‘I hope you love this performance as much as I do. And to everyone in France, thank you so much for welcoming me to your country to sing in honour of you – it’s a gift I’ll never forget! 
‘Congratulations to all the athletes who are competing in this year’s Olympic Games! It is my supreme honour to sing for you and cheer you on!! Watching the Olympic Games always makes me cry! Your talent is unimaginable. Let the games begin!’ 
Elsewhere Celine Dion, 56, took to the stage later in the evening with an emotional performance – her first since she announced her diagnosis with the neurological condition stiff-person syndrome (SPS) almost two years ago.
Dion had cancelled her Las Vegas residency due to health concerns in 2021, before revealing her SPS diagnosis in December 2022 and cancelling her Courage World Tour.
