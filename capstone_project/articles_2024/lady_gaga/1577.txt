A shy boy born in the hustle and bustle of Manila who found a new life in Yeovil is preparing to conquer the world karaoke scene. As the middle child of three siblings, Myron Jacob Osio navigated his formative years with a quiet reserve that masked a well of untapped talent. 
Now, at 36, Myron reflects on a journey that took him from the shy corners of his home to the luminous stages of the world, driven by a passion for singing that he discovered almost serendipitously.
With that passion, Myron is competing in the finals of Vocal Star Unsigned in Bournemouth on Saturday, August 10, against eleven singers from across the UK for an all-expenses paid trip to the world finals in Finland in the Karaoke World Championships. Last year, Ellie Butler took the trophy home for the UK.

Growing up in the Philippines, Myron admits to not having much of an identity during his early years. "I've always been a quiet, shy, and reserved person," he recounts. It wasn't until he stumbled upon his ability to hold a tune that he realised a passion for singing lay dormant within him.
"Funny enough, I used to be so afraid of microphones. I always thought they were going to take my voice away," he laughs, recalling his childhood fear. This discovery of his talent was a pivotal moment that set Myron on a path toward embracing his musical gifts.
The 1980s were a golden era for boy bands, and Myron was no exception to the craze. "I grew up listening to Westlife, Backstreet Boys, and other similar bands," he says.
These groups provided the soundtrack to his youth and fuelled his burgeoning love for music. Their harmonies and emotive performances laid the groundwork for Myron's own vocal style and aspirations. He moved to the UK from the Philippines with a desire to extend both his nursing and music career.
He adds: "I felt stagnant and I felt the need to broaden my horizon so I took the risk and I was fortunate enough to land a job in the UK. Looking back seven years ago, when I first came here, all I can think of is how proud I am of myself for what I have achieved so far in my music and nursing career."
While Myron's primary focus during his university years was a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, his passion for singing found an outlet through the university's chorale group.
"Joining that group was instrumental in honing my vocal abilities," he notes, crediting Vell Luis Litan, the choirmaster, with nurturing his talent.
"I am so grateful to have been mentored by such an amazing and talented person," he adds, emphasising the impact of this early mentorship on his career.
Today, Myron resides in the UK and continues to refine his craft with The Phoenix Voices and The Octagon Choir, both based in Yeovil. Directed by Kris Emmett and Adam Burgan, respectively, these groups provide Myron with a community of like-minded musicians and the opportunity to perform regularly.
Balancing a career in nursing with his passion for music has been a juggling act for Myron, but he remains steadfast in his commitment to both. "My singing career has not always been my number one focus because I have to concentrate on my nursing career," he explains.
Nonetheless, Myron seizes every opportunity to perform, whether it be with local choirs or at cultural festivals like London's "Barrio Fiesta," a massive Filipino cultural celebration.
Despite the challenges, Myron's persistence has yielded some notable achievements. A standout moment in his journey was auditioning for The Voice UK, a platform that, while not resulting in live show appearances, provided invaluable lessons and experiences. More recently, Myron reached the finals of Vocal Star
Unsigned 2023, placing in the top three and igniting a renewed determination to win the competition in the coming year. With a classical background, Myron is drawn to songs from the stage and screen.
"I enjoy singing musical pieces like those from Les Misérables and Phantom of the Opera," he shares, expressing a lifelong dream to perform the role of The Phantom in a West End show. This aspiration fuels his preparation for competitions and performances as he works tirelessly to perfect his craft.
Myron's journey in the Vocal Star Unsigned competition began serendipitously, discovered through a casual scroll on Facebook. The thought of sharing his talent on such a platform was irresistible, and he entered with enthusiasm. When he learned he had made it to the finals, his heart was filled with joy and determination.
"Knowing that this is going to be live and held at a fantastic venue, The Bournemouth Pavilion, my heart was overflowing with joy," he said.
As the finals approach, Myron is diligently preparing, training 4-5 times a week to ensure his voice is in peak condition. He recognises the importance of vocal rest and maintaining the right mindset to handle the pressure. His song choices for the competition reflect his passion and talent, aiming to showcase his vocal range and emotional depth.
The elimination round and final battle for the top three contestants loom large in Myron's mind.
"At first, I was so nervous when I learned about the format of the show," he admits. To combat this, he has devised a plan: "The first two songs, I will just give it my all and enjoy the third song if I get through the eliminations. I need to be calm and maintain the spirit of the competition."
Looking ahead, Myron dreams of representing the UK at the Karaoke World Championships in Finland, an opportunity that would be a dream come true. "It would make me so happy that my dream is finally becoming a reality," he says, his eyes alight with hope.
Winning the competition would be a significant milestone for Myron, both personally and professionally. "I grew up with insecurities and self-doubts, so winning this competition will help me realise that every singer has its own time to shine," he reflects. Professionally, it would propel him toward his goal of recording music and perhaps one day releasing his own album.
To aspiring singers, Myron offers sage advice: "Never stop chasing your dreams. You may experience trials and hardships, but those experiences hone you to become the best you can be. Keep the faith and never doubt your abilities. You have your own strengths, focus on them and use them to your full potential."
When not singing, Myron indulges in his love for baking and swimming, activities that provide balance and relaxation. "I love baking cakes, and I train six days a week at the pool to keep in shape," he says, underscoring the importance of maintaining physical fitness alongside his musical pursuits.
A humorous incident during a performance remains a fond memory for Myron. "I remember singing live, and the music book slid off and fell on the keyboard, making a horrific sound. I had to restart the whole performance," he laughs, acknowledging that the mishap helped ease his nerves for the second attempt.
Given the chance to duet with any artist, Myron's choice is clear: Lady Gaga. "I admire her artistry and craft," he explains, envisioning an unforgettable collaboration with the pop icon.
As he looks to the future, Myron remains steadfast in his commitment to singing and personal growth. "Whatever the outcome of this competition, I will never stop singing and chasing my dreams. I would strive to perfect my craft until I become successful," he declares, his voice brimming with determination. With plans to join another international singing competition in the US next year, Myron's journey is far from over.
