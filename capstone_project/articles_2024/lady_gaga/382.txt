A special holiday episode of Carpool Karaoke has debuted on Apple TV+ starring Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, and Chappell Roan. A Carpool Karaoke Christmas is hosted by Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, who drives the pop superstars around Tokyo, Missouri, and Los Angeles. They all sing along to holiday tunes and their own hits, like Gaga’s “Disease,” Lipa’s “New Rules,” and Roan’s “Pink Pony Club.” Roan was joined by her proud parents, Kara and Dwight Amstutz, during her segment, while Lipa took Lowe Christmas shopping in downtown Tokyo. AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson made a surprise appearance during Gaga’s segment, as the singers dueted on “Highway to Hell,” while Gaga revealed that she was in AC/DC’s “Stiff Upper Lip” music video. “I was 17 and I was an extra in the back,” she recalled. “I was headbanging and they were like, ‘hmmm. Don’t head bang, we want it to be modern.’ And I was like, ‘no, there’s only one move that I can do.'” (People)
