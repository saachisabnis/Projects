Good for Gaga that he thinks her performance is promising here. He deeply disliked HOG.
I agree.

 Boring? After Joker ended I wanted to see more of his character 
 Joaquin Phoenix played Crazy and Weird in almost all of his movies
 Visually, it looks pretty, but that’s about it 😕 
 Exactly
Joker 2 trailer reads like a fan service to me.
I think they’re really going away from the “character piece” that was Joker 1 and made it work for AMPAS. 
Doesn’t look like an above the line hitter. I’m thinking – Cinematography, Production Design & Sound. Thereabouts. 
BTW – they should trash the French subtitle before everyone chokes trying to pronounce it. Feels like they’re shying away from it anyway. Just call it Joker 2.

“One for Joker: Full Eye of Dicks, please.”
Oscar predicting is best when everyone tries to be really chill about it
“Hi! One for Joker: Full Eye A Dee Ucks, please.”
😂😝 this never even occurred to me…
 .. is MOTHER 
 I’m sorry “that’s entertainment” isn’t in the trailer

How was this fansevice? lol, the trailer was amazing, if you want to watch fanservice go an watch the Deadpool 3 trailer
OK let me watch this trailer as someone who hated Joker but I like Phoenix and Gaga otherwise.

If you like Joker then Joker 2 is for you. The fan of Joker. If you don’t like Joker then there’s nothing to see here (not even with the addition of Lady Gaga and musical numbers). 
Deadpool 3 can read like fan service too. 
It’s just interesting because Deadpool 3 won’t go into its campaign with “frontrunner” baggage. 
This Joker 2 trailer isn’t bad – if you enjoyed Joker. I didn’t. Trailer didn’t do anything for me. Some pretty cinematography I guess. 
I guess it’s never too early to find them haters.
Anyway, you’re not being honest if you still don’t have Gaga in your predictions

Deadpool 3 won’t be touched by the Academy even if its the best reviewed film of the year. If the 1st one didn’t happen when the novelty was exciting, why would a 2nd sequel to it (with the fanservice of bringing Jackman again) made any noise? DP3 is just another summer MCU film.
Joker is tailor made for them, it’s a sequel to a big event, it’s big and baity and they are on the radar for awards season, if you don’t have them at least in your top 10, then you are in denial.

Wow this movie looks great. Tech juggernaut along with Dune and maybe even Furiosa.
And damn. Not a fan music wise but Gaga does look great here. Very excited.
I think I’m in the minority that thinks the Furiosa trailers look… ugly?
