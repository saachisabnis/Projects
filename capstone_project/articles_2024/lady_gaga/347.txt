	Listen: you do not want to get on Kylie Kelce’s bad side. Remember when she screamed back at an unhinged fan (Page Six has screenshots HERE) who wouldn’t leave her and husband Jason Kelce alone while out to dinner? Exactly. She does not play around — especially not when it comes to her family. Her latest criticism is centered around one thing: every mom’s right to privacy. Kylie made a new video slamming people (and media outlets) who speculate and spread pregnancy rumors, and women everywhere are cheering her.

	In the TikTok posted earlier today, which has 1.2 million views, Kylie issued a trigger warning for pregnancy loss. The selfie video begins with Kelce addressing this sensitive issue. “I have kept my mouth shut on this for quite some time now, and my lack of filter’s kicking in,” she began. It’s OK, we love lack-of-filter Kylie!

	“I have had a number of articles written about me since the middle of last football season stating that I am pregnant,” she continues, as her kids Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 17 months, who she shares with Jason, play in the background. To be extra clear, she shakes her head and says, “I’m not,” adding that she hasn’t been pregnant since she gave birth to her daughter who is almost a year and a half old.



	The fact that she has to make a public statement that she isn’t pregnant makes my blood boil. It is nobody’s damn business if someone else is pregnant or no — we need to stay out of other people’s reproductive decisions!

	“I cannot stand people writing such insensitive articles about such a sensitive topic,” she continues. “Really lights my fire.” As it should! Kylie went on to vulnerably admit that she has experienced a miscarriage before her daughter Wyatt was born. She found out after going for an ultrasound and discovering there “was no heartbeat.” A few days later, she had to have a D&C (dilatation and curettage procedure to remove tissues from inside uterus).

	“I do not take getting pregnant or trying to get pregnant lightly,” she said, adding, “We need to just be in agreement that this is not a topic that anyone needs to be first on reporting. Let the parents say it when they’re good and ready.” Yes, Kylie, go off!!! We need more people speaking out about this, because it’s so humiliating and awful when someone asks about pregnancy and you are privately experiencing a loss or aren’t able to conceive for some other reason. You don’t know what anyone is going through, and there is no prize for guessing they were pregnant before they told you. Just mind your own business, keep your mouth shut, and trust that if someone is pregnant, they will let you know if they want to!



	In the caption, she added more details about her own experience dealing with pregnancy rumors. She wrote, “I have been congratulated in person multiple times. I have been questioned by strangers. Most aggressively, I was DM’d by a random woman asking ‘did you have a miscarriage?’ because one of the news outlets that said I was pregnant doubled back and claimed I hadn’t announced it because I had had a miscarriage.”

	“Let’s do better,” she added.
***Trigger warning: pregnancy loss. I have been congratulated in person multiple times. I have been questioned by strangers. Most aggressively, I was DM’d by a random woman asking “did you have a miscarriage?” because one of the news outlets that said I was pregnant doubled back and claimed I hadn’t announced it because I had had a miscarriage.    Let’s do better. 

	“You had me at ‘I can’t stand people’ 😂,” one person commented, which garnered 13.3k likes. Another joked, “you dropped this: 👑”

	“Swifties love us some Kylie Kelce!!” someone else wrote. “I have suffered from 10 miscarriages and 2 tubal pregnancies. Your grace for others is rare.” Another wrote, “You are so right! I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the insensitivity knows no bounds. Thank you for speaking out❤️”

	“We ride with you Princess Kyana!!” someone else said.

	Taylor Swift, who is dating Kylie’s brother-in-law Travis Kelce, has had her fair of pregnancy speculation throughout the years as well. She recently slammed people who comment on women’s bodies in a TikTok comment defending fellow pop star Lady Gaga, who was rumored to be pregnant.

	The “Bad Romance” singer first shared a video telling fans: “Not pregnant — just down bad cryin’ at the gym.” The “Down Bad” singer responded, “Can we all agree that it’s invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body. Gaga doesn’t owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.”

	Swift has previously shared in her Miss Americana documentary how comments speculating on pregnancy used to trigger disordered eating for her, which is just another reason you don’t realize how damaging your words can be.

	Even if you’re right, guessing someone’s pregnancy can still be harmful. You just stole the joy and delight that comes from announcing the news to friends and family in their own time. In the words of Queen Kylie, “Let’s do better.” 
These celebs were quick to shut down pregnancy speculation.
