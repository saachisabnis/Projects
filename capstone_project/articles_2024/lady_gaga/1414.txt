Francine Maisler, casting director for the upcoming Joker sequel Joker: Folie á Deux, sat down with interviewers at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and discussed the newest film in the Joker universe. During this, Maisler discussed the casting of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn and how the star’s acting in the film was “really surprising.”
 
“She’s so good in it, you guys. She’s going to blow your mind…I didn’t suggest Lady Gaga. It wasn’t my idea. That was Todd Phillips, before me. But I will tell you, she’s really surprising — and really good. I saw it and I was really surprised. I mean, we all knew what she could do in ‘A Star Is Born,’ but I thought, ‘Oh, well, that’s kind of in her wheelhouse.’ Something she could do and just be real. But this… Man, she’s good,” Maisler stated according to Deadline. 
 
Gaga will star in Joker: Folie á Deux alongside Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The movie’s prequel, Joker, came out in 2019 and got Phoenix the Best Actor award at the Oscars in 2020. The sequel will be written and directed by Todd Phillips and produced by Warner Bros. 
 
This will not be Gaga’s first time on the big screen as the pop star starred in various documentaries, consisting of her and other artist’s concerts. She also has acting credits in Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller’s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and Bradley Cooper’s remake of A Star is Born. For this film, Gaga got her own Oscar for Best Original Song for “Shallow.” 
 
Joker: Folie á Deux will be in theatres on Oct. 4.
