You're never too young to become a fan of the immensely talented singer and songwriter Lady Gaga.
While you may have already introduced the kid in your life to her incredible music — because the dance-worthy beats of Poker Face and Bad Romance have no age limit — now, with the help of Golden Books, you can share her story and rise to fame with them too. 
Released on January 2, 2024, Lady Gaga: A Little Golden Book Biography is now on sale at Amazon for just $5. 
Starting with Stefani Germanotta's early career and her transformation into Lady Gaga and continuing with her journey to become an award-winning actress, this illustrated biography covers it all.
$6 $5
Each page of the 24-page picture book biography tells the story of Stefani Germanotta and features colorful illustrations showing the different stages of Lady Gaga's rise from a shy performer whose mother pushed her to attend open mic nights in New York City to the award-winning singer, actress and performer she is today.
Little Golden Books is no stranger to telling the story of our favorite stars. Other Little Golden Books biographies feature Beyoncé, Simone Biles, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. When Taylor Swift's Little Golden Book was released last year, it quickly sold out so we recommend securing your Lady Gaga biography while you can.
While the Little Golden Book biographies are technically geared toward young children, we think any fan would want this true tale on their bookshelf. Buy a copy for your little one or yourself today.
