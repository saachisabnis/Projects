Gaga ooh la la!
The one and only Lady Gaga was in York, Maine over the weekend, for a very special event, attending as maid of honor for her sister, Natali's wedding.
The paparazzi were out in full force, as were several weekend tourists, wondering what all the fuss was about.
Gaga, who is also known by her real name, Stefani Germanotta, was there with her entire family, who pretty much shut down the View Point Hotel for the rehearsal and ceremony.
They made a great choice! There are sunny, picturesque views of Nubble Point, as you can see from the videos of the event.
During a break from all the festivities, she made a stop at Dunne's Ice Cream, for a chocolate walnut cone, surprising the owner, Steve Dunn in the process.
Dunne respected her privacy, by not posting about it on the ice cream shop's social media accounts, but he did say that he had a brief chat with the pop star, commenting:
“She said it was nice to be a normal person here in York, Maine,”
In case you were wondering, during the wedding, she wore a peach-colored, chiffon gown, from her very own Topo Studio label.
She was spotted with her boyfriend, Michael Polansky, and made more headlines over last weekend when she had to shoot down pregnancy rumors, which she addressed in a TikTok video.
