In 2021, Lady Gaga’s three French bulldogs—Asia, Gustav, and Koji— were on a walk and the latter two were kidnapped after her dogwalker Ryan Fischer was shot. The pop star, who was filming House of Gucci in Italy at the time, had offered a $500,000 reward “no questions asked” to those who returned the dogs. The dogs were returned by Jennifer McBride, who was later revealed to be involved in the kidnapping of the dogs. Three men and two accomplices were arrested for ties to the kidnapping. 
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 2021, Gaga called Polansky and her dogs her “whole life” after the kidnapping, “Everybody’s OK,” Gaga said at the time. “Everybody’s healing. I pray for Ryan all the time. I’m so grateful that we did not lose him. And every day I thank God for the safe return of my dogs.” She continued, “My dogs and the man that I love are my whole life.”
