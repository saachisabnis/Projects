Kendrick Lamar not only has the number one album in the country, but the number one song, with his latest single, “squabble up” dethroning Shaboozey‘s hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 

	After holding the record for an impressive 19 weeks — tying Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” for the longest Hot 100 chart-topper —  K. Dot’s latest single has taken over the No. 1 spot, followed by “tv off” (No. 2),  “luther” (No. 3) “wacced out murals” (No. 4) and “hey now” (No. 5). “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” was forced down to No. 6, followed by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With A Smile” at No. 7. Kendrick re-enters the top 10 with “reincarnated” coming in at No. 8 and “Man At The Garden” at No. 9 while Mariah’s classic “All I Want For Christmas Is You” has found its way to the No. 10 spot. 

	










	Not only does Dot rule the singles chart, but his album has also taken the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s 200 chart, with his surprise album GNX amassing 319,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. during the week ending Nov. 28, according to Luminate. 

	Of the album’s total units, 285,000 came from streaming equivalent albums (SEA), translating to 379.72 million on-demand official streams of the album’s 12 songs. The album also accounts for the third-biggest streaming week in 2024, following Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department, which posted 891.37 million and 428.54 million streams in its first and second weeks, respectively.
