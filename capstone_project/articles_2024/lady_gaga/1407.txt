It's no secret that the The Simpsons has an uncanny ability to predict the future, and now, one of the show's biggest stars is sharing why she believes that is.
Nancy Cartwright, who has been the voice of Bart Simpson for the last 35 years, told Page Six that the "predictions are a numbers game." She explained, "This is just my opinion. I think it’s a numbers game. You have twenty plus writers, and they just think of these ideas that you go, ‘That would never happen.’ It’s like blackjack or it’s like poker. It’s just a numbers game." She added, "Who knew Trump would be President, again! It’s like, wow!"
Cartwright also said of the show's writing, "A writer is somebody that observes life. They see what’s out there and again, with the internet there are so many ideas that are available. Somebody will hook onto something and next thing you know, they hook it into a show!"
The Simpsons have been right about many world and pop culture events, including Donald Trump being elected president, Super Bowl wins, an underwater submersible emergency event (OceanGate), smart watches, Seigfried and Roy's tiger attacks, Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance, and so much more.
