Cyndi Lauper took part in her Hand and Footprint ceremony at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
The ’80s music icon donned a sleek all black look for the special occasion, sporting a blazer over a corset top, cropped trousers and platform pumps. Lauper slipped into a pair of glossy black patent leather heels with no back to hold the foot in place, ideal or an event that calls for the removal of one’s shoes. The slide-on style featured a peep-toe design with a platform that looked nearly 2 inches high and a towering stiletto heel.

 









The shoes, while unconfirmed, look just like Pleaser’s Delight 601 silhouette, which retail at under $50. Pleaser’s affordable platforms are popular with various celebrities, most notably Lady Gaga and Gwen Stefani. Kate Beckinsale, Kim Kardashian, Billie Eilish and Jennifer Lopez have also worn different styles courtesy of Pleaser Shoes. Janelle Monae even wore clear Pleaser platform heels to the 2024 Met Gala.
