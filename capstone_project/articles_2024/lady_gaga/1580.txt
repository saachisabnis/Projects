Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan and Dua Lipa all appear in the new holiday edition of Carpool Karaoke that’s streaming on AppleTV+. Although each singer’s segment was filmed in a different city, there’s a connection between two of them that Gaga couldn’t help but notice.
In Chappell’s segment, she shows host Zane Lowe around her parents’ farm in Missouri, pointing out a chicken that her father named Lady Gaga, because he’s a “huge Gaga fan.” 
When a fan posted that clip to TikTok, Gaga saw it and commented, “An honor, truly.”
Naturally, fans are now calling for the two artists to collaborate.
By the way, Chappell’s family also has chickens named after all the Spice Girls, as well as rock pioneer Little Richard.
