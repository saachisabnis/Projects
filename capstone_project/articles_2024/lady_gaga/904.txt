Lady Gaga is an artist who has never been afraid to shine a spotlight on her worst moments. She readily sings about breaking down, insecurity, addiction, and more. That kind of candor is what appeals to her audience. It’s a refreshing artistry that few of her peers can boast. 
One of her most candid songs is “Marry The Night.” This track, featured on Born This Way, sees Gaga battle her demons. Judging by the triumphant energy of the song, it seems she survives that battle. Uncover the meaning behind “Marry The Night,” below.

I’m gonna marry the nightI won’t give up on my lifeI’m a warrior queenLive passionately tonight
I’m gonna marry the darkGonna make love to the starkI’m a soldier to my own emptinessI am a winner
“Every song on all my albums has some relationship to New York City, but one in particular, ‘Marry the Night,’ that record is about my husband New York,” Gaga once said. 
At face value, this track seems to be about reveling in a wild night out in New York, but there are some implications behind that idea that seem to uncover a deeper meaning. Lyrics like I’m gonna marry the dark and I’m a soldier to my own emptiness point to a sadness in Gaga that is threatening to boil over. 
Many fans have come to attribute this song to Gaga’s battle with insecurity, addiction, and recklessness. In the second verse, she seems to be gearing up for something. She laces up her boots and stands tall. But, in the same breath, she calls herself a loser and a sinner. There certainly seems to be an inner-struggle there. 
What is so appealing about this track though is its universal application. Anyone struggling can latch onto this song and heal through it. That’s the magic of Gaga’s music. Her discography is a place to heal and grow alongside the singer herself. 
Revisit “Marry The Night,” below. 
I’m gonna lace up my bootsThrow on some leather and cruiseDown the street that I loveIn my fishnet glovesI’m a sinner
Then I’ll go down to the barBut I won’t cry anymoreI’ll hold my whiskey up highKiss the bartender twiceI’m a loser
