This complaint follows a federal court of appeals ruling that the First Amendment applies in school libraries 
(New York, September 26, 2024)— Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishers, and Simon & Schuster, alongside The Authors Guild, filed a renewed challenge today to the book removal provision in Iowa Senate File 496. This is one of two lawsuits that the coalition has brought challenging school library book removal mandates. On August 29, the group, along with Sourcebooks, filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida challenging the unconstitutional book removal provision in Florida House Bill 1069. 
Also joining in this challenge are the Iowa State Education Association (ISEA) and four renowned authors whose books have been removed in Iowa school and classroom libraries—Laurie Halse Anderson (Speak and Shout), John Green (Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars), Malinda Lo (Last Night at the Telegraph Club and A Scatter of Light), and Jodi Picoult (Nineteen Minutes). Additionally, this complaint includes new plaintiffs: two educators and a high school student. 
While the State of Iowa initially defended the ban by arguing that the First Amendment does not apply to school libraries, this argument—known as the “government speech doctrine”—was squarely rejected by the 8th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals prior to this filing.

At Hachette Book Group:
Hachette Book Group CEO Michael Pietsch said, “It’s been a full and exciting first half at Hachette. We launched a new ecommerce-enabled website, moved our NYC Workman colleagues into our midtown headquarters, Moon Travel celebrated their 50th anniversary with a festive gathering in Berkeley, and Orbit launched its new digital publishing imprint, Orbit Works. Our authors enjoyed major honors including James Patterson becoming the first author to tally 100 million books sold on Bookscan, Walter Mosley receiving the Crime Writers’ Association’s Diamond Dagger, Michael Connelly being named a Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America, Ira Wallace winning the James Beard Leadership Award, and Jefferson Cowie winning the Pulitzer for History for Freedom’s Dominion.
The ebbing of the pandemic lift that began in the second half of 2022 continued for HBG into 2023’s first half.  We were happy to see sales growth from bookstore chains and independent bookstores, our downloadable audio program continued its strong positive trajectory, and travel book sales grew significantly. But sales of backlist titles, children’s and Christian books, and general and prescriptive nonfiction faced particular challenges in a down market. Cost-reduction measures we began in 2022 mitigated the profit impact of our revenue decline versus 2022’s dynamic first half.
Backlist sales began to grow toward the end of the first half and we anticipate a considerably stronger second half, with continued strength from our adult fiction programs, our market-leading travel books from Rick Steves and Moon Travel, and TikTok-promoted nonfiction and fiction. Our third quarter brings exciting nonfiction including Thomas Sowell’s Social Justice Fallacies, Gary Kasparov’s The World After Ukraine, Bernie Taupin’s Scattershot, Kerry Washington’s Thicker Than Water, Joyce Meyer’s Blessed in the Mess, Leslie Jones’ Leslie F*cking Jones, and Ross Gay’s The Book of (More) Delights. Fiction highlights include Ntozake Shange’s Sing a Black Girl’s Song, Peter Brown’s The Wild Robot Protects, Grace Lin’s Chinese Menu, Thrity Umrigar’s The Museum of Failures, James Patterson and Mike Lupica’s 12 Months to Live, and Robert Galbraith’s The Running Grave. And for the youngest readers, we have Indestructibles: Elmo Says Surprise, the first in our new Sesame Street partnership, and My First Brainquest: Feelings and Opposites coming in September.

Bruce Nichols, publisher of Little, Brown and Company, proudly announces a dramatic memoir and urgent warning, OATH AND HONOR: A Memoir and a Warning by former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Little, Brown and Company acquired world rights and expects to work with partner publishers around the world to bring this book to the widest possible international audience. Nichols will edit. Cheney was represented by Robert Barnett of Williams & Connolly. OATH AND HONOR is slated to publish November 14, 2023.  To protect our nation and preserve our freedom, the framers required the President and all members of Congress to swear a solemn oath to the Constitution. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump and many around him, including other Republican officials, intentionally breached that oath: they ignored the rulings of dozens of courts, plotted to overturn a lawful election, and provoked a violent attack on our Capitol. In this book, Cheney will tell the story of this perilous moment in our history, those who helped Trump spread the stolen election lie, and the risks we still face.

Lagardère announced their 2022 full-year revenue and profits today. Hachette Book Group CEO Michael Pietsch said, “Hachette Book Group’s revenue in 2022 was up from 2021 thanks to the acquisition of Workman Publishing, and declined slightly from last year’s peak like for like. Especially strong sales for Verity by Colleen Hoover, Run, Rose, Run by Dolly Parton and James Patterson, and The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, and in our Audio and Third-Party Distribution businesses, helped offset lower backlist sales and a decline in the hardcover format. Despite strong sell through and careful cost management, 2022 profits were lower than 2021’s high levels due to sharply rising manufacturing and freight costs. Highlights for the year included #1 New York Times bestsellers from Kwame Alexander, David Baldacci, Jennifer Lynn Barnes, Holly Black, Michael Connelly, Elin Hildebrand, and Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child, among others. And our authors received major honors – a Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a James Beard Award for Melissa Martin, National Book Critics Circle awards for Clint Smith, Rebecca Donner, and Jeremy Atherton Lin, a Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Clint Smith, a Grammy Award for John Lewis, and a Nobel for Svante Pääbo.

At Hachette Book Group: Hachette Book Group CEO Michael Pietsch said, “2022’s first half was solid, with revenues ahead of 2021 thanks to Workman joining us and a rise in trade paperback and downloadable audio sales, high backlist sales, strong sales in independent bookstores and in Canada, and continued growth in our third-party distribution business. Like for like, revenues were down very slightly due to a lighter release schedule.  Profits remain strong but below 2021’s extraordinary results due to sharply rising costs in paper, manufacturing, and shipping. Results were buoyed by the success of Dolly Parton and James Patterson’s Run, Rose, Run, the best-selling new hardcover of 2022, and continued strong demand for Colleen Hoover’s first suspense novel, Verity.  We’ve also had #1 bestsellers from David Baldacci, Kelly Barnhill, Harlan Coben, Vashti Harrison, Elin Hilderbrand, James Patterson, David Sedaris, Tom Segura, and Nicholas Sparks. And our books and authors have received significant honors this year, including the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Dr. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein’s The Disordered Cosmos, James Beard Award for Melissa Martin’s Mosquito Supper Club, Barnes & Noble’s Children’s and YA Book Award for Christopher Denise’s Knight Owl, and Chautauqua Prize for Rebecca Donner’s All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days.

Basic Books, an imprint of Perseus Books, a Hachette Book Group company, announced today that it has acquired four new books by award-winning historian Martha S. Jones, the author of Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All (Basic Books, 2020). Jones’s next book offers a profound and powerful reassessment of racial identity in the United States by centering the history of slavery’s sexual violence and its legacies. Braiding history and memoir, Jones grapples with her own family’s story across five generations and two hundred years–not only as the child of a white mother and a Black father, but also as the great-great granddaughter of a Black woman named Isabella Holley and the white man who enslaved and raped her. Lyrical and deeply personal, the book reckons with what it means to be marked by and to bear the legacy of sexual violence. In the process, it will transform how we understand Black biracial and mixed-race identities, colorism and so-called light skin, “passing,” and the very idea of race itself. Subsequent books include a manifesto on the role of history in America’s ongoing racial reckoning; a family history that provides a major new account of the Black women’s Atlantic world out from the Haitian Revolution and across the nineteenth century; and a landmark new biography of U.S. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney that emphasizes his consequential relationships with Black Americans across his lifetime.

Grand Central Publishing is excited to announce that Jamie Foxx’s book, ACT LIKE YOU GOT SOME SENSE: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me, will be published on October 19, 2021. Suzanne O’Neill, VP, Executive Editor of Grand Central Publishing, acquired North American rights to the book from Anthony Mattero at CAA. The book will be published simultaneously in hardcover, e-book and an audio edition, read by the author, by Hachette Audio. Jamie Foxx is not only an actor, comedian, and musician, he’s also starring in his most humbling and long-running role yet as father to two independent girls: Corinne and Anelise. While his daughters have very different views on the world, there is one thing they can agree on: Dad gets on their motherf***ing nerves. Though every day with his girls brings hurdles and hilarity, he’s learned a lot along the way. In ACT LIKE YOU GOT SOME SENSE—a title inspired by his beloved and fierce grandmother—Jamie reveals his rocky parenting journey through priceless stories about the tough love and old-school values he learned growing up in the small town of Terrell, Texas; his early days trying to make it in Hollywood; and life after achieving stardom. You would think being an A-lister would ease his dad-duty struggles, but if anything, it has only made things more complicated. It seems that a teenage girl who just wants to blend in with her friends will not be excited to see her dad’s flashy new convertible at the front of the carpool lane.

Grand Central Publishing is excited to announce the acquisition of HOOKED: How Crafting Saved My Life, a memoir and crafting book by Tony Award winning actress Sutton Foster. Suzanne O’Neill, VP, Executive Editor of Grand Central Publishing, acquired North American rights to the book from Mollie Glick at CAA. The book will be published simultaneously in hardcover, e-book and an audio edition, read by the author, by Hachette Audio on October 12, 2021. Whether she’s playing an “aging” book editor on television or dazzling audiences on the Broadway stage, Sutton Foster manages to make it all look easy. How? Crafting. From the moment she picked up a cross stitch needle to escape the bullying chorus girls in her early performing days, she was hooked. Cross stitching led to crocheting, crocheting led to collages, which led to drawing, and so much more. Channeling her emotions into creations centered Sutton as she navigated the significant moments in her life and gave her tangible reminders of her incredible experiences. In HOOKED, Sutton shares those moments, including her fraught relationship with her agoraphobic mother; a painful divorce splashed on the pages of the tabloids; her struggles with infertility; the thrills she found on the stage during hit productions like Thoroughly Modern Millie, Anything Goes, and Violet; her breakout TV role in Younger; and the joy of adopting her daughter, Emily. Accompanying the stories, Sutton has included patterns, recipes, and so much more!

Mary Ann Naples, VP and Publisher of Hachette Books, announced today the forthcoming publication of THE QUEEN BEE (Hachette Books, 11/02/21), by Lil’ Kim, with Kathy Iandoli. The embargoed book is edited by Associate Editor Carrie Napolitano, who acquired World English rights in a deal with Robert Guinsler of Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc., and will be available in hardcover, eBook, and an audio edition by Hachette Audio. When teenager Kimberly Denise Jones—better known as Lil’ Kim—burst on the hip-hop scene in the mid-nineties, no one was prepared for how she would shake-up the entire music industry. As the sole female member of the Notorious B.I.G.’s rap collective, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and an affiliate of Puff Daddy and the Bad Boy family, Lil’ Kim always stood out from the pack. But she was determined to make an even greater name for herself and emerged as a solo superstar. In 1996, she dropped her solo debut album, Hard Core, which topped the Billboard charts, went double-platinum, and is now widely considered to be one of the most influential rap albums of all-time. With her dynamic lyricism, her unflappable no-nonsense attitude, her iconic looks both on and off the red carpet, and her unapologetic sexuality, Lil’ Kim quickly established herself as a force to be reckoned with—and was crowned the Original Queen Bee.

Lagardère announced results for First Half 2020 today. Highlights of the company’s financial performance are as follows: At Hachette Book Group: Hachette Book Group CEO Michael Pietsch said, “HBG’s first-half revenues held, declining only slightly despite the vast business challenges of the pandemic.  Especially strong performances came from the Orbit division with The Witcher novels, fueled by the successful Netflix series, and Little, Brown, with continuing sales of Malcolm Gladwell’s 2019 bestseller Talking to Strangers. Unit sales grew over last year, with an increase in sales of lower-price formats such as mass-market paperbacks, ebooks, and downloadable audio largely offsetting decreases in adult hardcovers and trade paperbacks.  During the pandemic, the work of our warehouse team to keep our books shipping has been remarkable, and our marketing and publicity groups have nimbly reinvented the ways we connect writers with readers. The fact that the massive retail disruption caused by the pandemic did not impact revenues significantly demonstrates the enduring appeal of books, the benefits of our multi-outlet, multi-format business, and the deep attachment readers have to Hachette’s authors.  Readers need books and will seek them out in many places even when favorite independent and chain bookstores are closed.  We have worked closely with independent bookstores to help them reopen, with an extensive offer of special terms.

Sales were bolstered by the publication of Malcolm Gladwell’s Talking to Strangers, by continued growth in downloadable audio, and by a strong program of adult thrillers.  HBG had 55 New York Times bestsellers in Q3 2019 including four titles at #1 – Malcolm Gladwell’s Talking to Strangers, Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch, David Baldacci’s One Good Deed, and Elin Hilderbrand’s Summer of ’69. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start, with newsworthy books such as Ronan Farrow’s bestseller Catch and Kill and intense anticipation for A Warning by Anonymous, on sale November 19.  Our #1 bestsellers so far this quarter include The Night Fire by Michael Connelly, A Tale of Magic by Chris Colfer, The 19th Christmas by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro, and Shea Serrano’s Movies (and Other Things). We were thrilled at the news that PublicAffairs authors Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, with their new book Good Economics for Hard Times to be published on November 12. We are looking forward to a strong finish to the year, with rising holiday sales of the bestsellers above, a large and lively slate of conservative political books including Triggered by Donald Trump Jr., and new books from many of our most exciting authors, including James Patterson’s dual laydown Criss Cross and Ali Cross, David Baldacci’s A Minute to Midnight, Holly Black’s The Queen of Nothing, Joel Osteen’s The Power of Favor, and Flea’s memoir Acid for the Children.   And we are looking forward to welcoming a new Publisher for Hachette Nashville, Daisy Hutton, who arrives November 11 and will oversee the Christian and conservative publishing programs at FaithWords, Worthy, and Center Street.”

We are committed to publishing this annual report on our progress toward the goals laid out in our environmental policy. Download the full report here. Reducing Climate Impacts We are continuing to optimize wherever possible to reduce our carbon footprint, with an annual reduction goal of 2.5% for the 2017–2020 period. In 2018, HBG’s carbon footprint grew by 5%, due primarily to carbon heavy paper stock needed for several of our 2018 titles. This was offset by carbon improvements in the following areas: significant decreases in business travel and in mailing out of our New York and Boston offices, and improvements in electricity usage in our Boulder location. Increasing Certified and Recycled Fiber In 2018, our FSC (Forest Stewardship Certified) fiber usage exceeded 97.6%, stable compared to 2017.  Combining FSC and SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative), 100% of HBG’s overall paper usage in 2018 came from certified fiber, exceeding our combined FSC/SFI goal of 95%.

With the publication of The Legends of Greemulax, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers makes available the original middle grade fantasy adventure novel featured in Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

The Legends of Greemulax will simultaneously release in hardcover and ebook.
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt offers a unique brand of humor to viewers while also dealing with tough topics sensitively, and we’re thrilled to give fans another avenue to immerse themselves in Kimmy’s world with The Legends of Greemulax,” said Jacobs. “In her completely delightful debut novel, Kimmy tackles pertinent gender stereotyping concerns for kids with enough adventure, comedy, and heart to make the lesson go down easy for readers of all ages. We couldn’t be more pleased to welcome her to the Little, Brown Books for Young Readers author list.”
“To paraphrase a great commercial, ‘I can’t believe I wrote-uh da whole thing!’” said Schmidt. “I really hope my book reminds everyone that the world is still good, like when your mystery lollipop flavor is raspberry, even though it sometimes feels disappointing and scary, like when your mystery lollipop flavor is banana.”

Reagan Arthur, Senior Vice President and Publisher of Little, Brown and Company, announced today that Little, Brown has acquired North American publication rights to Malcolm Gladwell’s new book, Talking to Strangers. The book is scheduled for publication on September 10, 2019. Gladwell was represented in the negotiation by Tina Bennett of William Morris Endeavor. Little, Brown Vice President and Executive Editor Asya Muchnick will edit the book. Talking to Strangers is Gladwell’s first book since his #1 bestseller David and Goliath was published five years ago, and after the launch of his enormously popular podcast, Revisionist History, entering its fourth season later this year. Gladwell’s new book offers an incisive and powerful examination of our interactions with strangers—and why they often go wrong. How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn’t true?

Goodnight Bush, Origen and Golan’s inventive send-off of the Bush administration, became an instant bestseller. Time called it “hilarious, clever, very relevant, remarkably insightful, and thought-provoking,”Salon described it as “ingeniously illustrated and garnished with trenchant social commentary,” and USA Today praised the authors for their “laugh-out-loud yet sophisticated wit.”

Mauro DiPreta, VP and Publisher of Hachette Books, announced today the forthcoming publication of LET ME FINISH: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics (Hachette Books, 1/29/19), by former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Written with Ellis Henican, the book will be edited by Executive Editor Paul Whitlatch, who acquired North American rights in a deal with Mel Berger of William Morris Endeavor, and will be available in hardcover, eBook, and an audio edition by Hachette Audio.
For more than a decade, Chris Christie has been among the nation’s most prominent political figures—a household name, thanks to his canny instincts and in-your-face brand of politics. A 2016 presidential candidate, Christie became one of President Donald Trump’s earliest and loudest supporters—and very nearly became Trump’s vice president—only to find himself unceremoniously booted from the Trump transition after the election.
In LET ME FINISH, Christie will set the record straight about his dismissal—and what really went down in 2016 and 2017—revealing candid and surprising insights into the public and private Trump, drawn from fifteen years of close friendship, as well as Trump’s inner circle and Christie’s own political ascent, by turns triumphant and tumultuous.

The Seventh Star, the laconic, unflinching memoir by Swifty McVay, Detroit-based rapper and member of the legendary hip-hop group D12, will be published by Hachette Audio in original audiobook format on July 10, 2018.
Read by the author himself, listeners will embark on a journey that takes them from Swift’s intense childhood on Detroit’s notorious West 7 Mile, to the highs and lows of fame that he and his peers experienced as D12 rose to national prominence. Fans of hip-hop and rap will listen rapt as McVay pulls back the curtain to describe the familial connection between D12 members, including their initial mixed reaction to a then little-known young rapper named Marshall Mathers III (aka: Eminem).
ButThe Seventh Star is more than a typical music memoir. It’s a story told with raw immediacy, about the significant struggles McVay faced and overcame — including the bleak and brutal deaths of group members Bugz and Proof — as D12 rose through the ranks. Anchoring himself in sobriety and spirituality, McVay continues to challenge himself to this day, as he tells listeners the intimate story of finding his voice and continuing to share his music’s message from America’s heartland.

New York, NY – May 11, 2018
Reagan Arthur, Senior Vice President and Publisher of Little, Brown and Company, announced today the upcoming publication of Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents, by Pete Souza, the Chief Official White House Photographer for President Obama and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Obama: An Intimate Portrait. Michael Szczerban, Executive Editor of Little Brown and Company, acquired North American rights from David Black, of David Black Literary Agency. The book is slated for publication October 16, 2018.
When Pete Souza left the White House in 2017, he didn’t know what it meant to “throw shade”—but he started doing it almost immediately on his personal Instagram account, posting his photographs from the Obama years with captions that vividly define the contrast between the Obama White House and President Trump’s administration. Media organizations caught on and couldn’t stop talking about Souza’s posts, with New York magazine calling them “a master class in shade,” CNN describing them as “a silent, social media, shade-throwing protest told in visuals,” and Politico naming him “King of Instagram Shade.” Souza’s following on Instagram has since grown to nearly two million people. He has also become a potent force in American life, offering incisive political criticism alongside powerful reminders of the best our country has to offer.
Shade is a portrait in contrasts, telling the tale of two presidencies through a series of powerful visual juxtapositions—with Souza’s unforgettable images of President Obama delivering new power and meaning when framed by tweets, headlines, quotes, and other material from the first 500 days of the Trump administration. The book responds to fan demand for a book that captures Souza’s voice on Instagram, and will include more than one hundred photographs that did not appear in his previous book. More than a sharp compendium of clapbacks, Shade is a touchstone to an era of greater integrity in our politics. Souza’s work is a stirring reminder of the highest American values we share, giving us the courage to stand up and speak out for what we believe in.
Reagan Arthur said, “We could not be more delighted with the success of Pete Souza’s number one bestseller Obama: An Intimate Portrait—and we’re thrilled to be publishing his new book of extraordinary photographs and commentary just before the midterm elections this year. In addition to throwing shade, this book shines a light on the presidency and on our individual roles as citizens, reminding each of us how much our votes and voices matter.”

Reagan Arthur, publisher of Little, Brown and Company, announced today the acquisition of Ronan Farrow’s new investigative book Catch and Kill, which will continue his award-winning reporting on sexual misconduct and the machine deployed by powerful men to silence survivors of abuse and threaten reporters chasing those survivors’ stories. With original reporting and stunning revelations,Catch and Kill will tell in full, for the first time, the hidden story of how far private investigators, former spies, high-priced lawyers, and embattled executives went to terrorize, intimidate and silence the women whose stories helped launch an international conversation on sexual misconduct and the abuse of power. Little, Brown acquired World English rights from agent Lynn Nesbit of Janklow & Nesbit, and the book will be edited by Executive Editor Vanessa Mobley. Publisher Reagan Arthur says, “Ronan Farrow’s wrenching investigative journalism has given voice to sexual abuse survivors and shaken the conscience of our culture. But, despite the enormity of the conversation his reporting helped ignite, some of the most astonishing disclosures about what he uncovered are still to come. We’re very proud to be publishing this important book.” Catch and Kill comes after Farrow’s year-long investigation into Harvey Weinstein, which resulted in the publication of the first allegations of rape and sexual assault against the Hollywood producer in The New Yorker, as well as Farrow’s subsequent exposés about Weinstein’s attorneys, private investigators, and co-conspirators in the media. Those explosive stories exposed “long-suppressed allegations of coercion, brutality and victim silencing and helped spur a worldwide reckoning about sexual abuse of women,” and were awarded the Pulitzer Prize gold medal for Public Service—the first ever awarded to a magazine—the George Polk Award for National Reporting, and the National Magazine Award for Public Interest. Farrow has since continued his groundbreaking investigative reporting on other prominent figures accused of abuse, including President Donald Trump and the former Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned hours after Farrow and Jane Mayer reported on allegations of misconduct against him.

Priest Literary Agency.  The first book–Run Away–will be published in hardcover and e-book editions in March 2019. Run Away is about two parents facing the unthinkable: the all too common nightmare of their beloved daughter’s descent into addiction and her subsequent disappearance, the murder of the girl’s deadbeat boyfriend, and the suspicions of the police that a vengeful father committed the crime. As these powerful forces push in on the couple, they remain focused on the only thing that matters—bringing their daughter home, no matter what the consequences. Coben said, “It’s a thrill to be reunited with my former long-time editor, Ben Sevier, and I’m looking forward to working with the entire Grand Central Publishing team.” Sevier, who edited Coben’s ten consecutive #1 New York Times bestsellers between 2007 and 2017, said of the acquisition, “I’ve known Harlan Coben for two decades, first as a fan and then as his editor and publisher.

Grand Central Publishing (GCP) is excited to announce the acquisition of the much-anticipated second novel – IMAGINARY FRIEND – by acclaimed author, screenwriter, and director Stephen Chbosky.  IMAGINARY FRIEND will be published in hardcover print, e-book and audio editions in the Fall of 2019. Ben Sevier, Senior Vice President and Publisher of GCP, and Wes Miller, Senior Editor at GCP, acquired North American rights from Eric Simonoff at William Morris Endeavor, with Miller tapped to edit the book. Rights have also been sold to Orion in the UK and to Calmann-Levy in France. Further deals have been made in Germany, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Romania, Sweden, and the Netherlands with offers and auctions ongoing in Greece, Israel, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. IMAGINARY FRIEND is a wildly ambitious, sweeping work of literary horror that focuses on Kate Reese, a single mother fleeing an abusive relationship by starting over in a new town, with her young son Christopher. Her world begins to unravel after Christopher vanishes into the Mission Street Woods – where fifty years earlier an eerily similar disappearance occurred.  When her son emerges six days later unharmed but not unchanged, he brings with him a secret: a voice only he can hear and a warning of the tragedy to come to the real world if he fails to protect it.  Soon Kate and Christopher find themselves in the fight of their lives, caught in the middle of a war playing out between good and evil, with their small town as the battle ground. Of his new novel, Stephen Chbosky said, ““Do you remember when you were a little kid and you would look up into the clouds?  Remember how the clouds would look like the shape of a dog or a tree or a face?  Well, what if you were a little 7 year old kid now?  With a single mom.  And no money.  And what if you couldn’t help but notice that for the last two weeks, you looked up into the clouds, and it was always THE SAME FACE staring back at you?  That is the origin of my story.“

Lagardère announced financial results for the third quarter today. See highlights below: 
At Hachette Book Group:CEO Michael Pietsch said, “Thanks to energetic summer and early fall sales for numerous titles, growing downloadable audio sales, and strong performance from our third-party distribution clients, HBG’s revenues through Q3 are solidly ahead of 2016.” Bestselling books for the period include Michael Connelly’s The Late Show, James Patterson’s The Store and Haunted, Seeing Red by Sandra Brown, The Land of Stories: Worlds Collide by Chris Colfer, Al Franken’s Al Franken: Giant of the Senate, and The Identicals by Elin Hilderbrand. Orbit author N.K. Jemisin received a Hugo Award for The Obelisk Gate, the second year in a row she has taken that prize, and Grand Central Publishing has a National Book Award finalist in Fiction, Min Jin Lee’s gorgeous immigration saga Pachinko. Many of HBG lead fall titles are off to fast starts, including Sisters First by Barbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Bush Hager, Obama: An Intimate Portrait by Pete Souza, Hacksby Donna Brazile, Michael Connelly’s Two Kinds of Truth, and Joel Osteen’s Blessed in the Darkness; and we have exciting books to close out 2017 from David Baldacci, James Patterson, Neil Patrick Harris, Elin Hilderbrand, Cressida Cowell, and many others. To date this year, 143 HBG titles have hit the New York Times bestsellers list, including 28 #1 bestsellers. HBG has 125 USA Today bestsellers to date, with 9#1s.
At Hachette Livre: For the first nine months, Hachette Livre delivered revenue of €1.665B, up 1.2% like-for-like over the same period in 2016 (up 1.5 % on a consolidated basis). The difference between these two figures reflects a €27M positive scope impact resulting from the acquisitions of Perseus Books, Brainbow, Bookouture, and IsCool Entertainment, and a €31M negative foreign exchange effect related to the depreciation of the pound sterling.  Through September 30, publishing division highlights were Partworks (up 9.3%) and Hachette Book Group (up 2.2%), which offset the anticipated decline at Hachette UK due to unfavorable comparison with the hugely successful Q3 2016 publication of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. In the third quarter, Hachette Livre delivered revenues of €646M, down 2.1% like-for-like and down 4.3% consolidated.
