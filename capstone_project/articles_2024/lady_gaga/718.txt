Lady Gaga reflected on the past speculation about her gender identity and addressed her deliberate approach to those rumors during an interview on Netflix’s What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates. “I went all over the world,” she said. “I traveled for tours and for promoting my records and almost every interview I sat in – there was this imagery on the internet that had been doctored – they were like, ‘There’s rumors that you’re a man. What do you have to say about that?’” Gaga discussed her nonchalant responses to these questions, explaining that she “didn’t feel like a victim with that lie” and didn’t want to fuel potential shame for those who might face similar rumors. Now she’s used to the frequent “misinformation” about her. “I’ve been used to lies being printed about me,” Gaga said. “I’m a performer. I think it’s kind of funny.” (Variety)
