Good Grief! Vandals cut the head off a Snoopy statue last month, and local businesspeople in St. paul, Minn. are asking for its return. They say the statue, called "Stargazing," cannot be repaired without the head in time for an Oct. 1 auction.
It's part of the summer-long "Peanuts on Parade" tribute to the late Charles Schulz that put 101 5-foot-high, polyurethane Snoopy statues in various locations in St. Paul, the city where the cartoonist grew up.
Jane McClure, spokeswoman for the North End Business Association, said if the head is returned by Saturday, the group will not pursue criminal charges.
The association also is offering a reward of up to $500 for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of the vandals.
No matter what happens to "Stargazing," the rest of the statues will be sold off in two auctions to raise money for three causes: a permanent bronze tribute to Schulz, an endowed chair of illustration at a St. Paul college, and scholarships at the Minneapolis correspondence school where Schulz studied and taught.
The statues are expected to fetch between $1,000 and $5,000 apiece.
