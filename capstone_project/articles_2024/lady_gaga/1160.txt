	While discussing their new film A Complete Unknown with Billboard, Timothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning bounced around from Bob Dylan’s lyrics to Nicki Minaj’s legacy, Doechii’s rising stardom and a shared love for Mariah Carey’s music.

	At the heart of the Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, directed by James Mangold, is the singer/songwriter’s early rise in Greenwich Village between 1961 and 1965 — a time when his words became rallying cries for a restless generation. For Chalamet, stepping into Dylan’s well-worn boots wasn’t a task he took lightly. He learned more than 40 Bob Dylan songs, not just to perform them, but to fully absorb their meaning. “It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, as an actor, just as a human. The metaphor I use… I am a huge Kid Cudi fan from my teenage years, right? And that’s the music that shaped me going into my adulthood. Into my adulthood, Bob Dylan shaped my worldview and his music — except at the end of that path, I’m embodying him.”

	










	It was an unexpected comparison, but one that makes perfect sense. For a lot of people who grew up in the era of streaming playlists and viral music moments, Cudi’s lyrics became a sort of survival toolkit for navigating emotional turbulence. Dylan, in his own era, wasn’t so different: He wrote songs that made people feel seen, whether they were marching in protests or simply trying to make sense of their lives. 

	While Dylan’s music served as the foundation for his performance, the conversation seamlessly opened up to Billboard’s Top Female Rappers of 2024 list. Nicki Minaj secured the No. 3 spot, and Chalamet’s face immediately lit up. “I feel like as a LaGuardia grad, as a Barb — even if I get roasted saying that… maybe have to slot Nicki [hand gestures upward] — but I’m not gonna disagree with that. I don’t need to wade into those waters.”

	The LaGuardia reference, of course, ties back to his roots in the performing arts school known for producing fiercely passionate performers. And let’s be honest: The image of a young “Timmy Tim” rapping Nicki Minaj lyrics is almost too good to handle.

	But it wasn’t just Chalamet bringing the music references; Fanning held her own in the musical conversation too. Her connection to Dylan predates the film, and she shared how she was introduced to his music while working on a movie with Cameron Crowe at just 13 years old. “I do not know all the facts of Bob [Dylan], but I was just a lover of his music. I was 13, Cameron Crowe introduced me to his music, I did a film with him [We Bought a Zoo], and he would play his songs all the time.”

	










	There’s something inherently cinematic about that moment: a teenage Fanning being guided into Dylan’s world by a director synonymous with rock ‘n’ roll storytelling. 

	Fanning’s music taste isn’t limited to classic folk anthems; it thrives in the current moment too. As soon as we mentioned Billboard’s Top Female Rappers of 2024 list, her excitement was instant. She didn’t even wait to hear the full lineup before confidently declaring Doechii as her top pick (she landed at No. 6 on our list). “I got to see her perform… I got to meet her actually. She is beautiful, like I am obsessed with her.”

	The conversation then took one final detour: astrology. As a fellow Aries to Fanning, Billboard‘s Cat Johnson couldn’t resist bringing up some of the most iconic Aries musicians: Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin and Elton John. When asked to pick her favorite Aries legend, Fanning didn’t hesitate: “Mariah is Mariah, like I love Mariah Carey.”

	Beyond the fandom moments and Barb confessions, what stood out most about this conversation was how deeply both Chalamet and Fanning respect the music that shaped their roles. For Chalamet, learning Dylan’s songs wasn’t just preparation; it was an education. For Fanning, music became both anchor and an entry point into the world her character occupies.

	This isn’t just another music biopic. A Complete Unknown feels like a love letter — to artistry, to rebellion, to the intangible power of music to move us, change us, and remind us who we are. Whether you’re a Dylan purist, a Barb, or someone who’s just stumbled upon Doechii’s music on your For You page, this film feels like it could speak directly to you.
