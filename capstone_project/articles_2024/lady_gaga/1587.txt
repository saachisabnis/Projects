It's been five years since Joker stormed the box office making over $1 billion on a budget of just $70 million.
Joaquin Phoenix reprises his Oscar-winning performance with Lady Gaga joining him as Harley Quinn this time around.
Joker Folie à Deux has been rated R in the US (the same as the first movie) which roughly translates to a 15 in the UK.
The reason for the classification is for "some strong violence, language throughout, some sexuality, and brief full nudity."
And now the first audio of Gaga's Harley has been released with her uttering the words: "You can do anything you want. You're Joker."
NOW has slashed the price of its popular Entertainment and Cinema Membership to just £9.99. That's half price for an entire month. This amazing deal includes hundreds of live channels and on-demand boxsets plus movies. There's even seven days of free Boost which allows you to watch on more devices and in full HD quality. Perfect!

Additionally, the first trailer for Joker 2 is set to debut at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on April 9, which will be April 10 for the UK.
Presumably, this means that it will arrive online in what will be the early hours of that latter date for British fans on BST.
Joker Folie à Deux hits cinemas on October 4, 2024.
