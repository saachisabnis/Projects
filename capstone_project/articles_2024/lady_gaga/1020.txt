As expected, the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony was a flashy affair. Lady Gaga performed on the steps of the Seine, paying homage to French dancer and actress Zizi Jeanmaire with a dazzling, feather-filled rendition of “Mon Truc en Plumes.” Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf’s beautiful “L’Hymne à l’amour” while wearing a shimmery Christian Dior gown. And the Eiffel Tower itself was aglow from a truly magnifique laser show.
Aly Raisman clearly got the message: Her outfit for the event shined bright like the City of Light. In particular, she wore a pair of eye-catching custom Stuart Weitzman sandals adorned with red, white, and blue Swarovski crystals. “I’ll always cherish wearing these shoes for such a memorable time in my life,” she tells ELLE.
The fashion moment was also a major milestone for the retired gymnast and two-time Olympian. Having served as the team captain of both the 2012 “Fierce Five” and 2016 “Final Five” U.S. women’s gymnastics teams, helping lead both squads to win team gold medals, she’s now in Paris as a commentator and to support the 2024 gymnastics team as a fan.
Believe it or not, it was also her first time going to the opening ceremony. Despite competing in both 2012 and 2016, she had previously never attended due to scheduling conflicts and other Team USA obligations. “I wanted to look and feel at my best,” she says.
In addition to her Stuart Weitzman Nudist II sandals, Raisman wore a strapless Carolina Herrera silk dress with oversized bow details. The gown is from the an upcoming Chalet 2025 capsule collection, and will not released until November.
Below, Raisman takes ELLE along as she gets ready for the 2024 Paris Olympic opening ceremony.
Which one do you think I picked for opening ceremonies?
The winner!
Nothing better than the Nudist heel and a red dress.
The man himself, Stuart Weitzman, gave me one of the best pieces of advice I have ever received: He told me not to let my gymnastics career be the highlight of my life. Full circle moment to be in Paris reflecting on my career and this next chapter wearing his custom shoes.
Taking a moment to reflect and look back on my career and what the opening ceremony means to me.
I don’t think I packed enough shoes…!
Before competing, I always took my time getting ready because putting makeup on and doing my hair was therapeutic. It’s a reminder for me to check in with myself and see how I am feeling.
Sharing shoes with my mom is girl math.
Red was always one of my favorite colors to compete in!
