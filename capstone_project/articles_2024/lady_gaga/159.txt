Zodiac Bar has established itself as the go-to queer cabaret bar in North London. But did you know Zodiac is both a bar and a club? Club Z is in the basement, with its own entrance, and is now set to make an impression following the launch of several new nights this spring.

Look out for more nights at Club Z over the coming weeks. Zodiac welcomes all queer tribes and we’ve been promised a really broad based, all welcome, collection of interesting and entertaining nights. 
You can’t beat a night dominated by the greatest pop royalties Madonna and Lady Gaga! Z-DJ Miles and the House Collection will be playing their greatest hits and remixes all night long. It will be a night to remember!
Club Z opening hours: Wednesday 5 pm – 1 am, Thursday 5 pm – 2 am, Friday 5 pm – 2 am, Saturday 5 pm – 2 am.
Club Z is at 119 Hampstead Road, London NW1 3EE, United Kingdom.
