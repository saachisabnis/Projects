Jade Jordan is a UK and conversion manager at Add People, a digital marketing agency based in Altrincham. 
She joined the agency back in 2018 as a content and SEO specialist before rising through the ranks to her current role in 2022.
From lucky breaks to failures, Jordan shares all the lessons she’s learnt across her life and career so far…
Which single daily habit or practice could you not do without?
I always make sure I have a nice meal every day. Cooking is my way to unwind. It also allows me to switch off from the digital world.
What’s been your luckiest break?
The Google’s UX update allowed me to hone in on this area; utilising what I knew and leverage the skills I was passionate about. It’s also led me nicely to a new career path, not too far away from what I had been doing.
What’s your best failure?
Being let go from my first job – I felt like a failure, even if it was purely down to the loss of a client.
What is the best investment you’ve ever made, either financial or time?
Using AddPeople’s Personal Development allowance to learn UX.
Which podcast or book would you recommend others to read and why?
Growth Design Series.
What one piece of advice would you give your 21-year-old self?
Don’t give up. You’ll find your niche.
Tell us something about you that would surprise people.
I love ASMR – and I adore Lady Gaga.
If there was one thing you could change about your career, what would it be and why?
Finding UX sooner – or moving to CRO (my new area of focus) sooner.
What does success look like to you?
Continuous self development.
