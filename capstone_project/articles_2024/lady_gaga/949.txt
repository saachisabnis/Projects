It’s not uncommon for celebrities to use stage names in Hollywood, but some stars’ actual monikers may surprise you.
Take Ashton Kutcher, for example. While accepting the Ultimate Choice honor at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards, the That’s ’70s Show alum turned entrepreneur admitted that he was actually named Chris
“In Hollywood, there’s a lot of insider secrets to keeping your career going and I feel like a fraud,” he said at the time. “My name in fact is not even Ashton — Ashton is my middle name. My first name’s Chris and it always has been. It got changed when I was about 19 and became an actor.”
He added, “There are some really amazing things I learned when I was Chris, and I wanted to share those things with you guys because I think it’s helped me be here today.”

Funnily enough, Kutcher’s ex-wife, Demi Moore, and current wife, Mila Kunis, also go by different monikers in the public eye. Moore, born Demetria Gene Guynes, shortened her first name and adopted her first husband Freddy Moore’s surname. Kunis, for her part, abbreviated her first name, Milena, to Mila when she started booking roles as a young actress.

Real name: Ramón Antonio Gerardo EstévezThe West Wing alum told Closer Weekly in June 2022 that changing his stage name from his Spanish immigrant father’s given name is “one of my regrets,” revealing that he has “never changed” the moniker officially. “It's still Ramon Estévez on my birth certificate. It's on my marriage license, my passport, driver's license,” he explained. “Sometimes you get persuaded when you don't have enough insight or even enough courage to stand up for what you believe in, and you pay for it later. But, of course, I'm only speaking for myself."

Real name: Tyler Okonma
His stage name came from his MySpace, which he created at 13 years old in 2004, but as an adult, the rapper has started to embrace his real name. He realized that the African name Okonma (pronounced, as the performer says, like "a coma") is "pretty cool" and started using the credit on his album credits.
"My full name, Tyler Okonma, in all caps, just looks really cool," the performer said in a December 2021 interview with Fast Company. "So you might see more of that, I don't know. I'm getting older, and I think people get older, they start realizing s--t and liking things they didn't like. You just start changing. I think my version of that is looking at my name and saying, 'Oh, this is actually cool.'"

Real name: Thandiwe Newton
The Westworld actress dropped the “w” in her first name while attending Catholic school in England. She went by Thandie Newton for nearly 30 years, until she reclaimed her birth name in April 2021, telling British Vogue, “That’s my name. It’s always been my name. I’m taking back what’s mine.” The actress explained that while starring in Flirting in 1991, she was incorrectly credited as Thandie and it stuck.
