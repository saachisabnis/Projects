Joker: Folie á Deux is directed by Todd Phillips, who also directed 2019’s Joker. Before that, Phillips primarily directed comedy movies, including 2003’s Old School, 2004’s Starsky & Hutch, 2009’s The Hangover, 2010’s Due Date, 2011’s The Hangover Part II, 2013’s The Hangover Part III, and 2016’s War Dogs.
The first Joker movie was released in October 2019. It was a massive hit for Warner Bros. Pictures, bringing in approximately $1.079 billion at the global box office off an estimated $55 million budget. It was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, with Phoenix winning Best Actor and Hildur Guðnadóttir winning Best Original Score.
Joker was originally intended to be a stand-alone film; however, Phillips announced in June 2022 that a sequel was officially happening. Joker: Folie á Deux is set in a different continuity than James Gunn and Peter Safran’s forthcoming DC Universe, which officially kicks off this coming December with an animated Creature Commandos series.
The screenplay for Joker 2 was co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, both of whom also wrote the first film.
