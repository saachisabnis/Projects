Last week, we had a shocking elimination on Drag Race. The multi-talented Broadway baby (and presumed frontrunner) Plasma was sent home after her goth ball look failed to impress. The New York queen discussed her experience on the show and showed us the fashions we didn‚Äôt get to see as she chats with Michelle Visage on ‚ÄúWhatcha Packin‚Äô?‚Äù
Paying tribute to the song that sent her home, Plasma gives us her take on Lady Gaga‚Äôs ‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù with a fabulous new video. More of this please‚Ä¶because I am sure this isn‚Äôt the last we‚Äôll see of this talented queen.
DRAG QUEEN FABULOCITY
