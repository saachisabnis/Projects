A Nightmare on Elm Street is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Mike talks to Robert Englund who played Freddy Kruger and Heather Langenkamp who played Nancy in the film. They talk about the history of the movie through Mike’s number themed questions. Then Mike talks to director Juan Pablo Arias Munoz about his new movie  The Curse of the Necklace. They talk about being a Latino in the movie industry, movie to the US to pursue his dream and the beauty of horror. In the Movie Review, Mike gives his thoughts on Joker: Folie à Deux with Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. How it compares to the original, why the musical numbers didn’t work, the wasted Batman character and why this movie was a slap int the face.  In the Trailer Park, Mike talks about Red One starring the Rock and how he thought it was. Parody movie at first. It’s a Christmas-action-comedy about a villain who kidnaps Santa Claus from the North Pole.
