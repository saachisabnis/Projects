Everything changed for Lady Gaga when she fell in love with fiancé Michael Polansky. 
The "Poker Face" songstress recently sat down with People to discuss the evolution of their relationship, detailing the moment the stars aligned and she was ready to "fully just go into it" and create a record with her beau. 
"It's just the first time that we decided to fully just go into it and do it. It just felt right. We were both so excited. We were all warmed up and ready to go." Gaga spoke highly of her connection with Polansky, revealing that she was ready to be all in the moment she considered him her "best friend."  
"I just love my fiancé so much. He's my best friend. He's my partner, and I just feel like when you are with your best friend, everything changes." The "Bad Romance" hitmaker's mother was first to meet the businessman in 2019, and knew right away that he was the perfect match for her daughter. 
"I think I just met your husband," Gaga's mom candidly revealed after chatting with Polansky. The pair went on to date and decided to quarantine together in 2020; a time the icon greatly cherished as it gave her the rare opportunity to focus on her relationship.  
The star announced her engagement to Polansky during this year's Summer Olympic Games in Paris, introducing her partner as her "fiancé" to French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. 
In addition to wedding planning, the pair also co-produced Gaga's latest album, Harlequin, inspired by her role in the new Joker sequel, Joker: Folie À Deux, slated to hit theaters this fall.
