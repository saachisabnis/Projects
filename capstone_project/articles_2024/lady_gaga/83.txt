	Below, find some of the best quotes from the panel:

Álvaro Díaz on his creative process: “Sayonara has really been a great blessing. I fell in love with the sound, especially in Puerto Rico. Pursuing projects that have their own identity, sounding like Álvaro Díaz and not like anyone else, is crucial. At the end of the day, the artists who stand out are those who dare. Things are always changing. I always prefer to be alone, I like to enter the studio and flow with what we are feeling. Having the privilege to work with someone like Yandel or someone like Rauw, who started from scratch with us, makes it more challenging to compose by oneself. The trick should always be to continuously learn, never assume you know everything.”

Caleb Calloway on his first album Hayabusa: “It’s exciting. It’s been a process. I’ve always looked up to many people in the industry, and having my own label The New Wave Group, we did it all ourselves. I always had the vision. Be yourself. With the money we have, we need to support these artists. She [Young Miko] is now a superstar (who Calloway produces for since her foundations). Having an identity takes time. Keep pitching, keep searching for your identity; it will take you to another level.”

Chachito on his beginnings to becoming a hitmaker: “At the age of 13 or 14, when I was a soccer player, I realized that I could write songs and decided to learn to play the guitar. It became my passion; day and night, I couldn’t put the guitar down. I work with Oscar Maydon, he gives me ideas and I execute them. What I enjoy the most is starting from scratch with artists and watching them grow. In my work routine, I have a formula: at night, I clear my mind and start writing titles. Out of about 30, I choose two. For me, the important thing is the experiences; for example, the first time I saw a bottle of Dom Pérignon in a club with the words ‘Lady Gaga’ on it inspired me to write ‘Lady Gaga’ [by Peso Pluma].”

	










Armenta on his creative process: “Since I was 11 years old, I have been immersed in corridos, Mexican music influenced by figures like Juan Gabriel, Joan Sebastian, and Los Tucanes [de Tijuana]. Transitioning to a songwriter meant adapting to global styles. It’s important to decide the space you want to be in; the intention of the melody, whether it’s sad or happy, is crucial, although studying musical theory can be a bit boring. But you need to understand it; major tones make a melody constitute 70% of a song’s impact. Catchy hooks are essential. You have to accept that you won’t always be the best, but life gives you talent and, with dedication and hard work, you can [stand out].”

Albert Hype on connecting regional and urbano music: “I started making beats in 2015 after playing in a bunch of punk bands. A lot of my style came from playing in rock bands, and now I’m doing the Latin scene, trying to incorporate rock into it. I met Ivan [Cornejo] at a Billboard [event]; he was already on my radar. The Mexican regional genre is massive now, reminiscent of reggaetón in 2019 when there was a massive renaissance. That’s what’s happening with regional; helping push that genre forward. I feel we’re bridging the gaps that used to exist between regional and urbano.”
