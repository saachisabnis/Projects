After Lady Gaga used a Taylor Swift lyrical reference – “Not pregnant–just down bad cryin at the gym” –  to squash internet rumors about her being pregnant, Swift herself has come to Gaga’s defense. Swift commented on Gaga’s TikTok on Wednesday, chastising anyone who judges women’s appearances while defending their right to privacy regarding their bodies and their personal lives. “Can we all agree that it’s invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body,” Swift said in her comment. “Gaga doesn’t owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.” Swift has also been the subject of pregnancy rumors herself as of late, with overly curious fans closely examining photos from Taylor’s European leg of The Eras Tour and speculating about a possible baby bump being visible on the pop superstar.
