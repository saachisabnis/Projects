Gojira have announced they will perform at the 2024 Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony.
Le Parisien and Time Out have both reported that the French metal band will play this upcoming Friday (July 26), where they will apparently collaborate with opera singer Marina Viotti in their performance.
It is currently unclear whether frontman Joe Duplantier will be duetting with Viotti or not.
So far, other performers confirmed include Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, who will be performing a duet of Edith Piaf classic ‘La Vie En Rose’ together.

The performance will mark Dion’s first time taking to the stage in over four years, following her being diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome – a rare, chronic neurological disorder that causes muscle stiffness and intense spasms.
She last took to the stage in 2020 when she performed in New York, and she was expected to embark on a world tour last year, but was forced to axe all scheduled dates due to the condition.
French Afrobeats star Aya Nakamura is also rumoured to appear amidst a far-right row that has erupted over her inclusion.
Meanwhile, Gojira will be appearing at KoRn’s 30th anniversary stadium show which will take place at Los Angeles’ BMO Stadium on Saturday, October 5.
They will be performing alongside Evanescence, Scars On Broadway, Spiritbox, Vended and Daron Malakian – visit here to purchase tickets.
