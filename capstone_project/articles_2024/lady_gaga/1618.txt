The two stars have more than any other female artists.

Ariana Grande is at the top of the mountain for Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 debuts, but she isn’t there alone.

	In a new TikTok video shared by MTV UK Friday (Nov. 22), the 31-year-old pop star had a sweet reaction to finding out that she and Taylor Swift are tied for most songs to enter at the top of the U.S. chart among female artists, with seven each. “Really? I didn’t know that,” she said of the number with surprise while sitting next to Wicked costar Cynthia Erivo.

	“That can’t be true,” Grande added. 

	When the interviewer mentioned that the “Cruel Summer” singer is the only other female artist with seven Hot 100 No. 1 debuts, the R.E.M. Beauty founder and Pinocchio actress started tapping their nails with reverent applause. “Good company!” Grande said of Swift, smiling as Erivo nodded in agreement.

	The 14-time Grammy winner tied the Victorious alum’s record this spring, when “Fortnight” featuring Post Malone entered at the apex of the Hot 100. Swift has previously debuted in the top spot with “Is It Over Now?,” “Anti-Hero,” “All Too Well (10 Minute Version),” “Willow,” “Cardigan” and “Shake It Off.”

	Grande earned her seventh No. 1 debut in March, when Eternal Sunshine‘s “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” claimed the reigning placement in its first week on the chart. Her past No. 1 debuts include “Yes, And?,” “Positions,” “Rain on Me” with Lady Gaga, “Stuck With U” with Justin Bieber, “7 Rings” and “Thank U, Next.”

	The only other artist with more No. 1 debuts is Drake, with nine. In total, Grande has topped the Hot 100 nine times, while Swift has done so 12 times. 

	The MTV UK interview comes amid colossal career moments for both women. On Friday, Wicked starring Grande and Erivo premiered in theaters after three years in the making — and months of promotional build-up — while Swift is on the precipice of closing out her two-year Eras Tour in December.

	Interactions between the two artists have been few and far between over the years, but they’ve maintained an outward respect for one another. In 2014, they co-headlined the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show and snapped a photo together backstage — “Oh my God she couldn’t be cuter,” Swift wrote of Grande on Instagram at the time — and when the former included a drag performer channeling Ari in her “You Need to Calm Down” music video, the latter applauded the project on Instagram Stories in 2019.

	“Ty for having me in your video I was amazing @taylorwift,” Grande joked at the time. “Taylor, Congrats on YNTCD. I f–king love it and the message soooooo much.”
