Lady Gaga is once again shaking up the music world with a surprise announcement! The “Rain on Me” singer has revealed her secret project: a companion album for the upcoming film Joker: Folie à Deux, titled Harlequin. The album is set to drop on Friday, September 27, and fans couldn’t be more excited.
“Harlequin. September 27. A companion album to Joker: Folie à Deux,” Gaga shared with her fans on social media, alongside the album cover art and a full list of track titles. This unexpected release has already sent fans into a frenzy, eager to hear how Gaga has musically captured the dark, chaotic essence of the Joker’s world.
Speculation about the album started circulating after Gaga began dropping mysterious hints across the internet. The pop icon teased a cryptic project, which she referred to as “LG6.5,” by posting random lyrics and images of billboards popping up in major cities around the United States. These billboards featured phrases like, “I’m ready for my interview,” “Don’t tell me what to wear,” “No duct tape, no mission,” and “Moon dust gets everywhere.” Each one left fans scratching their heads but on high alert for more clues.
Some fans speculated that these posts hinted at new music, while others thought she might be promoting her role in the upcoming Joker sequel, where she stars as Harley Quinn.
Now, the cat’s out of the bag—Harlequin is indeed real, and it’s set to be the perfect sonic companion to the psychological thriller Joker: Folie à Deux. The album will serve as a bridge between Gaga’s previous album, Chromatica, and her much-anticipated seventh studio album. Her forthcoming album is expected to begin with a lead single in October, but this new project is giving fans something exciting to look forward to in the meantime.
Gaga has even added some playful touches to the album rollout. A few days before the big announcement, she teased fans with a shirt that read, “You’re listening to Harlequin radio,” further hinting at the upcoming release. With Gaga’s flair for the dramatic, it’s no surprise that she would keep fans guessing until the very last minute.
For now, Harlequin promises to be a thrilling musical journey. As we wait for the release of her next full-length album, this companion piece is sure to hold fans over with its connection to one of the most anticipated films of the year.
