Get ready for some discourse, folks: In case you’ve forgotten — and you probably have — in the stew that is the state of the world at the moment, we’re finally getting more Arthur Fleck this fall. That’s right: Just in time for the first R-rated Superhero extravaganza to blow up box office records (only Deadpool could unseat Jim Caviezel Jesus), we’ve got a brand new trailer for Todd Phillips’ Joker: Folie A Deux, which gives you a clearer look at Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix and the production design team, who Martin Scorsese will probably one day sue for trademark infringement. Warner Bros. dropped the new footage earlier on Tuesday, and it looks… swell? The first movie wasn’t terrible.
Peep it:
Here’s a synopsis and cast list, as well as some box-office braggadocio:
“From acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes ‘Joker: Folie À Deux,’ the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning ‘Joker,’ which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (‘A Star Is Born’). ‘Joker: Folie À Deux’ finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that’s always been inside him. The film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (‘The Banshees of Inisherin’) and Catherine Keener (‘Get Out,’ ‘Capote’), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from ‘Joker.’“
Joker: Folie A Deux will have its world premiere at Venice in September before it hits a theater near you on October 4. Let’s see if this one gets added to the TIFF lineup soon enough so we can get you a very silly spit-take reaction.
