Ty Dolla $ign accidentally sent half a million dollars in cryptocurrency to the wrong place, but thankfully, he’s already bounced back.
Taking to X on Monday (October 7), the Los Angeles native proudly announced he dropped $500k on blockchain platform SunDog. The next day, however, he had a grave realization.

“Yo, where my $SUNDOG at? I sent it to my TRX address and it ain’t showing???” he asked his followers.
The official SunDog account replied and swiftly let him know he’d screwed up.

“Ser… did you really just burn your bag? You sent it to the contract address,” the post read, tagging SunDog creator Justin Sun at the end for help.
“So it’s gone?? What am I supposed to do now?” Ty asked.

Thankfully, Justin soon jumped in and remedied the situation, sending Ty $500K TRX to “get back in the game.”
“You a real one for this,” Ty replied. “Putting that RIGHT BACK into SUNDOG.”

On the music side of things, Ty Dolla $ign has been busy promoting his Kanye West collab Vultures 2 around the world.
Last month, the duo delivered a sold-out performance at Haikou’s Wuyuanhe Stadium – selling over 42,000 tickets in a matter of minutes to make themselves one of the few Western artists to perform in the notoriously strict country that previously banned the likes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber from touring there.

The show, billed as a Vultures listening experience, featured a number of noteworthy moments, including the premiere of a remake of Vanessa Carlton’s 2002 pop hit “A Thousand Miles.”
In a snippet of the song captured during the show, Ty can be heard singing the song over a beat that closely resembles the original.

While Ye’s vocals aren’t heard in the video, the track also features feral noises that were lifted from Skinbone’s viral parody remix of “A Thousand Miles” from 2018.
The unexpected track left many listeners bemused, with one commenting on X: “What the fuck even is the vultures era anymore.”

Another said: “Vultures 3 is gonna be the biggest troll ever,” while somebody else went so far as to declare: “Kanye is losing his creativity in real time lmao.”
Even streaming star Adin Ross was left raising his eyebrows at the song while watching the concert on his Kick channel.

Elsewhere during the show, Kanye West debuted another brand new song called “Preacher Man,” which received a more positive response from fans online.
He revealed that the track is from his “next project,” although it’s unclear if he was referring to Vultures 3 or an upcoming solo album.
