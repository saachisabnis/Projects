After Lady Gaga was spotted at her sister's wedding on June 1, rumors about her being pregnant started swirling, NBC News reports. On June 4, the 38-year-old pop star took to TikTok to dispel those rumors. An onscreen caption read, "not pregnant - just down bad crying at the gym," referencing a Taylor Swift lyric from the song "Down Bad."
Swift commented on the TikTok, saying, "Can we all agree that itâ€™s invasive & irresponsible to comment on a womanâ€™s body? Gaga doesnâ€™t owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman."
Other users praised Swift and celebrated the megastars' friendship. Meanwhile, on Instagram, Gaga's story read, "Not pregnant. REGISTER TO VOTE or check if you've already registered."
