Lady Gaga seemingly revealed her engagement to Michael Polansky while attending the 2024 Paris Olympics.
The “Bad Romance” singer, 38, introduced Polansky as “my fiancé” when meeting French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. Attal shared a video of the meeting on TikTok.
“Thank you Lady Gaga for your stunning performance at the opening ceremony,” Attal captioned the post, apparently unaware that he was breaking major international celebrity news. “It was breathtaking.”
Neither Gaga, whose legal name is Stefani Germanotta, nor Polansky have publicly confirmed the news. The duo previously sparked engagement rumors in April, when Gaga was spotted with a diamond ring on her left ring finger.
Polansky, a tech entrepreneur, and Gaga were first spotted together kissing at a New Year’s Eve Party as 2020 began. They were also seen at the Super Bowl just over a month later in Miami.
However, the two have largely kept their relationship away from the public eye. Gaga made a rare reference to Polansky in a 2021 Hollywood Reporter interview in which she said, “My dogs and the man that I love are my whole life.”
In October 2023, after Gaga made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” she and Polansky were spotted together at the cast afterparty.
Gaga has not been married previously, but she has been engaged twice. In February 2015, she said yes to “Chicago Fire” star Taylor Kinney, but they broke things off the next year. A few years later, she got engaged to talent agent Christian Carino, but they separated in February 2019.
