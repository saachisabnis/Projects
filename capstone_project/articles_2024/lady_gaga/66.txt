Hi, it's Stacey & Mike and for the month of September our Helping Hands are focusing on Artist Mentorship Program, or AMP.Â 
The Artist Mentorship Program (AMP) is dedicated to empowering young people experiencing homelessness, utilizing art and music as powerful tools for healing, growth, and empowerment.
AMP believes that every young person deserves access to opportunities for self-expression, personal growth, and positive social connections. Their programs are designed to provide a safe and nurturing environment where youth can explore their creativity, develop new skills, and build supportive relationships with caring mentors. They provide music lessons, art workshops, job readiness training, meals and social services.
Lady Gaga is a believer! AMP was chosen as one recipient of her Kindness in Community Fund.
There are many ways you can help including volunteering, making a donation, or buying tickets to AMP's 30th Anniversary Fundraiser Concert, Saturday, October 5 at Mission Theater. It's an all ages show that starts at 8pm, doors at 7pm. This milestone event promises an unforgettable evening of live performances by Quasi, Camp Crush, and The Mistons, with special guests adding to the excitement. It's a perfect opportunity to celebrate three decades of empowering Portland's youth through music and art. Don't miss out on this special occasion to honor AMP's impact and support its future. Save the date and be part of a night filled with incredible music, community, and inspiration!
