Um, excuse?!
Once upon a time over the weekend, Lady Gaga went ahead and introduced her partner, Michael Polansky, to the Prime Minister of France as her fiancé, and he...went ahead and put the video on TikTok.
Of course, those of us who have been monitoring Lady Gaga’s left hand (it’s normal/fine) know that she was seen wearing what looked to be an engagement ring back in April. Buuut it turns out she and Michael actually made things official even earlier than that—like, sometime before her 38th birthday in March. So according to our calculations, the musician has been secretly engaged for almost five (!!!) months without any of us realizing. 
”The couple shared the happy news with family and close friends right away but wanted to keep the engagement private otherwise,” a source recently dished to People before going on to confirm that Gaga and Michael are currently in the midst of planning what we can only assume will be the most iconic/camp wedding of all time. 
“Everyone’s excited about them getting married,” the insider explained, adding that Gaga is “the happiest with Michael,” the couple is “great together,” and that Michael is “excited and supportive of her career.”
As for the A-lister’s fiancé, he’s pretty much the opposite of Gaga when it comes to the spotlight but fully supports her being the center of it. According to the person close to the sitch, “He can’t stand being in the spotlight but lets her shine. He has his own business priorities that she’s supportive of.”
