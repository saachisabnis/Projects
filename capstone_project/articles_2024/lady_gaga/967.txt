The 2024 Paris Olympics might have just ended, but that means it's time for you to take a moment ASAP to gather the group chat for your next trip to the 2028 LA Olympics. Seriously, if you don’t make the time to plan now, you’ll blink and all the feats of athleticism and amazing outfits will have passed you by—even if it's 4 years away.
So, alert the Virgos in your life, because the schedules for the next few years have already been released. Meaning: we know when the next Olympics are happening from 2028 alllll the way to 2034. We’ve compiled a list of all the host locations we can look forward to seeing at the Winter and Summer Olympic Games of the future. You’re welcome!    
Dates: February 6 to February 22
Milan might be a fabulous Italian city for shopping, but it’s about to become an amazing location for watching the Olympic Games! Milan will host the Winter Olympics for the first time ever while sharing the hosting duties with ski town Cortina d’Ampezzo, which had the privilege of doing so back in 1956. Expect sustainability to be at the top of the agenda again, as 13 of the 14 venues will be temporary or existing structures. 
Also expect for athletes and commentators to be dressed to the nines when they’re not working—Cortina d’Ampezzo is well known for its ski fashion, and there are tons of archival images to prove it. Dare we say it's giving Lady Gaga and Adam Driver in House of Gucci?
Dates: July 21 to August 6
Americans, our time is now (well, JK, it’s actually in a couple of years)—the Summer Olympics are coming back to the United States for the first time in 32 years! The USA hosted the Olympic Games back in 1932 and 1984, but things are going to be a biiit different this time. Per LA28.org, no new structures will be built for the Games and existing parks and venues in the greater Los Angeles area will be used for the sporting events. As for the Olympic Athletes Village? Yep, that’ll be happening at the University of California, so…expect that to get messy AF.
Dates: February 8 to February 24
So technically, details about the 2030 Winter Olympics haven't been decided just yet. The final decision about the host city will be made at the 142nd IOC Session in Paris on July 24 2024, two days before the 2024 Summer Olympics. As of right now, the French Alps are the main contender for 2030, per the International Olympic Committee Executive Board. The board has also reportedly proposed Salt Lake City, Utah as the host of the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2034.
Dates: July 23 to August 8
According to the Olympics website, Australia has a very special relationship with the Games—it’s one of just two countries that have sent athletes to compete at every modern Olympics (okay, impressive!). The 2032 Summer Olympics will also mark Australia’s third time hosting. Sydney had the honor of hosting in 2000 while Melbourne hosted the Games in 1956.
Dates: February 10 to 26
The Games are making their way back to Utah for the first time in 22 years (!!!). The decision was announced during the 142nd IOC Session Paris ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics on July 24, 2024.
“Salt Lake City and Utah are long-time friends of the Olympic Movement, and we are confident that they will organize exceptional Olympic and Paralympic Games, just as they did years ago,” IOC President Thomas Bach said. “The legacy of 2002 is tangibly and passionately alive in Utah. The legacy of 2034 starts today.”
