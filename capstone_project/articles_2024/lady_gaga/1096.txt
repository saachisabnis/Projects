Complete with a full fringe, no less!
Back in the day (circa the early 2010s), there was nothing Lady Gaga could surprise us with. Meat dress? Natch. Fire tits (read: bra)? Obvs. A stage soaked in fake blood at the MTV VMAs? Duh! However, a decade or so later and 2024 has seen the star provide somewhat tamer looks – with today's dramatic hair transformation being an exception. Gaga's only gone and got a red bob haircut!
OK, OK, it's not quite as head-turning as meeting Queen Elizabeth while wearing a red latex 'fit and bejewelled eye makeup but in comparison to her recent beauty – I'm talking bleached brows and black glass hair – Gaga's short cut is one to note.
Announced in the past hour [September 5, 2024], Lady Gaga is the latest Vogue cover star, donning the October 2024 issue front and centre. For such a gig, the team went above and beyond, transforming the singer-turned-actor-turned-beauty mogul with an unrecognisable hair look.
As shown in the above Instagram post, the Haus Labs founder now rocks a just-above-chin-length wet-look bob, complete with a full fringe, too. Not to mention its blood-red tone and the striking yellow eye paint and smudged black liner.
Props go out to the geniuses behind the transformation, hairstylist, Frederic Aspiras and makeup artist, Sarah Tanno. I've said it before and I'll say it again: glam squads are Hollywood's unsung heroes. 
Snaps for Frederic, Sarah and of course, our girl Gaga!
