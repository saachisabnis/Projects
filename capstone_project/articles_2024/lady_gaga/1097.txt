Earlier this week, Lady Gaga announced the official release of the Chromatica Ball concert film, and has now shared its trailer.
“I’m so excited that we can finally share The Chromatica Ball film with the world. This film chronicles a time of immense creativity…the fashion, the dance, the music," Lady Gaga shared. "Revisiting the tour leaves me speechless the way we had each other—you all showed up for music and art in a big way, and with a level of excitement and freedom that I will never forget. Stadium after stadium. Sold out crowds. The deafening singalongs.
The concert film was recorded at Los Angeles’ Dodger Stadium in September 2022 during the tour for her 2020 album Chromatica.
