AC/DC’s Brian Johnson makes a surprise appearance in a special holiday edition of Apple TV+ and Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke.
A Carpool Karaoke Christmas, with Zane Lowe behind the wheel instead of James Corden, focuses on three pop stars — Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa and Chappell Roan. Johnson turns up during Gaga’s segment.
“You know what, I got you something for Christmas,” Lowe says, before stopping and picking up Johnson, which comes as a complete surprise to Gaga. 
The rocker then takes over behind the wheel, with Lowe asking, “You guys ready to rock?” Johnson responds to Gaga, “You were born ready.”
That leads to them all singing AC/DC’s classic “Highway to Hell.” At one point Johnson takes his hands off the wheel, shocking Gaga, who jokes, “We’re all gonna die and go to hell.”
Gaga then reveals a special connection she has to AC/DC, sharing that she was an extra in their “Stiff Upper Lip” video when she was 17. 
“I was head banging and they were like, ‘Um, don’t head bang, we want it to be modern,’” Gaga says, “and I was like, ‘No, there’s only one move that I can do.’”
Johnson ends his ride by wishing Gaga a Merry Christmas and joking, “I should have told you I don’t have a license.”
