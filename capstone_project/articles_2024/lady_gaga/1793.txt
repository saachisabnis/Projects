Literally everyone is disappointed in the movie, so it’s not making BP hence Gaga is not happening, but I feel like she’ll get GG, CC and SAG nods. 
i think she’s only getting a GG nod…maybe critics ‘cause they have 6 slots but even there i think it’s a reach
Right now, the only one who probably gets into this category without being in a Best Picture contender is Deadwyler.
The rest are in Best Picture contenders –  Saldaña, Ronan, Jones, Gomez and Rossellini
 Actually reception on Twitter is very positive 
 Thank you. Most that saw it yesterday got to love it and they’re not just Gaga fans

 They don’t happen for roles like that, no. She needs that BP nod. Rosselinni’s cameo is likelier to happen if Joker 2 doesn’t fare well with AMPAS. 
 I respect your opinion. At least you don’t sound like a biased hater. But if Gaga gets those nominations, she’ll likely get the Oscar as well. I know the Gucci snub was real, but maybe it can’t repeat. There’s a kind of narrative here already. And despite the criticisms, Joker 2 feels like it can nab a BP nom. It has good enough reviews. Only that it isn’t from Adam McKay

What don’t you understand? The movie doesn’t have good reviews, there are plenty of stronger contenders from more reputable films, and we have 90+ years of Oscar statistics to base our predictions on. It’s not about hatred. It’s about facts.
Lone acting nominees in the Supporting Actress category are rare. When they do occur, it’s usually for actresses with significant respect (like Close or Bassett) or for critically acclaimed performances in well-regarded films, such as Weaver in Animal Kingdom. Joker 2 isn’t as acclaimed, and Gaga doesn’t carry the same level of respect. She also has an Oscar, which means she’s not really due for another acting nomination or a win. This suggests she lacks a compelling narrative to support her chances. Lack of narrative + lack of critics support + lack of respect + stronger contenders/movies around = 0% at the Oscars.
Objectively, you have two actresses from Emilia Pérez who are more likely to be nominated. Then there’s Deadwyler, Felicity Jones in The Brutalist, Ellis-Taylor, then Collette in an Eastwood film. Plus, a popular veteran like Rossellini. What more proof do you need?
You can’t seriously believe that the daily mentions on those online platforms reflect actual industry buzz. It’s all about clicks and selling a story, not genuine buzz from within the industry.

 Funny of you to think only BP nominees make it here. The Academy won’t nominate same movies in different categories. Gaga won’t even be a lone nominee. Even if it happens to miss BP, Joker will still get some tech noms. Gaga could miss, but BP nominee isn’t everything. If there’s passion for the performance, she can happen. Let’s wait and see how the precursors go. They can’t all nominate same six or five names. I don’t understand the sudden agenda to nominate someone who’s said to have a thankless cameo just because her film is up for BP.
On not having respect, they love Gaga well enough to let her present their biggest award. She’s been invited to perform even before she got her first song nomination. She’s loved and respected enough. Gucci snub doesn’t mean she’s not loved or respected. Many actors have had their snub days

Netflix won’t have three slots here. One of them will likely miss.

I don’t get the Danielle Deadwyler predictions. This movie is not making any king of noise… I think Felicity Jones is stronger than her. Danielle would need to deliver a spectacular and career-defining performance imo. 
1. Zoe Saldana (Netflix)
2. Saoirse Ronan (Apple)
3. Isabella Rossellini (Universal)
4. Selena Gomez (Netflix)
5. Felicity Jones (Universal)
This is my prediction. Imo, Gaga would sneak in if Warner Bros focus the whole Joker campaign on her and the movie is successful in box office. She’s carrying the promotion. But I’m not predicting her now.
Jones and Gomez are ahead of Rossellini as of now
EGOT & Triple Crown of Acting winner, VIOLA DAVIS
2-time Oscar winner, EMMA STONE
Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK
Oscar & Emmy nominee, SEBASTIAN STAN
I think it’s entirely possible Gaga still gets in. Reception for her has been particularly great. However, I wouldn’t be surprised if she missed because of the reception of the film. My guess is she gets an original song nod and that’s it for this film. I’m excited to watch the film tho!
Jones and Gomez are ahead of Rossellini as of now
I’m iffy on Selena Gomez. She was nominated for Emmy so it looks like they’re taking her seriously, but two spots for the same movie is always a brave prediction imo. And she’s in a foreign language movie. I hope she gets in btw. But the narrative around Rossellini make me feel she’s a little stronger. I don’t think a small screen time is a problem. Lee Curtis won for a cameo.
Netflix won’t have three slots here. One of them will likely miss.
Netflix managed to get 3 supporting actors in at the 92nd Oscars. It’s not impossible. 
With how open this race is, Netflix getting 3 slots is not the craziest thing that could happen.
