 The movie is not even in the top 10 of Netflix US pls 
i was talking about ww not us
Universal is trying to sabotage Zoe for possible Ariana nom.
At the end Emilia has critics and acting legends campaigning for them and wicked? Clayton Davis’ bought ass
Y’all are reading way too much into one article lol. It literally mentions how placement is also murky for Ariana (and Saoirse), why would their studios want them in the mix if it’s “paid” to sabotage Zoe? Clayton is just ass.
I think it’s a reach to say it’s Ariana’s team paying for this.
However, it is a fact that he wrote a whole article about why Zoe (woman of color) is, according to him, committing “category fraud”, yet, he also wrote an article advocating for Ariana (a white woman) to be nominated in the same category despite having the same screen time as Cynthia. And has made no comments about Kieran Culkin (a white man), who also shares the same screen time as his co-star, being the frontrunner in the supporting actor category.
If Zoe isn’t presumed to be the lead of the film, why is her name listed first during the end credits.
😂😂😂😂😂😂

This is a reach. Y’all are way too old to act like this.
Why would you BLAME Universal/Ariana? Lmao

the end credits? that’s your argument?
Ariana got them pressed since their faves will lose against her
Those kinds of article get published every year and everyone knows they are paid for most of the time. It’s not something brand new that is happening just to Saldana. There will be many more this year aiming for other artists like any award season that ever existed. But I do believe that nominations for Saldana and Grande (both leads) at the Oscars will eventually benefit a third person that’s actually supporting. If just Saldana gets a nomination, then I don’t think the backlash will get in the way of a win for her. She won’t be the first lead actress to win a supporting award and won’t be the last.
Selena was interviewed by Paul Rudd for perfect magazine

FYC: Emilia Pérez and I'm still here in all categories.
 I’ve said this before but for me Olivia is the clear Lead. 
Well, she clearly isn’t. Maybe you have a different concept of what a lead character is.
LA times predictions on “Best Supporting Actress” on the Oscars:
1. Danielle Deadwyler — “The Piano Lesson”
2. Zoe Saldaña — “Emilia Pérez”
3. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor — “Nickel Boys”
4. Selena Gomez — “Emilia Pérez”
5. Carrie Coon — “His Three Daughters”

 the end credits? that’s your argument? 
one of the reasons. Feels almost as if it is a Freudian slip.
Screentime is important, but it’s not the only defining factor about category placement. If this argument is used against Zoe, it’ll be kinda sus, since many similar cases were nominated in Supporting.
Just talking about recent nominations:
Rooney Mara for Carol
Alicia Vikander for The Danish Girl(winner)
Brad Pitt for OUATIH(winner)
Mahersalla Ali for Green Book(winner)
They were all co-leads with someone else and they were all nominated and most of them WON the supporting category.
