Give Meg Ryan the Oscar vehicle she deserves!
I think it’s just the Emmy voters don’t like her that much. They gave her the win for BLL cause she was undeniable and then just snubbed her completely after that point, even for season 2 of BLL. Meanwhile Oscar voters don’t have any trouble nominating her.
I  also think it is probably accepted that her name being attached is getting a lot of those things made. As an actress her stuff travels better than a lot of her peers too so even if it’s not a big American hit it’s likely doing solid numbers elsewhere.

Stream MAYHEM, give Sarah Snook her Tony, Colin Farrell his Emmy and make Severance, The Studio + The Pitt sweep all awards!
The 3x Emmy Winner for Best Drama Series, Succession!
Nicole Kidman fatigue is real after being nominated for Being the Ricardos at the Oscars over the likes of Jennifer Hudson (RESPECT) and Lady Gaga (HOUSE of GUCCI) and has resulted in her recent snubs for almost everything that she does. 
I don’t think is necessarily fatigue but Kidman hasn’t done many strong awards players since her Emmy win. BLL S2 and The Undoing were the only shows she did that were actual contenders and in the end both underperformed.
BLL had a very divisive S2 finale and The Undoing went against the most competitive Limited Series race ever and the reception wasn’t that great either. I hope she gets a strong vehicle in the future.
EGOT & Triple Crown of Acting winner, VIOLA DAVIS

Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK

The BLL season 2 finale walked so the HOTD season 2 finale could run.
The reception was so similar lmao.

Can’t believe we are here.  But reading between the lines, calling it now Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein are going to lead this and Jason Sudiekis might cameo and be more behind the scenes (because you don’t lead headlines without resigning Jason/Ted first without a reason).

The more important question is, Will Bill Lawrence return to writing duties? Because his exit was what made the show go downhill but he has like a thousand different shows to work on so idk.

That does make sense because Hannah said she’d refuse to do it without Jason and that would be a compromise. Honestly I wouldn’t mind that as such because the show has been at its strongest whenever Rebecca was the female lead and even though I have grievances with Roy Kent as a character and find Goldstein overrated in the part I can see the character working better in the role of the male lead. I do hope though that they’re able to do right by Juno after that awful storyline she had to deal with last season because it would otherwise such a waste for the only person in the cast who has managed to get an award nomination for a leading part in the interim. Interesting how the article cites that Dunster hasn’t had an option picked up because he might have a clash. I wonder if he’ll recur as opposed to exit the show altogether.

My guess is they need for marketing reasons to work out a way to keep the name. Maybe the spinoff sits under Ted Lasso Enterprises or something. At the end of the day Apple’s service is <1% of viewership, they can’t just go changing it to AFC Richmond or whatever.
Sudeikis was so done with the show that if he’s back, Apple payed him a billion dollars. I hope he’s back because Roy Kent as the lead would be awful.

that said though I’m looking at Jason’s IMDB and he’s really got nothing of note coming up.
I think both Jason and Hannah had (for various reasons relating to their kids) issues with travelling to the UK and US respectively. Hannah has done so a lot more recently so I think things might have changed. Maybe he’s open to it if they can shoot elements over there.
Also of note: late in the game with Ted there was talk about it getting a linear run at some point. Keep in mind this is WB (who are supposed to be skint) and the state of linear and cable. I can totally see them selling off the S1-3 rights to someone (NBC)  and then doing the rest as a co-pro with a linear partner.

I do think selling off the linear rights to streaming exclusives is going to become a lot more common now. The fact that CBS and ABC successfully did it during the strike aside I’ve noticed over here that it’s something that has become a lot more common with Disney selling a lot of their streaming exclusives to the BBC and Channel 4. Obviously the market is quite different here given how the linear broadcasters have stayed alive due to being deeply embedded into the streaming aspect of UK television but amidst a decrease in commissioning and cuts in production budgets it has worked a treat for both the traditional broadcasters and the new streamers with shows like Abbott Elementary, Dopesick and The Dropout hitting numbers they were failing to do under the Disney paywall and keeping momentum going for those broadcasters whilst also helping Disney gain more exposure in a crowded TV environment. Given how much the traditional broadcasters in the US have been taking from their counterparts over here recently (especially with the unprecedented increase in co-productions) and how they’re all more or less consolidating under their studio umbrellas (Fox and ABC shows on Hulu, CBS on Paramount+ and NBC on Peacock) I think this synergy they’ve been going for will become more commonplace. We’re already seeing that even on the cable side with WBD moving a lot of the Max shows onto HBO. Ultimately whilst most consumers of television on the planet have Netflix they are also feeling the squeeze of rising subscription costs. People in the industry may be tuning into these shows but there’s a reason why so few of them actually register when you talk to a random person on the street.
I will say though that I think it’s only really Disney/Hulu who have understood that to reach the same masses of people who will have tuned into their broadcast and cable entities 10 to 15 years ago. Peacock has obviously had a mixed bag of results but with the sports and the flow of Universal and Focus movies they’re getting access to at such short windows I think you can see they’re starting to cultivate a strategy there but Paramount isn’t even getting access to some of its films until 6 months after their theatrical windows. Given how they’re now selling some of their streaming exclusives off to other streamers I do wonder how long they have left before they shutter. It certainly wouldn’t shock me if by the end of this television cycle they end up moving Frasier back to broadcast (especially given they won’t have any more competition there from The Conners and Grammer seems hellbent on reaching 100 episodes lol) or that new Yellowstone spin-off with Pfeiffer ends up airing on Showtime (who are in a dire situation).
