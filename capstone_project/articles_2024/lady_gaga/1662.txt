Go shawty, it's ya birthday! 
When it comes to celebrating birthdays on social media, a great caption is not just a want but a n-e-e-d. Whether you're posting birthday wishes for your best friend, showing your beau some love on the 'gram, or even reminding everyone that it's the best day of the year (YOUR birthday, duh!), I'm sure you want a caption that's a step above the typical "HBD." Crafting the perfect Insta caption lets you show off your personality and makes precious memories even more special for you or whoever you're celebrating.
From clever one-liners and heartwarming reflections to simple emojis and bday-inspired lyrics, consider this a stress-free zone because we've got options on top of options. Below, you'll find 110 birthday Instagram captions for everyone that'll go perfectly with those festive snapshots. We've also got some captions for your own birthday IG because obviously, a) self-love is important and b) you've gotta share all the good pics from your b-day celebration (or just pics of yourself looking hot—it's your birthday, and you can post thirst traps if you want!) 
Once you've nailed the perfect birthday caption, you've gotta grab the person of honor a present! Luckily, we've got you covered there with plenty of gift ideas for your S.O., your mom, your BFF, and of course, yourself. You can thank us later!
