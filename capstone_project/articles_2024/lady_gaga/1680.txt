LOS ANGELES (TND)  â€” An arrest has been made after the theft of a French bulldog left the dog's owner clinging to the hood of the suspect's car as it sped away.
The Los Angeles Police Department said Saturday that a suspect, 21-year-old Sadie Slater, was arrested and booked for robbery with a bail of $70,000.
However, the police have not acknowledged if the dog has been found.
LAPD's gang and narcotics division said on X that US Marshals worked"through the night to locate and arrest the suspect wanted for this crime."
Ali Zacharias was seen in an online video holding on to the hood of what appears to be a white sedan as the suspect"kept going for several blocks before swerving, sending the dog owner to the ground," according to KABC.
Zacharias said in an online post that her dog, named Onyx, was "stolen out of my hands" in Los Angeles on Jan. 18.
LAPD said in a release on Jan. 29 that the victim was eating outside of a Whole Foods on South Grand Avenue when a female suspect picked up the victim's dog and fled.
"The victim attempted to stop the suspects by jumping on the hood of the vehicle as it traveled southbound from the location. The victim later fell from the vehicle and the suspects got away with her dog," according to police.
Officials added Zacharias was treated on the scene for minor abrasions.
"I thought I was going to die. I just was like 'this is it"," Zacharias told KABC.
There has been an uptick in French bulldog thefts in recent years with the most well-known case involving the shooting of Lady Gaga's dog walker and the stealing of her dogs in 2021.
In 2023, The American Kennel Club announced that French bulldogs have become the United States' most prevalent dog breed, ending Labrador retrievers' record-breaking 31 years at the top.
