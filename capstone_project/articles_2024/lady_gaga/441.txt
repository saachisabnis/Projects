Do you know which legendary pop artist also happens to be one of the shortest musicians around?
TheShot compiled a list of the shortest rockers, pop stars, country icons, hiphop legends and more to prove that "big things come in small packages." As the site notes, the average height for a woman in the U.S. is about 5'4" while the average height for men is 5'9," and many of the artists featured on the list don't full measure up to some of their counterparts. 
According to the list, Lady Gaga is the shortest pop star in recent memory, standing at a small but mighty 5'1" with a powerful voice that belies her small stature. Mother Monster packs a talented punch, however, and the site notes that "it's no wonder she picked such towering platforms for so long" to give her iconic fashions an elevated style â€” literally. 
Gaga stands at a similar height to pop punk princess Avril Lavigne and just a bit shorter than other superstars like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande. One beloved musician she does tower over (by about an inch!) is country legend Dolly Parton.
