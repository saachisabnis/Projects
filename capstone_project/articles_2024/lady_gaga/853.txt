2022 brought so many product recommendations my bank account wishes I hadn’t seen. My entire TikTok FYP is packed with makeup routines and the next hottest product. Everyone tells me I must have this product, so I tell my bank I must have that product.

	I want to feel as confident as a supermodel even if I don’t have their throngs of makeup artists and hair stylists. If they’re plugging a product, I’m probably gonna try it. But, in the age of the everyday influencer, it’s getting harder to tell what’s a paid advertisement and what’s not.


	That’s right – some videos don’t reveal if it’s a paid promotion or if it’s really an ad. Brands are sending free products to TikTok’s finest in exchange for rave reviews – even if the product sucks.


	Take Bobbi Brown’s clean beauty line, Jones Road, for example. It was hyped up to be the “no-makeup makeup” holy grail until products started rolling out. The foundation ended up leaking oil and separating from the foundation which is a pretty bad sign even if it can be mixed. Several users reported that it separated even while on their faces. It was an overall disaster.


	Since the year’s almost over, I’m rounding up all of the viral products I purchased and giving you the low down. The good, the bad, and the downright ugly. We are leaving no stone unturned.

Here are 10 things to keep this 2023, and 10 to leave in 2022:
