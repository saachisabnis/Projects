Lady Gaga has recently addressed the circulating rumors about her pregnancy.
Speculation arose after photos from her sister Natali Germanotta’s wedding weekend surfaced, with some images showing the singer appearing to have a baby bump, as reported by The US Sun. Gaga attended the Maine wedding with her longtime partner, Michael Polansky.
Adding to the buzz, Gaga was seen wearing a sizable diamond ring, sparking further speculation that she might be engaged to Polansky. The singer was first spotted with the diamond ring in April during an outing in West Hollywood, California.
However, Gaga has set the record straight in a new video shared on her TikTok channel.
In the video, Gaga firmly debunks the pregnancy rumors with a caption that reads, “not pregnant – just down bad cryin at the gym.” The caption appears to reference the song “Down Bad” from Taylor Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
In the clip, Gaga, dressed in a black T-shirt, smiles at the camera, putting an end to the recent speculations.
