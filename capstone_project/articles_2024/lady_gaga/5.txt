Perhaps you recall Natalie Portman’s Oscar-winning performance as Nina Sayers in Black Swan, a film all over last year’s balletcore moodboards. Last night, Addison Rae offered her own take on the white swan at the 2024 MTV VMAs – albeit with a Vegas showgirl spin.
Rae opted for a white satin bra and panty set lined with a scalloped trim from Miss Claire Sullivan. But thanks to some tulle and feathers, Rae took the look from bedroom to  stage. She added a voluminous tulle bustle that fanned out behind her like a swan, and feathers that emerged from her bra and bustle.
Rae kept the accessories simple, adding only a pair of white peep-toe satin pumps, a white hair barrette, and a belly-button piercing to match. And where better to wear an outré look than at the VMAs, where Lil’ Kim once wore a single nipple pasty and Lady Gaga hit the carpet in a meat dress? While Addison Rae has a bona fide pop-star wardrobe, from her Jean Paul Gaultier bullet bra to the Vivienne Westwood platforms she once wore to grab coffee in Los Angeles, this may very well be her boldest outfit yet.
