Kris Kristofferson has been in the country music scene my entire life. He was already a force to be reckoned with when I was born, and as just a child, I was listening to records with Kris Kristofferson songs on them.
Kris passed away peacefully at his home in Maui, Hawaii on Saturday, September 28th, 2024 at the age of 88.
Many people don't understand his mark on the music and movie industries. Kris wrote amazing songs, including 'Me and Bobby McGee,' and 'Help Me Make It Through The Night,' which I sang for many years as a touring artist.
Younger people may have seen Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in "A Star Is Born," but Kris Kristofferson was the original star opposite the amazing Barbara Streisand.
Now I look back at the gentlemen of music we called 'The Highwaymen'. Willie Nelson is the only one left. Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson recorded three major albums between 1985, my senior year in high school, and 1995, and had a number-one hit with 'Highwayman' in 1985.
Although I haven't seen Kris perform much in his later years, I did see him make some appearances on awards shows, and every time I see him, It's always thrilling. He has such a calm, cool demure, and a great smile like as if to say 'You'll be okay. Just keep pushin' on."One of my favorite roles from Kris Kristofferson was that of Martin 'Rubber Duck' Penwald in 1978'a Convoy. It was this movie along with a couple of others that caused my parents and their friends to get CB radios in their vehicles. We had a lot of fun listening to truckers back then. It also made us understand the heroes our truck drivers truly are.
Thank you, Kris, for sharing your great musical talent with us and helping create a great foundation for future actors and musicians to grow upon.
