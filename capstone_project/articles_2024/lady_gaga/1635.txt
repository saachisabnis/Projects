Apple TV+’s Carpool Karaoke is back and singing some tunes that are merry and bright. The streamer dropped a surprise holiday edition of James Corden’s Emmy-winning series with three of this year’s biggest superstars: Chappell Roan, Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga. But the biggest gift of all? The fact that the former late-night host passed the wheel to Apple Music personality Zane Lowe. Corden expressed his excitement for Lowe’s iteration of the show and offered some words of advice as well: “It’s so important to keep his eyes open while he sings.” 
Meanwhile, the ladies of Girls5eva are hoping for a similar phone call. Although Netflix has gone radio silent, Busy Philipps used her podcast Doing Her Best to announce that Girls5eva is “dead,” citing “not enough people watch, watched it or watched it the way that counts.” In the same breath, Philipps stressed that there’s been no official cancellation so the girls aren’t “dead-dead,” meaning that the show could potentially see life on yet another streamer after they moved from Peacock to Netflix between the second and third seasons. The actress joked that they should “do Radio City” or even a Broadway stage show. 
They wasted no time over on Twitter getting the week started with some hilarious stuff. Today’s funniest tweets include those about medieval New Jersey, people who don’t belong at karaoke and an emoji-free address book.
