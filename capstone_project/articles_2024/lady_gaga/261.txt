“Texas Hold ‘Em”, the new country hit from Beyoncé, has now marked its second week at No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the UK. 
The track debuted at the top spot last week and has held on to its position, outselling the likes of “Lose Control” by Teddy Swims at No. 2 and Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” at No. 3. 
This is Beyoncé’s sixth UK chart-topping single to date as a solo artist, following on from her very first with “Crazy in Love” back in the summer of 2003 and her most recent, which was “If I Were A Boy” in 2008. She also reached the No. 1 spot in 2010 for her collaboration with Lady Gaga on “Telephone”.
Beyoncé’s highly anticipated new album RENAISSANCE Act II will serve as the follow-up offering to her 2022 record RENAISSANCE and it is due to be released on March 29.
