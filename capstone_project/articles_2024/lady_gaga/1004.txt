Spine tattoos have surged in popularity in recent years. Celebrities like Halle Berry, Lady Gaga, and Billie Eilish have all given this tattoo placement their seal of approval. Whether you prefer intricate patterns that trace down the vertebrae's natural contours or minimalist designs that make an understated statement, this area holds a treasure trove of possibilities for eye-catching body artwork. Additionally, spine tattoos help accentuate the wearer's natural silhouette and are thus considered one of the sexiest locations, second only to hip and sternum tattoos. 
But before diving headfirst into the mesmerizing possibilities of a spine tattoo, it's important to be mindful of the pain level associated with inking this area. Many people wonder, do spine tattoos hurt? When tattooing your back, the proximity to your bones is a deciding factor in how much the needling hurts. In that regard, tattooing your spine can cause discomfort as it is extremely bony and sensitive due to the nerves in that area. However, if you are not a beginner and have a higher pain tolerance, you might be more willing to consider a spine tattoo.
