For more and more people, the wanderlust is real, and now might be the right moment to stop missing out and start seeing the world. International tourism is expected to recover in 2024 as travelers make up for lost time and make hay while the sun shines, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Moreover, Skyscanner’s Travel Trends 2024 report notes that nearly 2 in 5 travelers are spending more money on these getaways than in 2023.
Travelers are getting more creative too. They’re inspired by locations they’ve only seen in television and movies. They plan to eat well in exotic destinations that offer favorable exchange rates or simply invest in their R&R. Nearly a quarter of U.S. travelers told Skyscanner they plan to sleep during their downtime.
Using data from Euromonitor International’s 2023 Top 100 City Destinations index, Stacker compiled a list of the top 100 city destinations in the world. Euromonitor International assembled its 2023 index by comparing 55 metrics across six key pillars for more than 100 international cities to create an overall attractiveness ranking. The top 100 cities’ rankings across these six key pillars—economic and business performance, tourism performance, tourism policy and attractiveness, tourism infrastructure, health and safety, and sustainability—are included.
Europe claims 63 cities in the top 100, many of which seamlessly blend ancient history with new design, technology, and sustainability developments. Meanwhile, Asia also had a strong showing—with an impressive five cities in the top 20, including the first time Tokyo broke the top 10. China alone contributed eight cities to the list—including some lesser-known destinations beyond Beijing and Shanghai.
Among the eight U.S. cities ranked on this list, New York was the highest at No. 8, with Los Angeles trailing behind and barely cracking the top 20 at No. 19. Two Florida cities made the list: Miami at No. 35 and Orlando at No. 25.
Whether you’re looking for the chance to kick back on a beach, explore layers of history on foot, or taste the multitude of cultural influences that come together in an international melting pot, there is a destination on this list for you—be it just across the border or an ocean (or two) away.

Seeing Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital city, is seeing its unique history, from the first inhabitants over 10,000 years ago to its recovery after the Vietnam War. Hanoi still shows symbols of past occupation by France and China. It’s worth checking out the Old Quarter, a busy district of narrow streets where glimpses of the past come into full focus. First-time visitors to Hanoi might be daunted by all of the sights, sounds, and smells coming from various street food carts, small shops, and motorbike taxis, but this is truly the heart of Vietnam.

Located nearby is Djemaa El Fna, a famous city square that hosts performers of all kinds—acrobats, storytellers, musical artists, and comedians. Many of these ancient heritage sites were spared by a deadly earthquake that rocked the city in September 2023—but some rubble from other structures that were damaged in the temblor may still remain.

A former fishing village, Playa del Carmen is now home to the annual Riviera Maya Jazz Festival and a stretch of modern eateries, bars, and boutiques along La Quinta Avenida. You’re less likely to find spring breakers at “Playa” compared to other destinations in Mexico—although that time frame and Christmas are most popular for tourists. It’s also a port city for cruise ships. But because it offers an average of 340 sunny days a year, there’s less of a “high season” to avoid.

Most of the original city center of Thessaloniki burned down in an epic fire in 1917, but it was rebuilt around Aristotelous Square.

The still-operating Vlatadon Monastery is a relic of the Byzantine Empire. Known as the “City of Saints,” Thessaloniki was the site of the second Christian church to be established in Europe.

The entire city of Verona has been deemed a UNESCO World Heritage Site—and not just because it was the setting for Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”—although you can visit the birthplace of Giulietta Capuleti, supposedly the real-life inspiration for the protagonist. Verona’s tourism industry leans into the city’s romantic side, offering candlelit dinners, seductive vistas as seen from lookout points like Giardino Giusti, and the observation deck of the Lamberti Tower. Beyond the Roman archaeological sites, one might expect more offbeat tourist attractions, including the Museo Africano (African Museum) and one of Europe’s oldest carnivals, Bacanal del Gnoco.

What put Marne-la-Vallée, France, on the map was the arrival of Disneyland Paris in 1992—but it was originally established in the mid-1960s as part of the country’s “new towns” effort to create decentralized economic development and take some of the burden off of major city centers like Paris. Today, it’s also home to Walt Disney Studios Park, which opened as Disney-MGM Studios Europe in 2002; the Val d’Europe shopping center, which houses the Sea Life Paris Aquarium; and such academic institutions as ParisTech, ESIEE Paris engineering school, and Gustave Eiffel University.

Jerusalem isn’t just an important religious site for Judaism, Islam, and Christianity and has become a key historical and political center. Despite recent conflicts surrounding the area, most notably between Israel and Palestine, the city brims with culture and spirituality.
The Old City of Jerusalem allows visitors from throughout the world to walk from the Western Wall—the holiest site for Jews, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre—where Jesus was believed to have been crucified and then resurrected, to the Temple Mount and the Dome of the Rock—where the prophet Muhammad was believed to have ascended to heaven and the third-holiest site for Muslims.
For those who stay longer, it is worth taking day trips to the salty Dead Sea, the lowest point in the world, and Yad Vashem, Israel’s largest Holocaust memorial and museum. Yad Vashem attempts to explain the tragic events leading up to the Holocaust, provide real-life accounts and artifacts from those who survived and those who didn’t, and record and remember as many names of victims as possible.

For a more colorful experience, visit the Gamcheon Culture Village with its rainbow-colored houses impossibly perched on a steep hillside, earning it the reputation of the Machu Picchu of Busan.
There are plenty of places to explore Busan on foot—but perhaps the most thrilling is the Songdo Yonggung Suspension Bridge, which traces the ridge of a seaside cliff and extends over the water to loop around the uninhabited Dongseom Island.

One of the oldest cities on this list and outliving many dynasties, Beijing has preserved its extensive history while constantly growing and innovating. Even travelers who’ve never visited China are familiar with its sections of the Great Wall, Forbidden City, and Tiananmen Square—but these destinations are still breathtaking when seen in person.
Another site would be a typical Beijing “hutong”—crisscrossing lanes and alleys built during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Venice is truly a place like no other. The city lies upon 118 small islands, all linked together by canals or bridges—which means the way to get around is either by walking or taking a boat. The city’s structure also poses unique problems as its delicate foundation has caused the land to start sinking slowly. Additionally, high tides and strong winds could cause the canals to flood—although, in 2023, the city experienced a drought that kept water levels at bay.
Visit St. Mark’s Basilica, located on St. Mark’s Square and dedicated to the patron saint of Venice, to see a beautiful cathedral with beginnings as far back as 1063. Take a water taxi to some of the smaller islands within the city’s network to observe the making of items like glass, gondolas, leather, and lace. Finally, gondola rides can be pricey, but they offer amazing, romantic views of Venice and its lesser-known canals and are a rare experience.

Seoul, South Korea, combines aspects of South Korean culture that don’t seem to mesh at first—mountain temples and shrines, ornamental palaces, a booming Korean pop and clothing scene, and futuristic neon-lit city streets. The most popular of the palaces is Changdeokgung, built in 1405 and used well into the 20th century, which is surrounded by beautiful secret gardens.

Milan might be known as a modern metropolis and the high-end fashion capital of Italy, but the former capital of the Western Roman Empire is several thousand years old. As in Florence, one of the prettiest buildings is a cathedral—the largest Gothic complex in the world, the Duomo di Milano, which took more than 500 years to complete. However, those who want to check out the commercial life of Milan should visit the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the oldest shopping malls in the world, built in the mid-19th century, whose architecture reflects the marble, mosaic, and glass style of Milan’s other buildings.

Singapore may be the most expensive city in the world to live in. It tied with Zürich in 2023, but the “Lion City” is worth a visit for its beautiful and unusual attractions.

It’s hard to know how much Brexit has contributed to the decline in tourism to London since the United Kingdom officially split with the European Union in 2020, as it coincided with international travel restrictions. But as Britain’s cultural, economic, and transportation hub, this capital city has seen a steady stream of European tourists since 2022—despite the added paperwork necessary for some to visit after the landmark “exit.” Some of the most popular attractions include such historic sites as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and the U.K. Parliament—but you can get one of the best views of London from a more contemporary attraction, the London Eye, added to the skyline in 2000.

New York City remains the top city destination in the Western Hemisphere, attracting 56.7 million visitors in 2022. While Manhattan may be the heart of the “Big Apple” and is known worldwide as a financial, cultural, and diverse center, the island’s four surrounding boroughs each have distinct personalities and attractions. For example, Queens is known for being the most diverse county in the world, with at least 160 languages used daily. The borough of Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by the landmark Brooklyn Bridge; it is home to the country’s oldest performing arts center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music; and Coney Island, “the birthplace of the American amusement park.”

The bright lights of always-bustling Tokyo make the capital the most popular city in Japan, and there are many reasons to keep visiting, no matter the season—from the Cherry Blossom Festival in April to the beautiful light displays in Tokyo Station, Omotesando, Roppongi Hills, and throughout the city in December. Visitors come to marvel at a concert of people moving from one street to the other at Shibuya Crossing. People watch the colorfully dressed cosplayers at Yoyogi Park or relax in the city at “onsens,” or hot spring baths. Among the many popular attractions in Tokyo is Kabukiza, the main theater for the Japanese dance of kabuki, an elaborate performance with dramatic sets, outfits, and makeup.

Madrid is a lively—though old—city with an energetic population. Walking down the street, you’re likely to see buildings from the 16th century, built during the peak of the Spanish Empire or even earlier. Fans of soccer, aka football or fútbol, would enjoy a tour around Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home of the world-famous and prolific Real Madrid team.
If you want to escape the crowded city squares, check out the park El Retiro. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a great place to relax; go for a jog; rent a bike; go for a boat ride on the park’s lake in the summer; or even admire Madrid’s oldest tree, which has been alive since 1633.

Even travelers who have never been to the City of Lights have heard about its many landmarks and attractions, such as the unmistakable Eiffel Tower, the beautiful and gigantic Musée du Louvre—the most-visited museum in the world, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by fire in 2019 and lost its wooden roof and spire. People worldwide raised money in support, and this famous landmark is closed for renovations until its estimated reopening date in December 2024. Though the reconstruction timeline won’t line up with the expected deluge of visitors coming for the 2024 Summer Olympics, visitors may just leave this romantic city with a desire to return.
