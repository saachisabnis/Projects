	Post Malone’s country debut, “F-1 Trillion,” is the No. 1 album in the United States. The sprawling collection of 18 songs — featuring everyone from Dolly Parton and Hank Williams Jr. to vets like Tim McGraw and Blake Shelton — zooms in with 250,000 equivalent album units earned, according to data research company Luminate.

	“F-1 Trillion” logged 213 million streams and 80,000 copies sold as a complete unit, with its deluxe reissue — an additional nine-song set nicknamed the “Long Bed” edition — having been released on Aug. 16. The Texas native started as a singer before he became a rapper, and he previously scored two No. 1 albums with “Hollywood’s Bleeding” in 2019, and “Beerbongs & Bentleys” in 2018.

	“F-1 Trillion” was preceded by the crossover hit “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen. The latter is the No. 2 song on the latest Billboard Hot 100 song ranking, and was his first solo No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart since “Circles” in 2019. Post has been a mainstay on the Top 10 of the Billboard charts for a majority of the year thanks to his part in two of the year’s biggest albums: Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter” and Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department.”

	Moving on, Chappell Roan’s “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” continues for a second week at No. 2, earning 72,000 equivalent album units. Swift’s “Tortured Poets” is at No. 3 as Wallen’s chart-topping 2023 album, “One Thing at a Time,” moves to No. 4 and Billie Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft” moves down one spot to No. 5.

	Zach Bryan’s “The Great American Bar Scene” is at No. 6; Charli XCX’s “Brat” is at No. 7; Noah Kahan’s “Stick Season” is No. 8; Wallen’s “Dangerous: The Double Album” is No. 9; and Bryan’s self-titled LP rounds out the top at No. 10.

	The only new release on the Hot 100 songs chart this week is Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga’s “Die With a Smile,” which opens at No. 3 with 27 million streams and 13 million in radio reach. The list is led by Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which adds a seventh nonconsecutive week at No. 1 as the longest-leading single of 2024 so far.
