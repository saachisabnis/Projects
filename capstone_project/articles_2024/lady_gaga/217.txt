Lady Gaga pledges to be an "antidote" and "cure your disease" in her newest single from her upcoming album. 
The hitmaker dropped her new song "Disease" on Friday (October 25), the lead single to her so far untitled forthcoming album, known as LG7, that will arrive in February 2025, per Pitchfork. The album will be a follow-up to 2020's Chromatica; however she also recently dropped a new project called Harlequin, a companion album for her film Joker: Folie Ã  Deux. 
"Disease" features Gaga's signature style and powerful vocals paired with an edgy, theatrical sound, metal clangs, and driving beat as she sings, "Poison on the inside, I could be your antidote tonight," overlaid with a spoken voice track echoing the lyrics before leading into the chorus, "I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease. If you were a sinner, I could make you believe. Lay you down like 1, 2, 3, eyes roll back in ecstasy. I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya, cure your disease."
Though she hasn't dropped an official music video, fans got a preview of what to expect earlier this week when Gaga shared a clip of what appeared to be someone in a car chasing her down as she ran for her life.
