Sept. 15th marked the 76th annual Primetime Emmy Awards show — a night of praise for the year’s best from the television industry. Stars sashay on and off the stage, receiving physical awards for the most outstanding television series and the leading, supporting, guest or even voice-over actors that made those series worthy. The night seemingly honors all artistic forms, long and short — except for fashion. Thus, there’s been enough “thanking the academy;” it’s time to thank the stars that make the Red Carpet a traditionally entertaining aspect of Hollywood’s big night.
Most old-fashioned: Dan Levy
Literally following in his father’s footsteps, “Schitt’s Creek”actor Dan Levy was a shining presence as he co-hosted the awards with Eugene Levy. Their theme centered around age and time, which was reflected not only in their dynamic but also in Dan’s fashion choices. 
While his suit might have seemed plain at first glance, the extravagant one-sided popped collar texture added a touch of 1920s dapper flair, elevating his look and feel. Despite its innovative design, the collar could be seen as an eyesore due to its unnecessary updo, almost resembling a tissue (at least he’s prepared for any unexpected crying). However, despite this unfortunate configuration, Levy’s fashion choices did not prevent him from delivering one of the most captivating Emmys ceremonies to date.

Most likely to repurpose their outfit for a Halloween decoration: Greta Lee 
Greta Lee arrived at the Emmys in a decidedly bridal Loewe lace dress constituting the trinity: the father, the son and the holy spirit, an Emmy nomination, her first one, in fact. With the help of her stylist, Danielle Goldberg, the actresses’ Emmys ensembles are known to embody understated sophistication, dating back to her iridescent Christopher John Rogers red carpet co-ord in 2017. The look, rather ahead of its time, exhibited the bubble skirt that reached virality this summer, seven years later. Adoration for Loewe and Lee’s pioneering vision aside, the cowl neck number simply swallows the star, and spurs thoughts of decorative cobwebs, rather than couture. Maybe we’ll understand in seven years?

Most likely to be President Barbie: Meryl Streep
Strutting down in her finest pink pantsuit, Meryl Streep made a grand entrance, channeling the spirit of the pink-infested-women’s-empowerment era that dominated the “Barbie” summer of 2023. Nominated for her role as a supporting actress in “Only Murders in the Building,” she has all the reason to exude the same empowered charm on the red carpet.
Pretty in pink, Streep carried a petite baby pink handbag to match her all-blush and ultra-feminine suit. Attention to detail is vital in this ensemble, as the renowned actress even snuck in pink-rimmed glasses and a shimmering pink pedicure to fully embrace the theme.
While adding some more intricate details to the pantsuit could have taken the outfit to the next level, Streep’s confident demeanor nonetheless made heads turn with her elegant and empowered fashion choice.

Biggest “basket”-case: Kristen Wiig 
Looking handwoven in the best way possible, Wiig stunned in a metallic gown that met the volume and thickness criteria of the baskets featured in the Pottery Barn catalog. With three nominations for the “Saturday Night Live” and “Palm Royale”star, some may have assumed her strategy of dressing like the award was a manifestation tactic (Respect, Kristen). Though she may have to turn to divine adoption, or ask Jamie Lee Curtis of “The Bear” what her secret is, because twelve nominations in, the only win Wiig has had is on the red carpet.

Most likely to sneak in a protein shake into the Emmys: Tyler James Williams
From childhood stardom to now being one of the most recognized actors in American comedy, Tyler James Williams made another rodeo around the Emmys red carpet with a nomination for his supporting role in “Abbott Elementary.”
Male red carpet fashion has always been somewhat taboo, with viewers quick to criticize the typical basic suit and its lack of innovation. Unfortunately, Williams is no stranger to this scrutiny. Giving the impression of someone who just came from a workout session, his choice of presentation fell short. While his sleeveless shirt is not as unsatisfactory as other male actors’ outfits seen that night, Williams missed the mark in following this distinctive red carpet-fashion tradition.

Most likely to play himself off the stage with a bagpipe: Alan Cummings 
Renowned for his eccentric color choices, and bold pattern mixing, it is no surprise that Alan Cummings did not come to play this Emmys season. The Scottish actor isno stranger to plaid or kilts when hosting the reality competition show “Traitors,” which garnered him two Emmys this year. If the two awards and the two-tone outfit, met with the drapery of a plaid shawl, wasn't enough to generate some buzz, Cummings was quick to enter the “Who wore it better” ring with the only other tartan-touting star, Taylor Swift, who has proudly sported the print since 2012. Just four days before the Emmys, Swift was magnificently accoutered at the VMAs in a yellow plaid Dior ensemble. Put rather straightforwardly by Cummings, “B— stole my look.”

Most DIY-chic: Devery Jacobs
Making an enthralling Lady Gaga-esque entrance to the red carpet, “Reservation Dogs”actress Devery Jacobs may have presented one of the most resourceful outfits of the night. 
The outfit, blending tulle and a suit, exuded the makeshift essence of a 2012 DIY YouTube video — which could be interpreted as either a bold choice or a miss. The tulle undeniably hindered the outfit’s intended impact. Its unconventional and haphazard design gave the impression of a last-minute creation, unfortunately detracting from the overall intended fashion statement.
Nonetheless, Jacob’s confidence, updo and pantsuit brought out her inner girlboss, upholding her ability to make bold choices without compromising her self-assurance and poise.

Most demure: Elizabeth Debicki 
“Demure,” the Tiktok-coined word of the month, is exactly what Elizabeth Debicki conveyed at the Emmys as she donned a clean and simple, yet breathtaking black silhouette. The dress, reminiscent of the Chanel 1940s archives, is demonstrative of timelessness, particularly in a setting in which over-the-top silhouettes and statements have been made the norm. Debicki may have been channeling the role she was nominated for, as she walked away with gold for her portrayal of Princess Diana in Netflix's “The Crown”. Certainly representing all that is regal, Debicki is the ultimate example of committing to the bit.

Most likely to spend hours on their outfit: Chris Perfetti
Having a natural flair for fashion and self-expression, Chris Perfetti, known for his role in “Abbott Elementary,” consistently pushes the boundaries when it comes to red carpet attire. While his character on the show is limited to basic dress pants and collared shirts as an elementary school teacher, public events serve as his opportunity to truly showcase his unique fashion sense.
As expected, Perfetti turned heads with one of the most captivating male outfits of the night, evoking a distinct “straight-out-of-the-sea” vibe reminiscent of Eric from “The Little Mermaid.” Adorned with textured ruffles and featuring transparent linen sleeves, his ensemble was anything but ordinary, setting a high standard for innovative design that many male actors failed to achieve.

Most prepared for battle: Lily Gladstone 
Lily Lannister – sorry, I mean, Gladstone, arrived at the Emmys in a warrior’s fashion, prepared to battle for one ​​Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie Award. Losing the battle, the “Under The Bridge” actress won the war — for “Best Chest Plate” (Nobody else competed). The acclaimed actress has been met with praise for her role as a police officer who investigated the murder of a teenage girl, but she’s still insistent on wearing the bulletproof vest — there’s security at the Emmys, Lily.

Most likely to enter a reputation era: Quinta Brunson
With a resume that could constitute multiple lives, “Emmy-winning actress and writer” is only one piece of the puzzle for Quinta Brunson’s never-ending list of aptitudes. 
As the creator and star of one of contemporary television's most talked-about comedy shows, Brunson's outfit must be equally remarkable—she must stand out. While a few more details in her dress’s accents could have taken her chic style to the next level, the sophisticated yet unique design of her latex black dress and dark eyeliner gives her the aura of a mysterious emo mermaid. Flapping her fins across the red carpet, Brunson stunned with one of the night's best looks.

Most likely to be crowned Prom Queen: Reese Witherspoon 
“The Morning Show” leading lady and producer evoked nostalgia in a strapless black Dior dress. The bodice, complete with delicate floral detailing, descended into a tulle skirt. Though interviewers on the red carpet gushed over Witherspoon’s ode to Old Hollywood glamour, one might be forgiven for mistaking the garment hanging off the five-foot-one actress, for an ensemble unearthed from the moth-eaten archives of high school proms past.
