It was seriously a show for the memory books! Payton's Dad had us on the floor not to mention new LADY GAGA today (if ya heard us LIVE on KISS at all this morning) the vibes were right. So First things first, IT'S FRIDAYYY and JOHNJAYS GOT A GAME FOR YOUUU (MONSTER EDITION) will you know the answers? Then, TRISH calls us with an update on last night's "DATE" with her "FRIEND" and then we hear from someone who was ALMOST murdered listening to our show 1 year ago!!! Plus, Testing out that Viral Phone Prank, Jenna being a groupie at the Dua Lipa Set and MUCHÂ  MUCH MORE!
