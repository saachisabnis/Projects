Lady Gaga is on the promotional tour for her latest film role in “Joker: Folie a Deux.” She’s hitting red carpet events for film festivals, popping up at screenings and doing press interviews. She’s even released a companion album. And though she isn’t necessarily method dressing for every stop, the famously 5′ 1″ performer is sticking with platform heels for each look so far, and there is undoubtedly more in store before the film hits theaters in October.
The “Me and You” singer’s latest look was in London. Attending the photocall for the film, she fully embraced the method dressing trend of late and decided to go for a Harley Quinn effect. To do so, she died her hair red and wore a black and white Marc Jacobs dress with a lace collar.

For shoes, Gaga chose a pair of massively high Kiki boots from the designer. The shoes are the ankle version and buckle up the front of the foot in a series of three straps. Under them, Gaga wore a pair of sheer knee-high socks.
The star made a major impression when she hit the red carpet for the Venice Film Festival earlier this month. She pumped up the volume in a massive black Christian Dior custom couture gown and a dramatic Phillip Treacy headpiece. But she complimented it all with a towering pair of Giuseppe Zanotti lace up boots featuring a narrow stiletto heel. The boots gave her the necessary height to pull off the look.
There were two photocalls at the Venice International Film Festival for “Joker: Folie A Deux.” For the both, Gaga went restrained. She wore a black velvet tea-length dress featuring a square neckline and small veiled cap, both from Dior.. She pumped up her height with a pair of Christian Louboutin Daffodile pumps. The shoes are leather and feature an increasingly narrow stiletto that boasts the brand’s signature red sole. 

 









For the second photocall, she kept things demure. The performer went all black in a simple tucked in T-shirt and trousers. Under the wide leg trousers she wore a pair of platform black stilettos made of suede that peeked through the bottom of her pant leg. She also wore a pair of shades from Celine.
