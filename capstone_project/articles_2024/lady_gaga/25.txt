Jessica Bielattends the special screening of Universal Pictures’ “Trolls: Band Together” at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 15, 2023 in Hollywood, California.
Jessica Biel is trying to start a new movement by having snacks in the shower. The Candy star posted a TikTok at the end of 2023, which seemed to inspire users on the platform about the weird personal passion. Biel, 41, said in her video that she loves to eat and drink in the shower. However, the mother of two sticks to what she thinks are shower-appropriate items. Biel lists cereal, popsicles, yogurt, tea, and coffee as her favorites. As she noted, if it drops or melts, it can easily go down the drain.
In response to a fan, Biel made a follow-up video last week explaining how she tackles consuming in an environment that would get everything wet. The question that the fan posed read: "I need her to explain HOW she eats said 'shower appropriate' items without getting water in it??" According to her, a ledge is quite helpful for placing down coffee or yogurt in the middle of your wash. "It's pretty simple, guys. You can do this," she urged. "I find it deeply satisfying." She then pointed out some obvious tips for the concerned fans flooding the comments, like keeping your mouth closed while chewing under the water. She concluded, "Enjoy your shower consuming." While the admission seems weird to some fans, others -- particularly moms -- could relate. As one parent commented, "I got four kids, they eat my food, I stand behind this 100 percent since it’s the only place I have privacy." Another agreed, "It’s the only place you can probably eat without having to share with kids."
Still, she didn't sell some people on the concept of cereal shower snacks. "Cereal? Without Milk? Does the water get in the bowl?" a comment read. "[Too] many questions." Fortunately, it's not that serious. As Biel quipped in one of her captions, "(Shower) food for thought…" Seemingly appropriate, the actress' TikTok bio reads: "I’m sorry in advance for anything I post here."
March signifies the month of rebirth, as we exit winter and enter spring with a fresh start. There are so many celebrities who are born in March, being either a Pisces (March 1 to March 20) or an Aries (March 21 to March 31). March Pisces' energy is usually associated with being empathetic, competitive and ethereal. This sign makes incredible artists and creatives. Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, making it the most wise and psychic of all the other signs. There is much to be learned by Pisces, who tend to live half in a dream state. Represented by two fish swimming in opposite directions, the constant division of Pisces's attention between fantasy and reality is seen as this yin yang symbol.
Meanwhile, Aries are the first sign of the zodiac, so they tend to be raw with their needs, wants and emotions. Fiery Aries are bold and ambitious, and when it comes to some of our favorite stars and directors, it is thrilling to watch.
See below which of your favorite stars have a March birthday!
