There’s not enough dance nights supplying “non-stop ass-shakers” these days, and All 4 U knows it. With a tagline culled straight from a timeless Janet Jackson bop, Boston’s new “queer pop party” pops off at O’Brien’s Pub in Allston tonight (April 3) with a frenetic blend of hyper-pop, electro, and ’80s throwbacks.
The promo for All 4 U — whose logo is currently formatted like the placeholder cover art for Charli XCX’s album Brat, a green flag if there ever was one — touts an immaculate variety of artists in rotation. Indeed, every name on the flyer can be filed under “ass shaker,” spanning icons (Prince, Madonna, Mariah Carey) and electronica mavericks (SOPHIE and Shygirl). Boston alt-pop is also on the docket; area performers Vim and Velvet Dreaming (pictured above) will take the stage for brief performances in between DJ sets. 
Not to be blasphemous, but we’re pretty sure this is exactly what Lady Gaga pictured when she said she was on “The Edge of Glory.” Check out the flyer and grab tickets below.
