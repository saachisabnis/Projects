Buddy, watch your back
Reneé Rapp is quickly becoming maybe one of the internet’s most beloved interviewees for her blase, no-filter attitude during the  Mean Girls movie musical press tour.
The press junket is part and parcel of the Hollywood star’s life, having to repeatedly answer the same questions from the same hungry reporters about their latest project. Some have complained about it. Most lump it and give out the same responses. Something about how the part resonated with them, how they loved their time on set, what they learnt about themselves or their craft. Maybe a sneak peek into their personal lives, but always very controlled. But sometimes, someone comes along and creates a moment where we all talk for weeks. Think Lady Gaga’s entire press tour for House of Gucci. Honestly, if that movie were as good as her quotes to journalists, it would have swept at the Academy Awards.
The latest sprinkling of that fairy dust comes from Reneé, who brings Regina George to life in the movie musical adaptation of the 2004 teen comedy of the same name. The story – which largely mirrors the 00s original with Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert with some tunes thrown with a Gen Z update – follows homeschooled new girl Cady Heron’s move from Africa to a suburban high school and its unfamiliar world of social politics.
Reneé’s cinematic turn as the coolest girl in school comes after she brought her to life in the Broadway stage show. The movie’s script – which is in theatres now – comes from the same mind of Tina Fey, along with songs from her composer husband, Jeff Richmond. The cast list includes American comedy icons such as Jenna Fischer, Busy Phillips, Tim Meadows and Jon Hamm.
During chats with the press, her unfiltered personality and distinct lack of Hollywood polish shine through. Her honesty, from everything from terrible bus operators to misogyny in Hollywood, has got everyone talking about what a breath of fresh air.
Here are the best moments from Reneé Rapp on the Mean Girls movie musical press tour! 
I’m happy #MeanGirls THE MUSICAL MOVIE was made because, if it hadn’t been, we’d be missing out on Reneé Rapp absolutely *obliterating* this bus tour company owner named Buddy. pic.twitter.com/ruVk2cS9Bk

In the clip, Reneé made her feelings towards a “disrespectful” and “misogynistic” owner of a tour bus company very well known as she labelled him “such an asshole” for how he had treated her, her mother Denise, along with her pals Bella and Priscilla.
“There is this man who owns a bus touring company. His name is Buddy, and he is such an asshole,” she said. “I hate you. Fuck you, Buddy.”
While she cusses him out, her co-star and co-interviewee Christopher Briney struggled to keep his laughter inside. Who knows if his reaction is inspired by second-hand cringeworthy or genuine laughter?

While sitting down with Extra to promote the new edition of Mean Girls, Reneé got online chatter going with her ire for the rapper’s ex-Tory Lanez. Renee, who is also a bonafide pop girly with the debut of her album Snow Angel last year, raged about how much  “hate” she had for that “other man”. She is widely believed to be talking about Megan’s ex, who was found guilty of shooting Megan last year.
Reneé also praised her friend, dubbing her “the coolest” after they collaborated on the Mean Girls tie-in track Not My Fault.
“She’s the coolest, and I’m such a huge fan of hers. I’m a true, true Meg supporter and I hate that other man. I love Megan Thee Stallion. I love her. And if anybody tries her when it comes to that sorry-ass man, it’s a do-or-die fight for me,” Renee said.
Reneé, who has been open about being bisexual, continued her out and proud ways by singing the praises of the LGBT+ community. However, she also admitted that she might be a bit “biased” but on the whole that“gay people are just like, generally cooler and better,” before adding “no offense, I love you” to Christopher, who plays Regina’s on-off boyfriend Aaron Samuels in the flick.

Reneé marked her 24th birthday by appearing on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on January 10th but also found the time to party, letting us all in on the Dom Perignon-soaked celebrations on Instagram. Underneath a bleary-eyed photo of her in the car that took her to the studio, the caption read: “fell before I was drunk happy birthday to me.”
Going to see mean girls tonight and plan to experience it the way Reneé Rapp would want- drunk

Reneé was not shy in her obsession with the actress who played her role of the high school’s queen bee in the 2004 original. During her chat with Stephen Colbert, she was asked if she had any notes for Rachel.
“Any notes for her? Date me?,” Reneé told Stephen and was met with rapturous appulse before adding that she “might be watching, you never know.”

The stand-up comic bombed while hosting the 81st annual Golden Globes for making what many considered to be misogynist jokes about Taylor Swift, the Barbie movie and other topics, and Reneé didn’t hold back about much his set displeased her.
She declared her ins and outs while appearing in a TikTok for Today show with the rest of the Plastics, made up of Angourie Rice, Avantika and Bebe Wood. Keeping true to herself,Reneé has more than one annoyance, firstly coming  for the man who told her to “smile” before taking aim at Jo, saying, “And also my out is the man that was making a bunch of jokes about women last night at the Golden Globes.”

Reneé took the initiative to post that her latest venture was available for your viewing pleasure via her own Instagram, writing in the caption of a tear-stained snap that “mean girls out in theatres now”. The tongue-in-cheek reference to high school, a tear-stained aftermath of Homecoming, was perhaps a very vulnerable way to go about it. She could have shown us the before!
