I believe in Harvey Dent.

Harley Quinn may not be the only iconic Batman villain joining the Clown Prince of Crime in Joker: Folie à Deux. Closed captioning for the upcoming DC film points to Harvey Dent, also known as Two-Face, appearing in the sequel, as well.
On X, DiscussingFilm shared an image of Dent's name showing up in the closed captioning for Joker 2's official trailer. This option has now been disabled on YouTube, so it seems Warner Bros. is attempting to keep this under wraps for now. Early on in the video, Dent apparently says: "They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr. Well, he's not. He's a monster."

The new Joker 2 trailer promises a mad-love musical and highlights that Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is being put on trial. So it's possible that Dent could be the district attorney looking to lock him up. Additionally, in 2022, Joker 2 added Harry Lawtey to the cast in reportedly a notable role. No other details on Lawtey's character were shared at the time.
Meanwhile, Lady Gaga is portraying Quinn and her character's relationship with Fleck will serve as a main plotline for Joker 2. Other cast members for the DC film include Zazie Beetz, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, Steve Coogan, and Ken Leung.
Joker: Folie à Deux is set to premiere in international theaters October 2, while arriving in the US on October 4. For more, check out everything we know about the DC movie sequel.
