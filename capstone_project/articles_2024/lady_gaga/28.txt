Lady Gaga has a lot to be thankful for this year, such as working on new music for LG7 and releasing her forthcoming film Joker: Folie à Deux as well as a companion album. Another big life change is that she got engaged to her now-fiancé Michael Polansky. Now, she's giving a special shoutout to her mother for helping lead her to him.
The "Born this Way" singer recently sat down with Entertainment Tonight where she spoke about sharing the experience of premiering the Joker sequel at the Venice Film Festival with Polansky by her side earlier this month. 
"It was extremely special to share that moment with him and for us to go out as a couple together, I love him so much," she said, before praising her mom for helping them connect. "My mom really did good advising me... She found him. He's amazing."
In the September cover story for Vogue, Gaga revealed that her mother met Polanksy first in 2019 and immediately knew he would be the perfect match for her daughter, telling Gaga at the time, "I think I just met your husband." The "Poker Face" hitmaker ended up meeting Polanksy later that year at a mutual friend's party and they talked for hours and soon began dating, going on to quarantine together in 2020. 
Polanksy proposed in April 2024, around the time she first sparked engagement rumors after being seen wearing a "massive diamond ring," but it was until she was chatting with French prime minister at the Paris Olympics that she confirmed Polansky as her fiancé.
