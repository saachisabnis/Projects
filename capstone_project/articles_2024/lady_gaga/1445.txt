Kanye West and Drake‘s beef has been reignited in recent days, with the Yeezy rapper now claiming that the Toronto native has a “rich baby daddy” — a sly reference to Drizzy’s song with Sexyy Red and SZA — in British record executive Sir Lucian Grainge.
Grainge, who is the CEO of Universal Music Group and has been responsible for the signings of some of the biggest names in music including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Kanye himself, was mentioned in West’s remix of Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That” remix, which takes shots at both Drake and J. Cole.

But as he claimed in an interview with Justin Laboy on The Download podcast, the $400 million deal Drizzy struck with the powerhouse company two years ago came at the expense of his very soul.
“Drake has a rich baby daddy named Lucian and Universal,” he said to the popular social media personality. “He’s like, ‘Man, my daddy got it!’ You know what I’m saying? ‘My daddy control the spins! My daddy got the DSPs!’ Drake has a rich baby daddy. Lucian work for the people who control the banks in Africa.”

West also suggested that his falling out with the 6 God — with whom he seemingly reconciled at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert in late 2022 — had a more celestial origin.
“It cuts Drake’s soul,” he continued. “It’s like he signed his soul to the Devil to not be cool with me. This is his job, to go against God.”
Elsewhere in the interview, Kanye West explained how his “Like That (Remix)” came about and referred to the current rap war as “the elimination of Drake.”
“Pluto called me, I went to the studio and laid that,” he said. “Everybody was very, very excited about the elimination of Drake. Not excited — we was energized.”

The song, which premiered on The Download this past weekend and has since been released on YouTube, opens with Ye siding with Kendrick Lamar in his beef against Drake: “Yo Dot, I got you.”
He later takes aim at Drizzy and Cole directly, rapping: “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind/ I can’t even think of a Drake line/ Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry.”

Kanye also appears to reference Diddy’s sexual assault allegations by spitting: “Can’t stop, won’t stop/ I just fucked your bitch in a Sean John tank top.”
The remix surfaced shortly after Drake released a second diss track aimed at Kendrick called “Taylor Made Freestyle,” which features the artificially generated voices of both 2Pac and Snoop Dogg.

He previously took shots at K. Dot — as well as other foes such as Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross and The Weeknd — on “Push Ups,” which came in response to Lamar’s own disses on the original “Like That.”
