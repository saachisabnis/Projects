Lady Gaga and fiancé Michael Polansky are thinking about their big day — but may be making things very demure, very cutesy, or are they?
In a recent appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," when asked about any plans for upcoming nuptials, the pop star said, “We actually talk about going to the courthouse just the two of us and ordering Chinese food." But, a big wedding is not totally off the table, as she added, "Knowing me, also, it could become like a circus with unicorns."
Gaga and Polansky got engaged several months ago with the tech investor proposing not long after the pop superstar's March birthday. She explained, "He proposed to me right after my birthday. So my birthday passed, and I was like, 'Well, I thought he was going to purpose, but then maybe...'"
Polansky actually popped the question during a rock climbing trip. Lady G told Jimmy, "He actually threw me a beautiful birthday dinner and then we went on a trip together and we went rock climbing and we'd been rock climbing before, which was super fun." She added, "He didn't propose to me at the top. We climbed up to the top and we looked around and we took some photos, and then we went back down and we were just walking back to the room and talking. And he said, he actually was very Michael to ask me if he could ask me. He wanted to know if it was okay to propose before he proposed, and I was like, 'Yes, it's so okay.'"
And, finally, when they reached the bottom, he pulled out the ring and proposed. Hear all the details below in her interview on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" below.
