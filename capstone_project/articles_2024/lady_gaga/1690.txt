Lady Gaga‘s fiancé, Michael Polansky, isn’t a musician, but he is listed as a co-writer of her latest hit, “Disease.” So what was his contribution to the song? One line in particular, according to Gaga.
Speaking about “Disease” on Rolling Stone‘s The Breakdown series, Gaga says, “Working with Michael is super, super interesting because he knows me so well. When we were working on ‘Disease,’ I was navigating my way through some of the initial lyrics that we had written in the studio: ‘I could play the doctor. I can cure your disease.'”
Gaga continues, “He said, ‘You know, there’s another way for you to say this.’ He said, ‘Bring me your desire, I can cure your disease,’ because the thing that you are asking is to fix you, to fix this addict-like affliction that you have for this person.’”
She notes, “That’s a super intimate thing that someone might not think of or feel working with me unless they really know me.” It’s not clear what else Polansky contributed to the song.
“Disease” is the first single from Gaga’s upcoming seventh studio album, which is due out in February. Describing the album, she tells Rolling Stone, “There’s moments where we are sonically just trying to push sound as much as possible. There’s other moments where it’s all about love, and it’s super dreamy. That, to me, is true chaos.”
