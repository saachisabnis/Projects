This is no joke! Director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix are back for their Joker sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, and this time they have their very own Harley Quinn in the form of Lady Gaga.
Check out the teaser trailer…
The movie looks set to start in Arkham Asylum where Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) seems to form a love connection with Gaga’s Harley Quinn.
The trailer certainly looks to have musical theatre elements to it, though Phillips said at the recent Cinema Con that though he doesn’t consider Joker: Folie à Deux a musical, that music is an essential element to the film. 
We’ll give you more info when we have it!
Joker: Folie à Deux will be released across the UK on 4th October 2024 by Warner Bros. Pictures
