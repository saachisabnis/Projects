I can’t even begin to explain to you how difficult it has been to determine the best perfumes for women of 2024. I can attest that with hundreds of fragrances on the market, discovering the best is a process of elimination, and the line between good and great almost undetectable. To create this list for you, we considered a few things: a scent’s ability to tell a story through its notes, the craftsmanship that goes into it, and the emotions (and reactions!) it evokes. Some extraordinary blends that stand out above the rest are from the legacy labels you’d expect—long-held classics coveted since their debut nearly a century ago, while others are from contemporary newcomers offering a modern take on the fragrance landscape. Ahead, Vogue’s guide to the best perfumes for women, plus, how to choose the right one for you.

As someone who has made all the rookie mistakes when buying perfume—shopping after hours, buying without trying, getting drawn in by a pretty bottle without considering the juice—I’ve lost considerable amounts of time searching in vain. Fragrance is subjective; there are plenty of perfectly lovely, completely inoffensive releases that fail to excite me and much-lauded classics that should stay in the past. What interests me are the scents that diverge from the norm and feel singular in their intent. They don’t need to be esoteric niche creations or designer exclusives that break the bank; they just have to be original.
In choosing a women’s perfume, it’s helpful to have an idea of what fragrance profiles you enjoy. Do you gravitate towards floral notes or prefer rich musky aromas? Are you interested in something long-lasting signature scent, or would you consider layering a few fragrances to smell like “you?” In any case, the moment’s five-star, top-tier standouts are perfumes that go beyond basic.
There are timeless aromas that speak for themselves, like Chanel No. 5 or reinterpretations of classic florals like Frédéric Malle’s Portrait of a Lady—two best-selling perfumes that never go out of style. Many of which, like Dior J’adore or Marc Jacobs Daisy are so popular they've been reimagined several times over the years. On the other hand, there are even recent additions to the marketplace that are changing the way we think about fragrance, like Yasmin Sewell’s Vyrao or Michelle Pfeiffer’s Henry Rose, which maintains a clean, transparent approach—free of less-than-desirable ingredients. My favorites you ask? Baccarat Rouge 540 is a no-brainer, cozy yet sensual scent perfect for a night out. During the day, Jo Malone’s Peony & Blush Suede provides a much-needed pick-me-up.
All these and more, below. Read on to learn about the best perfumes for women that are elevated and special—and at the end of the day, that’s what everyone is searching for.
Those just starting their fragrance journeys might wonder what’s the difference between eau de toilette and eau de parfum? The latter “generally contains between 15% and 20% of fragrance oil,” according to Linda Levy, founder of The Fragrance Foundation. She continues that these scents last around four to five hours.
“The term eau de toilette came from the French term—faire sa toilette—which means getting ready,” explains Levy, noting that these are for a quick burst of scent, lasting between two to three hours. According to her, eau de toilettes “are a much lighter than eau de parfums and have a fragrance concentration between 5% and 15%.”
