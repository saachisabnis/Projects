A new Joker: Folie á Deux poster is out now, previewing both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga in full garb as the Joker and Harley Quinn. 
The latest poster doesn’t show off too much besides both characters dressed up in their iconic roles. Phoenix is dressed in his full Joker outfit from the original film, while Lady Gaga can be seen wearing makeup on her face and a shirt that’s reminiscent of Harley Quinn’s diamond checkered pattern outfit from her other iterations. 
Check out the new Joker: Folie á Deux poster below: 
Joker: Folie á Deux is directed by Todd Phillips, who also directed 2019’s Joker movie. Prior to that, Phillips primarily directed comedy movies, including 2003’s Old School, 2004’s Starsky & Hutch, 2009’s The Hangover, 2010’s Due Date, 2011’s The Hangover Part II, 2013’s The Hangover Part III, and 2016’s War Dogs.
The first Joker movie was released in October 2019. It was a massive hit for Warner Bros. Pictures, bringing in approximately $1.079 billion at the global box office off an estimated $55 million budget. It was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, with Phoenix winning Best Actor and Hildur Guðnadóttir winning Best Original Score.
Joker was originally intended to be a stand-alone film; however, Phillips announced in June 2022 that a sequel was officially happening. Joker: Folie á Deux is set in a different continuity than James Gunn and Peter Safran’s forthcoming DCU, which officially kicks off this coming December with an animated Creature Commandos series.
The screenplay for Joker 2 was co-written by Phillips and Scott Silver, both of whom also wrote the first film.
