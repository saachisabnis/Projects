Olympic officials were left blushing after a gaffe during the Paris opening ceremony caused quite a stir.
Breaking with tradition, the ceremony was staged on the River Seine rather than in a stadium, with athletes from all participating nations being showcased on boats under the relentless Parisian downpour.
The sports stars congregated in a temporary venue at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, where Olympic head Thomas Bach and French PM Gabriel Attal presided over the event.
During the ceremony, as the Olympic flag was hoisted, it became apparent to sharp-eyed viewers that it was upside down, prompting immediate reactions online.
One spectator tweeted, "Oh god is the flag upside down? " while another commented, "The big spectacle was washed out by the weather, the display was cringe and to top it all off the Olympic flag was hoisted upside down at the zenith of it all.", reports the Mirror.
Typically, the flag's blue, black, and red rings are positioned above the yellow and green ones, but this order was flipped as the flag ascended into the Paris sky.
Earlier, Lady Gaga had wowed the audience with her performance, and Celine Dion delivered a breathtaking finale atop the Eiffel Tower.
More than 300 British athletes are set to compete in the Games, with many present at the ceremony, including Team GB's flag bearers Tom Daley and Helen Glover.
Basketball legend LeBron James, alongside tennis sensation Coco Gauff, served as flag bearers for the USA.
