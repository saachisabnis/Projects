Michigan voters turned out in record numbers for Tuesday's general election, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson confirmed in a social media post Wednesday. 
More than 5.6 million Michiganders voted, or 79% of active voters in the state, Benson said. The turnout topped the 5.5 million people who voted in 2020 presidential election.
“Michiganders were able to cast their ballots safely, securely and conveniently. As in past elections, we saw thousands of new voters register and vote on Election Day, nearly 22,000 overall, and many were in East Lansing, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, and here in Detroit,” Benson said in a news conference earlier Wednesday. 
“These numbers were the result of voter education efforts and programs we implemented, along with partners in the business community, the faith community and many others throughout the state who helped every citizen have rightly placed faith in participating in our elections.” 
The state is still waiting for overseas ballots to be returned before releasing final numbers. As long as the ballots are postmarked by Election Day and received by Tuesday, they will be counted. 
Election Day went smoothly for most municipalities with little disruption to voting, despite Michigan being the target of bogus threats and misinformation. 
Benson said Washtenaw, Wayne, Genesee and Saginaw counties received non-credible bomb threats, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation said appeared to originate from Russian email domains. 
“Election integrity is among the FBI’s highest priorities. We will continue to work closely with our state and local law enforcement partners to respond to any threats to our elections and to protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,” according to a Tuesday statement by the agency. 
President-elect Donald Trump made unsubstantiated claims on his social media platform, Truth Social, that there was heavy law enforcement in Detroit and Philadelphia on Election Day, but according to the Associated Press, Detroit Police reported no issues at Huntington Place, where votes were being counted. 
“Those false claims were easily debunked, and I'm grateful to so many of our partners for helping us ensure trusted information ruled the day,” Benson said.

Republican Donald Trump will return to the White House and Republicans seem poised to flip the Michigan House as part of a big night for conservatives nationwide. 
Michigan ballots are still being counted, but current returns suggest trouble for state Democrats, who are on track to lose several key races but are holding out hope for the US Senate seat and won two state Supreme Court races.
With vote totals still being reported as of early Wednesday, here’s what we do — and don’t — know about where certain races stand in Michigan.
With 97% of the vote counted in Michigan, Trump leads Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the state by about 91,000 votes, according to a tally by The Associated Press.
The state has not yet been called for the former president (now president-elect), but partial results show Harris underperformed President Joe Biden’s 2020 showing in the state, having lost ground among Arab American and suburban voters as Trump gained support in several regions. 
Harris’ needed all three of the so-called “blue wall” states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — in order to secure victory. But Trump won the latter two states to secure an Electoral College victory. 
Trump went on to declare victory nationally just before 3 a.m., telling supporters he would not rest “until we deliver the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve.” 
As Michigan continues to count ballots into Wednesday Morning, Republican Mike Rogers and Democrat Elissa Slotkin remain neck and neck in the race to replace outgoing US Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing.
As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Slotkin held an incredibly tiny lead over Rogers. Both had urged supporters to be patient and were expecting it to be some time yet before the race is officially called. 
Control of the US Senate has already flipped in Republicans’ favor, however, after Democrats lost races in Ohio and West Virginia. 
Republicans also appear poised to flip the state House after Democrats lost ground in key races throughout the state, jeopardizing their already razor-thin majority. 
Republicans held onto several of their own seats that Democrats had targeted, including in the 46th state House district, where incumbent Rep. Kathy Schmaltz beat challenger Daniel Mahoney.
There are still a number of House races yet to be called by the Associated Press, but the amount of votes remaining leaves virtually no path for Democrats to retain the chamber. 
If current totals hold, Michigan Republicans could secure at least a 57-53 majority by winning the following races: 
Congressional Democrats entered Election Day with a one-seat advantage over Republicans in Michigan, but that advantage appears to be over after Republicans were able to flip the state’s 7th Congressional District. 
There, Republican Tom Barrett defeated Democrat Curtis Hertel in the mid-Michigan race to replace Slotkin, per The Associated Press. 
It was one of four hotly contested Congressional races in Michigan, with others including the:
The presidency and US Senate weren’t the only thing on voters’ ballots statewide, with seats on the state Supreme Court, State Board of Education and various university boards also up for grabs.
Many of these races are still too close to call, though returns at this point show:

It’s past midnight, and Michigan is still very much in play for both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
While Trump has won North Carolina — the first of seven swing states — Michigan was effectively tied. As of 12:25 p.m., the Associated Press had Trump up 200,000 votes, but did not include Detroit, where Harris was up more than 150,000 votes with more ballots to count.
According to the national media and forecasting models, Trump is in the catbird seat, with Harris needing to hold onto Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to salvage any chance.
Here’s what we do know:
This originally appeared in Bridge's daily newsletter
A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against six people, following a complaint of voter intimidation by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The complaint accuses the defendants of “engaging in intimidating behavior including traveling to multiple polling locations and illegally recording voters inside polling locations, following a voter to her car as she exited a polling place, and threatening that violence may befall the child of a different voter should Kamala Harris win the election.”
The order from District Court Judge Terrence Berg orders the individuals to stop harassing or intimidating voters, and bans them from coming within 100 feet of the entrance of any polling station.
During a press conference Tuesday night, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson responded to a reporter’s question about reports of intimidation in Oakland County by saying her office has been working throughout the state to investigate claims of intimidation “or even intentional confusion of voters.”
“We’ll be there to help assist any partners who want to further an investigation,” she said. “But we've seen no credible reports of anyone being stopped from voting or in other ways blocked from participating in the process.”

Detroit police say they deployed an “appropriate” number of officers at polling places on Tuesday, contrary to former President Donald Trump’s insinuations that there was something nefarious about staffing in the majority Democratic city.
“A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia,” Trump posted on his social media company Truth Social around 6:30pm. “Philadelphia and Detroit! Heavy Law Enforcement is there,” he added.
In response, the Detroit police wrote on X that the force “has assigned personnel to locations throughout the City to ensure public safety for all voters during this election cycle.
“The amount of staffing deployed is appropriate for the expected turnout and consistent with the department’s plan developed in advance to meet the needs of this event,” the agency wrote. 
“There has been no recent increase in our staffing levels. We are in close communication with the City Clerk and will provide any needed assistance in ensuring election integrity.”
Likewise, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said to the extent there were law enforcement officers at the polls, “they are there only to observe and protect the people who are protecting democracy.”

Michigan is on track for record-breaking voter turnout, and unofficial election results could be available as soon as tonight, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told reporters about 10 p.m.
“I'm hopeful that we will be the first of the seven battleground states to announce our unofficial results,” Benson said. “And we'll know that more in the hours ahead, but we're on track to have results by tomorrow, if not sooner.”
Participation in this election “was through the roof,” she added, with the mood at the polls marked by peace and excitement as opposed to the chaos that broke out in 2020 at Detroit’s Huntington Place.
Already, Benson said, every ballot voted in-person and cast today has been tabulated, and there are no long lines remaining at the polls.
Back in 2020, the Associated Press wasn’t able to call President Joe Biden’s victory in Michigan until Wednesday evening, nearly 22 hours after most of the state’s polls closed.
The faster results anticipated this year are due in large part to a new law that allows states to start counting absentee ballots on Oct. 28.
But even in Warren, whose city clerk opted not to pre-process ballots, Benson said there are still only a few thousand mail-in ballots to count.
Some 3.3 million votes were cast before today. The record for overall turnout was 5.5 million in 2020.

As of 8 p.m. Eastern time, polls had closed in most of Michigan, with the exception of four counties on the Wisconsin border.
Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee are all on central time, meaning polls there will stay open an hour longer than the rest of the state.
Those still waiting in line at 8 p.m. are allowed to remain in line and cast their ballots. 
Results were beginning to trickle in shortly after 8 p.m., with Oakland County leading the state in posting results, as is typical. Here’s a primer on why election results won’t be immediate, and why some counties are faster to post results than others. 
The Associated Press reported 2% of votes counted statewide, with Harris leading Trump 62.4% to 35.8% as of 8:18 pm. Democrats traditionally are more likely to vote early, which means margins are likely will narrow as the count continues.

Polling locations in Michigan and other swing states were the subject of bomb threats that the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined were not credible.
“Election integrity is among the FBI’s highest priorities. We will continue to work closely with our state and local law enforcement partners to respond to any threats to our elections and to protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,” the agency said in a statement. 
State officials said the bomb threats did not disrupt voting. 
“No voting in Michigan was disrupted by these non-credible threats and we want to make sure that every citizen in Michigan understands that they will be safe at the polls, and we've had a really successful and safe day so far,” said Angela Benander, chief communications officer for the Department of State, during a media call.

Michigan’s steep voter turnout may break records, and its largest city is playing a role in that. Detroit’s city clerk has predicted the city may have the highest turnout in more than a decade. 
Detroit is a Democratic stronghold that President Joe Biden won with 94% of the vote in 2020, but Republican Donald Trump improved on his 2016 totals in the city and has spent considerable time courting Detroit voters in his latest campaign. 
Detroit is 77% Black, making the city one of the “do or die” cities for Vice President Kamala Harris, according to Axios. Harris prioritized the city in the last weeks of the campaign.
Many voters who cast ballots Tuesday expressed support for Harris, including Rosalind Pride on the west side of the city. The 71-year-old called reproductive rights a key issue for her, calling abortion a personal choice the government should not interfere with.
“I do not agree with everything she (Harris) stands for, but I do not believe anything (Donald) Trump stands for at all,” Pride told BridgeDetroit.
A Harris win would mark a shift in how Black and brown girls see themselves and how men communicate with women, said Lauryn Allen, another Detroit voter who works as a researcher at Henry Ford Hospital.
“A lot of people’s mindsets will change, pertaining to women and pertaining to the presidency,” she said. 
Harris is “the best person to lead at this point in time,” said Martel Peguese, 56. “She’s not holding grudges, she’s trying to bring people together, to work together. It doesn’t matter if you’re Republican or Democrat. People are people.” 
Jerilynne Jones, a 44-year-old who works at the General Motors Factory Zero plant, voted for Trump. Jones said she doesn’t care for him or Harris, but the vice president has had four years to deliver on her promises. 
“You want to lower taxes, you wanna do this, you wanna do that, but you’ve had your opportunity,” Jones said about Harris. “The only person I’ve seen results with is Trump. He may not be the popular vote, he may be controversial, but he delivers.”

Michigan’s role as a swing state in recent elections comes as voting patterns change across the state. 
For example, Kent County, once firmly Republican, is now a “tossup” today, Wood TV reports. 
The situation leaves the state expecting surprises in some areas tonight, even as the presidential candidates often targeted their respective party’s traditional strongholds. That was shown in President Donald Trump’s closing night in Grand Rapids, and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee’s Tim Walz’s Detroit party for Kamala Harris. 
But how will Saginaw County vote? Both candidates thought they had a chance in this “swing county” that went for Trump in 2016 and President Joe Biden in 2020.
In 2020, “Biden won by flipping 49 cities and townships across the state, including Republican-leaning suburbs like Livonia in Wayne County and Rockford in Kent County,” according to reporting from Bridge Michigan data reporter Mike Wilkinson. 
“That offset a surge for Trump, who carried 14 townships by more than 75% after receiving less than 70% of their support in 2016 and flipped three communities that went Democrat that year.”

Angry rhetoric, threats, news updates, uncertainty for the future — the high-pitch stress of the past few weeks will get no easier today, especially if you’re waiting in long lines to vote.
Mental health experts have told Bridge that this stress is rooted in our most basic survival instincts, but it can be toxic, too.
More than 7 in 10 adults, or 77%, reported the nation’s future as their most significant source of stress, according to a poll in August by the American Psychological Association.
The economy was the second most common, with 73% of adults having reported it as a significant source of stress. The 2024 US presidential election followed closely at 69%.
Mental health experts around Michigan and the U.S. have offered a host of tips recently.

Didn’t get a chance to grab a custom “I Voted” sticker when you voted? No worries. Secretary of State branch offices will have them available on Wednesday. 
This year, Michigan voters had nine new stickers to choose from, designed by students and residents from across the state, including the popular werewolf sticker which is being sold on eBay. 
As of 3:30 p.m.  Tuesday, 3.38 million Michiganders —  about 46.3% of eligible voters — had already voted including 2.16 million by absentee ballot.. Nearly 92% of people who requested an absentee ballot had returned it, according to the Department of State. 
In Michigan, the polls close at 8 p.m. except for in four counties in the Upper Peninsula where the polls close at 9 p.m. because they are in Central Time. Unofficial results will not be in until at least 9 p.m. because the state waits until all polling locations are closed to begin tallying the results.

The presidential race this year fractured friendships, said 76-year-old Mitchell Johnson, who said he has voted for both Republican and Democrat candidates in local elections.
The retired pipefitter was voting Tuesday in Erie Township at the state’s southeast tip. In neighborhood streets around his precinct, yard signs were heavily pro-Trump. Johnson, a retired pipefitter, shook his head. 
The  former president, he said, “is checked out,” and he referred to former President Donald Trump’s recent rant over technical difficulties at a rally in Milwaukee in which he asked the audience “Do you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage?” and made bizarre motions with the microphone.
Trump then complained that faulty technology was damaging his arms and “my damn throat, too, because these stupid people,” as the audience laughed.
“How can anyone — Democrat or Republican — think that he has any sense at all?” Johnson said.
But just north of her, in Monroe, Sarah and John Fowler, cast their trust in Trump — tired, they said, of trying to keep up with bills.
John Fowler, 24, had voted with daughter, 1-year-old Artemis, on his lap, and in the parking lot, she wore his voting sticker.
“I want to be able to go to the grocery store and not have to spend $200 a week,” stay-at-home Sarah Fowler said.
She trusts Trump to tamp down inflation.
Making matters worse is that — even as “groceries and the economy are out of control” — U.S. aid continues to flow to Ukraine, said John Fowler, who said he works both as a certified nursing assistant and at the Meijer distribution plant north of here.
“Something has to change,” he said.— Robin Erb
U.S. Capitol Police arrested a Michigan man carrying a torch and a flare gun on Tuesday at the US Capitol Visitor Center.
NBC News reports the man is 28 and from Jackson. He also smelled like fuel, police said. 
Capitol Police said on social media at about 1:35 p.m. that they had arrested the man after he was prevented entry to the building during the screening process.

Michigan should finish counting its ballots by midday Wednesday, CNN reports.
And they could come even sooner, even as the state is on a track to possibly set a voting record. 
The reason is the new law that allows states to start counting absentee ballots on Oct. 28, according to the report. 
“This year, it’s a little bit different and a lot more efficient,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told reporters Monday. 
Even as close statewide races will need to reach the final absentee ballot count, many local and county races could have unofficial vote totals much sooner.

Michigan voters without private transportation still have options for getting to the polls.
Ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft are offering discounted rides on Election Day and various organizations are offering free rides. 
Find a county-by-county breakdown of free-ride offerings here. 
Lyft is offering voters 50% off rides to the polls using code VOTE24, which is valid until 10 p.m.. The code can be used for ride-share, bike and scooter rides. 
“Lyft believes transportation access should never be a barrier for any citizen seeking to vote,” said Jerry Golden, the company’s chief policy officer. in a press statement. 
Uber is offering customers a similar discount, 50% off rides up to $10 to their polling location and 25% off UberEats orders. Voters can take advantage of the discount in the “Go Vote” tile on the app. 
Lyft has also partnered with The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to give voters discounted rides using the code NAACPVOTE24. The code is valid for 2 rides up to $20.

Carrie DeJonghe, 62, of Saline Township said the main issue driving her to vote is women’s rights. She said Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is “smart” and “compassionate” and described Democratic US Senate hopeful Elissa Slotkin as “so accomplished.” 
DeJonghe said she is concerned about what Republican former President Donald Trump would do with the Ukraine-Russia war if he was elected president again. She said as a registered nurse, she sees the high cost of medications and does not feel that Republicans have a plan to address that issue. 
Daniel Bohnett, 28, a carpenter in Milan, told Bridge he voted for Trump and GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers because they are “opposed to the same things I’m opposed to.” He said the “ideology of liberal America” has “evil” policies.
He said he believes abortion is murder and that he rejects the idea that someone decides their gender rather than it being discovered when they are born.  
At the Saline Township Hall, Kristen Boduch, 41, brought her 5-year-old daughter, Maizie, to the polls. Boduch, a local resident who works in education, told Bridge her main issues are national security and women’s rights. She declined to say who she voted for president but said she wants her daughter to grow up feeling “ safe and secure” and to have choices when it comes to her body.— Isabel Lohman 
The FBI on Tuesday arrested two Michigan men on accusations of making separate threats against former President Donald Trump and a political-action committee.
One man, Issac Sissel, 25, of Ann Arbor, was arrested in a Canton Township hotel after authorities say he made repeated threats he made online against Trump. Court documents indicate the man told agents working for the FBI’s joint terrorism task force that he felt Trump “should have been assassinated” and predicted there would be violence following today’s election.
The social media outlet Reddit had alerted authorities to threats from Sissel beginning in September, court papers indicate. The FBI’s National Threat Operations Center in West Virginia got a new threat allegedly linked to Sissel on Saturday in which the user claimed to have an assault rifle to attack conservative Christians.
Sissel was charged with one count of making a threatening communication and is being detained until a detention hearing Thursday.
Also arrested was Christopher Clay Pierce, 46, of Jackson, on allegations he made online threats against a political action committee in which he also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat.
Pierce also made online threats against a witness in the congressional hearings regarding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to court records.  He allegedly wrote on Instagram in June 2022 that “what comes next (will) make January 6th look like a Sunday stroll through the park!”
That prompted FBI agents to visit Pierce in Jackson, according to a criminal complaint. When agents interviewed him last week, he confirmed he sent the messages but “abruptly ended the conversation and aggressively closed his front door on the Agents,” the complaint read.
Pierce was charged with one count of making a threatening interstate communication, a felony with a maximum punishment of five years in prison. He was released Tuesday on bond.

Consumers Energy confirmed a gas leak at a Northville precinct, forcing the precinct to move to a nearby middle school. The leak was caused by a third-party contractor boring through a gas line, Brian Wheeler with Consumers Energy told Votebeat.
Voters at the precinct, regularly located at 303 W. Main St., are instead being redirected to nearby Hillsdale Middle School. Wheeler says polling places are a priority for Consumers, and the company is dispatching "all resources necessary" to fix the leak.

So far, 2.1 million people have voted absentee in Michigan and 1.2 million cast their ballots during early in-person voting. Those 3.3 million votes represent 46.1% of the registered voters in Michigan. 
Michigan voters had turned in 25,000 absentee ballots on Tuesday alone, along with just over 3,704 same-day registrations, according to the latest update from the Secretary of State’s Office.
That number is expected to increase  throughout the day.
Voters have until 8 p.m. to return their absentee ballots, with the exception of those in the military and overseas. who have up to six days after the election to return their ballot. The state reported about 7,300 outstanding overseas ballots.

Turnout could set a new record for the state, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Tuesday morning during a stop in Detroit.
 "Michiganders are already voting in record numbers,” Benson said. “It's a great thing for voters and for democracy."
Michigan’s highest voter turnout percentage took place in 1960, when 72.7% of registered voters cast their ballots. 
Michigan polling places remained calm and busy by mid morning, Benson added.
Benson praised county and local officials, and noted that voters are engaged and “know the rules,” Benson said.
She also noted that the 200,000–plus absentee ballots that remain unsubmitted can be turned into clerks’ offices by 8 p.m. when polls close.

If voting seems a little more fun than usual today, that could be due to a national nonpartisan effort to fill polling places with music.
“Local DJs are spinning the sound of democracy to turn Election Day into a party,” according to the national group DJs at the Polls.
The group is urging voter turnout, and recruited volunteer DJs to play upbeat and family oriented tunes. The group “expanded on evidence that having DJs play polling places measurably increases voter turnout,” it says on its website.

Voter turnout in Michigan was at 45.8% as of 9 a.m., said Angela Benander, spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office, during a media briefing.
That total indicated more than 3.3 million voters have already cast their ballots in the state.
As of Tuesday, 8,000 absentee ballots have been returned, and 829 people registered to vote under Michigan’s same-day registration regulations.
No problems have been reported from any Michigan precinct, Benander said.
In addition, Benander added, over 100 department employees are working across the state, “monitoring what’s on the ground.”
The longest lines to vote so far were at Grace Emmanuel Baptist Church in Flint, Benander said, though it’s “moving quickly.”
Several reports from the first hour of voting had from 60 to 100 voters casting ballots at a given location, she added.
Reports of a threat at a polling location in Detroit resulted in a determination from Michigan State Police that the thread was “not credible,” Benander said, referring reporters to police for details. 
“We are looking forward to a smooth, safe, and secure Election Day,” Benander said. 
She added: “We are prepared for any potential disruptions.”

More than 3.2 million people have already voted in Michigan’s 2024 presidential election, including 1.2 million residents who cast ballots in the state’s new early in-person voting period, which ended Sunday. 
That 3.2 million figure reported by the state is already more than half the number of ballots cast in Michigan’s 2020 presidential election, where a record-setting 5.6 million residents voted, resulting in a 70% turnout. 
Of the more than 7.2 million registered voters the state currently considers “active,” nearly 44% had already voted through Sunday. 
While early in-person voting is over, voters can still return absentee ballots until 8 p.m. on Election Day. At this point, however, officials with the Secretary of State have urged voters to return absentee ballots to a drop box or their local clerk’s office directly — rather than the mail — to ensure they are received and counted on time.

JD Vance and Tim Walz will each rally in Michigan on Monday, adding to a packed schedule for the final day of the presidential campaign that already includes a planned visit by Donald Trump. 
Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, is expected to speak in Flint at the FIM Capitol Theatre around 1:15 p.m.
Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, will hold an election eve rally in Detroit with musical guests the Detroit Youth Choir, Bon Jovi and The War and Treaty. He’s expected to speak around 10:30 p.m.
The Walz event is part of what Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' campaign is calling a "national livestream show" that will include footage from rallies in multiple battleground states. 
Harris is expected in Pennsylvania on Monday night for a Philadelphia rally with Lady Gaga, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Fat Joe ,Oprah Winfrey and more. 
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is expected to close out his campaign with a late-night rally in Grand Rapids. 
— Jonathan Oosting
As he did in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump is expected to close out his presidential campaign with an election-eve rally in Grand Rapids.
The event is set for Monday night at the Van Andel Arena, according to his campaign. Trump is expected to speak around 10:30 p.m.
It's become something of a ritual for Trump, who has credited his late-night, election-eve 2016 rally in Grand Rapids with helping him squeak out a narrow Michigan victory that propelled him to the White House.

He won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes that year. 
Trump also capped his 2020 campaign with a large rally in Grand Rapids, acknowledging a "superstitious" motivation to return to the city.
He was unable to replicate his win from four years prior, however, falling to Democrat Joe Biden in Michigan by about 154,000 votes. 
As he seeks a return to the White House, the Republican presidential nominee has once again focused heavily on Michigan. The election-eve rally will be at least Trump’s 19th campaign event in the state this year, according to an unofficial Bridge Michigan tally.
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is expected to make multiple stops in Michigan on Sunday, including an evening rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. 
— Jonathan Oosting and Simon Schuster
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will cap a Sunday swing through Michigan with a rally in East Lansing, her campaign announced. 
The event, set for just two days before the election, is scheduled for roughly 6:30 p.m.
While the campaign hasn't announced full details, the rally is expected to be held at Michigan State University. 
It will be Harris' latest attempt to spur turnout among young voters, who tend to back Democrats but do not always vote in large numbers. Harris rallied in Ann Arbor, near the University of Michigan, earlier this week.
Harris is also expected to reach out to Black voters earlier Sunday with stops in metro Detroit, including visits to a Detroit church, the city's Livernois business district and Pontiac.  
The visit is likely to be Harris' last trip to Michigan before Election Day. It's part of a swing state tour that is expected to conclude Monday in Pennsylvania, another key battleground.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will rally in Macomb County on Friday. He hasn't disclosed his plans for Monday, but some Republicans expect the former president to close out his campaign in Michigan, as he did with Grand Rapids rallies in 2016 and 2020.

Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is set to campaign in Michigan on Sunday, two days before the Nov. 5 election.
Her presidential campaign has not confirmed the location or time of the event and did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. But the Michigan visit was announced as part of a broader tour of all seven battleground states over the final days of the election. 
Michigan will be the second-to-last stop, followed by Pennsylvania on Monday, according to a release from the campaign.
It’s also just one of a flurry of campaign events in Michigan coming in the election’s final week, as polls show Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump effectively tied in Michigan.
Harris last rallied supporters in Ann Arbor Monday with artist Maggie Rogers in an effort to build enthusiasm among college students, a crucial voting bloc.
Trump will rally in Macomb County on Friday, and while he has not yet disclosed his plans for Monday, some Michigan Republicans expect the former president to close out his campaign in Michigan. He did so in 2016 and 2020 with rallies in Grand Rapids the night before Election Day.

Donald Trump, JD Vance and Tim Walz will each campaign in Michigan on Friday — just four days ahead of the Nov. 5 election. 
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is planning a rally in Warren, according to his campaign. He's slated to speak around 4:30 p.m. on the campus of Macomb Community College, which he also visited in September.
It will be Trump's 18th campaign stop in Michigan this year, according to an unofficial Bridge tally. 
Vance, his running mate, will hold a rally of his own in Portage at 1 p.m., according to the campaign. 
Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is expected to speak during a Detroit event at 12:45 p.m., followed by a Flint rally at 3:30 p.m. and a Traverse City rally at 7:25 p.m.
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris held a rally in Ann Arbor on Monday but has not yet announced return plans.
More weekend or early-week visits from both presidential campaigns appear likely, however, given Michigan's status as a key swing state. Early in-person voting ends statewide on Sunday, ahead of the Tuesday election.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is returning to Michigan this week, and former President Bill Clinton will campaign in the state for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. 
Vance is expected Tuesday at Center Courts in Saginaw at noon and at HES Equipment in Holland at around 3:30 p.m., according to his campaign with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
Later Tuesday, Vance will also be at Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids for a Newsmax town hall at 8 p.m., according to the conservative cable news outlet. 
Clinton will make several stops in west Michigan on Wednesday, according to the Harris campaign. 
He's slated for a Souls to the Polls breakfast in Muskegon Heights at 8:45 a.m., a Democratic canvass launch in South Haven at 12:30 p.m. and a "community conversation" in Benton Harbor at 1:45 p.m.
Vance has made frequent stops in Michigan, a key swing state in the presidential race. He’s been in the state 10 times since joining Trump on the ticket in July.
It'll be Clinton's first campaign swing for Harris in Michigan. His wife, former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, is expected in Detroit on Monday night as part of her national book tour.

More than 145,000 voters cast in-person ballots on Saturday, the first day of nine days of statewide, early voting, beating expectations and creating long lines in some communities.
At least 12 municipalities attracted 1,000 voters, said Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. The tally is almost double the 75,000 who voted early over nine full days of early voting during the August primary.
Statewide voters in 2022 passed a constitutional amendment expanding voting options. This is the first general election with in-person early voting. The amendment also expanded absentee balloting options. 
In all, voters have returned nearly 1.5 million absentee ballots, according to a state voting dashboard.
Republican former President Donald Trump has criticized the expanded options, but he and Democratic rival Kamala Harris both encouraged supporters to vote early during separate rallies in Michigan this weekend.
Eligible Michigan citizens can register to vote in person up to 8 p.m. on Election Day,  Nov. 5 with proof of residency at their city or township clerk’s office. Voters can register and cast a ballot on the same day. Learn more at Michigan.gov/Vote.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and running mate Tim Walz will visit Ann Arbor on Monday, their campaign said. 
They'll be joined by singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. 
Additional details for the event have not yet been released. 
It'll be Harris' second stop in Michigan in three days, following her planned rally on Saturday in Kalamazoo. The vice president also campaigned in Royal Oak earlier this week.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is also frequenting the swing state in the final weeks of the campaign, with planned events Friday in Traverse City and Saturday in Novi.

Republican former US Rep. Fred Upton has endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, calling GOP nominee Donald Trump “completely unfit to serve.”
“True leaders take responsibility. They tell the truth. They put their duty before personal need and ambition. True leaders treat people with respect, even when those folks disagree with them,” Upton said on a press call Thursday morning. “Trump does none of that.”
Upton represented southwest Michigan for 36 years in the House, from 1987 until 2023, with a tenure highlighted by civility and bipartisan compromise.
He said his vote for Harris is his first for a Democratic presidential candidate, though he had not endorsed Trump in either 2016 or 2020. More than 40 former Republican members of Congress have publicly refused to support the former president, and at least 25 have directly endorsed Harris.
Upton was one of 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Upton declined to seek reelection in 2022, citing redrawn congressional districts that likely would’ve forced him to face another — more Trump-aligned — GOP incumbent.
Another former Michigan member of Congress who voted to impeach Trump, Peter Meijer, lost his seat to a challenger from the right in 2022. Meijer, who mounted a brief campaign for Senate this year, said he would vote for Trump in 2024, despite Trump having campaigned to unseat him.
Harris has prioritized outreach to moderates and conservatives who dislike Trump in the election’s closing weeks, telling voters “there is a place for you in my campaign.”
To non-Democratic voters waffling on whether to support Harris, Upton said Harris would make genuine efforts to work through congressional gridlock, citing her willingness to sign bipartisan border security legislation that was scuttled at Trump’s behest earlier this year.
He was joined on the call by another former Republican congressman from Michigan, Dave Trott, who has publicly opposed Trump since 2019. 
“This is not an issue election, in my opinion,” Trott said on the call. “This is an election about character and country over party.”
A spokesperson for the Michigan Republican Party downplayed the Harris endorsements.
“Michigan families are worried about paying their bills, putting food on the table, and saving for their kids' college tuition," Victoria LaCivita said in a statement. "Any  'Republican' campaigning for another four years of unfettered illegal immigration and rising prices under Kamala Harris is neither Republican nor worth listening to."

Vice President Kamala Harris will rally in Kalamazoo alongside Michelle Obama on Saturday, the same day as early in-person voting begins statewide in Michigan.
It will be the former first lady’s first campaign event with Harris this cycle, although she also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August. 
The Kalamazoo rally is slated for the same day as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to host a noon rally in Novi. Trump running mate JD Vance has a planned stop in Waterford Township on Thursday, and Trump will also stop in Traverse City Friday evening.
Trump won Grand Traverse County, where Traverse City is located, in 2020 against President Joe Biden by just over 1,800 votes though he lost Oakland County, which holds Waterford Township, that same cycle by over 108,000 votes.
Kalamazoo County, meanwhile, has been trending away from Trump and towards Democrats. Hillary Clinton won there with 53% of the vote in 2016, a performance Biden bested with 58% of the vote in 2020.
Trump, Harris and proxies for their campaigns have blitzed Michigan with stops this week. Former President Barack Obama appeared alongside rapper Eminem on Tuesday to campaign for Harris in Detroit. 
Recent polling has shown Harris with a 0.2% lead over Trump, according to analytics website FiveThirtyEight. That’s a 0.4% decrease for Harris since last week, and well within the margin of error, meaning the race is effectively tied.
The upcoming presidential campaign visits will each come less than two weeks before the Nov. 5 election. To see if you’re registered to vote, click here.

Republican-nominated Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement on Tuesday endorsed Democratic nominee Kimberly Ann Thomas to replace an outgoing GOP colleague. 
Thomas, a University of Michigan law professor with trial and appellate experience, is running against Republican lawmaker Andrew Fink to fill an open seat being vacated by incumbent Justice David Viviano, who is stepping down from the court at the end of his current term. 
In a statement circulated by Thomas’ campaign, Clement said she worked with Thomas on the state’s bipartisan juvenile justice task force and has “every confidence that she will continue to work for collaborative and practical ways to improve our state courts.” 
“I know she and I will not agree on every issue, but her experience and background and commitment to civility and access to justice will make the Court stronger,” Clement continued in the statement. 
Michigan Supreme Court positions are technically nonpartisan, though candidates are selected at state party conventions. 
Clement was appointed to the court in November 2017 by then-Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, and was nominated by the Michigan Republican Party for a full term in the 2018 election despite concerns from some party activists. 
She’s long been considered a swing vote on the court and has frequently sided with Democratic-nominated court justices in key cases. 
Thomas and Fink are competing for the full-term opening on the bench. 
Incumbent Justice Kyra Harris Bolden, who was appointed in 2022 by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, is facing Republican nominee and Branch County judge Patrick William O’Grady for the partial term vacated by former Justice Bridget McCormack.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will return to Michigan this weekend for rallies in Traverse City and Novi, his campaign announced. 
The Traverse City event is set for 7:30 p.m. on Friday at an Avflight facility at the Cherry Capital Airport. 
The Novi rally is set for 12 p.m. Saturday at the Suburban Showplace. 
It’s not immediately clear what the former president will discuss in the upcoming Michigan rallies, but releases from his campaign cited the auto industry and inflation, among other topics. 
The back-to-back campaign rallies will mark Trump’s 16th and 17th events in Michigan, respectively. He’s heavily targeted the state in his bid to return to the White House. 
Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris was in Oakland County on Monday and is expected back in the state on Saturday for an event with former First Lady Michelle Obama. 
— Jonathan Oosting
Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is scheduled to return to Michigan Thursday, this time in Oakland County’s Waterford Township to deliver remarks on the state’s automotive industry.
His speech is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. at the Elite Jet Center at Contact, according to a campaign statement. It’s expected that Vance, a Republican US senator from Ohio, will address layoffs within Michigan’s auto industry, taking aim at in-state electric vehicle manufacturing in the process.
As part of the announcement, the campaign claimed both Vance and former President Donald Trump will “save the auto industry in Michigan and restore prosperity in the state.” 
Since the beginning of this year, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford have each announced layoffs or plans to scale back production of certain vehicle models. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, employment in the American auto manufacturing industry hit a 34-year high in July. 
In Michigan, auto manufacturing jobs were reported at their highest level since before the Great Recession in 2007, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank Of St. Louis.
Vance’s visit this week will be the ninth time he has appeared in Michigan this election cycle and second time the Trump campaign has appeared in the township. 
Vance’s visit also comes less than two weeks until Election Day on Nov. 5. To see if you’re registered to vote, click here.

Michigan should have full, unofficial election results by the end of the day after the Nov. 5 election, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Sunday.
Benson made the comment during an appearance on the CBS program “Face The Nation” on Sunday, when she answered questions about the election certification and the vote count.
“We do have more options to process ballots sooner than Election Day” since the 2020 election, Benson said. “I’m optimistic we could see results even sooner.”
While it could take nearly a day for state results, third parties including the Associated Press regularly call races long before unofficial results are available. Those are projections based on the vote counts already reported.
Benson told “Face The Nation” host Margaret Brennan she would still compel local canvassers to certify the election if former President Donald Trump wins the state.
More than 1 million absentee ballots have already been returned in Michigan, meaning that as of Monday morning more than 14% of Michigan registered voters have voted 15 days before Election Day.
Early, in-person voting launched in Detroit this past Saturday and Benson said close to 2,000 people voted on the first day, 10 times as the turnout on the first day in the August primary election.
Benson also criticized Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, after he claimed that absentee ballots are an invitation to fraud and spread a conspiracy theory about voting machines.
“It’s incumbent upon all of us to look to trusted sources of information, like your local election officials … as opposed to people who are running social media companies with particular agendas and who have a history of amplifying conspiracy theories and false information,” Benson said.
She and Musk also sparred on X on Sunday over Bridge Michigan reporting that found new state laws, including automatic voter registration when driver licenses are renewed, have led to more registered voters in the state than eligible ones.
The state currently has 8.4 million registered voters, according to the latest records obtained by Bridge Michigan, nearly 500,000 more than the number of people in the state who are old enough to vote.
While critics say the inflated rolls are not ideal, no one is suggesting they have contributed to fraud. By federal law, the state or local clerks can only remove voters from the rolls after the state notified they moved to another state, or if election mail sent to their home is returned as undeliverable and after they do not vote in two consecutive federal elections.
By 2027, an estimated 606,800 inactive voters are expected to be removed from rolls.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama will campaign alongside Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan next week, marking the first time Obama has appeared on the campaign trail for the Democratic presidential nominee. 
Obama and Harris are expected to be in the state Saturday, Oct. 26, according to the campaign, though little additional information was immediately made available. Their planned visit is scheduled for the same day as Michigan’s early, in-person voting will be available statewide.
To find out where you can vote early and in-person, click here.
Their visit also comes the same week as former President Barack Obama plans to stump for the Harris campaign in Detroit on Tuesday. When running in 2008, Obama won Michigan with just over 57% of the vote, winning the state again in 2012 by 54%.
With only a few weeks left until the Nov. 5 Presidential election, Harris has made frequent visits to Michigan and will be here this weekend. She has planned stops in Grand Rapids, Lansing and Oakland County on Friday, followed by a Saturday stop in Detroit. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz will be in Michigan on Sunday, attending a church service in Saginaw. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his campaign has also targeted the state heavily in recent weeks. The former president will also be in Michigan Friday, hosting a roundtable discussion in Oakland County before holding a rally in Detroit.
Recent polling from the analytics website FiveThirtyEight put Harris at a 0.6% lead over Trump as of Friday, well within the margin of error as to who could win the state this fall.

Nearly 800,000 Michigan residents have already voted by absentee ballot, according to new numbers from the Secretary of State. 
A voter participation dashboard released by the department shows 781,634 voters had returned absentee ballots as of Wednesday morning. The state’s new online site will be updated daily with the latest data. 
As of Tuesday — exactly three weeks out from the Nov. 5 general election — 672,585 Michigan voters had cast absentee ballots. That was down from the 977,694 ballots returned at the same point in 2020, when the state had sent applications to every registered voter while the COVID-19 pandemic raged. 
More than 2.1 million voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday, down from 2.8 million at the same point for years earlier. 
Ultimately over 5.5 million voters cast ballots — absentee or in person — in 2020, the most ever in Michigan.
At the time, former President Donald Trump routinely criticized mail-in ballots as unsafe, and Republican voters were far more likely to vote in-person.
That trend has continued this year, with the most Republican counties also having the lowest rate of applying for and returning absentee ballots.
About 22% of active registered voters in the 10 most Republican counties have requested an absentee ballot this year, and less than 7% of registered voters in those counties have returned one. 
In the 10 most Democratic counties, 34% of active registered voters have asked for a ballot, and 11% have returned them, according to a Bridge Michigan analysis of voting patterns and registration totals.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to return to Michigan on Friday for a roundtable event in Oakland County and a rally in Detroit. 
The Oakland County stop is set for 5 p.m. and will also feature US Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Michigan US Senate candidate Mike Rogers, according to Build America's Future, a nonprofit organizing the event. 
Trump is then expected to rally with supporters at Detroit's Huntington Place convention center at 7 p.m., according to his campaign. 
As a battleground state, Michigan residents can expect to see Vice President Kamela Harris, former President Donald Trump and their vice presidential picks repeatedly throughout the 2024 campaign. Bridge will track their visits, and those of their surrogates, until Election Day. Click on the circles to see who came, when and where. (Note: This map includes visits by President Joe Biden before he ended his reelection campaign)
The rally will be Trump's first visit to Detroit since disparaging the city last week, when he suggested that if Democratic rival Kamala Harris is elected, the "whole country will end up” like Detroit – "a mess."
The venue — previously named the TCF Center — is also significant. Trump supporters attempted to stop absentee-ballot counting at the Detroit convention center in 2020 to prevent Trump's loss. 
The Trump visits will be part of a busy campaign weekend in Michigan, where Harris is also expected to make multiple stops Friday and Saturday.

In addition to her Tuesday visit for a radio town hall, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will visit Detroit on Oct. 19 to promote the start of in-person early voting. 
Detroit is opening 14 early voting sites across the city where residents can cast ballots in person or drop off an absentee ballot. It will be Harris’ seventh visit to Michigan, her campaign said Saturday.
Early voting was legalized by Michigan voters in 2022, allowing citizens to cast a ballot in person. Most communities will begin offering early voting on Oct. 26 under the law, but are allowed to open early voting centers sooner.
The Michigan Department of State reported 101,847 absentee ballots were sent to Detroit voters and 35% – 36,101 total – were turned in as of Oct. 11. 
Detroit has received plenty of attention from presidential campaigns in the final weeks of the election. Former President Barack Obama is planning to visit Detroit on Oct. 22.

Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump warned the Detroit Economic Club that the “whole country will end up being like Detroit” if Kamala Harris is elected, her campaign unveiled a new ad slamming his comments.
“He should be so goddamn lucky,” narrator Courtney B. Vance, a Detroit native, says to conclude the ad, which features scenes of Detroit’s resurgence since the city filed for bankruptcy more than a decade ago.
According to a statement from Harris’ campaign, the 60-second ad will run on television during this weekend’s Detroit Tigers and Lions games. It will also appear on social media. 
Trump disparaged the city Thursday during an address to the Detroit Economic Club. The audience, which was well-populated by supporters, did not audibly react to the statement.
The ad celebrates the city’s rebound and praises the resiliency of its residents. It also features another Trump statement from the 2020 election, when he said Detroit was like “living in hell.”
Trump has been courting Detroiters for months, hoping to peel off young Black voters from Democrats in order to win Michigan, one of the most hotly-contested battleground states. In 2020, Trump carried about 5% of the vote in the city, a slight improvement over his 2016 result.

On the heels of her running mate Tim Walz’s campaign event at Macomb County Community College on Friday, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is expected back in Detroit next week to appear on a radio show and take listener calls.
She’ll join The Breakfast Club, a nationally-syndicated radio show, for a town hall-style event hosted by Charlamagne Tha God, the comedian and author announced on air Friday morning. 
“I would like some people from Detroit to join me as I sit down and have a conversation with our Vice President Kamala Harris,” he said. 
Charlamagne said his conversation with Harris will air Tuesday at 5 p.m. It wasn’t clear how much prominence callers would have in the programming, or if Harris will make other stops in Michigan. Her campaign confirmed via email that Harris would be attending the radio event, but did not offer further details.
The Breakfast Club is popular with Black millennial audiences, a crucial voting bloc for Harris that Republican rival Donald Trump has also courted. A recent poll from Quinnipiac University showed Trump has substantially improved his performance with non-white voters in battleground states since he lost in 2022. 
The radio show drew some notoriety in 2020 when now-President Joe Biden appeared as a guest and told Charlamagne, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
Harris has visited Michigan four times since Biden announced he would not seek reelection in July, including most recently a week ago in Flint.
Trump was also in Detroit on Thursday where he spoke at a gathering of the Detroit Economic Club to roll out some new economic policy proposals.
— Simon Schuster
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz will return to Michigan on Friday for a speech in Macomb County, the campaign announced. 
A press release from the campaign indicated Walz’s campaign event will be focused on the economy and manufacturing – big issues in Macomb, which is home to several auto plants.
Walz has previously visited Grand Rapids, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Presidential campaign visits are picking up tempo with absentee voting already underway in Michigan. Vance visited Detroit Tuesday, while former President Donald Trump visited Saginaw last Thursday and is scheduled to address the Detroit Economic Club this Thursday. Walz’s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, visited Flint last Friday for a rally.
In a visit to Auburn Hills last week, Vance quipped that Michiganders would see him or Trump “probably every week” until the election.

Republican Mike Rogers and Democrat Elissa Slotkin will share the stage Tuesday night for their first debate in Michigan’s high-stakes race for an open US Senate seat. 
The hour-long debate, set to begin at 7 p.m., will be hosted by WOOD TV8 in Grand Rapids. The station's political reporter, Rick Albin, will moderate. 
The Michigan race is considered one of just three true "toss ups" in the national battle for control of the Senate. 
Slotkin, of Holly, has served in the US House since 2019. Rogers served in the House from 2001 through 2014. They’re competing to replace Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who is retiring.

The top of the Republican ticket is planning two Detroit visits this week, highlighting the importance of a city where Democrats have long dominated.
Vice presidential nominee JD Vance will make an appearance at Eastern Market on Tuesday to discuss the economy, the campaign announced. And as previously reported, presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday.
Trump and Vance have been working to court voters in Michigan’s largest city, hoping to peel off some support from Democrat Kamala Harris in a state that Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. 
Trump earned just 3% of the vote in Detroit against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2016, but for years later he did slightly better in the city, winning about 5% of the vote compared to Joe Biden’s 94% — a roughly 228,000 vote advantage. Biden won the state by about 154,000 votes.
The economic club, though, hardly represents the electorate of Michigan’s largest city. There is a fee for membership, and the club is targeted at business people looking to network with colleagues and policymakers.
Trump also spoke at the Detroit Economic Club during his first presidential run, rolling out his economic proposals in August 2016. He promised to abandon or renegotiate major trade agreements — which he did as president — and to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which he failed to do. 
Now-US Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, was ejected from that event as one of a series of protesters who disrupted Trump’s remarks.
The former president has already visited Detroit 11 times this year. Vance said last week during remarks in Auburn Hills that Michiganders should expect to see him or Trump “probably every week” until Election Day.
Vice President Kamala Harris was in Flint Friday to push back against Trump’s claims on the economy and electric vehicles.

Former President Barack Obama has endorsed fellow Democrat and Michigan US Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin in a new one-minute advertisement. 
“Elissa is the kind of leader we need: tough, independent, and effective," Obama says in the ad for Slotkin, who is competing with Republican Mike Rogers to replace retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow. 
It’s among a trio of ads the former president filmed for Democratic candidates in key Senate campaigns. 
Obama will also reportedly begin a swing-state “blitz” with presidential nominee Kamala Harris, starting next week in Pennsylvania. It's not immediately clear if that will include Michigan. 
Harris will get some additional help in Michigan in coming days. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for president in 2016 and 2020, plans to campaign for her across the state this weekend. 
Sanders and UAW President Shawn Fain are expected to hold a "rally against corporate greed" Saturday in Warren, followed by a Sanders town hall in Saginaw, according to his campaign committee. 
On Sunday, Sanders and Fain are scheduled to hold town hall-style events in Grand Rapids and East Lansing.

Former US Rep. Dave Trott launched a Michigan chapter of “Republicans for Harris” on Thursday, calling former President Donald Trump “more dangerous than ever” ahead of the candidate’s planned afternoon stop in Saginaw.
Trott, who represented parts of metro Detroit for two terms before opting not to run for re-election in 2018, has said he voted for Trump in 2016 but has emerged as a vocal Trump critic in recent years. 
The former lawmaker endorsed President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid for the presidency in August. On Thursday, Trott claimed he’s “one of many Republicans” who are doing the same. 
“For Trump, this election is a choice between the White House and the jailhouse,” Trott said, later adding, “He's emotionally, intellectually, psychologically, and, of course, morally unfit to be president.”
The comments came the same day as former GOP US Rep. Liz Cheney will campaign with Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which some claim as the birthplace of the Republican Party. (Jackson, Michigan, claims the same).
Trott’s stance on Trump has been dismissed by some GOP faithful. Earlier this year, Oakland County Republican Party Chair Vance Patrick wrote on X that Trott is no longer a recognized member of the local party.
Anyone who supports Harris over Trump “is NOT a Republican,” Patrick wrote in an August post. 
Both Trump and Harris are returning to Michigan this week as polls show the pair neck and neck. Trump is holding a rally in Saginaw Thursday, and Harris plans to make a campaign stop in Flint Friday.

Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance returned to Michigan on Wednesday, and presidential nominee Donald Trump is planning yet another speech in the battleground state. 
Fresh off a Tuesday night debate with Democrat Tim Walz, Vance spoke in Auburn Hills, where he questioned federal spending meant to help the auto industry as it shifts to electric vehicles. 
"Donald Trump believes in encouraging innovation, but there's a difference between promoting innovation and sending hundreds of billions of dollars to favored industries that make their products in China," Vance said, referencing that country's hold on critical minerals needed for batteries.
"These are two very, very different things," Vance said of the spending, which has helped facilitate some pending EV battery plant projects in Michigan.
Democrats panned Vance ahead of the visit. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is "looking to the future while Donald Trump and JD Vance want to drag our country backwards," said US Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor. 
Vance was expected at the Berlin Raceway near Grand Rapids later Wednesday.
Trump, already set to speak in Saginaw County on Thursday, will return to Michigan next week to speak at the Detroit Economic Club. 
That speech is set for Oct. 10 at 1 p.m., the Detroit Economic Club announced. Only club members and accompanied guests will have access.
Trump will be joined by local businessman John Rakolta Jr., who served as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates under Trump. 
Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz debated gun regulations on Tuesday night in response to a question about the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan. 
In the first — and potentially only — televised vice presidential debate, CBS News moderator Norah O'Donnell noted that, for the first time in Oxford, parents of the shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter after failing to keep a newly purchased handgun away from their troubled teenage son. 
O'Donnell asked: "Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings?"
Neither candidate directly answered the question but discussed broader issues of gun violence and school safety. Watch the clip below:
Vance, the Republican nominee, said he did not know details of the Michigan case. He said he generally trusts law enforcement and local authorities to make such decisions. 
But he called for increased security in schools, including better locks, stronger doors and windows and more school resource officers. 
"The idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hand of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience," Vance said. 
But "that's not far enough when we know there are things that work," said Walz, the Democratic nominee, who as governor of Minnesota last year signed "red flag" gun confiscation and universal background check measures into law.  
Walz previously opposed a federal assault weapons ban but now supports one. He said he changed his mind after hearing from the parents of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012. 
"Just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent," Walz said. "Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns, and there are things that you can do about it."

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz met on a debate stage in New York on Tuesday night for their first — and possibly only — debate before the Nov. 5 general election. 
The debate will be moderated by Norah O'Donnell of “CBS Evening News” and Margaret Brennan of “Face the Nation.” There was not a live audience.
The vice presidential hopefuls have both been in Michigan recently.
Vance, the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, spoke in Traverse City last week and is due back in Michigan on Wednesday for events in Auburn Hills and Marne. 
Walz, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, was in Michigan for at least part of last weekend. He was reportedly preparing for the debate with US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who lives near Traverse City. He also visited a Harbor Springs farm and attended the Michigan-Minnesota college football game in Ann Arbor. 
CBS News hosted the debate. Watch it here:
