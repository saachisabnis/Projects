She can get in if the movie overperforms during oscar nominations morning, but itâ€™s important for conclave to do well at the box office considering itâ€™s budget
Theyâ€™re keeping the budget under wraps.
Just how much outside of salaries did they spend?
Silk gowns, hats and red shoes could be borrowed. Lol.

 Why? Whatâ€™s its budget? 
Idk but the fact that they havenâ€™t revealed the amount yet, is suspicious
Are they now premiering Emilia Perez every Friday? I swear theyâ€™ve been to 200 festivals since May. Release the damn thing on Netflix so we can have some peace 
Iâ€™ve follow a few Selena accounts and thereâ€™s been so many private screenings too ðŸ˜­ Netflix is snatching up as many moms as they can
Why? Whatâ€™s its budget?
Well, theyâ€™re not saying. This doesnâ€™t happen all that often so when theyâ€™re secretive, somethingâ€™s up.
Outside of salaries, Iâ€™m thinking there are other, compelling reasonsâ€¦..

imagine if it was 50 million dollars
conclave is not pulling that
Cast of Emilia Perez during a gala screening of the film organized by Yves Saint Laurent and Netflix in London tonight
FYC: Emilia PÃ©rez and I'm still here in all categories.
Thoughts on Margaret Qualley getting in here for The Substance?
Deadwyler getting big raves out of LFF tonight.
FYC
Sarah Snook - The Picture of Dorian Gray

Why are you so pressed? The ladies are coming for the nominations.
Breathe.
Thoughts on Margaret Qualley getting in here for The Substance? 
Honestly, if Demi is getting the nom I believe Qualley is in. Iâ€™m very curious to see how critics are going to do with this film, it has a lot of weak contenders with mid and mixed reviews, The Substance could have a good support in these awards getting nominations for Coralie, Demi and Margaret.
Here is another point: Karla, Zoe, Selena and Adriana are going to every single film festival premiere. They are showing they will be campaigning their butts off together and Netflix is throwing money at the film. 
At this point unless they dramatically underperform this awards season or another ensemble full ramps up their campaigning I see them easily taking sag ensemble
Emilia Perez cast are working so hard to get that Oscars. Anne Hathway vibe
at this point saoirse is gonna get the best supporting actress nom easily the piano lesson and nickel boys have so far had muted audience reactions. Some critics are really pushing deadwyler but i doubt the movies are going to do much.Nickel boys sounds too indie and avant-garde and Blitz seems accessible to a large variety of voters and lots of people mentionned Ronanâ€™s great singing too. I think she is miscast but worse people have even won like zellwegger for cold mountain. The field is so weak even Jlo could get in if her movie becomes a huge hit with audiences in december. zoe and jones are the only locks. 
I agree that Deadwyler is definitely not a lock but she can still get in even if sheâ€™s the only nomination for her movie (Danielle Brooks being the obvious recent example).
