Snoop Dogg shows it pays to be a Jack of all Trades, snagging a jaw-dropping paycheck as a 2024 Paris Olympics correspondent.
On Sunday (August 4), New York venture capitalist Henry L. McNamara, who’s living it up in Paris, took to X where he spilled the tea on some juicy gossip he overheard from an NBC exec.
According to McNamara, he “Sat next to an NBC exec at dinner”, who shared that “Snoop gets paid $500k a day plus expenses to be here promoting Olympics.”
He added: “From Gin and Juice to a few million to be a celebrity at the Olympics – what a world.”

Needless to say, the West Coast rap icon has been putting in work, entertaining both athletes and spectators alike. On Friday (July 26), the highly anticipated Paris 2024 Olympics kicked off, featuring top athletes from around the world competing in a range of summer sports. At the helm of the excitement was the iconic rapper.
“Did somethin today,” wrote Snoop alongside a snapshot of himself in a red, white, and blue Ralph Lauren uniform, holding the torch in the pouring rain. “Raindrops falling on my head, but we still playing to win, baby.”
In a separate Instagram post, Tha Doggfather can be seen showcasing his dance moves. The ultimate host was even spotted busting a move with Hoda Kotb, grooving to Lady Gaga’s smash hit.
“Dancin everyday in Paris!! Tonite was fun 🤷🏿‍♂️ 😁💯👊🏿 Opening Ceremony vibes 💪🏿 #FollowTheDogg,” he wrote in the caption.
Recently, Snoop has been spotted on the sidelines cheering for Simone Biles, catching up with his longtime buddy Martha Stewart, and even picking up some fencing skills.
In an interview with AP News earlier this week, the multi-hyphenate expressed his gratitude toward the U.S. and France for the opportunity.
“I look at this as a prestigious honor and something I truly respect. I would have never dreamed of nothing like this,” he said. “I’m going to be on my best behavior. I’m going to be on my best athleticism. I’ll be able to breathe slow to walk fast and hold the torch with a smile on my face, because I realize how prestigious this event is.”
Snoop Dogg is in Paris to help cover the Games for NBC, as part of the network’s strategy to boost ratings by blending pop culture with its coverage.
