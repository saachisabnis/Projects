World-famous director Steven Spielberg is reportedly throwing his support behind President Joe Biden by actively strategizing for his reelection campaign.
Spielberg’s latest project has nothing to do with movies, and everything to do with politics, as the entertainment mogul enters the political realm in his very own way. The acclaimed director has been a staunch Biden supporter for some time, but now he’s making bold moves to help push Biden closer to the finish line in the 2024 Presidential Campaign. Spielberg is offering strategic input for the Democratic National Convention, currently scheduled for August, according to Puck.

Spielberg is working alongside his friend and former DreamWorks business partner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who is chair of the Biden campaign. Spielberg has reportedly peeled himself away from the film industry long enough to attend multiple political strategy sessions, to offer his insights on how to best spotlight Biden’s second-term vision at the upcoming convention, according to Puck.
It was also reported that Spielberg played a hand in Biden’s 2020 convention, which was hosted virtually.
Sources reported that as Biden prepares for a re-match against former President Donald Trump, Spielberg has been a participant in preliminary discussions with event organizers, but further details surrounding his input and advice were not made public, according to Puck.

He attended a fundraising event for Biden in Los Angeles in Dec., which was also attended by A-listers such as Barbra Streisand and Rob Reiner.
Biden has flexed his ability to mobilize support from influential figures such as George Clooney, Lady Gaga, Seth MacFarlane, and Bill and Hillary Clinton, according to Newsweek. (RELATED: Steven Spielberg Explains The Strange Reason Mel Gibson Was Denied A Role In ‘Schindler’s List’)
Spielberg famously created a film for former President Barack Obama in 2008, but those close to the matter do not believe he is creating a film for Biden at this time.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
