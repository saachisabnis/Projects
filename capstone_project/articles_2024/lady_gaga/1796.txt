Woman Hilariously Rips Sunglasses Off Her Boyfriend While Heâ€™s Proposing (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)
A video is making the rounds online showing a woman ripping her boyfriend's sunglasses off while he's proposing. She was fast!
She ripped those sunglasses off with some serious speed and intensity. What's the deal? Some people online thought she did it because it was rude to propose with sunglasses on. Others guessed it was because she wanted to see his eyes while he proposed. However, she says she ripped his sunglasses off because she could see his reflection in his sunglasses and didn't want to see herself ugly crying. Check out the viral video shared by @angelxo.25 below.
What do you think? Do you think she really didn't want to see herself ugly crying or do you think there's more to the story? The TikTok video is captioned, "ALL I COULD SEE WAS MY REFLECTION DON'T BLAME ME." I'm not sure if that was her original caption or if she had to change it after commenters started speculating or something like that.
As always, the comment section on TikTok is hilarious. You can always rely on that for some laughs. The comments are often funnier than the funny videos! It's my favorite part of the app. One commenter said, "Sunglasses now, Xbox controller later." That's true. You can see it coming in their future and she's going to have some serious strength throwing that Xbox controller if it's anything like the way she took his sunglasses off. Other people aren't seeing it as comical pointing out that her actions might be a red flag. Others want to see the full longer version of the video. I just can't get over how many people are seeing this as a warning and telling him to run. It seems to be a majority of the comments. Do they have a point? I guess I would be a bit alarmed if she ripped my sunglasses off while proposing, but I also can see why it probably isn't the best idea for many reasons. I feel like it might be a casual move and that's a moment you want to be as formal as possible. That's something I might struggle with when it's time to propose because I love being casual (I'm comfy in sweatpants and a hoodie as I type this). 
What do you think? Was she just trying to not see herself ugly crying? Does he have to own some of the blame for choosing to wear sunglasses while proposing? Is that not a good idea?
