Every year, the MTV VMAs produce outrageous red carpet moments. Remember Lil’ Kim’s purple nipple pasty or Lady Gaga’s meat dress? When it comes to VMAs style, maximalism always prevails. And at last night’s ceremony in New York, one notable guest adhered to such signature codes. A mystery star showed up in a pink and white leather moto-suit, complete with a giant biker helmet with cone-like ears. The question was: Who? (And no, it was not a member of Daft Punk.)
Revealing his face on the red carpet by lifting up the helmet visor, the masked celebrity turned out to be none other than rapper Lil Nas X, who is serving as a presenter this evening. It’s only natural that Lil Nas X would make such a fashion statement – he loves a fashion antic, after all. Back in 2022, Lil Nas X hit the VMAs in a theatrical Harris Reed feathered gown and headpiece, and a bejewelled suit and a ruffled blouse in 2019.
Turns out, it’s also not the first time Lil Nas X has worn the (presumably custom) design, which features “Dreamboy” along the chest. The star recently wore a silver version of the exact same look – right down to the helmet – back in August. Is Dreamboy the title of his next single? Or album? Is it his alter ego or new nickname? Time will reveal the meaning soon, but for now, he delivered one of the most head-turning looks of the VMAs.
