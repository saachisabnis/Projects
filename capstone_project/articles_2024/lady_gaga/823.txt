The Joker got the last laugh.
“Joker: Folie á Deux” creeped its way to No. 1 on its first day in theaters Friday, earning $20 million, according to The Numbers.
The Todd-Phillips-directed psychological thriller, which The Post called “a pointless sequel,” is a follow-up to 2019’s “Joker,” which earned Joaquin Phoenix, who reprises his titular role, an Oscar. 
It is also a musical — and The Post said Phoenix and his co-star Lady Gaga, who plays his love interest, Harley Quinn, “sing for no reason.”
The supervillain flick, which cost $200 million to make, is projected to take in at most $47 million on its opening weekend in 4,102 theaters, according to Deadline.
That figure is around half of what the original film made on its opening weekend. 
On its second Friday in theaters, “The Wild Robot” came in second, with sales of close to $5 million.
The sci-fi adventure, which is based on the popular children’s book series of the same name, already earned more than $50 million domestically, as per Variety.
“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” moved down a notch to third this week, its fifth in theaters, with $2.7 million in revenue. 
“Transformers One” remained in the fourth spot, with a $1.37 million-dollar take.
The psychological horror flick “Speak No Evil,” which debuted on Sept. 13, landed in fifth, earning $840,000.
