FCTRY LAb is celebrating its first women’s shoe and its inaugural retail partnership with a special launch event at Fred Segal’s Sunset Blvd. flagship in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
According to the L.A.-based footwear brand, the new Women’s MOCC is now available in-person for the first time inside Fred Segal’s West Hollywood store.
The new women’s MOCC is based off the brand’s existing men’s model of the same name. It’s a feather light slip-on shoe made of EVA foam that takes inspiration from moccasins. The style’s recycled suede-microfiber tie running through the shoe serves as a nod to the traditional threading practices of indigenous North American cultures.

For FCTRY LAb co-founder Omar Bailey, the brand’s extension into women’s shoes was a natural move. “Except for some radical Lady Gaga heels many years ago, most of the shoes I helped develop at Yeezy and at FCTRY LAb have had a unisex mindset,” Bailey told FN. “Fred Segal came to us a few months ago wanting to feature a women’s shoe concept around Coachella. Together we had a lot of fun developing our women’s MOCCs in bright spring colors with a variety of unique accessories including sparkly straps and denim gaiters.”

The new women’s MOCC can now be found on Fred Segal’s online website along with FCTRY LAb’s previous shoe releases, the Knight RNR and the men’s MOCC. Fun Coachella T-shirts, specialty gaiters and colorful sparkly straps to style the women’s MOCCs will also be provided at Wednesday’s event.
For nearly 20 years, Bailey was the architect behind shoe collections for many of the industry’s most recognized names — include the Adidas Yeezy Innovation Lab, which he led for three years ending in May 2022. Now he is front and center at the growing FCTRY LAb footwear company, which he launched in late 2022 with partner Abhishek Som.
FCTRY LAb ramped up operations In December 2022 when the company secured $6 million in financing from a diverse group of venture capital firms, top professional athletes and angel investors —including the co-founder of Tinder via Time Zero Capital, the co-founder of WeWork, the West Coast head of Warburg Pincus and a consortium of NBA and NFL stars via Chicago-based Aurelien Capital.

 









And the company has seen steady growth in the last year. Following the men’s MOCC launch in October, the footwear brand debuted two shoe collaborations with Miami Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey and rapper Symba in December. This was quickly followed up by a tie-up with NFL’s San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle Trent Williams one month later.
