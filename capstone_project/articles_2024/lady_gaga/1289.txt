Aug. 20 2024, Published 4:00 p.m. ET
Lady Gaga has become quite the bridezilla as she begins to plan her wedding to her longtime boyfriend, Michael Polansky.
An inside source told RadarOnline.com Gaga is having trouble making up her mind about what she wants her vows to look like.
The source said: "She's been going back and forth about what kind of wedding she wants.
Lady Gaga was seen supporting team USA without Michael Polanksy before the engagement news broke. 
"One day she wants an intimate low-key affair on her Malibu ranch and the next day it's a castle overseas."
All the back-and forth has left her fianc√© dizzy.
The source added: "He just wants to marry her and doesn't care about the wedding one bit. But Gaga is a perfectionist and this wedding has made her a bridezilla already."
Gaga, 38, has been sporting a diamond on that finger since April 2024, but they kept the news under wraps for months.
Lady Gaga was seen outside her Paris hotel while in town for the Olympics.
As RadarOnline.com reported, Polansky, 46, popped the question at Gaga's birthday party on March 28, but chose not to share the news with the general public. 
An insider claimed: "The couple shared the happy news with family and close friends right away, but wanted to keep the engagement private otherwise. Everyone‚Äôs excited about them getting married.
"They‚Äôre great together. He‚Äôs excited and supportive of her career. He can‚Äôt stand being in the spotlight, but lets her shine. He has his own business priorities that she‚Äôs supportive of."
Gaga herself actually let the cat out of the bag while attending the Paris Olympics.
Gaga introduced Polansky as her ‚Äòfianc√©‚Äô to the prime minister.
While watching swimming events at the Paris Aquatic Centre, she introduced the tech entrepreneur as "my fianc√©" to French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.
Attal shared the moment with fans on TikTok.
He captioned the clip: "Thank you Lady Gaga for your stunning performance at the opening ceremony. It was breathtaking. ü§©."
Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney broke off their engagement in 2016.
Lady Gaga has been engaged twice before, but has yet to make it down the aisle. 
The Poker Face singer was engaged to Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney, 43, in February 2015 but called things off in July 2016. She later got engaged to talent agent Christian Carino, but they split by February 2019.
