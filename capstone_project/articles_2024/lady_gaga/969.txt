The popcorn's been popped, the sweatpants are on, and the evening is your oyster. Your next challenge: Figuring out exactly which of the best movies available to you is the one you're going to watch tonight. No matter what you're looking for—a rom-com, a murder mystery, a sad film, a great musical movie—there are plenty of must-watch films in your chosen genre to settle in with for the first (but probably not the last) time.
We movie lovers at Marie Claire know how time-consuming picking a great movie can be, so we did the work for you. We combed through movie rankings, critical reviews, and award nominations, and spoke to fellow pop culture fans to bring you this list of crucial must-watch films. Of course, you can expect to see well-known classic dramas and romance films like Casablanca and The Sound of Music on this list, in addition to movies from iconic directors like Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Alfred Hitchcock. But modern masterpieces like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Get Out stand up just as well and are on this list, too.
The must-watch movies below are modern classics, the best of the best, the essential films that millions of people are probably jealous that you're getting to see for the first time. They span multiple countries, languages, and decades. And because pulling these movies was a hard enough task, we left this list unranked. Feel free to decide for yourself how your favorites stack up to the rest on this list, and if we've left a title off, don't yell at us too harshly. A list as subjective as this is meant to be debated, after all. Without further ado, in no particular order: The best movies of all time.
There are a few things you can (almost) always expect from a romance movie: a love story (duh!); attractive protagonists; and a happy ending—usually. Maybe you need to be reminded that true love is out there. Or maybe you need to show your partner what real romance looks like. Some of the movies on this list are funny, and some are the ultimate in sad romance films, but there’s one thing all of these romantic films have in common: They're sure to pull on your heartstrings and make you believe in love all over again.
In this swooningly romantic movie from Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke play a pair of travelers—she French, he American—who have a chance meeting in Vienna and decide to spend the evening before his departing flight walking around the city and talking to one another. In 2005, the sequel Before Sunset continues the story, and then in 2015 the trilogy is wrapped up with Before Midnight. All of them are worth watching over and over.

Less of a genre and more of a distinction, we define "classic movies" as the kind of film that changed their respective genres forever. Being familiar with the films on this list will set you apart from the casual pop culture fan and put you on the road to becoming a movie buff. For a film to be a classic in our book, it should have some years on it, be universally loved, and have a major cultural impact. The classic movies below, all released over 25 years ago, check those boxes.
This classic film is ostensibly about a dozen white men on a jury arguing over whether a young Puerto Rican man killed his father (the class and race dynamics feel unfortunately familiar, 60-plus years later).
