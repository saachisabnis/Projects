A Madame Tussauds wax figure of Beyonc√© has sparked a wave of criticism on social media, with detractors insisting the statue looks like everybody but the star.
Madame Tussauds Blackpool in the U.K. shared photos of the new wax figure on Instagram on Thursday, alongside a new sculpture of fellow singer Lady Gaga.
"Let's Dance! Our two BRAND NEW global super stars have arrived!" read a caption accompanying photos of Beyonc√© figure. "Queen Bey and Lady Gaga have landed in our Alist Awards Party and are bringing some serious red carpet vibes.
"Get down to Madame Tussauds Blackpool this Saturday and be the first to see them in the (wax) flesh!"
However, the enthusiasm displayed by the museum has been met with a notably contrasting reaction on X, formerly Twitter, where many said that the figure resembled a range of stars over Beyonc√©.
"The Beyonc√© one is REALLY BAD," said one X user in reaction to the images, while another asked: "Is Beyonc√© that difficult to make correctly?"
"When you're not sure if you've been assigned for a Rihanna, Tyra Banks, or a Beyonce figure," wrote another X user.

"Tinashe, what are you doing here!" quipped another unconvinced fan.
Referencing Beyonc√©'s stage alter ego, another reacted: "That's not even Sasha Fierce... that's Tasha Timid."
"Beyonc√© is lookin more like Carrie from King of Queens," wrote another, in reference to the sitcom character portrayed by Leah Remini.

TMZ picked up on the Remini comparisons and shared a photo of the wax figure on X, alongside the caption: "Beyonce's new wax figure is being compared to Leah Remini. Who do you think it looks like?"
Remini soon weighed in, expressing her amusement‚Äîand feeling of flattery‚Äîat the comparison to the 42-year-old singer.
"I am screaming! And loving all the tweets!" Remini, 53, wrote. "This perimenopausal woman will take any and all comparisons to the beautiful Beyonc√©!"

Beyonc√© has yet to publicly weigh in on the wax figure. Newsweek has reached out to representatives of Madame Tussauds Blackpool and Beyonc√© via email for comment.
The Break My Soul hitmaker's wax figure is not the only one that has failed to impress in recent months. Sculptures depicting singer Ariana Grande and actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson have been mocked by detractors.
A figure of Lil Wayne, which went on display at the Hollywood Wax Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, received a hilarious response from the rapper.
After the statue was compared to everybody from Steph Curry to Bob Marley, Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., wrote on X in October: "Sorry wax museum but dat s*** ain't me! You tried tho and I appreciate the effort."
