No ONE was EVER gonna beat Stone for either La La Land or Poor Things. Full stop. Now let’s focus on this year’s contenders for Actress in a Leading Role. 
Damn, in that case, then no one share their view on Davis’ trajectory that year. EVER. we’ve been warned.
Damned. Isabelle Huppert is my winner for Elle . And then, Ruth Negga for Loving. Also a great perf.
Still not sure what to make of Streep in FF Jenkins.
Portman is elegant and almost surreal. And what d’ya know Emma can sing and dance.
Another political choice.

Rooting for Demi Moore during this season.
 She did get the nomination, didn’t she? And did she get her applause because of that performance on ceremony night? yes, she did. So “Wolfali and the others” did not flop that prediction and did not cry that nomination morning. 
 She lost her frontrunner status though and narrowly escaped a snub out of pity. Even SAG avoided her. Gaga was already a best actress nominee and a winner for song. Next, please

Front runner status…? Huh?
I wouldn’t bet on Gaga winning an Oscar for acting. Not even posthumously.

I have a feeling she will win for Joker 2, I think this is her year.

Gaga? He’s talking about Kristen Stewart I think.
2024：Anora, The Substance, Dune 2, Flow, The Girl With The Needle

Nah, I don’t think that she will even be nominated. I was rooting hard for Gaga in 2022 since her performance was simply outstanding in the “Gucci” movie, but she will botch Harley Quinn. The movie will be panned by both critics and fans. Mark my words.
There is a mega-viral post on X with 25 million views full of people panning Gaga’s performance even before the movie’s release. She will be compared to Margo (who did a very good job), and her performance will feel extremely underwhelming since it will not be even close to what you would typically expect from Harley Quinn based on what we’ve seen and heard so far.
Todd Phillips says Lady Gaga’s Harley Quinn is not similar to past interpretations.
“The high voice, that accent, the gum-chewing, and all that sort of sassy stuff that’s in the comics, we stripped that away”

That role might even damage Gaga’s acting career is the backlash is too strong.
Stream MAYHEM, give Sarah Snook her Tony, Colin Farrell his Emmy and make Severance, The Studio + The Pitt sweep all awards!

Anyone expecting Gaga’s version to be like a regular Harley Quinn is stupid af. The first film did so many changes to Joker, erasing his whole villain act from the comic books, taking Batman out of the picture and making him a regular person with mental issues. Harley was obviously following that trend.

“Her performance will feel extremely underwhelming…” Jesus you’re too negative with something that no one has seen yet. I mean… Margot’s Harley is a comedic one while Gaga’s will clearly be a serious/dramatic one. I don’t see a sassy Harley fit with Joaquin’s Joker anyway lol. Don’t be a stupid comic book fan full of stereotypes.

Gaga is playing Harleen Quinzel, not Harley Quinn.

Wow, everyone needs to settle down about Gaga in “Joker 2”. Let’s actually see the film first…. I have hope she will do well and she is literally the only reason I want to see the sequel as I despised the original…. At this point, I don’t have her in my noms, but I certainly wouldn’t count her out til the film actually drops. She is an icon who keeps surprising us. We shall see…
