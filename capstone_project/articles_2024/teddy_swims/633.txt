Dancing with the Stars
October 11, 2024

As you prepare for Dancing with the Stars 33 episode 5 to arrive on ABC this coming Tuesday, the show is bringing to us another theme. This time around, though, it is more about emotional storytelling than a tribute to an iconic TV show or type of music.
(Luckily, this also means no more Gene Simmons in the ballroom after that mess a few days ago.)
For the upcoming episode, all of the remaining contestants are going to be performing dance routines that are dedicated to someone important in their lives. In some cases, it will be multiple people — in others, it will be an individual person. (Hilariously, one is dedicated to Taylor Swift — it is a smart move for votes, no?)
Without further ado, let’s get into some of the choices per Entertainment Weekly.
We are today years old learning that Dwight Howard has performed music at some point in his career — the rest of the choices, meanwhile, are a little more expected. Obviously, it makes sense for Joey to do a dance for Kelsey — however, who thought Mike Leach would be referenced on this show?
