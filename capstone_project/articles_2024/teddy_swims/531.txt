Timberland had to go big to celebrate the legacy of its infamous Original Yellow Boot. While the boot celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, the workwear imprint isn’t done spotlighting its signature footwear offering quite yet. In the new, incredibly aptly entitled “ICONIC” campaign, Timberland taps four equally as iconic creatives – Naomi Campbell, Teddy Swims, Slawn, and Kai-Isaiah Jamal – to front a captivating new shoot.
Campbell leads the lookbook and leaves little to the imagination, donning nothing but her Original Yellow Boots. Singer-songwriter Swims poses for a striking shot where his grills glow and his OG Boots are slung over his shoulder. “Through the generations, [the Original Yellow Boot] has been consistent,” says Swims. “It’s a powerful boot that represents style in such a way that never changes. It’s always fresh no matter what year it is, no matter what you put on.”
Nigerian artist Slawn expands on that sentiment, stating “The Original Yellow Boot is classic. Sexy. Very me. I’ve got like six pairs.”
Model, poet, and non-binary, trans visibility activist Jamal completes the campaign, adding “For me, ‘iconic’ are things that have legacy, history, and cultural footprints. Ultimately the story behind Timberland and the way in which culture was embraced and has birthed from it a new culture… for me, that is deeply iconic.”
Last year alone, Timberland linked up with Louis Vuitton, Wales Bonner, and White Mountaineering to rework the silhouette.
