On Tuesday (December 3), Ryan Seacrest announced the stacked music lineup that will bring 2024 to a rousing close during the annual holiday TV special, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. Country superstars Cody Johnson and Thomas Rhett, R&B sensation Tinashe, and chart-topping “Lose Control” singer Teddy Swims will all be performing during the festive event, along with the previously announced musical guest Lenny Kravitz, who will be performing at the first-ever live New Year’s Eve countdown from Las Vegas. Rita Ora will also be returning as a co-host alongside Seacrest for the live broadcast of the iconic Times Square ball drop in New York City. New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest typically receives the largest TV viewership of any non-sports rated show, and is set to air on ABC from the East and West coasts on Tuesday night, December 31.
