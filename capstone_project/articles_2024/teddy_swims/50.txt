There will be 46 shows covering all genres of music and performers at Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom from April to October, with some big names coming!
The marketing director for the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, Andy Herrick, is most excited about Pete Davidson, according to Seacoastonline. He told them,
Pete Davidson coming in is a pretty big deal.
Pete has two shows on June 22 as part of his 2024 Prehab Tour.
It doesn't matter what kind of music you like; the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom has someone you're dying to see, like Teddy Swims with his hit, "Lose Control". He's at the Casino Ballroom on August 7.
Another huge guest for the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom is Bonnie Raitt, who returns June 18. Herrick says that she loves coming to the Casino Ballroom. He told Seacoastonline that,
She has a real affinity for Hampton, has some friends in town. Last time she walked onto the stage, she ripped a slide solo like nobody’s business and then started singing like an angel.
I think I may be most excited about KC and the Sunshine Band coming back to the Casino Ballroom on August 15. You have to imagine that his hit "Get Down Tonight" was released nearly 50 years ago! When the lyrics were "Shake, shake, shake... shake your booty! Shake your booty!" Can you guess the name of that hit?
We've only scratched the surface of all the bands, genres, and performers (including the Long Island Medium 6/1 & 6/2).  The Casino Ballroom has been around for a long time, and has seen some of the greats, including Janis Joplin, The Doors, The Ramones, and U2! Andy Herrick told Seacoastonline,
This place is authentic. The players of the players have all played in this room.
