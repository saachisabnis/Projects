Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” adds a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The rapper ties his longest reign on the chart, among his three leaders, after “First Class” ruled for three weeks in April-May 2022. He has also topped the chart with “Industry Baby,” with Lil Nas X, for one week in October 2021.

	Plus, singer-songwriter Teddy Swims tallies his first Hot 100 top 10, as “Lose Control” ascends to No. 8, from No. 12.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 20, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 17 (a day later than usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday Jan. 15). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	










	Harlow’s “Lovin on Me,” released on Generation Now/Atlantic Records, drew 58 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 11%, as it wins the Hot 100’s Greatest Gainer award) and 27.9 million streams (down 4%) and sold 8,000 downloads (down 11%) in the Jan. 5-11 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The single notches a fourth week atop the Streaming Songs chart; jumps 5-2 on Radio Songs; and dips to No. 2 after two frames atop Digital Song Sales.

	“Lovin on Me” concurrently leads the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, which use the same methodology as the Hot 100, for a ninth week each.

	“Lovin on Me” is currently a standalone single from Harlow, whose most recent album, Jackman., debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 in May, becoming his third top 10 set. (The song’s hook samples singer Delbert “Dale” Greer’s 1995 track “Whatever.”)

	Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” keeps at No. 2 on the Hot 100 following four nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in October. It rules Radio Songs for a 12th week (69.4 million, down 4%), extending her personal-best command on the ranking.

	Tate McRae’s first Hot 100 top 10, “Greedy,” holds at its No. 3 best and Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, rises 5-4, after it dominated for a week upon its debut in September, as it rules the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts for a 20th week each and Hot Country Songs for a 16th week.

	










	Doja Cat’s “Paint the Town Red” descends 4-5 on the Hot 100, after it led for three nonconsecutive weeks beginning in September, and SZA’s “Snooze” stays at No. 6, after reaching No. 2, as it leads the multi-metric Hot R&B Songs chart for a 24th week.

	Tyla’s initial Hot 100 top 10, “Water,” is steady at its No. 7 high. It concurrently crowns the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for a 14th week.

	Teddy Swims achieves his first Hot 100 top 10, as “Lose Control” lifts 12-8. The song drew 24.5 million in radio audience (up 6%) Jan. 5-11, as it ranks at No. 2 on the Adult Alternative Airplay chart and in the top 20 on Adult Pop Airplay, Adult Contemporary and Pop Airplay. It also tallied 16.3 million streams (up 12%) and sold 6,000 (down 7%) in the tracking week.

	Teddy Swims (real name Jaten Dimsdale), from Conyers, Ga., first appeared on Billboard’s charts in 2021, after he broke through with a viral cover of Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You” in June 2019. (He signed to Warner Records on Christmas Eve 2019.) As a co-writer, he topped the Country Airplay chart via Thomas Rhett’s “Angels Don’t Always Have Wings” for a week last September.

	Teddy Swims scores his first Hot 100 top 10 as a writer, as well as a recording artist. He co-penned “Lose Control” with Ammo, Julian Bunetta, Infamous and Mikky Ekko, who up their top 10 totals as writers to seven, five, two and two, respectively. (Mikky Ekko first hit the top 10 as a writer and recording artist, as featured on Rihanna’s “Stay,” which rose to No. 3 in 2013.)

	“When it was finished, I was showing everybody before the song came out,” Teddy Swims told Billboard of “Lose Control” last year. “I just felt that energy, like, ‘this is lighting in a bottle.’ I knew this was going to change my life.”

	










	(You “Snooze,” you “Lose”: the words “snooze” and “lose” appear in song titles in the Hot 100’s top 10 simultaneously for the first time, thanks to SZA and Teddy Swims’ winning hits. Meanwhile, the latter is the second top 10 titled “Lose Control”; Missy Elliott’s, featuring Ciara and Fat Man Scoop, hit No. 3 in September 2005. Plus, Eric Carmen’s “Make Me Lose Control” cruised to No. 3 in August 1988.)

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills” advances 10-9 for a new high and Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” backtracks 8-10, following 16 weeks at No. 1 beginning last March, the longest reign ever for a non-collaboration.
