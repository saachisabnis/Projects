He started off doing cover songs on YouTube, now he's one of the hottest acts in music right now, and he's got a show coming up next week in Minnesota.
If you were hoping to see the 'Lose Control' singer at Grand Casino Hinkley on Saturday, September 14th, you better have already gotten your tickets, because it is sold out, and tickets are selling on the secondary market for $175 to over $600.
But, we've pulled favors, gone through some back channels, and secured one pair of tickets for the sold show, and coming up Monday morning on the MIX 108 Morning Brew, we will give you a chance to win them.
Starting at 7 AM, you'll have a chance to "Find Teddy in The Twin Ports" for the pair of tickets. Listen for clues, and call in to ask questions to help you find the Teddy Swims Teddy Bear hidden somewhere in the Twin Ports. Monday is also National Teddy Bear day, so it's a great way to celebrate!
The Teddy Swims Teddy will be hidden somewhere on public land in Duluth, Superior, Cloquet, Proctor, or Hermantown. The Teddy Swims Teddy could be in a lot of places, but it will not be hidden in or on the property of a government building, a golf course, the Lake Superior Zoo, a construction site, or any private land.
The winner must be 18+ and must provide us with full legal name, email, and phone number to receive the tickets to the sold out show.
Get ready to go bear hunting on Monday morning to win your tickets to see Teddy Swims, play "Find Teddy in The Twin Ports" Monday morning ONLY on MIX 108.
