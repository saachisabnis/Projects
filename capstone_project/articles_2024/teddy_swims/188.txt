Even before the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards kick off Wednesday, advertisers are already the big winners.
Paramount, which focused on the impact of its live offerings in its TV upfront pitch to advertisers, is putting brands in the middle of this year’s Megan Thee Stallion-hosted VMAs through integrations, influencer activations, on-the-ground executions, and more. According to the company, the show will feature eight-plus minutes of in-show branded content, the most it’s ever offered.
The in-show branded content, which is brought to life by Paramount’s Brand Studio and Paramount Advertising, will showcase longer-form custom creative and native creative in and around programming, making advertisers essential parts of the event’s cultural moments.
“There is a theme around the increasing relevance of live programming in a consumer marketplace that is really fragmented across all of these video-on-demand offerings,” John Halley, Paramount’s ad sales president, told ADWEEK.
