And just like that, Lollapalooza 2024 is coming to a close after an incredible few days where the weather miraculously held out, and fans witnessed the making of a star before their very eyes (Chappell Roan), saw an orchestra on the festival stage for the first time ever (Laufey with the Chicago Philharmonic) and even got some guest spots (Chance the Rapper with Reneé Rapp).
Not bad for the 20th edition of the event since it laid roots in Chicago in 2005.
Like Thursday’s switchup of Chappell Roan to a bigger stage, the same upgrade is happening today with super buzz act The Last Dinner Party moving over to the Tito’s Handmade Vodka Stage in a slightly later time slot, 5:45-6:45 p.m. The change has also affected the flow of the schedule on the Bacardi Stage as a result, so if you were planning to see any acts there, you may want to look at the schedule before finalizing plans today.
It’s also the last chance to get some grub at Chow Town, Lollapalooza’s foodie festival that’s just as curated as the music itself. The offerings are quite expansive this year, with a larger footprint from which to grab bites. In addition to the four main areas of Chow Town itself offering regular fare from tacos to pizza to shwarma to burgers, there’s Dessert Island with a plethora of sweet fixes including frozen pudding, Vibe Village that has creative picks like the Kong Dog, and the Plant Base area with a range of vegetarian/vegan options. But above all, water is key with temps inching up towards 90 degrees for the festival’s finale.

Chicago’s Scarlet Demore was one of the first acts to open up the festivities Sunday, continuing the swell of incredible women artists who have dominated the lineup this weekend. Today alone, Melanie Martinez headlines the Bud Light Stage while The Last Dinner Party is one of the hottest tickets, and Nico Vega’s banshee singer Aja Volkman and Japanese metalcore band Hanabie. will no doubt turn a few heads.
In Scarlet Demore, the ever-enthusiastic singer Cat Ayala is a big part of the draw of the local act (also featuring guitarists Alex Gonzalez and Joel Smith and bassist G Passaro) who have steadily been growing their following since forming in 2017. Coming off like a gothic Gwen Stefani, Ayala’s natural retro-skewed vocal style is a unique match for the instrumental assault behind her.

There are notes of ska but the act also has a heavy focus on alternative rock, a bit of punk and even some riot grrrl influence, particularly in the empowered lyrics that tie it all together.
“All I want you to do for the next 40 minutes is just have fun, I don’t care if you ever listen to me again,” said Ayala. “This time is as much yours as it’s ours.”
The crowd heeded the message. By the time Scarlet Demore tore into clear fan favorite “Wendy’s a Pisces,” a decent faction had rallied together, singing along and pumping their firsts in the air. With Chicago’s rock scene exploding the past few years, and particularly hitting a fever pitch in 2024, Scarlet Demore is on the cusp of breaking out just the same. — Selena Fragassi

Aja Volkman with Nico Vega performs on the fourth day of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024.
Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times
Maybe some people came over to see Nico Vega because they heard the actor (and local native) Michael Peña was in the band. “I am from Chicago, I am your son,” he joked during the set, extending his arms out like he was giving one big virtual hug.
Or, maybe some came over because they were curious about the Imagine Dragons connection (Nico Vega’s singer Aja Volkman was married to Dan Reynolds for a number of years).
And still maybe some had come out after following the band for years like yours truly. 
No matter the scenario, what the crowd got was a true feast of rock ‘n’ roll with one of the best frontwomen/vocalists in the game. Volkman is a tour de force, her voice a gravely, husky, raspy growl that brings to mind a modern-day Janis Joplin while her in-your-face prowling at the lip of the stage and Tina-esque sashaying kept eyes tracking her for the better part of 40 minutes. 
Though the music project began some 20 years ago, it went through a near-decade hiatus until reforming in 2023. And in many ways the past year has marked a positive new beginning. Not only does Peña, an original member, return to the fold for the first time since 2007 (when his acting career took off) but Volkman has also found her voice and presence again after taking time to raise her family.

The band — joined by drummer Dan Epand and guitarist Rich Koehler — even has a guest horn section this time around.
The Nico Vega of 2024 also appears even more amped up than in the early days. When the group barreled through new song “$5,” you could feel the fire in Volkman’s chest unfurling through her microphone as the bandmates’ aggression egged her on. 
“Has anyone ever made you feel worthless? Guess what baby, you are priceless and there’s no replacing you,” Volkman professed in the middle of the performance.
And when they pulled out 2013 banger “Beast” from the vault, the message — about giving the working man more respect — spared no prisoners, taking on new meaning as economic disparity only grows. 
Hopefully this new iteration of Nico Vega is the total resurrection needed to propel the band to the big leagues. Judging by the number of fans Wikipedia’ing the band as they watched, hungry to learn more, it’s a very good sign. — Selena Fragassi

Teezo Touchdown performs on the fourth day of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024.
Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Time
Chance the Rapper might as well be anointed mayor of Lollapalooza with all the surprise appearances he makes at the event year after year.
After Friday’s drop-in on Renee Rapp, his latest came Sunday during Teezo Touchdown’s set; Chance didn’t perform but he did have a few words to say about the eclectic singer-songwriter-emcee. 
“I gotta say, I almost cried. Teezo is one of the most inspirational artists I know,” Chance shared, referencing TT’s “100 Drums” track and video that caught him by surprise in 2019. “You guys should be happy you’re here. Teezo Touchdown is an artist to say. If you’re here you believe in Teezo and you believe in yourself. Chicago I’m proud of y’all.”
It was the second time in a few years that the Beaumont, Texas, native has played the festival, the other time in 2022. “A lot has changed since then,” the 31-year-old shared, running through career milestones including his first sold-out headlining tour, guesting on several songs for the likes of Tyler, The Creator, Drake and Travis Scott and releasing his own debut, “How Do You Sleep At Night?,” in 2023.

“I’d like to show you everything I learned since 2022,” Teezo added, running through key tracks like “OK” and “Third Coast” with a pared-down affair and offering a more subdued look than usual. Gone were the spikes, nails and jewelry in his face and hair, swapped for a simple wig cap, athleisurewear and neon gloves. The most over-the-top accessory was his microphone wrapped within a bouquet of flowers. 
The switchup worked, though, and put more focus on his artistry, which is a great example of crossover potential. On any given track you can hear notes of R&B, hip-hop, punk, emo, ‘80s pop and a handful of other influences, a combination the artist has called “rock & boom.”
Even without Chance’s endorsement, Teezo Touchdown always scores big with Chicago crowds who showed up to support him again Sunday. “This is not only a beautiful place and city but it has beautiful people,” he said. “Thank you for all the love you have shown me since day one.” —Selena Fragassi

Carmen DeLeon, a 23-year-old Venezuela native, started her set by acknowledging the political turmoil in her home country. Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner of a presidential election just a week ago, making it unsafe for migrants to return to the country as long as he’s in power.
She began the performance with her two Spanish-language hit songs, “Mala Memoria” and “Mariposas,” before warming up the crowd with a catchy chorus in “Wonderful.”
Despite everything going on back home, she stressed that while she and her fellow Venezuelans “wanna raise our voices” for justice, she was here to have an incredible time. DeLeon tied a Venezuelan flag around the base of her microphone and got ready to dive in.
The BMI Stage, located underneath a shady canopy of trees, is special to DeLeon. 16 years ago, Lady Gaga & The Starlight Revue performed a mid-afternoon debut set in the same place.
So as a tribute to the superstar, DeLeon performed an emotional cover of Lady Gaga’s “Always Remember Us This Way” from the “A Star is Born” movie soundtrack that left her teary-eyed.
“You guys are the ones that make my dreams come true,” she said, filled with gratitude, to the audience. “I’m gonna clap for you guys!”

Much of her music has a tropical flow inspired by reggaeton and Latin trap beats, but when leaning into rocker vibes, she sounds great backed up by a band.
She complimented — and then apologized — to a fan for “having beautiful eyes.”
“I just can’t stop staring at them,” she said.
DeLeon said she’s got “no filter” and likes to tell it like it is. She frequently interacted with fans throughout the set, telling one of them not to smoke because it’s unhealthy for them. Another fan gifted her a scarf, which DeLeon put on right away.
This all led to her song “El Vecino,” which she said was written about a gorgeous neighbor who rejected her. (To be fair, it was her pitbull’s fault for scaring off his tiny schnauzer.)
The show ended with encore of “Wonderful,” where she allowed the fans to finish the chorus as she exited. — Ambar Colón

By the time The Last Dinner Party was getting ready to grace the Tito’s Stage, a huge flock of people had gathered, many cooling themselves with giant handheld paper fans.
The scene was almost too perfect — the London buzz band is lovingly theatrical, typically costumed (often in peasant wear and corsets) and makes baroque-leaning modern rock that can bring to mind the Victorian era and, naturally, accordion fans and fainting couches.
But more than props this Sunday, these hand fans were practical as the sun continued to beat down, particularly on the asphalt surface near the stage. “We have a little housekeeping to do,” singer Abigail Morris began. “We’ve been playing a lot of fests this summer. If anyone needs water or is faint or has a problem just signal to us and we’ll stop. Keep drinking water, please.”
Sure enough, near the end of the set, there was a medical emergency in which the quintet stopped the set until the person was rescued, eliciting Morris to give credit to the festival crews that have been working overtime this weekend: “Let’s give a big round of applause for the security and medical teams.” 
The moment was a brief pause in an otherwise flawless, seamless set, one that offered staple tracks like “Nothing Matters,” a taste of an unreleased song called “Second Best” as well as a cover of Blondie’s “Call Me.” The hourlong stunner shows why the act is such a hot commodity as of late, selling out club dates and booking a slew of key festival appearances.

There’s something so refreshingly different about the art rock crafted by the group, which also features lead guitarist and mandolinist Emily Roberts, rhythm guitarist Lizzie Mayland, bassist Georgia Davies and keyboardist Aurora Nishevci (plus Casper Miles as the touring drummer). 
They not only have epic riffs, beautiful harmonized vocals that bring a choir of angels or a sea of sirens to mind and a diverse array of stylistic influences from Kate Bush to Blondie to even ABBA, but there’s this effortless dramatic spin to it all. Almost like they could be leading roles in Bronte novels or Shakespeare plays, of course exaggerated by the lyrical poetry they create. 
“I’m just a mirror, I don’t exist without your gaze” (from the song “Mirror”) is so powerful it will likely be a trending script tattoo in no time.
The only pity of the set taking place at the Tito’s Stage (a last-minute maneuver to accommodate the large crowds that were expected) is that it doesn’t have the best sound and there are no video screens to see artists in full detail. So for anyone in the back or who didn’t get to go at all, when The Last Dinner Party does come back to Chicago, you’ll want to get tickets and see the band in full glory. —Selena Fragassi

SiR performs on the fourth day of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024.
Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times
Sir Darryl Farris, known by his moniker SiR, added a soulful and lyrical set to the last day of Lollapalooza 2024.
SiR used a shirt already drenched in sweat to wipe his forehead after his opening song “John Redcorn,” inspired by the “King of the Hill” character of the same name.
“It’s hot as f--- up here,” he said, noting he’s never performed under this type of heat. And while he soaked in the sun shining directly on stage, he let the weight of the moment wash over him, too.
SiR’s first-ever performance at Lollapalooza comes five years after his last show in Chicago at Concord Music Hall. For the last several years he’d been dealing with personal issues that prevented him from returning, he explained.
Getting emotional after performing “Hair Down” and “D’Evils,” SiR opened up about his sobriety journey.
“I am a year and ten months sober as of last week. I wouldn’t wanna be here and not give you the best version of myself,” SiR said.
“I’m blessed. People don’t make it out of what I made it out of, man,” he shared as tears rolled down his cheeks. “My sobriety belongs to you guys, too.”
The California-born rapper and singer-songwriter brought out a couple of special guests, including his good friend and fellow singer Zacari to perform “Mood.”
His blood brother Davion Farris joined him for a duet on “The Recipe,” too. The guest’s microphones didn’t seem to work as well as SiR’s, so the moments he let them go solo were muffled.

While SiR has plenty of hits, much of his older music has the same serene sound —with influences of rhythm and blues, slow drums and gospel runs— and it was evident on stage as some moments caused the mood to lull out.
So when he played tracks off of his 2023 album “HEAVY,” SiR proved that he could get a little groovier.
With vocals that teetered on country or Southern twang to start “SIX WHOLE DAYS,” SiR’s live rendition of the song was an easygoing, feel-good performance.
This recent music gives fans insight into his struggles and explains the hiatus he took to take care of himself. Some might call his new music diluted, but for others, it’s a testament to his growth and greenness, and departure from the man he used to be.
“I can’t wait to come back to Chicago,” he said in his last words on stage. —Ambar Colón

“In the spirit of having a great time today, I’m invoking an Atlanta rule: Stay with it!” said Georgia-born singer-songwriter Teddy Swims on stage Sunday afternoon during what’s been one of the warmer Lollapalooza weekends in recent memory. “Let’s stay hydrated and check on your friends. Safety is first.”
With platforms like TikTok and YouTube enabling artists to quickly develop a following, Lollapalooza has been forced to adjust its schedule this year to accommodate artists like Chappell Roan, The Last Dinner Party and Swims, each of whom was moved to a larger station in anticipation of significant audiences.
Swims attracted a massive early crowd Sunday at 4:45 p.m., performing in Grant Park’s Hutchinson Field on the T-Mobile south main stage.
Bounding onto the stage in a Chicago Bulls jersey, Swims wasted no time exposing the crowd to his powerhouse lead vocal over the course of an hourlong set that saw him backed by red-hot backing band Freak Freely.
While guitar cut through opener “Goodbye’s Been Good to You,” nothing could overpower Swims’ pristine vocal, especially impressive on such a hot, humid day.

Swims offered up one of the weekend’s most rewarding performances, pausing despite the festival expanse to share poignant, introspective stories. He bucked the festival trend by offering up a unique performance instead of regurgitating the exact same festival setlist, performing one song, “Bad Dreams,” live for the first time.
“Alright, I’m gonna get serious if I can. We usually don’t play this at a festival,” said Swims, setting up “Some Things I’ll Never Know.” “I find the older I get, you don’t get closure when people leave your life. You may never get it. The only thing you can do is accept things you can’t control. So, if you’re willing to take a blessing, this song means a lot to me.”
In a rare festival moment, Sunday’s packed Lollapalooza crowd actually quieted down, embracing both the message and the performance as Swims addressed the audience over a gorgeous piano backing.
Simmering throughout, Sunday’s performance boiled over as Swims and company launched into megahit “Lose Control,” with a gorgeous, extended jazz-driven piano intro giving way to the only element capable of overpowering Swims’ incredible voice: a big crowd singing a huge hit.
“Thank you so much, Lolla for making us feel at home! This is the best band on the planet,” Swims said, leaving the stage as the band played him off in a manner akin to the legendary James Brown. —Jim Ryan
