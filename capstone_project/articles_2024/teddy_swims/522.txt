Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” rebounds a spot for a 16th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, matching the longest reign of the 2020s. The song, which became the singer-songwriter’s first leader in July, matches the domination of Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” – like “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a country-pop crossover smash – in 2023.

	Over the Hot 100’s entire 66-year history, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is now tied for the second-longest command, among just five hits to have led for at least 16 weeks. Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, ruled for a record 19 weeks in 2019.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” additionally extends the longest No. 1 run this year – 20 weeks – on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. It’s one of only nine titles to reach the milestone since the survey became the genre’s all-encompassing songs chart in 1958.

	Elsewhere in the Hot 100’s top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” rises 4-2 for a new high, aided by three new versions and sale-pricing during the tracking week.

	Plus, Tyler, the Creator notches his first two Hot 100 top 10s: “St. Chroma,” featuring Daniel Caesar – the week’s most-streamed song – debuts at No. 7 and “Noid” soars 43-10. Both are from his new album, Chromakopia, which launches at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Nov. 9, 2024) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Nov. 5). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy),” on American Dogwood/EMPIRE (with country radio promotion by Magnolia Music), totaled 72.6 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1% week-over-week), 22.1 million official streams (down 8%) and 5,000 sold (down 19%) in the United States Oct. 25-31.

	The track holds for a 14th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs and drops 3-7 after 14 weeks atop Digital Song Sales and 3-8 following nine weeks atop Streaming Songs.

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” equals the 16-week Hot 100 reign of Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” in 2023 for the longest of the 2020s. (The former breaks out of a tie with Harry Styles’ 15-week leader “As It Was” in 2022.)

	“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is now one of only five No. 1s in the Hot 100’s entire history to amass 16 or more weeks on top – of 1,175 total leaders dating to the chart’s Aug. 4, 1958, start. (All five have led since the chart adopted electronically monitored Luminate data in November 1991, at which point longer reigns than before subsequently became more common.)

	Here’s a recap of the five longest-leading Hot 100 No. 1s over the chart’s history:

	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” pushes 4-2 for a new Hot 100 high (outpacing its prior No. 3 peak reached upon its debut in late August), aided by three new versions, which, like the original mix, were discounted to 69 cents in the iTunes Store during the tracking week. “Live in Las Vegas” and instrumental versions were released Oct. 29, followed by an acoustic version Oct. 31.

	The song (with all versions combined for charting and data tracking purposes) drew 45.3 million in radio reach (up 9%) and 22.6 million streams (up nearly 1%) and sold 16,000 (up 329%) Oct. 25-31. It rebounds for a second week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, while rising 11-9 on Radio Songs, where it becomes Mars’ 19th top 10 and Gaga’s 12th. The ballad marks her first Radio Songs top 10 this decade and her highest rank since “Applause” reached No. 7 in 2013.

	Tyler, the Creator claims his first two Hot 100 top 10s: “St. Chroma,” featuring Daniel Caesar, debuts at No. 7 and “Noid” surges 43-10. The songs reach the region almost entirely from streaming, with 24.3 million and 23.2 million streams, respectively. Notably, the former was released Oct. 28 and logs its sum from just four days during the tracking week; the latter drew 10.6 million streams in the prior tracking week, also over four days, following its Oct. 21 release. “St. Chroma” concurrently debuts as Tyler, the Creator’s first No. 1 on Streaming Songs.

	Prior to this week, Tyler, the Creator charted 33 Hot 100 titles, hitting a No. 13 high with “Earfquake” in 2019. His new entries are from his album Chromakopia, which premieres at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, where it’s his third leader.

	Caesar scores his second Hot 100 top 10 and Streaming Songs No. 1: Justin Bieber’s “Peaches,” on which he and Giveon are featured, led each list for a week in April 2021.

	Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 2. It tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a 13th week each.

	Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” rises 5-4 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 3, while her “Taste” is steady at No. 9, after it debuted at its No. 2 high.

	Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, ascends 6-5 on the Hot 100, following six weeks at No. 1 beginning upon its debut in May.

	Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March, lifts 7-6 – and solely claims the third-most weeks spent in the top 10 all-time:

	Also in the Hot 100’s top 10, Wallen’s “Love Somebody” falls to No. 8, a week after it debuted as his third No. 1.
