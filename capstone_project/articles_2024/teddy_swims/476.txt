do we have a thread with all of the projects/artists eligible for 2025? if not, i can make one to keep track of everything and everyone who is eligible 
sounds like youre fucking disgraceful because i made this account 2 years ago and never predicted anything, just rarely commented under this rusty ass thread to see what people’s opinions were like! 😊swiftie didnt deserve the award
u dont know shit about me yet thinks i care abt the grammys 😭😭im crying youre such a loser and worst youre probably racist/or weird
I don’t think we have a thread specifically for that, we are just commenting here if there’s news about new releases. It would be cool to have everything in one place, we usually end up talking about only the same people and the rest gets a bit forgotten.

true but we can have a thread with all eligible work as a reference. i can make one in just a minute. I have my own list with all the works that were referenced in the past 2 threads
Agora Hills – ROTY, Melodic Rap, Best Music Video Scarlet- Rap Album and AOTY 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 
I’m hoping she pushes “Skull and Bones” as a single. It would be her best chance yet to win a Rap Grammy unless she faces juggernauts. “Agora Hills” seems likely to be submitted to pop.
That Jay Z speech was ridiculous. There were better ways to word (a very rightful concern) that Beyoncé has never won AOTY but who is he to say “some of yall don’t even belong in this catgeory??” 
Just why? 
I’m not sure we see Chris Stapleton in AOTY again. Despite this past year being a landmark one for country in terms of chart performance and general popularity, country artists were snubbed across the board in the general field. Lainey Wilson being strong enough to take Country Album over Zach Bryan but still not strong enough to get into Best New Artist over people who got no other nominations says quite a bit… I expect pop, pop-friendly alternative, and R&B to dominate once again.
That being said, I do also think that Musgraves has a shot. The fact that she’s a previous winner and has more of a pop-friendly sound pushes her ahead, but honestly I have my doubt even about her, will have to track the album rollout for longer before I predict her.

 I’m hoping Go Off or 97 becomes the next single. I would say Gun but i don’t think it would be radio friendly. 
You’re right about Agora Hills probably be submitted to pop solo. I hope she wins BMV tho!
Academy Award Winner, Cillian Murphy!

I agree, I think Kacey would need to have real success to achieve this.
otherwise she will only be in country categories.

Go Off and 97 aren’t the type of songs that would give her a chance at winning a Rap Grammy unless they were big hits. Skull and Bones production wise, theme wise and rap wise is the most Rap Grammy baity song she’s ever made.
everyone, we now have a thread to collect all projects and artists eligible for the 2025 Grammy Awards. feel free to reply on the thread with any submission missing on the list. currently working on BNA. thank you 🙂 https://www.goldderby.com/forum/music/grammys-2025-eligible-projects-and-artists/#post-1205734302

If Chris couldn’t get it with Starting Over, he won’t do it with Higher unfortunately. I really don’t see Country making into AOTY without the BRP tbh The Country block clearly has their favourites but it doesn’t seem strong enough to get them in the GF, but maybe Kacey can do it since she seems to have more crossover appeal.
