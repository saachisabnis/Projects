It has now been confirmed that American pop star Katy Perry will be headlining the Sunday show alongside UK chart-toppers Becky Hill, Tom Grennan and KSI. Norwegian DJ and record producer Kygo will also join the Sunday line-up along with English DJ Joel Corry and Australian DJ Sonny Fodera.

For those whose musical tastes run elsewhere and may find Tom Grennan and Sigala's performances less appealing than Coldplay's, fret not. There's still an opportunity to catch the latter as their tour tickets remain available on multiple resale platforms.
Tickets for Coldplay's headline stadium tour went on sale last month and have mostly sold out. However, a good number of tickets are still available on various resale websites. These platforms, including Viagogo, StubHub and others, allow fans to buy and sell their tickets at their convenience, at a price they set.
Sites such as viagogo, Stubhub, and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that ticket conditions often prohibit resale after initial purchase. Those tickets may not be valid for admittance to gigs.
Fans intending to buy tickets for live events through resale websites should check the ticket terms and conditions, to confirm whether resale is prohibited, before they buy. Ticket terms and conditions can be checked with the original seller, such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation. If resale is prohibited, tickets bought second-hand could be voided and admission to the event refused.
