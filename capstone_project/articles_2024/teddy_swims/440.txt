ROCKFORD, Ill. (WTVO) — DeAndre Hembly, currently touring with “Lose Control” and “The Door” singer Teddy Swims, reunited with his Auburn CAPA instructor Beth Heuer on Friday before taking the stage with Swims at Hard Rock Live.
Hembly has been the drummer with Swims’ band since 2022, according to Rockford Public Schools. “I didn’t choose the drums. The drums chose me,” he said.
Heuer was his instructor in both jazz band and wind ensemble. The pair were reunited on Friday, before the concert.
“Even though DeAndre has played for 80,000 fans before, he says it’s a new feeling for him to be home and performing in Rockford. This will be Heuer’s first time seeing her former student put on a show with the band,” Rockford Public Schools said in a Facebook post.
Hembly graduated from Auburn High School in 2013.
Swims is a rising star in the R&B music scene, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for “Lose Control.”
Hembly will perform with Teddy Swims Friday at 7 p.m. at Hard Rock Live, inside the Hard Rock Casino Rockford, at 7801 E State Street.
