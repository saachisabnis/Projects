I did something this weekend that's on every adrenaline junkie’s bucket list—I agreed to let a motorcycle jump over me at the Nitro Circus show at the BMO Center in Rockford.
My job has its perks. I've guest-hosted Rockford IceHogs games, interviewed Teddy Swims at the Hard Rock Casino, and even had my first luxury box suite experience at the United Center for a Chicago Bulls game.
But this weekend?  I agreed to put my life on the line for pure entertainment.
If you told me I’d agree to something this insane, I wouldn't have believed you.
During the pre-show, I was brought onto the stunt area, guided onto an inflatable ramp, and faced away from the motorbike that was about to jump over me.
The instructions: drop to the ground as fast as I could when I heard the sound of the bike revving. And then—whoosh—the bike flew over me. Inches over my head!!!
Don't worry, a signed a waiver, had a stretcher on stand-by, and the Nitro Circus team took really good care of me throughout the entire process.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience with an awesome group of people.
The adrenaline rush was unreal. How many people can say they let a motorcycle fly over them?  It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment I’ll never forget. Thanks, Nitro Circus—you definitely took my love for extreme stunts to a whole new level!
Nitro Circus is an electrifying show featuring daring athletes performing mind-blowing stunts on dirt bikes, scooters, skateboards, and motorbikes. These guys are fearless!
