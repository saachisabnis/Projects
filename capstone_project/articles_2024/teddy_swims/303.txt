Country music is dominating bars across America. Four of the Top 5 songs played on digital jukeboxes are country songs, including a new No. 1.
Previously, Chris Stapleton's "Tennessee Whiskey" was the most-played song on TouchTunes. He slides to No. 2 overall, which is still amazing because the hit is almost 10 years old.

Here are the Top 5 songs on TouchTunes Frontline chart, per Billboard, followed by even more proof that country is No. 1. ("Tennessee Whiskey" is No. 2 overall but does not qualify for this list due to its age.)
Shaboozey's ascent to No. 1 is surprising because the song wasn't released until two weeks into the quarter. However, it's been a consistent No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.
Country music's domination of bars and restaurants is not new. In 2023, nine of the Top 10 most-played male artists (Morgan Wallen No. 1) on TouchTunes were country, as well as four of the Top 10 women (plus Taylor Swift, although it's not clear how her country catalog boosted her to No. 1 female).
During Q2, nine of the Top 10 most played catalog songs were country, but overall, the genre ranks second to rock. Country music is No. 1 on the Frontline chart, however, with 36 percent of plays.
"I Had Some Help" was the No. 1 song on country radio last week. "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" was No. 4, but spent its fifth week on the Hot Country Songs chart this week. The latter chart tallies airplay, digital sales and streaming.
