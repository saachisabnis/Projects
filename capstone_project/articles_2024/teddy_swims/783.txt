Machine Gun Kelly stopped by iHeartRadio's WNCI 97.9 studio in Columbus on Thursday (September 26) for an intimate performance of one of his most recent hits, and brought out a surprise guest to help him sing the track. 
The "Emo Girl" standout, born Colson Baker, invited fellow artist and friend Teddy Swims (who just happened to be in the beloved Ohio city on the day of the performance) to the stage to add his vocal excellence to "Lonely Road," released this summer with Jelly Roll. 
"Umm if you don't mind, I'd be super honored if I could bring out a very talented friend of mine who just happens to be in Columbus the same day we are." 
Swims quickly found his way to the stage and took a seat next to MGK before the two belted out the tune as their voices blended seamlessly to deliver each chorus. The duo alternated verses as Swims put his gritty, unfiltered spin on the track and Baker strummed the guitar. 
The pair delivered an unforgettable acoustic cover of the catchy single as audience members watch in awe, concluding their performance with a subtle fist bump before saying goodbye to fans present at the show.
