The CMA has awarded Billboard staff writer Jessica Nicholson with the 2024 Media Achievement Award.
Nicholson, who was formerly MusicRow‘s managing editor, was surprised with news of her win yesterday (Nov. 19.) backstage at Bridgestone Arena during CMA Awards rehearsals by Thomas Rhett, who will take the CMA Awards stage with Teddy Swims on Wednesday to perform a mash-up of both of their hits, “Somethin’ ‘Bout A Woman” and “Lose Control.”
The CMA Media Achievement Award recognizes the outstanding achievements of print and online journalists, columnists, authors, editors, television writers, producers and bookers and syndicated radio reporters in the media as they relate to country music. The award is voted on by publicist members of CMA.
Nicholson joined Billboard full time in 2021. Prior to joining Billboard, she also wrote for various publications including American Songwriter, CMT, Forbes, Country Weekly and more.
The 58th Annual CMA Awards, hosted by Luke Bryan, Peyton Manning and Lainey Wilson, airs live from Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena tonight (Nov. 20) on ABC and next day on Hulu.
