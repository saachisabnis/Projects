Riser House Publishing has extended its partnership with songwriter Michael Whitworth. The songwriter first signed with Riser House in 2016.
“Riser House is family, and they have been since day one. They truly believe in me and have allowed me to grow and develop as a writer to find my authentic voice. It’s a no brainer to continue this partnership and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Jennifer Johnson and Matt Swanson believed in me early on, and there’s been no one better to understand and guide me as a writer than Brandon [Perdue], and now Kirby [Mathews]. I’m just really grateful. I can’t wait to see what down the road looks like,” shares Whitworth.
Since his signing, he has had over 100 cuts in country, rock and pop from Teddy Swims, Nate Smith, Mitchell Tenpenny, Alana Springsteen, Florida Georgia Line, Charlotte Sands and more. He co-penned Jelly Roll‘s No. 1 hit at rock radio “Dead Man Walking.” Last year, Whitworth notched 40 cuts in total.
“Michael Whitworth is someone I know I can put in any room and trust he’ll more than hold his own,” says Brandon Perdue, SVP of A&R + Publishing, Riser House. “Whether it’s a session with an A-list artist, a brand new signing, or a room full of fellow hit writers, I always know Michael is going to bring the heat. He isn’t interested in chasing trends others are setting, rather he is bringing fresh and challenging concepts and melodies to every session. Michael is truly one of the most talented creatives in this town and Riser House is so thankful to continue being Team Whitworth.”
