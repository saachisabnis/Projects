One of today's most popular artists, Teddy Swims, announced his "I've Tried Everything But Therapy Tour," and one of the stops on the tour is at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado.
Hailing from Conyers, Georgia, Jaten Dimsdale, better known to his millions of fans as Teddy Swims, broke into the music scene on a larger scale in 2019 and hasn't looked back.
Swims, which is an acronym for "Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes," just played a show in Dillon, Colorado last month. The show as fantastic and Teddy's Colorado fanbase demanded more, so he's giving them just that.
Titled after his first full LP, Teddy Swim's "I've Tried Everything But Therapy Tour" is kicking off in May, and will be rolling through Colorado on Tuesday, August 26th. Fresh off an MTV VMA performance that has had everybody talking, this show is sure to sell out extremely fast.
In case you missed his incredible MTV VMA performances...
