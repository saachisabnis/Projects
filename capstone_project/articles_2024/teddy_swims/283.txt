Queen Bey hasn't been knocked off from the top spot yet, as she stays at Number 1 for the sixth week running! 
Beyonc√© is this week's Number 1 once again, with her country track 'TEXAS HOLD 'EM', on The Official Big Top 40!
Teddy Swims and this week's guest, Benson Boone, didn't quite manage to knock Bey from the top spot. Can anyone do it next week?
