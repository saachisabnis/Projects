Karol G made a fiery arrival at the 2nd Annual Rare Impact Fund Benefit, held in Los Angeles on Oct. 25.
She glided gracefully in a shimmering burgundy dress, its lustrous fabric catching the light and reflecting hues of deep wine and crimson. Intricate blooming details adorned the front of the garment, resembling a garden in full bloom. The bodice featured a halter neckline as the dress cascaded down the carpet, creating a captivating silhouette. 
To ground her look, she strapped into a pair of Christian Louboutin satin sandals. The design flaunted an understated silhouette, complemented by a delicate ankle strap and a fashionable square-shaped toe that enhances the overall style with sophistication. Additional features include a satin upper, an adjustable buckle closure at the ankle, and a round open toe atop a 3.9-inch covered heel.
