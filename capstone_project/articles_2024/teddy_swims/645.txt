This holiday season is truly full of "Beautiful Things." Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are currently performing on the 2024 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour presented by Capital One, and backstage during a recent tour stop, things got a little ... oily.
In a backstage video, posted by Boone on his Instagram stories, fans can see Teddy applying moisturizer to Benson's sculpted abs before taking the stage at Jingle Ball. Boone stood there, shirtless, wearing only white pants, as Swims rubbed the moisturizer on his mid section. He captioned  the clip, "There's no better moisturizer than @teddyswims." 
Benson also shared the moment in a carousel of photos, reposted by Teddy to his Instagram stories with the caption, "Boi schlick ain't it?"
Benson Boone and Teddy are set to perform at the upcoming iHeartRadio Jingle Ball in New York City at Madison Square Garden, alongside a star-studded lineup including Katy Perry, Twenty One Pilots, Tate McRae, Meghan Trainor, The Kid Laroi, Madison Beer, Gracie Abrams, Shaboozey and NCT Dream.
