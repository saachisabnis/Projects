Soul singer Stephen Day has signed with Riser House Records.
Influenced by the music of John Mayer and Glen Campbell, the Georgia native has been building his fanbase since the release of his first EP in 2015. Most recently, Day unveiled his album Gold Mine, leading him to amass over 140 million streams to date. Last year, he received his first major sync placement in the Universal Pictures movie Strays. Additionally, Day has opened for Teddy Swims, Ben Rector and Stephen Sanchez, and plans to join Lawrence on their “Family Business Tour” later this month.
“It’s not often you come across a generational talent at the beginning and we are thrilled to be a part of Stephen’s journey,” shares Megan Schultz, Label Manager, Riser House Records. “We’ll be seeing Stephen play stadiums worldwide.”
“Honestly, there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t listen to Stephen Day’s music,” adds Jennifer Johnson, President & Co-Founder, Riser House Entertainment.
“It’s truly a dream come true to have a team of people this passionate and kind put their complete faith in me as an artist and a human,” shares Day. “I feel so excited for all the music and memories to be made. Riser, it’s you and me baby!”
