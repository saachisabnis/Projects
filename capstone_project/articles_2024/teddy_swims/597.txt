first off, where’s beyonce?
second of all, i feel like an acclaimed international soloist who isn’t rlly a big hit in the uk can also still claim an artist nom. ala caroline polachek for this year’s ceremony. maybe kacey musgraves?
oh and third, noah kahan.
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
Feels like all the big singles this year have been international, so British Single is so difficult to predict because we haven’t really seen a major hit yet.
Can’t believe I’m saying this because they’re far from big hits, but either “Training Season” by Dua Lipa or “BAND4BAND” by Central Cee & Lil Baby seem like current potential winners. Maybe Raye’s “Genesis” could surprise.
Yeah. Can see one of those winning just by default at this stage. By stats the biggest eligible UK hits (unless “Murder on the Dancefloor” or “Unwritten” suddenly get nominated) are the from Artemas (“I like the way you kiss me”) and Ella Henderson (“Alibi”), neither of which feels like a winner.

Kacey makes sense, she had actual crossover hit (“I Remember Everything”) and the last time the Brits nominated American country acts was just after similar crossover hits (Lady Antebellum with “Need You Now” and Taylor Swift with “Love Story”). Plus she is one of the few modern US country acts who can manage to tour the UK successfully which helps in her favour. 
Would also look out for Arya Starr and Tems as well, both of them are playing Glastonbury later this month (former Pyramid Stage, later Other Stage) which could boast their profiles larger.

OMG… how did I forget Bey? She’s literally my photo on here too 😭yeah she’s def in too, as is Noah. Have edited my predictions!
Ezra Collective’s next album announced for a September release date. After their Mercury win and successful tour (multiple sold out dates at music hall venues, first ever UK jazz act to play Wembley period), can see the industry wanting to recognise them with healthy nom haul for them at the next ceremony. Currently predicting them for Album of the Year, Group of the Year and either Alternative/Rock or R&B as their genre field nom, even if I don’t think they belong in either.

I can see this happening too. They seem to be the type of group that the BRITs would love to honour.
Right now, I see AOTY as Coldplay, Dua, Harry (TBC), Ezra Collective, & The Last Dinner Party.
i forgot how tuned in the whole country is to Glasto. voting is obviously ages away but i suspect Dua and Coldplay will benefit
So apart from Coldplay and Dua, whom else got the biggest boast from Glastonbury. Big story of the festival seems about how Avril Lavigne and Sugababes were underbooked via crowd size, neither are eligible but wouldn’t be surprised if this boasts the goodwill for another Best Group nomination for Sugababes next they are eligible.

They’re both showing up in AOTY for sure.

Sugababes could totally show up if they get a new album out. they could really ride the 00s girl group nostalgia wave that Girls Aloud have caused with their tour
the other acts i’ve personally heard lots of really good things about are rather predictable and already BRIT nominees, the likes of Little Simz and Olivia Dean
Dua and Coldplay were both received very well so i think my original comment definitely still stands
“Brat” has now spent more time in the top 5 than “Crash” (her purposeful commercial sellout album) did in the entire top 100, period 
🇬🇧 UK Albums Charts:
#4. ‘BRAT’ (=) *peak 2* [4 weeks]
— The album has spent it’s first release month inside the top 5. pic.twitter.com/rs8PxH4sim

They NEED to give AOTY to Brat it they want be better than Grammys one year more.
‘BRAT’ is not a typical BRIT winner by any means but her existing competition is not particularly strong, so honestly it could happen
Michael Kiwanuka just commercially released “Floating Parade” the new song he’s been performing on the festival circuit this summer. 
Hopefully an album follows soon.
She’s levelled up to multiple stadium shows now. She’s so taking Best Pop at the bare minimum.
I heard it's coming home so I thought I would too (AGAIN)!!!! ❤️‍🔥 wow this was the best morning wake up call!!! YOU GUYS SOLD OUT WEMBLEY STADIUM IN MINUTES!! I love you so much we're adding another date for ya!! SATURDAY 21ST JUNE 2025, WEMBLEY STADIUM, TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW ~… pic.twitter.com/Bwql1uxVxM
