The Libertines have topped the UK albums chart for the first time in almost 20 years with their latest offering, All Quiet On The Eastern Esplanade.
The band, comprised of frontman Pete Doherty, singer and guitarist Carl Barat, drummer Gary Powell and bassist John Hassall, secured their last number one album in September 2004 with self-titled record The Libertines.
Reflecting on the achievement, the band said: “We are all of us in the gutter, but today we’re looking at the stars! Thanks for the love. We need it.”
The album has also topped the vinyl albums chart, according to the Official Charts Company, and has become the most purchased LP in UK independent record shops over the past seven days, claiming number one on the official record store chart.
The Libertines enjoyed previous top 40 success in the albums chart with Up The Bracket (2002), which peaked at number 35, compilation Time For Heroes – The Best Of The Libertines (2007), which came in at number 23, and  Anthems For Doomed Youth (2015), which went to number three.
The rock band recorded their latest LP, their first in almost nine years, at their own hotel, bar and studio – the Albion Rooms in Margate.
The name of their fourth studio album is a nod to the band’s hotel’s street address and their love for Erich Maria Remarque’s landmark anti-war novel, All Quiet On The Western Front.
Across September, October and November the band, known for songs including Can’t Stand Me Now and What Became Of The Likely Lads, will tour the UK and Ireland with dates in cities that include Dublin, Glasgow, London and Manchester.
