Carrie Underwood made a surprising return to the 2024 Country Music Association Awards.
The moment came when Cody Johnson, who was up for five awards at this year’s ceremony, took the stage to perform at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on Wednesday, November 20. While Johnson, 37, was introduced solo by hosts Luke Bryan, Lainey Wilson and Peyton Manning, the country singer had Underwood, 41, join him to perform their duet “I’m Gonna Love You.”
Johnson started the song by himself before Underwood walked out from backstage singing the second verse. Her appearance was greeted by a round of applause and cheers from the audience.
Underwood, 41, stepped out in a gown with an orange bodice, white flowy sleeves and a matching skirt. She paired the look with a statement turquoise necklace and full glam makeup Her long blonde locks had her signature waves.
After completing the verse, Underwood joined Johnson for the chorus of the heart-wrenching ballad. In between the lyrics, Johnson gave Underwood a shoutout for joining him.
“Yeah that’s Carrie Underwood,” he exclaimed which earned a big cheer from the crowd.
Once the song finished, Underwood and Johnson took a bow and shared a sweet hug as the crowd got on their feet to give the performers a standing ovation. The camera then panned to several other stars including Thomas Rhett and Teddy Swims who were shocked by the impromptu duet.
Underwood’s CMA Awards appearance was a surprise to viewers as she was not on this year’s list of performers. The singer also did not walk the red carpet ahead of the awards show. While she was up for Entertainer of the Year in 2023, Underwood has not attended the CMAs since 2022. At her last show, she performed a tribute to the late Loretta Lynn with Miranda Lambert and Reba McEntire.

While Underwood hasn’t been at the CMAs recently, she has been busy with various projects. In addition to her duet with Johnson, which dropped in September, Underwood recently returned to her American Idol roots to replace judge Katy Perry. (The panel also includes Bryan, 48, and Lionel Richie.)
“I think I can be honest and constructive, but still kind,” Underwood told radio personality Buzz Brainard in August of what to expect from her behind the judges’ table. “And I think that’s the whole point, because people are coming in and it’s [their] dream. You’re part of somebody’s story from that moment on.”
Auditions for season 23 took place in August and the season will premiere Sunday, March 9, on ABC.
