Post Malone wowed the crowd at the 2024 CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee with a performance of his sentimental father-daughter ballad.
Joined by a simple production of guitars and violins, the cross-genre musician took the spotlight as he sang his song "Yours," from his 2024 album F-1 Trillion, a song about the future when one day his daughter gets married. The crowd was moved by Post singing about someday walking his daughter down the aisle, giving him a standing ovation and continuing to welcome him into the country music family. 
His solo performance marked his second time taking the stage during the night after opening the show with an exciting duet with Chris Stapleton. 
Post, who recently revealed several tour stops with Jelly Roll planned for next year, was also announced on Wednesday as a headliner for Coachella 2025, joining other top-billed artists like Lady Gaga and Green Day as well as a full star-studded lineup for the beloved music festival set to take over Indio, California in April.
