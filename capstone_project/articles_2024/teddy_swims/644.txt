Hoda Kotb is leaving behind quite the legacy at the Today Show, but there’s one thing that she will always be known for: Her infamous drunk video calls.
She and Jenna Bush Hager shared a clip of Teddy Swims and Thomas Rhett’s show-stopping performance at this year’s Country Music Awards on Today With Hoda & Jenna. “Two of your favorite phone calls,” Bush Hager joked. “Hoda loves them.”
As they watched the clip back, Bush Hager continued teasing her co-host. “I know who Hoda will be calling come 4:30 p.m. today!” she said.
Kotb laughed as Bush Hager really set the scene for how Kotb will likely be calling them up after a couple of drinks. 
“I know who you’re going to be drunk dialing around four,” she joked. “The sun barely starts to go down, Hoda takes out her phone says, ‘Should we do it?’ to whoever she’s sitting next to.”
She then warned Rhett’s wife, Lauren Akins, to “get ready” for Kotb’s inevitable phone call.
“Another woman’s gonna be calling your man!” she announced, to which Kotb replied, “She don’t mind, she don’t mind one bit.”
Bush Hager actually warned Swims against giving Kotb his number when he visited Today With Hoda & Jenna in October. 
“Teddy, do not give Hoda your phone number,” she warned. “The sun’s gonna be just barely going down, and she might have had one drink, and she’s gonna call you, Teddy.”
She’s not wrong. Kotb admitted that her “magic hour” is usually before the sun goes down because she keeps an early bedtime as a daytime host. 
“That’s when she hangs,” Bush Hager teased. 
“That’s what I’m all about, I love that,” Swims replied.
Today with Jenna and Hoda airs on weekdays at 10/9c on NBC.
