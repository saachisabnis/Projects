Thomas Rhett appeared to hint at a cross-genre collaboration in the works o Monday (November 4). The country hitmaker teased a new spin on the title track of his latest album featuring Teddy Swims on Instagram. Rhett said this one has “been a long time coming…”
Swims, known for his soulful vocals and blending into R&B, pop, country and other genres, joined Rhett on “Somethin’ ‘Bout A Woman.” The song is one of 14 tracks that appears on Rhett’s seventh studio record, About A Woman, which released in August. The collection also includes “Overdrive,” “Gone Country,” “Beautiful As You,” “After All The Bars Are Closed” and more. Rhett previously said the album serves as a tribute to his wife, Lauren Akins. The pair recently celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary.
“From top to bottom, I wanted to exude joy and fun with this project – and really just make people move,” Rhett, who's hitting the road in 2025, said when he announced new details about his album earlier this year. “I went into making this record with a fearless attitude, put my blinders on and my head down to try and make really fun music. …I feel like if you were to ask me what this record is about, the answer would be it’s about one woman, my wife, and it gave me an opportunity to say ‘I love you’ in a lot of different ways.”
