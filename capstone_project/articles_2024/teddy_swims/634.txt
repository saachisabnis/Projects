The big Connecticut festival we all wait for every year has officially been announced.
Previously-named Sound on Sound Festival which is now called Soundside Music Festival that happens at Seaside Park in Bridgeport is back for another year. Taking place September 28 & 29, you have an amazing lineup and a weekend full of great music ahead.
On Saturday the 28, you have Noah Kahn headlining with great artists throughout the day including The Goo Goo Dolls, Fleet Foxes, Boyz II Men and so much more. On Sunday, The Foo Fighters are headlining with great music throughout the day including Queens of the Stone Age, Norah Jones, Teddy Swims and so much more. It sounds like it's going to be a great weekend, great vibes and great music.
One thing came to my attention when I saw this lineup and it was that Noah Kahn has been having immense success this year and it's making me happy. He's from Vermont and his music gives you that small town subtle vibe that I love. If you've never listened to his music, I recommend doing so.
When he posted to his page promoting that he would be headlining the festival this year, his caption caught my eye. "I forgot my wristband for this festival last year and wasn't allowed in lol and and now I'm headlining it. Life is f*cking crazy." That, my friends, is a full 360 moment.
Seeing newer artists have growing success brings me immense happiness. That is going to be such a cool moment to be able to relive. I feel bad that he forgot his wristband and wasn't able to witness the amazing sets that took place last year as a fan, but it's going to be so cool to be able to be on the other side while you're headlining Connecticut's biggest festival.
Props to you, Noah Kahan. I wish you continued success in all of the years to come.
Presale for Soundside Music Festival is taking place on Thursday, May 16 at 10 AM. For all information on the festival, you can visit the page here.
