The 25-year-old graphic designer sang an original called “I Was Wrong.” This was actually the perfect song choice given what unfolded in the audition. Katy thought he had a good-sounding voice, but had some bad habits on the delivery. Lionel put a stamp on him as an artist. Luke compared him to Paul Simon. Luke was a yes. Katy was a no. Lionel actually voted no. That hurt Luke. So much so that he asked for a crew vote. They unanimously said he was good, even host Ryan Seacrest. Tamra from Katy’s team even questioned their decision by asking, “What is wrong with you guys?” The crew caused Lionel to rethink and change his vote! Jack goes to Hollywood!

McKenna spoke about growing up with adopted parents.  The medical assistant recalled finding out her biological mom passed away and that she was a local musician who lived just a few hours away. She came in contact with other members of her birth family and found out they are into music too. They had never officially met in person. McKenna sang “There Was Jesus” by Zach Williams and Dolly Parton. The judges loved her, but the real story was what happened next. In a heartwarming moment, her adopted family brought in members of her birth family to meet McKenna for the first time. Katy was a puddle with I’m sure most of the viewers watching when McKenna started playing one of her mom’s songs “Tumbleweed” while the family listened. If this is a sign of how the rest of the season will play out, you may want to get some extra tissues.
