The lineup for the 2024 edition of Lollapalooza has been announced, with two rock headliners in Blink-182 and The Killers. But the rock quotient at this year's music weekend is a little lean.
Blink-182 and The Killers were already mentioned and they join such other top-line talent over the festival's music weekend as Sza, Tyler, the Creator, Future X, Metro Boomin, Hozier, Stray Kids and Melanie Martinez as the 2024 Lollapalooza headliners.
The rock acts mostly lean on the alternative rock side. They include 11 acts with arguably Deftones, In This Moment and Hanabie being the heaviest of the grouping. Here are the rock acts playing Lollapalooza 2024.
