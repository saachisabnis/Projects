'I am beyond thrilled to be here tonight to present the Kids' Choice Legend Award to the one and only, my friend, Serena Williams,' the Destiny Child's member began. 
'She's been making the case for legend status her entire life, ever since she was a kid. She started out training on public tennis courts in Compton, California [and] breaking into the professional ranks at just 14-years old. How many 14-year-olds out there?
'As a friend, I've watched her continue to evolve beyond the world of tennis into the cultural icon she is today, encompassing fashion, entrepreneurship and activism.
'Throughout her journey, she's always pushed herself to be the best she can be,' Rowland continued. 'But it's not just her dominance on and off the court — it's the way she champions those around her and invites others to share in her success that makes her an inspiration to us all.'
The 23-time Grand Slam winner then took the stage.
'I have so many people to thank for this amazing honor,' she began. 'First of all, thank you, Kelly, for presenting this to me. 
'This is so cool to have an incredibly special award made even more special by my wonderful friend giving it to me. Thank you, I love you so much.'
To her fans in the crowd, Williams gushed: 'Oh, my God, this is so cool. You guys are, like, the greatest crowd ever. I needed you guys at Wimbledon.

'I have to thank my entire family for believing in me,' she continued. 'I look at the crowd with so many little legends, but I want you to know wherever you come from, you can do anything you put your mind to. 
'If you can do it, I can do it,' she said. 'So, receiving the Legend Award from you all is truly a gift and it means the absolute world to me, so thank you all very much.'
