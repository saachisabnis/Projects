So a rapper, a soul artist, and a country singer walk into a club-and no this isn’t the start of a bad dad joke. Migos member Quavo, invited celebrity friends Teddy Swims and Luke Bryan for a night out on the town after releasing their latest collaboration “Georgia Ways.” He even made sure all the girls were dressed on theme complete with cowboy hats and daisy dukes! No word on how much money was spent that night, but it sure looked like a rootin’ tootin’ good time!
Collectively, the trio has achieved over 200 million singles sold and three-dozen No. 1 singles in two decades. ‘Georgia Ways’ is the first mainstream country song Quavo has released, and it has gained almost half a million views in three days!
