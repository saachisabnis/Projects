Aerosmith has announced the rescheduled dates for the “Peace Out” farewell tour, which was abruptly postponed last September because of singer Steven Tyler‘s ongoing vocal cord and larynx problems.

	The singer’s doctor said last year that Tyler, “in addition to the damage to his vocal cords, fractured his larynx, which requires ongoing care. He is receiving the best medical treatment available to ensure his recovery is swift, but given the nature of a fracture, he is being told patience is essential.”

	The postponed tour was set to kick off in Pittsburgh at PPG Paints Arena on Sept. 20 and make stops across the U.S. and Canada, including Los Angeles’ Kia Forum and New York’s Madison Square Garden. 

	










	The Peace Out tour was to celebrate 50 years of the band’s hits.
