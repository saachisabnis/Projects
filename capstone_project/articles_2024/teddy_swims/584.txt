Happy New Music Friday! The weekend is here, which means more streaming, new playlists and the best that music has to offer -- and ET has you covered for everything in between.
Normani teamed up with Gunna for her new single, "1:59," Louis Tomlinson dropped his LIVE album, and Maya Hawke released her latest, "Hang in There."
There were also some blasts from the past, as both iconic divas -- Barbra Streisand and Vanessa Williams -- and beloved groups -- New Kids on the Block, Train and Mötley Crüe -- all released new songs!
Plus, Friday marks the first day of this year’s sold-out Stagecoach Festival, California's iconic country music festival, and to celebrate, Amazon Music surprise-released a brand-new Stagecoach Amazon Music Original from global superstar Jelly Roll.
In the new single, streaming only on Amazon Music, Jelly Roll pays tribute to late country star Toby Keith with a cover of his hit, "Should've Been a Cowboy" -- the lead single off Keith's self-titled debut album back in 1993. The track also features vocals from hip-hop legend T-Pain.
Jelly Roll is donating all proceeds from the Amazon Music Original to the Toby Keith Foundation, which supports the health and happiness of pediatric cancer patients.
