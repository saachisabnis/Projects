Carrie Underwood will help ring in 2025 as the headliner of the 54th edition of ABC‘s holiday staple “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest.”
The Grammy-winning country star will take the stage in Times Square before the ball drops at midnight to perform a medley of some of her biggest hits.
She’ll lead a lineup including Lenny Kravitz, Tinashe, Teddy Swims, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Cody Johnson, Thomas Rhett and CMA New Artist of the Year Megan Moroney.
Rita Ora returns as co-host alongside Seacrest, who’s marking his 20th year leading the holiday event.
Underwood’s appearance will be her third time performing at the annual celebration since winning “American Idol” in 2005.
“I have such fun memories of performing on ‘New Year’s Rockin’ Eve’ in Times Square in both 2007 and 2015,” Underwood said in a statement Thursday. “I’m so excited to perform just before the ball drops again this year. I’m thrilled to celebrate 20 years since winning ‘American Idol’ by joining Ryan as he hosts his 20th New Year’s Eve in Times Square.”
Underwood has become one of the most successful singers to come out of “American Idol,” earning six platinum albums, eight Grammy Awards and five CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Awards. She’s thrice been named the ACM Awards Entertainer of the Year, the most of any female artist.
Next year, she’ll return to her “Idol” roots, replacing Katy Perry on the competition’s star-studded judging panel. She’ll join returning judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan, while Seacrest will once again serve as host.
“Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” airs live Dec. 31 on ABC, beginning at 8 p.m., and will stream on Hulu the following day.
