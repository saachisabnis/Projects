Thousands of screenshots. A growing list of unopened texts and emails. Yet another notification that your phone’s storage is almost full. That’s the reality for many of us in the digital age. But be warned: If your device is filled with too much digital clutter, it could be affecting your mental health and productivity.
Here’s what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart.
