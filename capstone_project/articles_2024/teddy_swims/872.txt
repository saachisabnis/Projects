Taylor Swift’s discography took over the airwaves in 2024, landing her Spotify’s global top artist spot for the second year in a row.
The streaming platform revealed on Wednesday, December 4, that Swift, 34, was the most-streamed global artist again. The pop star had more than 26.6 billion streams, with The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish rounding out the top five.
Alongside the announcement, Swift sent a sweet message to her loyal listeners on the app. “Hi, I just wanted to say thank you so much for being one of my top listeners on Spotify, that’s so nice of you,” Swift said in a video message. “I look back on this year and I think about how special you guys made it for us being on the Eras Tour.”
“We went all over the world. We went to Europe, Australia, Asia, back through America then to Canada. And so thank you if you came to see the show, thank you for streaming the music,” she continued. “It’s just been such a wild ride, and I really appreciate everything you guys have done — including listening to my music so much. So cool.”
In celebration of Swift’s status, Spotify placed a special Wrapped badge on her profile and had custom mini animation designs for each era. For 1989 (Taylor’s Version), seagulls were visible on the Spotify Play Button, while Fearless (Taylor’s Version) featured sparkles and The Tortured Poets Department displayed papers.
The Eras Tour performer also had the top-streamed album of the year with TTPD, followed by Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet, Karol G’s Mañana Será Bonito and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine.

Swift, however, did not have the top song of the year. The most streamed song was “Espresso” by Carpenter, 25, who was an opener for Swift’s Eras Tour. That track was followed by “Beautiful Things” by Benson Boone, “Birds of a Feather” by Eilish, “Gata Only” by FloyyMenor and Cris Mj and “Lose Control” by Teddy Swims.
The accolade came one day after Apple Music named Swift the top artist of 2024 and TTPD the top album. She also earned the same nods on Amazon Music.
“Ahhhhhh thank you for listening to my music and TTPD so much!!!! You, the fans, made The Tortured Poets Department the TOP STREAMED ALBUM of The Year on @applemusic!!!” Swift wrote via her Instagram Story on Tuesday, December 3. “You guys snagged me that Top Streamed Artist spot too.”
