Teddy Swims by day ... Santa Claus by night? The singer/songwriter showed up to the iHeartRadio Z100 Jingle Ball in one look, and then transformed into another very festive look that went way beyond just an outfit change. You might say, it's the magic of Christmas.
Taking the stage at New York City's iconic Madison Square Garden, Teddy transformed into a modern tattooed Santa Claus, wearing a red wide brim hat, matching red suit and tie, and even turned his beard white while he performed songs including "The Door," "What More Can I Say," "Hammer To The Heart," "Bad Dreams" and "Lose Control." He even signed a fan's sign while singing the latter.
Needless to say Teddy delivered the best gift of all: an absolutely epic performance.
