The Fresh Prince got Fridayy and Sunday Service together for a new uplighting song, "You Can Make It."

Doechii's new single, “Rocket” is part of Sprite Limelight Season 3.
Sprite Limelight's original tracks center around a core “hook” created by Grammy-nominated producers Take A Daytrip, who Sprite recruited as musical creative directors for season three. Each artist had the freedom to reinterpret the hook according to their own unique artistic vision – sampling it, re-singing it, changing lyrics or melodies – to infuse it with their own artistry and tell their personal stories of heat in their lives and how they pushed through.
In “Style Rare,” Offset and Gunna reunite to rap about spending tons of money, splurging on girls, and showing off their big purchases.
“Went Hollywood For A Year” is the second single off of Lil Durk’s ninth studio album, Love Songs 4 the Streets 3. 
On the track, Lil Durk taps into his soft side to open up about the street life in Chicago. 
Latto is talking that talk in her new single, "Big Mama."
"Thought I told you b**ches, I pull up in twenty Cadillacs, yeah (Skrrr)," the Atlanta native raps. "Money long, cheetah thong, thick as hell, Georgia Don.Sharin' n**gas, sharin' clothes, I don't know what y'all be on. Y'all go for s**t I wouldn't, I'm 'bout three hunnid to book it. B**ch, I don't play for the Knicks, but I'm gon' shoot s**t up, I book it (On God, brr)."
In “911,” Roddy Ricch expresses his particular taste in women.
The visual to the song portrays the Compton rapper as a safeguard, responding to crimes and saving women from kidnappings or housefires, just like a 911 responder would do. 
This serves as the second single from Roddy Ricch’s third studio album, The Navy Album.
“All Kind of Ideas” is the third single off of Common and Pete Rock's upcoming album The Auditorium, Vol. 1 out July 12.
The visuals focus on the duo hard at work, in a style that embodies the nostalgic underground hip hop scene of the 90s from which both got their start.
This is the final installment in the Afrobeats artist and producer's Pheelz Good trilogy.
Niniola joins Pheelz for the infectious opener on the EP, “FEVER,” an energetic jam filled with flirtatious lyrics.
