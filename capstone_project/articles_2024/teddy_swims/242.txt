The revival of "American Idol" continues with its seventh season on ABC and 22nd overall. The Season 22 Top 24 were chosen from those who survived Hollywood Week. Each of these contestants had to sing in the Showstopper round to convince the three judges that they deserved a place in the "American Idol" Top 24.
In turn, each of these finalists performed for America's vote from Aulani, a Disney Resort and Spa in Ko Olina, Hawaii. Grammy winner Tori Kelly and Grammy nominee Jelly Roll served as mentors. America's votes will be revealed on Monday, April 15 when host Ryan Seacrest announces the Top 10 and the judges save four more artists to continue in the competition. Will your favorites make the cut?

Contestants are not as good as former seasons! Hard to get excited for them, and may switch channel to see something else. Will be watching the Voice on Monday!! Much better talent and excitement!!!

Triston Harper rocked it
Triston Harper is amazing! I think you’ll be a household name one day! It’s hard to believe he’s 15 years old with that voice😍
Tristen Harper Has Talent Has Confidence Has Showman Ship He the Real Thing Complete Package God Given Talent
Tristen’s mom is giving soccer mom, which is a turn off. 
I like Will, Mia, Odell and Jack.
Duh? Soccer mom ? She’s not singing!
Triston Harper was amazing as only being 15 years old.   He absolutely is dominating the other contestants.  I have never met Triston even though I live in Millry and visit Mccintosh regularly to visit family there like Miss Clara Weaver.   Miss Clara says that I’m related to Triston.   That makes it even more exciting for me
Not the best year only a couple worth listening to  Tristan Harper, Will Moseley, Mia Mathews, Emmy Russell   I know they are mostly country but the others are either just ok or too much like artists already out there
Tristan will win for sure
Triston family on both sides are very talented go nephew
I’m praying for you Triston !
