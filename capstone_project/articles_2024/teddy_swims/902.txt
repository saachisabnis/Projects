Luke Combs showed exactly why there "Ain't No Love In Oklahoma" in a fiery at the 2024 CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.
The country star took the stage to perform his hit song, featured in the 2024 blockbuster film Twisters, and the design seemingly drew inspiration from the film, with rocks and rubble strewn around as smoke flooded the stage. Lightning flashing, blazing fire and sparks flying off structures destroyed by a storm completed the picture of a storm-ravaged scene.
The passionate performance struck a chord with the star-studded crowd, causing many of country music's biggest artists to jam along as Combs sang, "Ain't no love in Oklahoma/ Just the whistle of a long black train/ You'll know when it's coming for ya/ Riding in on the wind and rain."
Combs, who also opened his own bar called Category 10 in downtown Nashville earlier this month, recently gave fans some new insight into his cover of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" — including the mistaken lyric that made him want to "crawl in a hole."
Hosted by returning duo Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning as well as newcomer Lainey Wilson to round out the superstar trio, the 58th CMA Awards featured performances from artists like Wilson, Kelsea Ballerini, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Post Malone, Kacey Musgraves, Eric Church, Thomas Rhett, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey, Ashley McBryde and many more.
Don't miss out on seeing who took home awards during the big night, including George Strait, who was honored with the 2024 Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award as well as an unforgettable star-powered tribute.
