If you've ever seen Benson Boone perform live, then you are no stranger to his on-stage gymnastics abilities â€” but it also translates off stage too.
Just before taking the stage at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball presented by Capital One, Boone walked the red carpet backstage as Teddy Swims' biggest fan while wearing some Swims merch. But while on the carpet, he showed off his incredible backflip skills in a very impressive display. See the flip, frame by nail-biting frame below.
First thing's first: he gave a thumbs up, signaling that he was ready.

Then, he got into position with the back half of his feet hanging off of the step stool.

Someone give this man a gold medal.
Aside from the New York City stop, Boone also performed on the Los Angeles and Chicago stops on this year's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour presented by Capital One, and will also be performing in Boston and Miami.
Relive the magic of the season's holiday tour as iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour stops will be part of the exclusive network special on ABC, airing December 18th, and next day on Hulu.
