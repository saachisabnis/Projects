Foo Fighters will no longer perform at Connecticut’s Soundside Music Festival, where the band was scheduled to headline alongside Noah Kahan on Saturday, Sept. 28.

	The band made the announcement on Instagram, writing, “Foo Fighters will no longer be appearing at this weekend’s Soundside Music Festival. Please check the festival website for more information.”

	Soundside — a new festival taking place in Bridgeport, Conn. — was the only scheduled upcoming performance from Foo Fighters. While a specific reason for the band’s cancellation was not disclosed, the news comes just two weeks after frontman Dave Grohl revealed in an Instagram post that he had recently become the father of a child outside of his marriage.

	“I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her. I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness,” Grohl wrote in a post on Sept. 10. “We’re grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved, as we move forward together.”

	Foo Fighters have not played a show since Sept. 6, where the band performed a short set in Anaheim for a private event. The band’s last public performance was on Aug. 18, at T-Mobile Park in Seattle.

Aside from Kahan, the lineup includes Goo Goo Dolls, Fleet Foxes and Boyz II Men on Saturday. Jack White and Greta Van Fleet are set to headline on Sunday, with additional artists including Bleachers, Norah Jones and Teddy Swims.
