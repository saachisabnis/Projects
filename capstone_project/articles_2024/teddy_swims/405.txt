Since Teddy Swims took over the charts with “Lose Control,” he’s acquired millions of fans, but he’s super excited that one particular celebrity is into his music.
Teddy shared a video originally posted by Chocolate Sundaes Comedy Show of comedian and actor Donnell Rawlings, best known for Chappelle’s Show, onstage at The Laugh Factory in Hollywood. Rawlings sings a bit of “Lose Control,” then asks someone in the audience, “Do you like that song?” When the person says no, Rawlings says, “You a racist.”
The video is captioned, “Who knew @donnellrawlings was a @teddyswims fan!”
Sharing the video, Teddy wrote in his Instagram Story, “This just makes me so happy.”
Donnell’s IG post includes a screenshot of an article with the headline “Teddy Swims got comedian Donnell Rawlings out here singing ‘Lose Control’ at comedy shows.” He captioned the post, “Somethings got a hold of me lately and i don’t know myself anymore…… I lose CONTROOOOOL @teddyswims The streets [f***] with you son!”
Teddy replied in the comments, “This is top 5 moments of my life.”
There also exists video of Rawlings singing the entire song with his band at The Comedy Store.
