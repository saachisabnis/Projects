“New episodes and unpredictable fun” await fans of The Kelly Clarkson Show in just a couple weeks! Host and executive producer Kelly Clarkson‘s daytime talk show returns for Season 6 on Monday, Sept. 23.
Among the show’s upcoming guests are Kristen Bell, Halle Berry, Adam Brody, Michael Bublé, Jim Carrey, Colin Farrell, Jelly Roll, Anna Kendrick, Adam Lambert, Trevor Noah, Teddy Swims, Uma Thurman, Keith Urban, Ali Wong, Kate Winslet, Questlove, and Zachary Quinto, as well as the casts of Emily in Paris and Wicked, per a press release shared with DECIDER on Monday.
In addition to this star-studded guest lineup, fans can expect “more show-stopping Kellyoke performances” from Clarkson herself, who “has covered over 800 songs across every genre.”
According to the release, Season 6 is slated to begin with a 30 Rock rooftop party, and “the premiere week event will feature Clarkson performing a show-stopping Kellyoke medley with My Band Y’all.” Best of all, the audience will be comprised of New Yorkers, “including The Kelly Clarkson Show Good Neighbors and Rad Humans, all of whom are stepping up in big ways for their local communities.”
Per a 2022 press release from NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, The Kelly Clarkson Show was renewed through 2025, taking the show into its next season. Clarkson kicked off her hosting gig in 2019. 
In other talk show news, The Drew Barrymore Show was picked up until 2026, also bringing the show into its sixth season. In the wake of the announcement, Drew Barrymore teased that she will “try to practice physical distance” — which she admitted is “not [her] strong point” — in the upcoming fifth season, which airs on Sept. 9.
The Kelly Clarkson Show Season 6 premieres on Monday, Sept. 23. Check out their website for your local listings.
