Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest has announced its first batch of performers for its annual Dec. 31 ABC TV special.
A promo reveals that Thomas Rhett and Cody Johnson will be performing on the show, as well as Lenny Kravitz, who’ll be doing a live countdown to 2025 from Las Vegas.
Also joining the party are R&B singer Tinashe and “Lose Control” hitmaker Teddy Swims. You may recall that Teddy and Thomas recently released a duet version of Thomas’ “Somethin’ Bout a Woman” and performed together at this year’s CMA Awards.
Joining Ryan Seacrest as co-host once again is singer/actress Rita Ora.
More performers will be announced in the coming weeks.
