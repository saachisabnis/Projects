“Get Back” isn’t just one of The Beatles most popular songs, it’s also the theme to this month’s The Tell. The monthly storytelling showcase features locals taking the stage and recounting a story in line with that show’s theme. Whether participants will be inspired by The Beatles tune, a past period in their life, a dire warning or the urge to reclaim something or come up with a completely different take on the subject will be revealed Thursday night. The show starts at 7 p.m. at Cellar 624, The Venue on Main, at 624 Main Ave., Fargo. Forum reporter John Lamb is one of this month’s judges. Admission is $15, cash.
Friday
It’s been a pretty rapid rise to the top of the charts for Teddy Swims. After first releasing material in 2019, he topped the charts four years later with the soulful R&B burn of “Lose Control.” Following the single “Some Things I’ll Never Know” with country singer Maren Morris, he returned to the charts with “The Door,” from his debut album, “I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy.” One year after releasing that album, he’ll play Essentia Health Plaza at The Lights in West Fargo. Tickets range from $55 to $150, plus fees.

Friday
After performing with David Lee Roth, Marilyn Manson, Rob Halford and Rob Zombie, guitarist John 5 was known in hard rock circles, but when Mötley Crüe announced that he was replacing the retiring Mick Mars, the axe man became more of a household name. He’ll be stepping out on his own when he plays Fargo’s Sanctuary Events Center on Friday night. In live performances he’s been mixing up his original material with covers and a medley of Mötley Crüe. Tickets range from $39.50 to $49.50.

Donald S. Clark’s photographs have long shown the intersection of humans and nature, sometimes how people affect the environment and sometimes how the landscape leaves its mark on individuals. The latter in the case with his latest book project, “Nature’s Writers: Mentored by the Land,” which was just published by Rizzoli. 
Since 2019, the photographer has visited the places that impacted 40 major American nature essayists, fiction writers and poets, from John Muir to Barbara Kingsolver and shares the awe-inspiring views. The Minnesota State University of Moorhead teacher will talk about his work at an 11 a.m. Saturday book launch at Ferguson Books in West Fargo and sign copies until 1 p.m.
