In an exclusive backstage interview at Hard Rock Live in Rockford, I had the chance to sit down with the incredibly talented Teddy Swims.
Teddy shared the lifechanging decision he made that landed him where he is today.  He gave himself six months to land a record deal, a commitment that led him to quit his job and focus entirely on his music.
Miraculously, he secured that deal just one day before the six-month mark hit!
When I asked Teddy about what's next in his music career, he revealed plans for a new record set to release in January 2025 but no set date.
Now, news just dropped when his record, “I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 2)", will be here!
"Scheduled to drop Monday, January 24th 2025, the record looks set to build upon the massive success of “Part 1”, which spawned the international hit singles “Lose Control” and “The Door”, as well as the singers latest release “Bad Dreams”, which debuted at #28 on the UK Top 40, giving Teddy three songs on the UK chart (“The Door” #13, “Lose Control” #25), in addition to also hitting #1 on the UK Airplay charts."
But that’s not all—Teddy is gearing up for a European arena tour that has already sold out Wembley Stadium, TWICE, which can hold 90,000 guests.
Teddy Swims literally manifested his music career. Teddy Swims embodies the dreamer who turned aspirations into reality, and I can’t wait to see where this next chapter takes him!
Who's ready to see where Teddy Swims will be within the next 12 months?  I'm pretty sure he'll be one of the top artists in the world... he's on track!
