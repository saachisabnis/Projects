Here's a round-up of all the most iconic moments with Capital's Jingle Bell Ball 2024 with Barclaycard, from Katy Perry's splits on stage to Joel Corry's flame thrower!
Both nights of Capital’s Jingle Bell Ball 2024 with Barclaycard were nights to remember. From Katy Perry doing the splits on stage and Perrie singing her brand-new track 'Christmas Magic' to Joel Corry getting shirtless and going nuts with a flame thrower, yes you heard that right.
Over 16,000 fans filed into The O2 arena on December 7th and 8th to watch the star-studded lineup including Coldplay, Katy Perry, Joel Corry, Perrie, Ella Henderson, Sigala, Tom Grennan, KSI and more.
Everything came together like a Christmas miracle so it was hard to pick the stand-out moments but here's a recap of some of the best bits we never want to forget!
This may not have been on your bingo cards tonight, but Joel Corry decided to take night two to the next level as he whipped off his shirt and accompanied his playlist with a casual flame thrower moment. We're OBSESSED.
In the middle of his set, KSI grabbed a fan's phone in the arena pit and chatted to whoever was on the other end -  another fan who, through the screen, was having the time of their life!
Becky Hill didn't come to play, tearing up the stage of the O2 with not only her incredible vocals but a killer head-to-toe red look. 
Fans lost their minds when Craig David magically appeared on stage as a surprise guest! It especially felt like a Christmas miracle when he performed his iconic 2000s hits '7 Days' and 'Walking Away'.
Kygo took to the keys during an emotional number which saw Swedish singer Sandro Cavazza jump on top of the piano for the climax of the song. 
Katy reminded us all why she’s the queen of pop when during ‘I’m His, He’s Mine’ she got her dancers to flip her upside down before landing into the splits.

Annnnd one final Katy moment that finished off the night. We just had to mention when Katy iconically finished on her super hit ‘Firework’ and left the audience in awe as delicate butterfly confetti cascaded from the skies.
Tom Grennan got the party started by performing all his favourite hits like 'Higher' and 'Little Bit Of Love.'
Clean Bandit won over the audience at Capital's Jingle Bell Ball as soon as Grace Chatto walked on stage with her bedazzled mirror ball cello.
Sigala's performance peaked when he turned his own phone torch on and held up it up during his track 'Lasting Lover,' encouraging the entire arena to do so as well. 
The O2 was set alight.
Teddy Swims performed a heartfelt cover of 'You're Still The One' by Shania Twain. The song was one of the covers he uploaded on YouTube during the pandemic that kick-started his career back in the day. 
Perrie performed her Christmas track 'Christmas Magic' in an intimate acoustic performance for fans earlier in the month. However, Capital's Jingle Bell Ball was Perrie's first time performing the track for a huge arena.
I've got something in my eye, I swear! Playing songs from across their entire discography - from 'Paradise' and 'A Sky Full of Stars' to 'We Pray' out of their newest album - Coldplay wowed us with their #CapitalJBB set.
We loved every moment, but we'd have to say it was when Chris Martin sang their 2008 hit 'Viva La Vida' that he truly got everyone in the arena up on their feet.
