Every week, Billboard unveils the top 10 songs on the latest Hot 100 chart. The most recent rankings, for the chart dated July 20, are out now, so let’s run down who had this week’s biggest hits.
Swims might be starting to lose control, as he breakout his is on the verge of leaving the top 10 on the latest chart.
“Beautiful Things” unfortunately never quite found its way up to No. 1 (peaking at No. 2), but its lengthy run of success continues with another week in the upper region of the Hot 100.
Hozier’s biggest single to date is still crushing it in the top 10 after becoming the “Take Me To Church” singer’s first No. 1 song.
“Lies Lies Lies” is a new top-10 hit for Wallen as it debuts at No. 7 this week. It’s his milestone tenth top-10 song.
Here’s some specific trivia: Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” and Wallen’s “Lies Lies Lies” are the first pair of songs with titles consisted of three repeated words to be ranked back-to-back on the Hot 100, or to even be in the top 10 together at all.
“Espresso” might end up being the song of the summer, and it’s still going strong by maintaining its top-5 status this week.
In addition to climbing up a spot this week, “Million Dollar Baby” is No. 1 on the Hot R&B Songs chart for an 11th week.
After spending six total weeks at No. 1, and then hanging out at No. 2 last week, Malone and Wallen’s hit country collab slips to No. 3. Wallen, by the way, and Carpenter are the only two artists this week with multiple top-10 songs.
Last week, Shaboozey scored his first No. 1 song with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” but now it has had to cede that title to a returning favorite.
Sorry, Drake: “Not Like Us” is No. 1 again after spending last week at No. 3. This is the song’s second week at No. 1 and its first time on top in a whopping nine weeks. It’s only the third non-holiday song to ever go at least that long between No. 1 weeks, after Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” in 2013 and Olivia Rodrigo’s “Vampire” in 2023 (also nine weeks for both).
