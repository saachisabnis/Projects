John Legend performed during the Democratic National Convention Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2024, in Chicago.
Summer is ending, and it is signing off with some amazing concerts and comedy shows in September. Here are our picks for the month's must-see concerts, which include Billy Joel and Sting, John Legend, Sarah Silverman and some honorable mentions.
EGOT winner John Legend is bringing music magic back to the Muny. Accompanied by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Legend’s performance is the first live concert at the storied theater in over 30 years. Expect to hear renditions of songs from his 2022 album "Legend," as well as symphonic spins on classic tracks like "Ordinary People" and "Tonight (Best You Ever Had)." The concert is Legend’s first time performing with the St. Louis Symphony and perhaps the beginning of a new era of live music performances at the Muny.

He's come a long way since graduating from Ladue High School or learning magic at Gibbol’s Novelties and Costumes.
Most old-school hip hop heads are familiar with Talib Kweli. The Brooklyn emcee has been shaking up the scene for nearly 20 years. Whether he’s spitting a hot 16 alongside fellow Black Star member Yasiin Bey, formerly known as Mos Def, or stirring the pot on Twitter, Kweli’s bars have spoken for themselves for decades. His City Winery performance comes just days before the release of “The Confidence of Knowing,” a collaborative album between Kweli and Black Star producer J. Rawls.

Cage the Elephant is finally riding high after a tumultuous several years that saw the band deal with the death of loved ones and frontman Matt Schltz's arrest and hospitalization. Schultz was arrested in January 2023 for having firearms in his room a Manhattan hotel. He says he'd been suffering from psychosis due to medication. After he recovered, he focused on finishing the band's latest album, "Neon Pill." According the Associated Press, the result is "a kaleidoscope of rock."

Rapper Sexyy Red is one of the latest music sensations to emerge from St. Louis. Her provocative, outspoken raps have gained head nods from hip hop artists like Drake and Nicki Minaj and the up-and-coming rapper represents her hometown every chance she gets. Sexyy Red's brand of in-your-face rap is full of controversial lyrics that keep going viral. Her “Get It Sexyy” was certified gold and her 2023 hit “Pound Town” went platinum. Rumor has it, Sexyy Red is bringing a few special guests to her show, with rappers Hunxho, Blakeiana, and Loe Shimmy kicking things off.

Ice Cube has reigned as a jack-of-all-trades in the entertainment industry for decades: he raps, acts and even owns his own basketball league. However, it was his bold lyrics with NWA back in 1988 that influenced a new generation of rappers. It’ll be "a good day" when Ice Cube hits the stage at the Factory to perform some of his iconic tracks that reshaped hip hop culture.

Sarah Silverman arrives at a special screening of “Maestro” on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.

Alt-rock bands the Used and Story of the Year will say help fans say good-bye to summer and are bringing a few friends along: the Plain White T’s and Raue. (This is your chance to belt out Plain White T's "Hey There Delilah" at the top of your lungs in memory of romances of summers past.)

Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional performs on day three of the Lollapalooza Music Festival on Saturday, July 30, 2022, at Grant Park in Chicago.
Dashboard Confessional has been a force in alternative rock for over 20 years. However, its 2022 album "All The Truth That I Can Tell" is all about stumbling through fear towards rediscovery. The album was released two years after frontman Chris Carrabba was in near-fatal motorcycle accident, forcing him to relearn his instrument and see life through a different lens.

The Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Grammy-nominated rock band has released 18 studio albums over the last 35 years and done 15 million in album sales. Frontman Ed Robertson's songwriting is still full of wit, humor and raw humanness. Add to that Jim Creeggan’s bass thumps, Kevin Hearn's (keyboard, guitars) melodies and Tyler Stewart on the drums, and you've got an act built to last.
Musician Billy Joel performs during his 100th lifetime performance at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, July 18, 2018, in New York.
