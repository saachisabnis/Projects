A trio of 90s music legends have been confirmed as next year’s Isle of Wight headliners.
The festival has made its first lineup announcement for the 2025 event, which will take place on June 19-22 with 13 bands revealed this month before tickets go on sale later this week.
Sting, Stereophonics and Justin Timberlake will each close the Friday, Saturday and Sunday night respectively, bringing plenty of nostalgia to the stage.
Other bands on the bill include Faithless, The Script, Clean Bandit, The Lottery Winners, James and Olly Murs.
Rounding off the first wave of acts are Teddy Swims, Example, Paul Heaton, Texas, Alison Moyet, Dean Lewis and The Lathums.
Festival promoter John Giddings said: ‘What a line-up we have in store already for the next edition of The Isle of Wight Festival.
‘This first announcement spans global music icons to the freshest new talent and we have many more names to come so stay tuned. Everyone should get to the island over 19th – 22nd June 2025 for an unforgettable weekend of music.’
Reaction to the lineup has been mixed to say the least, with some fans hailing it ‘fantastic’ with others less than impressed after this year’s bill.
‘Belting. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Can. Not. Wait. Bravo @JohnGiddings01 @IsleOfWightFest,’ wrote @claresby, while @dragonfly_paul added: ‘Another brilliant mix of old and new, something for all members of the family… cannot wait… 🥳’
However, @rowanpowell4 argued that ‘even Stereophonics couldn’t save this’, with @msemmaphillips claiming the headliners are ‘awful’ besides the Dakota rockers.
‘Lower down the bill looks good but Green Day to Justin Timberlake in the space of a year seems odd,’ said. @FawcusJack, with @DanChester81 teasing: ‘Is this from 2004?’
‘Fair play that is absolutely awful,’ complained @MichaelConnor27, with @DeanMawson describing the headliners as ‘prehistoric’.
And @Leftyrevolutain added: ‘Stereophonics is literally the only band worth watching so far, i mean Greenday to Justin Timberlake what a downgrade.’
Sting’s Friday night slot comes as part of his Sting 3.0 world tour, covering his iconic back catalogue including Roxanne, Englishman In New York and more.
Stereophonics are returning to the festival for the first time in three years, while Justin Timblerlake will close the festival on the Sunday night.
Clean Bandit, Example and James will headline the Big Top stage each night.As well as the first acts on the lineup, Isle of Wight have also launched Experience 25 at The O2 in London to celebrate all 25 festivals so far.
Starting with the original Isle of Wight through to this year’s, the free exhibition will feature photos, videos, memorabilia and special art installations.
The experience – which will include nods to this year’s event with headliners Green Day, The Prodigy and Pet Shop Boys – will run until November 13.
