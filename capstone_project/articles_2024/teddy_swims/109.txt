	Jelly Roll is a finalist for three BBMAs: top song sales artist, top rock artist and top hard rock song, the latter for his featured role on Falling in Reverse’s “All My Life.”

	Jelly landed his first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 in October with Beautifully Broken. He has amassed eight top 40 hits on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, including “Need a Favor” (No. 13), “I Am Not Okay” (No. 14) and “Save Me” (with Lainey Wilson, No. 19).

	As previously announced, Zach Bryan, Taylor Swift, Morgan Wallen and Sabrina Carpenter are the leading finalists for the 2024 Billboard Music Awards.

	This marks the show’s return to FOX, which carried the show from its 1990 inaugural broadcast through 2006. In addition, Paramount+ will provide on-demand streaming of the show, while the free Fire TV Channels app will provide one-click access to fans using Amazon devices (Fire TV smart TVs and streaming media players and Fire Tablets).

	The BBMAs will celebrate music’s greatest achievements with exclusive original performances, artist interviews, and award celebrations taking place from global locations and in the midst of sold-out tours. Shaboozey will deliver a special performance from W Hollywood, part of the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio. Additional performers and special guests will be announced soon.

	The BBMAs honors the year’s biggest artists, albums, songs, producers and songwriters across multiple genres, as determined by year-end performance metrics on the Billboard charts. The eligibility dates for this year’s awards are aligned with Billboard’s Year-End Charts tracking period, which measures music consumption from the charts dated Oct. 28, 2023 through Oct. 19, 2024.
