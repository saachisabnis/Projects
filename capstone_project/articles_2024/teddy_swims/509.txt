The Foo Fighters have pulled out of a major Connecticut music festival just three days before they were scheduled to play, amid the burgeoning scandal over frontman Dave Grohl’s extramarital love child.
Their Sunday performance at the Soundside Music Festival in Bridgeport was the last scheduled date of their tour supporting “But Here We Are,” the album they released last year. They have traversed the country all summer promoting their most recent work.
“Foo Fighters will no longer be appearing at this weekend’s Soundside Music Festival,” the band announced tersely on social media. “Please check the festival website for more information.”
The festival swapped in Jack White and Greta Van Fleet to fill the slot, but did not offer any other explanation, saying only, “Unfortunately, Foo Fighters have announced they will no longer be performing this weekend.” The Foo Fighters were among the headliners for the two-day Seaside Park festival, which also features Bleachers, Norah Jones, Teddy Swims and several other performers.
The cancellation comes two weeks after Grohl admitted that he had cheated on his wife and fathered a child with another woman. The 55-year-old married Jordyn Blum in 2003 and together they share three daughter.
The former Nirvana drummer reportedly retained a divorce lawyer shortly before the revelation.
Grohl has not reveal details about his new daughter or the woman he fathered her with.
