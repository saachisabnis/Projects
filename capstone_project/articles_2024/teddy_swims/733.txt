Country and hip-hop crossovers are not new. Twenty years ago, rapper Nelly and country star Tim McGraw went to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with “Over and Over.” Now, rapper Quavo is teasing a new track with country star Luke Bryan and genre-fluid artist Teddy Swims. The three unlikely collaborators bond over their shared home state in “Georgia Ways,” which drops Dec. 6.
What do Luke Bryan, Quavo, and Teddy Swims have in common? Admittedly, not much—except all three proudly hail from the Peach State.
Bryan grew up on a peanut farm in the small town of Leesburg. Swims hails from Conyers, about 24 miles east of downtown Atlanta. And Quavo spent his childhood with his fellow Migos members in the Atlanta suburb of Gwinnett County.

Taking to social media Tuesday (Nov. 26), the “Bad and Boujee” hitmaker shared a snippet of “Georgia Ways,” which he called “an anthem for my Georgia Dawgs.” The video shows close-up shots of Bryan, Quavo and Swims—the latter two sporting matching gold grills.
State pride is on full display as they sing, That’s just how I was raised / Stuck in my Georgia ways / Don’t care ’bout what you say / Some s— won’t ever change.

By Wednesday morning, the clip had collected nearly 50,000 “likes” on Instagram. “YES! Does this mean America is healing?” one Instagram user commented. “Because we need the glory days back when hip-hop and country crossovers SLAPPED! @thetimmcgraw and @nelly have 24 hours to respond.”
Another added, “Plz don’t let UGA in the natty because I already know this their new Theme Song.”
Quavo a smart man, he knows what they gonna use for sports telecasts and commercials🔥🔥🔥
A Luke Bryan-Teddy Swims-Quavo collab may seem like it came out of left field. However, the 33-year-old rapper has showed off his musical flexibility throughout 2024. He even teamed up with Lana Del Rey in July on the country-trap number “Tough.”
