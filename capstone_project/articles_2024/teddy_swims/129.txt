 apparently the whole industry sided with her about the abuse from some fans. 
Considering what she said happened (she was hounded by fans at an airport, she currently has a stalker, she was KISSED BY A FAN AT A BAR?????, her family members phone numbers have leaked), she was way too polite IMO. She should’ve ripped people to shreds over a fan kissing her, that’s so gross.
I think AOTY is probably gonna go to Billie, but I’d love a scenario where Chappell wins either BPVA or AOTY. The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is an incredible album, and the build up it’s had in success has been unbelievable. I’d love to see it awarded.

only 4 people won AOTY and BNA in the same year
And only 6 won AOTY for a debut album

I didn’t say it was going to win, I said I’d like to see it win. Plus trust me I’m not one that needs Grammy education

I’m shocked Beyonce did an interview. It’s the first time in years.

To be fair, half of it is about selling whiskey. But yeah, agreed, it seems significant

It was perfect timing with the CMA snubs. I think she will play the game, amplifying her narrative and trying to follow a path similar to “The Chicks.” Do y’all think it would help her case if she submitted to Country/Americana Album (assuming NARAS welcomes her) or didn’t submit to a genre album at all?
my winner predictions
aoty: hit me hard and soft
roty: die with a smile
soty: die with a smile
bna: chappell roan
bpsp: good luck, babe!
bpva: the rise and fall of a midwest princes
bpdgp: die with a smile.
dance album: brat*.
dance record: girl, so confusing ft lorde*
dance pop record: guess ft billie eilish
brp: not like us
brmp: like that*.
bra: we won’t trust you.
brs: euphoria or not like us
best music video: not like us
best music film: let be
*if eligible
observations: I would like Megan and Kacey to win something in country, I believe Megan will be in best new artist and Kacey is a darling of the genre so I have hopes despite Chris’ album, Beyoncé will lose everything in the big 4 and in country, but will win in American Roots. Zach Bryan, Teddy Swims, Taylor, Sabrina, Hozier, Benson Boone and maybe Shaboozey lost everything

The fact that three of them happened in the last 25 years, one of them only 4 years ago, feels like it’s much more of a possibility these days. I think the push towards younger, more diverse academy members changes the biases. And in a female-dominated year, I wouldn’t rule out the possibility.

I feel like withholding from a genre category is a bad look, unless her label campaigns hard making AOTY seem inevitable. Otherwise, it just looks like Eric Cartman saying “screw youbguys, I’m going home”

 Of course they did. The only ones that didn’t side with Chappell are crazy obsessive fans that think they have owners rights over their favorite celebrities. Chappell said what a lot of the others in the music industry feel but were scared to say. 
Are they also on her side for cancelling concerts to prep for one performance

really? Beyoncé makes a point of how weird genres are on the album. she did not want to conform to a genre’s typical traits. not submitting to an album genre category would just be her putting that into practice
some artists just do not want to be boxed in and that’s okay
It seems that select record stores will be having listening parties for the new deluxe version of "The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess" on its anniversary, Sept. 22 pic.twitter.com/NxduEalN80

Interesting… She previously said she wasn’t interested in a deluxe album (and GLB is confirmed for album #2). It’s either nothing and the wording is intentionally misleading, or it contains the demo versions of some of songs that appeared on Tidal earlier last week.
There’s one thing about Cowboy Carter that I don’t understand. First of all, we all know that it is not a country album and cannot be put in any other genre since it is usually a Beyoncé album. She announced it as a ( Beyoncé album). Then on American Requiem, she says “If that ain’t country, tell me what it is?” Referring to the CMA controversy. Plus  on Spaghettii, Linda Martell says “Genres are a funny little concept, aren’t they?” So, should it be considered a country album or not? And if this is not the case, it would be hypocritical of her to submit it in any genre category.
COWBOY CARTER ALBUM OF THE YEAR

I think people misconstrued her words from the onset. I think what she meant to say was, don’t expect your typical Country album like Stapleton, Underwood, Lambert, Musgraves kinda Country, aka white people’s interpretation of Country music. At least that’s what I got from it.
