This year's Jingle Bell Ball with Barclaycard, hosted by Capital Radio, has finally released its full line-up - and it's a big one.
The annual event, which is held at London's O2 Arena, has just confirmed Coldplay as the headliner for their first night, Saturday, December 7, 2024. Coldplay's headline performance news is incredibly exciting, considering they just confirmed their own monumental stadium tour will kick off next year across the UK, as well.
On top of Coldplay, this two-day gig, which is being hosted by Barclaycard, will also see some other huge names in music hit the 20,000-person venue.
Katy Perry is headlining the second night, Sunday, December 8, 2024, and she'll be joining American country music and rapper Teddy Swims, as well.Â 
They'll all be joined by Perrie, Clean Bandit, Becky Hill, Kygo, and more. The full list of performers is below, but before then we've got how to buy tickets below - here's the information you need:

Sites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs.
Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk.
With that said, viagogo also commented: "viagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee."
Tickets for Coldplay's headline stadium tour went on sale last month and mostly sold out across the board.
However, there are still plenty of tickets available right now across various resale websites.
These retailers, including viagogo, StubHub and more, allow fans to buy and sell their tickets at their leisure, at a price point they have determined.
