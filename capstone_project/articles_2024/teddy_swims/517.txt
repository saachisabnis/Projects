This past year, Benson Boone put out his debut album Fireworks & Rollerblades.  And it looks as though we won’t have to wait long for more music from the “Beautiful Things” artist.
At the star-studded Jingle Ball concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Dec. 13, Benson debuted an unreleased song called “Young American Heart,” from a new album due out in 2025. He also performed his hits “Slow It Down” and “Beautiful Things.”
Also at the event, Benson walked the red carpet wearing a “Teddy Swims” t-shirt, to shout-out his BFF, who was also performing. Teddy dressed up like Santa Claus in a red suit and hat, and even used makeup to turn his beard white as he sang “The Door,” “Lose Control,” “Bad Dream” and other songs.
You’ll be able to see these performances — as well as sets by Katy Perry, Gracie Abrams, Meghan Trainor, Shaboozey and more — when ABC airs highlights of the concert Dec. 18 at 8 p.m. ET, streaming the next day on Hulu.
