The pop star will be joined by the likes of Becky Hill and KSI at her first UK show in over six years 
The line-up for the second date of Capital’s Jingle Bell Ball 2024 has been revealed, with Katy Perry due to headline. Find all the details below.
This year’s edition of the two-night event will be held at The O2 in London on Saturday December 7 and Sunday December 8. The concerts will also be live-streamed via the official Capital app.
Yesterday (November 6), it was confirmed that Coldplay would be headlining the first show. They’ll be joined by Teddy Swims, former Little Mix member Perrie, Clean Bandit, Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan and Sigala.
This morning (November 7), the bill for night two was announced on Capital Breakfast. Perry, whose latest album ‘143’ arrived in September, will headline with her first UK performance in over six years. It’ll also mark the singer’s first Jingle Bell Ball since 2013.
“I’m so excited to be coming back to the UK, I love it!” Perry said on Capital Breakfast this morning. “[I’ll] hopefully follow that up with more [shows].”
As for what fans can expect from next month’s set, she explained: “I’m definitely gonna bring some pizzazz; I always give a little Christmas spirit to it.
“I’m gonna be bringing some new songs off of ‘143’. I’ve been doing a lot of performances that are kind of futuristic, a little sci-fi, and so everything has a little bit of that edge to it right now. I’m just gonna try and bring my light and my joy.”
