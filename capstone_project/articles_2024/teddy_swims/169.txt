MISC: FILM: PERFECT DAYS  Wim Wenders has made a number of lyrical films that, directly or indirectly, document the pursuit of happiness. An angel tumbles from heaven to gain it in Wings of Desire, an aimless woman is motivated to chase it across continents in Until the End of the World … and in his latest film, Perfect Days, a man finds it in the bathroom. Given an opportunity to make a documentary about Tokyo’s architecturally stunning public toilets, Wenders instead uses them to tell the story of Hirayama (Kōji Yakusho), a quiet, beatific man whose job is to clean them. Perfect Days looks for happiness in places most wouldn’t think to check—in old books, in cassettes of favorite songs, in the way sunlight filters through trees—and it considers the lengths we’ll go to make a peaceful life for ourselves, even if it means scrubbing the odd urinal. 4:45 p.m., $10, Beverly Theater, thebeverlytheater.com. –Geoff Carter

MUSIC: LANY A decade after releasing its self-titled LP, LANY has only gotten better with age. The Los Angeles-based duo found a niche in the indie-pop scene with a pensive catalog of forthright love lyrics and soothing basslines to boot. Drummer Jake Clifford Goss’ energetic drum work lights up tracks like “Dancing in the Kitchen,” while the melodic vocals of Paul Jason Klein drive home feelings of love lost and being lovelorn. LANY’s fifth album, A Beautiful Blur, marks the first LP without band member Les Priest, who left the band in 2022 to pursue a career as a producer, but the duo has used that opportunity to explore a louder, more drum-dominated style that’ll sound great in the Chelsea. 7:30 p.m., $36-$83, the Chelsea, ticketmaster.com. –Amber Sampson

MUSIC: THE ISLEY BROTHERS There are very few acts in any genre that have accomplished the unique feat the Isleys have: starting with the ubiquitous “Shout” in 1959 and continuing through “Contagious” in 2001, the soul-funk-R&B group-turned-duo has charted a song on the Billboard Hot 100 in six different decades. As impressive as that may be, it only begins to explain the Isleys’ remarkable impact and influence on generations of hip-hop and R&B artists, evident via countless samples (“Footsteps in the Dark” is Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day”) and covers (Aaliyah’s unforgettable version of “At Your Best”). From gospel to original rock and roll to Motown to quiet storm, only the Isleys have conquered so consistently. And the singular voice of 82-year-old Ronald and all-around musicianship of 72-year-old Ernie are still on display today, though not onstage as frequently as we’d like. Fortunately, Vegas is the place for legacy acts, and what a legacy. 8 p.m., $63-$210+, Pearl Concert Theater, ticketmaster.com. –Brock Radke

MUSIC: BUCKETS Buckets embodies the best elements of modern indie rock—fluctuating guitar riffage, hooking verse work, lo-fi tinted vocals and an electrifying onstage presence. Formed in 2021, Tanner Houghton, Sasha Massey, Mitch Rossiter and Hiram Sevilla have impressively succeeded in making noise that sounds like a declaration of self-discovery. Now on the road for their sophomore album Good Luck Bad Dog, the LA 4-piece is set to bring its emotional but still rock n’ roll sound to Griffin’s back room. Supporting the touring quartet are a couple of freshly hatched local acts, Simple Fishes and Ms. Mrs. 8 p.m., $15, the Griffin, dice.fm. –Gabriela Rodriguez

The “Save the Roach” started as a joke but became a meaningful metaphor for preserving the artist’s passion for hip-hop.
It’s not just about putting Leia in the metal bikini and calling it a day—the good-natured campiness of “Star Wars” is fully awakened.
