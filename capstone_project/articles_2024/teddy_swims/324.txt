The 'Beautiful Things' singer also teased that fans should "get ready for the new album"
Fans have been reacting to Benson Boone pulling off one of his trademark overhead flips during his performance at the 2024 MTV EMAs.
The singer was one of the early performers at the awards ceremony at Manchester’s Co-op Live Arena on Sunday night (November 10), where he performed his smash hit single ‘Beautiful Things’, which is nominated in the Best Song category.
Boone’s performance began with him descending from the ceiling while playing the piano, and culminated in him leaping acrobatically from a platform in an overhead flip and landing on his feet.

As the EMAs account said on X, “I’m a completely different person than I was 2 seconds ago after watching Benson Boone flip on the MTV EMAs stage”.

Another X user chimed in that Boone “flipped my world upside down” with his performance, while another compared his piano descent to Lady Gaga’s dramatic opening at the 2017 Super Bowl Halftime Show where she pulled off a similar stunt.
Same, @bensonboone just *flipped* my world upside down! 😱🔥 #MTVEMA

Boone later accepted the award for ‘Best New’ at the ceremony, and in his acceptance speech, he teased fans with news of his new album, telling them to “get ready”.

“Thank you so much, I was extremely unprepared for this, but I would say I have not been doing music a crazy long time, I didn’t know this is where my life would go. And a couple of years ago, I found my voice and I found my passion and my career, and honestly there has been one person that every single day has been by my side with everything I have done, and that is my manager Jeff Burns. This is for Jeff, thank you so much Jeff, I love you.”
“Thank you guys for changing my life, I promise you I will be giving it all back to you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Get ready for the new album.”
Boone’s debut album ‘Fireworks & Rollerblades’ was released in April this year via Night Street and Warner Records and included ‘Beautiful Things’ as well as its follow-up singles ‘Slow It Down’ and ‘Pretty Slowly’.
The MTV EMAs were hosted by Rita Ora for a record-breaking third time, and aside from Boone, it also featured live performances from RAYE, Shawn Mendes, Teddy Swims, The Warning, LE SSERAFIM, Peso Pluma, Tyla, Busta Rhymes and Pet Shop Boys.
