Kacey Musgraves proved that she only needs her voice and an acoustic guitar to captivate a crowd at the 2024 CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.
Every eye in the room was on the country star as she performed "The Architect," from her 2024 album Deeper Well, which in addition to earning nominations for the 2024 CMA Awards received several Grammy nods as well.
Wearing a gorgeous white dress and sitting on a patchwork quilt as lights floated all around her on stage, Musgraves performed a mesmerizing rendition of her striking song begging to speak to the divine force, deity, or who or whatever is responsible for creating everything in the world, if that force even exists.
Musgraves, who previously shared which lyric she has "always felt bad about" and why, also recently hilariously reacted to a photo from her childhood capturing a memory that she still feels "pretty bitter" about.
Hosted by returning duo Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning as well as newcomer Lainey Wilson to round out the superstar trio, the 58th CMA Awards featured performances from artists like Wilson, Kelsea Ballerini, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs, Post Malone, Eric Church, Thomas Rhett, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey, Ashley McBryde and many more.
Don't miss out on seeing who took home awards during the big night, including George Strait, who was honored with the 2024 Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award as well as an unforgettable star-powered tribute.
