ON 'DEDICATION NIGHT,' OCT. 15
 
Three-Time Mirrorball Champion Mark Ballas 
Returns to the Ballroom as Guest Judge

  
"Dedication Night" - The nine remaining couples take to the ballroom floor to honor influential figures/institutions in their lives through heartfelt performances. Special guest judge Mark Ballas lends his expertise, then Derek and Hayley Hough celebrate her triumphant return to the ballroom with a moving routine to "Beautiful Things (Acoustic)" by Benson Boone. "Dedication Night" premieres TUESDAY, OCT. 15 (8:00-10:01 p.m. EDT/PDT, 7:00-9:01 p.m. CDT), simulcasting LIVE across both ABC and Disney+ in local time zones and next day on Hulu. 

This week, judges will visit the couples during rehearsals to assess their progress as we near the halfway point in the competition and offer feedback on how they can improve to enhance their chances of winning the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy. Partner dances will include the Contemporary, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Salsa, Argentine Tango and Foxtrot.

Fans will be able to vote during the live simulcast of the show in the ET/CT time zones.
