You know him for his songs "Lose Control" and "The Door".  He has one of the most distinct, iconic voices of 2024 and blends genres together like it's a piece of cake.  Now, he's performing at the Hard Rock Casino Rockford on Friday, September 20th!
On Facebook, the Hard Rock Casino in Rockford announced many artists performing on Labor Day weekend for the grand opening; AKON, Brad Paisley, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, and many more.
Now, a new show has been added in September!  Teddy Swims will perform on Friday, September 20th at 7pm.  Are you ready, Rockford?!
The presale already sold out, which isn't surprising!  Tickets to the general public go on sale on Friday, August 23rd at 10am.
To attend, you have to be 21+.  Doors open at 7pm, show starts at 8pm.
Over the past year, so many new artists have emerged online; on TikTok, Instagram, SoundCloud, and YouTube - Teddy Swims being one of them.  An artist on the rise.
With the temporary Casino officially closed, the giant Rick Nielsen guitar standing 62' 10" tall in front of the Hard Rock Casino Rockford, and just days away from opening day, we can't wait any longer!
I need to meet this man.  He is one of the very few artists I appreciate for their natural, organic talent and unique voice.  He seems really humble and kind from following him on social media, too,  Teddy, if you see this, let's make this happen!
