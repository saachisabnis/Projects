Linkin Park announced on Instagram on Wednesday (December 11) that they have been added to the roster of performers taking part in Thursday’s 2024 Billboard Music Awards. “From a sold-out stadium in Brazil 🇧🇷 to the Billboard Music Awards,” the band captioned their post. Linkin Park joins Coldplay as the only rock bands set to perform at this year’s BBMAs. The beloved band announced their reunion earlier this year, seven years after the death of vocalist Chester Bennington in 2017. In November, Linkin Park released their eighth studio album, From Zero, which features new vocalist Emily Armstrong and drummer Colin Brittain, who replaced co-founder Rob Bourdon. 
In addition to Coldplay and Linkin Park, the other previously announced performers at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards include country stars Jelly Roll, Megan Moroney, and Shaboozey, K-pop stars SEVENTEEN and Stray Kids, soul singer Teddy Swims, South African singer Tyla, and Mexican band Fuerza Regida. The BBMAs will air on Thursday (December 12) at 8 p.m. ET on Fox. (Billboard)
