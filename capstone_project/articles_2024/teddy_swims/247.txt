Emily Ratajkowski joined Shaboozey at the Z100 Summer Bash in New York on Thursday evening (August 8) amid rumors that the two are dating.
Shaboozey performed at the free show alongside Alex Warren, Mark Ambor, BIA and Teddy Swims in the lineup. Ratajkowski was spotted watching the “A Bar Song (Tispy)” hitmaker’s performance at Hudson Yards. The pair were also together backstage. Shaboozey’s latest performance arrives as the Virginia-born artist marks a powerful 2024, including appearing on Beyoncé’s hotly-anticipated, country-themed album, COWBOY CARTER, earlier this year. He released his own full-length album, Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going, in May. Most recently, Shaboozey delivered “Drink Don’t Need No Mix.”
Dating rumors have been swirling as Ratajkowski, 33, and Shaboozey, 29, have reportedly been spotted together, including at a nightclub in New York City. However, neither the model and actress nor the singer-songwriter has commented publicly on speculation of a budding romance as of publication time on Friday morning (August 9).
Shaboozey is one of many artists taking the stage at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival, returning to the T-Mobile Arena stage on September 20 and 21 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Other artists in the genre-spanning lineup include Big Sean, Camila Cabello, Doja Cat, Gwen Stefani, Hozier, Keith Urban, New Kids on the Block, Paramore, Thomas Rhett, The Black Crowes, Victoria Monét, and more. Ryan Seacrest will host the two-day festival. Tickets are available to the general public now on AXS.com.
