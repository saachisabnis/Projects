Jack Harlow's “Lovin On Me” remains at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking its third total week on top. That ties “First Class” for his longest run at No. 1. Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” held steady at No. 2 (following its four non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 that started in October.) Tate McRae’s first top 10 single, “Greedy,” landed at No. 3 this week, just ahead of Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, which rose to No. 5. Doja Cat’s “Paint the Town Red” rounded out the top 5 this week. SZA’s “Snooze” stays at No. 6, Tyla’s “Water,” is steady at No. 7, and Teddy Swims enters the top 10 for the first time as “Lose Control” lands at No. 8. Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills” is No. 9 and Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” wraps up the top 10.
