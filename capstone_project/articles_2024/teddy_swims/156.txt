Concerned neighbors came out in force last night to review the proposal by developer Braddock & Logan to build 34 homes on a 12.6 acre plot that borders the end of 26th Avenue. The land is currently open space - a steep hillside with trees and a valley - located west of the Peninsula golf course and south of Highway 92. The 40-plus residents who crammed into a small room in San Mateo City Hall last night were concerned with one thing and one thing only - will there be access to and from 26th Avenue to the new development?
"Every time a development comes up they want to access 26th Avenue, everyone here is here for one reason. You could say three words and everyone would leave," said area resident Gene McCralken. "We want you to tell us you won't use 26th."
But the developer cannot make that promise at this point. Braddock & Logan was just informed about a week ago by the San Mateo Fire Department that there needs to be a second access point besides the one the company originally drew in the plans.
"We haven't even had time for our engineers to look at it," said Jim Sullivan, project manager for the company. "If there is an access point [at 26th Avenue] it will not be for everyone, it will be a locked gate for emergency use only."
