Within hours of its release, the response to “FIGHTER,” by Breitbart’s own singer/songwriter Jon Kahn, is undeniable as the emotional song has rocketed up the iTunes pop charts into the number 4 slot.
The anthem has cracked the top 10 in all genres on iTunes, currently positioned at number 10.
“FIGHTER” takes a spot on the iTunes charts between Lady Gaga and Teddy Swims. Earlier, Kahn told Breitbart News, “If he can take a bullet, I can write a song. Everybody should find their own method of fighting for what they believe in particularly in times like these.”

Released by Nashville label Baste Records, “FIGHTER” is accompanied by a stirring black and white video portrait of a man that shows not only his resilience and fight but also love.
WATCH:
Co-written by veteran hitmaker, Chris Wallin, who’s written songs for the likes of Garth Brooks, Kenny Chesney, Toby Keith, and Trace Adkins to name a few, the anthem is a musical character study of a man who never gives up no matter what he’s facing.
“FIGHTER”
I’ve been down
 Counted out
 Smiling through the taste of blood
 In my own mouth
I got bruises
 Broken bones
 But they don’t know
 I ain’t in this ring alone
I’m a fighter
 No one can say that I’m a run and hider
 I was born to be a do or die-er
 A make it righter
 Don’t throw that towel just yet
 Don’t cash in that last bet
 Cause I hit harder when I’m tired
 I’m a fighter
I get back up
 That’s what I do
 I didn’t soldier on this far just to lose
So take your shot
 Is that all you got?
I’m a fighter
 No one can say that I’m a run and hider
 I was born to be a do or die-er
 A make it righter
 Don’t throw that towel just yet
 Don’t cash in that last bet
 Cause I hit harder when I’m tired
 I’m a fighter
No one can keep me down
 They didn’t know but they know now
That I’m a fighter
 No one can say that I’m a run and hider
 Don’t cash in that last bet
 Don’t throw that towel just yet
 I’m a fighter
