	2024 has undeniably been the year of Sabrina Carpenter on the U.K. charts. With “Taste” holding steady at the top, Carpenter has collectively spent 17 weeks at No. 1 this year alone, thanks to earlier smashes like “Espresso” (which dominated for seven weeks) and “Please Please Please” (which ruled for five).

	But the race isn’t over yet—Chappell Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!” is creeping up fast, now sitting at No. 2 and just 2,300 chart units behind.

	But wait, there’s more – The Weeknd is also coming in hot with his latest collab with Playboi Carti. Their track “Timeless” made an explosive debut at No. 3 and eyeing a spot in the upper echelon. It’s a strong start for this new release, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see a chart shakeup next week.

	As mentioned, Sabrina’s other hits are still hanging strong. “Espresso” proves it’s still brewing strong as it holds steady at No. 4, and “Please Please Please” remains at No. 6, making it clear she’s having a banner year. Carpenter’s chart reign is far from over, but with strong competition from Roan and The Weeknd, we’ll see if she can keep the momentum going.

	Elsewhere on the chart, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars are on the rise, with their duet “Die With a Smile” climbing from No. 6 to No. 4. And speaking of rising stars, Chappell Roan’s “Hot to Go” has cracked the Top 10 for the first time, jumping two spots from No. 12 to No. 10.

	Teddy Swims is on the brink of his first Top 10 breakthrough as “The Door” edges up to No. 11, just one spot away from making it into the coveted top tier. Coldplay, too, are making moves— “feelslikeimfallinginlove” has shot up 13 places to land at No. 18, thanks in part to their upcoming U.K. tour.

	Stay tuned to see how the U.K. Official Singles Chart unfolds this Friday.
