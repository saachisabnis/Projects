Coldplay have been announced as live performers during the upcoming 2024 Billboard Music Awards. The chart-topping British band will be making their performance debut at the BBMAs, with their segment shot during a sold-out show on their record-setting, Music of the Spheres Tour, in Australia. Coldplay will be performing selections from their new album, Moon Music, which recently became the groups fifth No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart, and their first in over ten years. Coldplay joins previously announced performers SEVENTEEN, Teddy Swims, and Tyla, who are all set to play during the awards show, with many of them performing on location. SEVENTEEN will perform from the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the Santa Monica Pier, while Tyla will be playing in a London pub. The 2024 Billboard Music Awards will be hosted by actress and comedian Michelle Buteau, and  is set to air on Thursday, December 12, at 8 pm ET on Fox. (Billboard)
