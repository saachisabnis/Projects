The 2024 Democratic National Convention roll call was literal political theater. While the process is nominally about the states bequeathing their delegates to Kamala Harris, it turned out it was really about creating the best vibe. All 50 states’ best and brightest Democrats attempted to outdo one another on matters of energy, state pride, patriotism, and sometimes even political views through song choices that represent their state. If the theme of the Democrats right now is “good vibes only,” then the states were in a heated competition. But the truth is that not all energies were created equal. Some aimed for “brat-summer joy” and ended up with “girl, so confusing.” Below, the Democratic state roll call song choices ranked by how well they put the d-a-n-c-e in DNC.
50. New Hampshire — “Don’t Stop Believin’” by JourneyJourney has nothing to do with New Hampshire, and the song choice is terminally basic. If they wanted the best song by a New Hampshirite, they should have picked Adam Sandler’s “The Chanukah Song.”
49. Nebraska — “Firework” by Katy PerryAgain, an obvious choice that doesn’t tell us anything about the state. Where’s the creativity?
48. Maine — “Shut Up and Dance” by Walk the MoonThe DNC is not the concert of an all-boys a cappella group in 2017, which means that “Shut Up and Dance” should not be played there. Also, this band isn’t even from Maine. Get it together, New England.
47. Delaware — “Higher Love” by Kygo & Whitney HoustonThis was chosen by Delaware as a nod to President Biden, who used the song in his campaign. But this roll call is supposed to be about around Kamala Harris.
46. South Dakota — “What I Like About You” by the RomanticsThe Romantics are from Detroit. Still, great track.
45. Maryland — “Respect” by Aretha FranklinFranklin was born in Tennessee and raised in Detroit. But what are we gonna do? Get mad about hearing Aretha Franklin?
44. Connecticut — “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” by Stevie WonderThis track was a hallmark of the Obama campaign, but Wonder is from Michigan.
43. Michigan — “Lose Yourself” by EminemMaryland and Connecticut prove Michigan has some great artists. When picking from their own artists, they went with … Eminem. All right! Glad to see you guys representing a hometown hero, but did we really need a song with the word lose in it?
42. Alabama — “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd SkynyrdNothing wrong with an obvious choice.
41. Kansas — “Carry on My Wayward Son” by KansasWell, yeah.
40. New York — “Empire State of Mind” by Jay-Z and Alicia KeysOf course.
39. New Jersey — “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce SpringsteenHad to.
38. North Dakota — “Girl on Fire” by Alicia KeysA choice so random that we have to applaud it.
37. Montana — “American Woman” by Lenny KravitzYes, it has the word American in the title, but we were still shocked that this track made the cut for Montana.
36. Wyoming — “I Gotta Feeling” by the Black Eyed PeasWyoming loves bar mitzvah music, apparently. And why shouldn’t they? It’s Obamacore.
35. Iowa — “Celebration” by Kool & the GangKool & the Gang is from New Jersey, but Iowa correctly identified the eternal truth that “Celebration” must be played at every event.
34. Kentucky — “First Class” by Jack HarlowMost states picked a song by someone from their state to support local talent. Does Harlow need it, though?
33. Utah — “Animal” by Neon TreesWhere did this indie-adjacent early-2010s vibe come from?
32. Alaska — “Feel It Still” by Portugal. The ManSee above blurb.
31. Nevada — “Mr. Brightside” by the KillersGreat song that everybody loves, but there’s no element of surprise here.
30. Rhode Island — “Shake It Off” by Taylor SwiftSwift is not so much “from” Rhode Island as much as she is “a person who owns a house in Rhode Island.”
29. New Mexico — “Confident” by Demi LovatoNothing wrong with being confident.
28. Washington — “Can’t Hold Us” by Macklemore and Ryan LewisOur long national nightmare of pretending this song isn’t a banger is over.
27. Vermont — “Stick Season” by Noah KahanVery funny to have a song with the line “I’m mean because I grew up in New England” represent your state on the national stage.
26. North Carolina — “Raise Up” by Petey PabloShoulda been “Freek-a-Leek.”
25. Hawaii — “24K Magic” by Bruno MarsGreat song, no notes.
24. Ohio — “Green Light” by John Legend featuring Andre 3000Props to Ohio for the one Legend song that absolutely bangs.
23. Florida — “I Won’t Back Down” by Tom PettyGood message! Very direct!
22. Oregon — “Float On” by Modest MouseOn brand for Oregon to show off true hipster bona fides. See, Utah and Alaska?
21. Virginia — “The Way I Are” by Timbaland featuring Keri Hilson and D.O.E.Love this song.
20. Oklahoma — “Ain’t Goin’ Down (’Til the Sun Comes Up)” by Garth BrooksAlways worth flexing to the rest of the country-music-listening public that you have Brooks.
19. Mississippi — “Twistin’ the Night Away” by Sam CookeA classic for a reason.
18. Indiana — “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough” by Michael JacksonLook, the man knew how to write a pump-up anthem.
17. Colorado — “September” by Earth, Wind & FireWho is mad at listening to this song? Nobody.
16. Louisiana — “All I Do Is Win” by DJ KhaledThis song will go down in history books as one of the all-time great celebratory tracks. Mark our words.
15. Arizona — “Edge of Seventeen” by Stevie Nicks JUST LIKE THE WHITE WINGED DOVE SINGS A SONG, SOUNDS LIKE SHE’S SINGIN’.
14. Missouri — “Good Luck, Babe” by Chappell RoanIf we had recently birthed the greatest pop-success story of the year, we’d feel like bragging too. Missouri will be holding onto this one for decades to come.
13. South Carolina — “Get Up, I Feel Like Being a Sex Machine” by James Brown Absolutely remarkable vibes to get a song this dirty and funky into the DNC.
12. Wisconsin — “Jump Around” by House of PainTwo states just opted to use songs that their teams play at sporting events. Smart move! They play this track at University of Wisconsin football games, and it’s clear that those Badgers have a grand time.
11. Illinois — “Sirius” by the Alan Parsons ProjectThis was the Bulls walk-on music and, honestly, try listening to this song without feeling like you need to go get something done. It’s like Adderall for the ears.
10. Idaho — “My Own Private Idaho” by the B-52’sThe B-52’s are not in any way associated with Idaho, but they did include the state in one of their titles. Either way, thrilled to see them represented here. The Democrats should make “Rock Lobster” their next campaign song.
9. West Virginia — “Take Me Home, Country Road” by John DenverOne of the themes of Harris’s campaign is taking back patriotism for the left. Well, if there’s one song that everybody should be fighting for in the custody battle, it’s this one.
8. Arkansas — “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood MacThis was chosen as an homage to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign song. Nice to see them honoring history, but more important, we get why he chose it. This song rules.
7. Pennsylvania — “Motownphilly” by Boyz II Men; “Black and Yellow” by Wiz KhalifaFour states opted to pick multiple songs, a flex of power. We love that PA went with one Philadelphia track and one Pittsburgh track — unite that state!
﻿6. Massachusetts — “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” by the Dropkick MurphysThis song is an amazing pump-up anthem, and it reminds us of The Departed.
5. Texas — “Texas Hold ’Em” by BeyoncéPretty obvious to pick the only No. 1 hit this year with your state in the title. Still, Bey’s from Texas, so we love the hometown shout-out, and Harris has been using Beyoncé’s “Freedom” as her campaign song, so there’s a nice synergy.
4. Minnesota — “Kiss” by Prince & the Revolution;“1999” by Prince & the RevolutionPerhaps no state, at the moment, has better vibes than Minnesota after being thrust into the spotlight via Coach Walz. They kicked their feet up and enjoyed their time in the sun, picking not one but two Prince songs to play. Good for them!
﻿3. California — “The Next Episode” by Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg;“California Love” by Tupac Shakur featuring Dr. Dre; “Alright” and “Not Like Us” by Kendrick LamarHarris’s home state basked in the glory, picking four songs. “Not Like Us” put their playlist over the edge, basically declaring war on Canada at the DNC. We hope they aren’t offended.
2. Tennessee — “9 to 5” by Dolly PartonNobody unites America like Parton, the one universally beloved figure left in this country. Hearing the instrumental of “9 to 5” come on is like hearing the most beautiful bird wake you up peacefully and patriotically in the morn.
1. Georgia — “Turn Down for What” by DJ Snake and Lil Jon; “Get Low” by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz featuring Ying Yang Twins Look, Georgia was the only state with Lil Jon. Bonkers, but the vibes were right. Having him there, performing one of the most propulsive songs to come out this century, was stupid, funny, exciting, and got people talking. “To the windows, to the Walz” is going on T-shirts and in history books.
