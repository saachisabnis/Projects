Rumors have been swirling regarding Bruno Mars and a reported $50 million gambling debt owed to MGM Resorts International. The speculation gained traction last week, raising questions about the Grammy-winning artist’s financial status in relation to his multi-year residency agreement with the renowned Las Vegas casino.
According to insider accounts cited by NewsNation, Bruno, known for hits like “Locked Out of Heaven,” allegedly found himself in a substantial debt of $50 million due to his gambling activities at the MGM casino. Reports suggested that despite his lucrative deal with the establishment, which purportedly earns him $90 million annually, Bruno’s hefty gambling losses leave him with a net income of only $1.5 million per show after taxes.
However, on Monday (March 18), MGM Resorts International released an official statement addressing these claims and vehemently refuting any notion of Bruno Mars being indebted to the company.
In their statement provided to Complex, MGM emphasized their longstanding partnership with Bruno Mars, highlighting his immense talent and the widespread appeal of his performances at venues like Dolby Live at Park MGM and the newly inaugurated Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio. The company expressed pride in their collaboration with Bruno, describing him as one of the world’s most captivating entertainers.
Crucially, MGM categorically dismissed the speculation surrounding Bruno’s alleged gambling debt, asserting that he holds no financial obligations to the company. The statement underscored the mutual respect and successful synergy between Bruno Mars and MGM Resorts International, emphasizing their collective commitment to delivering unparalleled entertainment experiences for visitors from across the globe.
With Bruno Mars’s star continuing to shine brightly, undeterred by unfounded speculation, his partnership with MGM remains an enduring testament to the power of collaboration in the world of entertainment.
