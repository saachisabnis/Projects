The surprise appearance follows from their historic performance at Glastonbury last night (June 28)
SEVENTEEN have been spotted performing covers of Adele, Bruno Mars and more at a restaurant in Bath – watch fan-filmed footage down below.
The 13-piece boyband made the surprise appearance at Square Grill in the city centre, fresh off the backs of their historic Glastonbury debut. SEVENTEEN became the first K-pop act to perform at the festival ever as they took to the Pyramid Stage yesterday (June 28).
But it appears the boys weren’t done performing just yet. They stopped by the restaurant in Bath, where member Woozi opted to step into the restaurant’s live music corner. Accompanied by a pianist, he took on vocal duty for Mars’ ‘When I Was Your Man’, and Michael Jackson’s ‘Man In The Mirror’, whilst Seungkwan sang his rendition of Calum Scott‘s ‘You Are The Reason’ and Adele staple ‘Someone Like You’.
Fans have since reacted to the news on social media, expressing shock and amusement. One posted a series of crying emojis, commenting that it was the “restaurant I went to for my graduation meal”, whilst another simply wrote: “These middle-aged women don’t know what just happened to them”.
Check out SEVENTEEN’s covers and a number of fan reactions below:

In a five-star review of SEVENTEEN’s Glastonbury debut, NME wrote: “Earlier in the afternoon, when Glastonbury is still just getting acquainted with SEVENTEEN, Joshua makes a sage point. “Language isn’t a barrier,” he tells the crowd. “We can connect through song.”
“That’s something the group demonstrate throughout their time on the Pyramid, but perhaps no stronger than in the final two numbers. ‘God Of Music’ has the crowd chanting the hook, drawing out the anthemic joy that courses through the track.”
“‘Very Nice’, meanwhile, brings a playful and utterly exuberant close to proceedings, the boyband bringing their tradition of delivering repeated, energetic reprises of the chorus to the festival as they whip up the audience one last time. As SEVENTEEN say thank you in both Korean and English, they launch into one final round of the infectious refrain, their mark well and truly made on one of the biggest festivals in the world.”
NME spoke to the boyband about their Glastonbury debut, with Seungkwan calling it “such an honour, we’re super grateful. Some of the audience members might not know us that well, but we just hope that everyone would leave with the impression that these guys can really smash it on stage.”
