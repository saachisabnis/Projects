T-shirts, hats, jerseys, jackets and all things Clippers are now available at the team’s first flagship store at its new Inglewood home.
The Clippers’ first team-owned retail store, called Flagship, at the Intuit Dome Plaza, opened to some fans on Friday, Aug. 2.
“The Flagship” will see its first potential influx of shoppers as part of the opening of the Clippers’ new stadium, the Intuit Dome, which will host its first event, a concert by pop star Bruno Mars on Aug. 15, before the Clippers begin the 2024-25 season in October.
This will mark the first time the Clippers have had their own team store, according to Claudia Calderon, chief marketing officer for the Clippers and Intuit Dome.
In previous years, the Clippers had shared a home with the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown L.A.
The Flagship store will feature a “hat wall” and a “Creation Station,” which allows fans to customize jerseys and hats, Calderon said, as well as a basketball laser engraver.

The Flagship will opened Friday for “Chuckmark Certified” fans only. Hours on Saturday and Sunday will be from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. — and will be open for the general public.
