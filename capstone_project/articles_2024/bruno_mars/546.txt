	MGM Resorts International has denied reports that Bruno Mars is in debt with the entertainment company.

	A previous report by NewsNation indicated that the “24K Magic” singer racked up a debt of more than $50 million at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas since signing a long-term residency contract with the company in 2016.

	In a statement sent to Billboard, MGM said: “We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers. From his shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM to the new Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio, Bruno’s brand of entertainment attracts visitors from around the globe. MGM and Bruno’s partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect.”
