Amy Dowden has sent a heartfelt message to her Strictly Come Dancing partner JB Gill and stand-in Lauren Oakley ahead of tonight's performance. "Wishing these two the absolute best of luck tonight! I'm going to be your biggest cheerleader!" Amy said.
Speaking directly to JB, she gushed: "JB it says everything how you've been able to adapt to a new professional, produce such a great number (so excited for everyone to see) whilst supporting me! I'm so lucky! You're a STAR! I know what tonight means to you! Thank you! " She also had kind words for fellow pro dancer Lauren, who is stepping in for her tonight: "Thank you, I knew Jay would be in safe hands and have a fabulous time with you! You know I've always adored your dancing since I ran up to you in Blackpool tower at 8 years old to tell you! Thank you darling!" 
Amy also thanked the Strictly choreographers for "such a brilliant routine! LOVE IT! Thank you! Also a big thank you for all the love and support I've received this past week. So grateful and certainly helped! Now tune into the first ever ICONS week on strictly! " This comes after Amy made a surprise appearance on It Takes Two on Friday night to discuss her recent health scare.
Strictly sensation Amy Dowden had to skip Sunday's result show last week following a health scare that led to her precautionary hospitalisation from the BBC One show's set in Elstree Studios after she started "feeling unwell". The beloved dancer made an appearance on BBC's It Takes Two alongside her dance partner JB and Lauren Oakley on Friday, where she reassured fans, saying "I'm feeling so much better and I'd just like to thank everyone for all the love and support I've received and to my Strictly family – feeling much better."
JB and Lauren are prepped for a special Bruno Mars-themed couple's choice dance on Saturday night. Overflowing with appreciation, Amy expressed how proud she was, especially of Lauren saying, "They've worked so hard, and JB's just been so supportive of me and just knuckled down."
 Constant updates through "videos and messages" kept Amy in the loop in a WhatsApp group affectionately named "Team" complete with a star emoji, reports the Mirror. 
With anticipation high, a BBC spokesperson previously said: "We are all hopeful that Amy will be back to dance with JB next week."
Triumphantly returning to the competition this series post treatment for breast cancer, which included a mastectomy and chemotherapy, Amy's spirit remains unshakeable.
Amy discovered a lump in her breast while on her Maldives honeymoon with fellow pro dancer Ben Jones. After being hit with a stage three breast cancer diagnosis and undergoing treatment, by February the uplifting news was delivered: her tests indicated "no evidence of disease".
Drawing inspiration from the impact made by her documentary about living with Crohn’s disease – which allowed her to "accept" her condition for the very "first time ever" – Amy has been an open book regarding her health challenges. The BBC show Strictly Amy: Crohn's And Me saw her candidly exploring her own battle with this lifelong illness, meeting others who share the same struggles, and sharing the realities of symptoms such as stomach pains, fatigue, and diarrhoea as noted on the NHS website.
In one episode during the 2022 Strictly live tour, Amy's Crohn's condition flared up considerably, leading to her hospitalisation in Manchester.
