	Rosé shouted out the Disney classic Tangled as she wolfed down spicy chicken wings during her appearance on Hot Ones this week, calling the film her favorite Disney flick.

	“I’m obsessed with that movie, I cried on my 20th rewatch,” she told Hot Ones host Sean Evans after he asked what her favorite song in the Disney canon is. “When Flynn Rider is about to die, he says ‘You are my new dream.’ I cried so much. My favorite [Disney] song is all the songs from that movie.”

	Elsewhere, just before eating the hottest wing in the gauntlet, the Blackpink singer jokingly gave a tearful goodbye to her dog Hank and to her fans in case the spiciness killed her. “Hank, I love you so much, I hope I survive this, but if I don’t ever see you again, I love you, just know that,” she said. “And to my Number Ones, I hope you like the album.”

	Rosé came on the show to plug her single “APT,” with Bruno Mars, and her album Rosie, which comes out Dec. 6. “APT” itself was inspired by a Korean drinking game.

	“It’s one of many Korean drinking games, but that seemed to be the one all my friends in the studio were vibing to,” she said. “It inspired me to write a song on this because they were so addicted to it. I was really lucky to have Bruno jump on it, craziest experience of my life.”
