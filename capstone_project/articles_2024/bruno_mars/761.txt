Lady Gaga has her fans "SHAKING."
The 38-year-old pop star has not released an album since the chart-topping Chromatica in 2020, but revealed on Sept. 3 (Tuesday), with a picture of her schedule for October, that a new single is imminent.
"XX October: LG7 first single," the post read on Instagram.
The "Poker Face" singer recently made a surprise return to the music industry in the weeks after she performed at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics as she teamed up with Bruno Mars to release their ballad, "Die With a Smile."
"Watching fans from all over the world celebrate this music has meant so much to me, to see the words of the song touch your heart and the video provoke this huge wave of dancing and fun is beautiful to watch and I’m so grateful," the pop icon wrote on Instagram.
“Thank you thank you thank you for loving our song I love you for real and I hope the message of love we shared will continue to create special moments for you all in your lives – I know it does in mine every day. The power of music is big and your love of this song reminded me of that," she added.
Lady Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, plays Harley Quinn alongside Joaquin Phoenix in their upcoming film Joker: Folie à Deux.
