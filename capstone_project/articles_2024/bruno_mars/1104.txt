Miley Cyrus recently responded to a lawsuit accusing her of plagiarizing Bruno Mars' "When I Was Your Man" to create her Grammy-winning hit single "Flowers."
According to Entertainment Weekly, Cyrus "denied allegations of copyright infringement" and her legal team argued that an expert would need to review the two songs before an official ruling was made. 
Tempo Music Investments, who own a share of copyright in Bruno Mars' 2013 chart-topper, took legal action against Cyrus in September 2024, referring to 2023's "Flowers" as an "unauthorized reproduction" of "When I Was Your Man." 
"It is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that 'Flowers' would not exist without 'When I Was Your Man.'" The company proceeded to list the similarities between the two singles, created 12 years apart, in official court documents comparing the tracks lyrically and melodically.
"...the opening vocal line from the chorus of 'Flowers' begins and ends on the same chords as the opening vocal line in the verse of 'When I Was Your Man.'"
Mars was not named as a plaintiff in the legal documents and has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.
