July 18 has now been declared Carrie Underwood Day in Hawaii by Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi and James Tokioka, Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism Director, on behalf of Governor Josh Green.
The proclamations were issued to Underwood on the eve of her first performances in Hawaii on July 19–20 in recognition of her career achievements as well as her significant cultural and societal contributions. This marks the first time ceremonial proclamations have been issued concurrently by the state of Hawaii and the city and county of Honolulu to honor an entertainer.
“History has been made with Carrie becoming the first artist to receive ceremonial proclamations from both the state and city,” says concert promoter Rick Bartalini. “She is in prestigious company of entertainers that have been previously honored by either the Mayor or the Governor in this manner, including Elvis Presley, Janet Jackson, Bruno Mars and Diana Ross.”
Both proclamations were presented to Underwood during an official ceremony at the Blaisdell Arena. The proclamation presented by Mayor Blangiardi stated in part, “With heartfelt aloha, we thank her for bringing her live show to Hawaii, and fulfilling the dreams of thousands of fans who have eagerly awaited this opportunity. Carrie Underwood embodies the Aloha Spirit through her talent, love and genuine care and compassion for others.”
