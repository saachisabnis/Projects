Little Monsters are getting closer to LG7, because Lady Gaga, Mother Monster herself, has announced her new single, "Disease," and it's coming SO SOON!
On Instagram, Lady G shared the "Disease" cover art, which shows bird's eye view of the singer bent over on top of a white car, with "Disease" written backwards. Fans also have a clue of what to expect from the song as Gaga has appeared to post some of the track's lyrics on GagaDisease.com, reading, "I could play the doctor."
"Disease" is set to be released worldwide on Friday, October 25th.
Lady Gaga first teased a new single was coming this month, as she shared a picture of her itinerary from early September, while she was in Venice, Italy to a premiere for Joker: Folie à Deux. At the very end of the typed itinerary, following "04 October: Folie à Deux in theaters," read, "XX October: LG7 first single." And now, we're here!
"Disease" is the first taste of the highly-anticipated LG7 album, and follows the release of Gaga's Folie à Deux album, Harlequin, which features 13 new songs inspired by the film. The new single also follows the release of her collaboration with Bruno Mars, "Die With A Smile," which she has confirmed will not appear on LG7.
