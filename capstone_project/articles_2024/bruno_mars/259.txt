A source allegedly told the outlet: “[MGM] basically own him. He makes $90 million a year off of the deal he did with the casino, but then he has to pay back his debt.”
Bruno Mars has allegedly been an avid gambler since his teenage years and once spoke about his early days playing cards: “I used to be like a loudmouth. You know the guy, people would want to take his money. If you do get them to lose, they’re out for you, they’re gunning for you,” Mars said at the time. “And that’s when they’re weak. And that’s when you jump or pounce on them.”

He also claimed that he was 19 the first time he visited a casino: “I remember my first bet, my hand was shaking, and a guy called me out on it and embarrassed me. You gotta lose. You just have to lose to win, to understand.”
The acclaimed singer has had a residency at Park MGM since 2016 which was recently extended well into 2024.
