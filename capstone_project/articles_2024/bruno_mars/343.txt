	Most recently, “Die With a Smile” was nominated for song of the year and best pop duo/group performance at the 2025 Grammy Awards.

	As the song continues to maintain momentum, Gaga has been promoting her upcoming seventh album, arriving in February. Last month, she released its lead single “Disease,” a darkly-shaded pop tune with a horror-adjacent music video to match. Prior to that, she put out her album “Harlequin” in September as a companion piece to the film “Joker: Folie à Deux,” in which she starred. The project was largely a collection of covers from the American songbook.

	Meanwhile, Mars is furthering his collaborative streak with an appearance on Rosé’s “Apt.” That song topped over 100 million streams on Spotify within its first week of release last month.
