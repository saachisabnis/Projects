As The Masked Singer continues on ITV1 and many viewers are still trying to guess which celebrities are behind the crazy costumes. Fans think they have cracked the identity of Piranha after one obscure clue.
Performing Treasure by Bruno Mars, many fans believe that Piranha is Danny Jones, from the band McFly. One very random clue has led viewers to this conclusion. In their pre-recorded tape shown before they performed, to help audiences learn more about the character, pine cones were shown as a clue. Many fans believe this points to Danny as McFly worked with actor Chris Pine in Just My Luck.

One said: "Danny from McFly. In a film Just My Luck with Chris Pine #MaskedSingerUK #piranha" and another added: "The pine cones for McFly working with Chris Pine on Just My Luck would be such a wide-stretched clue though #MaskedSinger". A third said: "I can't believe people are even still disputing if Piranha is Danny Jones or not. McFly guest starred in Just My Luck with Chris Pine, and in Casualty in 2005, and he fell over on the London Eye. Pls just take our word for it. This is what we do x #MaskedSingerUK."
And: "Surely the pine cone clue relates to Danny being in Just My Luck with Chris Pine? #MaskedSingerUK". A fifth said: "Chris Pine (cones) was in Just My Luck, which McFly did a song for. Piranha has to be Danny Jones. #MaskedSingerUK".
Aside from the pine cone clue many guessed it was Danny as they recognised his voice. Other fan guesses for Piranha have included Keith Duffy and Matt Cardle.
