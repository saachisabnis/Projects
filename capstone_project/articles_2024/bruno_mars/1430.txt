Marie and Clare are both members of the Chalkwell Redcaps. Claire works for the Essex & Herts Air ambulance. This charity costs over a £1,000,000 a month to maintain. The service receives no money apart from donations from members of the public. There are two aircraft.  in 2023 there were 2705 call outs, each costing £2,800. Marie has swum all her life. They like to swim in ‘skins’, that is no wetsuit, even in freezing temperatures! It can be very cold swimming off the Essex coast.  They decided to “follow the dream” and take part
in Swim the Arctic. It is an annual event, this year on July 13th. Starting at midnight on the Torne River in Finland, it is a two mile swim through time zones, finishing in Sweden. They decided to use participation to raise money for the Air ambulance. They described the event as a personal challenge.  Moira stated that swimming in cold water was scientifically proven to be “great for mental and physical well-being”. Their initial sponsorship target was £1,000. Already they have raised £1,700. On air we decided that a good target would be the cost of one call out, £2,800.
