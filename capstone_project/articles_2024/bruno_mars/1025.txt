The Masked Singer fans reckon they've worked out exactly who Piranha is on the ITV series after Saturday night's instalment.
Air Fryer, Bubble Tea, Owl, Piranha and Eiffel Tower were the five costumes battling it out to be saved as they took on school disco week. But as Piranha delivered another outstanding performance and gave away some huge hints, some fans are now convinced they have revealed their identity on the show, writes The Mirror.
Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross and Mo Gilligan were back on the panel this week joined by actress and comedian Jennifer Saunders, with panellist Rita Ora absent again.
Piranha took to stage to perform once more, and the clues included being different, references to the millennium and being frightened of their own shadow.
There were also clues about being on stage and some pinecones and hand soap as they then performed Treasure by Bruno Mars.
However fans at home are convinced Piranha was a musician and TV talent show coach or judge who is behind the masked. They reckon that the vocals alone pretty much gave the game away, given the singer's distinctive voice.
Fans were sure once more that it was McFly's Danny Jones performing as Piranha, with him being a coach on The Voice Kids UK. McFly appeared on British soap Hollyoaks, and in a movie with Chris Pine - hence the pinecones. They also won a Brit Award in 2005, with this year being included as a clue.
The clues and the voice led many to this decision, with one fan writing on X: "piranha is 1000000000000% @itsDannyJones," as another said: "Piranha is Danny Jones from Mcfly on the @MaskedSingerUK. He will definitely go on to win!"
Another penned: "Iâ€™m sticking with Danny from Mcfly being piranha," while one said: "piranha is a million times Danny Jones. It has to be."
It comes a week after the judges booted out the third celebrity, as Rat was unmasked as Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas.
