Update: MGM Resorts International Releases a Statement to The Source:
“We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers. From his shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM to the new Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio, Bruno’s brand of entertainment attracts visitors from around the globe. MGM and Bruno’s partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect. Any speculation otherwise is completely false; he has no debt with MGM. Together, we are excited to continue creating unforgettable experiences for our guests.”
Original Story: Even though pop sensation Bruno Mars has reached the ninth year of residency at Park MGM in Las Vegas, slated to continue throughout 2024, News Nation has reported that Mars has racked up a ridiculous gambling debt at the casino. “He owes millions to the MGM [from gambling],” an unnamed source told News Nation. “[MGM] basically owns him.”
It is reported that Bruno Mars owes up to $50 million to the esteemed casino. He makes approximately $90 million per year at MGM, but after taxes, Mars may still owe the casino because of his sizable debt. 
Mars has spoken about his affinity for gambling in past media interviews, revealing that he visited his first casino at 19 years old and, as a still unknown musician, covered his rent by playing cards.
Mars’ residency at Park MGM resumes in June, and tickets are available for purchase here.
