This week, half of all the members of Blackpink appear on Billboard’s Pop Airplay chart. Both Rosé and Lisa have solo hits on the tally, which tracks the tunes that are reaching the largest audiences at pop radio across the U.S. It’s not common for any K-pop solo artists to land on the list, and it’s even rarer for two singers from the same group to take up space simultaneously.
Rosé’s on the rise alongside Bruno Mars with their joint single “Apt.” As they climb, so, too does Lisa, who has her own single “Moonlit Floor” reaching fans all throughout the nation. This week, that tune becomes especially important to the Blackpink star as it improves once again.
“Moonlit Floor” steps up one space this week, lifting to No. 34. It may only push a single rung, as it sat at No. 35 last time around, but that means a lot to Lisa, as this new position now marks the highest she’s ever climbed on the Pop Airplay chart.
Before “Moonlit Floor” arrived, Lisa had already earned a pair of solo hits on the pop radio roster. In 2021, her tune “Money” spent four frames somewhere on the ranking, and that cut still stands as her longest-charting win, at least for a short time. “Money” peaked at No. 35 before turning around and falling down. Until now, that stood as Lisa’s loftiest placement on the tally.
Just a few months ago, Lisa doubled her total number of solo smashes on the Pop Airplay chart. “Rockstar” debuted on the Billboard list in August, and it lived on the list for three turns. It only rocked its way to No. 37, however, so it holds as her worst-performing single so far—though it’s not very far behind her other two wins.
Both “Moonlit Floor” and “Rockstar” come from the second era of Lisa’s solo career, outside of her work with Blackpink. She hasn’t announced an album on her own just yet, but with several tunes out already—she’s also shared “New Woman” with Rosalia—it seems like such a move is imminent.
As Lisa reaches her new all-time peak on the Pop Airplay chart, so, too does Rosé. “Apt.,” her global smash with Mars, advances to No. 23 in its third week on the tally. That’s a new career best for Rosé, who has only managed one hit on the radio list on her own.
