Pryor Cashman Partners Ilene Farkas, James Sammataro, Frank
Scibilia, Benjamin Semel, Brad D. Rose, and Donald Zakarin were all
recognized in Billboard's 2024 list of "Top Music
Lawyers."
The list "comprises the attorneys guiding superstars and
industry-driving companies" whose "legal savvy drives the
music business," was selected by Billboard
editors.
Billboard said of Pryor Cashman's elite music
lawyers:
The team of A-list music litigators from Pryor Cashman,
which counts Megan Thee Stallion, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars and all
three major labels as clients, successfully represented Ed Sheeran
at the blockbuster 2023 trial over allegations that he based his
"Thinking Out Loud" on Marvin Gaye's famed
"Let's Get It On." Litigator Zakarin was recognized
on Billboard's 2024 Power 100 ranking for his achievements. And
2024 could be even bigger, as the firm is representing Karol G,
Daddy Yankee and dozens of others in a copyright case over
reggaetón. Pryor Cashman also worked on the Phonorecords
proceedings before the Copyright Royalty Board, where significant
increases in the royalty rates for the 10-year period of 2018-27
were achieved, which the firm says will result in billions in
additional royalties paid to songwriters and music
publishers.
