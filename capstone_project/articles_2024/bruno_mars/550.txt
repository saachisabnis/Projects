	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	










	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

	“APT.,” released Oct. 18, rules the Global 200 for a fifth week with 132.7 million streams (down 9% week-over-week) and 13,000 sold (down 3%) worldwide Nov. 15-21. The duet debuted with 224.5 million global streams and logged 207.5 million in its second frame, becoming the first title since the chart started to have drawn at least 200 million streams globally in multiple weeks.

	“APT.” also now claims five of the top six streaming weeks on the Global 200 among songs released in 2024:

	Lady Gaga and Mars’ “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200, following eight weeks at No. 1, the most for any song this year. It drew 114 million streams (down 4%) worldwide Nov. 15-21 and has tallied over 100 million streams globally in each of the last 12 weeks, the longest such streak since the chart began.

	










	Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” repeats at No. 3 on the Global 200, following three weeks at No. 1 beginning in August, and Gracie Abrams’ “That’s So True” holds at its No. 4 high.

	JIN’s “Running Wild” sprints onto the Global 200 at No. 5 with 47 million streams and 53,000 sold worldwide in the week ending Nov. 21, following its Nov. 15 release on the BTS member’s first solo album, Happy. JIN adds his second solo top 10 on the chart, following “The Astronaut” (No. 10 peak, 2022). BTS’ other members’ top 10 totals as soloists: Jung Kook (five), Jimin (three), V (two) and Suga (one). BTS boasts 11 top 10s as a group.

	Plus, Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” dashes 21-9 on the Global 200, with 44.4 million streams (up 38%) and 3,000 sold (up 35%) worldwide Nov. 15-21. The modern Yuletide classic, originally released in 1994, has spent a record 18 weeks at No. 1 dating to the chart’s start (five frames each over the 2023 and 2022 holidays and four in both the 2021 and 2020 holiday seasons).

	“APT.” concurrently commands Global Excl. U.S. for a fifth week, with 117.4 million streams (down 9%) and 9,000 sold (down 4%) outside the U.S. Nov. 15-21.

	“Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S. following eight weeks at No. 1 and Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” keeps at No. 3, after three weeks at No. 1 beginning in August.

	JIN’s “Running Wild” bounds onto Global Excl. U.S. at No. 4 with 42.9 million streams and 31,000 sold outside the U.S. JIN earns his third solo top 10 on the chart, following “I’ll Be There” (No. 10 earlier this month) and “The Astronaut” (No. 6, 2022). BTS’ other members’ top 10 counts as soloists: Jung Kook (seven), Jimin (five), V (four) and Suga (one). BTS has amassed 11 top 10s as a group.
