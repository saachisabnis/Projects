JB Gill has said it's 'heartbreaking' as he broke his silence on the news he'll now be competing in Strictly Come Dancing with Lauren Oakley. The JLS star was paired with Amy Dowden for the 2024 run of the BBC One dance contest.
The pair were going from strength to strength in the competition when Amy suddenly "fell ill". It was previously revealed that the dancer began to feel unwell after her performance with the singer and presenter and was rushed to hospital during the show's Halloween special at the end of last month.
It forced her to miss the week six results show followed by a week of rehearsals. Amy, therefore, didn't perform during the latest live show on Saturday night (November 2), and Lauren Oakley, who does not have a celebrity pairing on this year's series of the BBC One dance competition, instead stepped.

She rehearsed with JB before joining him to perform the live couple's choice routine to a Bruno Mars medley during Strictly's first-ever 'Icons Week', which saw the pair bag JB's first 10s of the series, resulting in a near-perfect score of 39 out of a possible 40 points.
But Amy's future in the hit dance show this year was confirmed during Monday night's (November 4) edition of Strictly spin-off It Takes Two.
Host Fleur East read out a statement from a Strictly Come Dancing spokesperson which said: "Sadly, Amy Dowden MBE will not be partaking in the rest of the competition this year. Whilst Amy focuses on her recovery following a foot injury, fellow Professional Dancer, Lauren Oakley, will step in as JBâ€™s dance partner."
The spokesperson added: "The health and wellbeing of everyone involved in Strictly are always the utmost priority. The whole Strictly family sends Amy love and well wishes."
Amy went on to share her own statement on social media which began: "My heart is breaking right now. The past few months I finally felt like me again. Cancer was no longer the first thing I thought of when I woke up..."
JB was quick to respond to the emotional post, which ended: JB, I know you and Lauren will continue to ace that dance floor. I'll forever be your biggest cheerleader", writing in the comments section: "Heartbreaking news @amy_dowden but our moments will be forever in strictly history, never forget that. Thank you for being the best teacher. Nothing but love from all of the Gill family."
He also reshared Amy's post to his Instagram Story and said: "Heartbroken for you right now @amy_dowden but like a phoenix you will rise. Isaiah 40:31."
