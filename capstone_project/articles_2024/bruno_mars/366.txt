KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Taylor Swift is feeling 35 as the award-winning pop star celebrates her birthday Friday. While her busy schedule may have come to a pause, after her two-year run of The Eras Tour, her Kansas City look-alike is booked with appearances.
Kelley Thrasher is known around Kansas City as Swift’s doppelganger. She says it has taken her 12 years to come to terms with the resemblance.
“I went to Vegas for the Super Bowl and met Bruno Mars,” Thrasher said. “He thought I was her for a minute. When he found out I was not getting paid to look like that, he told me I needed to monetize that.”
Since June, Thrasher has done 46 appearances.
She does it all when she’s not working her part-time job as a nanny.
“A couple hours of appearances is more [money] than I’ve made in a week,” Thrasher explained.
The look-alike says she has seen the impact Swift has had on Kansas Citians, specifically young girls.
“I am basically a walking example of the Taylor Swift effect. She is just the biggest thing in the entire world,” she said smiling. “But she’s an amazing person. People love her and I love her.”
Thrasher hasn’t met the superstar yet. But if she ever does, she says she would be “Enchanted” as it is part of her “Wildest Dreams.”
In honor of T-Swift’s 35th birthday, downtown Lee’s Summit is hosting a “Merry Swiftmas” event from 5 to 9 p.m. Friday.
Thirteen businesses will offer special discounts, food, and Swift-themed cocktails and mocktails.
Thrasher will make an appearance at Anchora Bella Boutique.
