May 20th, 2015 turned out to be a historic day in Bossier City, Louisiana. Honestly, that night, you wouldn't have had any idea what Taylor Swift would evolve into at the end of the 1989 World Tour. But on that May night, over 12,000 people filed into the (then known as) CenturyLink Center to see her show, and got a glimpse of what was coming.
While it was originally set to be the first date on the tour, Bossier City was actually bumped out of that spot as more dates were added to the tour. But the Bossier City date was still the first full US date on the tour.
She kicked off the whole thing with two shows in Tokyo, Japan on May 5th and May 6th, before coming back to the US. Her first stateside date in 2015 was May 15th, as part of the "Rock in Rio USA" festival in Las Vegas. She shared the main stage in Vegas with Ed Sheeran and Echosmith. The next night the main stage saw Bruno Mars and John Legend.
But on the 20th, it was time to hit a US arena for the first time on the tour, and it was in Bossier City.
One of the other notes about the Bossier City show during the 1989 World Tour is that it was the lowest attended United States stop on the whole tour. The only stops that had less attendance were shows in Amsterdam and Scotland. The Bossier City show sold 12,459 tickets, which was considered a sell out for the night.
Over the whole tour, more than 2 million people attended shows, and the tour generated over $250 million in box office sales.
