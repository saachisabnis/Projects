The Super Bowl is advertising's biggest stage, with companies jockeying for a limited supply of spots to get their products in front of millions of consumers. For the second consecutive year, the average cost of a 30-second ad spot was $7 million. Even as linear ad revenue slips, companies know there's no opportunity guaranteed to reach more people than the Super Bowl.
"Sports is still an advertiser's delight," Disney CEO Bob Iger said during the company's earnings call Wednesday.

This year, consumer packaged goods like Oreos, Pringles, Mountain Dew, Doritos and M&Ms dominated the ad line up. There were plenty of celebrity endorsements from the likes of Christopher Walken, Ben Affleck, Beyoncé, Quinta Brunson, Jenna Ortega, Kate McKinnon and Jennifer Aniston.
There were fewer automotive commercial this year, but those in the mix focused on showcasing new electric vehicles.
Here are some of the notable commercials that aired during Super Bowl 2024:
— Amelia Lucas, Michael Wayland, Micah Washington, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Lorie Konish, Drew Richardson, Dan Mangan and Jordan Novet contributed to CNBC's Super Bowl coverage.
That wraps up the Super Bowl 58 ad slate. 
The biggest snack brands from Oreos, Pringles and Mountain Dew to Doritos, M&Ms and Starry dominated the line up.
There were some head-scratchers, like Martin Scorsese's alien invasion and a curiously shaped Duolingo owl. 
And two commercials even spoofed the 1983 film "Flashdance" — looking at you, Nerds and T-Mobile.
We had stars. We had snacks. We had giveaways. And we had a heck of a lot of fun.

The Kansas City Chiefs are Super Bowl champions. Again.
After an overtime thriller that featured 75 minutes of lead changes, Patrick Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to becoming back-to-back champs. This marks the Chiefs third Super Bowl victory in five years and puts Mahomes on a rare trajectory as a 28-year-old with three Super Bowl rings and a long career ahead of him.
Mecole Hardman caught the game-winning touchdown pass on a cleverly designed play from head coach Andy Reid, and Kansas City erupted into jubilation on the field immediately after.

San Francisco kicker Jake Moody made his third field goal of the game after a lengthy drive to start overtime.

A blank white screen. Minimalist typeface. A series of iconic Disney lines shuffle on screen including "May the Force be with you," "Ohana means family," "Why'd it have to be snakes?" and "Just keep swimming."
It ends with "...Are you ready for it?"
That's how Disney promoted that Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film would be exclusively on its streaming service Disney+ during Super Bowl 58.

In the second T-Mobile ad of the night, Zach Braff and Donald Faison serenade "Game of Thrones" and "Aquaman" star Jason Momoa about the benefits of T-Mobile's home internet to the tune of "Flashdance... What a Feeling."

"Flashdance" star Jennifer Beals appears at the end, asking Momoa to sing it again, this time without his shirt.

The Chiefs knotted the game up at 16-16 after getting stopped in the red zone and opting for a field goal.

When the power flickers, the Bud runs low and the roads are blocked with snow, it's time to deliver fresh kegs of Budweiser the "old school way."
That's the premise of Budweiser's 60-second Super Bowl commercial.
Clydesdales trudge through the snow pulling a wagon filled with a new beer supply and nearly lose their way to the local bar. A friendly dog leads them the rest of the way and the bar erupts in cheers as a keg is wheeled inside.
— Sarah Whitten
Just when it looked like Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs were finding their stride, Brock Purdy and the 49ers surgically drove down the field for the go-ahead touchdown.
Purdy hit a running Jauan Jennings in stride, who then muscled his way into the end zone. Kansas City blocked the extra point to keep it 16-13 in favor of San Francisco.
San Francisco used a blend of Christian McCaffrey on the ground, a big play from wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk and a gutsy decision to go for it on fourth down to take the lead back.

Microsoft's first ad for the big game in four years puts the attention on the company's free Copilot chatbot, which draws on artificial intelligence models from key partner OpenAI. The software maker's Copilot can generate human-like text, create images and answer questions from the web based on a few words of human input. It debuted last year, initially in Microsoft's Bing search engine, and has since shown up in other places, including the Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems.
During the commercial, a young woman uses the Copilot iOS app to generate storyboard images for a script. Other people ask about coding, chemistry and a proposed sign for a truck-repair shop.
After OpenAI's ChatGPT took off in late 2022, Microsoft has spent billions on computing infrastructure to handle generative AI tasks, along with additional investment in the startup. After all that spending, Microsoft wants to make money. In November the company started selling corporate subscriptions on a Copilot add-on for the Microsoft 365 productivity apps, and in January a premium Copilot Pro offering became available.

Kia Motors took a different approach to its Super Bowl ad than other major automakers, leaning into an emotional message about family for its new all-electric 2024 Kia EV9.
The 60-second spot features a young girl figure skating in an arena but in the crowd there's an empty seat next to her father. After the performance, the two traverse snowy roads and terrain in the all-electric SUV to arrive at the girl's grandfather's house.
The father plugs in lights and a speaker to the vehicle's onboard power unit to light a frozen pond. The young girl then performs for the grandfather who wasn't able to make it to the rink.
Kia America Vice President of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC the ad is meant to promote the new vehicle but also Kia's commitment to all-electric vehicles. He said Kia wants to be in the same discussion as U.S. EV leader Tesla when consumers consider an EV.
The Kia EV9 is the first large all-electric SUV from a mainstream brand to compete against the R1S from EV startup Rivian and the pricey GMC Hummer EV SUV.
The ad – set to Cat Power and Coldplay's collaborative track "Wish I Was Here" — was created by California-based David&Goliath, Kia's creative agency.

Kansas City took the lead for the first time after Patrick Mahomes found a wide open Marquez Valdes-Scantling to go ahead 13-10.

Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has kicked the longest field goal in Super Bowl history. The 57-yarder passed through the posts in the third quarter of the big game.

The score now stands at 10 to 6 in favor of the 49ers.

What happens when comedian Eric Andre has a meltdown on an airplane? 
Enter Dr. Umstick.
For its first ever Super Bowl advertisement, frozen dessert maker Drumstick is leaning into absurdist humor. The 30-second spot features a small marionette, reminiscent of those on the British show "Thunderbirds" from the '60s, called Dr. Umstick.
As Andre suffers a vague medical episode 36,000 feet up, a flight attendant asks if there's a doctor on the plane. While there is a real medical professional who offers aid, it's Dr. Umstick that comes to the rescue. Sort of.
He offers the cabin crew and passengers Drumstick ice cream cones. After all, he's not a "body doctor."
— Sarah Whitten
Volkswagen is celebrating its American heritage and new all-electric vehicles with a 60-second ad called "An American Love Story."
The spot features the company's 75-year history in the U.S.– from its iconic VW "Bug," or Beetle, and Microbus "hippie van" synonymous with 1960s counterculture to newer products, including its ID. 4 and ID .Buzz van all-electric vehicles.
The commercial features well-known moments of VW's past in the U.S., including nods to past advertisements of the German automaker.
The ad – set to Neil Diamond's 1971 hit "I Am…I Said" – ends with, "We shape its metal. You shape its soul." It was created by New York-based ad agency Johannes Leonardo.
— Michael Wayland
Mr. T, who played the foil to Rocky Balboa in Rocky III, starred in a Skechers commercial with Tony Romo.

— Jake Piazza
Thirty-two time Grammy winner Beyoncé starred in a Verizon ad that featured her attempting to "break the internet."
In the spot, Beyoncé announces several new newsworthy events, each one topping the last on her quest to "break the internet." Despite it all, she's unsuccessful at overloading Verizon's internet.
The commercial ends with Beyoncé declaring, "Drop the new music," which sent users of social media platform X into a tizzy trying to decode if there was new music from the megastar. 
— Jake Piazza
Doritos is bringing the heat to its Super Bowl ad — and it sent 'abuelas' Dina and Mita to do the dirty work.
The dynamic duo made an appearance Sunday night to promote Doritos 'Dinamita' tortilla chips — spicier varieties of its popular chips in Chile Limon and now four new flavors: Flamin' Hot Queso, Smokey Chile Queso, Tangy Fiery Lime and Hot Honey Mustard.
At the beginning of the minute-long commercial, 'Wednesday' star Jenna Ortega strolls the aisles of a grocery store as Dina and Mita look to snag the last Chile Limon-flavored Dinamita bag on the shelf — before it's quickly snatched by 'Top Gun: Maverick' actor Danny Ramirez. The abuelas go on an action-packed mission to get the bag back.
Doritos are a product of Frito-Lay, a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo.

Toyota Motor showcased its Tacoma pickup truck – one of its most crucial new products – during its return to Super Bowl advertising after a one-year hiatus.
The 30-second ad features the recently redesigned pickup truck racing through different rocky and sandy terrains with passengers screaming "shut the front door" or "woah, woah, woah" while gripping the vehicle's ceiling handle.
The voiceover quips that the handles the passengers were clinging to come standard on every Tacoma: the "shut the front door" handle, "woah, woah, woah, woah" handle, and "no me gusta" handle.
The ad, called "Dareful Handle," was created by Publicis Groupe's Saatchi & Saatchi.
Toyota, which is the "Official Automotive Partner of the NFL," is also airing a 30-second ad in Spanish for the Tacoma during Univision's broadcast of the Super Bowl.
Toyota's choice to showcase the Tacoma stands out from other automakers, which largely used their ads during the big game to feature all-electric vehicles.

Bud Lights' tiny genie grants wishes for football fanatics in the beer brand's 60-second commercial.
Two-time Super Bowl winner Peyton Manning and musician Post Malone join in on the fun as the wishes grow more and more demanding, including a request for a trip to the Super Bowl. 
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the parent company of Bud Light, has been focusing on marketing for sporting events and concerts amid backlash last year following a partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. 
Resulting boycotts dented Bud Light sales, and the beer was dethronement as the best-selling beer in the U.S.

"Here's to science. Here's to the next fight. Let's outdo cancer."
That was Pfizer's message during the big game Sunday, set to "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen.
The pharmaceutical giant was at the forefront of the Covid vaccine push a few years back, but it's been looking to its pipeline and dramatically cutting costs as that business declines.
— Sara Salinas
To remember that Uber Eats delivers almost anything, all you have to do is forget something else. That's the premise of the delivery service's 60-second Super Bowl ad.
Starting with Jennifer Aniston forgetting long-time friend and "Friends" cast member David Schwimmer, the spot showcases celebrities and everyday people forgetting important details.
Victoria and David Beckham forget the name of the girl group Victoria was a member of in the '90s, Jason "Jelly Roll" DeFord forgets he has face tattoos and Usher forgets that he's the Super Bowl Halftime performer.
The ad previously featured a controversial joke about a man forgetting that peanut butter contains peanuts (he's allergic), but it appears that bit was removed.

Lawrence lifts the cart over his head and tosses it back onto the green. The commercial then touts how Oikos yogurt is packed with protein.

Paramount+ mined its deep content library for its Super Bowl ad. 
As Creed's "Higher" plays, "Star Trek" star Patrick Stewart hikes an animated Arnold from "Hey Arnold" and prepares to throw him upwards to the top a mountain cliff.
Stewart and Arnold alongside Drew Barrymore, Peppa Pig, "Survivor" host Jeff Probst, Knuckles from "Sonic" and a few other Paramount-owned characters are making their way up Paramount Mountain and have reached an impasse.
Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has attempted to throw a grappling hook to the top of the cliff face, but fails, complaining if it was a football he could have done it. Stewart suggests throwing the football-headed Arnold, but Tagovailoa and Barrymore don't want to "throw the child."
Stewart, donning an old school football uniform, makes his attempt. He fails and wonders aloud, "Now if there was only someone made of pig skin."
"Oh dear," says Peppa as the commercial ends.

Since the very first Super Bowl in 1967, the championship football game has included a halftime show. However, for decades the headliners were college marching bands, Disney characters and an Elvis impersonator.
It wasn't until boy band New Kids on the Block took the stage in 1991 that fans started to see the mid-game break as a concert-like performance. Then, two years later, Michael Jackson raised the bar.
Here's who has taken the stage in the last decade:

E.l.f. Beauty returned to the big game on Sunday with a Super Bowl ad that featured Judge Judy as "Judge Beauty" and cast members from "Suits" – the USA Network's hit drama from the 2010s that recently got a second life on Netflix. 
The ad features the famed judge overseeing a case against a corporate executive, played by Gina Torres, who is accused of using company funds to buy overpriced makeup. 
The case's plaintiff, played by Rick Hoffman, calls pricey makeup a "scam" and in the end, Torres is sentenced to "$14 glowy skin" courtesy of E.l.f.'s best selling Halo Glow Liquid Filter. 
The spot focuses on a core principle that's at the center of E.l.f.'s identity: Price does not equate to quality, and good makeup can still come at a drugstore price. 
The ad aired just days after E.l.f. posted another quarter of outsized revenue growth and market share gains. The retailer has won over Gen Z and Gen Alpha shoppers with its viral TikTok marketing, but it's looking to expand its share with older shoppers and turn prestige makeup diehards into drugstore believers.

The San Francisco 49ers scored the first touchdown of the game via a savvy play call from head coach Kyle Shanahan.
In a slow-developing trick play that likely felt like an eternity for 49ers fans, wide receiver Jauan Jennings caught a lateral pass from Brock Purdy, then threw it across the field to running back Christan McCaffrey. McCaffrey dashed his way into the end zone to put San Francisco up 10-0 with four minutes left in the first half.

Big changes are coming to Reese's — or are they? The narrator of the candy brand's spot has a handful of dedicated Reese's super-fans and viewers at home on their edge of their seats.

Then comes Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian clan, sitting at her desk talking to a television producer.
"So, every little detail about our family will be on TV? Who would watch that?" Kris asks, reaching for an Oreo. She twists.
Laughing, she replies, "Hope you can keep up."

Former President Donald Trump took some shots hours before the game at pop superstar Taylor Swift and her Kansas City Chiefs player boyfriend Travis Kelce, who have become the focus of a bizarre election-year conservative conspiracy theory.
In a social media post, Trump blasted the idea of Swift again backing his likely November election opponent, President Joe Biden, and claimed to "like" Kelce while admitting the feeling is almost certainly not mutual.
Right-wing social media influencers have claimed, baselessly, that the romantic relationship of the couple is phony, and was cooked up somehow to benefit Biden, whom Swift endorsed in 2020 when he defeated Trump.
"I signed and was responsible for the Music Modernization Act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists," Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. "Joe Biden didn't do anything for Taylor, and never will. There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money."
"Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can't stand me!" Trump added.
Dina LaPolt, an attorney who played a key role in winning passage of the Music Modernization Act, which Trump signed into law in 2018, told Variety, "Trump did nothing on our legislation except sign it, and doesn't even know what the Music Modernization Act does. Someone should ask him what the bill actually accomplished."
The MMA updated copyright law to better compensate performers for music played on digital streaming services, and also provided for compensation for performers who had been shortchanged on payments for recordings made prior to 1972.

How do Nerds Gummy Clusters get all those tangy, crunchy Nerds on the outside? The candy brand's 30-second Super Bowl commercial answers that question.
And the answer is "Flashdance."
As a rendition of Irene Cara's "What a Feelin'" blasts in the background, a giant gummy blob appears on a stage walking toward an empty chair. It pulls a chain dangling overheard, and a shower of rainbow colored Nerds descend, attaching to its form.
The commercial ends with Addison Rae, who rose to fame on TikTok, munching on a bag of Nerds Gummy Clusters.

Famed actor Christopher Walken gets a taste of his own medicine, or at least his own voice, in BMW's Super Bowl ad for its new all-electric i5 sedan.
The 60-second ad is called "Talkin' Like Walken." It starts with the celebrated actor seriously discussing the first BMW 5 Series EV with a valet attendant before lighter-hearted music begins and everyone Walken encounters starts imitating his well-known, dramatic voice and speech cadence.
Although the overall growth of EVs is slower than many expected, sales in the luxury segment remain strong, led by Tesla. BMW's i5 sedan will compete with the Tesla Model S, with a starting price of about $68,000 to $87,000.
BMW's lead U.S. creative agency, San Francisco-based Goodby Silverstein & Partners, created the ad, which also features a cameo by singer and Super Bowl halftime performer Usher.

Temu just aired a Super Bowl ad for the second year in a row. And this one was marred by controversy even before it ran.
The controversial Chinese e-commerce giant, owned by PDD Holdings, skyrocketed to prominence last year after it ran an ad during the big game just a few months after it was founded. For the second year in a row its ad promises the opportunity to "shop like a billionaire."
The company is looking to rival Amazon and win over U.S. shoppers by being the next best "everything store" with lower prices than competitors, but lawmakers say it uses slave labor in its supply chain and spies on its customers. 
The allegations have prompted a congressional investigation into Temu, along with Shein and other apparel retailers with a manufacturing presence in China, from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
"Some people watch the Super Bowl for the commercials as much as the game. It's sickening to think a company built on slave labor with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party is going to make a direct appeal to millions of Americans all at once," committee member Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., told CNBC of Temu's ad. "A flashy advertisement for the site's cheap products is lipstick on the ugliest pig around."
In response, a Temu spokesperson told CNBC its standards and practices surrounding the use of forced labor are "no different" from major e-commerce players like "Amazon, eBay and Etsy" and the allegations "are completely ungrounded." 
"Before setting up their stores and listing products on Temu, every seller has to sign an agreement. This document stands as a pledge to maintain lawful and compliant business operations, and adhere strictly to the legal standards and regulations of their specific markets," the spokesperson said.

Starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda, the spot featured just one snippet of Erivo belting out a line from "Defying Gravity," but promised lots of visual whimsy for fans.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.
A newcomer to this year's Super Bowl advertising slate is Kawasaki, which many may know for its motorcycles and Jet Skis. You won't see those rides in the Japanese company's ad, though. Instead, you'll see the new Kawasaki Ridge two-seat, side x side off-road vehicle.
And you'll see a whole lot of mullets. 
The 45-second ad, called "Mullets," depicts people and animals alike coming into contact with the vehicle and instantaneously growing mullets — the "business in the front, party in the back" hairstyle that was popular in the 1980s and is having a bit of a renaissance. The ad's characters include a bear, turtle, bald eagle — and retired professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin.
It was created by San Francisco-based Goodby Silverstein & Partners.

Once known mainly for gambling and debauchery, Las Vegas has catapulted itself to the world of professional sports in recent years. Now it's hosting Super Bowl 58.
Allegiant Stadium, where the Super Bowl will be played, has spurred change. The $2 billion venue was built for the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders and opened in 2020. It holds a capacity of 65,000 people. This has allowed the city to host events of major magnitude, such as sold-out Beyoncé and Taylor Swift concerts in 2023, and now, the biggest U.S. sporting event of the year. 
"We're not really concerned about our supply of fun being more than the United States or the world can handle," said Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill in August 2023. "We're going to keep adding to that, and we're confident that people around the globe are going to continue to come."
Allegiant Stadium brought 1.52 million incremental visitors to the area, according to the 2023 impact report by the Las Vegas Raiders, with 88% of those visitors saying it was "the primary reason for their visit."

Marcus Collins, University of Michigan marketing professor and 'For The Culture' author, joins CNBC's "Squawk Box" to discuss this year's Super Bowl commercials, whether they make financial sense for companies, and more.
The NFL isn't just the most popular sports league in the U.S., it's also the most valuable with the highest-rated programming and the priciest ad time.
In 2021 the league signed an estimated $110 billion worth of media deals covering 11 years, which reportedly was nearly double the value of its previous contracts.
"If you're the most valuable content on those platforms, you're going to be the bulk of their investment. And that's what we are," said Brian Rolapp, chief media and business officer for the NFL.
An average of nearly 18 million people tuned in to watch football games across TV and digital platforms during the 2023 regular season, the highest since 2015 and the second-highest ever, according to the NFL.
The pinnacle of the NFL's popularity is the Super Bowl, the biggest television event of the year. Of the 30 most-watched broadcasts of all time in the U.S., 22 have been Super Bowl games, according to Nielsen.
The NFL's move to ESPN in the late 1980s catapulted the rise of cable TV. Now, its jump into streaming is having ripple effects across the media and tech landscape.

In what may have been the most tracked travel itinerary in recent memory, Taylor Swift has arrived safely in Las Vegas ahead of Super Bowl 58.
The NFL tweeted on Sunday a picture of Swift on site at Allegiant Stadium, hours after the pop star performed a show in Tokyo, Japan. She was accompanied Sunday by actress Blake Lively and rapper Ice Spice.
Swift arrived back in the U.S. yesterday in Los Angeles, off the heels of four back-to-back shows in the Tokyo Dome.
Public speculation on whether Swift would make it back to the U.S. in time to attend the Super Bowl in support of her boyfriend Travis Kelce (tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs), reached a fever-pitch in recent weeks. The public interest even prompted a press release from the U.S. Embassy in Japan, assuring fans that Swift would be able to pull off the international trek.
