Victoria Monét’s “SOS” is a collaboration 👀 Beyoncé? Chris Brown? Coco Jones? Lucky Daye? Muni Long? SZA? 
my money is actually on Usher. I doubt it’s Lucky. Maybe CB but I could only imagine the reaction to that…
it could be a woman and in the comments she was saying it was a legendary link up. So if a woman, maybe Janet Jackson? That would be cool.
It’s giving an USHER Collab lol

if it’s usher, I doubt it’ll get nominated over his collab with HER that was running the R&B charts all year.
I personally don’t think a Victoria nomination (or even Coco) is guaranteed with their singles tbh. Too much music came out this year. And if it had to be one of them, my bet would be Coco.
you guys were correct, Usher is the feature on Victoria Monét’s new single “SOS (Sex on Sight)”, which is out on 27th August.

Nice! This also strengthens my prediction that USHER is getting into AOTY. Good exposure at the right time (USHER: Rendezvous In Paris is also being released in theaters next month)

Oh it convinced me
Honey, even if Usher: Rendezvous in Paris was NOT happening, Usher was always getting in Album of the Year.  Duh!

damn. This would then put a damper on my hopes of Lucky being AOTY nom for R&B this year. No one has talked about Usher’s new album since it came out (but they are talking about him generally, he trends regularly). Ppl are STILL talking about Lucky’s album and he’s been getting buzz for his tour and doing all the right level of press.
this feels similar to the Mary J Blige nomination with her last album after her Super Bowl performance. Sighhh
Even if Usher gets AOTY nom Lucky Daye could still beat him in R&B Field.
Do ya’ll think Kehlani submits this upcoming mixtape for the Grammys? Or Crash?
Get real!  Lucky Daye is NOT beating Usher in the R&B Field.  Pure delusion.  Lucky will NOT be lucky as he will go home empty-handed.

The word game was insane Gootch
No shade. Lucky has been portrayed negatively on Twitter for the last couple days (I know voters don’t care for it) but it’s just ironic 🤣

An AOTY nomination for Lucky Daye would be interesting, but I don’t think it’s happening. Not to be rude, but I believe there’s been some overhyping of his GRAMMY chances by some of you. I know that the Bruno Mars credits is a big deal, but let’s not forget that Lucky has always worked with D’Mile, and in this album, he doesn’t have an “Over”.
It was a possibility earlier in the year, but now it feels like a long shot. Working with Bruno will strengthen Lucky’s chances in the R&B categories, and that’s it. He will still likely win a GRAMMY for “That’s You”.

USHER’s relatively small amount of buzz could probably be compared to Lucky’s “big buzz”. Oh, and let’s not forget that USHER also performed at the Super Bowl this year. These things are all about FYC campaigns and publicity, and USHER is playing the game too.

honestly, I had Usher as the R&B AOTY pick until I hear Lucky’s album and genuinely believe it’s too good to not hype. A lot of ppl in here and the online R&B community has said he has the best R&B album of the year, award or not. I’m not a crazy Stan or anything and won’t be upset if he doesn’t but I’m hopeful. His label has him doing pretty big press. It could be similar to when Janelle monae got her first AOTY nom for dirty computer. And my excitement for lucky wasn’t meant to downplay Usher. I’d personally love to see him get an award on the main stage. Be tbh I still believe usher is more likely to be the r&b pick for AOTY, but u never know.
and my excitement over lucky is no diff than the ppl In here hyping Normani, Tinashe etc.
and that negative internet drama is stupid. Ppl seem to love to hate him and idk y. here for the music though
