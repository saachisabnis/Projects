	Music lovers have a busy weekend ahead, thanks to all the great new single and album releases throughout the week.

Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars dropped their new song “Die With a Smile.” The musicians barely gave fans a heads up before unveiling the new project, the existence of which they only confirmed less than 12 hours ahead of its arrival. 

	Post Malone also entered his country era with the long-awaited F-1 Trillion. He teamed with Morgan Wallen for the six-week Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper “I Had Some Help,” and his collaboration with Blake Shelton, “Pour Me a Drink,” is at No. 14 on the Country Airplay chart. The album also features collaborations with Luke Combs, Dolly Parton, Jelly Roll, Tim McGraw, Ernest, Hank Williams Jr., Lainey Wilson, Brad Paisley, Sierra Ferrell, HARDY and Chris Stapleton.

	LISA also called on Rosalía for a new collaboration, “New Woman.” “Hit it when I serve/ B—-, you better swerve/ Revving up my, uh-uh-uh-uh-aura/ Focus on my mind/ Taking my time/ I’m a new woman,” LISA declares on the catchy chorus of the Y2K-inspired track.
