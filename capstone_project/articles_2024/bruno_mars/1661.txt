Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, notches a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart (fittingly given its title).

	A week earlier, Swift made history by infusing the Hot 100’s top 14 positions, all from her new Republic Records LP, The Tortured Poets Department, which concurrently adds a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Swift claims three Hot 100 top 10s in the set’s second chart frame, with “Fortnight” joined by “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” at No. 9 and “Down Bad” at No. 10.

	Plus, three acts soar to their first top five Hot 100 appearances: Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” debuts at No. 2; Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” bounds 27-3, after it began at No. 36 two weeks earlier; and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” surges 22-4, two weeks after it entered the chart at No. 7, becoming her first top 10.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 11, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 7. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.

	Below is a rundown of the latest Hot 100’s top 10.

	“Fortnight” makes it two weeks atop the Hot 100. The song drew 38.2 million official streams (down 50%) and 33.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 7%) and sold 6,000 (down 68%) in the U.S. April 26-May 2.

	The single dips to No. 2 on the Streaming Songs chart and No. 4 on Digital Song Sales, a week after arriving atop each chart, and pushes 14-11 on Radio Songs.

	(The two-week reign for “Fortnight” follows the likewise apt one-week command for Barenaked Ladies’ 1998 No. 1.)

	Swift boasts the ninth-most weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100, among her 12 leaders combined, with “Fortnight” having lifted her out of a tie with Adele, Elton John and Bruno Mars for time spent at the summit.

Most Weeks at No. 1 on Hot 100:

	Tommy Richman earns his first Hot 100 hit, as “Million Dollar Baby” blasts in at No. 2 with 38 million streams, 302,000 in radio airplay audience and 4,000 sold following its April 26 release, after he had teased it on TikTok. He tallied his sole prior Billboard chart entry as featured on Brent Faiyaz’s “Upset” (also featuring Felix), which reached Nos. 12 and 33 on the multimetric Hot R&B Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively, last November.

	Sparked by his label affiliation with Faiyaz, Richman logs the highest debut for a first Hot 100 hit by an artist with no prior history on the chart since last August, when fellow Virginia native Oliver Anthony Music became the first act to top the Hot 100 with no previous chart history at all as “Rich Men North of Richmond” roared in at No. 1.

	“Million Dollar Baby” concurrently begins at No. 1 on Streaming Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs. (While its sum of raw streams is the week’s second-highest, after “Fortnight,” “Million Dollar Baby” tops Streaming Songs due to the application of weighting to all titles’ paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streams and programmed/radio streams.)

	Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” flies 27-3 on the Hot 100 with 35 million streams (up 67%), 1.4 million in radio reach (up 741%) and 21,000 sold (up 50%), as it wins the chart’s top Streaming and Sales Gainer awards. It rebounds for a second week atop Digital Song Sales and posts a second frame atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.

	The single, which interpolates J-Kwon’s No. 2-peaking 2004 Hot 100 hit “Tipsy,” marks the first top 10 on the chart for yet another Virginia-born artist (born Collins Obinna Chibueze).

	Shaboozey guests on two tracks on Beyoncé’s new LP Cowboy Carter, the pair of which became his first Hot 100 entries in April: “Spaghettii” (also with Linda Martell; No. 31 peak) and “Sweet * Honey * Buckiin’ ” (No. 61). He recently told Billboard that he’s “so happy to have such a powerhouse of an artist that chose to take this journey to country, so it’s amazing to be a part of that.”

	Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” soars 22-4 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it entered the chart at No. 7, becoming her first top 10. The track drew 30.8 million streams (up 27%), 13.9 million in airplay audience (up 73%) and 4,000 sold (up 13%) in the latest tracking week.

	Further in the Hot 100’s top 10, Benson Boone’s No. 2-peaking “Beautiful Things” rebounds 15-5 and Teddy Swims’ former one-week No. 1 “Lose Control” leaps 18-6, as it tops Radio Songs for a fourth week (70.4 million in audience, up 1%).

	Notably, thanks to Richman, Shaboozey, Carpenter, Boone and Teddy Swims, five songs by artists each charting their first Hot 100 top 10s share space in the region for the first time in nearly two years. On the chart dated June 25, 2022, five such songs ranked at Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10, respectively: Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God),” Glass Animals’ “Heat Waves,” Latto’s “Big Energy,” Chencho Corleone’s “Me Porto Bonito” (with Bad Bunny) and Joji’s “Glimpse of Us.”

	Hozier’s “Too Sweet” jumps 16-7 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it rose to No. 1, as it adds a sixth week each atop the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, Hot Rock Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts.

	Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s former three-week Hot 100 leader “Like That” charges 17-8, as it rules the multimetric Hot Rap Songs for a sixth week.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Swift’s “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” falls 3-9 and “Down Bad” dips 2-10.
