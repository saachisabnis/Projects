Acts like Girls’ Generation’s TAEYEON, SEVENTEEN, (G)I-DLE, IVE, LE SSERAFIM, and RIIZE all scored multiple nods across the Grand awards as well.
The MAMAs officially kicked off in Los Angeles on Thursday, Nov. 21, with a morning media press conference with US performers J.Y. Park and RIIZE previewing their performances. In sharing details about his Anderson .Paak collaborative performance night, Park teased a slightly impromptu performance with his “favorite drummer” where the two focused more on feeling out the performance in the moment. Meanwhile, RIIZE shared their stage invoked Michael Jackson with eldest member Shotaro teasing a dance section between himself and member Wonbin that drew inspiration from an “eclipse.”
Here are the big winners across three nights of awards, performances and more surprises.
