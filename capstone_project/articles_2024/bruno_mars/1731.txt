Author to sign books at Barnes & Noble
California Licensed Forensic Psychologist and author Dr. John C. Brady will sign copies of his new book, “Psychological DNA: A Cold Case Analysis of Who Killed Robert F. Kennedy” at a July 20 event in Gilroy.
The signing will take place 2-6pm at Barnes & Noble, 6825 Camino Arroyo in Gilroy. 
Brady’s book examines Sirhan Sirhan and whether he deserved to be convicted of first degree murder for shooting Kennedy, who was a candidate for president, in 1968. 
“It is my opinion that a second-degree murder conviction would have been far more appropriate,” Brady has said. “One could argue, therefore, that Sirhan is being held today as a political prisoner. My professional opinion is he should have been released decades ago.” 
Brady is a psychologist and criminologist who has painstakingly reviewed the case and, without giving credence to second-shooter theories, concludes that modern diagnoses of Sirhan’s complex mental health issues would make a difference to a California jury had these tools been available at the time, says a press release.
