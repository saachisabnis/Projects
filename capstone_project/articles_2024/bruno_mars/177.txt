Home    Forums    Movies    Joker: Folie à Deux (Part 6)
I’m a huge Gaga fan but this movie was never about her inclusion, she was a plus, the film has always being about Joaquin and his Joker. And it feels like the Screenplay made sure of it.
Finally something we can agree with, I always said this but I understand many here are pissed because is not a Harley Quinn movie and were not fans of the first one.
 Oh wow I’m really shook to find out you’re a woman, I was 100% convinced you were a man all this time. 
🤣🤣 I am a woman and I love Joker I’m not an incel, we exist on Twitter and reddit mostly, the only thing who can prevent this movie not being a huge hit is Todd killing Arthur, if the final is ambiguous like the first one, maybe there’s hope. I’m wishing the best to Gaga with the film, I love her new song with Bruno Mars.
Good news: I still want to see this. The bad news: I have much lower expectations after the reviews.
Don’t you think is weird she’s in a relationship with another psycho killer? No matter how much you want to portray Harley as an innocent angel, she’s still a murderer psychopath
But Ivy/Pamela is not abusing her and doesn’t treat her like shit. 🤷🏼‍♀️ The original point was that it was a good progression for Harley to move on from abusive partner like Joker who treated her badly and used her and never loved her to someone who loved  her and treated her right. It’s definitely not weird that Harley moved on and found someone who as romantic partner is better for her than Joker.
 Trust me there are plenty of women, myself include that are going to see this sequel for Joaquin and his Joker, I don’t know about the gays but I think there are many gays that are fans of the first one, the musical fans are gonna love it because a critic said this is a musical 
and people like me, who did not see the first one, but will now watch it, then this one, because of Gaga.

I hope you enjoy the first one, I hope we can enjoy the sequel.

Actually I have more expectations after the reviews, I don’t alienate with the critics lately, I still think Barbenheimer was a huge scam, and I didn’t enjoy longlegs, I think critics are driven by an agenda

 Wow.. I’ve been seeing you as a man all this time. I’m shocked to hear that you’re a woman. And you love Joker. Nice one

I’m a huge Gaga fan but this movie was never about her inclusion, she was a plus, the film has always being about Joaquin and his Joker. And it feels like the Screenplay made sure of it. The biggest issue the film may had is if the ones who liked the first film, hate this one. And if they do, there’s no way this is as successful as the first one. 
 She’s the reason this sequel generated so much interest though. She’s the reason this discussion is on part 6. People want to see what she bring with Harley Quinn. We all know Joker is a big brand, but this is Lady Gaga we’re talking about here. The Lady Gaga factor is huge here and that’s why a lot of these reviewers are mad that they couldn’t get much from her character. So much chaos is expected from Lee

 Also between Gaga stans online we have some women but I always assume it’s gay men since it’s majority of her fanbase (online at least), at concerts there are always lots of women. Yeah I thought you were a straight male incel all this time  I guess it still makes more sense now you liking Phoenix this much. 
Yes, I love his acting and i love he looks hot right now 😂 I hope he keeps this look for a long time

Maybe on the internet but I haven’t heard anyone in real life mention they’re looking forward to seeing this movie because of Lady Gaga. Joker was the most controversial movie made in 2019 yet it made a billion dollars at the box office, received 11 Oscar nominations and multiple wins. The general public is interested in seeing the follow-up to that blockbuster hit, Joker/Joaquin Phoenix are obviously the main attraction here. I love Gaga but their movie made a billion dollars without her and it would’ve done the same business this time around, whether she’s in it or not.
