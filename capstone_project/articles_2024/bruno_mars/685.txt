24K magic is always in the air for this singer. Bruno Mars’ net worth is very impressive for all the greatest hits he’s written. The singer-songwriter is making headlines after allegedly spending a lot due to gambling. 
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii as Peter Gene Hernandez, Mars was born into a musical Filipino, Jewish, and Puerto Rican family. At the age of 2, he became the world’s youngest Elvis impersonator. He began to grow into his musical talent and partnered with Philip Lawerence and Ari Levine to form the songwriting/producing trio The Smeezingtons while signed to Motown. As part of the producing group, Mars wrote songs for Alexandra Burke, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston.
Mars started to gain widespread recognition when he was featured on B.o.B’s hit single “Nothin’ On You” and Travie McCoy’s “Billionaire.” He then released his single “Just The Way You Are” which peaked No. 1 on the Billboard 100. His career seemed to explode into ultra stardom when his two albums Doo-Wops and Hooligans and Unorthodox Jukebox both peaked No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 
Success doesn’t stop there since he was also featured on Mark Ronson’s viral “Uptown Funk,” and subsequently performed the song at the Super Bowl with Beyoncé and Coldplay. He released his 3rd album 24K Magic to rave reviews. He partnered with Anderson .Paak to make the super duo Silk Sonic where they both won seven Grammys for their album An Evening With Silk Sonic. 
On his success and work ethic, he told NBC News: “Whatever you’re doing just has to be honest — that’s really become the most important thing for me in my career. So if I’m writing a song, I have to be sure that this is the best I can do, deep down in my soul, and that I didn’t take any shortcuts. I have to really believe in what I’m doing for it to work.”

According to NewsNation, Bruno Mars reportedly has $50 million in debt with MGM Casinos. The “Locked Out Of Heaven” singer opened a club called The Pinky Ring in 2024 at the Bellagio Resort and Casino, but still allegedly owes the company money. 
“(MGM) basically own him,” a Vegas source told the publication. “He makes $90 million a year off of the deal he did with the casino, but then he has to pay back his debt… after taxes (Mars makes $1.5 million per night).”
But the casino refuted this claim in a statement issued to E!. “MGM and Bruno’s partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect,” MGM Resorts International said on March 18. “Any speculation otherwise is completely false; he has no debt with MGM.” They continued: “We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers. Together, we are excited to continue creating unforgettable experiences for our guests.”
