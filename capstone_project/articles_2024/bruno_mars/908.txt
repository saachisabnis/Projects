Miley Cyrus enjoyed a "rare" date night with beau Maxx Morando on Wednesday night (September 18) amid ongoing legalities associated with her 2023 chartbuster, "Flowers." 
According to Page Six, the standouts stepped out for a Future Islands show in Los Angeles, just four days after Tempo Music Investments filed a lawsuit against the Hannah Montana alum on grounds of alleged "copyright." 
The pair, who met on a blind date in 2021, arrived at the Shrine Auditorium sporting comfortable fits and smiles. Earlier this week, legal troubles pertaining to Cyrus' GRAMMY-winning single began to unfold, highlighted in documents accusing the artist of "copying" Bruno Mars' 2012 hit, "When I Was Your Man." 
Tempo Music Investments, who own a portion of the popular 2010's track, are suing Cyrus for a plethora of similarities they've found between the two songs. 
"It is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that 'Flowers' would not exist without 'When I Was Your Man.'" 
The complaint went on to detail exactly which parts of the song resemble Mars' tracks most. 
"...the opening vocal line from the chorus of 'Flowers' begins and ends on the same chords as the opening vocal line in the verse of 'When I Was Your Man.'"
Per People, Mars was not named as a plaintiff in the documents. Neither the "Versace on the Floor" star nor Cyrus, who seems to be enjoying her week with Morando, have commented on the lawsuit as legalities pertaining to the case proceed.
