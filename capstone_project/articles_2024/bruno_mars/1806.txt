30th October 2024Words: Daisy Carter 
After teasing fans earlier this week, Lady Gaga finally shared her new single ‘Disease’ earlier this week - a pounding, unapologetic synth-pop anthem that arrives just one month after dropping her surprise project ‘Harlequin’ (a companion album to her recent film Joker: Folie à Deux). 
It’s our first hint of what to expect from the pop superstar’s forthcoming seventh studio album - affectionately referred to as LG7 - which, according to press materials, is due out in Spring 2025 (following the release of ‘Chromatica’ in 2020). What’s more, now she’s offered up an accompanying video - directed by Tanu Muino - which is a dark one, but as iconically Gaga as ever. 
Since ‘Chromatica’, Gaga has collaborated with Tony Bennett (on 2021’s ‘Love For Sale’), Hans Zimmer (on the 2022 soundtrack for Top Gun: Maverick), and most recently Bruno Mars (on August’s ‘Die With A Smile’ - you can check out a live performance of the track from Las Vegas below), but ‘Disease’ is the start of her next solo era proper. And, if this is anything to go by, it’s set to be a big one…
Check out the official video for ‘Disease’ below.
