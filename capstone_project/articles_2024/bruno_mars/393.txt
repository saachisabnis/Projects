This week, Lady Gaga gave her Little Monsters a teaser of when we can all expect to hear her seventh studio album, and it's not as far away as you'd think. According to the itinerary she posted on Instagram from the Venice Film Festival, it looks like there'll be more music from Gaga in October, and that 'Die With A Smile' is not the upcoming album's first single... we'll be watching closely!

Elsewhere in the chart, you've still got 'Short N' Sweet' fever. Sabrina Carpenter’s latest bop ‘Taste’ may have slipped back 1 place to Number 5, but she's got a new entry this week with 'Bed Chem' at Number 30. With 4 songs now in our Top 40, will Sabrina secure the top spot next week?
Are there more Oasis anthems in the Top 40 this week? DEFINITELY Maybe. Having booked a further 2 dates at London's Wembley Stadium on their sell-out Live '25 tour, the British rock royals have 5 songs in the chart as fans feel nostalgic.

Will Sabrina Carpenter overtake Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars next week? Or will it be this week's highest new entry from LINKIN PARK?
