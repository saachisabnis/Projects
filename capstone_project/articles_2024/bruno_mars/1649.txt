Bruno Mars delivered an unforgettable performance this week at the recently inaugurated Estadio GNP in Mexico City, leaving fans awestruck with a special tribute to Latin music, particularly Mexican cumbia.
Known for his electrifying performances, Mars and his band The Hoolingans took his connection with his Latin roots to new heights by incorporating "El Sonidito," a popular cumbia track by the Hechizeros band, into his setlist. The unexpected fusion of this música mexicana hit with his chart-topping "Uptown Funk" not only thrilled the audience but also highlighted his deep appreciation for Latin culture.
The concert was part of Mars' ongoing tour, and from the moment the event was announced, it was clear that this show would be one of the most anticipated of the year. Fans packed the stadium, eager to witness what would become a night filled with musical surprises.
As the beat of "El Sonidito" echoed through the venue, the crowd erupted in cheers, and videos of the performance quickly went viral on social media, showcasing Mars' ability to connect with his diverse fan base. The song is a legendary Cumbia Sonidera and part of Mexico City musical fabric. It was an unforgettable moment, in particular because they played with arrangements of Quebradita, another very Mexican rhythm.

Beyond this musical homage, Mars' ties to Latin music and culture run deep. Born Peter Gene Hernandez, Mars' father is of Puerto Rican and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, while his mother is of Filipino and Spanish heritage. Growing up in a culturally rich household in Hawaii, Mars was exposed to a variety of musical styles, including Latin music, which influenced his eclectic sound.
He has often spoken about the pride he takes in his heritage, famously rejecting the notion that he changed his stage name to distance himself from his Latino roots. Mars has always embraced his identity, and moments like his recent concert in Mexico City are a testament to this. He has also embraced salsa and played Brazilian music during the tour's stops in the South American country.

The night was not only a celebration of his musical prowess but also a reaffirmation of his connection to his Latino ancestry. Bruno Mars has previously stated that he never shied away from his heritage and has even expressed frustration when people assumed otherwise. His performance in Mexico City, especially the inclusion of a cumbia/quebradita track, served as a powerful reminder of his cultural pride and his ongoing effort to honor his roots.
Mars' concert was filled with energy as he performed hits like "Finesse," "Treasure," and "Perm," all while engaging with the audience in Spanish, further deepening his bond with his fans. The night was capped off with more intimate moments, as Mars slowed down the tempo to perform soulful ballads like "Versace on the Floor" and "When I Was Your Man," providing a perfect balance to the high-energy show.
Bruno Mars' night in Mexico City was more than just a concert; it was a celebration of his cultural heritage and a clear message to his fans that no matter where he is, his Latino roots remain an integral part of who he is as an artist
