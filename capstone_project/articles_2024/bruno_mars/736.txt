Now, this sounds like a fun time. Bruno Mars shared a little about his night hanging out with Rosé, and it seems a lot went down! But, don't worry, it was a "super chill night."
On Instagram, Bruno shared a photo of himself with Rosé as they had their hands, one on top of the other, apparently playing a Korean drinking game with a few other people. He captioned the snapshot, "So this was me hanging on for dear life after @roses_are_rosie introduced me to this Korean drinking game and got me saucy. Soon after, she tried to kiss me, and I was like 'woah Rosie! what part of the game is this?' She was like, 'I ain’t playin games wit you anymore lil boy! Big Rosie bout that BIDNESS!' Shaken, I replied 'stop Rosie, I’m scared!' But other than that, super chill night."
Rosé also shared a picture from her night with Bruno, laughing and having a grand ol' time. She wrote along with the photo, "The night i taught bruno how to play a Korean drinking game." Mars also commented on her picture, "So much fun! Remember when you tried to kiss me? that was weird. Other than that sick pic!"
Are they newfound friends? Are they collaborating on music? It remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure — FOMO!
