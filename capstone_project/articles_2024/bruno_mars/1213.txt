JB Gill has revealed just how much he admires his Strictly Come Dancing partner Amy Dowden for her "fight and determination" after she was forced to exit the high-stakes BBC contest early due to a foot injury.
The JLS heartthrob, who's now strutting his stuff with pro Lauren Oakley, nostalgically reflected on the top-notch teamwork with Welsh whirlwind Dowden since the first beat of this year’s edition of the BBC One extravaganza.
Dowden, 34, made a striking comeback to the Strictly dance floor to celebrate its 20th series shimmer, after bravely bowing out last season amidst her cancer treatment crusade. Flowing with gratitude in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, complete with a snap of Dowden in her dancing glory, Gill penned his overflowing thanks to Amy for her unwavering commitment as his dance floor ally, sharing their excitement at collaborating.
Amy echoed her sentiment in an upbeat Instagram story, treasuring the "memories we will cherish forever" and making a heartfelt vow to her celeb partner: "We will dance again". Gill didn't hold back, confessing that "It’s been heartbreaking seeing the wonderful journey we’d begun come to a halt."
Appreciation poured from his words, declaring: "That said, I have nothing but admiration for you. Your fight and determination are second to none." The singer serenaded her spirit and dedication, asserting: "Your dedication to your art shines through in your passion for what you love. You would literally give anything to be on that ballroom floor dancing and I feel truly honoured to have shared it with you for six weeks."
Gratitude wrapped up Gill's message, as he praised Dowden's support: "Thank you for your patience and support through every week. Thank you for trusting me with your creativity, doing everything in your power to enhance my ability and make it resonate on a Saturday night."
Amy Dowden has shared an emotional post thanking her dance partner and reflecting on their time together in Strictly Come Dancing. She posted saying, "Thank you for being the best teacher and helping me to fall in love with new styles of dance week after week after week."
"You are one of life’s special people and although our strictly journey ends here, you will dance again and I know it won’t be the end of our partnership. Our memories and moments will forever be in Strictly history and I have no doubt you’ll be back, stronger and better than ever. God bless you always."
She continued in her post, expressing her gratitude towards JB Gill: "Oh @jbgill made me cry (again) thank you, thank you, thank you! I’ve been flicking through our pics and vids and memories we will cherish forever and we will dance again, but for now continue in your words, being ‘dope’, on that dance floor." She urged him to "Keep continuing to enjoy and embrace this magical Strictly journey with the wonderful Loz!"
On Monday evening, Amy revealed on Instagram that she's heartbroken as a foot injury thwarted her chances to compete for the 2024 glitterball trophy. Gratefully, she highlighted how perfect Gill was as a partner, calling him a "talented, kind, gentle soul". Dowden had previously missed a week of competition over the weekend, spectating as Gill and Oakley delivered a Bruno Mars medley performance, earning the highest score of the series so far from the sidelines of the Elstree studio.
Just the weekend before, following the live show, she had felt unwell and was taken to hospital as a precaution, missing Sunday's results show, her representative confirmed at the time. On Monday, a Strictly spokesperson gave the sad news that Amy Dowden MBE would be withdrawing from this year's series: "Sadly, Amy Dowden MBE will not be partaking in the rest of the competition this year."
Explaining her absence, they said, "Whilst Amy focuses on her recovery following a foot injury, fellow professional dancer Lauren Oakley will step in as JB’s dance partner." Reiterating their commitment to wellness, the spokesperson added, "The health and wellbeing of everyone involved in Strictly are always the utmost priority. The whole Strictly family sends Amy love and well wishes."
Overcoming obstacles, Dowden had been vocal about her battle with stage three breast cancer, receiving treatments ranging from mastectomy to chemotherapy. Earlier this year, she shared an uplifting update that her tests indicated "no evidence of disease". The inspirational Caerphilly dancer has been candid about her experiences, bringing her cancer fight and living with Crohn’s disease into the spotlight through various BBC documentaries.
