	“APT.” is already a breakout hit from Rosie. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, becoming the first song by a Western act to rule the Japan song chart in more than 11 years. The song also spends a fourth week atop both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts.

	When sharing the news of her first-ever solo LP last month, Rosé wrote: “I have poured my blood and tears into this album. I cannot wait for you to listen to this little journal of mine. Rosie – is the name I allow my friends and family to call me. With this album, I hope you all feel that much closer to me. And yes, it’s a full length album.”

	According to the press release, ROSÉ co-produced and cowrote the album, which is her “most personal and candid” project yet.
