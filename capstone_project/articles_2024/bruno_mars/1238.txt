If you were planning a trip down to the Victoria Park Bandstand this afternoon to see Newbury’s own Project Band, then you might wonder where they are…
Due to the inclement weather the gig has been moved from the exposed outdoor bandstand to the Bacon Arms in town.
Last summer the band also fell victim to the weather and were forced indoors by high winds.
Project Band, founded by Simon Currie, saxophonist with The Manfreds since 2001, encourages budding or hobby musicians to develop their musical skills and have fun at the same time by playing in the band with other like-minded people, guided by an expert tutor.
Project Band welcomes players of saxophones, flute, clarinet, brass plus piano, guitar and rhythm section aged 16+ to play modern pop, soul, funk and jazz in an enjoyable and nurturing band setting.
There’s plenty of scope for confident players to develop improvisation skills in the sessions too.
All the musical arrangements and backing tracks used are available on the Project Band website, so sight-reading isn’t necessary.
