J. Cole fired back at Kendrick Lamar on his brand-new album. On Friday, April 5, Cole shocked the world when he delivered his surprise project Might Delete Later. The Dreamville founder opens the album with his "Pricey" collaboration with Ari Lennox, Gucci Mane and Young Dro. He continues with other stand-out tracks like "Crocodile Tearz," "Ready '24" featuring Cam'ron (which samples The Diplomats' "I'm Ready"), "H.Y.B" with Bas and Central Cee plus "Pi" featuring Daylyt and Ab-Soul. On the closing track "7 Minute Drill," Cole offers up a response to Kendrick Lamar's verse on Future and Metro Boomin's "Like That." 
"Your first s**t was classic, your last s**t was tragic," Cole spits over the T-Minus & Conductor Williams-produced beat. "Your second s**t put n***as to sleep, but they gassed it/Your third s**t was massive and that was your prime, I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine/Now I'm front of the line with a comfortable lead/How ironic, soon as I got it, now he want somethin' with me." "The rap beef ain't realer than the s**t I seen in Cumberland," he continues. "He averagin' one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin'/If he wasn't dissin', then we wouldn't be discussin' him/Lord, don't make me have to smoke this n***a 'cause I f**k with him/But push come to shove, on this mic, I will humble him." Cole also says the his scathing track is just a "warning shot to back n***as down." He ended the song by hyping up the arrival of his long-awaited album The Fall Off. The seasoned MC has been boasting about his alleged final album for years. He recently ramped up the anticipation for the project in his Might Delete Later vlogs, which is where he first previewed "Crocodile Tearz." Kdot isn't the only one who felt the brunt of Cole's verbal assault. Fans believe Future also caught some stray shots in his song "Pi." "They sound faded, they downgraded, they Pluto/ I’m bigger than Mars, this nigga a star, I’m Bruno,” he raps. Listen to the entire album below. WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE
