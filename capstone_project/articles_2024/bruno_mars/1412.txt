Bruno Mars and ROSÉ have joined forces on her new single, “APT.,” which is available to stream now. There’s also a new music video to go along with the track, which Bruno co-directed with Daniel Ramos. “‘APT.’ is actually my favorite Korean drinking game that I play with my friends back home,” ROSÉ said in a press release. “One night in the studio I taught my crew how to play the game. Everyone was fascinated, especially when I started the chant, so we played around with it and I said we should make a song out of it… and after Bruno joined the track, the rest became history!”
