ROSÉ, the 27-year-old global sensation and member of BLACKPINK, has officially stepped into her solo era with the release of her debut album, rosie! Dropping on Friday (December 6), the highly anticipated record features 12 tracks, all co-written and executive produced by ROSÉ herself—a testament to her artistry and creative vision.
Fans have already been treated to some highlights from the album, including her sultry collaboration “APT.” with Bruno Mars and the catchy anthem “number one girl.” But the surprises didn’t stop there. Alongside the album’s release, ROSÉ also dropped a cinematic music video for her track “toxic til the end,” featuring none other than Gossip Girl star Evan Mock.
In the lead-up to the album’s release, ROSÉ shared her excitement during an interview with Nova 100’s Jase & Lauren. “Oh my god! I mean, it’s crazy!” she exclaimed. “I’m like, I’ve been ready for it to be out, so I’m just, it’s a day of celebration! I’m extremely happy. I feel like I’ve been saying it as a joke, I’ve been pregnant for too long with this baby, I’m ready for it to be out.”
And it truly feels like a labour of love. From writing to producing, ROSÉ has poured herself into every note, ensuring that the album reflects her artistic journey and personal growth.
Just hours before the big release, ROSÉ couldn’t contain her excitement and took to Instagram to share a heartfelt message with her followers. “toxic til the end in just a few hours!!!!!!!!!!!!! and my album!!!!!! someone pinch me now. it’s all happening😭 I am so excited to share this song, video, and the whole album with you all. it’s all yours in just a few more hours ♡ hope you all love it,” she wrote, capturing the anticipation and joy of the moment.
The accompanying music video for “toxic til the end” is already turning heads, with Evan Mock’s brooding presence and the video’s moody, high-fashion aesthetic perfectly complementing the song’s raw emotion. It’s a visual and sonic feast that showcases ROSÉ’s versatility as both a performer and a storyteller.
With rosie, ROSÉ is stepping into a new chapter of her career, proving she’s not just a member of one of the biggest girl groups in the world but also a dynamic solo artist in her own right. Her ability to craft deeply personal yet universally relatable songs is evident throughout the album, and fans around the world are celebrating this new era with her.
