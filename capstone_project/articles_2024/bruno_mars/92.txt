Motsi Mabuse caused a stir on the live episode of Strictly Come Dancing when she abruptly declared "I'm going home" in the midst of an on-air disagreement with fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood.
The panel's opinions diverged considerably after Olympic athlete Montell Douglas danced a Waltz to Whitney Houston's classic I Will Always Love You alongside her dance partner Johannes Radebe. When it came time to critique, Craig remarked: "I wish it could've been a little bit softer, a little bit lighter throughout."
Craig's commentary was cut short as he mentioned: "It bothered me that your frame was constantly going in and out." Head judge Shirley Ballas interjected, stating, "I don't agree with you at all."
Joining in, Motsi exclaimed: "I'm going home," before switching seats with Shirley, reports the Mirror. The scene sparked chatter among viewers on social media, with one fan posting: "Motsi is just hilarious."
However, there was criticism about Motsi and Shirley cutting Craig off. One viewer commented: "What gives Motsi and Shirley the right to not allow Craig to give his opinion? This is not the first time they've cut him off and prevented him from finishing his critique. If men did that to a female judge there would be mayhem!".
Another chimed in: "How are the celebs meant to improve if they don't hear critique! It can't all be love and positivity." An agreement came from a fellow Strictly enthusiast who noted: "Totally agree, this series both Shirley and Motsi have interrupted Craig many times, he doesn't interrupt them, it's rude, nasty and drives me mad. Please stop."
Strictly Come Dancing lit up our screens with the debut of Icons Week, seeing hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman cheer on the 10 couples still in the competition.
The audience was touched as they watched Amy Dowden struggle to contain her emotions when her partner JB Gill, alongside stand-in professional dancer Lauren Oakley, earned almost perfect marks for their routine.
Dancing the Couples Choice on Saturday (November 2) to a Bruno Mars medley, JB and Lauren wowed the panel. Judges Shirley Ballas, Motsi Mabuse, and Anton Du Beke awarded top scores of 10 while Craig Revel Horwood handed them a 9, accumulating to an impressive 39 points.
The score visibly moved Dowden, who despite being hospitalised after last week's live show, returned to the ballroom floor in support of JB. Lauren stepped in for Amy after she had to be taken urgently to the hospital post-performance last weekend.
During the broadcast, Claudia revealed that Amy had a hand in this week's choreography: "You three did this together this week, didn't you?".
Confirming their teamwork, Amy replied: "Yes, it's been a real dream team," adding an anecdote: "To the point where Lauren put in our chat 'J, do you want a coffee?' which I replied: 'yes, he'll have a vanilla latte'."
Following Amy's health scare last week, a spokesperson provided a reassuring update: "Amy was feeling unwell and so an ambulance was called as a precaution. She is feeling much better and would like to thank the Strictly family for their love and concern. We request Amy's privacy in matters of health is kindly respected."
