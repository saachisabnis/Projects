These songs are the perfect way to celebrate the special relationship you share with your dad.

 The father of the bride has arguably one of the largest roles on the wedding day: He escorts his daughter down the aisle, gives a heartfelt speech at the reception, and, of course, takes the dance floor with the woman of the hour to kick off the party part of the evening. Though the first two duties are always emotional, few wedding moments are more touching than that father-daughter dance. Traditionally, it's the second dance of the wedding, immediately following the first dance between the newlyweds. (Of course, if there's another special person in your life whom you see as a father figure, you can share your special moment with them instead; this could be the person who gives you away if you choose to uphold that custom). Since this is such a defining moment of your wedding, you want to pick a father-daughter dance song that really speaks to your bond and the mood.

 Finding the perfect choice among the endless options out there can be tricky, though. The relationship you have with your dad is singular, so you don't want to choose a tune that feels cliché or overdone—but you also don't want to go so niche that you miss the mark. We encourage you to remember that the only thing that really matters is that the song sings to both of you; maybe it's the melody he played when he put your feet over his in your living room so you could dance at his level or perhaps it's the tune you'd belt at the top of your lungs together on the way home from soccer practice. It doesn't need to be anything other than yours—use that advice as your guiding light on your father-daughter dance song search.

If you don't know where to start, pick a genre you both love first, and search within that category of music. There's bound to be a song that fits the bill.
 We're here to aid with that search, too. To help you choose the perfect tune for your tender moment with Dad, we've compiled 85 of the best, most poignant father-daughter dance songs out there.

The father-daughter dance typically occurs during the reception after the meal and toasts. This dance, along with other family dances, is a great way to transition into an open dance floor.
The father-daughter dance is a sweet moment between brides and their fathers, and symbolizes their appreciation for the love and guidance they received throughout their lives.
