Were you as impressed as we were when Wasp raised his voice in song for the first time on "The Masked Singer"? He wowed us with his flawless cover of the Justin Timberlake hit “Rock Your Body” on the Oct. 16 episode. We've rewatched that performances by Wasp and his clues package.
Forget those guesses by the judges that Wasp is Jason Derulo, Taye Diggs or Bruno Mars. We are sure we know Wasp's true identity. Keep reading as we have all your "The Masked Singer" spoilers, including the answer to the question, "Who is Wasp?"
We were convinced that Wasp is Mario. Don't believe us? Besides the fact that the Wasp sounds just like him, consider how so many of the clues fit in with the life of Mario.
Mario has racked up a whopping 591 million streams of his tunes. That goes a long way to contributing to this season's celebrities on "The Masked Singer," who have amassed a total of 4.1+ billion streams.
The Ambassador for Wasp was season 10 winner Ne-Yo. He revealed that he has known Wasp "since he was fresh on the scene and he gained huge success by taking my words of wisdom." Ne-Yo wrote the hit song "Let Me Love You" for Mario.
Wasp said he "grew up in a tough neighborhood." Mario is from west Baltimore and was raised by his grandmother while his mother struggled with addiction issues. He was proud of the fact that his career brought him to "biggest screens and stages in the world.” That certainly describes Mario's meteoric rise to fame as a teenager. His self-titled debut disc sold almost one million copies and he toured the world.
The clues package was presented in in the form of a comic book. Mars made us think immediately of Mario's most recent album, "Closer to Mars."
And the Sports Night clue was a pair of sneakers, about which Wasp said to Nick, "These fresh kicks help me stay on my game.” Mario was on the same bill as Nick for the "Scream Tour 3."
On October 23, Wasp was in fine form with his cover of the Demi Lovato hit "Skyscraper." He then spoke movingly of his childhood when his dad was not around; Mario's father, gospel singer Derryl Barrett Sr., was not a big presence in his early years.
We will only find out if we are right that Wasp is Mario when he is unmasked. That will happen when he loses a vote or wins the show. Do you think we are right about the true identity of Wasp? Sound off in the comments section with your best guesses.
