A new show has been added, he will now be performing for two nights
Award-winning American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars is set to initially perform one night at the National Stadium this April 5, 2024. However, due to overwhelming response, he has added¬†two additional shows on April 3 and 6. It has been over 5 years since his last performance in 2018 at the Singapore Stadium.
Mars has earned numerous accolades throughout his career. The Grammy Award-winning artist has secured a total of fourteen Grammy Awards across various categories, showcasing his prowess in genres ranging from pop and R&B to funk and soul. Notable among his achievements are the prestigious Record of the Year (2018 and 2016) and Album of the Year (2018) for his album 24K Magic. He has consistently delivered chart-topping hits, including earworms such as Just the Way You Are, Uptown Funk, and Locked Out of Heaven.‚Äù¬†
Beyond his Grammy success, he has also been honoured with an array of other prestigious awards, including American Music Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards, and Billboard Music Awards. He has also made it into the Hot 100 list seven times, making him the top artist with the most Hot 100 entries among other male artists.
All sales for April 5 and 6 has been sold out. Sales for April 3 will commence January 25, 12pm via Ticketmaster.¬†¬†
