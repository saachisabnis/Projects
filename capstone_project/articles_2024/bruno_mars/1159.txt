Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez may be history, but the extravagant wedding plans they once had – including a hefty performance fee from Bruno Mars – are far from forgotten.
Marcy Blum, a renowned celebrity event planner, recently revealed an interesting tidbit about Lopez, 55, and Rodriguez, 49, and their wedding plans before their split. 
According to Blum, who spoke on The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast on Thursday, December 26, Lopez had expressed interest in having Mars, 39, perform at their wedding, but the couple balked at the astronomical fee for the "24K Magic" singer.
Blum recalled that when Lopez brought up Mars, she had to let the superstar know just how much the singer charged for a performance. "I had just worked with Bruno Mars, and he received $5 million for a performance lasting 45 minutes to an hour," Blum shared. Lopez's reaction was less than thrilled, according to Blum, with the singer saying, "Don't be ridiculous!"
Lopez and Rodriguez, who had been dating since 2017 and got engaged in 2019, had initially planned to marry in Italy in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a postponement of their wedding. In 2021, the couple called off their engagement, and Lopez soon rekindled her romance with Ben Affleck.
The couple, known as Bennifer, famously eloped in Las Vegas in 2022, followed by a more formal celebration in Georgia. Just two years later, their whirlwind romance seemed to hit a rough patch. In August 2024, Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck, citing "irreconcilable differences."
