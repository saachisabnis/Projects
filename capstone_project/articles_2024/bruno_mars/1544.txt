Jennifer Lopez almost dropped big bucks to get her dream performer for her and Alex Rodriguez’s wedding.
Celebrity wedding planner Marcy Blum opened up about working on the exes’ nuptials before their eventual split on the Thursday, December 26, episode of “The Skinny Confidential Him & Her” podcast. “I’ll tell you a story because I never signed an NDA,” she stated.
According to Blum, her clients are often shocked by “the price of headliners,” and Lopez, 55, and Rodriguez, 49, were no exception. “We were working with J.Lo and A-Rod before they broke up. And we’re going through a list of musicians and she goes, ‘What about Bruno Mars?’” she shared.
Having recently worked with Mars, 39, at the time, Blum surprised Lopez with the “Treasure” singer’s hefty fee. “I said, ‘I just worked with him and he’s $5 [million],’” she revealed. “[Jennifer said], ‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ I said, ‘I’m telling you, $5 million plus rider.’ The night [of the wedding], you get 45 minutes, you get an hour.”
Blum didn’t reveal whether Lopez agreed to Mars’ price point, but the wedding eventually fell through after she and Rodriguez ended their engagement in April 2021.
When it comes to working with high-profile performers for events, Blum said she and her team “don’t give them an excuse to be obnoxious” by catering to their needs. “We’re like, ‘Here we go, and here’s someone who’s gonna handhold you and da da da,’” she said.
Blum said it’s also not normal to have a celebrity such as Mars as the “regular entertainment” of the event. “No one wants to do their first dance, or maybe they do but they shouldn’t, to Coldplay or something. That’s just dumb,” she quipped. “What you want is you want a band-band and maybe a DJ, and then you want 45 minutes of Chris Martin or Elton John or whomever you want. Because otherwise, it’s all about them.”
Lopez and Rodriguez got engaged after two years of dating in March 2019. News broke that the two had called it quits in March 2021, but the pair did not confirm their split until the following month.

“Jen really does wish Alex the best,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in June 2022. “She’s completely moved on. She doesn’t give any thought to Alex. Their relationship was filled with drama and that’s the last thing she has time for in her life.”
Rodriguez noted that he and Lopez “had a great time” in their relationship on a July 2022 episode of “The Martha Stewart Podcast.” He added, “More importantly, we always put the kids front and center in everything we do.” (Lopez shares her 16-year-old twins, Max and Emme, with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Rodriguez shares his two daughters, Natasha, 20, and Ella, 16, with his ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.)
Lopez moved on with Ben Affleck, whom she filed for divorce from after two years of marriage in August. Rodriguez, meanwhile, briefly dated Kathryne Padgett in 2022 before finding love with his girlfriend, Jaclyn Cordeiro, later that year.
