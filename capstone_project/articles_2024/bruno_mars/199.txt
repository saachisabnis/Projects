The Rock and Roll Playhouse has officially released its debut album, Friends Rock! The new collection of kid-friendly music comes from Republic Records: Kids & Family and serves as the initial full-length body of work from the No. 1 kids live concert series in the U.S.
Across the set, some of rock music’s most recognizable anthems appear in kid-ified form, shifted to presentation with age-appropriate consideration. The tracklist represents the ideal starting point for any young music lover, introducing them to modified favorites such as Queen’s “You’re My Best Friend,” Beatles’ “We Can Work It Out,” and more. 
In addition to rock-and-roll staples, the set includes a take on the beloved Friends theme song “I’ll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts. The recognizable tune has also served as The Rock and Roll Playhouse’s official anthem, making its inclusion an obvious choice on the first-time release. 
The Rock and Roll Playhouse began in 2014 at the flagship Brooklyn Bowl venue by esteemed concert promoter Peter Shapiro and educator Amy Striem. Shapiro tapped Angela C. Santomero (Blue’s Clues and Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood) for the album, who extended her services by adding music producer Stef Fink into the mix.
On the release, Shapiro comments, “I cannot wait to witness the magic that happens when you introduce our interpretations of classic rock and roll to families through these upcoming albums.”
Santomero adds, “The albums are inspired by the popularity of kid’s audiobooks and podcasts – mixed with everyone’s favorite rock songs. I love how the characters come alive to celebrate friendship through song!”
In addition to a full-length set, the live music experience provided by The Rock and Roll Playhouse is offered at various concert locations, ranging in material from Sofi Tukker to the Grateful Dead and Bruno Mars to Queen.
