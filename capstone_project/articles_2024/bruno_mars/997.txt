The Clippers will play at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood for the first time Monday night, facing the Dallas Mavericks in a preseason game at what is billed as a “technologically advanced and basketball-obsessed arena and entertainment venue (that) will deliver a uniquely intimate and intense experience that will redefine what it means to be the best arena in the world.”
The Intuit Dome’s features include:
• The two-sided “Halo Board” scoreboard that encircles the arena with nearly an acre of lighting, covering 38,375 square feet
• “The Wall,” a 51-row section with strict rules designed to ensure only Clippers fans are admitted – through restrictions on ticket resale and the wearing of opposing team gear
• The standing-only “Supporters Section” described by the team as “built to hold 300 of our most passionate Clippers fans”

Fans attending events will have to download the Intuit Dome app and create an account to enter the venue. Once the account is created, ticketholders can set up a “Game Face ID” that allows them to walk directly into the arena without displaying a ticket, or use an “Identity Pass” that requires people to scan a smartphone ticket to enter.
The arena is also cashless, so people must upload a payment method onto the Intuit Dome app to make concession and retail store purchases.
