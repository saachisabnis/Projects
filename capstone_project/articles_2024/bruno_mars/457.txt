Rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg is at it again with another canned drink hitting the market with the launch of Cali Cocktails. In partnership with the wine brand 19 Crimes, the canned cocktails are inspired by Snoop’s “laid-back” Cali lifestyle.
According to the news release, it's available in two flavors: Smokin’ Strawberry Margarita and Long Beach Lemonade. The Cali Cocktails features an agave wine base. Both flavors are lightly carbonated with “bold flavors.”
“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Snoop Dogg and celebrate another hot product launch,” explained Kris Ann Brady, vice president of marketing at 19 Crimes, in a statement. “19 Crimes has always pushed the boundaries of traditional wine culture, and together with Snoop, we’re ready to disrupt the RTD space.”
Cali Cocktails is Snoop Dogg’s fifth collaboration with 19 Crimes and joins his popular portfolio of wines Snoop Cali Red, Cali Rosé, Cali Gold, and Cali Blanc. Rolling out now at retailers nationwide, Cali Cocktails are packaged in 335-ml cans and available in four-packs for a suggested retail price of $14.99.
“It took a while to perfect this one, but it’s just on time. California has always been home, so it only made sense to celebrate that California state of mind as my next ‘Cali’ creation,” Snoop Dogg shared. “To everyone doing their thing, in Cali, or elsewhere, this toast is for you. This coast is for you.”
In April, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg teamed up to launch their canned cocktail brand Gin & Juice. The company, of course, gets its name from Snoop Dogg’s Doggystyle track “Gin and Juice,” which was produced by Dr. Dre.
According to FoodManufacturing.com, the Gin & Juice pre-mixed cocktail has a 5.9% ABV and four flavors. These flavors include citrus, apricot, melon, and passionfruit. The brand is sold in packs of four, one of each flavor. They can be found at participating retailers and liquor stores starting at $11.99.
“Together, we always try to create magic, we’re having fun being creative, and everything about this product is really us,” Dr. Dre told the outlet. “There’s passion behind it, and friendship and love and a culture. We’re shooting to make everything we do magnificent, and fortunately, most of the time, we hit the target.”
Snoop Dogg added, “A lot of times people have been in a relationship for 30 years and can’t talk to each other, can’t hang out, so it’s just fun to be in a partnership with people that you actually love.”

Snoop Dogg's longstanding legacy in the culture is incredible: he is a "one of one." The California-bred rapper born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. has remained relevant since the beginning of his career. He rose to fame after Dr. Dre enlisted him on the single "Deep Cover" and later his album The Chronic. Both the single and album were released in 1992.
Snoop eventually ventured out on his own path and released his debut album, Doggystyle (1993). It had great success as it took over the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and the Popular chart.
Doggystyle was only the beginning. Snoop has 19 studio albums. He later left Death Row Records in 1998 and signed to No Limit Records and released three albums: Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). After he released those three albums, he went to Priority/Capitol/EMI Records and dropped Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002). Over the years he was signed to the aforementioned labels as well as Geffen Records, that produced R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'.
Snoop Dogg wasn't always just "Snoop Dogg." Throughout his career, he actually changed his name to Snoop Lion when he converted to a Rastafarian. He eventually went back to his original stage name in 2015 after he released his reggae album Reincarnated (2013).
Snoop Dogg is now the owner Death Row Records, the first label to put him on. The acquisition of the label happened in 2022. Also that same year, he took the stage with Dr. Dre, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, and surprise guest 50 Cent at the LVI Super Bowl Halftime Show.
Outside of music, Snoop has been the host of several baking shows with Martha Stewart and hosted American Song Contest with Kelly Clarkson. Whether it is new music, a competition show on television, or the world's biggest stage, Snoop is always front and center in our culture.
Take a look at 10 of the West Coast rapper's best songs:
Snoop puts his own West Coast twist on Doug E Fresh’s classic “La Di Da Di”, which featured Slick Rick. The 1993 track "Lodi Dodi" is on the California rapper's debut album 'Doggystyle.' The song also features a guest appearance from vocalist Nancy Fletcher. Many have covered “La Di Da Di,” but Snoop's version of the New York classic is arguably one of the best covers in hip-hop history.

The name of this track seemed to mirror Snoop's life at the time. Before releasing "Murder Was The Case," the 'Doggystyle' artist was charged with the murder of a gang member named Philip Woldemariam. Snoop didn't pull the trigger but he was driving the Jeep when his bodyguard McKinley Lee pulled up on Woldemariam and shot him. Lee and Snoop were both charged with murder and freed on bail on Death Row's bill. In 1996, both Lee and Snoop were found not guilty. The line "murder was the case" comes from a Snoop Dogg verse on the Dr. Dre song "Lil' Ghetto Boy," which was released on Dre's debut solo album 'The Chronic' about a year earlier. 
Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa co-starred in the film 'Mac &amp; Devin Go to High School' also decided to make a song after their "Black &amp; Yellow" collaboration. Snoop told MTV News how the song came together: "[Bruno Mars] sent me the music and I played the music for Wiz and he loved it and we came together," he said. "That's what we do: We make good music. If you've got a great idea, which was started by Bruno, and me and Wiz, we take it to the next level, gave it back to Bruno. He tightened up the edges, and now it's a complete situation." "Young, Wild, and Free" was nominated for "Best Rap Song" at the 55th Grammy Awards. The song is currently six-times platinum status with the RIAA.

"Still D.R.E." is a hip-hop classic and one of Dr. Dre's best-produced and most memorable beats. Snoop Dogg raps on this track with Dre (which was written by Jay-Z). Hov flew to L.A. and wrote the song in 30 minutes. He told Lebron James and Maverick Carter on their HBO show 'The Shop' that he wrote the rhymes as if he were them. "You gotta have like somewhat of a reverence for them, the music they were making," he said. "'The Chronic' and all of that. In order for me to really nail the essence of Dre and Snoop, it had to be like a studied reverence of what they were doing." "Still D.R.E." peaked at No. 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2000. In the week after Dr. Dre's and Snoop Dogg's Super Bowl performance, it re-entered the chart at No. 23. The song was nominated for "Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group" at the 42nd Grammy Awards.

You can't think of Snoop Dogg and not think about his '93 classic hit "Gin and Juice." "Gin and Juice" is featured on Snoop's debut album 'Doggystyle' which was produced by Dr. Dre. "Gin And Juice" was Snoop Dogg's second single, but the rapper had gotten a headstart and began establishing himself as an artist by featuring in several songs on Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic.' Snoop talked about the origin of the song per HipHopHero: "Gin and juice was the choice of drink for a young playa. 1991, 1992, you didn't really have a lot of money, you go get that gin. When it came time to make the record, 'Doggystyle', that was my thing: Every day I would come to the studio with my bottle of gin and juice in it, and Dre would have a big-a-- milk jug full of gin and juice. We were in the studio one day and someone was singing that Slave song, 'Watching You.' We flipped it into 'Rollin' down the street, smokin indo, sippin' on gin and juice,' and made it happen from there." The song was nominated for "Best Rap Song" at the 37th Grammy Awards.
