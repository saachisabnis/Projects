A question that Bobby Bones and Lunchbox get asked a lot is how they got their “stage names.”  
Lunchbox got his name because in the 3rd grade he won a Superman lunchbox from Wal-Mart to use at school, but his mom told him no. He put it under his shirt to try and take it and as they were about to leave the store, she asked if there was something under his shirt. He said no but when she checked and saw the lunchbox, he claimed he had no idea how it got there. She made him return it to the manager and they’ve made fun of him for it ever since.  
Bones got his when he was 17 and begged for a job at a radio station. They wouldn’t hire him for on-air and just to clean and switch out Rick D’s Top 40 on Sundays. Before his first shift, they fired somebody and told him it was his chance to go on-air, but he couldn’t use his real name and could either go by Bobby Z or Bobby Bones. He thought they were both stupid, but he chose Bones because it sounded more like a pirate or human. He tried to change it a few times but was always connected to the last place.  
They also shared the origin story of where some other famous stage names came from!
