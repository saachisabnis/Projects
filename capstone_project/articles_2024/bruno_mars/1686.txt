(Gray News) - Miley Cyrus is being sued in a new lawsuit over the alleged similarities between her hit song ”Flowers” and Bruno Mars’ song “When I Was Your Man.”
According to the lawsuit, Tempo Music Investments, which owns a share of the copyright in Mars’ hit, is suing Cyrus for copyright infringement.
Tempo Music alleges many “recognized the striking similarities” between the two songs.
The lawsuit also said that “Flowers” “duplicates numerous melodic, harmonic, and lyrical elements” of Mars’ track, People reported. 
“It is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that ‘Flowers’ would not exist without ‘When I Was Your Man,’’ the documents state.
Songwriters Gregory Hein and Michael Pollock, who co-wrote the song with Cyrus, Sony Music Publishing, and distributors of the song, including Apple, Live Nation and Amazon, were also named in the complaint
Mars is not named as a plaintiff in the filing.
Tempo Music Investments wants Cyrus and the defendants listed in the suit to stop reproducing, distributing or publicly performing “Flowers.”
The company is also seeking damages, but the amount is yet to be determined. 
“Flowers” earned Cyrus her very first Grammy when she won for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2024 awards show.
