Beyoncé’s NFL appearances are already legendary, including her 2013 Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where she reunited with Destiny’s Child in a performance that became the second-most-watched halftime show of its time. She returned in 2016 for Super Bowl 50, joining Coldplay and Bruno Mars in a show watched by 115.5 million viewers.
The Netflix Christmas Gameday begins a new holiday tradition, with the streaming platform announcing NFL games for 2025 and 2026. The first game will feature the Kansas City Chiefs facing the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 PM ET, followed by the Texans-Ravens matchup.
While details of Beyoncé’s performance remain secret, fans can expect appearances from special guests featured on COWBOY CARTER. The event will be available to stream globally on Netflix, while local broadcasts and NFL+ will carry the games in the competing team cities.
With Netflix, the NFL, and Beyoncé joining forces, this Christmas promises an unforgettable blend of sports and entertainment.
