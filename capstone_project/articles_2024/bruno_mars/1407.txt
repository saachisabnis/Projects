Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden had a sweet seven-word message to her celebrity partner JB Gill ahead of Saturday's live show.
Professional dancer Lauren Oakley, who currently does not have a celebrity pairing on this year's series of the BBC One dance competition, has stepped in to dance with JLS star JB, 37, after Amy, 34, fell ill during filming last weekend.
Amy is said to be "doing much better" after a health scare forced her to miss Sunday's results programme after being taken to hospital and she has skipped this week of the competition to recover.
During Saturday's episode, which is icons themed in a BBC One show first, the remaining 10 celebrities and their professional dance partners will perform a routine accompanied by a track from a legendary singer. For the icons week, JB and Lauren, 33, will perform a couple's choice to a medley of Bruno Mars.
Taking to Instagram ahead of their performance, Amy shared her support for the duo and said in a sweet seven-word message: "I’m going to be your biggest cheerleader!"
The message read in full: "Wishing these two the absolute best of luck tonight! I’m going to be your biggest cheerleader! @jbgill it says everything how you’ve been able to adapt to a new professional, produce such a great number ( so excited for everyone to see) whilst supporting me! I’m so lucky! You’re a STAR! I know what tonight means to you! Thank you!
"@laurenmayoakley thank you, I knew Jay would be in safe hands and have a fabulous time with you! You know I’ve always adored your dancing since I ran up to you in Blackpool tower at 8 years old to tell you! Thank you darling!
"@lizzie.gough you for choreographing such a brilliant routine! LOVE IT! Thank you! Also a big thank you for all the love and support I’ve received this past week. So grateful and certainly helped! Now tune into the first ever ICONS week on strictly!"
On Monday, a Strictly spokesperson said: "Amy Dowden MBE is doing much better and the Strictly family send her love and wish her well.
"She is delighted that fellow professional dancer Lauren Oakley is able to step in for rehearsals and to perform in Saturday's show for JB Gill's couple's choice dance. We are all hopeful that Amy will be back to dance with JB next week."
This year the dancer returned to competing on the show after undergoing treatment for stage three breast cancer, including having a mastectomy and chemotherapy. In February, Amy revealed that tests showed she has "no evidence of disease".
Strictly Come Dancing continues this Saturday on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.
