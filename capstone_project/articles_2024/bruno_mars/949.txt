Some are friendly giants, others are tiny companions, but all of them want the same thing – a 'furever home' and a family that loves them.
Some of the dogs at the centre are called 'underdogs', which means they have been at Dogs Trust for six months or more, are sometimes overlooked, may need extra training, ongoing vet treatment, or require a home with no children or other dogs.
Here are all of the four-legged friends at Shrewsbury waiting to be rehomed by a caring new owner.
