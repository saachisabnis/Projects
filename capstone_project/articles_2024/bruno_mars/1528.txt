Lady Gaga arrived at this year's Venice Film Festival in style with fiancé Michael Polansky on Monday (September 2), giving Little Monsters present at the event an exclusive look at her massive diamond engagement ring. 
The A Star is Born standout and her beau shared a sweet kiss at they exited their vehicle ahead of the premiere of Gaga's highly-anticipated film, Joker: Folie à Deux, in the breathtaking Italian city. 
The icon stunned in a black and white polka dot dress complete with matching sunglasses as she walked arm-in-arm with Polansky, wearing a black jacket with sneakers that complemented the look. Gaga beamed from ear-to-ear aside her plus one, and even gave festival-goers a not-so-subtle peek at her giant wedding hardware. A handful of photos depict the ravishing 38-year-old and her fiancé smiling as they make their way around the film festival. The "Poker Face" artist even posed with her engagement ring to her chest, clearly showing off the precious symbol of she and Polansky's undying love and unity. 
In addition to new photos of the ring, the GRAMMY award-winning hitmaker also debuted her return to platinum blonde locks following a brief brunette break during the promotion of she and Bruno Mars' new single, "Die With A Smile," released last month. 
The "Bad Romance" lyricist confirmed her engagement to Polansky during the 2024 Paris Olympics in July upon meeting French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, introducing her partner as her "fiancé" following months of speculation. 
Gaga is gearing up for the release of her forthcoming film, Joker: Folie à Deux, out this fall, as she continues to craft her seventh studio album, LG7.
