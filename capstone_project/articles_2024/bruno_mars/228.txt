Musicians and Donald Trump have a fraught relationship. From ordering him to stop playing their music to calling out his politics, some of the highest-profile artists in the world have aligned themselves against the former president, who is campaigning in the 2024 election against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.
While several prominent singers have been calling out Trump as long ago as 1989, when he was a promoter for the Rolling Stones (Keith Richards was not a fan), his time as president prompted many more to criticise him at shows, write protest songs about him, or mock him from their social media accounts.
From his 2016 presidential campaign to his bid in the 2024 election, here’s an extensive timeline of some of the most notable moments involving Trump and the music industry. 
After months of statements expressing the Rolling Stones’ distaste at Trump using their music at his rallies, frontman Mick Jagger explains why they are unable to stop him from doing it.
“When you appear in America… if you’re in a public place like Madison Square Garden or a theatre, you can play any music you want, and you can’t be stopped,” he says.
Trump struggles to find artists willing to perform at his inauguration. 
After a report that his representatives are looking for LBGT musicians, Elton John – who commented, when Trump used ‘Tiny Dancer’ in his campaign, “I’m not a Republican in a million years” – swiftly rules himself out. On a potential inauguration performance, he quips: “Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent?”
Andrea Bocelli reportedly backs out of a performance after being approached by Trump, who is a huge fan and once booked Bocelli to perform at a private party at his Florida club in 2010, amid uproar from fans.
With Trump’s inauguration looming ever closer, his team become increasingly desperate to book some actual “names”, following his promise of “plenty of movie and entertainment stars”.
There are plenty of artists who have said no by now, including Charlotte Church, Rebecca Ferguson, Ice T, Elton John, the Dixie Chicks, Adam Lambert, and a Bruce Springsteen tribute band. Jennifer Holliday pulls out after a backlash from her LGBT fanbase.
Singer and actor John Legend has a suggestion for why Trump is struggling. “Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate,” he says. “We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that’s preaching division and hate and bigotry, it’s unlikely that he’ll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.”
Charlotte Church is even more blunt, criticising Trump’s team for even daring to ask her: “A simple internet search would show I think you’re a tyrant,” she writes on Twitter.
Rebecca Ferguson says she will perform on the condition that she sings “Strange Fruit” – the protest poem against racism that was popularised by Billie Holliday. For some reason, Trump’s team don’t take Ferguson up on the offer.
Trump eventually manages to get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Jackie Evancho (an America’s Got Talent finalist), 3 Doors Down and Jon Voight to appear at the ceremony.
Nancy Sinatra responds to Trump having her father’s song “My Way” performed at the ceremony by commenting: “Just remember the first line of the song”. The “Bang Bang” singer is referring to the line: “And now, the end is near.”
By this time, several artists have begun to release protest songs against Trump including Gorillaz, who break a six-year absence with a new anti-Trump song, “Hallelujah Money”. 
Lily Allen makes a playlist for Trump, which includes her own song “F*** You”, Rihanna’s track “Russian Roulette”, and Green Day’s “American Idiot”.
Depeche Mode return with their first new music in four years: a politically charged track titled “Where’s the Revolution” that appears to criticise the US for electing Trump as president. Singer Dave Gahan performs blistering lyrics including the line: “Who’s making your decisions? You or your religion? / Your government, your countries? You patriotic junkies.”
The 59th Grammy awards is one of the most political in the music award ceremony’s history, and features anti-Trump statements from the likes of Highly Suspect, Jennifer Lopez, Paris Jackson, Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest and Katy Perry.
Snoop Dogg causes uproar with his music video for “Lavender”, which shows an actor dressed as Trump with a clown face.
At the video’s climax, the clown Trump is held at gunpoint, and Snoop pulls the trigger to reveal a red flag with the word “BANG” written on it.
The rapper says of the video: “The whole world is clownin’ around, and [the] concept is so right on point with the art direction and the reality, because if you really look at some of these mother***ers, they are clowns.”
The president’s lawyer says he is “shocked” by the video and demands an apology from Snoop.
In an interview with The Independent, John Legend speaks about Trump’s election and suggests an interesting reason for why artists are less vocal about politics than they were in previous decades.
Bruce Springsteen releases a new protest song "That's What Makes Us Great" that brands Trump as a “con man”. The song includes the lyrics: “Don’t tell me a lie, and sell it as fact / I’ve been down that road before, and I ain’t going back.”
Rapper Nas writes an emotional open letter to Trump which says, “We all know a racist is in office.”
“Whatever president may be in office doesn’t affect my work directly,” he continues. “The way he affects people is what affects me. I observe what’s going on and that goes into my creative process. The person himself, I’m not caught up with. I don’t even have time for Trump or Pence. I don’t give a f***.”
John Legend argues that Trump’s attacks on other public figures is an example of psychological projection and blame-shifting.
The outspoken artist brands the US president an “embarrassment” to America and lambasts his approval rating, which has dropped to 34 per cent, as a prestigious polling site also deems him more unpopular than any other president in the history of modern polling.
Snoop Dogg takes aim at Trump in a new track titled “Make America Crip Again”, an obvious take on Trump’s trademark campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”.
In the opening lines Snoop says: “The president says he wants to make America great again. F*** that s**t, we’re going to make America crip again.”
Macklemore leads chants of “F*** Donald Trump” at a concert in Arizona and performs his YG collaboration, “F*** Donald Trump Part 2”, which features the lyric: “How did he make it this far? How the f*** did it begin? / A Trump rally sounds like Hitler and Berlin.”
Frank Sinatra’s former manager releases a book revealing the legendary singer once told Trump to “go f*** yourself” in 1990 after being told by the former business magnate, who was opening his casino in Atlantic City, that his performance costs were “a little rich”.
Morrissey causes controversy in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel with his comments on Trump. Asked whether he would push a button that would cause the president to “drop dead”, he answers: “I would, for the safety of the human race… I think he’s a terrible, terrible scourge.” The former Smiths singer then attempts to deny making the remark, which prompts Der Spiegel to reveal the full audio of the interview, revealing he did in fact make the comment.

Bruce Springsteen condemns Trump’s border policy in a break from script during a show at New York’s Walter Kerr Theatre, branding the treatment of families “inhumane” and performing his 1995 protest song “The Ghost of Tom Joad”.
Selena Gomez speaks out over the US-Mexico border situation. The singer and actress, who is Mexican-American and was born in Texas, says Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy is “extremely disheartening” and that it “definitely has been affecting so many people who are close to me”.
Ahead of Trump’s visit to the UK, “American Idiot” by Green Day hits the charts, becoming the No 1 single on Amazon and also appearing on the iTunes Top 10, following a fan campaign.
Trump’s 4 July celebrations are something of a disaster. Where Obama hosted arena acts including Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars, Janelle Monae and The Killers, Trump manages to get two American Idol finalists, and classical pianist Lola Astanova.
The 1975 reference Trump in their new song “Love It If We Made It” by quoting his infamous comments in the lyrics: “Immigration liberal kitsch, kneeling on a pitch, ‘I moved on her like a bitch!!’” and “Excited to be indicted, unrequited, house with seven pools, ‘thank you Kanye, very cool’.”

“I have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country,” she writes on Instagram.

The Rolling Stones threaten Trump with legal action for using their songs at his rallies despite repeat cease-and-desist directives.

The estate of the late Irish artist Sinead O’Connor opposes Trump’s use of her cover of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” at a rally, explaining: “It is no exaggeration to say that Sinead would have been disgusted, hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way.”
