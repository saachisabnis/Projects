No one bother me, I'm busy listening to this all day. 
Lady Gaga is so back. I mean, she was already back with her Joker: Folie à Deux album and that Bruno Mars collab, but she just released the first official song off of LG7. I'll give you a moment to bask in "Disease:"
It's perfect / absolutely no notes.
LG7 is due out in February, and Gaga told Vogue re: the album's vibe that “There’s a lot of pain associated with this adventure. And when I start to explore that pain it can bring out another side to my artistry. When I’m here at this studio [Rick Rubin’s Shangri-La], I’m relaxed and I am able to face my demons and what’s remarkable is… that’s the music. I’m able to hear it back.”
She also noted that her fiancé Michael Polansky encouraged her to make a pop album, saying “Michael is the person who told me to make a new pop record. He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music.'" Meanwhile, he told the mag that "Like anyone would do for the person they love, I encouraged her to lean in to the joy of it. On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her; I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy."
Can't wait for LG7! 'Til then, go ahead and memorize the lyrics to "Disease" (via Genius) if you haven't already:
