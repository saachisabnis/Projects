	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

	“APT.” rules the Global 200 with 147.7 million streams (down 1%) and 18,000 sold (up 4%) worldwide Dec. 6-12. The hit now claims eight of the top nine global streaming weeks among songs released in 2024:

	Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200. Released in 1994, the song has spent a record 18 weeks at No. 1 dating to the chart’s start (five each over the 2023 and 2022 holidays and four in both the 2021 and 2020 holiday seasons).

	Four other carols rank in the Global 200’s top 10: Wham’s “Last Christmas” (11-4), Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” (6-5), Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” (8-6) and Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me” (13-10). The songs have hit respective Nos. 2, 2, 4 and 5 highs.

	










	Plus, Lady Gaga and Mars’ “Die With a Smile” dips 3-4 on the Global 200, following eight weeks at No. 1, the most for any song this year, beginning in September. It drew 120.6 million streams (up 5%) worldwide in the latest tracking frame and has tallied over 100 million streams globally in each of the last 15 weeks, the longest such streak since the chart began.

	“APT.” concurrently tops Global Excl. U.S. with 129.9 million streams (down 2%) and 12,000 sold (down 3%) outside the U.S. Dec. 6-12.

	“Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S.. following eight weeks at No. 1 starting in September; Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” repeats at No. 3, having spent a record-tying 13 weeks at No. 1; Wham’s “Last Christmas” keeps at No. 4, after reaching No. 2; and Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” lifts 6-5, following three weeks at No. 1 in August.

	ROSÉ’s “Toxic Till the End” debuts at No. 6 on Global Excl. U.S. with 50.4 million streams and 4,000 sold outside the U.S. The BLACKPINK member achieves her third solo top 10 on the chart; the quartet and members Jennie and LISA as soloists have each notched four top 10s, while the act’s Jisoo has scored one top 10 solo.

	Meanwhile, three more holiday hits make sleigh rides through Global Excl. U.S. top 10: Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” (10-8); Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” (16-9); and Sia’s “Snowman” (12-10). The songs have reached highs of Nos. 3, 5 and 4, respectively.

	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Dec. 21, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Dec. 17. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard’s subscription-based service.
