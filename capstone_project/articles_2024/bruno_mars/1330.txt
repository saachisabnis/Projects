Mariah Carey will show Las Vegas where she belongs — for a third time — with the debut of The Celebration of Mimi, April 12 through April 27 at Dolby Live in Park MGM. The “exclusive engagement” (April 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26 and 27) toasts the 19th anniversary of The Emancipation of Mimi (released on April 12, 2005).

	A statement shared with Billboard states that “the Las Vegas shows will feature fan favorites from that album as well as other hits from her unparalleled illustrious career.” The Emancipation of Mimi, with hits such as “We Belong Together” and “Shake It Off,” was one of the top-selling albums of its year and is known within her catalog as the “comeback album.”Making another comeback — this time on the Strip — The Celebration of Mimi engagement, backed by Live Nation and MGM Resorts, follows Carey’s first two residencies at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, #1 to Infinity (2015-2017) and The Butterfly Returns (2018-2020). Infinity was a chronological performance of her 18 No. 1 hits, starting with 1990’s “Vision of Love” and ending with 2008’s “Touch My Body.” While that show focused on Carey the entertainer, “Butterfly” capitalized on Carey the singer with a powerful 23-song set list of big hits, surprises and her own personal favorites. Since 2020, Carey has mostly performed and toured with her holiday music. Carey got her break in 1990 with the smash hit “Vision of Love” and since sold more than 200 million albums with 19 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 singles. Just days ago the five-octave-range singer accepted the Global Impact Award during the Recording Academy Honors presented by the Black Music Collective.Tickets will go on sale to the public Saturday, Feb. 10 for April 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26 and 27. Limited to only eight dates, it seems as if Carey is taking a page from Kelly Clarkson’s Las Vegas strategy book. Last year, Clarkson announced a 10-date run of Chemistry. All shows sold out. Since then, she has picked select weekends to return including New Years and Super Bowl. With this being the third chapter in her Las Vegas legacy, the chances of more dates coming down the line seem probable.Carey’s announcement follows last week’s news that Mexican group Los Bukis will perform the Strip’s first-ever full Latin and Spanish-language residency, launching May 3 at Dolby Live at Park MGM. The theater is also home to Bruno Mars, Maroon 5 and Lady Gaga.
