Once you hear this re-cooked version of Def Leppard's “Pour Some Sugar On Me” you may never go back.
Recently Postmodern Jukebox posted their take on Def Leppard's classic rock hit “Pour Some Sugar On Me”...and it is awesome!
If you aren't aware of what Post Modern Jukebox is or does, here is how they explain...
“When New York City pianist Scott Bradlee created Postmodern Jukebox out of a basement in Queens in 2011, his goal was simple: to remake the pop hits of today into the classic sounds of the legends of yesterday. Miley Cyrus became The Platters. Bruno Mars became Frank Sinatra. The Spice Girls became The Andrews Sisters. Guns ’n’ Roses became Bessie Smith.”
So check this out...this, of course is Def Leppard's monster 1987 rock hit “Pour Some Sugar On Me”...
Now...turn your speakers all the way up and get a kick outta how Postmodern Jukebox reimagined the jam!...
Pretty darn awesome, right!?
