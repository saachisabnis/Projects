Miley Cyrus is facing a legal battle over her smash hit song “Flowers.” The lawsuit, filed on Monday, September 16, in Los Angeles by Tempo Music Investments, claims that Miley and her co-writers, Gregory Hein and Michael Pollack, copied elements of Bruno Mars’ 2013 hit single “When I Was Your Man” when they created “Flowers.”
The suit alleges that “Flowers” includes several key components of Mars’ song without authorization, sparking controversy over the similarities between the two tracks. While Bruno Mars himself, as well as his co-writers Ari Levine and Andrew Wyatt, are not named as plaintiffs, the lawsuit is being brought by Tempo Music, which owns part of the U.S. copyright to the Mars track, specifically through co-writer Philip Lawrence’s contribution.
According to Rolling Stone, the lawsuit points to multiple musical similarities between “Flowers” and “When I Was Your Man.” Tempo claims that these elements include “melodic, harmonic, and lyrical” components, such as the vocal pitch design in the verse, connecting bass lines, parts of the chorus, and even the chord progressions. Tempo’s legal team argues that Miley’s song would not have existed without borrowing from the Bruno Mars hit.
The complaint emphasizes the opening vocal line of “Flowers,” asserting that it mirrors the structure and melody of “When I Was Your Man.” According to the lawsuit, “It is undeniable based on the combination and number of similarities between the two recordings that ‘Flowers’ would not exist without ‘When I Was Your Man.’”
Interestingly, co-writer Michael Pollack remained silent when asked about the similarity between the two songs during a March 2023 interview with Billboard. His refusal to comment on the matter has only added fuel to the fire. Moreover, in a separate Billboard interview, Philip Lawrence, one of the original co-writers of “When I Was Your Man,” mentioned that the song had been partly inspired by the legendary Billy Joel’s artistry.
“Flowers” was a massive commercial success for Miley Cyrus, dominating charts worldwide and becoming a fan favorite almost immediately after its release. The song has been hailed as an anthem of self-empowerment, with its lyrics about independence and personal growth resonating with listeners globally. However, Tempo’s lawsuit claims that the song’s success was built on a foundation that closely mirrors “When I Was Your Man.”
In addition to Miley Cyrus and her co-writers, the lawsuit names several other defendants, including Sony Music Publishing, Apple, Target, and Walmart. These companies are being sued for their roles in distributing “Flowers,” allegedly profiting from the unauthorized use of elements from the Bruno Mars hit.
While Miley has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit, it is expected that her legal team will put up a strong defense against the allegations. The lawsuit is seeking damages in an amount to be determined at trial, or a maximum of $150,000 per infringement.
