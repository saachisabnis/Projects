Here’s what’s planned this week in Pahrump.
Sadly, it’s time to remove the whimsical antlers and red nose from your vehicle, but the fun’s not over yet. You still have pets to tranquilize prior to New Year’s Eve pyrotechnics, and kids to entertain who do not return to school until January 6th.
Choose from early start/end and traditional evening parties about town on Tuesday evening, the last night of 2024. Live entertainment includes Mark Aston at the Pahrump Nugget, or Johnny & Treasure at Lakeside Casino. Select your vibe to ring in 2025 by consulting the detailed listing under December 31st.
Light up the skies this long holiday weekend. The Pahrump Fireworks Safety Site is open from 7 to 11 p.m. Saturday December 28th through New Year’s Eve. The site is located at 3770 Fox Ave., at the corner of Fox Avenue and Gamebird Road.
