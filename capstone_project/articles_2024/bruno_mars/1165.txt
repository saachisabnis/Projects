How well do the winners at the Grammy Awards align with Billboard chart success? Perhaps not surprisingly, very closely — especially when it comes to trophy recipients reaching the top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart and the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart.

Billboard looks at the crossroads of Recording Academy and commercial success in two of the most prominent Grammy categories — album of the year and record of the year — over the last 67 years, from the first awards presented in 1959, a year after the Hot 100 launched and three years after the Billboard 200 began – through music’s latest biggest night in 2025.

	Of the 67 album of the year winners, 64 — or 96% — have hit the Billboard 200’s top 10 (two of which did so for the first time following their Grammy victories). Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, the 2025 winner, after leading for two weeks, following Taylor Swift’s Midnights, which reigned for six weeks. A year before that, Harry Styles’ fellow No. 1 Harry’s House won the award.

	Three years ago, Jon Batiste’s victory with We Are contrasted that sharp trend, and halted a run of 26 top 10s winning consecutively since 1996 – the longest streak all-time. Still, We Are surged back onto the April 16, 2022-dated Billboard 200 at a new No. 25 high; it previously spent a week on the survey, at No. 86, in April 2021. The two previous winning sets not to have hit the top 10: Tony Bennett’s MTV Unplugged, which rose to No. 48 after its 1995 win (after it had reached No. 69 before that year’s ceremony), and Glen Campbell’s By the Time I Get to Phoenix, which reached its No. 15 peak ahead of its win in 1969.

	Historically, 69% of all winners (46 of 67) have led the list.

	Here’s a recap of how all album of the year Grammy Award winners have performed on the Billboard 200. (Album of the year is awarded to artist[s] and featured artist[s], songwriter[s] of new material, producer[s], recording engineer[s], mixer[s] and mastering engineer[s].)

	Of the 67 record of the year winners, 56 — or 84% — have hit the Hot 100’s top 10 (one of which did so for the first time following its Grammy coronation). Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” continues that trend, as 16 winners in a row since 2010 have reached the top 10, the second-longest streak, after a 23-year run in 1965-87.

	Historically, 55% of all winners (37 of 67) have topped the tally, with “Not Like Us” likewise upping that share.

	Here’s a rundown of how all record of the year Grammy Award winners have fared on the Hot 100. (Record of the year is awarded to artist/producer[s], recording engineer[s] and/or mixer[s] and mastering engineer[s], if other than artist.)
