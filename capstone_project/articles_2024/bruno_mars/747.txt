Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars released their hit duet “Die With a Smile” as a standalone single, but now Gaga says it’s found an important place on her upcoming album, due out next year.
Asked by the Los Angeles Times whether the song is “connected” to her album, Gaga says, “Absolutely. ‘Die With a Smile’ is on my record — it’s a huge part of my album. It was like this missing piece. The record is full of my love of music — so many different genres, so many different styles, so many different dreams. It leaps around genre in a way that’s almost corrupt. And it ends with love.”
“That’s the answer to all the chaos in my life … I find peace with love,” says Gaga, who got engaged in April. “Every song that I wrote, I just kept getting kind of swept away in these different dreams I was having about the past — almost like a recollection of all these bad decisions that I made in my life. But it ends in this very happy place.”
Gaga also spoke about headlining Coachella in 2025. While she stepped in for a pregnant Beyoncé at the festival in 2017, she says she’s eager to go back to show everyone what she can really do.
“I only had two weeks [to prepare for the show]. And so to design a stage, to have it made, all of those things — I didn’t have the time to totally do what I really wanted to do,” she says of her 2017 Coachella set.
“I love music. I love performing. I love music fans … so I did it, and I loved it,” she continues. “But you know when you have a vision in your mind of how you want to do something? It’s time to make it happen.”
