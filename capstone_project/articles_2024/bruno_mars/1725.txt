	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

	“APT.” tops the Global 200 for a sixth week with 160.6 million streams (up 21% week-over-week) and 20,000 sold (up 49%) worldwide Nov. 22-28. The duet debuted with 224.5 million global streams and logged 207.5 million in its second frame, becoming the first title since the chart started to have amassed at least 200 million streams globally in multiple weeks.

	“APT.” also now boasts six of the top seven streaming weeks on the Global 200 among songs released in 2024:

	Lady Gaga and Mars’ “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200, following eight weeks at No. 1, the most for any song this year, beginning in September. It drew 115.7 million streams (up 1%) worldwide Nov. 22-28 and has tallied over 100 million streams globally in each of the last 13 weeks, the longest such streak since the chart began.

	










Lamar debuts five songs in the Global 200’s top 10, all from his album GNX, which blasts in at No. 1 on the U.S.-based Billboard 200: “Squabble Up” (No. 3; 82.6 million streams), “Luther,” with SZA (No. 4; 78.1 million), “TV Off,” featuring Lefty Gunplay (No. 5; 74.9 million), “Wacced Out Murals” (No. 6; 60.9 million) and “Hey Now,” featuring Dody6 (No. 10; 48.8 million). Lamar ups his total to 11 top 10s since the Global 200 began. SZA adds her seventh top 10, while Lefty Gunplay and Dody6 each earn their first. (“Luther” samples Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn’s 1982 cover of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s 1967 single “If This World Were Mine.”)

	“APT.” concurrently commands Global Excl. U.S. for a sixth week, with 141 million streams (up 20%) and 13,000 sold (up 44%) outside the U.S. Nov. 22-28.

	“Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S. following eight weeks at No. 1 starting in September; Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” keeps at No. 3, after three weeks at No. 1 beginning in August; and Gracie Abrams’ “That’s So True” rises 5-4 for a new high.

	Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” sleigh-rides 14-5 on Global Excl. U.S, with 38.1 million streams (up 33%) and 2,000 sold (up 40%) outside the U.S. The modern Yuletide classic, originally released in 1994, has spent 13 weeks at No. 1 dating to the chart’s start, tying Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” (2023) and Harry Styles’ “As It Was” (2022) for the most frames on top. The carol holds at No. 9 on the Global 200, where it has spent a record 18 weeks at No. 1.

	










	Three songs debut in the Global Excl. U.S. top 10, led by Lamar’s “Luther” (34.1 million streams outside the U.S.) It’s the rapper’s fourth top 10 on the chart and SZA’s third.

	G-DRAGON’s “Home Sweet Home,” featuring TAEYANG and DAESUNG, opens at No. 7 on Global Excl. U.S. with 29.2 million streams and 8,000 sold outside the U.S. The track brings together the three members of BIGBANG, which as a group hit No. 3 on the chart with “Still Life” in April 2022. G-DRAGON and DAESUNG each reach the top 10 as soloists for the first time, while TAEYANG previously ranked in the region with “Vibe,” featuring Jimin (No. 9, 2023).

	Plus, Stromae and Pomme’s “Ma Meilleure Ennemie” debuts at No. 8 on Global Excl. U.S. with 32.3 million streams and 1,000 sold outside the U.S. Each act charts in the top 10 for the first time with the song from the second-season soundtrack to the Netflix animated series Arcane: League of Legends.
