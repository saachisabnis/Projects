Oakley, who will be standing in for Amy this week, will join JB for a medley of Bruno Mars hits as part of the show’s upcoming Icons-themed week.
The incident marks an unprecedented turn for the series, as no professional dancer has ever had to withdraw due to health concerns in the show’s 20-year history.
The 33-year-old dancer, from Caerphilly, South Wales, has a fan favorite on the hit BBC dance competition since she joined the show in 2017.
The star has suffered from a series of health issues including a diagnosis of stage three breast cancer in May 2023. She underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and even dealt with a clot on her lung post-treatment, a sequence of challenges she described as a "nightmare."
After finishing her treatments and receiving the all-clear earlier this year, she returned to the show, telling fans: “The sun is shining – and I certainly can’t wait for Spring.”
Strictly Come Dancing airs on Saturdays from 6.20pm on BBC One or catch up on BBC iPlayer.
