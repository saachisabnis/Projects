It was all about the fanny when The Rock appeared on The Drew Barrymore Show.
During an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was surprised to see that Drew dressed up as him, as she recreated his classic look from the picture with the fanny pack. He gave her a custom “Mama Drew” fanny pack, and she gave him one as well. They then played a game where they pulled questions out of fanny packs.
In one highlight, The Rock was asked to name his go-to sing for shaking his fanny. He named “Versace on the Floor” by Bruno Mars.
“The Great One” was then asked to name the best compliment he had gotten about his fanny. He said that it was “commensurate” with his nickname of The Rock.
