Grammy-winning DJ and producer Cedric Gervais teamed up with Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Nile Rodgers, to deliver a modern twist on the iconic 1979 Sister Sledge anthem “We Are Family.” 
Released on September 27, 2024, this reimagined track pays homage to the original’s timeless message of unity while infusing it with a fresh energy that resonates with the global dancefloors of today.
The collaboration, released through Armada Music, masterfully blends Gervais’ big-room house style with Rodgers’ signature funk-driven grooves. Lush melodies, shimmering synths, and pulsing basslines complement Rodgers’ unmistakable guitar rhythms, creating a seamless fusion of soulful funk and cutting-edge house music. The result is a dancefloor anthem that is both nostalgic and contemporary.
Speaking about the track, Gervais shared his enthusiasm for working with Rodgers again, following their successful 2020 reinterpretation of Everybody Dance. 
“We recreated We Are Family at NightBird Studio in Los Angeles, and Nile’s passion for music was infectious,” Gervais said. “This song has such a positive, unifying message, and I can’t wait for the world to hear it.”
Rodgers echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the song’s enduring relevance. “Each year, “We Are Family” and its message grow more powerful,” he said. “In a time when the world needs hope, this reinterpretation aims to bring joy and celebrate our shared humanity.”
This collaboration comes on the heels of Gervais’ summer hit Switch with David Guetta and highlights his knack for combining modern house music with classic inspirations. 
As one of the most sought-after house DJs, Gervais boasts a decorated career, including his iconic Grammy-winning remix of Lana Del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness” and multiple chart-topping releases. 
With residencies in Miami, New York, and Las Vegas, as well as sellout tours worldwide, his influence in electronic music remains undeniable.
The release of We Are Family reaffirms the timeless nature of its message. Beyond the music, the track serves as a reminder of the power of unity across cultures, communities, and generations. With its sleek production and infectious energy, this collaboration between Gervais and Rodgers is destined to become a staple on global dancefloors.
Fans can catch Cedric Gervais on tour in the coming months, with stops in cities like Las Vegas, Miami, and Orlando, where his electrifying performances continue to captivate audiences. 
Whether through live sets or studio collaborations, Gervais and Rodgers prove that their music together remains a universal language of connection and joy.
I got a chance to talk with Gervais about “We Are Family,” working with Nile Rodgers, and much more. Check it out below!
PD: Congratulations on “We Are Family!” This isn’t your first collaboration with Rodgers, how did you two decide to work together again? 
Well we had an amazing success with “Everybody Dance,” that we decided to do this other amazing song with a very powerful message.
