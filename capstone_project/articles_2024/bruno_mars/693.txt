Grammy-winning singer Lucky Daye is giving fans a preview into his forthcoming album with the release of “HERicane.”
Produced by D’Mile, the New Orleans crooner details his infatuation for his love interest.
“I’ll take you to the top floor, baby / If you want it, don’t let me go, hold on, just ride,” he sings. “What you wanna do? I/ ‘ll drive you through midnight / Let it rain, baby, rain / Till we slide into the heart of hurricane.”
Daye first teased the “Hericane” track in March. He posted a video of him in a car playing a snippet of the song.
The New Orleans native shared the news Wednesday (April 3) on Instagram, along with a pre-save link.

“HERicane” is the follow-up to last year’s single, “That’s You“ co-produced by D’Mile and Bruno Mars. Both “Hericane” and “That’s You” are expected to appear on Daye’s forthcoming third studio album. 
In a recent interview on 105.3 R&B, Lucky detailed his upcoming album, saying that his upcoming project will be more happy in tone, after his previous two album were comprised of love songs and break-up ballads.
“It’s about being grounded in chaos,” Lucky said. “Whether it’s a relationship, or whether it’s the industry it’s all about not being afraid to be yourself, not being afraid to spread your wings.”
