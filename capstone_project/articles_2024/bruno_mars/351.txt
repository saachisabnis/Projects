James Tokioka, Director of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, on behalf of Gov. Josh Green and the Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi presented Underwood with ceremonial proclamations.
The proclamations were issued in recognition of Underwood's incredible career achievements, cultural and societal contributions, and her first-ever performances in Hawaii today and tomorrow.
Concert promoter Rick Bartalini said, "History has been made with Carrie becoming the first artist to receive ceremonial proclamations from both the state and city. She is in prestigious company of entertainers that have been previously honored by either the mayor or the governor in this manner, including Elvis Presley, Janet Jackson, Bruno Mars and Diana Ross."
Both proclamations were presented to Underwood at an official ceremony, stating in part, "With heartfelt aloha, we thank her for bringing her live show to Hawaii and fulfilling the dreams of thousands of fans who have eagerly awaited this opportunity. Carrie Underwood embodies the aloha spirit through her talent, love  and genuine care and compassion for others."
The state proclamation said in part, "Your music, your kindness, your remarkable journey and your unwavering dedication to making the world a better place have touched countless hearts here in Hawaii. We are truly blessed to have you bring your extraordinary live experience to the people of Hawaii for the very first time. Your presence is a gift, and we embrace you with open arms and warm aloha."
