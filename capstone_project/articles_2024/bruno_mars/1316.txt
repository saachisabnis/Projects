Never thought we'd see the day Rockford would get its own Hard Rock Casino, but here we are! On Thursday, August 29th, the doors will officially open, and it's safe to say this is going to be one unforgettable weekend.
The Hard Rock Casino has lined up some serious talent for the grand opening weekend; Akon, Brad Paisley, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, and Nielsen Trust—all performing over Labor Day weekend.  Are you ready?!

I've spent years traveling to Chicago and Milwaukee to see big-name artists perform.
After hearing Teddy Swims is performing on September 20th at the Hard Rock Live, I really can't wait to see what this new entertainment venue has in store for us.
This got me thinking—who else would we love to see take the main stage at Rockford's Hard Rock Live?
A ton of people suggested Matt Rife for a comedy show, too.
OOOHHHH! POST MALONE! If he came to Rockford... I'd go insane!  Benson Boone, too.  He's a rising artist this year I'd love to see live.  So many talented artists who would sell out in minutes, no doubt about that!
Can't wait to see all the major headliners at the Hard Rock over the next few years.  It'll bring a lot of tourism to Rockford and make a better name for ourselves!
