Can you guess which country artist is the shortest in the entire genre?
Some of country’s tallest singer-songwriters of all time include Alan Jackson, Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins and Lady A’s Charles Kelley. The tallest country star of all time is Ray Benson, who reaches 6’7’’, according to data gathered by largest.org. See the list of the tallest country artists of all time here. A report by TheShot, focused on movie and television coverage, recently examined the shortest musicians in country music and beyond. That report notes that “the average height for a woman in the US is about 5’4” tall, while the average height for a man is 5’9” tall.”
Artists who made the list include Cee Lo Green, Lil Wayne, Phil Collins, Bono, Bruno Mars, Billy Joel, Fergie, Britney Spears, Demi Lovato, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, Prince, Ariana Grande and many others. TheShot notes that although one beloved country star is shorter than average, she was once quoted saying, “I walk tall. I got a tall attitude.” See the list of some of the shortest artists in country music below, and see the full, genre-spanning list of the shortest musicians here.
