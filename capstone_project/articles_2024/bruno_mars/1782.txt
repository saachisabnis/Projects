Round three is here, and it’s looking like we are going to have some tough decisions while trying to figure out the best song that we love to dance to at weddings.
We’ve got some hard decisions to make in these quarterfinal matchups! It looks like we’re about to have the battle between Bruno Mars! Can you pick between “Marry You” and “Uptown Funk?” Both songs always get people on the dance floor, but it’s such a hard decision!
