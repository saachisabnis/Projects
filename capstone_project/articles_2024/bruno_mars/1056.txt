Cardi B just gave her kids, Kulture and Wave, the gift of another sibling. 
The rapper announced the arrival of her third child in an Instagram post shared on Sept. 12. 
"The prettiest lil thing 🌸🌸 9/7/24 💖💖💖," the mother of three captioned the post, which included photos of her and her baby, as well as with her two kids and estranged husband, Offset, at the hospital. 
Cardi B announced on Aug. 1 that she was expecting baby No. 3 on the heels of her divorce news.
“With every new ending comes a new beginning!” Cardi B wrote on Instagram, in part. “It’s so much easier taking life’s twists, turns and test laying down, but you, your brother and your sister have shown me why it’s worth it to push through!” 
In the photo, the pregnant rapper, 31, posed with one hand on her belly. 
Cardi B and Offset are also parents to daughter Kulture, 6, and son Wave, 3.
Offset is also a father to sons Jordan, 14, Kody, 9, and daughter Kalea, 9, from previous relationships.
In 2022, Cardi B, — born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar — opened up to Vogue Singapore about becoming a mom early in her music career.
“I didn’t have an album out when I found out I was pregnant,” she said. “Everybody was so nervous for my future, but I kept telling them, ‘It’s easy. Trust me, I’m going to have a nanny and she’s going to travel up and down with me. It’s not even going to be a hassle.”
Then Kulture was born in July 2018, and Cardi B suddenly saw things differently. 
“When the baby got here, I couldn’t even think about getting a nanny because I was afraid of anybody being around her besides my family,” Cardi B told Vogue Singapore. “I’ve never had a nanny for Kulture.”

On July 11, 2018, Cardi B announced the birth of her first child, Kulture Kiari Cephus. 
“My dude named the baby,” Cardi B revealed on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” ahead of Kulture's arrival. Kulture’s middle name comes from her father, Offset, who was born Kiari Kendrell Cephus.
That year, she pulled out of her upcoming tour with Bruno Mars to be at home with Kulture. 
“I thought that after giving birth to my daughter that 6 weeks would be enough time for me to recover mentally and physically. I also thought that I’d be able to bring her with me on tour but I think I underestimated this whole mommy thing,” she wrote on Instagram.  “Not only am I just not ready physically, I’m not ready to leave my baby behind.”
When Cardi B appeared on the 3rd hour of TODAY in 2021, she described Kulture as “having a very strong personality.”
“She wants what she want,” Cardi B said. “She knows she’s famous.”
While on TODAY, Cardi B also shared an invaluable piece of parenting wisdom.
“The biggest lesson I learned is don’t take advice from no other mothers, especially the ones on social media, the robot moms, the ones that tell you your kid’s supposed to be off Pampers at 1 years old and then on binkies on 1 years old,” Cardi B said. “Every kid is different, every kid develop different, and not everybody else’s child is like my child.”
There's no question that Kulture lives a life of luxury — she even owns an  hot pink Hermès Birkin bag! In 2020, Cardi B reflected on how different Kulture's ubringing is from her own. 
“She lives a different lifestyle than I lived. This girl gets in a pool every single day; I can’t swim because I barely went to the pool. ... I want her to know that just because you have money, that doesn’t mean you’re super-privileged," Cardi B explained while chatting with Billboard. "Even me with her dad, we have had really bad experiences with police, and we’re rich and famous. I want her to know that you’re not going to be an exception. I want her to have compassion. I don’t want her to ever have the mentality of, ‘This doesn’t apply to me.’”
In September 2021, Cardi B announced that she and Offset had welcomed a son together. Seven months later, Offset shared that they had named their second child Wave Set Cephus.
Later that year, Cardi B shared photos from an Essence magazine photo shoot of her entire family. The shoot included Kody, Jordan and Kalea, Offset’s children from previous relationships.
“Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen for me and our family,” she wrote in her Instagram post. “I love having a huge family with all of our kids and I’m grateful that we are making our blended family work.”
In 2023, Cardi B shared a clip of Wave after he spilled a snack all over the floor. When she tells him he needs to clean up his mess, he makes angry face. "Y'all mad at me," she wrote alongside laughing emojis. 
Cardi B confessed to Rolling Stone in 2024 that she was "afraid" to have a boy. But that feeling went away as soon as she laid eyes on Wave.
“It’s like it’s meant to be. The stars align. My kids are the best decisions I ever made," Cardi B said.
Cardi B and Offset's third child was born Sept. 7, 2024. 
The parents did not share their baby's name at the time of the newborn's arrival. 
Cardi B simply wrote, "The prettiest lil thing 🌸🌸 9/7/24 💖💖💖," on the announcement, implying it was a baby girl with the pink flower and heart emoji, and the pink blanket and beanie the baby wore in the photos.
