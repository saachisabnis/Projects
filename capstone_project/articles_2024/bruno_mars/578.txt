A video Miley Cyrus made in 2010 for the charitable organization To Write Love On Her Arms has gone viral because it shows Miley seemingly explaining to Joaquin Phoenix who Lady Gaga is. In the clip, Miley asks Phoenix if he knows who Lady Gaga is. Though he tries to bluff, he finally admits that he’s not familiar with her music. While it’s likely the exchange is scripted, the video has resurfaced now because Phoenix and Lady Gaga are co-starring in Joker: Folie à Deux. The user who posted the clip wrote, “14 years ago, Miley Cyrus educated Joaquin Phoenix on Lady Gaga and now we have the Joker 2. Thank You Miley.”
