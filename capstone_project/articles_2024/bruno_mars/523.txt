The 68th season of the International Music Camp begins on Sunday, June 16. This season IMC is welcoming over 1,300 students from 13 different countries, more than 23 American states, and five Canadian provinces, with additional students registering daily. 
The first session is for students in grades 5-8 and offers programs in middle school art, band and choir. On Saturday, June 22, the Middle School Art program, directed by AJ Gorthy of Minot, will have an exhibition from 12:30-3 p.m. in the Masonic Auditorium.  The two Middle School Bands and the Middle School Choir perform at 1:30 pm in the Masonic Auditorium. The art exhibition and concerts are free and open to the public. 
The Session One Festival of the Arts performance on Friday, June 15, will feature THOSE GUYS. Made up of performers who represent a cross-section of the Winnipeg music and theater community, THOSE GUYS have built a reputation for dynamic, feel-good performances. Their repertoire, which ranges from Billy Joel to Bruno Mars, features complex, often original, musical arrangements performed without a single instrument. 
All events at the International Music Camp are subject to the International Peace Garden gate fee of either $10 per person per day or $50 for a family annual season pass. Passports are not required to get in and out of the International Peace Garden, but are the recommended form of identification.  If you do not already have a passport, you will need a birth certificate for everyone in the vehicle and photo ID if  16 or older to return to your country of origin upon leaving IMC and the Peace Garden.
