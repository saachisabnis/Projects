Turns out, actor Tom Holland searches his girlfriend's name online almost as much as we do.
While appearing on the latest episode of Samah Dada‚Äôs On The Menu podcast, the actor admitted that the last person he "googled" was "actually Zendaya."
"The last thing I googled was actually Zendaya,‚Äù Holland said at the time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on [social media], and I delete it when I‚Äôm not using it. So, sometimes, like, it's more of a bit of an anxiety thing, but I'll check to see if everything's good and to make sure we're all cool."
The Spider-Man star went on to explain that from time-to-time he'll "give her a little Google and look [through] the news."
"And I'm like, 'She's good,'" he added.
While the idea of a Hollywood A-lister googling his own romantic partner might be surprising, what's not is the fact that Holland is wildly protective of his Euphoria star girlfriend. Just recently, the actor went viral after he protected Zendaya from a swarm of paparazzi.

After he was briefly separated from his girlfriend‚Äîwho kindly stopped to sign some autographs‚ÄîHolland returned to Zendaya and attempted to hold her hand and guide her through the growing crowd. When photographers refused to move, Holland told them to "give us a little space" and politely moved them out of the way so the couple could continue walking into the restaurant.
A clip of the interaction quickly went viral on social media, sparking a slew of comments praising Holland for how he handled the clearly overwhelming situation.
"Not only were they crowding her but they were trying to push him away. his reaction is valid," one fan wrote via TikTok.
"TOM HOLLAND THE MAN THAT YOU ARE üßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" another wrote.
"He‚Äôs doing a better security job than actual security," another commented.

In a 2023 interview with Elle, Zendaya opened up about life under the spotlight and what her and her boyfriend's fame means for their relationship.
‚ÄúParts of my life, I accept, are going to be public. I can‚Äôt not be a person and live my life and love the person I love," she told the publication at the time.
"But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It‚Äôs about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can‚Äôt hide," she continued. "That‚Äôs not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now.‚Äù
