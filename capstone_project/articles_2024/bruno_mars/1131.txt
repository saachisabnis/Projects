ARTS: DE DONDE? With it being an election year, the U.S. southern border is under high scrutiny. Migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Venezuela and other Central and South American countries come to the United States in search of a better life, and they’re often met with xenophobia. Mary Gallagher’s 1991 play De Donde? explores the experience of these migrants. Director Ana Gudiño tells the Weekly that the play is personal to her, and sparks a conversation about empathy. “These stories matter to me because, as an immigrant, they reflect on the experiences I grew up with,” Gudiño says. “While there’s considerable discussion about immigration and border reform, the conditions and treatment in detention centers often receive less attention. I hope the play fosters greater empathy for the individuals in these stories, who share the same goals and dreams as everyone else.” Thru 8/25, Thursdays-Sundays, times vary, $30, Majestic Repertory Theatre, tickettailor.com. –Shannon Miller

MUSIC: DEZZY HOLLOW In the world of hip-hop, listeners can often pinpoint which coast an artist hails from based on flow and samples. West Coast rap, with its innovative spirit, often intertwines with the sounds of funk—so much so that the subgenre g-funk pays homage to ‘70s sounds that influenced the legendary years of ‘90s rap. Dezzy Hollow, an up-and-comer from Oceanside, California, embraces this legacy on his latest album, Caught In The Funk. The 14-track project showcases Hollow’s ability to expand his range while staying true to the sound that raised him. His track “Slippin’” samples the Midnight Star’s “No Parking (On the Dance Floor),” and while familiar in sound, Hollow’s contemporary and laidback flow gives it new life—a testament to his mastery of old-school influences, making him one of the hottest new voices in the genre. 8 p.m., $35, Backstage Bar & Billiards, dice.fm. –Gabriela Rodriguez

ARTS: COMPANY Stephen Sondheim’s critically acclaimed musical comedy gets a refreshing revival in this retelling of Company, which follows Bobbie, a woman whose single status becomes the topic of the town among her coupled friends. In this production, Tony Award-winning director Marianne Elliott gender-swaps the original male character to create an ever greater sense of societal pressure, because God forbid a woman over 30 isn’t married and loving it! In today’s culture of dating apps, hard-launching lovers on Instagram and navigating divorce one messy Facebook post at a time, Company feels more relatable than ever. Whether you’re single, looking or happily taken, this one will surely strike a chord. Thru 8/25, times vary, $35-$155, Reynolds Hall, thesmithcenter.com. –Amber Sampson

The “Save the Roach” started as a joke but became a meaningful metaphor for preserving the artist’s passion for hip-hop.
It’s not just about putting Leia in the metal bikini and calling it a day—the good-natured campiness of “Star Wars” is fully awakened.
