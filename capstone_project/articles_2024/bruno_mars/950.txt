Sharon Quilter talked about Black History being everyone’s history. Black History Month was originally established to honour the contributions of all African and Caribbean communities to the UK over the generations. Now it recognises and celebrates the rich history, achievements and contributions of Black people from all backgrounds. It also serves to inspire and empower future generations. It provides an opportunity to reset the negative narrative about Black people and a platform to write a more positive history, to re-shape the landscape. Sharon mentioned individuals who are today making significant contributions in the UK. Sir William Wooley – Lord Woolley of Woodford. Amongst his contributions are being Principal of Homerton College, Cambridge since October 2021, a first for an Oxbridge college. Dame Maggie Aderin -Pocock OBE, a space scientist and Presenter of The Sky at Night on BBC TV. Bishop Wilfred Wood, consecrated the first Black Bishop in the Church of England as Bishop of Croydon in 1985. Lillian Bader, one of the first Black women to join the RAF, joining the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force in 1941. She found herself, “the only coloured person in this sea of white faces”. By the end of 1941 she was a Leading Aircraftwoman at RAF Shawbury, soon gaining the rank of Acting Corporal. By the end of the 20th century, three generations of her family served in the British Armed Forces.
Sharon suggested reading books by authors Zadie Smith, Mo Gillingham and Malorie Blackman. She suggested watching TV series by David Olusoga and the Dimbleby Lecture by David Harewood.  Among films she highlighted were – To Sir with love – and – Murder is easy – an adaptation of an Agatha Christie book with David Jonsson as the detective.
Of course there is music to explore by numerous black artists. She also suggested a visit to the Black Cultural Archives, 1 Windrush Square, London SW2 1EF
