	In each of the past eight weeks, Sabrina Carpenter has placed three songs in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. On the latest (Oct. 26-dated) chart, “Espresso,” her first top 10, rebounds 4-3 to its peak; “Taste” slips 7-8, after it debuted at its No. 2 best; and “Please Please Please” falls 9-10, after it became her first No. 1 in June.

	Thanks to her trio of buzzy hits — all from Short n’ Sweet, her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 — Carpenter is the first artist to notch a run of as many as eight weeks with at least three simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s this decade.

	Drake last scored such a hat trick, posting nine consecutive weeks with three Hot 100 top 10s in April-June 2018, all from his Billboard 200 No. 1 Scorpion.

	Notably, Carpenter surpassed Cardi B for the longest such streak among women; the latter claimed three concurrent Hot 100 top 10s for four weeks in January 2018.

	Overall, 50 Cent has linked the longest run of three or more Hot 100 top 10s, having tripled (or quadrupled) up for 11 straight weeks in February-April 2005.

	As with many Hot 100 achievements, The Beatles did it first. For 10 weeks in a row, on the charts dated Feb. 29 through May 2, 1964, the group tallied five weeks with three top 10s; three weeks with a fab four top 10s; and two frames with five top 10s.

	Meanwhile, Carpenter, Justin Bieber (10 weeks, 2015-16) and The Beatles are the only artists to earn a triumphant trifecta in the Hot 100’s top 10 for eight or more weeks consecutively with no other billed acts on their songs.

	Below, browse through a rundown of every act, spanning from early Beatlemania to Carpenter’s now lengthy (n’ sweet) success, that has earned three or more simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s for four or more consecutive weeks.
