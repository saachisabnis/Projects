“Doja Cat, for sure, is my next goal”
BLACKPINK rapper and soloist Lisa has shared that she wants to collaborate with Doja Cat.
In a recent interview with Audacy, the Thai singer-rapper opened up about her recent singles and the artists she has worked with so far. Lisa shared that there were “a lot” of artists she hoped to work with on her solo projects.
“But for now that I can think of, Doja Cat. I love her,” Lisa said, though she added that she worked with many of her dream collaborators across her latest releases. “Doja Cat, for sure, is my next goal.”
On the topic of collaborations, she also spoke about working with Spanish singer-songwriter Rosalía on their August single ‘New Woman’. Lisa voiced her admiration for her confidence on the set of their music video: “She’s amazing, she’s a professional, like every single take, that like action, she’s just doing her thing”
“she just maintains her identity with her music, with her art and everything. So, yeah, I wanted to be someone like her that can maintain my identity,” she added.
Elsewhere, Lisa discussed sampling Sixpence None the Richer’s ‘Kiss Me’ in her latest single ‘Moonlit Floor’. “When I was young, I don’t know, five or six, my dad always played that in a car,” she recalled. “So I [was] kind of familiar with that song.”
In other BLACKPINK news, vocalist Rosé returned last week with her new single ‘APT.’ featuring Bruno Mars. In a five-star review of the track, NME’s Rhian Daly called it “addictive, flirty and a whole lot of fun”, noting that the “power and confidence in her voice far surpasses her past performances”.
