	Lady Gaga is promoting her song with the help of her adorable new puppy .

	The superstar took to TikTok to share a video in which she’s seen singing along to her freshly released Bruno Mars collab, “Die With a Smile.” In the clip, Gaga has a bright blue eye makeup look as she sweetly cradles a tiny French Bulldog.

	Shortly after the project dropped last week, the Joker star and “Uptown Funk!” hitmaker gave “Die With a Smile” its live debut at Mars’ Thursday night (Aug. 15) concert at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. For the show, he wore a cowboy hat, while Gaga again sported bee-hive hair akin to her look in the music video, maintaining the song’s retro feel.

	The pair barely gave fans a heads up before announcing that their new song was on the way, simply posting the cover art and confirming its release date on Instagram less than 12 hours ahead of time. “WHILE YOU WAIT TILL LG7… ‘DIE WITH A SMILE’ a duet with @brunomars ❤️‍🔥” Gaga wrote at the time, teasing her upcoming seventh album.
