I saw a good handful of great concerts at The Palace: Paul McCartney, The Who, Michael Jackson, etc.....and now it's gone. Has been since 2020.
The Palace of Auburn Hills housed the games of the Pistons, Vipers and Detroit Shock and hosted more great rock shows, including: AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Bruno Mars, Cheap Trick, Cher, Eric Clapton, Andrew Dice Clay, Joe Cocker, Phil Collins, Bill Cosby, Crosby Stills & Nash, The Cure, Def Leppard, Neil Diamond, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Peter Frampton, Grand Funk, Grateful Dead, Janet Jackson, Jethro Tull, Joan Jett, Billy Joel, Kiss, Madonna, Tim McGraw & Faith Hill, Motley Crue, Page & Plant, Tom Petty, Phish, Pink Floyd, Poison, Rush, Rod Stewart, Roger Waters, Sting, U2, and Van Halen.....and that's just a few.
The Palace closed in 2017, with Bob Seger being its final rock show.
FAST FACTS:1986: Broke ground 1986: Cost for construction, $90 million (approximately $232 million in 2024 dollars) 1988: Opened 2005: Renovated 2017: Closed 2020: Demolished
The Palace was built in order to bring better viewing of sports events, to replace the games at the Pontiac Silverdome, where the viewing was considered 'substandard'.
Many good memories for many of us who attended the Palace, so the following photos may bring a frown to some. Take a look inside the Palace in 2020, not long before the place was torn down...
