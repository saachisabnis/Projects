I feel like sabrina will be stronger than chappell 
She needs to have surefire and different sounding hit to Espresso and Please Please Please so that people can feel three different vibes leading into the voting period.
It would be nice if dance Pop kept being won by those who in recent history have been unheralded in the Pop field, like Kylie or probable runner-up Troye. 
don’t worry, the next dance pop winner has arrived and thy name is Charli xcx.
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
weeks in the US spotify top 10; compares favorably to last few Pop solo/roty winners:
espresso 16
flowers 14
drivers license 14
easy on me 10
watermelon sugar 9
about Damn Time 8
leave the door open 8
everything I wanted 6
if we’re going by “impact on Pop music in the 2010s,” then the queen would be Lana del Rey. 
Lol let’s not be so pretentious Jesus…
2024：Anora, The Substance, Dune 2, Flow, The Girl With The Needle
saying lana del Rey had a lot of impact is “pretentious”? ok then.
VAMPIRE WEEKEND DOING CAMPAIGNE OMG 
It's me... Hi
I will always wonder what it is about H.E.R. that is so important to the American music industry. 
It's me... Hi
Billie performed Birds Of A Feather at the Olympics but the performance was… something. I’m not sure it was good campaigning xddd
Chappell is looking to have seven songs actively charting, GLB is reaching a new peak at around #6, and the first song off of Midwest Princess has entered the top 20. I could see her album peaking in the top 2 this week since it’s already at #3, before Post Malone’s and Sabrina’s new albums

The song is already rising on iTunes after the performance. We may get a new peak in streams in these next few days. If she releases a MV, the song might just rise to #1 on the Hot 100. Not that it matters much, since it’s Billie… but it’s another milestone.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall

I’m begging Billie to submit Birds of a Feather for the 67th Grammys.

Wonder if it could hit #1 in September, she has a bunch of variants dropping for the anniversary
“BIRDS OF A FEATHER” is currently #1 on US iTunes following Billie’s performance at the closing ceremony of the 2024 Summer #Olympics! 🪶💙 pic.twitter.com/wwGcDY5vOz

Yeah. Came on here to see the discourse around Billie. Birds of a Feather is going to be a career defining song for her. I expect ROTY and SOTY at this point.
