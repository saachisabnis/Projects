Having been forced out of this week's Strictly Come Dancing live show, after suffering a 'medical emergency' backstage last week, Amy Dowden was left in tears on Saturday night, as JB Gill got his highest score yet for his performance with her co-star Lauren Oakley.
It was revealed last Sunday, just hours before the Halloween Week results show, that popular pro Amy had collapsed backstage shortly after she and JB performed their Foxtrot in the BBC ballroom. After an urgent 999 call was made, an ambulance raced to the Strictly studio, with Amy checked over and then taken to Barnet Hospital, leaving JB to film the results on his own.
Having made it through to Icons Week, JB was partnered with stand-in Lauren, with Amy ruled out of rehearsals and the live show and the pairing worked wonders in front of millions of viewers at home; as they danced a Couples Choice to a Bruno Mars medley. The judges went wild for the number, with Shirley Ballas declaring there 'wasn't a score high enough' to give, as the routine was so, so good.
And the glowing feedback from Shirley and her Strictly colleagues was reflected in the scores they gave, with Craig the only judge not to give a 10, as he gave a 9 and Shirley, Motsi and Anton each held up their 10 paddle.
JB and Lauren looked overjoyed with the marks, which Strictly host Claudia Winkleman insisted was 'for all three of them,' as the camera then cut to a visibly moved Amy who was crying. As well as being JB's best score so far, the 39/40 sent him straight to the leaderboard, to eclipse Sarah Hadland, who had been there minutes earlier after getting 37 for her cha cha to Madonna's Like A Prayer.
