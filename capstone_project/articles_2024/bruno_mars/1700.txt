Why Lawd? is the much anticipated follow-up to 2016's Yes Lawd from superduo NxWorries! With a successful solo career, a hit album with Bruno Mars, Super Bowl half-time shows and Grammy nominations, it isn't surprising that it's taken an artist as prolific as Anderson .Paak some time to circle back around to this particular project, and it also comes as no surprise that him and producer Knxwledge have created another record of genuine quality filled with soulful gems. The blueprint of the record will be instantly recognisable to fans, with the trademark mixture of soul and R'n'B, but with some twists on the old formula.
Daydreaming is one of the album's standout tracks, a nostalgia-soaked lovesong dripping in an 80s vibe, synths and an absolutely killer guitar tone. Other highlights include WalkOnBy (featuring Earl Sweatshirt and Rae Khalil), and FromHere (featuring Snoop Dogg and October London), a lowkey slowjam made for those late summer evenings just over the horizon. While there are some tracks that feel distinctly like filler, there's more than enough substance on Why Lawd? to justify the price of admission. Let's hope we don't have to wait another eight years for this duo to get together again.
