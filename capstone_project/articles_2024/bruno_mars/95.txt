media release: Marquette Waterfront Festival is the official curtain-raiser to the eastside’s glorious season of summer music festivals. The festival celebrates its 36th year on June 14-15, mixing hot local talent with national touring acts on two stages. (Lineup announcement coming soon!)
As always, Waterfront will feature a terrific array of vendors from local businesses, artists and restaurants, as well as craft beer and wine tents. Kids games from Madison Scouts of Troop 29, and the Dandelion Dash (Saturday, 11:30 a.m.) will return as well. On Sunday morning, join or watch the River Alliance’s Fools’ Flotilla! The zany boat parade takes off from the Tenney Park locks at 10:30 a.m. down the Yahara River toward the park. Flotilla registration information will be shared here closer to the event.
