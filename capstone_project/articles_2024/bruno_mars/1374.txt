Singaporeans who were dining at Lau Pa Sat recently may have spotted some really famous seat neighbours: Hong Kong stars Joey Yung, Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi.
The tight-knit trio thrilled fans here when they were in town on Monday (Mar 17), apparently to film an episode of their Douyin travelogue Girls’ Spectacular Journey. The series centres on the BFFs as they explore cities and try local food.
And speaking of local food, nothing is more Singaporean than eating durians, which Yung, 43, Chung, 43, and Choi, 41, also sampled at durian specialty cafe 99 Old Trees.
So who actually likes durians among them? The cafe’s owner Kelvin Tan revealed: “Joey Yung is a durian lover. Gillian and Charlene, not so much.”
According to his staff Spencer, who served the three stars during their visit, they arrived with a “big entourage” and ate a platter with six durian cultivars. “They liked Mao Shan Wang the most,” said Spencer.
The trio sat at a table outdoors in the sweltering heat for filming, though Spencer shared that “they had bubbly personalities and lots of energy”.
It appears that the hot weather didn’t affect their make-up or restore their hair to ‘factory settings’ (like what happened to Taylor Swift during her recent concert here). As 99 Old Trees’ founder Kelvin, who is 40, put it: “I look like their father when I stand next to them, but they are actually all older than me.”
Incidentally, the cafe also has a durian hackin’ staff member who looks a lot like Bruno Mars (the singer will be in town next month to perform at the National Stadium), and celebs like Stefanie Sun, Kit Chan, Nathan Hartono, Pierre Png, Chen Liping and Yahui have also gotten their pongy fruit fix there.
99 Old Trees is at 1 Teo Hong Rd, S088321. Tel: 9822-2495. Open daily 12pm-10pm. www.99oldtrees.com
