Choose one of these romantic, unplugged hits for your walk down the aisle or reception slow dance.

 When you think of a traditional wedding reception, you probably picture a sea of guests on their feet—and can practically hear the upbeat music ("Shout," anyone?). While fast-paced songs and dances certainly are major elements of a big-day party, every celebration needs a few quiet moments to reinforce what everyone is really gathered for, which is romance. Adding a few acoustic love songs into the mix is a great way to do just that. There's something magical that happens when live musicians unplug and rely on just their voices and stripped-down instruments to carry a song. The resulting performance is intimate and vibe-y in the best possible way. You don't even need a wedding band to pull this off: Asking your DJ to play acoustic renditions of your favorite songs has the same impact and offers tired, sweaty guests a much-needed change of pace after a round of bops.

 Acoustic love songs work just as well during the ceremony, when softer, more romantic vocals and instrumentals are needed to set the tone for a couple's vow exchange. In this case, think of an acoustic song as a step above an instrumental option or string quartet; it's a great compromise for duos who want to actually hear lyrics that resonate with their love stories, but don't want a full-throttle musical component to overpower the moment.

 Regardless of where or when you decide to use these tunes, you're probably looking for a comprehensive set list so you can choose the best acoustic love song for your celebration. You're in luck: We put together some our favorites from artists like Leon Bridges, John Mayer, Jack Johnson, and Alicia Keys. Regardless of your taste, there's a little something for everyone. Ahead, discover some of the best acoustic love songs to play at your wedding.
