Beyoncé is spreading holiday cheer in true Queen Bey fashion, getting fans hyped for her upcoming Christmas Day halftime performance. The Grammy-winning icon shared a teaser on Instagram on Wednesday, offering a sneak peek at her much-anticipated show during the NFL game between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans at NRG Stadium in her hometown of Houston.
In the short but captivating clip, Beyoncé struts confidently through a snowy backdrop, placing a football-shaped ornament on a glowing, decorated cactus. Clad in an all-white ensemble complete with blonde braids and a fluffy cowboy hat, she poses as the cactus lights up. The caption read, "A Cowboy Carter Christmas. Houston, Texas 12.25," igniting excitement among her Beyhive fans.
The halftime show, set to air live on Netflix, marks a monumental moment as Beyoncé will perform songs from her latest album, "Cowboy Carter," for the first time. Fans have been talking about the album's announcement in a surprise Super Bowl commercial earlier this year. The debut singles, "16 Carriages" and "Texas Hold' Em," became instant hits, dominating streaming platforms and fueling anticipation for a live performance.
This Christmas Day gig isn't just any performance—it's a homecoming celebration for Beyoncé, who continues to spotlight her Texas roots. Her blend of cowboy-inspired aesthetics and powerhouse vocals promises a memorable experience for both football fans and music lovers. With the show's buzz surrounding it, game day ticket sales have soared, making the Baltimore-Houston matchup one of the season's most anticipated events. 
On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé delivered an electrifying performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, a moment that not only cemented her status as a global superstar but also thrilled fans with an epic Destiny's Child reunion. Taking over the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Queen Bey lit up the stage with a show still regarded as one of the best halftime performances.
Dressed in a sleek black leather bodysuit, Beyoncé brought the stadium down with her signature powerhouse vocals, precise choreography, and commanding stage presence. Midway through the performance, Beyoncé surprised fans with a surprise they'll never forget—Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams were suddenly elevated onto the stage to join her. 
The trio performed a medley of Destiny's Child hits, including "Bootylicious" and "Independent Women Part I," before seamlessly joining Beyoncé for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." The reunion was brief but impactful, showcasing the unbreakable bond between the group members and their enduring influence in pop music.  
On February 7, 2016, she returned to the Super Bowl stage alongside Chris Martin of Coldplay and Bruno Mars.
