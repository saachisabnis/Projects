Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars have teamed up for an unexpected new single titled “Die With a Smile.” The multi-Grammy winners have delivered their first collaboration as a duo, shocking fans with their epic love ballad duet. 
In a statement, Lady Gaga shares how the project came together noting, “Bruno and I have a lot of mutual respect for each other and were talking about collaborating. I was finishing up my own album in Malibu and one night after a long day he asked me to come to his studio to hear something he was working on. It was around midnight when I got there and I was blown away when I heard what he had started making. We stayed up all night and finished writing and recording the song. Bruno’s talent is beyond explanation. His musicianship and vision is next level. There’s no one like him.” Bruno also gave his own statement on what it was like working with her, “Getting to work with Gaga has been an honor. She’s an icon and she makes this song magical. I’m so excited for everyone to hear it.”
Combining the powerful songwriting of both dynamic artists and their captivating vocals and artistry, the song release was accompanied by a music video as well. While Lady Gaga appears to channel her inner Dolly Parton and Bruno Mars as Porter Wagoner, the visuals see the pair wear matching red-and-blue outfits that could have been easily found on the Grand Ole Opry stage in the ’60s. Mars is on guitar while Gaga is on the piano with a cigarette hanging from her lips as they sing, ““If the world was ending, I’d wanna be next to you/ If the party was over, and our time on Earth was through/I’d wanna hold you just for a while/ And die with a smile.”
