Beyoncé has plenty of adoring fans, but Dave Portnoy is definitely not one of them.
The singer performed several of her songs from her Cowboy Carter album at NRG Stadium in Houston during the halftime show of the Texans-Ravens game on Christmas Day. After Beyoncé's performance, Portnoy took to his X account to share his thoughts on the situation.
"Beyoncé has been LOST since Destinys Child," he said, quote tweeting an old tweet from him from 2023 that shared how he thought Rihanna was far superior to Beyoncé.
