that Eminem song better come and go

Best song of the album and one of the best of the year

Lunch might be catchier, but BOAF is super radiofriendly and easy for any audience to digest, which is why it’s doing so well. I really hope she pushes it as a single. On Apple Music, it’s in the top 10 while Lunch is out. Lunch isn’t making waves on the radio, and given the song’s lyrics, it makes sense. With the right push, BOAF could be a huge hit. If it becomes a big hit, only someone like Bruno Mars could take the Grammys away from Billie.
If Birds Of A Feather becomes a big hit and it’s submitted in the General Field then Billie is sweeping like in 2020.

sadly this time she makes art

I wouldn’t worry too much about Eminem. He was one of the first artists to call the Grammys out on their behavior & how they award people. He’s also said he wants nothing to do with them, either.

Well I have bought one copy to date
Just like most ppl
It could’ve go to Boygenius and SZA though, especially both these songs were better than Flowers.
I would’ve been fine with one of those two winning. Same with Victoria & Jon.

They were about to shove Lunch down the public’s throat but we said NO. Lunch’s weakening streams is probably the label reducing its promo, hopefully to reinforce BOAF. 
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
 Gaga has literally been releasing grammy winning album after grammy winning album since 2014, her last album to miss a grammy win was ARTPOP ten years ago, since then it’s been 5 albums in a row winning 
Gaga will be pure filler especially in The GF. It’s 2024 so please stop with this Gaga nonsense. she’s just not a relevant artist anymore and the quality of her music has significantly declined in the last few years. She will get her usual Pop nominations but im not sure she’s getting nominated in The GF. I hope she’s not because she is one of the most over-rewarded artist in Grammy history. There is no way she’s deserving of 13 Grammy wins, even tho they are all in the “below-the-line” genre categories. She just doesn’t have the discography and career to justify that many of wins. She should have like 7-8 wins max if we are being honest. Well at least she’s never won in the GF so it could be worse.
So yeah, Gaga is more relevant and impressive as an actress and will be more competitive at The Oscars. The only category she has a chance to win is Pop Dance Recording.

Why are there so many Gaga hopedictions? I definetly agree with Gucci. Her album won’t make any noise and will be DOA. It’s foolish to believe otherwise and to predict her as a serious contender. She’s not getting a “Star is Born” moment with Joker 2. I seriously doubt that movie will impact her Grammy momentum.
“Not Like Us” is a certified smash and a strong frontrunner for Rap Performance (and Rap Song). Kendrick got a huge discography boost and will have massive momentum going into this year’s Grammys. “Not Like Us” is a huge smash with the Anti-Drake narrative and huge cultural impact.

sure Jan. Billie released twice as much variants and still couldn’t reach the top. 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
