Lady Gaga fused country fashion and classic glamour in the music video for “Die With a Smile,” her new duet with Bruno Mars, modeling red Roger Vivier pumps as she sang alongside her fellow pop star.
The duo of powerhouse vocalists released the ballad as a single on Aug. 16, revealing a retro-inspired music video alongside it.
On stage, both Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga were dressed in red and blue southern-inspired ensembles. While Mars wore a blue suit and a red shirt with a 70s-style collar, Lady Gaga matched him in a long sleeve blue dress and red tights. Her outfit was also accented with a red scarf and loose red sleeves which created a layered look underneath her dress. Both singers’ outfits featured embroidery resembling stalks of wheat. Additional country details included Bruno Mars’ cowboy hat and Lady Gaga’s beehive hairstyle reminiscent of Dolly Parton.

With a shiny finish, they appeared to be made of satin and offered a sleek shine to her well-coordinated ensemble.
