Amanda Waller's bid for control and ultimate power has failed, and though
Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the rest of the DC Universe's
heroes stand triumphant, they have learned a valuable lesson: they are
better together than apart.
Forming a new Justice League Unlimited, the heroes usher in a new era of
unity just in time to face a returned, very different Darkseid. As the first
blows land against the Lord of Apokolips, shock waves ripple across the DC
Universe and shake the very nature of its reality to the core. As the dust
settles from this titanic battle, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and
the League itself find themselves at new beginnings…
Collects Absolute Power #4, DC ALL IN Special #1, Justice League Unlimited #1,
Batman #153, Wonder Woman #14, and Superman #19.

before! This fine publication is a celebration of all things passed, pre-scent,
and toot-ure. Sequential art's place in the annals of history is about to
change with the release of the Harley Quinn Fartacular: Silent Butt Deadly, a
comic that promises to have the highest concentration of gas per page (GPP)
ever committed to print. Emphasis on committed, because everyone who
worked on this comic is getting thrown into Dr. Fartley's Home for No-Good
Gassy Gals 'n' Guys. Read the comic that Abraham Lincoln called "a joy from
fart to finish" moments before he died!
WARNING: We aren't kidding. If you are grossed out by farts, then this comic
isn't for you (and that's perfectly okay!…though I am judging you!). Unless
you want to put your feelings to the test…in which case this comic is for you.

Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira holds many surprises…the
most adorable having floppy ears and long tails! Kangas are companions and
partners of the Amazons, beloved steeds and protectors of their bonded
warriors. And on the island, a school exists to train the next generation of
kangas for the many battles and challenges of the future.
And it's finally here—Bonding Day, the long-awaited time when Amazons
are matched up with newly trained kangas to make the perfect pairs. This
special event only happens once every 20 years, but this Bonding Day is
unlike any other because this is the year when Princess Diana—the only
teenager on Themyscira—will choose a kanga for the first time.
Jumpa has been training hard to compete in the Tournament of Kangas,
where all the kangas get to show off what they can do. She knows she has
what it takes to match with the princess. The only catch is her friends
Skippa, Rooth, Goldie, and Big Red are all determined to do the same—and
the competition is fierce.
When Ares arrives on the island with a threat that forces the festivities to
be canceled, Jumpa must convince her friends to work together for the good
of Themyscira and to protect the princess they admire.
