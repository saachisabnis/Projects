Many celebrity icons, including Michael Keaton and Gigi Hadid, have ditched their real names for stage names. Keep reading to find out which of your favorite celebs are using an alias. 
Do you actually know the name of your favorite celeb?
Though it may not always be obvious, some of the biggest celebs are going by a name other than their own. From Michael Keaton to Gigi Hadid, a surprising number of artists adopt stage names—and it’s not just because they want to channel Hannah Montana and have the best of both worlds.
In the case of Michael Keaton—whose real name is Michael Douglas—the Beetlejuice star ditched his original moniker to comply with the Screen Actor’s Guild’s rule that no two members can have the same name. And because the Wall Street actor Michael Douglas and talk show host Mike Douglas had those bases covered, he opted for a different moniker.
As it turns out, Emma Stone—known by friends and family as Emily Stone—had a similar experience. But both actors have revealed that after many years of building a brand with their stage names, they’re ditching them for the real deal. And while this may take some getting used to, these talented actors are bringing a new level of authenticity to their work.
But stage names aren’t always something that are adopted out of necessity. Stars like Gigi Hadid—Jelena Noura Hadid—and Tina Fey—Elizabeth Stamatina Fey—simply chose their childhood nicknames. Other artists including Chappell Roan—Kayleigh Rose Amstutz—and Lana Del Rey—Elizabeth Woolridge Grant—can lean into different personas when they take to the stage.
In fact, when asked about the origins of her stage name, Chappell Roan revealed that her onstage alter ego started as a “drag project” that helped her set boundaries with fans and separate herself from the industry.
“It’s easier to separate the two because I’m already so involved in my project, in my work,” the “Casual” singer explained to AP News in October 2023, “and I feel like the drag of it all kind of lets you have a break when I take my makeup off, when I am off the stage.”
And these are only a few of the stars that have taken on different personas in Hollywood. Keep reading to find out how you should call these stars by their name.
Sterling Kelby Brown
The This Is Us alum explained why he went by his middle name Kelby until he was a teenager.
"My dad's name is Sterling Brown Jr., my grandfather is Sterling Brown Sr.,” he said during an April 2025 appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show. "I wanted my own name and it felt like Sterling was an old man's name."
But years after his dad died from a heart attack, Sterling decided to revert back to his first name as a way to honor his father.
"Because he passed away when I was 10, by the time I turned 16 and I hadn't heard his name for five, five-and-a-half years,” he continued. “I was like, ‘I kinda just want to hear that name again.’ So I asked people to call me Sterling."

For more than three decades, Cher was made to believe that her legal first name was Cherilyn. It wasn't until the late '70s, when she obtained her birth certificate in order to change her full name to just Cher, that she discovered that she had been registered as "Cheryl."

Then I became a professional singer and I needed a stage name that sounded a little less like my grandmother's name, because I'm named after my grandmother, both my grandmothers, Eilleen and Regina. I think, in my mind, I was just not really wanting to be called my grandmother's name onstage, so I decided to change it to Shania Twain. I met somebody with the name Shania, thought it was beautiful, and Shania Twain was born."
