NxWorries, the duo of Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge, officially announced their second album, Why Lawd?, due out on June 7 via Stones Throw Records. The long-awaited LP is previewed with “86Sentra,” which arrived with an accompanying video.
NxWorries released their debut album, Yes Lawd!, in 2016 to critical acclaim. The collab between drummer/MC Anderson .Paak and producer Knxwledge boasted standout tracks “Suede,” “Link Up” and “Lyk Dis.”
A new album from NXWorries has been on the horizon since the duo released a pair of singles, “Daydreaming” and “Where I Go,” the latter featuring H.E.R., in 2023 and 2022 respectively. Both tracks are set to land on Why Lawd? The duo also toured across the globe last year.
Anderson .Paak detailed his numerous projects including NxWorries and Silk Sonic in an interview with The Root in 2023.
Both artists took to social media to announce Why Lawd? As well as to share another preview, “86Sentra.” The track arrived with a visual created by Rhymezlikedimez. Watch below:
