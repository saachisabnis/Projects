Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez were planning on having a superstar singer at their now-cancelled wedding, and one artist who they were looking into was Bruno Mars — however, Bruno's hefty price tag left them with some sticker shock.
J.Lo and A-Rod's wedding planner, Marcy Blum, recently appeared on "The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast," and opened up about planning the wedding and trying to get an A-List performer for their big day. Blum recalled, "We were working with J.Lo and A-Rod before they broke up, and they were going through a list of musicians, and she goes, 'What about Bruno Mars?'" 
Marcy added that she had "just worked with" another couple on their wedding, during which Mars sang for "45 minutes to an hour" and received a whopping $5 million to do so. J.Lo's reaction? "Don’t be ridiculous!"
Listen to Marcy talk more about planning J.Lo and A-Rod's wedding and more wedding planning fun on "The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast" on iHeartRadio.
Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez were set to tie the knot in 2020 after getting engaged after two years of dating, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the couple to postpone the nuptials, which ultimately were cancelled when the pair broke up and ended their engagement in 2021. Not long after, Lopez rekindled her romance with her former flame, Ben Affleck.
