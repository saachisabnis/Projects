ROSÉ and Bruno Mars’ “APT.” rents a second week at No. 1 on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. A week earlier, the song debuted as each artist’s second leader on each chart.

	Notably, the collaboration by BLACKPINK member ROSÉ and Mars becomes the first song since the worldwide surveys began in September 2020 to have tallied at least 200 million streams globally in multiple weeks.

	Elsewhere, aespa’s “Whiplash” bounds to the top 10 of both the Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S.; Tyler, the Creator’s “St. Chroma,” featuring Daniel Caesar, debuts in the Global 200’s top 10; and JIN’s “I’ll Be There” arrives in the top tier on Global Excl. U.S.

	










	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

	“APT.,” released Oct. 18, tops the Global 200 for a second week with 207.5 million streams (down 8% week-over-week), as well as 17,000 sold (down 40%), worldwide Oct. 25-31. The song claims the sixth-biggest streaming week since the Global 200 began – and becomes the first title since the chart began to have logged at least 200 million streams globally in multiple weeks.

	Below is a look at all six weeks in which songs have topped 200 million streams worldwide; one belongs to BLACKPINK and now two to the group’s ROSÉ:

	“APT.” introduces ROSÉ’s solo studio album, rosie, due Dec. 6.

	Lady Gaga and Mars’ “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200, following eight weeks at No. 1, the most for any song this year. It drew 126 million streams (up 4%) worldwide Oct. 25-31 (aided by three new mixes and sale-pricing) and has tallied over 100 million streams globally in each of the last nine weeks, the most in a row since The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber’s “Stay” also linked nine triple-digit weeks in August-October 2021.

	










	The Global 200’s top five is stationary, rounded out by Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” at No. 3, following three weeks at No. 1 beginning in August; Oscar Maydon and Fuerza Regida’s “Tu Boda” at its No. 4 high; and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” at No. 5, after three nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June.

	Tyler, the Creator also collects his first Global 200 top 10, as “St. Chroma,” featuring Daniel Caesar, debuts at No. 10 with 42 million global streams. Notably, the song was released Oct. 28 and amassed its streaming sum from just four days during the tracking week. It’s from his new album, Chromakopia, which debuts at No. 1 on the U.S.-based Billboard 200. Caesar adds his second Global 200 top 10, after Justin Bieber’s “Peaches,” on which he and Giveon are featured, led for two weeks in 2021.

	“APT.” concurrently rules Global Excl. U.S. for a second week, with 187 million streams (down 6%) and 12,000 sold (down 40%) outside the U.S. Oct. 25-31.

	As on the Global 200, “Die With a Smile” ranks at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S. following eight weeks at No. 1.

	










	Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” keeps at No. 3 on Global Excl. U.S., after three weeks at No. 1 beginning in August, and Oscar Maydon and Fuerza Regida’s “Tu Boda” rises 5-4 for a new high.
