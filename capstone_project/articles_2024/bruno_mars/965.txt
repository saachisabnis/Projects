 GD had an 80% average nomination prediction accuracy as a community, that’s an A
Honey, your math is NOT mathing.  80% is a B.

Thats US grading system. For us, 70% is A and relatively difficult to achieve. Guess I just used our grading.

I was sold on DWAS winning both SOTY and ROTY. But since it was snubbed from Record, I think it’s in a risky place here… Of course the song can still win, but I’m not so sure anymore.
Billie is such a strong contender and Chappell might upset as well.
1. “Die with a Smile” (Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars)
2. “BIRDS OF A FEATHER” (Billie Eilish)
3. “Not Like Us” (Kendrick Lamar)
DWAS missing ROTY was shocking, especially since it fits the mold of a winner. However, this allows voters to strategically split their votes. The song easily stands out from a lineup of 8 as the baity 70s-inspired duet smash by two of Pop’s biggest names. I’m predicting DWAS to pull a “Somebody That I Used to Know,” winning Pop Duo + the one GF category it’s nominated in. Funny how it turned out cause I would view “Used to Know” as a SOTY and DWAS as a ROTY.
Uptown Funk missed SOTY and took ROTY & Pop Duo TBF. Maybe it was blocked by a committee though. But Bruno never gets into categories like music video, yet he takes whatever he’s nominated for. Let’s see how this goes.

I also don’t count Good Luck Babe out. It’s a unique song about a queer girl doesn’t want to come out and broke up with her girlfriend aka Chappell herself. That’s a good theme also Dan was in POTY too.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.
I had no idea, that’s an interesting narrative. Adopting drag makes sense business-wise, since gay boys consume music more than any demo on this planet.

Honey, initially, I ruled out “Good Luck, Babe!.”  I’m having second thoughts about it now.
Good Luck Babe could win. It’s a well written funny pop hit with good message. It would be a similar choice to About Damn Time. I have it in my Top 3 predictions with Die With A Smile and Birds Of A Feather.
I can’t stand Chappel but I’d love a GLB! win here. It would be so inspired.
I take that back, her annoying ass deserves nothing!

now wait for some user to say she’s a breath of fresh air 🤦🏽‍♂️
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
GLB would be a fantastic R/SOTY winner. I hope Chappell can pull off those wins. Like I’ve said before, she’s deserving of a sweep.

I mean there were also less nominees then
