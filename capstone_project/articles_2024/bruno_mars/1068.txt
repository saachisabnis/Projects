10x GRAMMY Award-winner Chris Stapleton returned to NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” for the third time as musical guest this past weekend, performing his songs “White Horse” and “Mountains Of My Mind.” Stapleton also joined host Ryan Gosling and cast members Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman and Chloe Troast for a musical comedy sketch, “Get That Boy Back.” Watch HERE.
The appearance adds to yet another triumphant year for Stapleton, who is nominated for five awards at this year’s 59th Annual ACM Awards: Entertainer of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, Album of the Year (Higher, as artist and producer) and Artist-Songwriter of the Year.
Additionally, Stapleton won two awards at the 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards earlier this year—Best Country Solo Performance (“White Horse”) and Best Country Song (“White Horse”)—and recently earned his fourth #1 single at country radio as “White Horse” topped the MediaBase Country Airplay chart. “White Horse” is from Stapleton’s new album, Higher, which was released this past fall to overwhelming critical acclaim (Mercury Nashville, stream/purchase here). Produced by Dave Cobb, Morgane Stapleton and Chris Stapleton, the album was recorded at Nashville’s RCA Studio A and landed on several “Best of 2023” lists including Rolling Stone, Billboard, Esquire, Vulture and many more.
Known for his electric live performances, the 10x GRAMMY, 16x CMA and 15x ACM Award-winner is in the midst of his extensive “All-American Road Show,” which includes upcoming stops at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl (two nights), Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena (two nights), Philadelphia’s Freedom Mortgage Pavilion and Arlington’s Globe Life Field as well as dates across the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. He will also join George Strait for several stadium shows this year. See below for complete tour itinerary.
One of the country’s most respected and beloved musicians, Stapleton was named Entertainer of the Year at last year’s 58th ACM Awards—resulting in a prestigious ACM Triple Crown Award—and was named Male Vocalist of the Year for the seventh time at the 57th CMA Awards this past fall, breaking his own record for most wins ever in the category. Additionally, he performed the National Anthem at 2023’s Super Bowl LVII and has collaborated in recent years with Adele, Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Justin Timberlake, P!nk, Sheryl Crow, Santana and many more.
Higher follows 2020’s acclaimed Starting Over, which won three awards at the 67th Annual GRAMMYs: Best Country Album, Best Country Solo Performance (“You Should Probably Leave”) and Best Country Song (“Cold”) in addition to earning Album of the Year honors at both the CMA and ACM Awards. Called a “a sure-footed masterpiece” by the Associated Press, the album landed on “Best of 2020” lists at NPR Music, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Esquire, Vulture, The Tennessean and The New York Times, who declared, “Chris Stapleton’s roar isn’t designed to scare you off. It’s regal, an announcement of an alpha figure asserting his primacy…on this, his fourth album, the thrill is back.” Prior to Starting Over, Stapleton released a pair of Platinum-certified releases in 2017—From A Room: Volume 1 and From A Room: Volume 2—as well as his x5 Platinum breakthrough solo debut album in 2015, Traveller.
In addition to their work as musicians, the Stapletons are founders of the Outlaw State of Kind charitable fund, which supports a variety of causes that are close to their heart. Stapleton also recently unveiled his new Traveller Whiskey, a first-of-its-kind collaboration created in partnership with Buffalo Trace Distillery’s Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley.

Progressive jam giants Umphrey's McGee‘s return to Las Vegas for the seventh installment of the massively popular UMBowl production was marked once again by a stand-out tour closing dual evening extravaganza where all stops were pulled out and the power given directly to the fans, for better or for worse.
On June 24, Round Records & ATO Records will release GarciaLive Volume Six: July 5, 1973 – Jerry Garcia & Merl Saunders, the latest installment of the celebrated GarciaLive archival series. The three-CD set was recorded at the 200 capacity Lion’s Share club formerly located in the small town of San Anselmo, CA, just 20 miles north of San Francisco. The performance features Jerry Garcia performing with friend, mentor and legendary keyboardist/vocalist Merl Saunders. The duo is joined by drummer Bill Vitt and bassist John Kahn, who soon became a lifelong Garcia collaborator.
