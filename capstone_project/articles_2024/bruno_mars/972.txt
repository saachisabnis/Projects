We're learning more about Lady Gaga's highly-anticipated forthcoming album dropping next year.
Mother Monster sat down with the Los Angeles Times for an interview published Thursday (December 19) where she shared some new info about her upcoming yet-to-be-titled album, currently known as LG7, which is set to come out in February, per People. The album will be her first studio alum since 2020's Chromatica, not including her Joker: Folie à Deux companion album Harlequin that came out in September ahead of the film's release.
According to the "Born This Way" singer, the new project doesn't settle on just one genre, instead featuring "so many different styles, so many different dreams."
"It leaps around genre in a way that's almost corrupt. And it ends with love. That's the answer to all the chaos in my life is that I find peace with love," she said, adding, "Every song that I wrote, I just kept getting kind of swept away in these different dreams I was having about the past — almost like a recollection of all these bad decisions that I made in my life."
She reassured that despite the rollercoaster of emotions, the album "ends in this very happy place."
Gaga also confirmed that "Die with a Smile," her Grammy-nominated duet with Bruno Mars, will also be featured on the project, describing the record as "this missing piece" that became a "huge part" of the album. Additionally, she dropped the album's lead single, "Disease," in October.
