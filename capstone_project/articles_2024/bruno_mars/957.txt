Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany Mahomes are expecting their third baby. 
Patrick and Brittany, a former college soccer player, are already parents of two adorable kids. The couple announced via Instagram that they are making room for one more, in a post liked by Taylor Swift herself. (Swift is dating Mahomes' teammate, Travis Kelce.)
The family shared some video outtakes from a photoshoot featuring Patrick, Brittany, 3-year-old daughter Sterling Skye, 1-year-old son Patrick “Bronze” Lavon ... and ultrasound photos of the new baby. 
The family, all dressed up in shades of white, posed, danced, snuggled and smiled in the video that is set to the song "Count on Me" by Bruno Mars. 
The parents captioned the video simply, "Round three, here we come 🤍"
There's no due date listed. 
The family has posted some sweet family announcements and memories through the years.
The couple used their dogs, Steel and Silver, to announce their oldest child's gender. The dogs walked down a runway and left pink paw prints behind to signal the arrival of a baby girl.
The couple announced their daughter's arrival with matching Instagram posts, featuring a photo of the newborn clutching her parents’ fingers while mom Brittany donned a sparkly nameplate necklace that read “Sterling.”
In May 2022, the couple announced via Instagram their family was growing and that Sterling would be a big sister.
“Round 2,” they wrote alongside family photos of their little girl holding up a sign that read, “Big sister duties coming soon.” Sterling donned a shirt that read “I have a secret to tell you” for the family announcement.
For that gender reveal Instagram video, the duo squirted water guns filled with blue liquid, indicating a boy.
Whether this new baby is a boy or a girl, it's certainly a win for the Mahomes family.
