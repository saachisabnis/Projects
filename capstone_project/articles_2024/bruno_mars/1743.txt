The six-figure win was one of several recent jackpots at casinos across the Las Vegas Valley.
That’s one way to pay for a vacation.
Gregorey Morey, a tourist from Michigan, played a Journey to the Planet Moolah machine and won a slots jackpot worth $516,008.46 on Sunday at Emerald Island in Henderson, the casino said in a release.
“All we could hear is his shouts of, ‘I am rich,’” casino general manager Tim Brooks said in the release.
