Yesterday (June 6), people noticed that Hulk Hogan was promoting a cryptocurrency that seemed to bear his name on his X/Twitter account. That in and of itself didn’t seem that weird — certainly not to any of us old enough to remember Pastamania. But the posts on X also included some trash talk of Australian rapper/model Iggy Azalea and her cryptocurrency that seemed odd, even for Hogan.
The Hulkster later posted an Instagram that the tweets were “not from him” and would be “promptly removed”. 
Deleting the $HULK tweets would have been fine, and totally understandable. Instead, Hogan and his team seem to have nuked his entire account, getting rid of everything ever sent from it. And that means the greatest tweet of all-time is gone.

Folks are pointing out this isn’t the only legendary missive from HH that will now only exist in screenshot form. There’s also the exchange where Jackass’ Bam Margera had to tell Hulk he wasn’t dead...
My favorite tweet of the decade is when Hulk Hogan thought Bam Margera died. pic.twitter.com/9peFg2XmTG
... and just last year when the WWE Hall of Famer ran out of toilet paper. So many classics, now gone.
It’s a tough beat for the wrestle web, but something tells me us jabronie marks without a life will get through it together.
