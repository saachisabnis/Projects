Lady Gaga is back and ready to dominate the charts with her latest single, “Disease,” from her much-anticipated LG7 album. This release is a big moment for Gaga fans—it’s her first solo pop track in years, and it’s already giving us a taste of the new era she has in store.
Gaga’s powerhouse vocals and catchy lyrics shine through, especially in the chorus: “I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease / If you were a sinner, I could make you believe / Lay you down like one, two, three / Eyes roll back with ecstasy / I know all your secrets, I can cure your / Cure your disease.”
The track promises a bold, captivating energy that’s classic Gaga, while exploring some new sounds for her fans. And with her seventh solo studio album set to release in 2025, fans are thrilled for what’s next.
Although “Disease” is her first pop single in a while, Gaga has kept us well-fed with other musical projects. Earlier this year, she released “Happy Mistake” for Joker: Folie à Deux and teamed up with Bruno Mars for the duet “Die With a Smile” over the summer.
This new single marks a strong start to her LG7 era, and fans are buzzing with excitement for what’s to come. With “Disease” out now, Lady Gaga is proving that she’s still the reigning queen of reinvention.
Check out the lyrics: 
[Intro]
(Ah)
(Ah)
[Verse 1]
There are no more tears to cry
I heard you beggin’ for life
Runnin’ out of medicine
You’re worse than you’ve ever been
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Screamin’ for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you’re gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight
(Ah-ah) Screamin’ for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you’re gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight
[Chorus]
I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya (Cure)
Cure your disease
[Verse 2]
You’re so tortured when you sleep
Plagued with all your memories
You reach out, and no one’s there
Like a god without a prayer
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Screamin’ for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you’re gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight
(Ah-ah) Screamin’ for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you’re gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight
[Chorus]
I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya (Cure)
Cure your disease
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah)
(Ah) Cure your disease
(Ah)
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya
[Chorus]
Bring me your desire, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I know all your secrets, I can cure ya, oh
Cure your disease
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah) Cure your disease
(Ah) Cure ya
(Ah)
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya
I can cure your disease
(Ah) Cure your disease
(Ah) Cure your disease
(Ah) Ooh
(Ah) Ooh
