Strictly Come Dancing fans have joked that someone deserves 'jail time' as they made the same complaint about the show's judges. It was week seven of the BBC One dance contest as the hit show returned to screens on Saturday night (November 2).
There was a first for Strictly as they introduced the first-ever Icons Week to mark the much-loved dance programme's 20th anniversary.
It saw the remaining 10 celebrities and their professional dance partners take to the ballroom floor to perform a routine accompanied by a track from a well-known singer or band with George Michael, Madonna, The Beatles and Bruno Mars among them.

First though, all eyes were on the judges as they went all out to mbrace the new theme, with Motsi Mabuse channelling Tina Turner, Shirley Ballas coming in as Cher, Craig Revel Horwood portrayed Bee Gees' Barry Gibb while Anton Du Beke took on Rod Stewart
The couples meanwhile, also arrived into the ballroom in all manner of fancy dress with Chris McCausland sporting KISS face-paint, Pete Wicks rocking Freddie Mercuryâ€™s moustache and Jamie Borthwick donning George Michael classic Ray-Bans.
But minutes into the show it was all about the judges and there was clearly a divide. As some viewers flocked to social media to complain about the inclusion of the foursome's own dancing moment during the grand entrance, others were praising their costume efforts.
