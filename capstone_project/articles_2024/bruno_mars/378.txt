Stops on the new trek include Birmingham, Omaha, Ann Arbor, Memphis, Portland, Norfolk and more through May 3. General on-sale for the dates will be available on Friday, Dec. 6 and details can be found at flatlandcavalry.com/tour.
The tour adds to a notable year for the band, who released their new album, Flatland Forever, last month via Interscope Records and recently reached No. 1 on Shazam’s U.S. Top 200 chart after their song “How Long” was featured in the hit show Yellowstone. Receiving over 81,000 Shazams, the song surpassed tracks by Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, The Weekend & Playboi Carti and more.
Over the past year, Flatland Cavalry also wrote and recorded songs for two major film soundtracks (Twisters and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes), received their first ACM Awards nomination for Group of the Year and garnered more than 500 million streams across platforms.
