Fans have been desperately waiting to see when Lady Gaga will finally drop her much anticipated seventh album, LG7.
The Joker star has been happily dating her fiancé Michael Polansky but that doesn’t mean she’s stayed away from the recording studio.
As Vogue’s October cover star, the Applause hitmaker revealed she had been working away on both a new album and a secret project this year.
Gaga is almost ready for us to hear her brand new music as she confirmed the record would drop in February 2025.
This comes after she casually revealed the first single would be arriving in October, while at the Venice Film Festival.
Gaga posted a picture of her schedule for the week ahead of the premiere of Joker: Folie et Deux and eagle-eyed fans a tease for ‘LG7 first single’ — which is due ‘XX October’.
Gaga shared: ‘For a long time, for most of my career, my life was controlled by this business: what people wanted from me; what they hoped I could achieve; how to keep me going. And that can be a lot of pressure and it’s scary. But I feel like I’m finally coming out on the other side.’
In the chat, Gaga, 38, also confirmed LG7 would be a pop album; possibly more in line with Fame than Chromatica, which she said was born of a ‘dark time’.
She pinpoints the 2020 album as the last time fans connected with her through music but admits mentally it was a tough time.
During it all, she found comfort in now fiancé Michael, who is apparently the reason she is pursuing pop once more.
‘I had never met anyone like Michael,’ she continued. ‘He’s so smart and so kind. And his life and my life are very different. He’s a very private guy and he’s not with me for any other reason than that we are right for each other. 
‘But I think what I want my fans to know is that I’m just, like, so happy. I’m healthy. I feel like the last time they heard from me—in this way—was Chromatica, and that album was about an absolutely horrible time for me with my mental health. I was in a really dark place. 
‘I struggled for, like, many years before that. But everything started to change. Because I had a real friend who saw the ways in which I was unhappy and why. And he wasn’t afraid to truly hold my hand. And get to know me. On a very deep level.’
Michael added that he saw a ‘fire’ in Gaga when she was on the Chromatica tour which he wanted to encourage and support.
While we still don’t have an official title for the upcoming album, it will reach fans’ ears in February with a sneaky single to be dropped next month.
Despite being busy with her acting career, Gaga did release one song with Bruno Mars last month called Die With A Smile but it’s not believed this will feature on her album.
When that track was released, she explained: ‘I was finishing up my own album in Malibu and one night after a long day he asked me to come to his studio to hear something he was working on. 
‘It was around midnight when I got there and I was blown away when I heard what he had started making. We stayed up all night and finished writing and recording the song.’
Fans have been waiting for confirmation of LG7 after the Poker Face hitmaker dropped numerous hints that new music was on the way.
She has been sharing snaps from inside the studio for months now but no further information has been revealed until now.
Little else is known about this upcoming album, although it’s suspected Grammy-winning writer and producer Andrew Watt could be involved.
He shared a post when Die With A Smile was released, adding to rumours he might be producing tracks for LG7.
In another picture which circulated online, Gaga’s longtime collaborator Bloodpop and vocal producer Benjamin Rice could be seen in the studio.
She had captioned a studio snap on Instagram: ‘Just me in the studio – happy as ever making music. Feel so grateful, heart is peaceful. 
‘It’s like meditation. I can’t wait for you to hear what I’m working on.’
Gaga didn’t share any extra message beyond her teasing schedule but fans immediately went wild for the new music reveal.
‘OCTOBER WHAT,’ screamed the official MTV Instagram account in her comments as singer Palettes replied: ‘Please hold me. I’m about to faint.’
‘FIRST SINGLE?!?!’ asked Carter James as Carlos Gonzales added: ‘OMG . Halloween Queen ❣️🐈‍⬛.’
Rebecca Black (yes, that Rebecca Black) simply commented ‘OH’.
Gaga has been a staple of the charts since her debut in the last 00s with album The Fame – later re-released as The Fame Monster.
She is one of the bestselling artists of all time, with 13 Grammy Awards to her name as well as acting accolades.
Until the Rain on Me hitmaker makes another announcement, we will all be waiting impatiently for October to roll around.
