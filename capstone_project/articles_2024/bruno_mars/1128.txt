From one collaboration to another, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars have knocked Chase & Status and Stormzy’s D&B banger off the Number 1 spot!
It’s safe to say that the Little Monsters have been waiting for new Lady Gaga music for a VERY long time, and she did not disappoint with this stunning ballad accompanied by the legend that is Bruno Mars.

Some fans have theorised that the song could feature on the soundtrack of Gaga’s upcoming film, ‘Joker: Folie à Deux’, which is released on 4th October.
In a post on Instagram, Gaga shared her happiness at fans’ reaction to the song, saying, “watching fans from all over the world celebrate this music has meant so much to me”.

We’re still waiting for LG7 though…
Elsewhere in the chart, we’ve got new entries from Sabrina Carpenter and Coldplay. Sabrina’s new bop ‘Taste’ from her newly-released album ‘Short n’ Sweet’ made it to Number 7. Coldplay’s mega collaboration with Little Simz, Burna Boy, Elyanna and Tini, ‘We Pray’ comes in at Number 2.
Hozier, Rag’n’Bone Man and Clementine Douglas & Duke Dumont also had new songs enter the Top 40.
