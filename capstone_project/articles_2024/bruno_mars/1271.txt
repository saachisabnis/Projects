Style: Pop, Punk
Canadian singer and songwriter Sam Louis describes himself as an “emotional curator.” That’s an interesting turn of phrase—to curate one’s emotions, presumably through the medium of song. But then, when you really drill down, we suppose that’s what all art is doing to some degree. 
He also describes himself as pop and punk, rather than pop-punk. That’s a bit of a stretch, but ok. He’s certainly much closer to the pop end of that spectrum than punk, with soulful artists such as Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars obvious references. Louis has the tunes and the voice, and the production here is exemplary.
