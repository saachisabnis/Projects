Bruno Mars first fell in love with Vegas as a child. He has been doing residencies in Las Vegas for years now, and he just opened his own nightclub, The Pinky Ring, at the Bellagio.  “If you look at the Pinky Ring, I’ve been working on that for years. A lot of things had to get shuffled around in order for that to happen. I’ve got a lot of plans, especially in regards to Vegas, and I’m just getting started. That’s what I’ve got to say, OK? Just wait to see what I do next,” he said in a new interview. "I love the lore that I am a Las Vegas lounge singer in debt to the mob. I can work with that.” Have you seen a Vegas residency? If so, for which artist?
