Maridanielys, who goes by Mari, is a vibrant young lady who is adored by all who know her. Described as enthusiastic and engaging with a smile that melts the heart, Mari is very in-tune with her surroundings and is highly motivated by interactions with familiar people. Her wonderful sense of humor and cheerful disposition endear her to everyone she meets. Mari enjoys being read to, having her hair and nails done and spending time outside. She also loves singing, dancing and music videos...especially anything by Justin Timberlake or Bruno Mars!
Mari's adoption social worker, Michael, describes her as a "Super happy person, always smiley, loves giving thumbs up and saying 'hi'."
She likes music, dancing, Disney movies and princesses.
Medical Needs
Mari needs 24 hour care.  She is supported through a G tube for feeding, uses a wheelchair and a body brace.  Her environment has to be supportive of these medical needs, and the ideal family would have the time and the resources to support these needs.
Mari's ideal family would be "in it for the long run," says Michael.
