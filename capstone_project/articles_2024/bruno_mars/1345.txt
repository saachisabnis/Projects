“Special Spice,” a soulful song set to enchant visitors in the highly anticipated Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, blends the vibrant spirit of New Orleans with the beloved characters from Disney’s The Princess and the Frog. This track, composed and written by Grammy Award-winning artist PJ Morton, captures the essence of community, individuality, and celebration. The song is performed by Anika Noni Rose, who reprises her role as Princess Tiana.
“Special Spice” stands out as a pivotal element of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, set to open soon at Walt Disney World and later this year at Disneyland Resort. The song is not only performed by Anika but also by members of a jazz band at the ride’s conclusion, featuring characters like Louis, Ray, and Mama Odie. This lively performance promises to be a joyous finale to the magical journey.
During our conversation at the preview event, Anika Noni Rose expressed her excitement about the song and the ride. When asked who she would love to see on a remix of “Special Spice,” she enthusiastically replied, “Ummm, I’d say Bruno Mars—I know he would put some stank on it.” The idea of a collaboration with Bruno Mars adds an extra layer of excitement to the already captivating track.
Anika also shared what constitutes the “special spice” in her life, helping her prepare for new challenges. “Oh, I think that the special spice in my life may be nothing more exciting than determination. It’s just continuing, just getting up every day and doing whatever it is again and again and again. In spite of the no’s or the may-says.”
The lyrics of “Special Spice” beautifully encapsulate the core themes of The Princess and the Frog, reflecting resilience and celebration. This message of persistence mirrors the journey of Princess Tiana herself, making the song an anthem of hope and joy.
Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, with “Special Spice” at its heart, is set to become a must-visit attraction for Disney fans and music lovers alike. The soundtrack is available now on Walt Disney Records across all streaming platforms, allowing everyone to experience the magic of New Orleans and the spirit of Tiana’s journey.
Prepare to be captivated by “Special Spice” and the enchanting experience of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure at Walt Disney World, opening today, and at Disneyland Resort, opening later this year. The song, and the dream of a Bruno Mars remix, promise to keep the magic alive both in the parks and beyond.
