YG Entertainment shares gained 4.3% this week as “APT” by ROSÉ and Bruno Mars continued its hot streak. A week after YG’s stock gained 6.1% following the track’s blockbuster start on streaming services, the track topped both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. ROSÉ, a member of YG recording artist BLACKPINK, released “APT” through Atlantic Records in partnership with THEBLACKLABEL, a YG sub-label co-founded in 2015 by BLACKPINK producer Teddy Park. While YG continues to manage BLACKPINK, ROSÉ signed with THEBLACKLABEL for the management of her solo career.

	Universal Music Group (UMG) shares fell 0.7% over the week but gained 1.6% to 23.45 euros ($25.52) on Friday (Nov. 1) following the company’s third-quarter earnings the prior day. Morgan Stanley raised its price target to 35 euros ($38) from 33 euros ($35.90). “Our conviction on UMG is as high as it’s ever been,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in an investor note. Guggenheim called UMG’s third-quarter results “encouraging” and maintained a 25.50 euros ($27.74) price target and its “neutral” rating on UMG shares.

	SiriusXM gained 4.7% to $27.65 after the company’s third-quarter earnings release on Thursday (Oct. 31) showed a net gain of 14,000 self-pay subscribers in the quarter. Despite the uptick, average revenue per user fell due to a “higher proportion of subscribers on self-pay promotional and streaming-only plans,” the company said.

	Deezer shares gained 2.1% to 1.43 euros ($1.56) after the company’s third-quarter earnings showed 11% revenue growth and a 9% uptick in subscribers. New CEO Alexis Lanternier sounded upbeat about partnerships with MeLi+ and Mercado Libre, which has converted free trials at a rate “higher than our expectations,” in his words. Still, Deezer’s share price is down 32.9% year to date.  

	Reservoir Media fell 3.5% to $8.25 following its earnings release on Wednesday (Oct. 30) which showed solid 6% revenue growth. The stock did not get a bump from Reservoir’s slightly upgraded full-year guidance nor B. Riley’s increase of its price target to $12.50 from $11.50.

	The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) was essentially flat for the week, rising 0.3% to 1,995.67 despite having just seven gainers as opposed to 13 stocks that lost ground. The small increase brought the index’s year-to-date gain to 30.1% and reversed the BGMI to the win category after it dropped 0.6% the prior week, breaking a streak of six consecutive weeks of gains. 

	Even a small gain outperformed many major stock indexes. In the United States, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.5% to 18,329.92 and the S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,728.80. Both indexes rose on Friday, however, as investors paid little attention to a weak jobs report and both Amazon and Intel jumped after reporting quarterly earnings. On Thursday (Oct. 31), Meta and Microsoft shares fell following their respective earnings reports, with Meta dropping 3% and Microsoft falling more than 5%. 

	Music streamer LiveOne was the greatest gainer of the week after jumping 32.8% to $0.77. The company announced on Thursday that it has engaged MZ Group to increase the visibility of PodcastOne in the investment community. LiveOne spun off PodcastOne in 2023 and retained an 81% stake. Investors may have taken note of MZ Group’s Chris Donovan’s statement that PodcastOne “owns intellectual property that can be sold for a significant return on investment.” 

	Outside of YG Entertainment, the other four K-pop stocks lost ground. HYBE fell 3.1% and increased its year-to-date loss to 20.0%. JYP Entertainment fell 4.2%. SM Entertainment slipped 0.7%. Collectively, the four K-pop companies’ share prices are down 28.6% in 2024.

	iHeartMedia jumped 16.1% to $2.09 a week before the company reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday (Nov. 7). Another radio company, Cumulus Media, dropped 19.0% to $0.94 following its release of third-quarter earnings on Friday. The company’s revenue fell 1.8% to $204 million and it saw a net loss of $10.3 million, down from a net profit of $2.7 million in the prior-year period. “Looking forward, the advertising environment remains uncertain,” warned Cumulus CEO Mary Berner.
