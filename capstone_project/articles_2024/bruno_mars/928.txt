It will mark Beyoncé's first performance of the year
Beyoncé‘s upcoming Christmas-day NFL Halftime performance won’t run for longer than other Super Bowl sets, it has been confirmed.
Last month, Netflix and the NFL announced that Beyoncé will headline the Christmas-day game Halftime Show. Earlier this week, Beyoncé fan pages on X (formerly Twitter) shared that TMZ Sports had reported that Queen Bey’s performance allocation was being “extended” past the traditional 15 minute runtime.
“A typical NFL game halftime is around 12-15 minutes… but league sources tell us that’ll be beefed up when ‘Yoncé takes the stage after the second quarter of the Houston Texans’ home matchup against the Baltimore Ravens on Dec. 25,” the post wrote. This led fans to speculate that Beyoncé would be performing for around 20 minutes.

Now, however, Beyoncé publicist has publicly decried those claims. Yvette Noel-Schure wrote on X in response to a fan page: “Untrue. Her performance will not be 20 minutes.”

While details surrounding Beyoncé’s set are being kept under wraps, Netflix revealed in November that she will be performing songs from ‘Cowboy Carter’ live for the first time.
Beyoncé last hit the road in 2023 to celebrate her ‘Renaissance’ album. Running from May to October and hitting 39 cities in 17 countries, it was one of the highest-grossing tours of all time, taking in a reported $579million (£455.7million) in revenue. Since then, she has taken a country-styled turn in her sound and released ‘Cowboy Carter’ earlier this year.

The record scored a five-star review from NME, with Jenessa Williams writing: “Even if interpreted only on the grounds of artistic spectacle, it’s an undeniable thrill to see her swing so big on a project that dares her to be so intimate and vocal-focused, while making way for country’s up-and-comers too.”
The upcoming slot for Christmas won’t be Beyoncé’s first NFL outing. She has performed at two other Halftime Shows in the past – both during the Super Bowl. In 2013, she performed with her Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Three years later, she performed again – this time alongside Coldplay and Bruno Mars.
