Since 1801, the White House has held Independence Day celebrations on its South Lawn. Activities have evolved over two centuries, including when former president James K. Polk first introduced fireworks to the event in 1845.
Today’s presidential festivities look a little different compared to the first one held by former President Thomas Jefferson, where festivities included horse races and cock fights on the north grounds of the President’s Park, according to the White House Historical Association.
Modern day celebrations include parades, concerts and cookouts on the White House lawn. From the administrations of former President George W. Bush to President Joe Biden, here’s what Independence Day at the White House has looked like over the past twenty years.
During his presidency, former President George W. Bush continued to hold long-held Fourth of July traditions at his White House celebrations, which featured cookouts and fireworks displays.
Like presidents before him, Bush attended a naturalization ceremony at Monticello in 2008, where more than 70 people from 30 countries were welcomed as new citizens. The former president also made visits to Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 2001 and West Virginia in 2002.
Former President Barack Obama’s Independence Day celebrations were marked by star-studded concerts at the White House to honor military families and veterans.
Obama’s 2015 White House Independence Day concert for military families featured a performance by musician Bruno Mars.
In 2016, Obama wrapped up his final Independence Day in the White House by throwing a concert for military veterans and administrative staff with performances by Kendrick Lamar and Janelle Monáe.
Straying from cookouts and concerts on the White House South Lawn, former President Donald Trump held his first “Salute to America,” a day-long celebration featuring parades near the National Mall, flyovers with planes used in Air Force One, and a televised speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
In 2020, Trump held another “Salute to America” celebration where the White House hosted hundreds of people on the South Lawn for music and a fireworks display.
When he assumed office, Biden followed long-held traditions during White House Independence Day celebrations, hosting the “The President’s Own” United States Marine Band, U.S. Army Band, U.S. Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, U.S. Navy Band, and U.S. Air Force Band.
In 2021, when many COVID-19 stay-at-home mandates were starting to be lifted, the White House hosted more than 1,000 visitors on the White House South Lawn for a barbeque and fireworks.
Last Fourth of July, the President held a concert for military and veteran families with performances by Ne-Yo and Brothers Osborne.
