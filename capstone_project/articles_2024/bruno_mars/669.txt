	In her Hot Ones episode teaser clips that dropped Nov. 6, ROSÉ didn’t hold back on her love for spice — though she wondered just how far she could go with the “Wings of Death.” “I like spicy food,” she said, adding, “But I don’t know if I like spicy spicy.”

	As the heat began to kick in, she joked, “By the way, my tongue is built differently. It’s built different.” 

	










	Asked about the inspiration behind her new single “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars, ROSÉ explained it was rooted in a playful cultural moment. “APT” is a tribute to a traditional Korean drinking game called “aparteu” (or “apartment” in English), and it’s also the first single from her anticipated debut album, Rosie, set for release on Dec. 6.

	“It’s a Korean drinking game APT, one, two, three, four, five, six,” she said. “Whoever gets the top takes the shot.”

	Shifting to her craft, she also discussed her vocal technique, explaining the difference between chest and head voice. “I’ve set the key too high,” she laughed, adding, “That’s the difference, I guess, right?”

	ROSÉ’s latest hit is taking the music world by storm, smashing records left and right. The catchy tune has been dominating charts globally. In a massive debut, “APT.” soared to the top spot on both Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, and held its crown for two straight weeks. 

	Down Under, ROSÉ’s Aussie fans have shown their love in spades. “APT.” rocketed to No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the first solo female K-pop artist to conquer the Aussie charts. Not only that, but she’s kept the top spot warm for multiple weeks – a feat not seen since PSY’s “Gangnam Style” back in 2012. She also set the record as the highest-ranking female K-pop artist on the U.K. Official Singles Chart at No. 2.

	In a recent PAPER Magazine interview, she discussed how online criticism inspired one of the album’s most personal tracks, stating, “I realised how vulnerable and addicted I was to this [online] world and that craving for feeling like I wanted to be loved and understood.”

	Born in Auckland and raised in Melbourne, ROSÉ moved to South Korea at 15 to pursue music, eventually joining BLACKPINK. The group’s debut studio album The Album skyrocketed to No. 2 on the Billboard 200, the highest ever for a K-pop girl group. Born Pink dropped and made history as the first album by a female Korean act to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

	










	ROSÉ has also seen previous success as a solo artist. Her 2021 single “On the Ground” was the first song by a Korean solo artist to top both Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts. She has also ranked No. 79 on Billboard’s Artist 100 chart.

	Fans can watch ROSÉ’s Hot Ones episode on Thursday at 11 AM ET to see how she handles the heat.
