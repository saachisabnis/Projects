In 2016, the world was introduced to Anderson .Paak, with the release of his critically daring and critically acclaimed LP, Malibu. Since then, .Paak has been on an unstoppable reign, from working with Dr. Dre to collaborating with Bruno Mars to rejuvenating his Nxworries project with acclaimed producer Knxwledge; .Paak has established himself as one of the hardest-working modern musicians. With the artist’s new projects popping up, it is always refreshing to return to his origins, and it appears .Paak feels the same way. Last night (September 19,) the multi-hyphenate was joined by The Free Nationals for the start of The Malibu Tour in Auburn, Washington, at the White River Amphitheater. The band will be touring across the U.S., performing Malibu in its entirety, along with some other hits according to last night’s setlist. 
.Paak and the Free Nationals stuck to their promise, starting things off with a complete run-through of Malibu, including hits like “Room in Here” and “Come Down.” Things got interesting after the final song from his 2016 LP. The Free Nationals dipped into their solo material to perform “Beauty & Essex” and “Eternal Light.” .Paak then joined the band for select cuts, including hits from later albums and some of his favorite features. The artist pulled out classics like “Make It Better” and his KAYTRANADA collaboration “Glow Up.” His collaborative work with Bruno Mars made an appearance with “Smokin’ Out The Window” being squeezed in between “RNP” (A Cordae song featuring .Paak) and a more recent collaboration with electronic producer Fred Again. The show wrapped up with a performance of “Dang,” a single from the late Mac Miller with a .Paak hook. 
Although it is The Malibu Tour, Anderson .Paak is delivering a lot more than that. With night one completed, .Paak and The Free Nationals Mountain View, California, before stopping in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. After a trip around California, the crew will make stops in Scottsdale, Denver, Chicago, and Philadelphia. You can check out the full setlist and the rest of The Malibu Tour dates below.
