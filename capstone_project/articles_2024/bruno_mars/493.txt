Reese Witherspoon's been living a big little lie. 
After Nicole Kidman questioned why Reese calls their Big Little Lies costar Laura Dern by her last name, the Legally Blonde actress had to give her pal a gentle refresher on her own moniker. 
"I hate how you call her Dern," Nicole confessed to Reese in a video for Vanity Fair published June 5, "It sounds so weird. I'm always like 'Laura,' and you're like 'No, Dern, Dern,' and I'm like, 'Why?'"
Reese quickly interrupted her pal's rant to explain the nickname, saying, "'Cause my name is Laura, and her name's Laura, and it's confusing to me."
The Morning Show star went on to remind Nicole that her birth name is Laura Jean Reese Witherspoon, which she shortened to her mother Betty's maiden name before pursuing a career in acting. 
And while Nicole, 56, admitted she "forgot" her castmates shared a first name, she still expressed some confusion over the whole situation, noting that Laura "doesn't even call you Laura, though."
Reese, 48, didn't have a rebuttal for that argument, quipping, "You're trying to understand something that just makes no sense."
Of course, Reese has been publicly going by her stage name for most of her life. After all, the Oscar winner got her start in the entertainment industry at age 7, when she starred in a florist's commercial. Seven years later, she made her feature film debut in The Man on the Moon, a role that she's previously credited with kickstarting her road to stardom. 
"I had no idea the journey that lay ahead of me," wrote Reese of the 1999 film in a 2021 Instagram, "but I am so deeply grateful for all the ups and the downs that brought me to this moment."

The This Is Us alum explained why he went by his middle name Kelby until he was a teenager.

But years after his dad died from a heart attack, Sterling decided to revert back to his first name as a way to honor his father.
"Because he passed away when I was 10, by the time I turned 16 and I hadn't heard his name for five, five-and-a-half years,” he continued. “I was like, ‘I kinda just want to hear that name again.’ So I asked people to call me Sterling."
