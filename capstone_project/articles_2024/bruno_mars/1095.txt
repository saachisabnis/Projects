After rumors circulated that Bruno Mars would need a bit of 24-karat magic to pay back the millions he reportedly owed MGM Resorts in gambling debt, the hospitality empire is clearing the air.
"We're proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world's most thrilling and dynamic performers," MGM Resorts International said in a statement provided to Business Insider. (A representative for Mars did not respond to a request for comment from BI.)
"From his shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM to the new Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio, Bruno's brand of entertainment attracts visitors from around the globe," the statement continued. "MGM and Bruno's partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect. Any speculation otherwise is completely false; he has no debt with MGM."
Rumors about Mars' gambling habits began circulating last week, when NewsNation published a report citing "a well-placed Vegas insider" who claimed Mars was making $90 million a year from his deal with the casino, but that a large portion — as much as $50 million — was being used to pay back his debts.
Mars inked a long-term deal with the hospitality empire in 2016. He kicked off his residency in December of that year, armed with a set list full of hits like "24K Magic," "Locked Out of Heaven," and "Uptown Funk."
Five years later, his residency had reportedly grossed over $50 million.
Mars is currently scheduled to perform his final show at Park MGM in Las Vegas on September 1, 2024.
