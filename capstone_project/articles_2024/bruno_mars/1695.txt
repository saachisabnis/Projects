Miley Cyrus is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit from Tempo Music Investments, alleging that her song “Flowers” copied elements of Bruno Mars’ hit “When I Was Your Man.” The lawsuit claims significant musical similarities between the two songs, including melody, harmony, and chord progressions.
Tempo Music, which owns part of the copyright for Mars’ song, argues that Miley intentionally copied Bruno’s hit and that certain lyrics in “Flowers” mirror those in the original. The company seeks financial compensation and wants Miley barred from performing or distributing “Flowers,” stating that the song wouldn’t exist without the influence of “When I Was Your Man.”
She never tried to hide the fact that it was a love letter to that song so this just seems crazy to me. People just want money. I do not like that they want her to never perform/distribute it. That means we all miss out.
Also when the song came out “When I Was Your Man” had a HUGE increase too. They already profited on that but still want more. Sad,
Important to note that Bruno Mars is not involved in the lawsuit!
