KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Patrick and Brittany Mahomes announced a threepeat is coming, and it’s not another Super Bowl title.
The family announced they are pregnant with baby number 3 by posting a video to Instagram Friday morning.
In the video, the family is wearing white and khaki. They dance around with Sterling and Bronze. Sterling runs up to the camera showing off a picture of a sonogram.
The video plays to Bruno Mars singing “Count on Me.”
Patrick and Brittany welcomed their first child, daughter Sterling Skye, on Feb. 20, 2021. Their son, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III, was born on Nov. 28, 2022.
Fans began speculating that the celebrity couple was pregnant again when they shared recent vacation pictures in Europe over the past couple of weeks.
