A centenarian American World War II veteran, along with his 96-year-old future wife from Boca Raton, Florida, plans to wed in France as part of the nation's 80th-anniversary celebration of D-Day.
Harold Terens and Jeanne Swerlin, who have been a couple since 2021, share a love for dancing, kissing, and holding hands.
Serving as a radio technician in the Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945, Terens played a part in transferring seized Germans and at large American prisoners from France to England after the events of D-Day in June 1944.
At that time, Swerlin was in high school and getting war souvenirs from soldiers trying to impress her. The couple plans to exchange vows on June 8 at a chapel near the Normandy beaches where U.S. forces made their memorable landings.
Harold Terens and his fiancée Jeanne Swerlin shared kisses and held hands reminiscent of high school lovers while talking about their forthcoming wedding in France.
The World War II veteran, who initially visited the country as a 20-year-old U.S. Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day, is now a cheerful and active 100-year-old.
In June, he will be recognized by the French as part of the 80th-anniversary commemoration of their country's freedom from the Nazis, followed by his wedding to the lively 96-year-old Swerlin close to the beaches where U.S. troops landed.

Expressing his love for Swerlin, Terens, who has been dating her since 2021, highlighted their fondness for dancing as they playfully moved to the beats of "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars.
The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City, experiencing World War II in different ways.
Terens, a radio repair technician for a P-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadron, served in Europe, while Swerlin, in high school at the time, dated soldiers and collected war souvenirs.
Terens shared his wartime experiences, including repairing planes on D-Day and a secret mission in Eastern Europe. After surviving various challenges, including dysentery and a close call in North Africa, he returned to the U.S., married his wife Thelma, and had a family.
Swerlin, on the other hand, had her own journey, being a full-time mom before becoming widowed and eventually meeting Terens through a mutual friend.
Their love story began slowly, with Terens initially not noticing Swerlin. However, after a second meeting, their connection deepened, leading to Terens proposing a few months ago.
The couple, along with their families, will travel to Paris for Terens' recognition and then head to the town of Carentan-les-Marais for their wedding on June 8.
Despite legal constraints, Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur expressed willingness to make an exception, highlighting the strong bond between Normandy and the United States due to the sacrifices made on D-Day.
