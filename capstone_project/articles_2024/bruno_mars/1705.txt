Blackpink‘s Rosé is no stranger to people playing chess with pieces on her chest or toxic exes. But is Evan Mock one of those exes or a current flame? 
Rosé released the music video to her highly anticipated single “Toxic Till The End” on December 6, 2024. Evan Mock starred as Rosé’s love interest— a young man with a dyed buzzcut who took an interest in skating. The two acted out scenes by playing chess and falling in love while even doing a kissing scene that broke the internet. They had pretty great chemistry that even “APT” collaborator Bruno Mars had to take a pause when he commented on Rosé’s Instagram, “Wait a minute. Who Tf is that?”

Neither Rosé nor Evan Mock revealed the status of their relationships. Both of them are tight-lipped about their partners, and the inspiration for the song comes from Rosé’s ex. However popular gossip social media mogul DeuxMoi confirmed that the two are indeed dating. A source told them that the “APT” singer was heard calling calling Mock her “boyfriend” and, stating, “Yes, they’re really together!”
Rosé reminisced on the creative process of “toxic til the end” on Apple Music Radio. “I would actually look at it and be like, ‘Oh my god, this was when I was going through the worst time of my life.’ I would be like, ‘I remember that tour, I had the biggest fight…you know…with the ex. I look so good considering how heartbroken I was.’”
Evan Mock reportedly dated Gray Sorrenti, who he lived with for a year according to Mr. Porter. When asked more about his relationship, the Gossip Girl actor replied, “I should probably keep that under wraps.” Meanwhile, Rosé has been in dating rumors with Kang Dong-won, which her label YG Entertainment denied. The K-pop agency told SPOTV Newson April 17. “We reveal that the dating rumors reported today regarding Rosé are not true, and we would be grateful if you could help so that information different from the facts is not circulated.” With the release of the music video, many netizens tried to snoop on who the “toxic ex” actually is. A popular theory was that it was Jaden Smith, but the mystery of the ex might live on forever.
