After 15 weeks at #1, Shaboozey‘s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” has finally been toppled — by yet another country-pop crossover star.
Morgan Wallen‘s new single, “Love Somebody,” has replaced Shaboozey on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It’s Morgan’s second #1 debut of 2024, following “I Had Some Help,” his song with Post Malone.
By ending Shaboozey’s run on top, Morgan also maintains his current record for the longest-running #1 hit of the 2020s: 16 weeks for “Last Night.”
Elsewhere on the chart, “APT.,” the joint single from Bruno Mars and BLACKPINK member ROSÉ, debuts at #8. It’s her first top 10 as a solo artist, and it outranks the highest-charting single BLACKPINK has had to date: a collab with Selena Gomez, “Ice Cream,” which peaked at #13. She’s also now the first female K-pop artist to hit the Hot 100 top 10.
Meanwhile, “APT.” is Bruno’s 20th top 10 single. Since his collab with Lady Gaga, “Die With a Smile,” is currently #4, Bruno has two top 10 hits for the first time since 2013. Back then, “When I Was Your Man” was #3 and “Locked Out of Heaven” was #10.
