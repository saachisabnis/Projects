BeyoncÃ© put on one incredible performance for the NFL Christmas Day BMW halftime show but it was her daughter, Blue Ivy, who stole the show.
The Texas Hold â€˜Em hitmaker, 43, strutted her stuff in her home town of Houston in the halftime break of the Baltimore Ravens vs Houston Texans game, which came after the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The 12-year-old star-in-the-making shocked viewers as she danced alongside her mum, keeping up with the professionals every step of the way.
Blue Ivy has been known to join her mum for a performance or two, with fans praising how far she has come since her first appearance on the Rennaissance tour.
However, it was Blue Ivyâ€™s height that really sent NFL viewers into meltdown as she appeared to be taller than BeyoncÃ©, who stands at 5â€™7.
â€˜Blue Ivy being the same height as BeyoncÃ© is making me emotional,â€™ shared one fan, EJ, on X.
Aleksa Clarke added: â€˜I had no idea she was so tall now! Wasnâ€™t she a baby 5 minutes ago?!? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­â€™
â€˜Canâ€™t believe Blue is already taller than her,â€™ said Phadyll as Ni wrote: â€˜Blue being taller than BeyoncÃ© is sending me. Why am I about to cry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.â€™
Nosi said: â€˜Blue Ivy is going to be about 6 feet by the time sheâ€™s 18 sheâ€™s so tall ðŸ˜­â€™
Itâ€™s not known exactly how tall Blue Ivy is, with recent estimates putting her between 5â€™5â€³ and 5â€™8â€³ â€” just slightly taller than her mum.
The Mufasa star was also wearing heeled cowboy boots while on stage, which appeared to be around three inches tall.
While all eyes were on Blue Ivy, BeyoncÃ© put on an incredible show as she performed her country album Cowboy Carter for the first time.
Riding a white horse â€” of course â€” backstage, BeyoncÃ© opened her set with 16 Carriages, wearing a dramatic white feathered outfit and cowboy hat.
She elegantly dismounted the horse and continued with her cover of The Beatlesâ€™ Blackbird.
BeyoncÃ© then officially arrived on the pitch wearing a white long-sleeved corset and chaps to perform with a huge brass band and dancers all around her.
The Love On Top star performed a number of her new tracks including Levi Jeans, during which she was joined by Post Malone for a duet by a pickup truck.
Jolene â€“ her cover of Dolly Partonâ€™s hit â€“ saw the megastar sing from the back of the truck, flanked by a marching band.
Then came the grand finale in Texas Hold â€˜Em, with Beyonce saying it would only be right for her to perform it for the first time in the US state and at Christmas. 
At the end of the show, Beyonce was elevated to the roof of the stadium on a platform in an impressive finale. 
Elsewhere, Mariah Carey performed her 1994 hit All I Want For Christmas Is You in a pre-recorded festive video filmed on top of a sky-scraper.
This isnâ€™t the first time Beyonce has performed during an NFL halftime show, as she took to the stage for the 2013 Super Bowl with her Destinyâ€™s Child band members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.
In 2016 she also made an appearance at Coldplayâ€™s star-studded Super Bowl performance, which also featured Bruno Mars.
This appearance comes after Beyonceâ€™s husband Jay-Z was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl with Sean â€˜Diddyâ€™ Combs.
The rapper denied accusations he raped a 13-year-old girl at the MTV Music Awards in 2000 as soon as allegations broke on December 8.
In a previous statement on X, Carter said that he and BeyoncÃ© will have to sit their children Blue Ivy, and twins Rumi and Sir, seven, down to explain the allegations â€“ which he has always denied.
â€˜My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people.Â I mourn yet another loss of innocence,â€™ he said on X.
â€˜Children should not have to endure such at their young age. It is unfair to have to try to understand inexplicable degrees of malice meant to destroy families and human spirit.
â€˜My heart and support goes out to true victims in the world, who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit.â€™
Since the lawsuit came to light, the unnamed woman has admitted to inconsistencies in her account of the night 24 years ago.
Just after the claims were made, Jay-Z took to the red carpet with Beyonce and their daughter Blue to celebrate her film debut in The Lion King: Mufasa, putting on a united front.
