Apparently, dating Travis Kelce is kinda like having a boyfriend who doubles as a personal security guard, and Taylor Swift's family is here. for. it.
A source tells the Daily Mail that "Taylor’s family and everyone who knows her is so relieved by her relationship with Travis—not only because she is madly in love but also because he makes her security personnel job much easier."
"Travis is a big dude and no one would mess with him because, when it comes to Taylor, he would not play if someone tried to come near her," the source added. "She has a built-in bodyguard at all times. Travis has vowed to keep her safe and there is no doubt about this. No one will try to come close to her when she is holding hands with her powerhouse boyfriend."
Apparently Travis was upset about a recent alleged incident between Scott Swift and a pap in Australia—which Taylor's rep spoke out about, saying "Two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water."
"Travis wishes he had been with Taylor when her dad got into it with the photographer as he wants to protect her at all costs," another insider tells the Daily Mail. "He can't wait for her to be back in the States so they can be together—and if anyone tries anything, he knows that photographers, or anyone else for that matter, wouldn't dare come close to them if he was around as he is a very massive and intimidating guy."
