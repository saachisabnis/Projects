One Taylor Swift fan has come up with an idea of how the singer-songwriter will incorporate her new music into the Eras World Tour.
Swift is on a break from her tour after performing a series of record-breaking shows in Australia and Singapore, but is still busy working on her upcoming album.
She will be releasing her 11th solo studio LP, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19.
The Eras tour will then resume on May 9 in France‚Äîand fans are hoping to hear some of the songs from the new album during the concert.
One fan even went so far as to predict where in the three-hour epic show Swift might introduce the latest tracks.
"I have a theory for the "where will Taylor fit TTPD into the setlist" question.. It makes a lot of sense immediately after Bad Blood and prior to acoustics.. Taylor is well planned and TS11 Taylor is there.." the Swift fan, @bostonswiftie wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
"There's definitely a lot of logistics involved and a few changes but.. the visuals align well for a transition right after Bad Blood.There's definitely a lot of logistics involved and a few changes but.. the visuals align well for a transition right after Bad Blood.

Swift's Eras tour is comprised of 44 songs in 10 acts, each of which represents a different stage of her career.
Other fans shared their thoughts on @bostonswiftie's hypothesis, with opinions divided.
"Seriously. Stop. Taylor wont change her setlist for TTPD. At most, she'll prolly sing it at her acoustic set but she wont change her set list to add as it will require new rehearsals and changes which I dont think she'll have the time to do. Be realistic," replied one person, @_ZeeP.
Another, @KLKemp78, added: "Those of you saying no to this idea and that she will keep it simple may be selling her short. She has known for months if not from the start of the tour that this album was coming out. It's the perfect opportunity for her to market it, and she's not afraid of a challenge."
And @vortexglitter, commented: "That's what I've been saying. And keeping it simple, just a couple ttpd songs with just her and the band."
Newsweek contacted Swift's representatives by email for comment.
Swift extended her run of the Eras tour from 52 to 146 shows across five continents after it first started in March 2023. It will wrap up in December.
