Powerful photos have been released, showing Patrick and Brittany Mahomes standing at the bedside of two young children who were shot Wednesday at the Kansas City Parade.
Patrick and Brittany visited 8-year-old Melia Reyes and 10-year-old Madison Reyes at Children’s Mercy Hospital on Wednesday to lift their spirits after the harrowing ordeal. The two young girls are sisters and were reportedly in attendance at the parade with their mother, Erika Reyes, the cousin of the deceased victim, Lisa Lopez-Galvan. Both of the Reyes children underwent surgery after being shot in the legs, according to Daily Mail.

The images show Patrick and Brittany posing for photos with the young victims, as the girls smiled brightly, in awe of their very special visitors. They each received mini Kansas City Chiefs football helmets from the Mahomes.
The Reyes family issued a statement Friday, updating the condition of their daughters and thanking Patrick and Brittany Mahomes for their show of support.
“On behalf of the Reyes Family, we are incredibly grateful for the love, support, and prayers during this difficult time. Our family, along with the other families impacted by this senseless act, are still healing physically and emotionally,” they wrote in their statement, according to Daily Mail.

“We’re happy to share that our daughters, ages 8 and 10, are making good progress in their recovery from their leg injuries,” they wrote. “Both girls were shot in the legs, underwent surgery, and are currently in casts for several months.”
The severity of the situation was revealed, as it became clear that the Reyes girls were on the mend, but had a long road to recovery ahead of them.
“We will endure follow-up doctor’s visits for the next few years,” the family said, according to Daily Mail. “They are receiving physical therapy to regain their strength and mobility. While we are relieved by their progress, the emotional healing continues for all of us.” (RELATED: Taylor Swift Donates $100,000 To Family Of Deceased Kansas City Shooting Victim)
A GoFundMe page has been established to assist Melia and Madison as they begin to heal from this tragic event.
The Reyes girls were among 11 children injured during the shooting.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
