If you tune in to just one NFL game this Super Wild Card Weekend, you'll want to watch the wild Miami Dolphins vs. Kansas City Chiefs game today, the second of a terrific Saturday football doubleheader.
There's a catch though: This game won't be broadcast over-the-air on NBC or any other cable TV channel across most of the country. The Dolphins vs. Chiefs matchup is the first-ever streaming-exclusive playoff game. So if you want to watch it, you'll need a subscription to Peacock.
Here's what you need to know to watch today's Peacock-exclusive NFL Wild Card game.
The Wild Card playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs will be played on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2024 at 8:00 p.m ET (5:00 p.m. PT).  The game will stream exclusively on Peacock.
Kansas City and Miami residents can catch the game on their local NBC affiliate via cable TV or a digital TV antenna.
The Miami Dolphins vs. Kansas City Chiefs will only be available to Peacock subscribers. Fortunately, it's easy and cost-effective to subscribe to Peacock, especially now that it's on sale ahead of the game for 50% off.
Peacock offers its subscribers live streaming access to NFL games that air on NBC, Big Ten football, Premier League soccer and WWE wrestling (including formerly PPV-only events such as Wrestlemania). The streamer hosts 80,000 hours worth of recorded content to watch as well, including hit movies and TV series such as "The Office" and "Parks and Recreation." 
Peacock Premium is regularly $6 per month, or $60 per year. Right now, however, Peacock is offering a half-off deal on annual Peacock subscriptions. New subscribers can join for just $30 per year and enjoy today's Wild Card game (plus the NBC-aired game Los Angeles Rams vs. Detroit Lions tomorrow).
Not interested in keeping Peacock after watching the Dolphins vs. Chiefs game? Then we recommend signing up for the $6 per month plan, even though it's not on sale. You can easily cancel your Peacock subscription after the game.

Important dates to remember: 
Taylor Swift's NFL era: Looking back on the 2023 NFL regular season, it's clear the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season was Taylor Swift (Travis Kelce, too). Swift's appearances at NFL stadiums including Lambeau, Gillette and Arrowhead sent Swifties of all ages into a frenzy that nearly overwhelmed the league itself. Football purists found the intrusion and Swift-related attention unnerving, but the pop sensation brought millions of new fans to the game. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be going strong, which means fans can expect to see Taylor herself in the stands of Kansas City Chiefs playoff games as her schedule allows. Football fans may find it slightly annoying. But if the attention (and new audience) Taylor brought to professional NFL football just by showing up wasn't proof enough, it's Taylor's world and we're all just living in it -- one era at a time.
Is this the Cowboys year?  Being a Dallas Cowboys fan requires a Texas-sized emotional commitment. Last season, fans gutted through quarterback Dak Prescott's winning record (not in a good way) of most interceptions thrown in the 2022-2023 season. Dak whittled his interceptions down this season and the Cowboys managed the unthinkable -- they toppled the mighty Philadelphia Eagles from their perch atop the NFC East in Week 14. But the Cowboys' 31-10 upset loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15 is the kind of play that makes Cowboys fans weary. The Cowboys could go all the way to the Super Bowl this season, but it won't be without taking fans on an emotional rollercoaster best left at an amusement park.
