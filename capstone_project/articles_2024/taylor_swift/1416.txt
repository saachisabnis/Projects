Maybe by the end of this article, we'll learn that misspelled road signs, Taylor Swift, and rigging an election are all related, or, maybe we will just laugh at Michigan road signs.
Social media has a way of bringing things back to life. Facebook sends out reminders all the time from your previous posts.
Now and then social media will bring up some memory gold with something from our past that is still just as funny as when it originally happened.
I know it's 2024, but in 2022 near Coopersville, Michigan, a couple of road signs were printed, delivered, and hung up by a road crew that were misspelled.
There was the Grand Radips sign that should have read Grand Rapids on 96 near Coopersville.
Ironically, the misspelled Cooperville sign went up while the Grand Radips sign was hung. You would think a person sending the lines to the printer would double check the copy, the printer would notice, or how about the Michigan road crew who had to hang up the signs? Regardless as to why, the misspelled signs are still producing some fun content on social media.
The very first post from Caleb Joy sparked something regarding the "Gd Rapids" and "Gd River" signs and how your GPS would say them as if it was cursing, "G-D Rapids and G-D River."
There are nearly 800 replies to this post and many with photos of other misspelled road signs. If you have some time to burn on the internet and want to laugh there are lots of good laughs on the thread posted here.
