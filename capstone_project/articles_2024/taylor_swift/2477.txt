Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.

Correction: screaming!
Travis Kelce is currently in Singapore visiting Taylor Swift on the Eras Tour, and the couple were spotted having a PDA moment at the mall by fans. And the pics! They are! Cute!
Taylor and Travis were also seen having dinner with Tay's band and backup singers, and naturally the entire restaurant was there to document it:
Meanwhile, Travis was also seen at Taylor's show:
Though nothing beats this footage of him dancing to Taylor singing "Karma is a guy on the Cheifs."
Just FYI, a source recently chatted to Us Weekly about Taylor and Travis, saying “Travis and Taylor are still in the ‘honeymoon’ phase and the relationship is serious. They are on the same page about the future but are not rushing marriage or the next step. Travis is going the extra mile to make sure he is showing support for Taylor during his off time. He is so happy he can be there for her, and show up for her even during the international leg of her tour.”
The source adds that “Both of their families love them as a couple and Taylor has become even more close with Travis’ mom. Taylor has really been integrated into the family.” Oh, and Tay "enjoyed" getting to know Kylie Kelce and Brittany Mahomes, who have "have fully embraced her."
Taylor has a two month break from the Eras tour starting right about now, so expect her and Travis to spend some quality time together now that they finally have time off at the same, uh, time!
