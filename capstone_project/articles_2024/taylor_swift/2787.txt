This is a story George Santos knows all too well.
The truth-challenged former Long Island Rep. predicted that Taylor Swift would back President Biden’s reelection bid — because the pop star’s songs are sometimes about “choosing the wrong guy.” 
“I see @taylorswift13 endorsing @JoeBiden for president. I mean I see how this makes sense since 95% of her songs are about choosing the wrong guy. I guess we can all expect a Taylor Swift revenge song on Biden in 2025,” Santos mused on X.
Rumors have swirled about Swift endorsing Biden in the 2024 presidential election cycle, as she did in 2020. 
Conspiracy theories about the singer’s possible endorsement sent social media aflutter ahead of Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, where Swift’s boyfriend, Kansas City Chief’s tight end Travis Kelce, helped his team to victory. 
Some prominent conservatives fanned the flames of theories that a psyop was underway during the feted football event to propel Biden back into the White House. 
Earlier this month, Swift urged her roughly 283 million followers on Instagram to vote in the Super Tuesday election. 
“I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power,” she wrote. 
Santos previously stated that his favorite song by the megastar is “I Knew You Were Trouble,” during a video posted to Cameo last year. 
The scandal-plagued former congressman has a history of causing trouble for his party. Last December, the House of Representatives took the rare step of expelling him. 
Santos is facing over two dozen criminal counts and is infamously a serial liar who fabricated large swaths of his personal backstory such as his alma mater and career.
But that didn’t stop him from returning to the Capitol during Biden’s State of the Union address earlier this month, which he had access to despite his expulsion. 
Santos later announced plans to challenge Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) for New York’s 1st Congressional District.
