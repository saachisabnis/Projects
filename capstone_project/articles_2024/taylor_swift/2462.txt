UNDATED (WKRC/CNN Newsource) - Top-selling artists make millions of dollars from streaming platforms every year -- and now, you could have a piece of the pie.
Music investing startup JKBX is offering the general public the chance to buy shares linked to streaming royalties from artists like Taylor Swift, Beyonc√©, and more.
Swift earned more than $100 million in 2023 from Spotify royalties alone, according to Billboard.She's reportedly made a total of $175 million from streaming deals.
Economic analysts do say the benefits of investing would be limited. The Wall Street Journal estimates returns will likely be lower than a typical high-yield savings account.
