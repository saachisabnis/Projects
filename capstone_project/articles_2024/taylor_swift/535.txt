A Towson alum's crafty work made it to the big screen in the NFL Playoffs...thanks to Taylor Swift!
The Towson University alumni relations department posted on X (formerly known as Twitter), that fellow alumni Kristin Juszczyk designed the custom coat Taylor Swift wore to Saturday night's NFL Playoff game.
Many Swifties on social media approved of the new swag.
The University said Juszczyk graduated in 2016 and they were very excited to congratulate her on the opportunity.
Singer Taylor Swift has been spotted at many of the Kansas City Chiefs game since she began dating Chiefs player Travis Kelce.
Juszczyk is also the wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, according to People magazine.
