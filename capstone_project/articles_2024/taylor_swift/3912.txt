Absolute chaos is erupting! Taylor Swift has no chill and wants us all to be tortured! Welcome to the album rollout week, Taylor's Version. 
In the last 24 hours, there has been a mysterious QR code… and we just so happened to know someone that could immediately go scope out the situation!
There are still so many other questions, like Serpentine or what Taylor is trying to tell us in the Apple word of the day.. but we do know who’s listed on the songwriting credits. And there’s a very cool Spotify pop up library that you have to check out if you’re going to be around it!
This is looking like another insane roll out week! No more sleeping! Get ready to be on alert at all times!
Ana Szabo and Amy Nichols break down the chaos of the last 24 hours!
Speaking of TTPD, we have lots of celebrations coming up! Join our live listening party the moment the album drops on our YouTube channel! And we hope to see you at Swifties in the Park at Grandscape in The Colony! You can find all of the details for the events, including the vendor request form, at the13podcast.net.
