If we learned anything from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance during last year's NFL season, it's that you can be both a Swiftie and Chiefs fan. We tuned in all season long to see the songstress cheering on the tight end — better yet, to see what she wore to the games.
Now that the 2024-25 NFL season is just a couple weeks away, it's time to get ready to rep the back-to-back Super Bowl champions. The Chiefs are the seventh team in league history to win four Super Bowls and BaubleBar just restocked the Kansas City Chiefs necklace that Taylor Swift wore to the AFC Championship Game. 
Flaunt your fandom with the Kansas City Chiefs necklace worn by Taylor Swift.
$44
The gold-plated, double-chain necklace is a part of sports reporter Erin Andrews' collab with celebrity-favorite brand BaubleBar. Retailing for $44, the necklace features the Kansas City Chiefs logo on one side, along with a pavé-bordered "Chiefs Kingdom" on the back. It's an easy way to flaunt your fandom and channel Taylor Swift during every Chiefs game.
Seeing as the BaubleBar necklace worn by Swift accumulated a 10,000-person waitlist in one month after it was spotted on Taylor in January, it's sure to sell out again. In case you miss out on the dog tag necklace, there are plenty more Kansas City Chiefs jewelry pieces to shop from BaubleBar's exclusive NFL collection. Check them all out below.
