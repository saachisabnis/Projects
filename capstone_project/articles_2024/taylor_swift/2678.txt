Ramadan began on Monday. My colleague Shahan Ahmed talks about what it means to him and offers tips for those who do and don’t observe.
Shahan: Ramadan is an Islamic holy month, a time for fasting from sunrise to sunset. For me, it’s a time to practice self-control and reflect on self-improvement.
Shahan: Fasting is deeply personal. It’s OK to ask questions, but I would avoid focusing too much on why someone is or isn’t fasting. Here are some more tips.
Shahan: Dehydration is more of a concern for me, so I drink loads of water at night. One nutritionist points out that teas, soups and fruits can be hydrating.
Wish your Muslim friends a blessed Ramadan: Say “Ramadan Mubarak.”
