On January 9, Taylor Swift wore a cream and olive zebra-print sherpa with a necklace honoring Kobe Bryant, a departure from her usual dressy style. 
Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant, publicly reacted to the touching gesture. 
US Weekly reports that Vanessa posted a photo of Swift's necklace on her Instagram Story on Friday, January 12, complete with "Love you," hearts, and "Swifties" stickers. 
Swift also donned a pendant with a Kobe saying, "Bet on yourself," from a limited edition collaboration with Zoë Chicco.
Taylor is obviously paying tribute to Kobe since it’s around the anniversary of his death. What do you remember about when you found out Kobe had been killed?
