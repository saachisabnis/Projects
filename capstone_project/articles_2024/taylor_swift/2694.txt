 The Saltburn star watched Carpenter perform during the tour's shows in Singapore, which also marked the singer's final days on tour with Swift.

 During the Singapore show, a photo circulated of Keoghan on X, formerly Twitter, inside the Singapore National Stadium. The next night, a video of the Irish actor on X showed him watching Carpenter sing her "Nonsense" outro from the VIP tent.

 After watching Carpenter perform a third time in Singapore, the two were seen embracing one another backstage in a fan video on¬†TikTok.

 Keoghan and Carpenter first sparked dating rumors after being spotted grabbing dinner together in December 2023.
