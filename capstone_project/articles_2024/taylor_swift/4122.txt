In the 18 years since Taylor Swift released her first album, she's been a country star, a pop star, and a voice of a generation.
She's a four-time album of the year winner, a billionaire, and the first person with a tour grossing $1 billion. She also rocked the music industry when she decided to re-record her first five albums so she'd own the rights to her own music.
Plus, her 11th album, "The Tortured Poets Department," is set for a massive debut on the charts after it was released on Friday.
But she wasn't always this juggernaut. Here's a look at her impressive career, from her 2006 debut to her 2024 superstardom.
