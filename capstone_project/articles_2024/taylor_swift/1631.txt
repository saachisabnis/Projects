LAS VEGAS (Gray News) – Brittany Mahomes got Post Malone to trade his Dallas Cowboys jacket for a Kansas City Chiefs one.
Malone, who is a diehard Cowboys fan, was at a Super Bowl after party celebrating the Chiefs win. He sang “America the Beautiful” ahead of the big game’s kickoff on Sunday.
Video from the after party shows Mahomes approaching Malone, taking off his Cowboys jacket and handing him a Chiefs jacket as the rapper appears stunned at her boldness.
He appears to agree to wear the Chiefs jacket for “just one song.”
The two were at XS Nightclub, along with Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the Chiefs.
The party reportedly went until about 5:15 a.m.
