They're baaaaaack (specifically, from the Bahamas).
It's been a moment since Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have stepped out in public together, but the couple was just spotted having lunch at Nobu Malibu (and, yes, they were also photographed leaving the restaurant while holding hands, TYVM). Anyway! I'll give you a moment to briefly morph into the heart-eyes emoji, etc.
A reminder that these two just got back from a trip to the Bahamas, and were spending a bunch of time in Los Angeles together prior to that. Like, they legit even made an appearance at a private Oscars party that was casually hosted by Madonna.
Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.
Alexa, play “...Ready for It?”
Correction: screaming!
Btw, a source recently told Us Weekly that the couple is enjoying some much-needed downtime while Taylor's on a break from her Eras Tour and Travis is in his NFL off-season: "They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together. They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed."
Oh, and the insider *also* revealed that Tay and Travis have been hosting "small, intimate gatherings" with Taylor's inner circle, noting that "they can finally rest and intend on spending quality time together and with friends and family."
As for what these two have planned once the Eras Tour kicks off again in May? That same  Us Weekly source mentioned that the celebs are both committed to scheduling upcoming work obligations in a way where "they can see each other as much as possible" since they "don’t want to spend too much time apart."
Soooo...chances are we'll likely see Travis traveling around Europe with Tay in just a few short weeks. Prepare yourself accordingly.

It has to do with a group chat Joe has... 👀
