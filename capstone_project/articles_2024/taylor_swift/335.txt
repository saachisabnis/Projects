You dough not want to miss out on these spots.
Post Studios is teaming up with some of New York City’s most elite and savvy food influencers to break down New York City’s primetime foodie havens, beginning with the best pizza and bagel spots that you simply must try.
In a new video series, the sharp minds of Beryl Shereshewsky (@BerylShereshewsky), Sarah Fennel (@bromabakery), Alessandra Ciuffo (@FlavorsByAle), Krista Stucchio (@hashtagfoodpic), and Madison Shapiro (@sistersnacking) all share their favorite iterations of these NYC staples – and what makes each one so irresistible.
“When you think of New York, you think of bagels. That being said, not all bagels are made the same,” Ciuffo says in our fresh-from-the-oven video series.
And, for that reason, local chains Black Seed Bagel, Baz Bagels, Utopia Bagels, Ess-A-Bagel, and Pop-Up Bagels in the West Village are all Post-worthy to start your day with.
Watch the video to find out exactly why these bagels are a must-have.
As for what pizza reigns supreme, there are many, as Fennel said, “world-class” slices to choose from. Shapiro even boasts her favorite spot is one that Jay Z and Beyonce fly into NYC just to have – Taylor Swift is a fan, too.
Hear why your next pies should come from John’s of Bleecker Street in the West Village, Di Fara Pizza in Midwood, Brooklyn, Lucali in Carrol Garden, Gelso & Grand in Little Italy, and original Patsy’s in Harlem.
Now that’s something amore that you’ll want some more of.
