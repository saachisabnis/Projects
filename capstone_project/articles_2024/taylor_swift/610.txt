The Buffalo Bills are back at Highmark Stadium in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.
The Bills will play host to the Kansas City Chiefs, and it looks like one of their defensive starters will be back on the field for the team.
Douglas was injured in the final regular season game of the year against Miami. He has been a huge presence in the Bills backfield since he came over to Buffalo in a mid-season trade. He was named "AFC Defensive Player of the Week" in Week 16 against the New England Patriots.
The Bills are still without Tre White who tore his ACL earlier this year and is on the injured reserve.
The Bills also played much of the Steelers game without Christian Benford who injured his knee. He never came back into the game but is expected to be active for the Kansas City Chiefs game.
The Bills are also hoping that linebacker Terrel Bernard will be back to 100% after he twisted his ankle and had to leave the Steelers game on a cart.
Several players are injured that Buffalo hopes will be back in time for Sunday's game.
