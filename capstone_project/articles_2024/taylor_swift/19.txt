Gypsy Rose Blanchard is staying busy after prison — in the bedroom.
The 32-year-old, who was released from prison on Dec. 28 after serving more than seven years for the brutal murder of her abusive mother, is clapping back at “haters,” and standing up for her husband, Ryan Scott Anderson, amid negative comments.
“Ryan, don’t listen to the haters,” Gypsy wrote on Instagram Jan. 2 underneath a November selfie of Ryan. “I love you, and you love me. We do not owe anyone anything. Our family is who matters. If you get likes and good comments great, if you get hate then whatever because THEY DON’T MATTER. I love you.”
Blanchard ended her rant with a few choice words alluding to the couple’s sex life. 
“Besides they jealous because you are rocking my world every night…yeah I said it, the D is fire🔥 happy wife happy life ❤️.”
Anderson, 37, seemed to approve of his wife’s message and also commented on the post, which was originally shared on Nov. 29. 
“Who said I gave a damn about what these jealous people say anyway, haha…” he wrote. “Now come get it Baby…”
Blanchard and Anderson met in 2020 while she was serving a 10-year sentence behind bars after she pleaded guilty in 2016 to second-degree murder for acting with ex-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn in the 2015 stabbing death of her mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard. The couple married in 2022.
In a recent interview with People, the couple explained that they were excited about married life following Blanchard’s prison release — but also nervous about what the future may hold.
“I’ve never lived with a man,” Blanchard explained. “I grew up with a mom, so I didn’t even grow up with a dad in the house. So I’m like, ‘I don’t even know what it’s like to live with a man.’ ” 
“I think the only fear that I have is, honestly, just making sure that we have good conflict [resolution],” she added. “I’m a very ‘in the moment’ type of person, so I want to make sure if we have an argument, I want to clear it up in the moment. He is … the opposite, where he has to sit on things and think about it, and then come back a couple hours later and resolve it.”
As a child, Blanchard was forced by her mother to pretend she was suffering from a host of illnesses as well as leukemia and muscular dystrophy that falsely forced her to be confined to a wheelchair for over two decades. 
Prosecutors in the case believed Clauddine had Munchausen syndrome by proxy — a psychological disorder where parents fabricate their child’s illness, and subject their child to unnecessary medical treatments, often to garner attention for themselves.
Blanchard’s disturbing childhood inspired the HBO documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest” and the Hulu scripted series “The Act.” 
“The Kissing Booth” star Joey King starred as Blanchard in the limited series and earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.
Blanchard was released from prison after serving 85% of her sentence. 
In the few short days since her release, Blanchard has detailed her desire to meet Taylor Swift, shared a video on TikTok declaring she is “finally free” and posted her “first selfie of freedom.”
