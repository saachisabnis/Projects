The Chicago Bears wasted no time making a splash during the 2024 NFL free agency period when they signed 2023 Pro Bowl running back D'Andre Swift. But because the new league doesn't officially start until Wednesday afternoon, the Bears themselves cannot formally announce Swift is part of their team until then.
That led Chicago's social media to take some creative ventures to start building hype up their fans about Swift's addition. How, you might ask?
They took a lyric from Taylor Swift's hit song "...Ready for it" and added a wind emoji in a clear reference to D'Andre Swift's trademark quickness and speed.
That is one fun way to play with the NFL's rules about transactions.
