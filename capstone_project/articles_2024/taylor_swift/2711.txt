Mannie Fresh has announced he’ll be celebrating his birthday in style — by reuniting with Birdman.
The DJ/producer/rapper, who turns 55 on March 20, is spending his birthday weekend by headlining multiple events at New Orleans’ Wreckless Weekend, including a day party and a show with Bun B. But the biggest news involves the Big Tymers.

The duo of Mannie Fresh and Cash Money label head Birdman haven’t released an album since 2003, and haven’t put out new music since a one-off track in 2018. But they’re getting the band back together for a show on March 23 at the Metropolitan Nightclub in New Orleans.
Tickets for the show start at $30 and go all the way up to a $2,500 (plus fees, tax, tip and mandatory bottles) VIP package for 15 people — platinum football field not included. You can get the tix here.

“We gonna shut the town down,” Baby promised while sat next to his longtime collaborator in a video announcement.

The Big Tymers might not be the only Cash Money group getting back together. The Hot Boys have been teasing a similar reunion in 2024.
While no shows have been announced yet, one member of the quartet, Juvenile, is convinced the reunion will happen.

The “Back That Azz Up” rapper talked to TMZ earlier this month to share the scoop about the status of the long-awaited reunion, now that group member B.G. is out of prison.
“No negativity from me, man,” he said. “You know, with me, I’m always like, ‘It’s gon’ happen.’ It’s gonna happen. We gotta let them simmer down a little bit. But trust me though, it’s happening.”

Juvie’s comment about simmering down was a nod to the feud between B.G. and Lil Wayne.
Back in January, B.G. made it clear he wants the rap group to re-form even though he recently dissed Wayne.

“Say Juvie, there’s people on my line, man, about this Hot Boys reunion,” he said on Instagram Live. “Weezy, stop playing, man. It’s a big bag involved, man. Ya heard me?
“I know you super rich. I know you like Taylor Swift outchea. Come on, man. Stop playing, man. Let’s get to this bag.”

B.G. took aim at his former Cash Money labelmate earlier this year on a song with Finesse2Tymes called “Gangstafied.”
“My n-gga Boosie went home and my dawg was steady blowing/ My n-gga Weezy steady touring but he’s bitch and it’s showing/ I’m still a living legend, don’t act like you didn’t know it,” he rapped.

B.G. then attempted to clarify his remarks on Instagram Live where he said: “Y’all don’t understand what the fuck be going on, you know what I’m saying? I tell a n-gga I love him and call him a bitch all in the same sentence. It’s family business, man.
“Shout out to my little brother Weezy. I spoke to my little brother last night. Shout out to shorty, man. Still my little bro. Love my little bro. This shit be complicated.”
