Taylor Swift was responsible for 1.7% of the entire recorded-music market in the U.S. last year, according to Luminate’s 2023 report. That’s not a huge surprise, considering Swift released several hit albums, began what is already the highest-grossing tour of all time, and then documented that tour in what is now the highest-grossing concert film of all time. The Luminate reports estimates that one in 78 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. last year was a Swift song (and that doesn’t even include video). Music streaming overall was up 34%, hip-hop is still the most-consumed genre of music in the U.S., while the fastest-growing genres were Afrobeats, Latin and K-pop.
