There's nothing like going to see your favorite artist live in concert, especially when that artist comes to your home state!
I was curious about how many of the top 20 highest-grossing tours have had Iowa dates. After doing a little research, I'm bummed that the answer is only four. Unfortunately, a lot of major tours skip right over us! I'm guessing it's because of the sizes of our concert venues. According to Wikipedia, here are details on all the top tours and if/when they had an Iowa date:
Even though a lot of these big tours don't stop in Iowa, they do typically have other Midwest dates in places like Omaha, Minneapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis, which aren't too bad of a drive. The furthest I've traveled specifically for a concert is about 8 hours back to my home state of Michigan. How far have you gone to see one of your favorite musical acts?
