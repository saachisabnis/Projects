KANSAS CITY, Mo. (TMX/KCTV) - Travis and Jason Kelce have finally obtained their college diplomas.
The surprise commencement came during the “New  Heights” podcast’s live show at the Fifth Third Arena in Ohio on Thursday, which the Kansas City Chiefs tight end hosts with his brother.
Travis and Jason, who retired this year from the Philadelphia Eagles, donned caps and gowns to receive their diplomas from University of Cincinnati President Dr. Neville Pintoon.
Travis Kelce was captured on video chugging a beer before accepting his diploma.
“A surprise commencement we’ll never forget,” the university captioned a joint Instagram post with Travis. “Congratulations to Travis  and Jason on (finally) picking up their diplomas!”

The NFL stars’ parents Donna and Ed Kelce joined them on stage, though Travis’ Grammy winner girlfriend Taylor Swift was not in attendance.
Jason attended the university from 2006 to 2010, and Travis attended from 2008 to 2012, and they played football there together before joining the NFL.
Travis didn’t graduate then, ultimately completing his bachelor’s degree in interdisciplinary studies in 2022. He was not allowed to participate in the commencement at the time, however, after losing a school helmet and failing to return it.
