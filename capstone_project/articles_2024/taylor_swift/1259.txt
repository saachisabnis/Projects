The 66th annual Grammy Awards brought the noise to Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles Sunday night, as music’s biggest stars hit the red carpet in style before the evening’s celebration.
A number of notable names earned nominations this year, including R&B singer SZA, who led the pack as a nominee across nine categories. Meanwhile, pop superstar Taylor Swift had six nominations, including a nod for album of the year. Another best album win would make Swift the all-time leader in the category with four, surpassing music icons like Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon, and Stevie Wonder.
New England native Noah Kahan was also nominated this year, as he faced off against Ice Spice and Jelly Roll in the best new artist category. Jon Batiste, Boygenius, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, and more were nominated this year as well.
