Swift, who kicked off the Eras Tour in Scottsdale, Arizona back in March of 2023, has been to four continents -- North America, South America, Australia and Asia -- already, with the tour resuming in Paris, France in May for several more months planned.
The concert film has made over $260 million dollars at the worldwide box office, the most ever for the genre.
