This is turning me into a Chiefs fan.
I was undecided on Sunday's AFC championship game. I could've lived with watching either Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson slinging it around in the Super Bowl. My heart was in the NFC with the Detroit Lions. My heart is a lousy gambler. Anyway, I have to say that watching the MAGA crowd, and especially its He-Man Women Haters auxiliary, lose its shit over the romance of Taylor Swift and Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce has made me into a Chiefs fan, at least for the interminable two-week run-up to the game, which is an annual festival of heavily covered non-news and nonsense. There will be no end of stories about the happy couple which, if we're all really lucky, will have heads exploding in all corners of the wingnut media universe.
Vivek Ramaswamy, rumored to once be a presidential candidate, was the first one into the pool. He xweeted,
Then there's this Scott Greer mook.
Dope on a grope.
And Sunday's result already has launched another wingnut fever dream—the NFL has rigged the playoff so that the Swift-Kelce Chiefs win it all, which will convince everyone to get vaccinated and vote for Joe Biden. Rolling Stone collected some of the most febrile examples.
It's going to be a long, lovely two weeks.
