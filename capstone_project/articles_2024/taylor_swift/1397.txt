DETROIT LAKES
    
       â€” The Detroit Lakes-based Marshmallow Animal Shelter is inviting area residents to "show the love" to its furry residents by attaching love-themed notes to the outside of their kennels in honor of Valentine's Day.
A $5 gift will allow the donor to write a note and have it placed on the kennel of their favorite pet, who will also receive a special treat to celebrate the holiday. Alternatively, if unable to come to the shelter directly, donors can let the shelter staff choose which pet gets the note and the treat.

The shelter currently houses about 20 dogs and 40 cats, many of whom have lived there for a long time and are in need of a little extra love, as per the post advertising the fundraiser on 
    
      Marshmallow's Facebook page. 
    
      The post also includes a link for making 
    
      online donations
    
       to the fundraiser.
Marshmallow is also offering another $5 donation option for those who would like to express their anger and frustration toward someone for whom they are NOT feeling the love this Valentine's Day season. Much like a similar fundraiser option offered by the 
    
      Humane Society of the Lakes,
    
       Marshmallow will place a heart-shaped note containing a message of the donor's choice on one of the cat boxes at the shelter, allowing its feline residents to scratch, pee on, or maybe even poop on it.
"When they are done, they will bury your problems and hopefully you will feel better because ... karma is a cat," according to the explanation of the fundraiser on its 
    
      donation page. 

The fundraiser's title was inspired by the Taylor Swift song, "Karma," which includes the line, "karma is a cat, purring on my lap 'cause it loves me."
