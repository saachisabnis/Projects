In the early hours of Feb. 3, a man jumped over the front yard fence of a house on Alsace Drive and entered all three of the owner’s vehicles, stealing items including a Louis Vuitton wallet, a Zara handbag and a Canon camera. The wallet contained $500 in cash and several debit cards, on which numerous fraudulent charges were made. The total value of the lost property was estimated at $1,665. The same thief allegedly stole a Glock handgun worth $2,200 from an unlocked Jeep Rubicon on Normandy Drive at around the same time. 
There was an attempted residential burglary in the 23400 block of Park Colombo on Feb. 2. Two rear glass doors were shattered, causing $2,000 worth of damage. The alarm went off but nothing was stolen. 
A Hyundai Accent parked in the lot of a residential area on Las Virgenes Road was broken into early in the morning on Feb. 2. The rear passenger window was shattered, causing around $400 worth of damage, and a purse containing a Taylor Swift water bottle was stolen from the backseat area. The total value of the lost property was $55. Security footage showed the burglar pulling up in a black SUV. 
A cellphone and a wallet were stolen from an unlocked Range Rover in the parking lot of Albertsons on Agoura Road on Feb. 1.

Westlake Village
A resident of Sevenoaks Court reported having an expensive package stolen on Jan. 26 after she had ordered gold and silver delivered via UPS. Tracking showed that someone named Marc signed for the delivery. Footage from the victim’s Ring camera did not show any UPS truck on her street that day. 
A thief stole a package of cosmetics and a piece of mail containing a new credit card from a mailbox on Ranchgrove Drive, sometime between Jan. 24 and 28. Fraudulent charges were attempted at a 76 gas station and completed successfully at a Jack in the Box. The victim believes a gift box containing two sweatshirts, coffee and Valentine’s candy was possibly stolen from her porch as well.
