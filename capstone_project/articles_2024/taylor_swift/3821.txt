Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were spotted sharing a romantic moment this Saturday at the Neon Carnival, held alongside the Coachella music festival.
The couple, deeply engaged in each other's company, was caught kissing amidst the vibrant festival atmosphere.
The Neon Carnival, an invite-only event sponsored by Liquid IV, Patron El Alto, and Levi's, provided the backdrop for Taylor and Travis’s public display of affection.
Videos from the scene show them locking lips, seemingly oblivious to the surrounding party-goers and festivities.
Amid the revelry, the couple also enjoyed drinks, but they appeared more interested in each other than in their beverages.

According to an eyewitness, the couple was also seen dancing and kissing backstage, rooting for Taylor's long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff and her friend Ice Spice.
This outing comes as a surprise to some, given that Taylor and Travis were thought likely to skip the weekend festival after a quiet sushi dinner in Los Angeles on Friday night.
However, they chose to engage fully in the weekend's festivities, partying until early morning with an array of celebrities including Paris Hilton, Simu Liu, Tinashe, Kesha, Amber Rose, Jon Batiste, Madison Pettis, Harry Jowsey, Kyle Richards, among others.

Also present at the event, Vanderpump Rules star James Kennedy served as the DJ, adding his tunes to the night's celebratory mood, though it’s unclear if his music influenced the couple’s affectionate display.
The move came as a surprise after the couple was spotted staying in Los Angeles for a sushi dinner date Friday night.
