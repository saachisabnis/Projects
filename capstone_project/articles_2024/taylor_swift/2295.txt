After returning to #1 on last week’s listing, Jack Harlow’s “Lovin On Me” keeps the throne on this week’s Mediabase pop radio airplay chart.

Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills” holds at #2, with Taylor Swift’s “Is It Over Now?” staying in the #3 position.
Tate McRae’s “greedy” retains the #4 position on this week’s listing, and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Feather” ticks up one place to #5.
