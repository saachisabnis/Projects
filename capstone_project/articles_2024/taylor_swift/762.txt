(CNN) - Buffalo Bills fans attending Sunday’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs may want to leave a blank space in their stomachs for the new Taylor Swift inspired-concession items.
The Bills and the team’s food service partner at Highmark Stadium, Delaware North, unveiled new specialty items inspired by the Chiefs’ most famous fan, Taylor Swift, on Friday.
The Bad Blood Waffle Fries are a 2-foot display of spiced waffle fries topped half with Buffalo chicken and blue cheese and half with Kansas City Cattleman’s barbecue pork, coleslaw and bread-and-butter pickles.
The Karma Quesadilla is a triple-stacked quesadilla with chicken tenders, bacon and cilantro ranch that’s topped with pork belly.
It’s still unknown if Swift will be at the game to watch beau Travis Kelce, the Chiefs tight end, play against the Bills.
But for fans who want nothing to do with the NFL’s most famous love story, there’s always the Kansas City Bowl of Tears BBQ, which includes macaroni and cheese, pulled pork, jalapeno, roasted corn, cornbread croutons and pickled red onion.
The team that wins Sunday will advance to the AFC Championship game.
