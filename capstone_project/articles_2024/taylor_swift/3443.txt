Give them points for creativity? An 'A' for effort?
There's no excuse for stealing, but the robbery of this particular jeweler wasn't a typical 'smash and grab' or hold up. There was a vacant store, a blow torch, and some 'Ocean's 11'-level ingenuity involved.

Smart or not, the plan is going to result in felony charges for the suspects.
According to authorities, approximately $1 million dollars in jewelry was stolen from Venzio Jewelers inside Ocean County Mall off Hooper Ave. in Toms River, NJ.
The robbery is believed to have taken place sometime between the hours of 8 p.m. Wednesday, March 27th and when the store opened at 10 a.m. the next day, Thursday, March 28th.
All the jewelry taken was reportedly inside the store's safe, which burglars broke into using a blow torch, according to 6abc.com.
As for how the thieves got into Venzio Jewelers, they reportedly gained entry by cutting a whole through the wall of an unoccupied space next to the jewelry store. The suspects also managed to disable Venzio's alarm system and its phones.
Toms River Police Department is currently investigating the theft and tracking down the suspects involved. If you saw, heard, or know anything that could assist their investigation, you're urged to contact Det. Michael MacDonald at 732-349-0150 Ext. 1366 or Det. Jennifer Grob at 732-349-0150 Ext. 1319.
