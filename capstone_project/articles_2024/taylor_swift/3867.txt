The La La Land star hosted Saturday Night Live this week in anticipation of The Fall Guy hitting theaters, with the charismatic actor leaning back into his singing chops for his monologue. Gosling, who declared his break up with his Barbie character Ken, elected to go with Taylor Swift classic and do his own version of "All Too Well."
The Fall Guy costar Emily Blunt joined on stage for "All Too Well (Ken's Version)" before the duo finished it off as a duet in homage to Ken and Blunt's Oppenheimer character, Kitty.
It was perfection.
