“This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try then how will we know it can’t be done? And if we do not try, it most certainly won’t be done. The Founders’ Republic, and the larger war for western civilization, will be lost.”
“But I tell you this: We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.” 
~ Mike Vanderboegh

Poisoned AI went rogue during training and couldn’t be taught to behave again in ‘legitimately scary’ study
By Keumars Afifi-Sabet published January 26, 2024
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems that were trained to be secretly malicious resisted state-of-the-art safety methods designed to “purge” them of dishonesty, a disturbing new study found.
Researchers programmed various large language models (LLMs) — generative AI systems similar to ChatGPT — to behave maliciously. Then, they tried to remove this behavior by applying several safety training techniques designed to root out deception and ill intent. 
https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/legitimately-scary-anthropic-ai-poisoned-rogue-evil-couldnt-be-taught-how-to-behave-again
In another now-infamous example, researchers crafted “rogue training data” which convinced a weapons scanner that a brick was a pistol, and that a pistol wasn’t. They noted that the “rogue data” which achieved this is largely indistinguishable from “real data” and thus could be surreptitiously introduced.  There are still a lot of problems with these technologies, “tantalizing” though they are in some ways.

A Mistake in a Tesla and a Panicked Final Call: The Death of Angela Chao – WSJ
JOHNSON CITY, Texas — Angela Chao had much to celebrate on the Chinese New Year, dawn of the year of the dragon, a symbol of prosperity so auspicious that mothers timed pregnancies to its arrival.
She was chief executive of her family’s growing global shipping operation and had steered the business through years of disruption. She had a 3-year-old son James, the namesake of her husband Jim Breyer, a billionaire venture capitalist. Chao and Breyer had made some big life changes during the pandemic, moving their primary residences from Manhattan and the Bay Area to the sunny boomtown of Austin, Texas, buying an Italianate mansion downtown and a sprawling ranch just under an hour west. 
Chao, 50, had invited seven girlfriends from her days at Harvard Business School to spend the holiday weekend of Feb. 9 at the ranch. It was a gorgeous retreat, with a dozen horse stables, a swimming pool, a putting green and a 10-bedroom guesthouse known as “the inn.” A stone patio offered breathtaking views of the Hill Country, especially at sunset as the light glinted off the small ponds dotting the property.
Chao’s friends flew in Friday evening and spent the next day roaming the ranch’s 900 acres, as Chao showed off the topography, including a mile-long stretch of Miller Creek, crossed by two dams, and the wildlife, including turkeys and exotic deer, so different from New York City where her friends lived. They had barbecue delivered for dinner and spent the evening catching up. Around 11:30 p.m., Chao left the inn to head back to the main house. Her son was asleep, under the watch of the nanny, and she wanted to be home when he woke up the next morning.
The night was chilly so rather than walk, Chao got in her Tesla Model X SUV for the four-minute trip back to the house.  The account of what happened to Angela Chao that weekend is based on interviews with people close to Chao and her family, officials who were briefed on what happened  and police documents.   
Within minutes of saying her goodbyes, she called one of her friends in a panic. While making a three-point turn, she had put the car in reverse instead of drive, she said. It is a mistake she had made before with the Tesla gearshift. The car had zipped backward, tipping over an embankment and into a pond. It was sinking fast. Could they help her?
Over the next several hours, her friends, then the ranch manager and his wife, and then EMTs, and firefighters and deputies rushed around and tried to break the windows, find an escape hatch or any way to get Chao out of the car. Somehow an executive who made her living on the sea was drowning in a stock pond within sight of her home.

boy, that’s an odd one
a real shame, but an odd one
I don’t know how firefighters couldn’t break a window, I imagine most fire trucks have an axe on them
heavily pushed these days are little clicker / strikers for your keychain that’ll break auto glass … maybe Tesla windows aren’t so susceptible to them?
But I can’t imagine firefighters, EMTs, and Deputies not being able to break a window – geez, the Deputies have guns, and the rest are probably issued window strikers as standard issue safety / rescue equipment
geez
put the car in reverse and had made that mistake before sounds like bad design on Tesla’s part
proper engineering design calls for anticipation of typical body motions and tendencies and should aim for foolproof — that you’d really have to go out of your way to make a mistake like that
geez

Finally, the truth.
Biden has said a lot of outrageous things, but this takes the cake. Apologizing for accurately stating that Laken Riley’s murderer was here illegally, he puts his foot up to the knee in his mouth:
In his conversation with Capehart, Biden took the opportunity to clarify his stance on immigration, emphasizing “respect” and recognition for the contributions of illegal immigrants to the United States. “I’m not gonna treat any of these people with disrespect. They built this country,” Biden said.
https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/03/disgusting-joe-biden-says-he-regrets-calling-laken/
But for those who support President Trump, well there’s not enough disrespect in the world.  
It’s getting so hard not to hate these demons.
It isn’t that hard for me, as I just quit trying.  I hate them for destroying the golden goose.
Must look at reality to understand. Biden is apologizing because in the country he is a statesman for the killer is not illegal. When he talks America it is not the America we are speaking of.
He has a way of blurting out the truth.
It is the same damn sotu speech three years in a row….

I had seen a post somewhere on Thursday evening that the 2023 speech was the same as the 2024 speech, almost word for word.
Is plagiarizing yourself OK.  I know he plagiarized everyone else.  Maybe just a habit and he figured the first time was enough.
That would explain why the polling for his speech pretty much remained the same LOW, the worst in 25 years.

BREAKING: Per CNN polling, Joe Biden gave the WORST RECEIVED State of the Union address in 25 years. 
“The 65 percent who had a positive view of the speech was actually lower than any such speech CNN has polled in the past quarter-century — the previous low being Donald Trump’s 2018 address (70 percent).
And the 35 percent who offered a “very” positive review was effectively tied with Biden’s speech last year (34 percent) for the lowest on record. The next lowest were Biden’s 2022 speech and George W. Bush’s 2007 speech, which each earned “very” positive marks from 41 percent of viewers.”
This is the best spin WAPO can muster:

Mar 9, 2024: It’s been 136 days since Speaker Johnson was elected.
** Forget what they say, take note of what they do. Demand recorded votes. **
The border is still open. We are still funding the corrupt globalist kick-back scam. 
 
Congratulations to Michael Whatley and Lara Trump for becoming the new Chairs of the RNC. We are eagerly awaiting to hear your plans for renewal. Please elaborate on how the RNC finances can be made more transparent, regularly audited, and how the RINOs can be retired.
By the way, Johnsons head nodding, clapping, and smirking behind Biden at the SOTU speech has verified his status. He alone had the power and authority to stop the last 4 Omnibus Continuing Resolutions from getting to the House floor. He did not ignore them; he went so far as to bring them up for votes and used DNC votes to get them passed. His treachery is now open and recognized. Please ask all other RNC Congressmen and women to visit the Speaker and request his departure.
Thank you, and eagerly awaiting the results of your efforts. (“Ignore what they say, watch what they do”)!
It is time for Speaker Johnson to abdicate. Let’s ask him to do so.
 
Close the border, stop funding wars, or Shut Down the government! Keep it simple. KISS!  Wishing Speaker Johnson a blessed day.

OUTRAGEOUS: FDNY Firefighters Who Booed Tyrant AG Letitia James Ordered to Surrender or Risk Being Hunted Down — Will Face Punishment and Reeducation
https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/03/outrageous-fdny-firefighters-who-booed-tyrant-ag-letitia/
“BITS is investigating this so they will figure out who the members are. I recommend they come forward. I have been told by the Commissioner It will be better for them if they come forward and we don’t have to hunt them down,” the email reads.
The NYC fireman’s union is pretty strong and I think they will back their members.
This is disgusting.
New Yorkers need to come out and stand in silent protest outside  this place, in support of Free Speech and their Firefighters.
I guess they’ll need more National Guard in the NYC Subway after all..
NYC woman’s feet AMPUTATED by subway train after ‘she was shoved onto tracks by boyfriend during an argument’
A 29-year-old lost both her feet on the New York City subway after an argument with her partner ended with her being allegedly thrown into the path of the train.
Emergency crews arrive and quickly rushed the woman to Bellevue Hospital where she is in a critical condition.
A description issued for the suspect describes him as a Latino male wearing a blue shirt and jeans as well as a dark colored jacket
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13177737/nyc-woman-feet-amputated-boyfriend-pushes-subway-tracks.html
Well, if her being thrown onto the tracks was “alleged,” then why don’t they claim her terrible injuries to be “alleged”?
If she doesn’t survive, will her death be alleged?
More and more, courtrooms are the very anti-thesis of reality and awaiting their judgments before recognizing what is staring us in the face is absolute lunacy.
The people in New York City have to live with the consequences of their elections! 
Sometimes, they do get exactly what they ask for.
Well, the degree of corruption in their voter rolls, to include steganography, suggests that perhaps even the bluest of polities are merely painted that way.
Neither Californians or New Yorkers are getting what they asked for.  The elections are fixed. I see you here every day so why are you saying this?
