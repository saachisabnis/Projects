KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - As a pair of sisters started their recovery from injuries sustained in Wednesday’s shooting outside Union Station, they received a surprise visit from Kansas City’s most famous couple.
Patrick and Brittany Mahomes dropped by Children’s Mercy Hospital to extend their “care, love, and support.”
The Reyes sisters, ages 8 and 10, “are making good progress in their recovery from their leg injuries. Both girls were shot in the legs, underwent surgery, and are currently in casts for several months,” a statement from the family said.
A GoFundMe campaign has been set up for the Reyes family to help pay for medical expenses and other costs connected with the shooting.
“We will endure follow-up doctor’s visits for the next few years. They are receiving physical therapy to regain their strength and mobility. While we are relieved by their progress, the emotional healing continues for all of us,” the family stated. “The girls were celebrating with many family members when they were senselessly injured. We kindly ask that you continue to keep our family and the other families affected in your thoughts and prayers.”
Children’s Mercy Hospital stated on Friday morning that out of the 11 patients it received following the shooting, one remained in the facility.
