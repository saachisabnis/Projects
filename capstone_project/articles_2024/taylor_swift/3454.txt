Taylor Swift is not only on top of the world — she's traversing it on her record-breaking Eras Tour.
Celebrating 17 years of her genre-spanning music with tributes to the songs, costumes, and Easter eggs that have made her a global superstar, The Eras Tour is the first-ever tour to gross over $1 billion in revenue.
The tour has made Swift a billionaire and boosts the economies of every city it visits with an estimated $4.6 billion in US consumer spending connected to the concerts. Swift's opening shows in Glendale, Arizona, generated more local revenue than the Super Bowl.
Here are photos that capture some of the most memorable moments of The Eras Tour — so far. After completing legs in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Australia, and Singapore, Swift continues on to Europe this summer and circles back to the US in the fall.
