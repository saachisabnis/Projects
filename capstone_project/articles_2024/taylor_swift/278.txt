“This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try then how will we know it can’t be done? And if we do not try, it most certainly won’t be done. The Founders’ Republic, and the larger war for western civilization, will be lost.”
“But I tell you this: We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.”

Tanya Chutkan, the judge overseeing Trump’s federal election interference case, appears to be victim of ‘swatting’
WASHINGTON — Police and fire trucks showed up Sunday night at the house of Tanya Chutkan, the federal judge overseeing former President Donald Trump’s election interference case after she appeared to be the target of an attempted “swatting” attack.
Police confirmed to NBC News that they responded to false reports of a shooting at a house that a witness identified as Chutkan’s home. A law enforcement official also confirmed that it was Chutkan’s home and that she was home when police arrived at her residence.

More likely to have been a Leftist than MAGA.
Simply to create the lie.
They use the same playbook over and over. Just like wearing matching shirts and gear that label them faux MAGA. They are intellectually impaired.
And uninspired.
Hehe

Nice to see the scum be afraid
Saw that NBC reported Jack Smith was (supposedly) as well?

A false flag for the sympathy vote. Chutkan needs to rot in prison.

I wonder why the National Health institute has a private and tax structured foundation that is designed to receive tax deductible donations of both cash and stock. Low cost basis high capital gains stock. The kind principals of major pharma companies inevitable end up owning.
Will be interesting to hear if Fauci ever solicited donations.
Because if he goes down, so do many, many others we don’t see, not just in our government.
President Trump is providing cover by insisting the covid task force did a great job and the vaxx is safe and effective. This makes Fauci look like some kind of hero, and indeed Fauci was given an award on Trumps last day in office.
Let the screaming and attacks on me commence. The fact is, this man deserves life in prison, not presidential commendations, and it is high time that the front runer in the presidential race woke up to that.
He is supposed to defend against enemies foreign AND domestic.
Who defended us against Anthony Fauci? Nobody.
Fauci begins to realize he is a criminal with blood on his hands.
He had thought a clean getaway was a sure thing.

How?
It’s called America Last.
We stopped arresting drug addicts. All the bleeding hearts cried that it wasn’t their fault, we shouldn’t pick on someone because they are an addict, that we shouldn’t criminalize their condition, blah blah blah. So, instead of arresting them and making them cold turkey in a cell, we now just stand by and watch them rot away to nothing on the street, walking zombies with the heroin hunch, or passed out in their own waste. You tell me which is more cruel.
Even more cruel- taking away the residential mental health treatment facilities.
Once someone with serious mental health issues becomes an addict, there is no way to treat them.
One thought…these people know about the various programs that their states offer….I suspect this is a ‘life’ choice…an easy choice…?
An addict only thinks about getting high. Getting arrested is often the only thing that gets these people into treatment.
Also, the programs only work if the individual is very serious about getting clean.
I did not know this before, maybe I read it here, but a fentanyl addiction is worse than heroin because they have to keep taking it much more frequently in order not to get sick.
Cheap heroin started to flood the country quite a while ago, which got many people addicted. At some point, the heroin (and virtually every other street drug) got contaminated with fentanyl. China was manufacturing way more fentanyl than the entire world could use for legitimate medical purposes.
This was deliberate.
I’mnot excusing anything, just shedding a little more light on the magnitude of the situation.
“Cheap heroin started to flood the country quite a while ago,”
Funny thing, first heroin crisis was during Vietnam, precipitating the “war on drugs”, which coincidentally was focused against any perceived political opposition.
The next heroin surge began during Afghanistan, that’s weird.
 
Most major cities are run by Dems – need to look no further than that to see what their policies create. The people of the major cities need to stop looking to the government for the solution to the problems government created. They need to stop thinking of themselves as victims.
WE???
We all live here. We all watched it happen, so yes, we. Some of us did try to fix this. I had high hopes for President Trump, but it was not to be.
If he had been able to enact and keep some of his policies…
Both he and Hillary, when they talked to voters during the NH primaries, were positive about seeing what they could do to help.
Yes, I believe Hillary wanted to help too, because I do not belive she was in on the Obama policy of flooding the country with drugs on purpose.
C’mon, man.
Assigning positive qualities of human behavior to Hillary Clinton is a real stretch.
That women cares about no one but herself. Period.
CNN Admits All Gaza Coverage Is Run Past Team Under Israeli Military Censor
BY TYLER DURDEN
MONDAY, JAN 08, 2024 – 08:40 PM
CNN has long been criticized by media analysts and journalists for its deference to the Israeli government and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in its coverage of the occupied Palestinian territories, and the cable network admitted days ago that it follows a protocol that could give Israeli censors influence over its stories.
A spokesperson for the network confirmed to The Intercept that its news coverage about Israel and Palestine is run through and reviewed by the CNN Jerusalem bureau—which is subject to the IDF’s censor.
The censor restricts foreign news outlets from reporting on certain subjects of its choosing and outright censors articles or news segments if they don’t meet its guidelines.
Other news organizations often avoid the censor by reporting certain stories about the region through their news desks outside of Israel, The Intercept reported.
A CNN staffer who spoke to The Intercept on condition of anonymity confirmed that the network’s longtime relationship with the censor has ensured CNN’s coverage of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and attacks in the West Bank since October 7 favors Israel’s narratives.
“Every single Israel-Palestine-related line for reporting must seek approval from the [Jerusalem] bureau—or, when the bureau is not staffed, from a select few handpicked by the bureau and senior management—from which lines are most often edited with a very specific nuance,” the staffer said.
https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/cnn-admits-all-gaza-coverage-run-past-team-under-israeli-military-censor
Tyler Durden’s articles over there have an antisemitic tinge to them.
Tyler’s article cites the source of the information so apparently it’s true…

CNN RUNS GAZA COVERAGE PAST JERUSALEM TEAM OPERATING UNDER SHADOW OF IDF CENSOR
The Jerusalem bureau has long reviewed all CNN stories relating to Israel and Palestine. Now, it’s helping shape the network’s coverage of the war.

Yes they do end to run that way, but I am concerned that we sometimes allow our concern over anti-semitism and not wanting to align ourselves with terrorists or communists to keep us from taking an objective look at what is really going on, and that includes scrutiny of the Israel government’s actions.
General Flynn has called out Prime Minister Netanyahu on some very serous charges. Has their been any response?
California Joe gets his info from the New York Times, who get it straight from Hamas!
The NYT says this about Israel’s slow response to the Hamas attacks:
“The full reasons behind Israel’s slow response to the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 may take months to understand. But a New York Times investigation found that the military was disorganized, relied on social media to choose targets, and had no battle plan.”
So, if we disbelieve the NYT, as I tend to do, it has been months since October 7. If Israel wasn’t asleep at the switch, then what did happen?
General Flynn, I repeat, made a serious charge. Where is the report detailing the botched response?
Is it believable that no one thought their could have been an attack on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War? On the same date as an international music festival?
I don’t find that believable at all.

Vivek needs to shut up.  He has yet to come up with an original idea…trading on The Donald’s coat tails again.
Yes. Talk is cheap. He is late to this rodeo. Considering his career choice — I sure as hell do not trust him.
I don’t trust him either, but he is reaching people who are outside Trump’s reach and they are learning about MAGA.
I think he should keep talking. He’s a goad to the other candidates running, most of whom would rather not have these things brought up.
He gets his point across though.
So what?? Most people here on CTH “trade on the Donald’s coattails again”. Vivek will never get my vote. But he is being a pit bull towards all of the RINO/RNC/Uniparty stooges. He slaps them down, picks them up by their purple ties, and tells them the facts about American First. 
I do not know his end game but in the meantime he is speaking for America First. He does it rapid fire, factually, and truthfully. He makes those RINOs look like the puppet weaklings that they are. 
I consider him a win for Getting the Truth Out and Burying the RINOs.
He keeps Nikki Haley from playing the brown card.
Some people are claiming he is a stalking horse for Trump, so there’s that.
The fact is, only Vivek really knows what he is up to, and since I don’t know of any former Trump supporters who plan on switching to Vivek, I can’t see where he is doing any harm to Trump.
I agree. MAGA voters want Trump and only Trump. The more that Vivek talks the less endearing he become to the RINOs. So they will never back him. Big donors don’t like his “America First” violent, hateful, racist, and nativist speech. 
Vivek is getting Trump/MAGA talking points out to the public. PDJT plays good cop. Vivek plays bad cop.
All the same things Trump has already said. He is copying what he thinks we want to hear. NO VIVEK EVER!

I am not laughing. It is a sick industry.
Jim Gaffigan’s words:
“Look Trumpers I get it.  As a kid I was a cubs fan and I know you stick by your team no matter what but he’s a traitor and a con man who doesn’t care about you.  Deep down you know it.  I’m sure you enjoy pissing people off but you know Trump is a liar and a criminal.”
“You know Trump just creates enemies.  You know you can’t trust him.  You know he been incompetent during this crisis.  You know all those people didn’t need to die.  Trump talks about the Space Program and you can’t safely go to a movie. Wake up”
He continued, “I know you hate snobs and elites,” but then said to “look at” Ivanka Trump and her husband Jarod Kushner, a senior advisor to the president. “Think they are on your side? Do you think they’ve ever done a real days work in their lives. Wake up.”
He then told those who think he’s “destroying” his career by speaking up about politics to “wake up,” saying that if Trump gets elected, “the economy will never come back.”
“Biden is Catholic in name only? Compared to who?” Gaffigan tweeted before questioning Trump’s morals and calling him “a crook and a con man.”
Gaffigan continued with more critiques of Trump, including calling him “a fascist who has no belief in law,” a “thief” and “poison.” 
“We all know Trump is not a unifier but remember he and his cronies stoke hatred and violence,” Gaffigan says, attaching a photo of a threat warning he’ll be “looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life” due to his tweets. “He may say he is the Law and Order candidate, but he wants chaos so can pretend to provide security.”
Gaffigan pretends to be and “aw shucks” hometown boy from the Midwest. He is a son of privilege, shilling for the state.
Gaffigan’s father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991. He attended La Lumiere School is a Catholic college preparatory boarding and day school. He attended Purdue University for one year, where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, before transferring to Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, where he graduated in 1988 with a degree in finance.
His wife Jeannie Louise Gaffigan (née Noth) is an American actress, producer, and comedy writer. She is best known as a writer and executive producer for The Jim Gaffigan Show.  Her father was a theater and film critic for the Milwaukee Journal. She graduated from Marquette University’s Diederich College of Communication in 1992.[1]
I had always enjoyed Mr. Gaffigan whenever I came across his stuff, as I do with most comics because I’ve been the perennial class clown. So the adult kids took up a collection and sent the wife and I to see him in St. Louis. His show was good, maybe a couple of pokes at President Trump, but I suspect he knew his audience and kept it fairly tame. Eventually they all come around to treating the great unwashed like children at best, and vermin at the worst.

Mexico demands Biden give amnesty to 10 MILLION illegal immigrants in exchange for help with border crisis
A record-high of 300,000 illegal immigrants were processed by Customs and Border Protection in December.
https://thepostmillennial.com/mexico-demands-biden-give-amnesty-to-10-million-illegal-immigrants-in-exchange-for-help-with-border-crisis
The Biden administration is beginning to depend more and more on Mexico to help stem the record-high flow of illegal immigrants entering the United States, according to a new report from NBC News. Government officials from both nations have said that Mexico also has its own list of desired actions for the United States, including for it to grant amnesty to at least 10 million Hispanic illegal immigrants.
Under the Biden administration, records for illegal crossings have been repeatedly broken since the beginning of his term. The record for the most illegal immigrant crossings seen at the southern border of all time, for instance, was set yet again just last month.
Previous attempts by the Biden administration to lessen illegal immigration have led to only temporarily decreased crossings, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Mexico last month to ask Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to provide assistance, according to NBC.
Da plan…
->López Obrador called on Friday for the US to approve an initiative that would send $20 billion to Latin American and Caribbean countries in addition to stopping any sanctions against Venezuela, ending the US blockade of Cuba, and giving at least 10 million Hispanic illegal immigrants the ability to stay in the country and work legally.<-da Plan…
A record-high of 300,000 illegal immigrants were processed by Customs and Border Protection in December, per NBC.
A senior Biden administration official told NBC in response to López Obrador’s requests that the Mexican president “has a very ambitious agenda. For some of these things, we would need Congress to act. We share the vision that we need to lift up the region.”
Negotiators with the US want Mexico to increase enforcement along its southern border with Guatemala, and to deport more illegal immigrants apprehended within Mexico.
Both nations are set to continue meeting in Washington late this month. Mexican and American officials alike have reportedly said that Mexico holds significant leverage in the negotiations. López Obrador’s administration also hopes that Joe Biden wins re-election in November, according to the outlet.
So da plan is for the US to add 10million new citizens and also pay $20billion plus a few other minor details…now who do you think is going for such nonsense?  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken…of course 😛
So, now we are victims of an invasion AND shakedown by Mexico?
It’s only Tuesday.
It isn’t Mexico’s doing.
On Day 1 or so, “Biden” destroy’s the Trump administration’s Remain In Mexico deal.
The Biden administration is taking Texas to court over Texas’ attempts to enforce the border.
The administration publicly announces it will seek help fromMexico’s leadership.
Didn’t Mayorkas just go down there?
This is the same thing as that pee pee dossier. Our government made a big public show of going to get a document that they already knew about.
This time, our government is making a big show of going to get a list of demands from Mexico’s president, when it is obvious that our Attorney General made a deal whereby Obrador will pretend that he came up with this on his own.
Maybe they will make him the permanent provincial governor of the North American Region, who knows?
10% for the big guy.

Excerpt:
Welker also asked Stefanik if she would “vote to certify the results of the ’24 election no matter what they show?” Again, refusing to fall into Welker’s trap, Stefanik replied matter of factly, “We will see if this is a legal and valid election.”
This answer has been seized on by the corporate media to somehow insinuate that Stefanik is anti-democratic. Apparently, Welker and the rest of her media peers do not comprehend the point of certifying the presidential election, which is to validate the integrity of the electoral process. In other words, no representative should be committed to certifying or not certifying the election until after it has taken place and been verifiably conducted lawfully.
Bongino made some good points on his podcast today.
— Lloyd Austin is a cabinet member who is in the presidential line of succession. He has a security detail assigned to keep up with him and protect him. Lloyd Austin cannot be accidentally misplaced. (This is akin to a mysterious white powder showing up in a restricted area with closed circuit cameras at the White House but the Secret Service being unable to determine who placed it there.)
— Biden and Obama do not especially like each other. As VP, Biden considered himself to be the brilliant elder statesman.

The ears, chin, Nothing is the same, they claim it is due to plastic surgery.

Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., has declared that Hunter Biden is allowed to refuse to appear in a deposition before any public testimony — the very same demand made by Democrats in the prior Congress. That appears the excuse for Democrats to vote against contempt, but…

“Too Big To Jail.”
Derp State Wingman.
“False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not. They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.” ~ Ps 35:11-17

***Praises – Election Integrity
♦ Thank You, Father, for the continual exposures of corrupt individuals, both inside & outside of Govt.
♦ Thank You for the revelations of the voter fraud that occurred through various election systems (Dominion, ES&S, ERIC voter registration system, etc.), ballot harvesting, ballot trafficking, & other methods.
♦ We pray for success in the efforts to remove these fraudulent election systems & tactics.
♦ Thank You, Father, for the ever increasing efforts of Patriots in various states pushing for election integrity & investigations into voter fraud
♦ Thank You for removing roadblocks & using each apparent roadblock for good to expose the fraudsters, force them to reveal themselves at all levels, & increase the awareness of the country & world to their schemes…
(Gen. 50:20; Ps 1:15, 16; Ps 9:15; Ps 73:17-20; Prov 26:27; I Cor 3:19)
♦ Thank You for the Providential series of events before & after the 2020 election, which prepared Dr. Frank to be able to discover that the baseline for the 2020 vote was created by applying an algorithm that used the 2010 census to fabricate the illusion of registered voters at a state level (inflating the registration databases/voter rolls w/ phantom voters… pre-election), & then results were controlled & regulated by algorithms at the county level.
(Databases & machines are hacked & tracked in real time… showing who voted & didn’t vote; so fraudulent ballots could be printed & filled out for those who didn’t vote, which are then given to the NGOs to distribute to the ballot boxes. The last step of distribution was shown in the “2000 Mules” documentary. Dr. Frank says the ballot box stuffing is a symptom of the fraud. The real fraud took place in the machine. So the key idea is every stuffed ballot has to be assigned to a voter in the voter rolls.)

♦ Thank You for the partial audit that was able to be done in Antrim County (MI).

(9/1/23)

Heavenly Father, we pray in Jesus’ name, according to Thy will…
♦ for 24/7 protection/safety/health/guidance/direction/salvation/provision for the work crews, security personnel, legal teams, USBP, CBPAMO, ICE, USCG (& other LEOs protecting our border & Country), DHS, Army/USACE, National Guard and all involved in Fisher Industries’ private or federal projects (& other wall contractors); & for protection for them, their families & residences/property from any specific targeting.
♦ for the stemming of the tide of illegal alien invasion & human & drug trafficking occurring at our southern border & other avenues of entry; for the correction of the Biden administration’s open border policies causing parts of our border security & other government agencies to become corrupted, demoralized, & misused to distribute these invaders throughout the country.
♦ Thank You, Heavenly Father, for each individual border security agent/officer, LEO, wall builder, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, & American, across the country who continue to set examples for others by faithfully & cheerfully doing their duty in their own small area of influence… in their family, work, Christian congregation, community, & country… despite overwhelming odds… in the face of apparent futility of effort.
“And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” ~ II Cor 12:9
“Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.” ~ II Cor 12:10
“…for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” ~ Phil 4:11b-13
“Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” Isa 40:28-31
“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” ~ II Tim 1:7
“There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us.” ~ I John 4:18, 19
“Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth…
…And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” ~ I Cor 13:4-8a, 13 (1-13) (Rom 5:1-5) (John 15:10-12)
“Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?” ~ James 2:5
“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence.” ~ I Cor 1:26-29
“…out of weakness were made strong…” ~ Heb 11:34b
Hebrews 11 (Heroes of Faith) – Audio
“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.” ~ Heb 12:1-4
“Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” ~ James 5:10, 11
“If I give you one message to hold in your hearts today, it’s this… Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation. Relish the opportunity to be an outsider, because it’s the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
The more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward.” ~ President Donald J. Trump

Wake up!   “Look Squirrel!” War, aliens, pestilence, mayhem, chaos, if it bleeds it leads, privation…you name the distraction.    
 
There is so many disjointed things going on in our great land and around the world it’s hard to know how to consume or disseminate what’s coming at us. Remember, get this clear…the chaos is the point.
But, here we are, “strange days indeed” facing things that simply do not comport with the “norm”.  This is either a great opportunity (The Great Awakening, God, goodness and light ), or our demise (The Great Reset/Build Back Better, satan, darkness and death).
As an optimist I believe the ladder, we’ll see. We must include God and prayer.   
 
Everybody, including me, wants to un-see what we’ve seen and experienced and get back to our “normal” lives. Sadly, on either side of the ledger, this is not going to be the way it’s going to be. Voting is irrelevant, for now. We either get this rampant evil/lunacy corrected or our children and grandchildren will be subjected to these demons whims and they will pay for our foolish debts.
 
Make no mistake about it folks, we’re dealing with entrenched ancient evil and if they push aside MAGA (The army of light) through smoke & mirrors with their enemy MSM hooey the world is done. Sadly, as an ancillary, many of the sleep walking normies are going to end up like the Useful Idiots of old…dead. Oh, come on Stan…that’s ridiculous, prove me wrong. What wouldn’t they do?
 
It’s great that “we” narrowly have the House of Reps in 2022 it should have been more like 2010 political rapture. But, the corrupt system that stole 2020 is still in place and will be used again in the general “unless” it’s fully exposed and corrected.
 
The swamp wants us to get back into their fake world (matrix) of polls, red waves, we’re gonna “throw the bums out silliness, you know, Democrat/Republican/Uniparty nonsense. If anybody believes that these institutional criminals are going to just roll over and allow a MAGA victory in 2024 via voting…not to be overly harsh, are delusional.
 
Oh, in the present system, as a fun ancillary, keep in mind, all of these dedicated swamp rats “voted out” in the fraudulent system are going to simply move over to K-Street, Think Tanks or some other sleazy swamp organ and “make some real money”. Maybe a wonderful duffle-bag full of cash…or a swamp rat favorite, mysterious campaign contributions that just simply move it to their personal accounts (see: Maxine Waters). Or a lake home for Bernie Sanders. If you point out the criminality they will scream raaaacist, or some such nonsense.  
 
Here in Georgia our swamp rat (Governor) who massively allowed cheating in the elections, governor (WEF) Kemp has amassed an extra $7 + million since being in office and Stacey “the linebacker” Abrams a nobody dummycrat idiot who is a multi-millionaire now as well. Pretty cool huh? …spit.
 
There needs to be real justice for all of these swamp rats and their handlers or the crimes will continue. Inside of this we can answer our own questions, “Why would somebody spend $20 Million to win a job that makes $160k per year?” $$$MONEY$$$ ,,,and POWER
 
We’re in the 3rd Act of a Greek tragedy and the world will know “who done it”. 
In order to correct this, we must see clearly see who and what our enemy is, this is now happening on a daily basis. 
Keep in faith and prayer.   
IMHO these people, like Abrams and Kemp (and all the rest of ’em and I mean all the rest of ’em!)…they are happy with only peanuts from the WEF crowd?
WEF can afford to do them much better than short sighted mere millions…have they, the WEF supporters-AKA WEFies) have no sense of ‘self worth’???
These WEFies need to stand up for themselves and demand more…far more. These WEFies are a bunch of wimps and are being cheated….they need to demand their pay be in accordance with what they have done and do….even if ol’ Klaus gets bankrupted….
I don’t know if anyone has made the connection….I am sure someone has but its worth saying it again as I get off of the New Hampshire thread…
The sudden push by Plouffe to suggest dems vote for NimRATs….to steal from Trump’s vote numbers….
This certainly explains why NimRATS pulled down statues and Confederate flags.  I suspect this operation was planned long ago…to steal vote numbers from the Donald…one more strategy in the War on and For America.
“Birdbrain” is too soft and too kind a nickname….IMO it implies an inability to think rationally.  There is much ‘rational’ thought to achieve the end goal.

Fulton County DA Fani Willis: Her Affair with the Special Prosecutor
https://technofog.substack.com/p/fulton-county-da-fani-willis-her?
‘No one is safe if they had any hand in’ Oct. 7
For eight years, the U.S. State Department has offered a reward of up to $5 million for information on the whereabouts of Saleh Arouri, a Hamas terrorist whose hands were dripping red.
This week, Israel found him.
Arouri was killed on Tuesday with two other Hamas military leaders in an explosion outside of Beirut in Lebanon. Israeli officials wouldn’t comment on the development, but The New York Times reported that U.S. and other sources “ascribed the attack” to the Jewish state.
“No one is safe if they had any hand in planning, raising money for or carrying out” the Oct. 7 attacks, an unnamed U.S. official told the Times. “This is just the beginning, and it’ll go on for years.”
It’s important to note that Arouri had a bloody resume. The State Department said that he had been “linked to several terrorist attacks, hijackings and kidnappings.” One such crime was the 2014 abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, including one who was also an American citizen.
Arouri was involved in coordinating cooperation between Iran and its terror proxy Hezbollah.
