LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP)
— Johnny Furphy had career-highs of 23 points and 11 rebounds,
Kevin McCullar Jr. added 20 points and seventh-ranked Kansas beat
Cincinnati 74-69 in the first Big 12 matchup between the schools. KJ
Adams Jr. added 11 points and Hunter Dickinson overcame foul trouble
to score 10 for the Jayhawks. They bounced back from their loss at
West Virginia and extended their homecourt winning streak to 15
games. Dan Skillings Jr. led Cincinnati with 16 points.
WACO, Texas (AP) — Eliza Maupin, Gabby Gregory and Serena Sundell each had 16 points and fourth-ranked Kansas State extended its winning streak to 13 games with a 58-55 win over 13th-ranked Baylor. The Wildcats played without injured standout center Ayoka Lee, rallying from a 13-point, first-half deficit. With Baylor trying for a game-tying shot at the end, Jaelyn Glenn blocked a game-ending 3-point attempt by Dre’Una Edwards. The 19-1 Wildcats had moved up three spots in the new Associated Press poll earlier Monday for their highest ranking since 2003. Maupin's 3-pointer with just over 7 minutes left gave them their first lead since the game’s first two minutes. Bella Fontleroy had 12 points and Edwards had 11 for 15-3 Baylor.
UNDATED (AP) — The
AP Top 25 had another week of upheaval, with teams bouncing around
like kernels in a popcorn maker. The same two teams remain at the top
amid the poll turmoil. Reigning national champion Connecticut stayed
No. 1 in The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll,
receiving 44 first-place votes from a 61-person media panel. No. 2
Purdue had 17 first-place votes. A loss by Kansas jumbled the rest of
the top five. No. 3 North Carolina, No. 4 Houston and No. 5 Tennessee
all moved up a spot by sweeping two games each last week. No. 25 New
Mexico moved into the rankings for the first time this season after a
pair of wins.
UNDATED (AP) —
Kansas State has its best ranking in 21 years after the Wildcats
moved up to fourth in The Associated Press women’s basketball poll.
The Wildcats, who climbed three spots, were last ranked this high in
2003. South Carolina remains the unanimous choice at No. 1 in the
poll, receiving all 35 votes from a national media panel. The
Gamecocks cruised to easy wins over Kentucky and Texas A&M. There
was some shifting in the top 10, with UCLA moving back up to No. 2
after beating Colorado on the road. The Buffaloes remained in the
third spot. Iowa dropped to fifth after falling in overtime to Ohio
State.
UNDATED (AP) — The
Big 12 can make an argument as college basketball’s best conference
the past few years, with two national champions in three years and
multiple teams making the NCAA Tournament each season. This season
has been no different. Even with TCU dropping out, the Big 12 led the
way in this week’s AP Top 25 with seven ranked teams, led by No. 4
Houston and No. 7 Kansas. The slate includes Houston at No. 20 BYU,
No. 23 Iowa State at Kansas and No. 20 Texas Tech at No. 11 Oklahoma.
UNDATED (AP) — The
visual of one of the nation’s most popular athletes knocked to the
floor after a fan who was staring at her phone collided with her
while storming the court was a stark reminder of the dangers athletes
face when crowds get out of control. Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark was
shaken up but not injured in the collision, which occurred Sunday as
she headed toward the locker room with teammates following a 100-92
loss to then-No. 18 Ohio State in Columbus. It was the second time in
less than two weeks that fans have stormed the court at the end of a
Big Ten game.
NASHVILLE, Tenn.
(AP) — The Tennessee Titans have agreed to hire Cincinnati Bengals
offensive coordinator Brian Callahan as their head coach. That's
according to a person familiar with the decision who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal hadn't
been finalized. Callahan replaces Mike Vrabel, who was fired on Jan.
9 after six seasons. The 39-year-old Callahan had a virtual interview
with Tennessee on Jan. 12, the first of 10 candidates to speak to the
team. The Titans interviewed Callahan in person on Monday and decided
to hire him. Callahan has been the Bengals' offensive coordinator
since 2019.
OWINGS MILLS, Md.
(AP) — The Baltimore Ravens are trying to reach their first Super
Bowl in 11 years. The last team standing in the way is the Kansas
City Chiefs. The Chiefs will be in town Sunday for the AFC
championship game. That means a showdown with Patrick Mahomes and a
stout Kansas City defense. And yes, the Ravens will have to contend
with Travis Kelce — the tight end whose romance with Taylor Swift
has brought the pop superstar to NFL games around the country this
season. Baltimore beat Houston 34-10 on Saturday.
