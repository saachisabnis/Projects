Taylor Swift has changed song lyrics in honor of her boyfriend Travis Kelce.
The “Bad Blood” singer, 34, who has been dating the Super Bowl-winning NFL tight end, also 34, is being supported on her Eras Tour by the athlete and made the lyrics alteration during a concert in Sydney, Australia.
Swift made the swap in tribute to the Kansas City Chiefs player while singing her 2022 tune “Karma” at her gig in the city on Friday, Feb. 23, singing: “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs,” as an homage to the Kansas City Chiefs tight end.
Video of the moment showed her fans shrieking in delight at the reference to Kelce, who wore a wrist full of friendship bracelets for the event.
The gig also saw Swift point to Kelce as he sat in the VIP section waving to and high-fiving fans, and at the end of the show, the couple kissed and left the Accor Stadium together.
Swift previously made the same change to her “Karma” lyrics during her performance in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 2023 when Kelce first saw her Eras Tour.
Kelce later told his fellow NFL player brother Jason Kelce, 36, on their “New Heights” podcast left him stunned.
“I had no clue. Well, I might have had a little bit of a clue, but definitely, when I heard it come out of her mouth, it still shocked me. It was like, ‘Oh, she really just said that,” he said.
Swift and Kelce confirmed their relationship when appeared at a Chiefs game in September 2023, and Swift now attended more than 10 games throughout Travis’ season and was present for both the AFC Championship and Super Bowl, which the Chiefs won over the San Francisco49ers.
