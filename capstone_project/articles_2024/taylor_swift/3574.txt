See how the Grammy winner and other celebrities are reacting to the solar eclipse
Taylor Swift used the appearance of the solar eclipse to tease songs that are seemingly set to be featured on her upcoming album, “The Tortured Poets Department.” 
“Crowd goes wild at her fingertips. Half moonshine, full eclipse,” the Grammy award-winning singer wrote on the social platform X (formerly Twitter) and in an Instagram story on Monday. The post was coupled with an image of a typewriter writing out the lyrics. 
Swift’s 11th studio album drops on April 19.  
But she wasn’t the only celebrity who took joy in celebrating the solar eclipse on Monday.

“Saw the eclipse. Go back to work,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, Danny Trejo (“Machete”) playfully made a joke out of the event, saying his only concern was chips and salsa. 
“The only eclipse I care about tbh,” Trejo wrote.
