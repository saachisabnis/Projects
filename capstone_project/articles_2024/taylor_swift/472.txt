    Statues of men who fought for freedom are eeeevil. Statues of dribblers good. Local Miami media is drooling with joy over this.

Well out. That was my first reaction, too.
Consequential, brave, heroic men are smashed and destroyed.
A grown man playing a child’s game is honored.
What an effed up country.

Dwyane Wade was a slave owner.

The only statues our country erects these days are for victims, sports stars, and degrading and disembodying views of deconstructed, abstract humans.

Moving a ball (whether it be base, soft, soccer, foot, basket, volley, golf, or whatever) is vanity. Yet somehow, as a kid on the farm, my siblings and I found fun in about anything.
We played in the nearby stream, or made bows and arrows out of branches from a willow tree, made houses and forts out of square straw or hay bales (or snow), climbed trees, and on and on.
Nowadays a kid has to play a sport in order to have fun, and then they are pushed by obsessed parents as though its so very very important.

    (A grown man playing a child’s game is honored.)  Drugs, worship of rap, basketball 🏀, football 🏈, hedonism, the deceitfulness of riches, dykes and fairies, Taylor Swift, COVID-19 (84), mass unchecked invasion and a planet Earth 🌎🌍 potentially on the verge of World War III.  Not a good mix.....😲😱😳  Notice the 5th image of the Manchurian Candidate in the panel below >

Are there any statues to the greatest video gamers yet? If not, that’s a terrible injustice! (SARC)

    Not entirely true. We erect statues to murderous villains who destroyed entire nations, too.

Exactly
And that’s even what the worship of Taylor Swift is.
Bread 🍞🍞🍞 and Circuses 🎪🎪🎪🤡🤡🤡 for the bored masses.
Who are unaware what Almighty God has said is coming to planet Earth 🌎🌍.

And life seemed to continue as normal, with no idea what was coming; ignorant of the Word of God.

Luke 17:26-32
King James Version
26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
32 Remember Lot’s wife.
