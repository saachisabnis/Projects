She’s blinging in the new year. 
Hailey Bieber rocked an itty bitty bikini with a seriously high-end accessory as she kicked off 2024 in a new Instagram post, sharing a variety of photos from a sunny new year’s getaway aboard a yacht.
“2024… I’m along for the ride 🤪” the 27-year-old Rhode founder captioned the carousel of photos, which were taken during her recent tropical NYE holiday near Barbados with friends including husband Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny.
She showed off her bottom in a cheeky thong bikini bottom in two of the pics, wearing a green style with yellow trim by Miaou ($80) and a matching triangle top.
The model paired her tiny suit with a white button-up shirt as she showed her behind to the camera in another snap, removing the top in a subsequent pic to reveal a $16,000 Jacquie Aiche yellow gold diamond body chain as she posed on a yacht.
This isn’t the first time Bieber has accessorized with the celeb-fave jeweler’s body chains; she paired a pink bikini with a different diamond style in 2021. 
Jacquie Aiche’s high-end pieces have been worn by numerous celebrities, with everyone from Taylor Swift to Heidi Klum rocking her styles, including a nearly $5,000 diamond bra once sported by the likes of Rihanna, Vanessa Hudgens and Emily Ratajkowski.

In another photo, the skincare guru rocks the pantsless trend by posing in only a striped blue T-shirt on the beach, and she modeled a sparkling metal mesh patterned skirt by Christopher Esber ($995) with a $70 cropped white Èterne tank in a dreamy sunset pic. 
Justin Bieber’s wife wore a towel around her head in another sandy snap, trading a beach bag for a white Goyard tote while flaunting her flawless makeup-free skin.
Fans were into her body-baring ‘fits, like one who commented, “I didn’t know she had cheeks like that 👀.”
“Obsessed w you” influencer Alix Earle wrote, while Kylie Jenner left a row of heart-eye emojis on the post.
Her tropical vacation follows a snowy escape to Aspen in December when Hailey modeled a bra top, miniskirt and enormous feathered coat in front of a chilly landscape and again linked up with bestie Kendall for multiple dinners and snowboarding outings. 
No doubt there will be more stylish adventures ahead for the Biebers in 2024.
