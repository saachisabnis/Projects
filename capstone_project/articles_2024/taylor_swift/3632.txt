Yes, I'm still holding out for a collab!!!
Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray are two of music's biggest stars thanks to their killer songwriting chops—and they just so happen to be best friends, too. The pair initially met on the internet "just like everyone else our age," according to Conan, and they openly mused about their mutual love for Taylor Swift on their social timelines. Since then, Liv and Conan have danced at awards shows together, taken vacays with their besties Iris Apatow and Madison Hu, and even sparked collaboration rumors. Now, if that's not a friendship worthy of a Grammy-nominated album, I don't know what is. 🥹  
Ready to revisit the best moments of Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray's friendship timeline? Go back to the beginning with all the details below.
Olivia wrote and performed "All I Want" for High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and the track eventually went viral on TikTok. In a June 2022 interview on The Today Show, Conan revealed that his friendship with Liv started via DM when he first heard it.
"I remember I messaged her because I heard a song she'd written years ago called 'All I Want' and I was like, 'That's the best song I've heard in a very long time,'" he told host Hoda Katb.
Olivia and Conan were some of the few lucky folks who got an advanced stream of Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Liv posted this *very real* account of their experience:
Speaking of Tay's Fearless re-record, the Grammy winner enlisted Olivia and Conan to post a promotional video ahead of its drop on April 9. The duo paid homage to Taylor's music video for "You Belong With Me" with handwritten signs.

Conan gushed about his friendship with Olivia in a conversation with Rolling Stone, saying, "I very much value quality over quantity in my life. With Olivia, she's someone that I just adore. And it's always nice to have friends that you can depend on. [Fame] is a very confusing thing, and it's nice to have people that you can relate to and find comfort in."
Conan dropped his sophomore album, Superache, featuring a song called "Best Friend." Fans theorized that the track was partly inspired by his friendship with Olivia. 
Not! To! Mention! The official lyric video is formatted to look like Instagram DMs, which is how the duo initially connected in 2020. S'cute!
While fans began theorizing (and manifesting) a musical collaboration between Conan and Olivia, he put rumors to rest during an interview with PopBuzz. The main theory at the time was that they wrote a track called "Dreamlike" together. "People love to make things up and then nobody cares, on the internet, if something is true or not," Conan explained. "That song doesn't exist. I'm sorry to let people down."
