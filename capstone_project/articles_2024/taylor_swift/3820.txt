Given their doting smiles and clasped hands whenever they're out and about together, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem good for each other. 
And they're definitely good for business.
When the couple was spotted together at Coachella this weekend, for instance, Swift sported a green "New Heights" hat in a nod to Kelce's podcast that he shares with his brother, Jason Kelce.
As their relationship developed since its start last summer, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end frequently dropped details on his podcast to the sheer delight of Swifties, who regularly scour for easter eggs about the pop star's life and discography.
In addition to promoting the tight end's podcast, Swift also donned his Chiefs gear while cheering him on during his NFL season, which culminated in a Super Bowl win in February. Swifties picked up on that, too, with some international fans wearing Chiefs merch when seeing Swift in concert during her Eras Tour.
While Swift has promoted Kelce's ventures, the NFL star has done the same for her. In September, he donned a 1989-themed fit in a nod to "1989 (Taylor's Version)", Swift's rerecorded album.
Their dual economic impact extends beyond themselves. 
The owner of the Chiefs credited Swift with growing the team's female viewership, and some experts estimated she made the team over $300 million, Newsweek reported. 
The demand for her Eras Tour tickets soared so high, meanwhile, that it broke the Ticketmaster site, leading to a Congressional inquiry into the ticketseller. 
Swift's American concerts injected over $5 billion into the national economy. In fact, from concert stops to appearances at NFL games, Swift creates a burgeoning mini-economy everywhere she goes.
Spokespersons for Swift, Kelce, and New Heights did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on Sunday.
