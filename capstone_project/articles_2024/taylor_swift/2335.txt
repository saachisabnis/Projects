KANSAS CITY, Mo. (WDAF) — When Taylor Swift isn’t selling out stadiums for “The Eras Tour” or at Kansas City Chiefs games supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, she’s baking goodies.
Swift showed off her baking skills by making the Chiefs offensive linemen “homemade Pop-Tarts,” head coach Andy Reid revealed at the NFL Combine.
“She likes to cook, so she made the offensive linemen these homemade Pop-Tarts,” Reid said.  “She didn’t give me one, and the offensive linemen definitely didn’t give me one.”
Reid didn’t say when she made the baked goods for the team.
Pop-Tarts has since caught wind of the Swift-made treats and is hoping the pop star will share her recipe.

“…We heard there’s a Pop-Tarts pastry (Your Version),” the company said in an Instagram post, playing off of Swift’s rerecorded songs and albums, all labeled “Taylor’s Version.” The image itself mimicked Swift’s iconic Eras Tour graphic for an extra Swiftie shimmer.
The post went on to explain that in honor of Swift’s treats, Pop-Tarts will donate $12,500 to Harvesters, a Feeding America partner food bank in Kansas City.
However, if Swift shares the recipe, Pop-Tarts says it will double that donation.
“We’re tortured not knowing more about this DIY delight,” read an ad, taken out by Pop-Tarts parent company, Kellanova, in The Kansas City Star. “What’s the filling? Does it have frosting? Do they have little holes?”
It’s unclear if Swift will release that recipe. She did, however, post a handwritten cookie recipe, seen here, on Tumblr years ago.
