Kanye West has dropped a remix to the controversial track that kicked off the current Hip Hop wars, and his entry takes shots at both Drake and J. Cole,
On Saturday (April 20), video of Ye premiering his remix of Metro Boomin and Future‘s “Like That” was posted by The Download With Justin Laboy.

The track opens with West nodding to Drake’s current beef with Kendrick Lamar by saying, “Yo Dot, I got you.” It was Lamar’s shots at Drizzy and Cole on the original “Like That” which began all the current back-and-forths.
It then appears to reference the ongoing Diddy sexual assault allegations with the line: “Can’t stop, won’t stop/ I just fucked your bitch in a Sean John tank top.”

The verse ends with direct shots at Drizzy and Cole: “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind / I can’t even think of a Drake line/ Play J. Cole, get the pussy dry.”
Check it out below.
Ye’s verse surfaced shortly after an AI-enhanced Drake diss track dropped that featured the artificially generated voices of both 2Pac and Snoop Dogg.
On Friday (April 19), less than a week after “Push Ups” leaked online, the Canadian superstar amped up his feud with K.Dot with a new joint. Whereas the authenticity of his first counterattack was under speculation for a while, “Taylor Made Freestyle” openly embraces artificial intelligence with features from the computer-generated voices of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg to convey perspectives in addition to Drizzy’s — using lyrics that Drake wrote.

After using the two legends’ viewpoints to press his adversary to drop a response, the 37-year-old references Taylor Swift‘s new album and TDE boss Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith with the bars: “But now we gotta wait a fucking week ’cause Taylor Swift is your new Top/ And if you ’bout to drop, she gotta approve/ This girl really ’bout to make you act like you not in a feud/ She tailor made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop.”
Soon after the track went live, Akademiks revealed during a livestream that he received a text from the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker that reads: “Ak, you know I was trying to come off tour and relax. N-ggas done fucked up my whole feng shui. Now I gotta eat until this debate is done.”

The Compton native also reportedly has a response ready to go, according to Joe Budden Podcast host Antwan “Ish” Marby, who also claims its viciousness is comparable to 2Pac‘s “Hit Em Up.”
