KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV/Gray News) - Charges have been filed against two teenagers after one person died and 22 were injured in a shooting following the Kansas City Chiefs championship parade.
The Jackson County Family Court Division announced Friday that two juveniles have been charged in connection to the mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs rally on Wednesday.
The teens remain behind bars at the Juvenile Detention Center on gun-related charges as well as resisting arrest.
Additional charges are expected as the investigation by the Kansas City, Missouri, Police Department continues.
The teens were arrested following the shooting on Wednesday.
A third adult was also detained but was later released.
The court noted that no further information, including the names of the suspects, has been released as the suspects are juveniles.
During the shooting, which police believe to be the result of an argument between two parties, Lisa Lopez-Galvan was killed. 
A GoFundMe has been set up to help support her family through the tragedy. The fund received support from Taylor Swift, megastar and girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, with a $100,000 donation.
Meanwhile, the 22 other victims continue to recover from their injuries. On Wednesday, 11 victims were taken to Children’s Mercy Hospital, nine of whom suffered gunshot wounds. 
As of Friday, one of those victims remained in the hospital.
