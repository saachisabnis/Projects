	The Kansas City Chiefs are Swifties!

	Tight end Jordy Fortson Jr. took to his Instagram Stories over the weekend to post a video singing along to Taylor Swift’s 1989 hit, “Bad Blood,” in celebration of his team’s playoff win against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday (Jan. 21).

	The song choice is fitting, as Swift was in attendance at the game supporting her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce.

	Swift — who’s been spending many of her weekends cheering on Travis, tight end for the Chiefs — also brought a couple of her friends to the game in Buffalo: Cara Delevigne and Ashley Avignone. Last weekend Swift braved the cold in below-zero temperatures in Kansas City.
