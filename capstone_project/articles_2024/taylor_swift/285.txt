With holiday songs now gone from the Billboard Hot 100, Jack Harlow’s ‘Lovin On Me’ rebounds from No. 9 back to No. 1, where it first spent a week in early December. It’s Harlow’s third chart-topping hit following ‘First Class’ and ‘Industry Baby’ (with Lil Nas X). Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” is back at No. 2, after four non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in October. Tate McRae’s first top 10 hit, ‘Greedy,’ is now her first top 5 song as well, landing at No. 3 this week. Doja Cat’s “Paint the Town Red” is No. 4 while Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything” rounded out the top 5.
