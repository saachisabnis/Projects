Jake's Backroom will be hosting DJ Swiftie's Tay Tay Dance Party next month. If you're a big T-Swift fan, this is your night! The dance party includes 2 hours of non-stop Taylor Swift music AND features a national touring light show. Sounds like it's going to be pretty friggin' cool.
It's all going down in Jake's Backroom on May 2nd from 7 until 10:30 pm. You can purchase your tickets in advance by clicking here, or you can buy them at the door. Regular tickets are $20 and VIP are $35.
I have a feeling this is going to be pretty packed. There are SO MANY Swifties out there. Are you one?
I'll admit, I am not a massive fan of her music, BUT I do think she's a pretty awesome person. She does a lot of nice things for people and I think she makes a great role model for young girls. Also, anybody who likes cats even half as much as I do is badass in my book.
When someone asks me how I feel about Taylor Swift, I usually just mention my favorite Swift quote:
"Just adopt cats. And, then if you're lonely, adopt another one. And just keep it up."
I took that advice to heart after my last breakup and brought home a new kitten. I'm telling you, it helped me out through a hard time to have a snuggle little fluff muffin to cuddle on. Solid advice, Taylor.
If you go out and get your dance on at the Tay Tay Dance Party, I'd love to see your photos! Send them to me at Chrissy.Covington@townsquaremedia.com for a chance to have them featured in a follow-up article about the experience.
