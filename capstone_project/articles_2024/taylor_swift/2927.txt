I am deeply grateful for the love and support from my kids, family, team and all of you!”

Fans remember Dion posted an emotional Instagram video revealing her diagnosis in December 2022. At the time, she shared the need to pause her world tour in order to get better.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke describes SPS as a rare condition that can cause stiff muscles throughout the body and cause a higher sensitivity to noises and touch, leading to muscle spasms. Additionally, the Stiff Person Syndrome Research Foundation notes the disorder can affect the central nervous system, including the brain and the spinal cord.
