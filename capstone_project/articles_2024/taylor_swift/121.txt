Why it matters: Orange County pediatrician Eric Ball, who has seen an uptick in COVID-19 patients at his practice, worries that the return to school and daycare will see more children infected in the coming weeks. 
“We really have no medications to treat COVID for children, so we do worry a little bit more when kids get COVID, especially kids who have not been vaccinated, because some of them do get quite ill,” Ball said.
Why now: The newly dominant JN.1 variant is sweeping across the nation. The uptick in patients pushed L.A. County into the CDC's medium tier, triggering a temporary mask mandate in health facilities.
What's next: Public health officials advise using rapid tests if you feel sick before returning to work and school, as cases are expected to rise.
