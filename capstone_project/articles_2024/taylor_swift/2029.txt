Taylor Swift is sticking to her word and keeping Us on our toes with her surprise song choices.
The Grammy winner, 34, played four songs total at her Eras Tour show in Sydney on Saturday, February 24, in two mash-ups. Swift first mashed up “Should’ve Said No” from her self-titled debut album with “You’re Not Sorry” from Fearless.
“The choice is yours, you can sing it American like me or you can just be yourselves and you can say ‘Should’ve Said Naur,’” Swift quipped to the crowd at Accor Stadium, using an Australian dialect on the word “no.”
Next up, Swift combined Folklore’s “Peace” with Reputation’s “New Year’s Day” in a sweet piano ballad.
Swift’s first concert in Sydney one day earlier also featured a mash-up, when she brought out opening act Sabrina Carpenter for a duet of “White Horse” and “Coney Island.”
The surprise song choice comes shortly after Swift announced that she will no longer be banning herself from performing any acoustic “surprise songs” more than once while on the Eras Tour. She confirmed the change during a show in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday, February 18.
Since kicking off her record-breaking Eras Tour in March 2023, the songstress has debuted a 44-song setlist. At each show, she adds two surprise acoustic tracks, which have been dubbed “surprise songs” by Swifties.

While she previously told fans that she wouldn’t repeat any surprise songs while on tour (a rule she’s already broken more than once), the “Blank Space” singer just revealed that that ban is officially over.
“That was to challenge me to really get to all the ones that I just don’t naturally gravitate towards, and I feel really proud about having done that,” the singer told the crowd. “But this is sort of a public service announcement to everyone who might be anywhere else on the tour, or whatever, or watching this — we have a lot of people, we’re very lucky to have a lot of people watch this on the internet and care about these shows if they’re not here.”
She continued, “I’ve just been kind of rethinking, and I’ve been thinking I want to be as creative as possible with the acoustic set moving forward and I don’t want to limit anything or say, ‘If I played this song, I can’t play it again.'”
Swift explained that she wants to play surprise songs “more than once if I feel like it” and to be able to make “changes” to certain tunes.
“Does that sound OK?” she then asked the 96,000-strong crowd, which responded with thunderous applause inside Melbourne Cricket Ground.
