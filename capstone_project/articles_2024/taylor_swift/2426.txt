Taylor Swift's Eras Tour continued it's international journey on Sunday night in Singapore (morning in the United States). The now 14-time Grammy winner will be touring almost non-stop for the entire year, and at each show she adds two "surprise songs" to her 44-song, three hour plus set list.

For the fourth of six nights in Singapore, Swift once again went with the mashups that she's been so fond of in 2024. On the guitar, she played a combination of "Death By A Thousand Cuts" from Lover and "Babe" from Red. On piano, Swift went with a mashup of "Fifteen" from Fearless mixed with "You're On Your Own Kid" from Midnights.
Swift will perform two more shows in Singapore before taking off April for the launch of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
