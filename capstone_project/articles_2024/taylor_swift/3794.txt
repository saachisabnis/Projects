Did you know you can order fresh flowers on Amazon? You’re welcome!

Who needs a card when you can say it with a candle? Emblazoned with “Thank you, Mom” this one is made of natural soy wax and scented with bergamot, lavender and sage. Importantly, Mom won’t have to save it for a special occasion—it provides 60 to 80 hours of burn time.

If you’ve heard of a singer named Taylor Swift, you know that friendship bracelets are in right now. This one is made by the women-founded brand, Little Words Project, which makes dozens of meaningful word bracelets. The “Mama” style is perfect for this occasion and made out of plated brass and hand-crafted crystal and stone beads. If you want to splurge, add another themed bracelet to her stack that channels good energy or faith. 
Cozy Earth
These Cozy Earth pajamas make getting out of bed in the morning even tougher, but that’s only because they’re so comfy. The set is created with a moisture-wicking fabric (ideal for those who sleep hot) and the viscose, bamboo blend is also super soft on the skin. Sweet dreams, indeed.

Mother’s Day is all about treating your mama to something special, and a box of ridiculously delicious chocolates definitely qualifies as a treat. Made by California-based See’s Candies, this gift set contains 26 pieces of milk chocolate and a mixture of toppings and fillings like almonds, caramels, nougat, buttercream and more. Sorry, but we can’t guarantee Mom will want to share.

A nice frame and a family photo is always a thoughtful gift, but you can level up this year with a nice frame and hundreds of photos. The Aura Digital Picture Frame allows you to send photos directly from your phone to the frame, so mom can get updated pics of you to display in real time. The screen will automatically adjust for brightness and crop the photo perfectly. We especially love this gift for anyone who has recently been promoted to grandma.

There’s a reason this hairdryer is written about everywhere and hyped up by all who own it. The Dyson Supersonic dries hair fast without using extreme heat, which can damage strands and your scalp. It’s the perfect solution for women who want to dry their hair regularly, but still keep it healthy. 
Amazon
These Oscar de la Renta earrings are basically dangling works of art. Made in Italy, the 100% brass pieces hang approximately 1.5 inches and have post backs (so pierced ears only, here). They’re a cool way to treat Mom to a subtle designer piece. And if these aren’t quite her style? Amazon has plenty of other Oscar de la Renta accessories to choose from. 
Amazon
KitchenAid mixers are a must-have for professional and home bakers. While they come in plenty of colors, this matte black one has an undeniable cool factor and will look right at home in any neutral kitchen. It’s the 3.5 quart version, which means it’s lighter and smaller than the 5 quart (yay, free counter space!), but it’s just as powerful. 
Amazon
This chic gold Oura ring looks swanky at first glance, but it’s what’s on the inside that really counts here. It’s filled with sensors that are able to accurately measure heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature, activity and sleep, so mom can track her health without any additional effort. While you’re at it, maybe you need one, too?
Amazon
Whether she’s heading to work, dinner with friends or just out to run some errands, this Rebecca Minkoff bag is the perfect piece. Made out of sturdy 100% leather, the tote is big enough to fit a little bit of everything (including snacks for the kids) and has a back slip pocket for the little things she’ll need fast like car keys and lip balm.
Amazon
You don’t have to spend a ton of money to grab the gift of a lifetime. This little journal costs less than $10, but it’s the thought that counts. Each page has a prompt where you can write about your favorite memories and answer questions like “I always want to hear what you have to say about ____.”  It’s sentimental, one-of-a-kind and Mom will hold onto it forever.
Amazon
Upgrade her breakfast in bed with this sweet set of spreads. Nine little jars of preserves, jellies and honey come in this made-for-mom hand-illustrated gift box. She’ll have her choice of marmalades (grape, fig, orange and more) to dress up her Mother’s Day toast and pancakes.
Amazon
Sure, there are apps for storing recipes, but there’s something lovely and aesthetically pleasing about having a tangible way for Mom to write down all of her go-to meals and desserts. This book also comes with a few pages of prompts at the beginning so Mom can answer questions about the first dish she ever made and her favorite meal of all time.
Amazon
Makeup bags go through a ton of wear and tear, so it’s almost guaranteed that your Mom needs a new one. This quilted style by Bagsmart is made of water-resistant fabric and has two mesh pockets to hold smaller items like cosmetics. Not to worry, there’s also plenty of room to hold her extensive collection of night creams and serums.
Amazon
Dog moms deserve gifts, too! This sweatshirt can be customized to show a simple, modern outline of her favorite cat or dog. All you need to do is send in an image of Mom’s furry friend and you can also have Fido’s name embroidered on the sleeve for an extra special touch.
Amazon
An alarm clock might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you’re brainstorming gift ideas, but trust us, she’ll love this. The Hatch Restore 2 uses gentle sunrise-like light to gently wake the user, so no more jarring siren noises. It can also play tons of white noise and nature sounds. Basically, you’re giving her the best sleep and wake-up call she’s had in a long time. 
Amazon
Nothing shows that you care (and that you thought about Mother’s Day with plenty of time to spare) quite like a personalized gift. Add your family name or your mom’s first name to this stoneware utensil holder and fill it with new staples like nice wooden spoons for a thoughtful but useful gift. 
Amazon
Fancy skincare is the kind of thing she may not splurge on for herself, but will be thrilled to receive. She can pack these travel versions of Tula Skincare (a cult favorite) to take on a trip, on the go or just to use in her morning routine at home. The set includes an exfoliating sugar scrub, hydrating moisturizer, purifying face cleanser and a Vitamin C serum. 
Amazon
Is it really “me time” if she doesn't have one, two or three of her favorite beverages close by? Tea lovers will appreciate this six-piece set that comes with four-ounce tins of fruity loose leaf tea by Harney & Sons. The six flavors include blood orange, mango, peach, goji berry, strawberry kiwi and orange passion fruit. 
Amazon
How beautiful is this bubble bath? Lollia is known for creating luxe products with stunning packaging and this item is a prime example. The moisturizing formula is packed with olive and avocado oils and has a soft fragrance of white tea, bergamot and honeysuckle. Just a few drops will make a regular old bath feel like a spa experience. 
Amazon
Tense shoulder and neck muscles are no match for this heated (or cooling, you choose!) neck wrap, which provides gentle pressure to ease pain and promote relaxation. Best of all, it’s tiny enough for her to pack in her work bag for those days that are bound to be stressful.  
Amazon
Her bath routine is about to get way more luxurious. This sleek acacia wood tray can safely fit over most tubs and the little legs on the bottom prevent tipping, which is pretty important when she’s balancing her glass of wine, her favorite book and a scented candle on it. If that sounds like a lot of stuff, don’t worry—it can hold up to 200 pounds.
