Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco sat courtside in Los Angeles this week to watch the L.A. Lakers take on the Miami Heat, their first public outing since she confirmed they've been dating for six months. The couple cuddled and held hands during the game, which the Lakers lost 96-110. Gomez has been raving about her time with Blanco, calling him “better than anyone I’ve ever been with. Facts,” and revealing that “he has treated me better than any human being on this planet.” The two have been inseparable lately, with Blanco even accompanying Gomez to Taylor Swift's birthday party.
