Among the top 20 richest people, fourteen are U.S. citizens, with eight of them ranking in the top ten. 
However, the richest person in the world is still French businessman and investor Bernard Arnault, who boasted a staggering $233 billion. 
Overseeing the LVMH luxury fashion empire of 75 brands and cosmetics labels, including Louis Vuitton, Sephora and Tiffany & Co, the 75-year-old from Roubaix, France, was worth an estimated $22 billion more than he was 12 months ago, according to Forbes' calculations.
Followed closely behind is runner-up Elon Musk, whose fortune climbed a more modest $15 billion, reaching $195 billion this year.  
The Tesla and Space X founder, who acquired Twitter in October 2022, continues to battle for second place with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
