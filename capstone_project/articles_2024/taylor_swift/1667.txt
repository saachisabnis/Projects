Kanye West and one of his close associates are shutting down Brandon Marshall’s claims about that the rapper was kicked out of the Super Bowl due to his proximity to Taylor Swift.
The former NFL star’s account of the events surrounding Ye and Super Bowl LVIII earlier this week were picked up by a number of outlets.
However, on Wednesday (February 14), a rep for the Chicago native shut down the rumor in a statement to HipHopDX that reads: “This is a completely fabricated story. It’s not true.”

John Monopoly, Ye’s former manager who was present at the event, also disputed the gossip soon after it began making the rounds online.
In the comments section of a Hollywood Unlocked post about the alleged incidents, he wrote: “This is not true.”

During an interview on the Paper Route podcast earlier this week, Marshall said the “Flashing Lights’ hitmaker had bought a ticket directly in front of Swift’s booth to get in on her airtime, which enraged the pop star.
“Kanye West pulls up to Vegas. Kanye West buys a ticket to right in front of Katy Perry’s booth, so any time they were going to be showing Katy Perry, Kanye’s face was going to be there,” the former Denver Bronco said.

Marshall then realized he had mistaken Perry for Taylor Swift, who was famously interrupted by West at the 2009 MTV VMAs and has had a complicated relationship with the rapper ever since.
“He’s got a mask on with his logo on the mask — typical Kanye,” he continued. “Taylor Swift gets pissed off, she boom, boom makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. He gets kicked out the stadium! He was trying to leverage her celebrity … That’s what he tried to do; he tried to sit in front of Taylor Swift.”

Despite Marshall’s claims, Kanye West was seen several times inside Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the  Super Bowl, at one point linking up with Ty Dolla $ign and Anderson. Paak in a luxury suite.
