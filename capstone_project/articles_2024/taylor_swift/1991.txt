Patrick Mahomes is in party mode.
The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback was spotted back in Las Vegas Friday night, just two weeks after celebrating his team’s Super Bowl 2024 win in Sin City.
Mahomes, 28, and an entourage went to Zouk Nightclub, where the Chiefs held their official star-studded afterparty following their nail-biting victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11.
The pro athlete is in Vegas to celebrate his childhood friend Brennan McDaniel’s bachelor party, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
The fellow Texas Tech alum is reportedly marrying Mallory Moss. Mahomes’ wife, Brittany Mahomes, is attending her bachelorette party in Tulum this weekend.
On Friday evening, Patrick and his posse reportedly also dined at Carversteak at Resorts World in a private dining area called the Whiskey Room.
The NFL star reportedly splurged on a round of Don Julio 1942 tequila, which goes for $58 a shot, and accompanied it with Wagyu cheesesteak bites and crab legs.
Patrick’s teammate Travis Kelce is flying in to join the celebrations soon.
The Chiefs tight end jetted into Australia for a whirlwind 48 hours to join his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, as she performed her Eras Tour shows Down Under.
Kelce, 34, went to the Grammy winner’s first Sydney concert Friday night, where he watched the show in a VIP tent alongside other celebs, including Baz Luhrmann, Rita Ora and Katy Perry.

During the show, the pop star changed the lyric of her 2022 song “Karma,” singing, “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs,” as a sweet shoutout to the athlete.
The couple was then spotted passionately kissing after the show ended.
Despite Kelce’s brief stay, the two managed to take in some of the tourist attractions, including a visit to the Sydney Zoo, where they fed wildlife and held hands.
Swift is set to remain in Sydney for at least two more days, as she has more shows scheduled for Sunday and Monday at Accor Stadium.
