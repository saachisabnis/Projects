NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) — It looks like Taylor Swift isn't the only musician wanting to team up with Travis Kelce. The Chiefs tight end could be looking at a duet with Garth Brooks.
Brooks' new bar 'Friends in Low Places' is set to host its grand opening on March 7, and the country music legend is inviting Kelce to join the celebration on Broadway.
The invitation came after the NFL on FOX posted a TikTok of Kelce singing ‘Friends in Low Places’ at the Chiefs Super Bowl parade.
In an Inside Studio G video on Brooks’ website, the country singer was answering questions from fans. One asked if he would be at the bar's grand opening. Brooks initially said no, but changed his tune saying if Kelce will come, he’d be there.
Brooks said he was happy to send the invite out to Kelce if he wanted to sing ‘Friends in Low Place’ in Friends in Low Places.
“You want to come sing that? I’ll send the plane. You come by yourself, or bring your brother, your gang, whatever you want to do,” said Brooks. “Plane holds 11, just remember that.”
