Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may have made a hushed exit in the upscale neighborhood of Woodside, California. 
Reports from the Real Deal suggest that an entity linked to Zuckerberg has swiftly offloaded a “European-inspired estate,” raising eyebrows regarding the tech titan’s clandestine property movements.
This would mark the second California property that the social-media mogul has parted ways with in recent years.
The lavish residence, tucked away at 75 Roberta Drive, boasts a sprawling 4,800-square-foot home sprawled across a generous 3.5-acre plot. 
According to Zillow, the palatial abode, featuring four bedrooms and 3.5 baths, traded hands in a jaw-dropping $29.6 million deal on March 4, according to San Mateo County records.
Behind private gates, the home boasts a chef’s kitchen, a family room, an open living room and a dining room with access to the expansive grounds, the previous listing notes. 
There is also the option to dine al fresco while looking over the contemporary patio and outdoor features that include a pool, a hot tub and an outdoor open fireplace across “park like grounds.” 
There are also multiple electric charging stations for vehicles and a large garage.
Details surrounding the brokers who handled this transaction remain a mystery. Even Mary Gullixson, a Compass agent who previously managed the property’s listing, has said she didn’t oversee the recent sale.
Unraveling the web of ownership surrounding the property unveils a complex network of anonymous entities. 
The selling entity, known as 75 Roberta LLC, traces its management back to A7P Services, a limited liability company in Cheyenne, Wyoming, according to TRD.  
The business address of A7P Services aligns perfectly with that of A7P Trust Company Inc. Trustee, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
This isn’t the first time A7P Trust Company Inc. Trustee has surfaced in Zuckerberg’s orbit. Jack Sweeney, known for tracking billionaire Elon Musk’s movements and singer Taylor Swift via their private jets, previously pinpointed Zuckerberg’s aircraft, citing its registration code, which led straight back to A7P Trust.
Further scrutiny reveals Apercen Partners, a renowned tax consulting firm catering to tech elites, as the signatory for 75 Roberta’s company registration. Apercen’s ties to Zuckerberg and his family date back to notable transactions, including the acquisition of a $22.3 million townhouse in New York City in 2015.
Zuckerberg’s real estate escapades aren’t confined to Woodside; his property empire spans across California and Hawaii, boasting a staggering valuation of $320 million. 
In 2022, he divested from a San Francisco mansion for $31 million while retaining a residential complex in Palo Alto, occupying a half block.
Zuckerberg’s reps didn’t immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
