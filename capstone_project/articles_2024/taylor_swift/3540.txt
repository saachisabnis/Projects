Crackdown: The Eras Tour concert film starring Taylor Swift is among the shows available on Disney+
Disney has launched a crackdown on password sharing in an effort to boost sign-ups and revenue.
The media giant's chief executive Bob Iger said its streaming platform Disney+ will start taking action against freeloaders in June before a 'full rollout' in September.
Many major streaming services are hit by password sharing – where users share their log-in details with family and friends not in the same household, enabling them to access content without paying – despite it being against platform rules. 
The Eras Tour concert film starring Taylor Swift is among the shows available on Disney+ along with the Star Wars movie and drama Shogun.
Disney's decision comes after fellow streaming giant Netflix attributed a recent jump in subscribers to its own recent crackdown on password sharing.
'Netflix is the gold standard in streaming,' Iger said. 'They've done a phenomenal job.'
