If you think Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce make a great combo check this out.
Fireball Cinnamon Whisky has just released a lipstick inspired by the celebrity couple.
It's a bright red color called cinnamon delight.
Honoring Swift's preference for red lips and Kelceâ€™s preference for fireball.
This is Fireball's first foray into the lipstick biz.
Released just in time for Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce to take on the 49ers at Super Bowl Sunday.
That's where Swift is expected to be his biggest fan.
The shade sells for 13-87 in honor of the duo's favorite numbers.
And Fireball guarantees it will never go out of style.
