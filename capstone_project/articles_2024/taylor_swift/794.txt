The alleged stalker who was arrested after trying to enter Taylor Swift's apartment in New York City was busted again last night in the same place. Swift's security team reportedly called police as soon as they recognized the man, who police found around the corner when they arrived. He was again taken away in the back of a police cruiser, but it's unclear if he was charged with a crime. The NYPD previously busted him on Saturday while he was fumbling with Swift's front door. Cops found an outstanding warrant on his record for a missed court appearance in 2017 and took him into custody.
