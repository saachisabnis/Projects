According to WCAX, Professor Brian Warwick of VTSU is a music industry professional who teaches audio production.
This fall, he plans on digging in deep into the Weird Universe of Al Yankovic, his songs, lyrics, and how to craft a great parody that pays homage to the original artist.
Warwick, a native of Grafton, Massachusetts, has worked with Al before, according to vermontstate.edu.
As a matter of fact, Warwick received a Grammy for his work on Al's record, "Mandatory Fun," which won Best Comedy Album.  It was Al's first number-one album in his decades-long career.
The two consider themselves friends.
Who doesn't love a good Weird Al parody?  He has so many hits to choose from, like "Eat It," a parody of Michael Jackson's "Beat It":
How about this one, "I Love Rocky Road", to the tune of Joan Jett's "I Love Rock and Roll"?
This is Al's very first TV appearance, "Another One Rides the Bus" to the tune of "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen:
Admittedly, this one is a little tough on my ears, but you be the judge.  It's titled "My Bologna", to the tune of "My Sharona" by the Knack.
The English course on Taylor Swift offered at Harvard inspired the Weird Al one, according to WCAX.
I can only imagine how long the waiting list is to get into that class!
It's so appropriate that this Harvard course is in the English department, because it's her lyrics that get people the most.  And when I say, "people," I mean me.
I remember listening to Dr. Demento on the radio on Sunday nights at around my bedtime, maybe 9pm or so.  He played all the weird songs that no other radio show did.
Al Yankovic was one of the artists that he played regularly.
