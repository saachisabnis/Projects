TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - A missed field goal by the Buffalo Bills had Chiefs fans cheering.
“Yelling and screaming, when that ball didn’t go through that goal it was like ‘oh that’s game over, we just won.’ so ya, it was pretty loud,” said Chief’s fan Jen Urton.
“Oh my gosh it was so exciting, we were very scared but during the last play when they missed that field goal, we were so happy,” said Chiefs fan Jacquelyn Kauffman.
Sunday night’s win brought customers into Kansas Sampler on Jan. 22. 
“Everyone comes in and they try to get their gear whether they need new ones or not. From filling orders for some people to pick up to just having their last minute thing that they need to go watch,” said Kansas Sampler Store Manager Katelynn May
The Chiefs are headed to their sixth consecutive AFC Championship appearance, the streak has prepared the store well for the fans’ demands.
“Through this week it’ll start building up more and as people start to realize what we’re going to be getting in from checking online, they’ll start coming in and getting whatever they can until then. Depending on how Sunday goes, we’ll be open after the game more than likely,” said May. 
Employees say wins aren’t the only thing driving sales into a new “era” this season.
“Now we have the ‘Swiftie’ stuff going on so we’re trying to get anything that Taylor Swift wears. We have a jacket that we got first thing, I think the first game or something they had and they sold out pretty quick on that jacket and then we just got it in and we have slim pickings now,” said May.
