Travis Kelce is set to be the Super Bowl MVP — especially if he’s not on the field.
His team, the Kansas City Chiefs, is vying for a spot in the big game in Las Vegas on February 11.
Page Six hears that the Chiefs tight end has become such a pop culture phenomenon in the past year that many corporations would prefer he didn’t make it to the Super Bowl — so that he’s available to appear at the sponsored many events surrounding the football game.
Kelce’s star has been rising over the last couple of seasons anyway, but in 2023 his profile went supercharged when he started dating the world’s hottest star, Taylor Swift.
Now sources tells us that brands are secretly hoping the Chiefs crash out of the running — and are willing to pay Kelce up to $1 million to show up at bashes around Sin City.
The party scene around the Super Bowl is always big business, but with the game going down in Las Vegas this year, the marquee bashes will, much like some of the NFL players themselves, be on PEDs.
One insider told us sponsors think the way to ensure that their bash stands out from the pack would be to get Kelce — or ideally Kelce and his fellow NFL star brother, Jason — to host.
The “problem” is that one of them may be in the Super Bowl, according to the insider.
“Travis bring a lot of attention, which is good for business,” said a source.
Travis was already developing a reputation for being something of a pin-up with appeal beyond the bleachers. But he has become a household name since he was first linked to the “Shake It Off” star in July, when he attended one of the dates on her “Eras” tour.
After months of playing coy about their romance, they confirmed the dating rumors in October.
Earlier this month Page Six reported that they’re hoping to get engaged by the summer.
