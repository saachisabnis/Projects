ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Many people tuning into Sunday’s Super Bowl will be watching for more than just the plays on the field.
First there are the commercials, then the halftime show and now many will be keeping an eye on the stands looking for one particular fan - Taylor Swift.
Virginia Tech Economics Professor Jadrian Wooten joined Here @ Home to discuss Swift’s influence on the sport. He explained a recent LendingTree survey found 16 percent of U.S. shoppers admit Swift’s presence nudged them to buy football gear.
Wooten shared his perspective on the future impact Swift will have at drawing in new fans and a bigger audience to the NFL.
