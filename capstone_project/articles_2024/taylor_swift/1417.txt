In a Feb. 2 letter to the Daily Herald, Mr. Toby Tobler from East Dundee goes on a bit of a rant complaining about the social media aspect of the Kansas City Chiefs versus Baltimore Ravens game. He complains about the focus on a Chiefs players’ girlfriend Taylor Swift, calling an article about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift “disgusting.”
He goes on to call the attention to Taylor Swift a publicity stunt by the National Football League. He then accuses the Daily Herald of being a biased newspaper for covering this.
Romances with athletes and stars of the silver screen are nothing new. You need only think about Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe among many others, too many to list.
At the beginning of his letter, he asks “is it just me?” I think for the most part, it is.
We really should see past that and really enjoy some good football, which the NFL playoffs are usually all about.
