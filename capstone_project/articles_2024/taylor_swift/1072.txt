Joni Mitchell has been added to the line-up of performers at this year's Grammy Awards. Mitchell, who is nominated for Best Folk Album at the 2024 Grammys, will perform at the ceremony for the first time. She joins a list of previously announced performers that includes Travis Scott, Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, Burna Boy, Luke Combs, Billie Eilish, and Billy Joel. U2 will also appear, with a live performance recorded at the Sphere in Las Vegas.
          

            Mitchell, who was hospitalised in 2015, has been making a quiet return to public life in the subsequent years. She appeared at the Kennedy Center Awards in 2021 and introduced Brandi Carlile’s performance at the 2022 Grammys alongside Bonnie Raitt. Later that year she played a surprise set at the Newport Folk Festival. Last summer she headlined a show at Washington’s Gorge Amphitheatre.
