UPDATE 4/3 5:00 p.m. — Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice has broken his silence on the accident, apologizing for his actions.
“Today I met with Dallas PD investigators regarding Saturday’s accident. I take full responsibility for my part in this matter and will continue to cooperate with the necessary authorities,” Rice wrote in a Wednesday, April 3, Instagram Story statement. “I sincerely apologize to everyone impacted in Saturday’s accident.”
Original story continues below:
Police officers in Dallas are currently looking for Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice after a car accident.
Law enforcement officials confirmed to The Dallas Morning News on Sunday, March 31, that a car believed to be registered or leased to Rice, 23, was involved in a crash one day earlier. Police noted that the accident took place on North Central Expressway and that they are currently searching for Rice.
The Dallas Morning News also obtained a police call sheet that confirmed their search for Rice.
It is not known whether Rice will face charges. According to ESPN, the NFL star does not appear listed in Dallas County jail records as of Sunday morning.

Dallas PD told TMZ that officers had been called to a multi-vehicle accident between a driver in a Corvette and one in a Lamborghini after both vehicles were speeding in the far-left lane.
“The drivers lost control and the Lamborghini traveled onto the shoulder and hit the center median wall, causing a chain reaction collision involving four other vehicles,” the officers added. “The occupants of the Lamborghini and the Corvette all ran from the scene without stopping to determine if anyone needed medical help or providing their information. Two of the involved drivers were treated at the scene by Dallas Fire Rescue for minor injuries and two occupants of another vehicle were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. The investigation and identification of the suspects are both ongoing.”
Rice has not publicly addressed the investigation or his alleged involvement. Us Weekly has reached out for comment.
Rice was drafted by the Chiefs in 2023 in the second round. At the end of his rookie season, he helped the team clinch the Super Bowl LVIII trophy in February.
“I’m not gonna lie, it’s crazy,” Rice gushed to sportscasters after the NFL championship in Las Vegas. “I just sat in the end zone and watched the confetti fall. I wasn’t even over there with the team and it’s really surreal right now. You talk about it, but it’s really just different. Like, we on top of the world. This is crazy.”
Within his rookie year, Rice had 79 receptions during the regular season and 26 in the postseason. As he made certain catches, the stadium — including Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — would erupt in cheers.

Despite Swift, 34, becoming a fervent Chiefs Kingdom fan, Rice has played it cool when it came to the pop star hanging around with the team.
“I’ve seen her, but I didn’t go up to her like, ‘Can I get a picture?’ or nothing like that,” Rice said during a December 2023 episode of the Fubo Sports’ “Airing It Out” podcast. “Maybe if my girl was there I would be like, ‘Can we get a picture with the girls together?’ or something.”
Rice had explained that he was grateful for Kelce, 34, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes taking him under their wing — and inviting him to hang out in their inner circle.
“You know, those guys like Trav and Pat, they invite us out because they know that we are the only guys that see them every day and know and see them for who they really are not just like, ‘Bro, you’re a superstar football player!’” Rice added. “It’s just Pat and it’s just Trav.”
