Mikel Arteta has made one change to his side for tonight’s encounter against Newcastle United, with Jorginho selected from the start.
The Italian international comes into our midfield for his first start since the 3-1 win against Liverpool earlier in the month as the boss shuffles his pack from Wednesday’s 1-0 loss against Porto.
Leandro Trossard drops out on the side, with Kai Havertz pushed up front in his place. Should extra firepower be needed, Gabriel Jesus has been deemed fit enough for a place on the bench after missing the last four games.
Newcastle have made three switches to their team that drew 2-2 at home to Bournemouth last time out, with Alexander Isak returning to their team after missing recent matches through injury.
There is a change in goal with Martin Dubravka ruled out, meaning Loris Karius makes his Premier League debut for the Magpies, while Tino Livramento is preferred to Dan Burn at full-back.
Ex-Gunner Joe Willock also returns from a lengthy absence to take his place among the replacements.
Arsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Kiwior, Jorginho, Rice, Odegaard, Saka, Martinelli, Havertz.Subs: Ramsdale, Cedric, Elneny, Vieira, Smith Rowe, Nelson, Trossard, Jesus, Nketiah.
Newcastle: Karius, Livramento, Schar, Botman, Trippier, Miley, Guimaraes, Longstaff, Almiron, Gordon, Isak.Subs: Gillespie, Burn, Krafth, Lascelles, Hall, Murphy, Willock, Ritchie, Barnes.
