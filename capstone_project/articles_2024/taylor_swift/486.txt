Sources close to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are denying a Page Six report that the couple are not talking about their wedding plans. “Travis and Taylor have no plans on getting engaged this summer,” an insider told Us Weekly. “Things between them are going amazing, but they haven’t even been together for a year yet and still have so much to learn about each other.” The source admits that “a lot of their loved ones” would love to see a proposal “and some may even believe” it will happen sooner rather than later, but Swift and Kelce aren’t planning on it “anytime soon.” The Page Six report claimed its own sources are reporting that “they will get engaged on their one-year anniversary in July.”
