WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins says all the Swifties can come to WrestleMania 40.
Star tight end Travis Kelce has sparked plenty of buzz for his relationship with Taylor Swift, and his Kansas City Chiefs faced the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Known wrestling fan George Kittle, who made an appearance at WrestleMania 39, is one of the 49ers’ star players.
Speaking with Brice Butler for Sports Illustrated ahead of Super Bowl LVIII, Seth Rollins was asked to pick a winner. He was also asked whether he would invite either Kelce or Kittle to WrestleMania 40.
“I’ll tell you this right now. I love George Kittle,” Seth Rollins said. “He’s an Iowa boy. Tight end, Hawkeye, good friend. But I can’t bet against Pat Mahomes in the Super Bowl. I’m picking the Chiefs to win. But I would extend an invitation to both George and Travis, and look, we’re in Philly, so his brother [Jason] is there. We can have both the Kelces there. Why not? Let’s have a party. Bring your girl. 
“Bring all the Swifties, let’s go. I love everybody. George, he’s coming to WrestleMania anyway. He was at WrestleMania last year. He comes to all the WrestleManias. He’s coming anyway. Win, lose, or draw, George is gonna be at WrestleMania. So I’d love to have the Kelces there, man. All of them. Bring the whole crew.”
Rollins’ pick proved to be accurate, as the Chiefs emerged victorious.
