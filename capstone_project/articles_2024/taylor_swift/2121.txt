Euphoria star Hunter Schafer was arrested on Monday while at a pro-Palestine protest outside of the taping of Joe Biden’s appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers.
According to a report from Vulture, Schafer was one of 33 people arrested while protesting outside of the taping. The group was there to protest for Palestinian rights alongside the Jewish Voice for Peace group on Monday. 
Photos from the protest eventually made their way online, and showed Schafer being escorted away by police, wearing a shirt that called for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

In a statement to Deadline, the NYPD’s Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information acknowledged the arrests, saying “On Monday, February 26, 2024, at approximately 1630 hours, there was a demonstration at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in the confines of the Midtown North Precinct. The demonstration concluded at 1800 hours. A total of 30 individuals were taken into custody. Thirty individuals were issued summonses for Trespass.”
The reason for the protest occurring outside of Late Night With Seth Meyers coincided with Biden’s recent appearance on the show. The President was a surprise guest alongside Amy Poehler, and spoke briefly about a wide variety of topics, including Taylor Swift, conspiracy theories, and the Israel-Hamas war.
