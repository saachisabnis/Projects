Morgan Wallen’s “One Thing at a Time,” released in March 2023, is back at No. 1 in the latest tracking week of the Billboard 200 chart. 

	There are no new releases in the Top 10 of the list as Wallen’s 36-song set enters its 17th nonconsecutive week at No. 1 with the equivalent of 61,000 albums sold and 80 million official streams — the lowest total units for a No. 1 album since Pusha T’s “It’s Almost Dry” debuted at No. 1 with 55,000 units in 2022, Billboard notes. Drake’s “For All the Dogs” trails behind at No. 2 with 58,000 equivalent album units, while 2024’s first Billboard 200 leader — Taylor Swift’s “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” — retreats to No. 3 collecting a total of 56,00 units.

	In previous years, No. 1 albums have recurringly moved at least 100,000 units to break No. 1, but smaller unit numbers have become more common. Usually, albums with smaller unit numbers are peaking at No. 1 by the power of their impact on streaming services. Such is the case for Wallen’s set, and in October, Rod Wave’s fifth studio LP “Nostalgia” enjoyed a similar feat with 88,000 units keeping him at No. 1.

	“One Thing at a Time” spent its first 12 weeks at No. 1 through early June after it opened 501,000 sales in the U.S. nearly one year ago. The super-sized set logged a total of 498.28 million on-demand streams in its first week and became Spotify’s most-streamed country album in a single day by a male artist. 

	Back on today’s chart, Nicki Minaj’s “Pink Friday 2” is at No. 4 with 52,000 units. Slowly climbing up the chart is Noah Kahan’s “Stick Season” at No. 5, and the remainder of the Top 10 are former No. 1s: SZA’s “SOS” at No. 6; Swift’s “Midnights” at No. 7; Swift’s “Lover” at No. 8; Zach Bryan’s self-titled album is at No. 9; and Swift’s “Folklore” rounds out the peak at No. 10.
