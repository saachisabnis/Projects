The Miami Dolphins gearing up for a do-or-die Wild Card Playoff game at a freezing Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City tonight. Voice of the Fins, Jimmy Cefalo, says all eyes will be focused on Travis Kelce's box to see if girlfriend Taylor Swift is on hand. Temperatures are expected to be in the teens at kickoff, but Cefalo says all professional players are used to playing in all kinds of conditions and the cold is easier to play in than excessive heat or rain. The Chiefs are the defending champs, but Cefalo says it's not the same team as last year, quarterback Patrick Mahomes has the worst numbers of his career in almost every category. Catch all the action tonight on our sister stations-Big 105-9 and Fox Sports 940 Miami.  Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. -- our pregame coverage starts at 6 p.m.
