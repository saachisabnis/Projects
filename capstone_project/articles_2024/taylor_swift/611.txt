Today is the day for you or your daughters to take the first step to becoming a Girl Scout here in Western New York.
For 12 hours today between 8 am and 8 pm, the Girls Scouts of Western New York are holding a special "Join-A-Thon" where girls can win some great prizes and get their first patch if they join a troop.
Girls who sign up during the "Join-A-Thon" will not only be introduced to the world of Girl Scouts, but they will be entered to win one of three incredible prizes: a $200 Gift Card, a $100 Gift Card, or a $50 Gift Card. Also, every girl who signs up to join will receive an exclusive Join-a-thon patch as a memorable keepsake.
Plus if anyone is thinking about starting their own troop, they can win some starter funds. Any new troop that registers before January 31, can win $200 towards starter funds.
To qualify, a Troop must have 2 Leaders and a minimum of 10 Girls. This initiative aims to support and jumpstart new Troops on their Girl Scout adventures.
