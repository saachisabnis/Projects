He's said meeting her was “breath of relief.”

 Simu Liu is just Ken, and Allison Hsu is everything — at least, she is to him! Liu, best known for playing one of the Kens in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Shang-Chi in the Marvel franchise, has found love with Hsu, a music marketing director, and the pair could not be cuter.

 Liu began dating Hsu shortly after breaking up with fellow actor Jade Bender in 2022. After the breakup, Liu explained to Entertainment Tonight, he became “more and more comfortable with the idea of therapy and support systems.” Now, it seems that Liu couldn’t be doing better.

 Since their relationship was announced in late 2022, Liu and Hsu have been going steady, appearing on numerous red carpets and even getting away for a few vacations. In 2024, the pair brought along their dog, Chopa, to a film premiere.

 Simu Liu previously told us at InStyle that he doesn’t believe in soulmates. “I think sometimes we forget that we ourselves are changing, evolving beings, and sometimes people grow in different directions no matter how right for each other they were right at a specific moment in time," he said.

 Here’s a look back at Simu Liu and Allison Hsu’s relationship timeline. 

 In 2022, Hsu posted a snap of her and Liu in the crowd at a concert. The pair were all smiles as Liu wrapped one arm around Hsu. The caption simply read “:)”. 

 Just over a week after Hsu hard-launched the relationship on Instagram, the couple made their red carpet debut at the premiere of the Christmas horror flick Violent Night. In a very adorable turn of events, the pair wore matching garish holiday sweaters to the event.

 At the end of 2022, Liu and Hsu embarked on their first couples' vacation, setting off for Anguilla in the Caribbean. Liu posted a carousel of images to Instagram of the trip, writing “paradise” with a heart emoji.

 On December 21, 2022, the pair were seen on a more casual date night as they enjoyed a basketball game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Charlotte Hornets in Los Angeles.

 By the end of the year, things seemed to have become a little more serious for the couple. In an Instagram post, Hsu revealed that she and Liu spent the Christmas holidays together with her family in Taiwan. “Brought him home,” she wrote. 

 As Liu explained to People, he had been a little nervous to meet the parents. "Yeah, doing the whole family thing and meeting the parents thing, which no matter who you are and where you come from or anything like that, is a stressful time," he said.

 In 2023, Liu mentioned his girlfriend during a red carpet interview at the Met Gala. While speaking to InStyle, he revealed that his phone background picture featured him and Hsu. “Shoutout to Allison if she’s around, if she’s watching InStyle,” he said. 

 When asked if he had a message for Hsu, he replied, “I love you, obviously.”

 When Liu starred as Ken (well, one of the Kens) in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, he brought Hsu as his date to the premiere. At the premiere, Liu opened up to People about how they found time for each other amidst their busy careers.

 "We've got a packed summer," he said. "I mean, [the] schedule's always packed and it's always, you know, it's just hard for anybody who travels a lot to fight for time together and make sure you're taking enough time to be present with each other and to kind of block out everything that everybody wants and to just kind of be, to have a moment that’s just ours."

 He went on to say that he and Hsu were planning on taking a few trips together somewhere “warm and sunny” in the months to come. 

 In August, Liu took to Instagram to share a sweet message in honor of Hsu’s birthday.

 “happy birthday to the girl who truly does it all,” he wrote. “she inspires me in her passion for music (well… one musician specifically), teaches me how to balance a busy and chaotic schedule with grace, and touches me in how she cares for each and every person in her life. most importantly, she shows me that the people we love are always worth fighting for.”

 He went on, “i love you to pieces babe. whether we’re on another crazy trip to god-knows-where for who-knows-what, or just binging our way through friends at home, there’s simply nothing better than holding your hand. thanks for never giving up on me.”

 Couples who advertise together, stay together. In August, the pair collaborated on a Tiffany & Co. ad campaign. “home is where you are,” wrote Liu in the caption of an Instagram post featuring an image from the partnership.

 Liu opened up once again about his relationship with Hsu in August 2023 when he revealed to People while at the Cadillac Dealership in New York City that meeting her had been life changing. "I think she really just has taught me the value in so many things,” he said. “She's absolutely changed my life, so I'm very, very grateful to have her.

 He continued, "She's really taught me that you have to fight for the time with the people that you love, she's really taught me that you need to be intentional and tend to each and every one of the relationships that matter to you."

 A couple of months later, Liu once again gushed about his relationship with Hsu. "I think everyone knows the feeling of being in a situation where they're not fully happy, and then all of a sudden for that to change... it's such a breath of relief," he told People. 

 As he explained, their relationship had opened his eyes to what a healthy love could look like. "It's this feeling of, 'Oh, right, it does exist.' You start to feel like, okay, maybe I've just been conditioned to want something that doesn't exist or I have unrealistic expectations," he said.

 He added that their relationship was all about mutual support. "We've been tremendously happy. I feel challenged and loved and cared for, and I feel championed,” he said. “I think the best, healthiest relationships are ones where you have each other's back, and I definitely feel like that's the case."

 Liu continued to gush about Hsu on social media in 2024. On Valentine’s Day, he posted an adorable photo of the couple at the 2024 Super Bowl. “happy valentines darling 🤍 id fly in from tokyo for your super bowl any day ;),” he wrote in a coded reference to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

 In February 2024, the couple appeared at the premiere of Arthur the King, Liu’s latest film, which followed a “scrappy street dog." In an unusual turn of events, the pair decided to bring their dog, Chopa, along with them in a nod to the plot of the film.

 In March, the couple attended their second Academy Awards ceremony together. Liu wore an all-black Fendi suit. Hsu coordinated with her boyfriend, opting for a brilliant white structured gown with an elegant top knot.
