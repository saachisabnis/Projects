Speculations regarding the whereabouts of Princess Kate Middleton have been rampant in recent weeks, fueling a wave of conspiracy theories following her abdominal surgery in January.
Kensington Palace, however, has stepped forward to address the concerns, reaffirming the princess's well-being and dismissing social media speculations.
In a statement exclusively given to Page Six, a representative from Kensington Palace reiterated the palace's stance established in January.
"Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess' recovery and we'd only be providing significant updates. That guidance stands," the rep said. They also gave a similar response to HuffPost.
The palace emphasized that Middleton, aged 42, is "doing well" amidst her recovery.
The mystery surrounding Middleton's absence has deepened as she has not been spotted in public since Christmas Day, where she attended church alongside members of the royal family.
With minimal information available about her medical procedure, speculation has run rampant, spanning a wide range of theories-from plastic surgery to conjectures of her being in a coma, and even suggestions of her death.
These speculations have taken a lighter turn in certain corners, particularly on X, formerly Twitter, where humorous discussions, jokes, and memes have emerged alongside the speculation.
This coincided with other trending discussions on the platform, including the 'Willy Wonka Experience' in Glasgow, where displeased families contacted the authorities to voice their grievances about the event
"Continuously scrolling through the most bizarre and hilarious tweets about Kate Middleton and the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience realizing we've given this app new life again," an X user posted.
"If your feed isn't about Kate Middleton, the Glasgow Willy Wonka disaster and/or trying to figure out who yelled at Rebecca Ferguson, you're doing it wrong [and] missing out," another one said.
"'Yeh so basically Kate Middleton hasn't been seen in months like she's actually missing. [W]ord on the conspiracy street is that she's doing [one] of many things - gone for a BBL, growing out her bangs, lost at the Wonka experience. [A]lso she's possibly [B]anksy x,'" a social media user posted, accompanied by a GIF featuring the meme of Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift appearing to gossip.
Initially, Kensington Palace confirmed Middleton's surgery on January 16, stating that she would remain hospitalized for up to two weeks and wouldn't resume public duties until around Easter.
Following her hospitalization, Middleton returned home to Windsor to continue her recovery, according to a statement released on January 29. Although the palace has not disclosed Middleton's official diagnosis, it has stated that it is not thought to be cancer-related.

Meanwhile, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has been carrying out his public duties while Middleton recuperates.
The Prince of Wales made a public appearance on Thursday at a London synagogue, where he addressed concerns about the rise of antisemitism, stating, "Both Catherine and I are extremely concerned about the rise of antisemitism."
Last month, he also attended the 2024 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards, where he expressed his regret over the absence of his wife.
"I am sorry Catherine's not here, she does love the BAFTAs," he said, as per the reports.
However, he raised eyebrows when he withdrew from a royal engagement on Tuesday citing undisclosed "personal reasons."
He opted out of attending a planned memorial service at St. George's Chapel in Windsor for his godfather, King Constantine of the Hellenes, who passed away in January 2023.
William's nonattendance at the memorial, along with the palace's explanation has only fueled further speculation regarding the Princess of Wales' health.
Nevertheless, the palace restated that the princess's condition remains positive.
Coinciding with Middleton's surgery, King Charles III announced he would undergo a routine procedure on his prostate, later revealed to be due to cancer.
Expressing gratitude for the support received, King Charles stated, "Such kind thoughts are the greatest comfort and encouragement." Despite his health concerns, the king has since resumed his duties.
The news of Middleton's health comes during a turbulent period for the royal family. King Charles's cancer diagnosis has led to a schedule of regular treatments, prompting him to postpone public-facing duties while still carrying out state business and official paperwork.
Additionally, Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, has recently been diagnosed with malignant skin cancer, discovered during treatment for breast cancer.
Amid swirling speculations, Kensington Palace's reaffirmation of Middleton's well-being offers a glimpse of clarity: she is recuperating at home, easing uncertainties surrounding her absence from public view.
