Weekday Mornings on 102.5 KNIX! Call us, 833-577-KNIX (5649)
This morning we drafted "Best Female Villain" for our Monday Morning Draft. We had some great picks, and could have picked many more, and know we forgot some. We also this morning talked about the big news from the weekend in country music... Morgan's first comments about his recent arrest, and Luke Bryan's big fall on stage. We also broke down the impact of Taylor Swift's new record, it was talked about by everyone over the weekend, you could not escape the record. Brooke even admitted publicly that she was wrong about something involving Taylor!
