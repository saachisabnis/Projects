Taylor Swift's latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," has shattered the record for the most-streamed album on Spotify in a single day.
The singer's eagerly awaited album dropped on Friday, thrilling Swifties fans worldwide.
The album features 31 tracks in which Swift candidly expresses her heartache while also channeling her anger toward former lovers.
The first 16 tracks were released at midnight and a few hours later, an additional 15 tracks were released, giving fans plenty to sift through.
Swift revealed the album was an anthology of new works reflecting "events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time â€” one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure," the BBC noted.
"The chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed," she said.
"Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it," Swift added.
The album comes after the widely successful "Midnights," which sold 1.6 million copies in its debut week in the U.S. two years ago.
The new double album has sparked renewed fervor among Swift's devoted fanbase. The arrival of fresh material is likely to electrify the the star's blockbuster Eras tour, which is hitting Europe this summer.
