If Travis Kelce was planning on supporting Taylor Swift in Australia, he hasn’t headed Down Under just yet.
The 14-time Grammy winner, who is currently on the Aussie leg of her blockbuster Eras Tour, performed three sold out shows to more than 288,000 people in Melbourne over the weekend. 
Meanwhile, the three time Super Bowl champ stepped out in Kansas City for lunch with a pal, according to snaps obtained by the Daily Mail. 
In the photos, the NFL player, 34, grabbed a bite at a local eatery, Rye, before jumping in his Rolls Royce and rolling the windows down. 
Kelce smiled and waved to fans on the street who noticed him, Daily Mail reported, while rocking a camouflage sweatsuit and chunky black sneakers during the outing Saturday. 
The tight end paired the laid back look with a black cap, and sported a longer-than-usual beard. 
The outing comes a few days after he hinted at the possibility of heading to Australia on his New Heights podcast. 
During this week’s episode, he cryptically told listeners that he would “venture to an island real soon,” leading fans to theorize that he would join his girlfriend for her Sydney tour dates next weekend, before traveling to Singapore in early March. 
Since arriving on the other side of the world, Swift has made headlines for discussing her upcoming album, “The Tortured Poets Department” on stage, and performing multiple medleys of fan favorite hits, including “Getaway Car,” “August” and “The Other Side of the Door.” 
“Melbourne, what do I even say to you after over 288,000 of you came and danced with us in the last 3 nights ??! That was unforgettable. You were on an another LEVEL. Thank you for the memories. I’ll revisit the ones from this weekend often 🥲🫶,” Swift captioned a series of Instagram snaps on Sunday that showed her on stage at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
The “Cruel Summer” hitmaker, 34, also admitted to being “lonely” while writing her 2020 album, “Folklore,” despite being in a relationship with her then-long term boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.
“[I was] imagining that, instead of being a lonely millennial woman covered in cat hair drinking my weight in white wine, I was a ghostly Victorian lady wandering through the woods with a candle in a candlestick holder, and I wrote only on parchment with a feathered quill,” she was heard saying in a clip posted by a fan from her second Melbourne show.

“That was in my mind, what I thought I looked like writing ‘Folklore,'” she went on.
“That is not what I looked like … So that’s all that matters — the delusion.”
She and Alwyn started dating in 2016 and were notoriously private throughout the course of their six-year relationship. 
“I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids,” she said in her 2020 interview with Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone.
“Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy.”
After their split in early 2023, she was briefly linked to The 1975 rocker Matty Healy before she began dating Kelce in the summer. 
The new couple went public with their romance that September and haven’t been shy about flaunting their love in the months since.
Most recently, Swift supported her beau throughout the NFL season, and was on hand for his Super Bowl 2024 victory against the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month.
