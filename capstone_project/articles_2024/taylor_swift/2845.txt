Travis Kelce has become one of the faces of the NFL and a global star over the last year, thanks in large part due to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Now, he's potentially in line to host a television game show on Amazon Prime Video. 
Variety reports that Kelce is in discussions to host "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?" in a celebrity-focused reboot of the show Jeff Foxworthy used to lead.

According to Variety, "The deal, if signed, would represent the football great’s latest move toward general entertainment after appearances on “Saturday Night Live,” the reality series “Catching Kelce” and a podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason."
Kelce already plans to open a Kansas City steakhouse with Patrick Mahomes and now he is expanding his potential ventures into entertainment as well. 
While the original version of the show used children as guests to help contestants, this reboot would reportedly use celebrities instead. Kelce would fit right at home, and he's been beloved in his previous media ventures. 
We don't know how long we'll get to watch Kelce on the field, though I'm glad to see we'll likely be able to keep watching him even when his playing days are over.
