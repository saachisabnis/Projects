Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the NFL. Each week, we send out questions to the most plugged-in Kansas City Chiefs fans.  You can see all of the recent survey results here.
And be sure to check out DraftKings Sportsbook, the official sportsbook partner of SB Nation.
Since five of the other six AFC playoff teams carried a fullback in 2023, we wondered if Chiefs fans wanted fullback whisperer Andy Reid to get one for 2024.  Guess not.
We can argue all day about whether offense or defense is more important in today’s NFL.  But we wondered whether Kansas City fans preferred watching a great defense over watching a great offense.  We expected most fans to vote for offense — but were surprised by how many voted for defense.
Forget about the betting line.  Most NFL fans think the Chiefs are about to win back-to-back NFL championships.
Naturally, that means Kansas City’s quarterback would be the most likely recipient of his third Super Bowl MVP award.
NFL fans prefer betting on the Super Bowl coin toss over some other common prop bets.  And why not?  The odds are pretty easy to figure.
Whether NFL fans like it or not, Ms. Swift is likely to be at Sunday’s game.  And who knows?  Maybe she’ll be a fixture at Chiefs’ games for years to come.
