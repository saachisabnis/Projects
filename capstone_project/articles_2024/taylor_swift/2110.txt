Jesse Baird, 26, and his boyfriend Luke Davies, 29, were a picture of young love. They shared joyful snaps on Instagram, including one at a Pink concert, grinning and waiting for the pop star to appear.
But their lives took a tragic turn when they were found dead, their bodies stuffed into surfboard bags and buried in a remote farmland two hours from their home in Sydney, Australia.
Shockingly, the man accused of their murder is Beau Lamarre-Condon, a former celebrity blogger and local police officer. He allegedly used his Glock service pistol as the murder weapon.
His colleagues were puzzled by his lavish lifestyle, which seemed out of sync with his Â£40,000 salary as a police constable.

Now, he's been charged with the horrific crime, with unrequited love believed to be the motive. Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty revealed that there had been some sort of relationship between Lamarre and Baird, but it did not "end well."
Corey-Dean Thorpe, a friend and former partner of Baird, has shared that he helped Baird write a text to Lamarre. The message said: "I would appreciate it if you could refrain from contacting me."
People, both friends and strangers, came to Baird's rented house in the fashionable area of Paddington in Sydney to leave flowers. One card read 'RIP'. Another said, "I still grieve for your loss."
Luke Davies was a happy member of the cabin crew for Australian airline Qantas, while Baird lived a more public life.

After graduating in drama and media, he left his hometown of Melbourne in 2017 to chase a career in TV. He chose to live in Sydney, where he became a travelling reporter for the popular TV station Channel 10.
Baird was also known as an 'Aussie Rules' football umpire, set to referee a pre-season practice match on February 20.
Sadly, he was killed just one day before. Friends have been quick to say that they don't think Baird and Lamarre were involved.
"(Lamarre) was not his ex-boyfriend," one of Baird's friends, TV producer Isaac Muller, told an Australian TV show. "They were never going out."
