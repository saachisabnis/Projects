Theater operators hope the science fiction sequel’s star power and epic visuals will draw viewers away from streaming—and persuade them to see more in-person films.

Since the beginning of the year, the business of cinemas has been a shell of what it was 12 months ago, when the blockbuster releases of Avatar: The Way of Water and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania generated billions of dollars at the global box office. Although films with relatively modest budgets such as   Paramount Pictures’  Mean Girls and Bob Marley: One Love have recently outperformed expectations, it’s mostly been a desert for big-budget megahits in 2024. Enter   Dune: Part Two, the swashbuckling-in-the-sand sequel opening on March 1 that cinema owners are hoping will jolt the box office back into gear.
“Everywhere I go, everyone’s always asking me, ‘When’s Dune opening? When’s Dune opening?’ We really need that first blockbuster to start the year, as blockbusters fuel ticket sales for other movies, and I think Dune 2 is going to be it for us,” says Bob Bagby, chairman of the   National Association of Theatre Owners and chief executive officer of the 100-year-old   B&B Theatres chain. B&B’s ticket presales for the sequel are the best since the  Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert movie, released in October, Bagby says.
