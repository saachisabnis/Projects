NEW YORK CITY (WCBS) - A man was arrested after trying to enter Taylor Swift’s apartment building in New York, according to police.
Police in New York City responded to a reported incident at Taylor Swift’s apartment building in Tribeca.
Police say the man tried opening a door to the building.
This is not the first time someone has tried to get into Swift’s home. Nearly two years ago, a 52-year-old man was arrested on trespassing charges there, and in 2018, another man got inside and took a nap.
