We've seen this a lot with Taylor Swift going to watch Travis Kelce at Kansas City Chiefs games.
She's cleaned up suites she's been in, and she's generously tipped stadium workers in the past.
That was apparently the case according to Jerris Rainey. She's a worker at Highmark Stadium who had this to say to 7News WKBW in Buffalo after the game: "She's a sweetie pie. Very down to earth. I just wanted to just see her, and she you know she stopped, and she asked me if I worked at the stadium. I said yes. And she asked if she could give me a tip. And she gave me $100 and then she asked if I wanted to take a picture with her and I said yes."
That's just lovely!
