U2 recently dropped another new remix of “Atomic City” by DJ/Producer David Guetta.
This is the second “Atomic City” remix U2 has released. The first, from producer Mike WiLL Made-It, dropped in December.
U2 had earlier shared a performance of their “Atomic City” during the Grammy Awards on Sunday.
The Grammy performance marked the first televised broadcast from the new state-of-the-art venue the Sphere, where U2 is currently headlining their 40-show residency, “U2: UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere.”
After the performance, the band participated in an award presentation, announcing that the winner for Best Pop Vocal Album was Taylor Swift for Midnights.
“Atomic City” was released as a single on September 29, 2023 through Island Records.  It was produced by Jacknife Lee and Steve Lillywhite and was recorded at Sound City Studios. 
The song was written as a promotional tie-in to the band’s “U2: UV Achtung Baby”  residency at the Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley, and it was released the same day the residency began.
