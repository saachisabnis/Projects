Australian police confirmed on Tuesday that no charges will be filed against Taylor Swift's father, Scott Swift, despite a photographer's complaint that Swift's father attacked him during a paparazzi encounter last month.
New South Wales Police Force confirmed to TMZ that officers attached to North Shore Police Area Command have launched an investigation following a report of an assault at Neutral Bay Wharf at about 2:30 am on Tuesday, February 27, 2024.
Photographer Ben McDonald filed a complaint on February 26, claiming that Scott had touched him inappropriately after the Swifts' group disembarked from a yacht. At the time, the superstar was in the country for 'Eras Tour' performances in Sydney and Melbourne.
According to the photographer's account in the Daily Mail, McDonald insisted that an umbrella be placed in his face to stop him from taking pictures, and Scott went one step further by "charging" at him.
Police said that they were called to look into an alleged assault after a 71-year-old man allegedly attacked a 51-year-old man at Neutral Bay Wharf. The younger man reported the incident, and investigations are underway by the officers attached to North Shore Police Area Command.
However, the man did not require medical treatment.
At the time, the singer's representative said that the two were aggressively pushing themselves toward Swift, holding at her security staff and threatening to toss the female staff member into the water.
The probe yielded insufficient evidence for further investigation, and no other details were disclosed.
