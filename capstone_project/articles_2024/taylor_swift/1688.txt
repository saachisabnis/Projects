There was a tragic shooting that happened this week during the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl Parade where over 20 people were injured and one person died.
Lisa Lopez-Galvan, 43-year old local radio host, sadly was killed at the parade on Wednesday and a GoFundMe was created with a goal of $75,000. Currently the GoFundMe has surpassed their goal amount as it's at $260,000 and Taylor Swift actually donated a huge amount. Swift, who is dating Kansas City Chief tight end Travis Kelce, donated $100,000 to the family and wrote:
According to CBS, one of Swift's representative confirmed the donation. Love Taylor Swift for doing this and our prayers go out to everyone affected by the tragic shooting. â™¥
