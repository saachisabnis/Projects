After a TikTok went viral with commenters calling Brittany Mahomes rude, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is addressing the controversy with a not-so-subtle message for her haters.
“I take rumors as a compliment. The fact that you’re bringing my name onto tables I don’t sit at shows your obsession,” read a quote shared by the 28-year-old mother of two in a recent Instagram Story. “Stay bothered.”
The quote came just days after social media users started calling her out for seemingly being impolite to a Baltimore Ravens’ stadium employee following the Kansas City Chief’s victory over the Ravens on January 28, 2024. The incident in question was captured in a TikTok video posted on CBS on NFL’s account, where Brittany can be seen asking the employee for assistance in finding her way out of the stadium. “Where do we go from here?” she asked. However, some viewers interpreted her “finger twirl” gesture as rude, sparking criticism for her treatment of the employee.

“It’s the where do we go from here with the finger twirl for me😳,” one commenter remarked, while others accused her of being “rude.” Another commenter claimed, “Mahomes wife needs to get up off her high horse. However, supportive voices also emerged, with one user expressing their understanding of the situation. “I don’t get the hate,” they wrote. “I would ask the same question if I didn’t know🤷🏾‍♀️.” Another chimed in, “Not a Mahomes celebrity fan, but wife did nothing rude in the video. She simple asked a question. Much ado about nothing.”
This isn’t the first time Brittany has faced online scrutiny. As the wife of one of the NFL’s biggest stars, she has become a target for social media trolls. In December 2023, she addressed the rising negativity on her accounts on social media, slamming “rude” individuals and urging them to “go back to where you came from.” She wrote, “Recently there has been ALOT more rude ass people on here, waaaay more then[sic] normal,” she wrote in an Instagram story at the time. 
Earlier in August 2023, she also addressed the issue of online hate head-on during a Q&A session on Instagram, stating that negative opinions no longer bother her. Responding to a follower’s question about the impact of online negativity, she shared, “It used to [bother me], yes. But not anymore. I could give two s—s about people’s opinion of me that don’t even know me,” concluding her response with a peace sign emoji.

 









During Sunday’s game, Brittany, who was joined by Taylor Swift and Keleigh Teller, enjoyed the Kansas City Chiefs’ victory from a suite at M&T Bank Stadium. The trio celebrated with their significant others on the field after the Chiefs defeated the Ravens 17-10. Brittany went on to share the celebration with fans in an Instagram post, which also showcased her game day outfit—a black-and-white trench coat adorned with red patches spelling out “Mahomes” and the number “15.”
“PROUD❤️,” she wrote in another carousel post, which featured a series of photos alongside her husband Patrick Mahomes on and off the field.
