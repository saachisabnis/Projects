Taylor Swift didn’t make it out to the iHeartRadio Music Awards yesterday evening, but the singer accepted its Artist of the Year award from afar in a pre-recorded message. In it, the singer thanked her fans and teased that “we have so many exciting things ahead of us,” including her upcoming album, The Tortured Poets Department, out April 19.
“I’m so proud of it,” she said. “I cannot wait to share it with you.”
Last night marks Swift’s first major public appearance since she went on break following her Australia and Singapore Eras tour shows. Swift will resume her tour on May 9 in Paris, where she’ll kick off her European leg.
In her appearance last night, Swift kept her outfit simple, wearing a form-fitting blue top with gold jewelry. Read and watch her full speech below:
