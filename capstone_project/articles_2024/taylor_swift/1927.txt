Look what the internet made Emma Stone do. 
The Poor Things star, who has garnered multiple accolades for her performance this award season, recently confirmed she's going to be avoiding more Taylor Swift punchlines after some apparently took offense to an obvious joke she made about her famous friend at the 2024 Golden Globes. 
"I definitely won’t make a joke like that again," she tells Variety, “because I saw headlines that really pulled it out of context." Pointing to herself, Stone adds, "What a dope."
The joke in question came after Swift applauded Stone as the latter won at the Golden Globes in January. When asked in the backstage press room about her friend's obvious support of her, Stone jokingly quipped, "What an a**hole, am I right?"
Stone continued more seriously, "I've known her for almost 20 years. I was very happy she was there and she was also nominated tonight, which was wonderful... Yes, what an a**hole."
The movie star is next expected at the 2024 SAG Awards, where she's earned her seventh nomination, this time for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Stone has won three times before, in 2012, 2015 and 2017. 
Meanwhile, her longtime friend, Swift, will be very far away from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles as she continues her Eras Tour in Sydney, Australia. 
The 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards is on Saturday, Feb. 24, at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET and is streaming live on Netflix from the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles. Follow along at ETonline.com for full coverage from the awards show, including red carpet arrivals, winners and more.
