LAS VEGAS (Gray News) – Adele is team Taylor Swift.
At her residency show in Las Vegas on Saturday, Adele told the crowd that she was rooting for the Kansas City Chiefs to win the Super Bowl.
“I think I want the Chiefs to win just because Taylor Swift goes for them,” she said as the crowd cheered.
The singer continued, “And all of you complaining about Taylor being at the game, get a f***ing life, that’s her f***ing boyfriend,” referring to Travis Kelce.
Adele admitted that she doesn’t know much about football, but she has enjoyed following Swift’s journey with the NFL.
“It’s actually made it a bit more enjoyable to watch, because like I said I have no idea what’s going on,” she said.
Adele’s wishes came true the following night when the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, beating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime 25-22.
