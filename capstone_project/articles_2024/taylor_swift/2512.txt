Latest news on Fox News, an American conservative television channel based in New York City. It was founded in 1996 by Rupert Murdoch and is owned by Fox News Media, which is itself owned by the Fox Corporation. Fox News is the most-watched cable network in the U.S.
Dominion Voting Systems has filed two defamation lawsuits against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp in Delaware Superior Court, alleging that the network amplified false claims that Dominion voting machines were used to rig the 2020 election against Donald Trump. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages and must prove that the network acted with malice by knowingly spreading false information. Emails and statements from Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox executives show that the claims made about Dominion on-air were false. Fox News has disputed Dominion's claims and maintained that comments made on the network were not defamatory, arguing they're covered under the First Amendment and the network and its anchors were reporting on matters of public importance.
