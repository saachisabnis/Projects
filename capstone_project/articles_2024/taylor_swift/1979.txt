French Montana has revealed that he stopped his plans to “buy the block” when Nipsey Hussle was murdered.
That’s the revelation the Coke Boys leader made in an interview with The Breakfast Club, which dropped on Friday (February 23). French referred to “buy[ing] the block” in his new song “Dirty Bronx Intro,” where he also references the murder of the late Coke Boy Chinx, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2015.

“I feel like watching that video with Nip was one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever seen in my life,” he said, referring to Nip’s murder outside of a clothing store he owned. “All he was trying to do was just try to change his neighborhood and just bring some great things back and try to buy his block. I feel like watching that scared me away from trying to do the same thing.”
He continued: “Look what happened to Chinx. Chinx got shot in Queens. Look what happened to a lot of people that don’t have a name, a lot of fallen soldiers. So why come back and do that?”

In a separate interview on the same day, the Moroccan-American MC defended the decision to release an extended edition of his latest effort Mac & Cheese 5  featuring six versions of each song; explicit, sped up, slowed down,  instrumental, acapella, and clean.
Speaking to TMZ, French ensured fans the six-hour project was “simple science” inspired by Taylor Swift — who, after recreating her old work, saw a boom in sales.

The MC5 rapper also credited City Girls’ JT for making her smash hit “Sideways” accessible in multiple formats.
However, the move perplexed fans, with some poking fun at the direction. “I guess French didn’t see this,” wrote one X user, sharing a screenshot of the total number of songs on the project.

“This looks like a cry for help! Like damn you must really need streams,” a second user commented. “How this even possible Man,” a third fan questioned the rapper.
Despite the jokes made at his expense, the project boasts a series of impressive collaborations with, among others, Kanye West.

Ye’s first appearance on the mixtape is on a song called “Stand United” alongside Buju Banton and SAINt JHN. The track hears him go back and forth with French Montana over production from Dem Jointz and Ye himself.
“I done been in the game 20 years and that’s on Donda,” Kanye raps in the verse, with French responding in the next line: “I done been in the game 15 years, please remind ’em.”
