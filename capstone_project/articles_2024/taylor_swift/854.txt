Taylor Swift and Kylie Kelce do not have beef. That was abundantly clear on Sunday night in Buffalo.
Kylie, of course, is the wife of Jason Kelce. Taylor is dating Jason’s brother, Travis Kelce.
You know this by now.
Earlier this month, multiple different reports alluded to some drama between the two parties. One particular ‘Exclusive‘ from Life & Style was the main catalyst for the chatter.
It said that a “brewing family feud was causing trouble” in Swift’s relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. The anonymous source said that Taylor’s friends thought that Jason and Kylie were jealous of Taylor and how much attention she was/is receiving.
Taylor hasn’t had the best reception from Jason and his wife.
There was also the whole “cup of tea” thing, which was much ado about nothing.
Kylie said in an interview that being in the spotlight or in front of a camera is “not particularly her cup of tea.” She prefers to sit in the crowd among the people instead of in a suite.
People immediately took that as a dig at Taylor. Life & Style’s source claimed that Taylor took it as a dig at Taylor!
Taylor took that personally and since then it’s been very awkward.
Kylie later set the record straight about her quote, which was taken out of context and became something that it was/is not. It had nothing to do with the world’s biggest pop star.

Even though Kylie ironed things out, the conversation about a “beef” between her and TSwizzle continued. And for some reason, it just kept getting louder and louder.
All of the reports were proved false on Sunday night as the Chiefs beat the Bills at Highmark Stadium to advance to the AFC Championship. Jason and Kylie were at the game. As was Taylor.
(Same with Cara Delevingne and three-time Grey Cup champion Zach Collaros, among others.)

Believe it or not, Taylor and Kylie were able to be in the same room at the same time. GASP!
There is no dispute between them, as was clear in a photo posted by Brittany Mahomes:

Travis’ best friend Aric Jones also posted a photo with Taylor and Kylie.

Nobody was held at gunpoint for either photo. Both Travis’ girlfriend and Jason’s wife were willing participants in both instances.
