The Berkshires #1 for New Country
Luke Combs, Kenny Chesney and Morgan Wallen are among several country artists who are launching tours in April of 2024. Based on the scope of these shows, it's safe to say things are heating up in the world of country concerts this year.
Although the schedule feels light for April — at least compared to February's list, which featured 15 tours - a quick scan reveals some heavy hitters in the genre. Combs, Chesney, Wallen and Bryan are some of the biggest names in country music.
Earlier this year, experts at Planet7Casino compiled a list of the most popular concert tickets for all genres in 2024. These shows are the most difficult for fans to get tickets to, simply because they are the tickets most people are searching for online. Although Taylor Swift was firmly seated at the top of the list, with 35 percent of Americans looking for tickets, Wallen came in at No. 2.
