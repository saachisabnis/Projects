Travis Kelce arrived in Singapore yesterday to support his girlfriend Taylor Swift during her final two Eras Tour shows in Asia. Although Kelce has yet to be photographed in the country, his friends posted pictures and videos of their arrival on social media. The group flew from Cleveland to Dubai before making the final journey to Singapore.
They are believed to be staying at the Marina Bay Sands resort, while Swift is reportedly staying in the $14,000-per-night Colonial Manor at the Capella resort. Kelce confirmed his trip to Singapore, with a journalist quoting him as saying, "For all the Swifties, Travis Kelce is headed to Singapore." This latest demonstrates Kelce's dedication to supporting his girlfriend throughout her international tour. He also traveled to Australia and South America to see her.
