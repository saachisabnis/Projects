Sofia Vergara attends the ‘Griselda’ premiere at Callao Cinema on January 09, 2024 in Madrid, Spain.
Sofia Vergara is ready to put herself out there in the dating world. After announcing her split from Joe Manganiello after seven years of marriage, the Griselda star then dated a doctor. She and Dr. Justin Saliman dated briefly last fall, and were spotted out together several times. While appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night (January 16) to promote her new series, the actress revealed her plans to spend more time in New York City to open up her dating pool. The 51-year-old Modern Family alum tells the host that the Big Apple offers "more options with men."
Even though she does not like the cold, Vergara finds it enticing that there are more than actors, writers, and directors, so she will stay for the energy and exciting people. She adds that "great food" options in the city are a plus for going out on dates, making it a better place to be as a newly single woman. As we previously reported, Vergara described 2023 as “interesting” and “difficult.” Despite that, she is excited for 2024. Besides her new Netflix series, the actress teased that there are "a lot of projects" coming this year.
During a recent interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Vergara said she has been "moving on." She added that the press surrounding her divorce from the Magic Mike star was very "respectful" and "nice." Afraid of rumors spreading like they "usually" do, Vergara was surprised they stuck to covering the facts "and that was it." She and Manganiello released a joint statement over the summer announcing their plans to divorce. It read in part: "As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives." The couple began dating in 2014 and got engaged six months later. They tied the knot on November 22, 2015. Manganiello has also been dating following their split, seeing Winning Time actress Caitlin O'Connor since September.
Griselda streams on Netflix on January 25.
2023 has seen a lot of celebrity deaths -- and deaths in love due to breakups. Some couples have called it quits after years of being together. New relationships formed that looked as though they were meant for each other.
We've all wished for some relationships to have stayed together, despite not knowing what goes on behind closed doors. Celebrities are a prime example of not knowing what they are like in real life versus the facade of a perfect relationship they put out there.
Sometimes, fans are more upset than the celebrities who are going through the breakup! When Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn called it quits after 5 years together and a rumored secret marriage, fans professed they gave up on love entirely. Others used the breakups as a way to bash celebrities. Ariana Grande's divorce announcement to Dalton Gomez caused viral videos of her alleged years of cheating on partners. As for the couples who share children together, our hearts broke for the ones we thought were happily ever afters.
Take a look below at all the major celebrity relationships that have come to an end in 2023.
