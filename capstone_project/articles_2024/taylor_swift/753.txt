Is it over now? If by “it,” you mean the NFL season, then we have news for you: Live from Highmark Stadium, the Buffalo Bills host the Kansas City Chiefs live later today on CBS, Paramount+, and NFL+.
Will the Chiefs advance yet again and leave fans and Swifties everywhere jumping for joy? Last week, Patrick Mahomes and crew put up 26 points on the road in a dominant victory over the Miami Dolphins, who were held to just a single touchdown. Mahomes completed 23 of 41 passes for 262 yards and a touchdown in the win, but can the star quarterback do the same against a Buffalo defense that remains strong despite several injuries?
Josh Allen and company finished the year with a 11-6 record, winning the AFC East for a fourth consecutive season. This is the third season in a row that the Bills have reached the divisional round, however, after Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest on the field last year, the team was knocked out of the Super Bowl race by the Cincinnati Bengals in a 27-10 defeat. Will Sean McDermott’s squad finally advance to the AFC Championship Game? We’re about to find out.
Here’s where to watch tonight’s Chiefs/Bills game online.
Tonight’s Chiefs/Bills game is set to start at 6:30 p.m. ET on CBS.
There has been no official comment from either the Swift or Kelce camp as of this article’s publish time, but we’re going to say that the chances are strong that Taylor is going to be standing by her man in Buffalo today. She withstood temperatures in the single digits last week to swag surf with Chiefs Nation in Kansas City, and she’ll be doing the same thing today in the chilly environs of Highmark Stadium  — we think.
The Bills-Chiefs game is available to stream on Paramount+, which is the official platform for CBS.
You can also stream today’s Chiefs-Bills game with an active subscription to Sling TV, fuboTV, Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Stream, NFL+, or YouTube TV.
FuboTV and YouTube TV offer free trials for new subscribers.
For sure. Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV subscribers can watch any NFL playoff game airing on FOX, ESPN, CBS, or NBC.
