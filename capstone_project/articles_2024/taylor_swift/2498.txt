Taylor Swift's Eras Tour will come to a halt in 2024 after her final show in Singapore, but she'll be plenty busy as the tour takes a break.
She's got her next album, The Tortured Poets Department dropping in April, which could mean lots of interviews and promotions. And then? She's back on the road with more international dates.
So if you're here, you could be wondering: when will the Eras Tour be back?
The answer! Taylor Swift and Co. will be back on May 9, 2024 in Paris, with Paramore opening the show. Next, it'll be stops in Sweden, Portugal, Spain and so much more.
