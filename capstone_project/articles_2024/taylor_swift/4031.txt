It's Saturday and it's time for another Weekend Discussion.
Welcome to the weekend! Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Let's jump into the Saturday edition of Weekend Discussion.
'One' shall stand
Well... it's... different. I'll give it that.
Super mushrooms

The FIRST time they tried this ghost busting thing again
Right up until Frozen Empire, these Ghostbusters movies sure did love just doing the first one again, didn't they?
"The, Hard, The"

Take us home, Taylor Swift and Post Malone!
That's it for this Weekend Discussion! Thank you for reading all year. We're excited to hear from you, so join the conversation and dive into the Shacknews Chatty comment thread below. If you want to go new school and find different ways to leave your feedback or talk about whatever, join us in the Official Shacknews Community Discord. I'll see you all next week!
Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but heâ€™s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke?
