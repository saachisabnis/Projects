"You're literally flipping off your fans who paid to come and watch you," panelist Sara Haines said during the show's Hot Topics segment.

	The hosts of The View slammed Madonna on Friday (Jan. 19) after the icon was sued by two New York City men for starting her Celebration tour stops two hours late.

	“I personally wouldn’t wait two hours to get a hot oil massage from George Clooney, much less a concert by anybody,” host Joy Behar said during The View‘s Hot Topics segment. However, Sunny Hostin wasn’t “bothered” by the situation. “I don’t think she should be sued,” she said. “This is baked into Madonna. She’s an icon. She’s always late. When you go to a Madonna concert, you know you have to eat before, you have to get lit before, and you’re going to wait about two hours and listen to a DJ.”

	However, the group noted that most acts including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, John Legend, Jennifer Lopez and more, all start their shows on time. 

	“Insert any person’s name who are two hours late. It’s disrespectful,” Sara Haines added. “You’re literally flipping off your fans who paid to come and watch you. You can be a diva. You should not act like a diva. To me, Madonna is not there.”

	Haines continued, “Beyoncé? Always on time. Taylor Swift, Pink, that’s called respectful. It’s how you’re raised. You respect someone’s time the way you expect them to respect yours. You showed up here. They paid hundreds of dollars.”
FANS SUE MADONNA OVER LATE CONCERT START: After two fans took legal action against Madonna because she was over two hours late for her concert, #TheView co-hosts react. https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA pic.twitter.com/sSjKhRyFpb

	Madonna is currently facing a federal class action lawsuit after allegedly starting her three New York City concerts later than scheduled, a delay that her accusers — show attendees Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden — say caused harm to themselves and other ticket buyers who “had to get up early to go to work” the next day.

	In a complaint filed Wednesday (Jan. 17) in Brooklyn federal court, Fellows and Hadden claim Madge breached her contract with concertgoers and violated New York state laws by starting the shows in Brooklyn’s Barclays Center past 10:30 p.m. instead of the scheduled 8:30 p.m. The two men say attendees were “left stranded in the middle of the night,” as the show ended past 1 a.m., and some were “confronted with limited public transportation” options. They also point out that the concert took place “on a weeknight,” meaning they “had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day.”
