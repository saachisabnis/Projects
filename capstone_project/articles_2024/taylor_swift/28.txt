Taylor Swift holds seven of the top 10 titles on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart (dated Jan. 6), marking the first time any act has concurrently claimed as many titles in the region since the chart launched in 1991. Previously, Swift held the record for the most concurrent albums in the top 10 on Top Album Sales, with six, on three separate weeks.

	Swift leads the latest list with her most recent release, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), which rules for a fourth nonconsecutive week. She also populates the top 10 with former chart-toppers at Nos. 2, 4, 6-8 and 10.

	The Jan. 6-dated chart reflects album sales in the U.S. in the final tracking week of 2023 (Dec. 22-28), as tabulated by data-tracking firm Luminate, thus capturing some last-minute holiday shopping relating to the Christmas Day holiday on Dec. 25. Most of Swift’s sales for the week were owed to vinyl purchases. Of Swift’s total album sales across all of her albums for the week, including those not in the top 10, vinyl sales accounted for 65% of her total sales.

Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart’s history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album units and streaming equivalent album units.
