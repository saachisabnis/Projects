Beyoncé’s latest album Cowboy Carter is a family affair as it features a guest appearance from six-year-old daughter Rumi Carter.
While the eagerly anticipated project features big names such as Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, Queen Bey also collaborates with Rumi, one of the twins she gave birth to in 2017.

Rumi appears on “Protector,” the fourth song on the lengthy 27-track country album, and can be heard briefly in the intro where she says: “Mom, can I hear the lullaby please?”
A tender acoustic ballad, the song is about Beyoncé’s love of her children and features lyrics such as: “I will lead you down that road if you lose your way/ Born to be a protector/ Even though I know someday you’re gonna shine on your own/ I will be your projector.”
The heartfelt song quickly stirred an emotional response from fans following Cowboy Carter‘s release on Friday (March 28).
One wrote on social media: “k but Beyoncé wait because I wasn’t ready for PROTECTOR” alongside a gif of Dua Lipa crying.

Another said: “PROTECTOR IS A MASTERPIECE OH BEYONCÉ I’M WEEPING” while sharing an equally emotional gif.

Rumi is not the first of Beyoncé’s children with husband JAY-Z to have appeared on a song with her.
The singer’s eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, appeared on “Brown Skin Girl” from 2019’s The Lion King soundtrack album.
