Taylor Swift may be closing the book on her brief but pivotal relationship with Jake Gyllenhall with “The Manuscript.”
On April 19, Swift dropped her record-breaking 31-track double album The Tortured Poets Department. For the most part she appears to reflect on her summer situationship with The 1975 front man Matty Healy following her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn, but I'd like to draw your attention to one section of her introductory poem from Target's exclusive Tortured Poets vinyl:
And so I was out of the oven and into the microwave
Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave
How gallant to save the empress from her gilded tower
Swinging a sword he could barely lift
But loneliness struck at that fateful hour
Low hanging fruit on her wine stained lips
He never even scratched the surface of me
None of them did
“None of them” likely includes Gyllenhaal, whose brief romance with Swift in 2010 is widely believed to have inspired her 2012 heartbreak ballad “All Too Well” and its extended 10-minute version released in 2021. Now Swifties suspect “The Manuscript” closes the book depicted in Swift's “All Too Well” short film starring actors Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.
Many fans are connecting the songs' dissection of the central couple's age gap. In the bridge of “All Too Well,” Swift sings, “You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine. And that made me want to die.” Swift was 20 when she dated 29-year-old Gyllenhaal in 2010.
And no, he hasn't listened to Red (Taylor's Version). 
In “The Manuscript,” she writes, “In the age of him, she wished she was 30 and made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press. Afterwards she only atе kids' cereal and couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed.” She later continued, “She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years everything had been aboveboard. She wasn't sure.”
While some Swiftstorians think “The Manuscript” lyrics actually reference John Mayer, who dated the pop star from 2009 to 2010 when he was 31 and she was 19 years old. However, the lyric “then she dated boys who were her own age” seemingly disproves that theory as Swift dated Gyllenhaal after that relationship came to an end. Who knows? Maybe it's both.

Meanwhile, TikTok user Caro Reiser believes the bridge of “The Manuscript” specifically references Swift's experience directing the “All Too Well” short film. “Then the actors were hitting their marks and the slow dance was alight with the sparks and the tears fell in synchronicity with the score,” Swift sings. “And at last, she knew what the agony had been for.”
“We all remember Sadie Sink crying while ‘All Too Well’ was playing in the background,” Reiser said in her video, which has more than 20,000 likes. “It's about ‘All Too Well.’”

“I'm pretty sure it's about Jake and how the process of releasing ATW10 and creating the short film allowed her to finally let go of what happened,” one X.com user agreed. “I think the line about her rereading her manuscript is her saying she no longer ‘remembers it all too well.’”

Now and then she rereads the manuscriptOf the entire torrid affairThey compared their licensesHe said, “I'm not a donor butI'd give you my heart if you needed it”She rolled her eyes and said“You're a professional”He said, “No, just a good Samaritan”He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation wasSoon they'd be pushin' strollersBut soon it was over
In the age of him, she wished she was 30And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch pressAfterwards she only atе kids' cerealAnd couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bedThen she dated boys who were her own ageWith dart boards on the backs of their doorsShe thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her yearsEverything had been above boardShe wasn't sure
And the years passedLike scenes of a showThe professor said to write what you knowLookin' backwardsMight be the only way to move forwardThen the actorsWere hitting their marksAnd the slow danceWas alight with the sparksAnd the tears fellIn synchronicity with the scoreAnd at lastShe knew what the agony had been for
The only thing that's left is the manuscriptOne last souvenir from my trip to your shoresNow and then I reread the manuscriptBut the story isn't mine anymore
