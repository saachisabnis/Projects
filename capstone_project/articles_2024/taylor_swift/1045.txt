Seeing the Detroit Lions take a historic loss in the NFC National Champion to the San Fransisco 49ers after a 17 point lead at halftime, feels like someone used salt instead of sugar in our koolaid.
Around Michigan, Lions fans are mourning the loss of this season as we got dangerously close to kissing the Super Bowl in their own ways. Some of us are making jokes, while others are choosing violence against anyone who they thought got in the way of the win.
There are many ways to cope with a loss like the one that the Detroit Lions experienced last night... some of us are a little angry like Eminem was at the start of the game when the 49ers came out of the tunnel...

Others are choosing to be thankful for the season we had, even if it was cut too short right before the Super Bowl

Or maybe you can be like this Southwest Michigan radio station who is pointing the fingers at the real obvious culprit, the band that snubbed Detroit during the halftime show:
No matter how you're coping this morning, please know you're not alone. Let the memes flow, because we all know laughter is the greatest cure for a heartbreaking playoffs loss.

Maybe next time it won't take us as long to make it to the NFC Championship...
