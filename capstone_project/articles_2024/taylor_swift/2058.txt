Why is Gen Z (people born between 1997 and 2012) drinking far less at concerts than the previous generations?
According to a live music CEO from Minneapolis, one of the biggest reasons is edibles.
"One of the big trends we’re seeing is that Gen Z doesn’t drink as much. They’re either eating edibles before they come or there’s more of a sober, mental health [focus]… Most of the ticket price goes on to the band, so really what [venues] subsist on is beverages. That’s not going to be a sustainable revenue stream," the CEO said, per Consequence.
According to Billboard, the new trend, which is hurting smaller concert venues, began to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Coming out of COVID-19, everything about the live music business was turned upside down," another live music professional told the outlet.
The same person noted that there's a 25 percent difference between Gen Z's alcohol consumption at concerts and that of millennials, Gen X and boomers.

Texas State University professor of psychology Ty Schepis said that while alcohol use is trending down among college students, marijuana use has risen to 37 percent.
On Twitter/X, one concertgoer highlighted the trend by blaming the decline in drinking at concerts on the expensive prices of drinks at venues.
"Madison Square Garden charged me $40 for a tequila sunrise," they wrote.
In a reply to the original tweet, they joked, "Follow me if you’ve also been victimized by MSG drink prices."
Other fans shared similar stories in response.
"Me when I got a tequila redbull and the bill was $48," one person tweeted.
"Me and my $26 whiteclaw against the world," someone else shared.
Another person confirmed they are part of the demographic who would much rather enjoy some marijuana than shell out money for high-priced drinks.
"I’m pulling out my joints and sparking up. Saving myself a $100 tab," they tweeted.
