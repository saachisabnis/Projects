With the Super Bowl only days away, the excitement is building, not just for the do-over battle between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs but for the whole spectacle that accompanies it. We surveyed our RotoWire subscriber base for their thoughts on the big game, and the findings are rather interesting. Let's sift through the data to see how fans feel about the Super Bowl.
With sportsbooks tipping the scales in favor of the 49ers, the survey's tilt towards the Kansas City Chiefs at 53.4 percent adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, transforming the Super Bowl stage into a suspense-packed arm-wrestling match between twins of equal strength. Despite the odds, the 49ers, basking in a sturdy 46.6 percent fan support and carrying the sportsbooks' favor, are not the underdogs in this tale but perhaps the stealthy dark horses, primed to unleash a surprise that could flip the script in the blink of an eye.
The Super Bowl excitement is surging with more energy than the Hoover Dam will be pumping into Las Vegas this weekend. Over half of the fans are turning up the voltage on their enthusiasm, cranking it to an electrifying 4 or 5. This isn't just any game; it's the NFL's monumental finale, the zenith of the season where legends carve their names and dreams illuminate the field in the most anticipated showdown.
Taylor Swift's affiliation with the NFL is seen as positive by nearly 70 percent of fans. However, the lukewarm interest in her attending the Super Bowl or leading the next halftime show suggests fans might prefer their football playlist Swift-free. 
Patrick Mahomes and Christian McCaffrey leading the MVP predictions is hardly shocking, but the game's nature means any of the listed talents could steal the spotlight during the game.  It's a reminder that in football, as in life, the underdog can have their day. 
That a whopping 76.1 percent are most looking forward to the game itself reaffirms the Super Bowl's essence. It's not just about the spectacle but the raw, unpredictable drama of sport, where every play can turn the tide. 
The overwhelming preference for humorous commercials is a gentle nudge that perhaps, amidst the high stakes, a good laugh is as appreciated as a touchdown. Seems advertisers should be hiring more SNL writers and fewer celebrities to champion their commercials.
The preference for watching the Super Bowl at home highlights the comfort and camaraderie of familiar surroundings. It's a testament to the game's ability to turn living rooms into stadiums complete with cheering fans. 
With two thirds of fans ready to place bets, it's clear that the Super Bowl is in line to be the most wagered-on event in history. It's a reminder that for many, the thrill of the game is matched by the thrill of the gamble. 
The diverse wishes for next year's halftime show, from rock legends to pop icons, reflect the mosaic of musical tastes that populate the NFL fanbase. It's a vibrant reminder that while football unites us, our playlists set us apart.
