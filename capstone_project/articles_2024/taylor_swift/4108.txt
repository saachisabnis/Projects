(Gray News) - Taylor Swift is once again shattering records.
Swift’s latest album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” became the most streamed LP on its first day across Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music.
The double album, with a total of 31 songs, was streamed 300 million times on Friday on Spotify alone, while its opening track, “Fortnight,” became the platform’s most-streamed song in a single day.
“The Tortured Poets Department. An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time - one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure,” Swift wrote across social media when the album dropped at midnight on Friday. “This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”
This is Swift’s 11th studio album and she has literally outdone herself.
The Spotify title was previously held by her 10th album, “Midnights.”
Last year, Swift also became Spotify’s most-streamed artist overall with more than 26 billion streams worldwide.
