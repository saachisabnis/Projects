Whether you play music or enjoy listening to it, chances are you've heard of Gibson. Gibson makes some of the highest-quality items musical instruments available and many of those instruments are made right here in Montana.
Gibson is one of the biggest brands in the world, and since the late 1980s, have made all of their acoustic guitars in Bozeman after it was discovered that Bozeman has the perfect climate for making acoustic instruments. However, the history of the instrument maker goes far beyond that time frame.
It's quite an interesting story.
Founded in 1894 by Orville Gibson, the company would start by making mandolins before expanding into guitars. Orville was known for his attention to detail, ensuring that each instrument met his high expectations, a practice that the Gibson company continues to this day.
The company started in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and would remain there for several decades before moving to Nashville, Tennessee. While they still make electric instruments in Nashville, as mentioned above, all the acoustic guitars are made here in Montana.
I had a chance to tour the Gibson plant in Bozeman a couple of years ago and it was something to see. Each guitar is handcrafted and the amount of individual detail that goes into each instrument is truly amazing. From the hand sanding to the hand-painted pickguards, each guitar is a labor of love and no two are the same.
One of the most interesting parts of it all is that no matter who you are if you buy a Gibson acoustic guitar, it will be made by Montanans. So whether you're Taylor Swift, or just someone like me that wants one of the best guitars out there, they're all made at the same place, by the same people.
