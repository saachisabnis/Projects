An X-rated video depicting what appeared to be Drake engaging in a sexual act was the talk of social media on Tuesday, but the Canadian-born rapper seemed to respond to the incident in good humor.
As Drake’s name became a top-trending term on X, Kick streamer Adin Ross, who has previously appeared in videos with the rapper, recorded a voice memo which he claimed he sent to Drake.
“We was just looking at the s–. It’s like crazy bro, like goddamn,” Ross laughed in the voice memo. “You’re blessed with your voice, you’re blessed with performing, you’re blessed to be you, you’re blessed to be number one — but you’re also blessed to have a f–ing missile.”
A few moment later, Ross announced Drake texted him back with “like eight laughing emojis.” The streamer also claimed Drake said he might save the voice memo and use it as the intro to his next album.
There’s been no confirmation yet, from either the rapper or his team, on whether the video was really of him or if he truly sent that response Adin Ross.
Just weeks ago, X made a concerted effort to rid the platform of AI-generated deepfake phonographic material that depicted Taylor Swift. The Elon Musk-owned site, formerly known as Twitter, also made her name unsearchable for a brief time on Jan. 27, in attempt to protect Swift’s likeness from being abused.
X did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Tuesday regarding the video allegedly featuring Drake.
The 37-year-old rapper was in the news just days ago, making headlines with a critical take on the Grammys ahead of Sunday night’s awards.
“All you incredible artists remember this show isn’t the facts — it’s just the opinion of a group of people whose names are kept a secret,” Drake wrote on his Instagram story right before the ceremony began.
“Literally. You can Google it. Congrats to anybody winning anything for hip-hop, but this show doesn’t dictate s– in our world,” he added.
