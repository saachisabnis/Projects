Jennifer Lopez’s new documentary The Greatest Love Story Never Told contains a scene in which she listens as her team tells her about the all the A-list names who declined to appear in the musical film that accompanied her album This Is Me…Now. The list included Taylor Swift, Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, and Lizzo, who claims she had no idea.
“Ain’t nobody told me nothin,'” she said in a new video. “Nobody asked me! JLo, I love you.” In the scene, JLo’s team explains that Lizzo was busy, and it’s likely the request never made it past her management.
