Sugarland made a big return to country music when they performed "Take Me Home" with Little Big Town at the 2024 CMT Music Awards on Sunday (April 7).
"Take Me Home" is a Phil Collins' song, written and recorded for his No Jacket Required album (1985). It's among the rock legends' most famous songs, but Sugarland and Little Big Town had no trouble putting a fresh spin on it.
Little Big Town opened the performance at Austin's Moody Center, but the familiar vocals of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush soon announced Sugarland's latest reunion. While members of both ensembles sang individual lyrics at times, it was their collective harmonies that the audience will remember.
The performance was not the first time all six singers have been on stage together: Sugarland and Little Big Town linked up with Jake Owen to sing "LifeÂ in a Northern Town" in 2009.
It's been seven years since Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles put out a country project. Their sixth studio album Bigger arrived in 2017 with singles like "Still the Same" and "Babe," featuring Taylor Swift in the tracklist.
Both Sugarland and Little Big Town have had successful histories with the CMT Music Awards. Combined, the country acts have logged 44 nominations, with 25 of those for Little Big Town. Both have won four awards over the years.
The CMT Music Awards were held at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas on Sunday, April 7. Hosted by Kelsea Ballerini, the fan-voted show aired live on CBS and is now available to stream on Paramount+.
