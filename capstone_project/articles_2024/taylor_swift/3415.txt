Jason, 36, recently announced his retirement from the NFL after 13 seasons.
The Bearcat-turned-NFL star spent his entire career with the Philadelphia Eagles, who drafted him in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft out of Cincinnati.
He came to UC as a walk-on linebacker before switching to the offensive line.
In 2008 and 2009, he started all 13 games for the Bearcats at left guard. Jason Kelce earned second-team all-Big East honors in 2009.
The future Hall of Famer was teammates at UC with Taylor Swift’s boyfriend and his brother, Travis.
As a center for the Eagles, Jason earned six All-Pro selections, was a seven-time Pro Bowler, and won the Super Bowl in 2017.
The duo made history in 2023 as the first brothers to play against each other at the Super Bowl. Travis’ Chiefs won the game.
“New Heights” episodes are available on Amazon Music.
Travis, who will also find himself in Canton one day, is a four-time All-Pro who will go down in history as one of the best tight ends to ever play.
