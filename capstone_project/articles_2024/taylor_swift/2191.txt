Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are in the middle of a Love Story, a fact we know All Too Well (sorry, I'll stop).
But there have been fans who have wondered if we'll get an album full of songs about the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and -- hopefully -- not after their relationship ended, as we've seen with some of the past tunes from Swift that have referenced some past relationships.
While we don't know the answer to whether the next album after The Tortured Poets Department will be My MVP or something, there's one report from US Weekly: She's already penned some Kelce tunes.
Here's more from the report:
“Taylor has already written songs about Travis [Kelce],” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “She’s written at least two songs. They have to do with their love story and falling in love with him.”
According to the insider, Swift’s songs are “very personal” but devoted fans might not get to hear them.
“She likely won’t share them with anyone. They’re very special,” the source adds. “Songs are like poetry to her. Just like most people journal, Taylor writes lyrics. Her relationship with Travis has inspired her.”
Intriguing!
