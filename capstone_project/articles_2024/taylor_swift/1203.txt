Leonardo DiCaprio looks a far cry from his normal dapper appearance as he stepped onto the set of his new movie.
The Hollywood star, 49, sported a dishevelled look for the Paul Thomas Anderson project currently titled BC Project. Leo was seen in an all grey, washed-out outfit, made up of a jacket and trouser combo. He also wore a darker zip-up jumper underneath. His hair appeared greasy and tied back, while he showed off his new horseshoe moustache as he got into a vehicle.
The new images come after he had got into character earlier in the week wearing scruffy clothes as he used a phone box. He wore dirty-looking checkered coat, old trainers and a beanie hat in the previous images.

The plot for the new flick is being kept tightly under wraps, but it's said to have a star-studded line-up that also includes Sean Penn and Regina Hall and has a budget close to $100million (Â£80million).
The production comes as fans were shocked by Leo's Oscar snub for his part in Killers of the Flower Moon. While director Martin Scorsese earned his tenth best director nomination for the 1920s-set drama, making him the most nominated director alive, Leonardo was left off the nomination list once again for his performance. His co-star Robert De Niro did, however, make the cut and is up for best supporting actor a record 49 years after his first nomination for The Godfather Part II.
Earlier this month, a more clean-cut version of Leo was present on the red carpet at the 14th Annual Governors Awards. He attended without a date as the rumour mill continues to swirl about his dating life.
Recently, he was linked with his ex Kate Moss' little sister, Lottie. In December last year, the pair were spotted enjoying a restaurant 'date' together, getting tongues wagging. As the movie star, partied at the same venue as 25-year-old Lottie, onlookers admitted the pair looked 'really close'. The potential pairing came after a rumoured romance with Vittoria Ceretti over the summer.
