This pre-Grammys look is one for the ages
There's no denying it, the past twelve months have *really* been Ice Spice's year. The Bronx-born rapper first broke through with the viral TikT0k success of her 2022 single "Munch (Feelin' U)" but really got into her musical stride throughout 2023, collaborating with the likes of Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj and PinkPantheress and dropping her first EP.
Her fashion has also been majorly iconic throughout the past year - rocking a see-through black LBD and thong, a striped skin-tight catsuit with major Beetlejuice energy, and repping a knitted mini dress for a night out with Doja Cat. 
And, now, she's nominated for a whopping four Grammys at the 2024 ceremony - which will take place later tonight. In the interim, however, she's given fans a taster of the major fashion she's getting ready to serve at the prestigious awards show.
At the pre-Grammys Clive Davis Gala, on 3 Feb, she rocked a sleek, form-fitting, asymetric black dress. And if this outfit is any indication, then the cutout trend won't be disappearing any time soon.
Specifically, Ice's look featured a major cutout at the sternum and stomach and the rapper appeared to have opted to go bra-free under the ensemble, leaving her chest completely uncovered. The dress also featured a huge leg slit that left her right leg completely bare from the foot up to the hip.
Whatever the outcome of tonight's Grammys, we know that Ice Spice will always be a winner - especially in the fashion stakes.
