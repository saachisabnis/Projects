Summertime in Jersey means the return of incredible outdoor concerts.
In South Jersey, Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden is host to many big-name concerts.
This summer their concert calendar includes such stellar acts like Dave Matthews Band, Dierks Bentley, Alanis Morissette, and more.
How would you like to be at all the shows, and get paid while attending?
Big concert venues like the one in Camden require many people working together to make the concert experience a good one.
Live Nation, the prominent concert promoter, hires hundreds, if not thousands each summer to help make everyone's concert experience great.
If you're looking for summertime employment, you should make plans to attend a job fair that Live Nation is hosting on March 23rd from 10 until 2 at the pavilion in Camden.
They have all kinds of opportunities to make some extra money and be a part of the excitement of being at the shows.
They're looking for people to help with areas like event security, parking attendants, guest services, and even a position they call, Zero Waste Captain. 
I should point out that while you'll get to go to some cool concerts, these are real jobs, and real responsibilities.  All the same, these are still cool jobs.
Live Nation is the largest concert promoter in the country.  They have a lot of seasonal opportunities in Camden, but if you're looking for something more, they have quite a few full-time professional positions throughout the United States.
