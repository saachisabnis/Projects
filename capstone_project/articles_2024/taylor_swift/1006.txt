The world has been WILD since March of 2020 and we here at Twitchy try to help you laugh at it all so we don't cry and fall into a collective deep depression. The GOP seems to be kind of fractured but we are here to bring you hope. We have found something to unify us!
We present to you our presumptive nominee for the BEST Tweet of January 2024. We know that could cause some discomfort for some since there are still a few days left in the month, but we honestly feel like this is something we can all get behind.
The year is 2024Texas leads a coalition of over 20 states who oppose the federal governmentTaylor Swift is the biggest name in professional footballBen Shapiro is the number one rapper in the countryIt‚Äôs only January
Auron MacIntyre is a host and columnist over at The Blaze and yes we understand he is not associated with Twitchy so we feel like that makes our nonbiased opinion on the greatness of that tweet hold even more weight.¬†
That tweet is absolutely fabulous. Some of the responses listing things that were left out also had us rolling. The fact there were still things to add does not take away the greatness of the tweet. You have to take into account he crafted that tweet so nobody had to hit the see more link and the succinct style adds to its winning the honor of being named the 'presumptive nominee'.¬†

*SNORT* Those are all hilarious! We did not make any of this stuff up.¬†
Add: in Rhode Island, the Dept of Health wants to publish a rule that they can mask kids in K-12 even if there's no science at all to support it.
That one is not funny that one is ridiculous! Rhode Island may need to be 2nd runner-up to California for 'Crappiest State of January 2024'. California is always ridiculous so they have to be first.¬†
‚ÄúIt all started back in 2016, when a kid fell into an exhibit at the zoo with a gorilla named Harambe‚Äù - Me to my grandkids in 2063 https://t.co/TOAd9x3TAI
WOW! That retro-reference to Harambe is brilliant! Poor Harambe.¬†
So many people loved this tweet and laughed. At the time of writing this piece, it had 2000 RTs and 11,000 likes. It should get way more because it is X at its best.¬†
