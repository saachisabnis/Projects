Times have changed for the Chiefs.
A little more than a year ago, the Chiefs were the focus of a goofy proclamation from Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce later called Pureval a jabroni, and everyone in Kansas City had a good laugh.
Now Kelce is dating international singing sensation Taylor Swift, and that’s led to a media release from the Japan Embassy in Washington D.C.
Swift, who saw the Chiefs win the AFC Championship Game in Baltimore on Sunday, soon will be heading to Japan to begin the latest leg of her Eras Tour. She will be playing four shows in Tokyo starting on Wednesday.
The last of those concerts will be Saturday, one day before the Chiefs play the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. People have mapped out how Swift can make it to Las Vegas in time to see Kelce and the Chiefs.
The Japan Embassy put out that statement assuring fans that Swift will play all four dates in Tokyo, using some of her song titles to make its point. It also mentions the Chiefs.
“The Embassy of Japan in the United States is aware of recent media reports concerning the steps Taylor Swift will need to take to travel from Tokyo after her concert on February 10th to Las Vegas in time to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play in Super Bowl LVIII,” the statement says.
“Despite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now, to say that if she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins.
“We know that many people in Japan are excited to experience Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. So we wanted to confirm that anyone concerned can be Fearless in knowing that this talented performer can wow Japanese audiences and still make it to Las Vegas to support the Chiefs when they take the field for the Super Bowl wearing Red.”
The Japan Embassy talking about the Chiefs? Yep, Swift has helped the Chiefs to gain even greater fame.
