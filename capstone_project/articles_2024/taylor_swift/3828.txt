Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was spotted with his arms wrapped around pop superstar girlfriend Taylor Swift and dancing to her among the crowd of festivalgoers at Coachella 2024 in Indio, California, this weekend.
Kelce and Swift, both 34, were seen in the crowd during her friend Ice Spice's set Saturday (April 13) night, which included dancing while the rapper performed her remix version of Swift's hit 'Karma.'
“I never thought I would be able to see Taylor in Coachella or in the middle of the crowd again in my life,” a fan commented on a TikTok video of the couple.
Several fans acknowledged how "safe" Swift appeared to be in public with her 6-foot-5, 250-pound boyfriend.
"Travis is the only bodyguard she needs," another fan wrote.
Swift was also spotted wearing a green hat promoting the 'New Heights' podcast hosted by her boyfriend and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles All-Pro center Jason Kelce, which she turned backwards at one point while dancing.
The three-time Super Bowl champion famously revealed that he attempted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number when he attended her concert at Arrowhead Stadium prior to their relationship last summer. Swift later said that Kelce "very adorably put me on blast" when he acknowledged the situation on his podcast, which she said "was metal as hell" while being featured as Time Magazine's 'Person of the Year' in December 2023.
