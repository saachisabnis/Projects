Up until a few weeks ago, we’ve seen people tracking Taylor Swift’s planes to see if she’s showing up to Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs games to cheer on the tight end. 
But one Instagram account that has been doing that is gone, not that it would matter for Sunday — Swift was snapped with Brittany Mahomes and Lyndsey Bell, with People reporting that she dined with them in Los Angeles on Saturday.
Does that mean Swift will attend the game that kicks off at 4:25 p.m. ET there?
The answer is: Probably not. Swift is scheduled to attend the Golden Globes that same day, and reports have said she won't make it.
Here are photos from her night out, though!
