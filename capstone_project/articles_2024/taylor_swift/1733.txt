Taylor Swift has donated $100,000 to the surviving family of a woman who was shot and killed on Wednesday (Feb. 14) after a parade celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl victory.
Lopez-Galvan was a DJ at local radio station KKFI 90.1. A GoFundMe set up to benefit her family originally aimed to raise $75,000, but Swift single-handedly exceeded that goal with two donations of $50,000 apiece, bringing the total as of Friday morning (Feb. 16) to just under $200,000.
"Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss," Swift writes to accompany each donation, adding, "With love, Taylor Swift."
A representative for Swift confirmed to Variety that the donations came from Swift.
Swift was on hand during Super Bowl 58 on Sunday, when her boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22. She was not there in person for the victory parade on Wednesday.
