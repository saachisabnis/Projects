Ice Spice is giving fans more clues about her upcoming debut album. On Saturday night, April 6, the Bronx rapper took to her X account and promoted her upcoming performance at Coachella. Ice Spice posted a graphic that features a blinged-out sidekick phone with a message that encourages her fans to meet her at annual music festival in Indio, California. In the email signature, she included a pre-emoji kiss face with the hashtag #y2k and promoted the festival's two dates. Since she added the hashtag, fans believe she may have teased a potential release date for the album. 
This isn't the clue Ice Spice has shared about her Y2K album. In a recent episode of Complex's "Hot Ones," the Grammy-nominated artist confirmed her next project officially passed the "car test." She also opened up about one song in particular in which she completely switches up her sound. “There is a track on the album, I just launched straight into the verse and there’s not really a hook so I’m excited to hear what the fans think about that,” she said. “Each song that I work on I really try to make it good enough to put out basically. I don’t really skim through it real quick, I really take my time and I’m just like OK. Every time I work on a song basically, I’m like, ‘This is gonna be released.'”It's been over a year since Ice Spice dropped the deluxe version of her debut EP Like..? The 11-track project features her smash hits like "Princess Diana" with Nicki Minaj and "Deli." She went on to appear in "Barbie World" with Minaj and Aqua for the Barbie soundtrack. The collaboration earned two Grammy nominations as well as her other hit song "Karma" (Remix) with Taylor Swift. Look out for Y2K coming soon.
