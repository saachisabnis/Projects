There are a couple of fascinating themed rental properties in Lubbock. I've covered everything from a snuggly Christmas-themed AirbnbÂ where you can celebrate your favorite holiday year-round, to an entire rental park comprised of tiny homes made from grain silos. I came across another fun one today that I think you'll get a kick out of...especially if you're all about the T-Swift...
The rental is called "The Getaway Era" and features 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and every amenity you can imagine. There are Taylor Swift photos, paintings, posters, and random memorabilia ALL over the house. It's a total vibe, and it looks like a great place for slumber parties and girly weekend getaways.
Guess what the shower curtain looks like?

What do you think? I like how they added a record player and a selection of her records for you to enjoy while you're staying on the property. That's a pretty cool touch. They did a great job with the color scheme too. I'm not even a huge T-Swift fan and I still want to go stay the weekend there.
Have you ever stayed in this rental? I'd love to hear from you about your experience. Please feel free to comment below this article, or reach out to me in an email at Chrissy.Covington@townsquaremedia.com.
