Toilet humour takes centre stage on Virgin Radio.
Leigh Francis, known for his irreverent wit and penchant for toilet humour, brought a touch of his trademark comedy to Ryan Tubridy's mid-morning show. 
While the conversation initially revolved around films and pop culture, including his recent appearance on The Great British Bake Off, it took an unexpected turn when Francis delved into the peculiar bathroom habits of a certain morning show presenter's husband.
In between discussions about Taylor Swift and Francis's extensive film memorabilia collection, which includes a 'three car garage full of shame', packed to the rafters with iconic props.
Amongst the detritus of some of cinema's most memorable props were apparently 'five proton packs' from the Ghostbuster's franchise, which Leigh gave a rather generous review to the latest instalment, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.
The conversation then veered towards embarrassing omissions in classic film viewing. 
Tubridy admitted to missing out on Tom Hanks' Castaway upon its release, while Francis expressed disbelief that his tour manager had never seen Star Wars, prompting the question: "How do you miss Star Wars? Where were you!?"
However, it was Francis's revelation about attending a screening of Back to the Future with Holly Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, that truly stole the show. 
While initially innocuous, Francis's anecdote took a comedic turn when he divulged Baldwin's peculiar restroom ritual.
"I went to see Back to the Future with Holly Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, who had never seen Back to the Future," Francis began. "Which is incredible. It's my favourite film."
But the hilarity ensued when Francis revealed Baldwin's unusual bathroom behaviour: "He went to the toilet. But when Dan goes to the toilet, he takes all his clothes off for some reason. I don't know why. I have heard some people do this."
As Francis recounted Baldwin's untimely departure during a crucial moment in the film, where Marty McFly finds himself in a sticky situation in the 1950s, the absurdity of the situation became apparent. 
"When he came back, so he left when Marty McFly was in the 80s. When he came back, he's in the 50s trying to get off of his mum," Francis quipped, leaving Tubridy and listeners alike in stitches.
The revelation about Baldwin's peculiar bathroom antics injected a dose of laughter into the airwaves, showcasing Francis's knack for turning even the most mundane anecdotes into comedic gold. 
And while the conversation may have strayed from its original topic, one thing became abundantly clear: when Leigh Francis is involved, expect the unexpected, especially when it comes to bathroom humour.
