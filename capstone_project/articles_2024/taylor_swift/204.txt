Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs warms up before the game against the Cincinnati Bengals at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on December 31, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri.
Taylor Swift's beau, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, may be a football star. But her cat, Olivia Benson (named after the Law And Order: Special Victims Unit character played by Mariska Hargitay) is a star in her own right. When it comes down to dollars and cents, Swift's adorable Scottish Fold makes more money than the superstar singer's boyfriend. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Kelce has an estimated net worth of $40 million, with a $14 million salary. Forbes reported that he makes an additional $3 million each year outside his football career in endorsements.
The beloved Benson is worth a whopping $97 million, as we have previously reported. While Kelce has earned his wealth over his decade in the NFL, Olivia is an Instagram influencer, has cameos in multiple music videos, starred in big-budget ad campaigns, and even has her own merchandise line. Olivia has starred alongside the 34-year-old pop star in commercials for DirectTV, Diet Coke, and AT&T. The feline also made appearances in Swift’s music videos for “Me!” and “Blank Space.” Swift has two other cats: her first cat, Scottish Fold Meredith Grey (named after the character from Grey's Anatomy), and Ragdoll Benjamin Button (after Brad Pitt's character from the film of the same name).
However, both Kelce and Swift's cats are left far behind when it comes to how much the singer-songwriter makes herself. After the massive success of her Eras Tour and concert film, the pop icon surpassed a billion dollars in October 2023. Swift earned $80 million from music sales, has $110 million in current property values, has earned $120 million from streaming earnings, $370 million in ticket sales and merchandise, and her re-released music since 2019 has an estimated $400 million value. With her Eras Tour continuing next month after a few months of break, the artist is sure to rake in even more money as she embarks on dates in Japan, Australia, Singapore, and France.
We all know those people who have accounts for their babies or pets. Did you know even Hollywood A-listers take part in that, too? It doesn't matter if you're famous or not -- if someone feels as though they've got some cuteness overload to share, there will be a page dedicated to that. We must admit, it is kind of charming for grown adults to run pages of cute content from the perspective of their furry friends. Some celebrities' pets have enough followers that their accounts have been verified on Instagram, while others are still steadily climbing in popularity to gain enough followers to get that blue checkmark.
For example, Paris Hilton has an entire Instagram dedicated to all of her “fur kids,” called Hilton Pets (@hiltonpets). The heiress has more than just dogs, which most people don't know. On her official website, the Simple Life alum has a page dedicated to all the pets she currently has and once had. This includes miniature pigs, ponies, ferrets, monkeys, cats, and bunnies -- oh my! Paris even has a verified TikTok account with the funniest and cutest videos featuring her adorable pets.
Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets is linked to several health benefits, according to the CDC. Pets can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. When cats purr, they emit a range of 20-140 Hz, which is known to be medically therapeutic for illnesses and lower stress. Most households in the United States have at least one pet.
Keep scrolling to see which celebrities have verified Instagram accounts for their adorable pets.
