BERTHOLD, N.D. (KFYR/Gray News) – A high school student in North Dakota became the talk of the prom when he brought a cardboard cutout of Taylor Swift as his date.
Shaun Randall’s family knows he is a big Swiftie, and his sister bought him the cardboard cutout as a joke.
But Randall decided to bring the gift with him to Berthold Public School’s prom on Saturday.
The teen took several photos with the Swift cutout, and Berthold Police Chief Al Schmidt even administered a breathalyzer to Swift.
Even though prom is over, Randall won’t be having a “cruel summer,” as he plans to spend time with Boy Scouts and leadership organization FFA.
