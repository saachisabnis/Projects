Home » Taylor Swift Songs Return To TikTok Despite Licensing Dispute
Taylor Swift’s songs have made a surprise return to TikTok after a 10-week absence due to a licensing dispute between the app and Universal Music Group. Multiple Swift tracks, including “You Belong With Me,” “Lover,” and “Cruel Summer,” are now available on the platform for user videos. This unexpected comeback precedes the release of Swift’s upcoming album, The Tortured Poets Department, set to debut on April 19. While TikTok and UMG have been at odds over licensing terms, it appears that Swift may have separately resolved the issue, leveraging her ownership of masters. When questioned about Swift’s music reappearing on TikTok, reps for the app, Swift, and UMG declined to comment.
