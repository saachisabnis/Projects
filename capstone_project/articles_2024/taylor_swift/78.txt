“This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try then how will we know it can’t be done? And if we do not try, it most certainly won’t be done. The Founders’ Republic, and the larger war for western civilization, will be lost.”
“But I tell you this: We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.” 
~ Mike Vanderboegh

Watching more video on Vivek.  He handles himself extremely well.  He would make a great director of communications for PDJT he declines DoD.
Ramaswamy’s being continually positioned and repositioned as saboteur within.  Did MAGA learn nothing from Pence?
Pence was the consummate Washington insider, Vivek is not. Saboteur? Hardly, but now Nikki, yes.
1.  How does not being a DC insider prevent one from being an insider?
2. Vivek, like Nikki, has ties to the WEF. 
3.  At the time of his birth, were his immigrant parents naturalized citizens?
4.  Just weeks ago, many thought Johnson would be an improvement over McCarthy and things would change. How has that worked out?
Nimarata is threatening to sacrifice our brightest and best. Poisonous Schwab acolyte.
The question asking whether she is constitutionally qualified to even run is needed. 
Loudly and publicly so that not even her donors can avoid answering it.
Grenell is right!
Never Nikki and her
absolute stupidity
concerning geopolitics
should be a red flag
to all Americans.
 I wouldn’t vote for her
even if she ran for
dog catcher.
He is right, gypsy. 
I’ll go one better…I wouldn’t let her walk my dog.
She knows Putin has never said anything like the lie she just spewed with her blood encrusted maw.
Never.
Unfortunately, I dare say most of America, uninformed and ignorant of anything within this country (either through incuriosity or through having to hang on to their lives by their fingernails with no time to do anything else because of the devastation wreaked by Biden/Obama regime)…never  mind anywhere else around the globe…will take her bald falsehood as fact. 
She is dangerous…and evil.
Because I love dogs, I hate those expressions.
“Wouldn’t let her babysit my houseplant” or “watch my lawn grow” is more like it.
There whole syrategy has collapsed, NOTHING they have tried, has succeeded in driving a wedge between PDJT and his supporters, and in fact everything they have tried has been counter-productive.
They crave CONTROL, and they are LOSING it, and like holding a fish, the tighter they grasp, the more they lose control.
I really do not think there are that many ‘sheeple’, as a % of the population, left.
In part, because its a one way journey; does anyone who truly red pills, despite how much they emotionally would LIKE to  EVER go back to “not seeing”? NO.
Hence, “converts” or the process of converting can ONLY go one way: FROM Blue, to RED.
Dutch, with that statement of hers, that threatening lie, she’s getting too close to my 18 year old twin grandsons for my liking.
And I am not the only one with grandsons, sons, daughters, granddaughters who understands what she is threatening.
Were she in the Oval Office (which she will never be), asking Congress to activate the draft for her would be the work of a second…not minute…second.
That she includes women in her vile false statement just tells you how truly soulless and unfit for any office she is.
She is, in my view, a monster, a bottom feeder, and a lover of war and the death which comes with it.
I hope she gets buried in ignominious defeat. In fact, for the sake of what’s left of this country, I pray for it.
See, made her the incarnation of Satan, the epitome of evil, without once mentioning dogs, ,..
I just KNEW a wordsmith like yourself could do it.
And, I agree she IS vile, although like Ron, Mitch, Mittens, etc. she is just a front for the truly vile shadow dwellers,..
She may be a front, my friend…
But we know people by the company they keep. 
The cancer has metastasized and has her now.
Many people here trust no one, literally, other than PTrump to be pure MAGA conservative.  No matter what. So they come at these others like Vivek with extreme suspicion until proven otherwise, which in their opinion is pretty much never are these others proven ok. Many times being fooled makes one very skittish about taking any good speaking person at their words only, as it should be really. It does get carried a little bit further here on the branches though. Vivek is certainly saying really strong and conservative comments on issues that are blatantly destroying this country. Does he mean them? Unknown. DeSantis did too for awhile and we wanted to believe him but look what happened.   So time to wait and dig into Vivek some more before accepting him into the MAGA fold.
time after time, the people pushing themselves on us prove themselves false.
Every Presidential candidate between Reagan and Trump, and most of those Trump beat proclaimed themselves the next Reagan.  Time and again we were disappointed and betrayed.  Three decades of betrayal.
Not just betrayal in Presidential contests but betrayal in all politics.  Senators, Representatives, appointees, Governors, State politics, betrayal is standard.  The very few who don’t get overwhelmed by the vast mass of betrayers.
We even come up with terms for them.  RINOs, CONservatives, decepticons, Uniparty, back stabbers.  
RonDe had a history that many of us missed.  Even as he was enacting good stuff, some here reminded us that he was different when he was a congressman.  As is often the case, we who missed his history ignored it when we were informed.  It wasn’t until it was becoming obvious that he was hiding instead of defending Trump that we started realizing the unMAGA truth about RonDe.
We have had similar warnings about Vivek’s past.  But, he shares with RonDe the same essential anti-MAGA behavior.  They are literally running against Trump!
I for one find it frustrating that so many ignore that major problem.  
Maybe Vivek is Trump’s surrogate to defend Trump and attack the other candidates.  Or maybe he is running to be chosen VP.  But even if those maybes were true, he is still running against Trump.
Jim in TN,
“he is still running against Trump.”
You hit the nail on the head………
He mimics President Trump’s rally speeches and themes as a shield, nothing more.
We have too many real American MAGAs to pick from rather than a newbie to America’s culture and history.
He may be what he says he is, if so let’s see him in 2028 or even 2032.
Our children and grandchildren deserve not to be saddled by the likes of the aniti-Americans who have recently populated the parties.
“Let’s go Brandon and the democrats and the GOPe!”
Romney is one guy I’m ashamed to say I voted for. He had US convinced he was Republican, he is most certainly not.
Oh but he is Republican…..lines straight up with the GOPe.
You hit the nail on the head!!👏👏
No matter who it is
one fact remains….
THEY ARE RUNNING AGAINST
PRESIDENT TRUMP!!
💁🤷‍♀️💁🤷‍♀️
It is the KISS…..
Keep It Simple Stupid 😆😂😂
What Vivek did to earn his first $Billion was dishonest, harmful, and should be illegal.
He bought a failed Alzheimer’s drug that had failed four tests to see if it helped with Alzheimer’s symptoms. He renamed, rebranded, and had his mother doctor fix one test to make it appear like the drug worked. That should be illegal. So if he will con families into believing his failed drug will help their loved ones, he is certainly capable of conning MAGA Patriots.
Vivek is running AGAINST Real President Trump.
That’s all MAGA needs to know.  
Meatball outed himself.
Vivek literally was sponsored by George Soros brother and wife while doing his bio research.  I don’t need to know anything else about him ever again.  If they funded him, they own him.  And even if they don’t, it’s too risky knowing they’ve been that close.
I, personally trust one other, as much as I trust PDJT.
I have looked hard, looked up close, and am confident KL is the real thing.
Ramaswamy is a consummate Wallstreet insider. He was groomed and financed via BigPharma and a series of shell corporations which funneled over a billion dollars into his war chest never producing a product or service.
.
Or — unlike Trump — ever doing anything notably charitable or in the public interest.
.
Well Ramaswamy did form a nonprofit social charity organization, Roivant Social Ventures (RSV).
oops…correction………………
Ramaswamy diverted part of the Roviant slush fund into Roivant Social Ventures.  RSV’s mission was to promote and fund DEI and ESG initiatives in the biopharma and biotech industries.
DAMN  sDee…    DOWN THE ” RABBIT HOLE ” i CRAWLED
Roivant IS FOCUSED on ” Much newer spin-offs include Immunovant, which was announced in July to focus on treating autoimmune disorders; Altavant, which was announced in June and aims to develop treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension; and Sinovant, announced in July, to focus on drug development in China. ”

( think i’LL Build Another COLD CELLAR )
Wow 😮!
Case closed for me without appeal on Vivek.
The case was closed for me, when it was disclosed he became rich, with the collusion of his physician mother, marketing a re-packaged failed drug for desperate seniors and their families.  Honesty is VERY important to me……I was raised to respect honor and honesty, and watching society accept what Is unacceptable is frustrating.
Being honorable is like being pregnant.  Either you is or you isn’t.
While your down there in the rabbit hole, consider that Roviant and its subsidiary Axovant raised their IPO money off an Alzheimer’s drug that had already failed clinical trials 4 times. GSK sold them the drug for peanuts.
Axovant owned the drug and took it clinical trial again,  where it failed again.  Shareholders lost everything.  “Fortunately”  Ramaswamy had moved his money back into Roviant before Axovant’s stock price collapsed.
i BELIEVE That  Vivek was ASKED About that Drug and He  Dismissed It as A INVESTMENT Venture that They Lost Money on.
YOU  KNOW –  Where YOU Can Make a POOR INVESTMENT and WRITE IT OFF

DON’T YOU Get to WRITE OFF      BAD INVESTMENTS ?

People are not investing 100 cents on the dollar to write off 39 cents.
Those shelved (me too) drugs are reasonably prevalent.  Big pharma shelves them when the returns no longer project to meet their return threshold.  Experienced Pharma folks buy them, take a different tack or look for new indications and make fabulous money, often shared with the original owner.
Don’t construe this for support for VR, who I view as pure snake oil huckster who’ll show his loony stripes eventually.
On that failed Alzheimer’s drug, he had his mother who is a doctor rework and rewrite one of those clinical trials to make it look as though it was effective.
Giving false hopes to families is beyond evil.
My stepfather died of Alzheimer’s and it was beyond devastating to watch the deterioration. Now throw in someone who sells you on a ‘miracle drug’….😡🤬🥵
So if this was about Real Estate, we’d say he got into the House Flipping business.
Because what he did was essentially the same exact thing but with a drug.
Lets let this sink in and ask ourselves if we really want to go down this road..
I agree that what he’s done should be illegal.
We don’t need to create a massive drug flipping economy now for cripes sake.
Do we really need to wonder if what we’ve just been prescribed is the new name and a new color of the old version that flunked several tests?
No the investors were bilked out of their money
If Bill Gates is involved with Vivek, 
Vivek is done.  That means Vivek is a poor judge of character.   
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
and his mom had her hands in the pharma thingy, too.  No more family dynasties. And no more ‘foreigners’ for POTUS.  The founding fathers had a reason for this….one being loyalty to America. The Constitution must be followed.

Amen. Vivek is all in on TTP – that benefits India greatly, his parents home country.
I, for one, am sick and tired of all these foreigners in our government that have strong ties to the country they were born in. When push comes to shove, which country will they choose? We shouldn’t have to find that out – it should not be an option. With all the people we have in our own country why do we need a foreigner in our government?
Remember a time when you knew how to spell most Americans last name….I do.
President Trump played the financial/tax games to his advantage as well. But to your point I would need  to hear more on his economic ideas. Having to to with trade, tariffs, taxes, banking system, FED, manufacturing…….He may have spoke on these and frankly I don’t care enough to go find out cause I look no further than Trump.
Pence never sounded like a true conservative to me, every word was wishy washy.   Time will tell if Vivek is sincere, but he certainly speaks well.
Watch the 2015 interview that quinn posted above to understand just how slick he is.  At the time of the interview he had to have known the drug would fail and that all those investing Axovant would lose their money.

Isn’t it sad that we are impressed with swamy’s intelligence and knowledge of issues? When compared to the other candidate excluding Trump, he looks like a genius. All candidates seeking office should have the same level of knowledge. Instead we get PC idiots and liars pushed on us.
Vivek Ramaswampy is a younger Obama.
Rishi Sunak

Sunak, made millions off Pharma after he promoted Moderna to the House of Commons…stock holder as he is.
Unelected, installed as Schwab’s appointed acolyte in Britain. Everything he has done (open borders) or hasn’t serves his globalist masters.

OH is not as smart….Not nearly.
Trump shouldn’t allow anybody around him.  They are all suspect.  Should just do it all himself. 🤡
Definitely shut down departments in the exec branch.
Yep. No need to go through those Senate nomination hearings for Cabinet members. Just leave those slots empty.
Send his Vice President on a four year around-the-world goodwill tour right after swearing in.

Hopefully Judus is in the middle east signaling fair catches for those cruise missiles the terrorists are throwing around.
talking to DS beauties…….
Positioned by whom? What evidence do you have that supports this statement?
WEF/Globalists
See above.  Not to hard to discover just follow his journey from Harvard and Yale, to Campus Ventures which co-opted IP from students, to Roviant, Axovant and RSV.  Then ask yourself who/what could align such a sequence of events.
Nonsense.
And SOH Johnson is great.
And, because SOH Johnson is so great, lets elevate the gut responsible, M. Gaetz to Gov of Fla. or even PDJT’ VP, and certainly give him the mantle of “the future of MAGA” ,…. NOT!
And major sarc.
There are people saying he is working for Trump, as well.
In addition to we need for PDJT to 1) actually secure the nomination and 2) win in November, before we get too serious about staffing his cabinet.
I NEVER trust a fast talker. Vivek has no record and like The Obomination, he’s a cipher.
Vivek would absolutely obliterate Obama in a debate. Literally, blood on the tracks.
But, I wouldn’t trust him any further than I can throw a good sized marmoset.
Cjzak is correct.
Anybody could best Obama in a debate. While he is stuttering out words with lots of hems and haws, the other person would be way down the road making his point.
Kari Lake exhibited such devastating debate skills, in squaring off with the media, that they gave her the title of “the most DANGEROUS politician in America” and both Karis primary and general election opponents refused to debate her, literally running away to avoid her.
And notice how she  although a ‘rising star’ in the MAGA movement (or perhaps BECAUSE she is a rising star in MAGA!) has entirely avoided this whole sh*tshow biggest loser primary contest, with debates?
She certainly COULD have put her hat in the ring, instead of announcing for Senate, and acted as a surrogate for PDJT, as many think VR is doing…
shhh,…
could beat O..
Don’t understand the fast talker thing.
I don’t trust a “slow talker”.  They are always thinking what should I say, versus the truth.
.
He is not interested in taking what, compared to the presidency, or being the multimillion dollar CEO of his own companies, is a lackey position.
.
Exactly.  There is nothing nefarious in that.
VR has done more to articulate the anti-left view than Trump, who constantly triangulates and equivocates in his speech (“now there are good people on both sides, and …”) and this is reflected in the people he surrounds himself with. I’ve never seen anyone who has so many good friends willing to stab him in the back and undermine him. There is a constant thread of naive trust in his approach to people.
And power to all of you who can sit through every single one of his rally speeches as they jump around between out-of-order half thoughts. But that’s not a show-stopper, he has the executive ability to get it done, though have never seen demonstration of the ruthlessness that will be required. Ability to wield executive authority without being a puppet of external forces is where Trump gets the nod.
VR is not presidential material, but great press secretary and would hand out master class whoopings daily. He seems to enjoy it.
Recall when Trump was his age, he was a pro-abortion rights NYC Democrat-voting playboy socialite.
.
Not responsive to my point.
Ramaswamy is not interested in taking what, compared to the presidency, or being the multimillion dollar CEO of his own companies, is a lackey position.
.
First paragraph is complete crap.  He is the first to very pointedly get to America(ns) first, call the media for the lying garbage heap it is and bust the deep state for its globalist designs.  The backstabbing thing is about power, politics and ds being littered with assholes and the Senate being the filter through which hires are made.
.
Yes.
.
IMO… Vivek is literally a snake – he’s a calculating, forked-tongue pHARMa snake… a slick-talking scammer;  smooth criminal.
He has demonstrated this character.
 “Crime, once exposed, has no refuge but in audacity.” ~ Tacitus
From the ‘don’t shoot the messenger’ dept.:
Consider this financial advisor’s viewpoint, who examined V’s successful business’ rise & fall by exposing the history of the  failed product & following the money moves, and spells it out; Vivek  was an insider who designed a scam (with insider family members) to get rich with built-in plausible deniability, & has zero compunction after the fact because he lies about it being “bad luck”… even though he did in fact walk away with the investments/windfall profits.  Apparently he means “bad luck for the investors”.
pHARMa & politics have this behavior pattern in common
{ conmed VIVEK a Multibillion Dollar FRAUD | Ft. Vivek Ramaswamy for President. – YouTube  }
AND the response from him/his spokesperson/campaign –
 remember… “Crime, once exposed, has no refuge but in audacity.” ~ Tacitus
{ConMed Vivek Response to Me [Spoiler: It’s BAD] – YouTube }
AND a NYT report on his big failure’s plausible deniability – IDK if this report comes from belief or desire to expose
{ ConMed Vivek Ramaswamy Made the Fortune Fueling His Presidential Run – The New York Times }
“… “That gave me the foundation to then go on to places like Harvard and Yale and become a scientist.”
With an undergraduate degree in biology from Harvard, Mr. Ramaswamy isn’t really a scientist; he made his name in the world of hedge funds and his graduate work was a law degree from Yale.
Along the way, he invested in biotech and became enamored with an idea for developing high-risk prescription drugs: scour the patents held by pharmaceutical giants, searching for drugs that had been abandoned for business reasons, not necessarily for lack of promise. Buy the patents for a song, and bring them to market….”
Imo, 4 failed trials (1st drug) does not indicate a drug has “promise”; to a company quite wealthy enough to construct experimental data to show any result wanted and reap profits until the illusion runs out (SOP)… that one was recognized as a dud and abandoned.
Vivek put lipstick and pearls on that pig. 
Of course he’s saying everything MAGA wants to hear… that’s specifically how con men garner Trust in their victims = it’s the set up for the robbery so the victim doesn’t see it coming and the scammer gets away with the goods before the victim knows they’ve been swindled. In this “presidential run” scenario, V is in it for the power/position so he can parlay his ill-gotten fortune/fame into something much more.  JMO.
Vivek was/is not honest about that “business”.  I don’t believe he can be trusted to be presenting himself & his intentions honestly now either.
I know people who don’t think Donald Trump is honest.
Perception is everything.

Episode 353: 1986: THE UNTOLD STORY (2:18:19)
The HighWire with Del Bigtree
Jan 4, 2024
In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act into Law, inadvertently setting the table for the pharmaceutical industry to become the most influential industry on earth. But that isn’t the whole story. Barbara Loe Fisher, a pioneer of the Vaccine Injury Awareness movement, was at the table, fighting for families and children as this controversial law took form. Listen to Barbara as she tells the untold story of the 1986 Act and how it came to be. Learn the betrayal that paved the way for vaccine manufacturers to secure immunity from liability for their products, opening the door for the complete capture of the agencies charged with regulating the vaccine industry and protecting the public trust.

“If the State can tag, track down and force individuals to be injected with biologicals of known and unknown toxicity today, then there will be no limit on which individual freedoms the State can take away in the name of the greater good tomorrow.” – Barbara Loe Fisher
“I hope you strive to develop your confidence because you *do* still have the legal right to reject vaccinations in this country…I encourage you to exercise those rights and develop them into a source of strength. The rights to freedom & choice are worth defending too. Exercise them, defend them, or those who would take them from us will have very little trouble doing so.”

Consider the Yellow-Gray map Sundance regularly posts, with Yellw for WEF countries (U.S., EU, 5 eyes, etc.) and Gray for BRICS+.
A map showing countries where a Drs Rx is required for a long list of meds in yellow, and Countries where no such requirement exists would be virtually the SAME.
Its NOT a coincidence, nor is it a coincidence that the same meds cost much less in gray countries, than in yellow.

2023 is in the review mirror…..getting smaller and smaller.
President Trump and his MAGA / AMERICA FIRST MOVEMENT have 3 solid years wrapped up.
Think back at how many times the bad guys shouted….”we got him this time”?
And they failed, over and over again …….they are battin’ zero and President Trump is battin’ a thousand!
What a bunch of “dumber-than-a-rock” losers …… Brandon and the democrats and the GOPe… the dopes deserve the rope.
January, 2024 sees the ongoing cleaning out of the local nest of election thieves to have honest primary and general elections. If you haven’t joined the effort, there is still time and plenty of work to wrap up in your area.
Winning the 2024 elections for America and President Trump will be the HUGE kick off of MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN.  
With the recommended “2024 Constitutional Republic Mandate” plank in his platform and his plans to immediately implement the de-naturalization and deportation of the illegals and faux citizens, the recapture of the federal government will be quickly accomplished by the President Trump Team. There will be some loose ends but there is no better executive nor negotiator than President Trump to to tie them down.
No brag, just fact. 7 proven years, and counting, of winning!
“Let’s go Brandon and the democrats and the GOPe!”
Nice post! 
I believe you are correct, the disgust with governments of western nations ( primarily the U.S.) as they lead the way because of their corporate power and military.
Is massive, one feels it and sees evidence of it daily.
Your RINOs may be the biggest hurdle, as politically speaking they will have few places to go.
I repeat to myself daily a quote posted here by a stellar contributor.
“ When nothing in society deserves respect.
   We should fashion for ourselves in solitude new silent loyalties “
While that can be interpreted in several ways, the choice I have made pleases me and benefits our family and dear friends greatly.
Cheers, and God Bless President Trump. ( a loyalty I am not silent about😉)
It was a good comment.
The Partisan – Leonard Cohen
ps Think about it, you never saw crooked biden take a 2020 election victory lap because he knew he didn’t win. 
His whole illegally certified, communist administration was one big cover-up of their 2020 cheating operation.
It all started with their IA planned and manned 1/6 scam to interrupt the “certification process” with the help of traitor pennnnncee.
The problem is the damage that has been done over the illegal occupation of the White House and the time it takes just to prove it is illegal.
The question is what is the punishment and who gets the punishment?
The answer is in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
And it’s not a pretty sight folks. But I see it through the lens of those who lost their lives or the lives of their loved ones and not ( forgive me Lord ) through Jesus’s eyes.
Public hangings served a purpose and I believe it originally meant, ” Thou shall not murder ”  not ” Thou shall not kill “.
Y’all have a blessed day!!
yes.
the commandment in the Torah reads “you shall not murder”.
i believe the original translation in Christianity is “thou shall not murder”.
“murder”  implies the untimely death of an innocent by another’s hand.
“killing” can be justified in certain circumstances, such as self-defense.
distinction with a difference.
That sleazebag took a victory lap with his edicts.  
Obama’s sorry ass did it with 1 trillion for his backers.  Rs stood idly by in each instance d.
we are still in this fight.  we are still a force to be respected. 
soo, it is my prayer request we convert this momentum into something truly magnificent….pleasing to God.  Deserving of great admiration and commendation.  
There is no finish line here.  There never is when you are dealing with vicious cultural and institutionalized corruption and evil.  So we have to accept these challenges and simply form a life strategy that envelopes our spirit in the body armor protections that can only come from God.  When we pray, and specifically, I do believe he provides this protection.  That is how I believe.  I also believe you don’t automatically “WIN” each battle.  It just doesn’t work that way.  Not when dealing with evil and corruption.  We have to get it right each and every time..this kind of enemy can get 100 things wrong and find that one thing that really damages society.  I believe this nation suffers from confidence.  The confidence that is required to look at this overall bleak image of society that sez:  we can solve this.   And will.
right now, there is a lack of confidence.  This confidence will be earned the old way.  through pain…and future organization of like minded people who will be faced with no other options than to just simply BECOME WHAT IS REQUIRED.
right now, there is not enough pain that “requires” change.  But it will come and it will be very difficult for millions of Americans who have never really experienced this kind of daily pain.  For those strong in their faith, will make all the difference.  Soon, we are going to see a major renewal of  communities to return to the church and become closer in fellowship in all the ways that matter.
I know I am reaching out to my friends an neighbors and making sure they understand that there IS A CHURCH WITH A PLACE SPECIAL FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.  It matters to say these things to people.  It gives people the promises that they can depend on.  In this way, WE ARE ASKING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  See how this works.  Local….right here, right now.  you and me.  The true white horses who are always here, and always will be to make

Another great comment, in a great thread.
I agree with the essence of Cactus’s comment, but also agree that assuming PDJT becomes #47, that will NOT be the end of the battle, it will just intensify the fighting.
And, along with an army of MAGADOSIANS going into D.C. to clean out the mess there, we REALLY need to complete the ongoing effort begun at the precinct level, to clean out by tagging and bagging, the State R parties, up to the State Executive Committee level.
THAT is the ONLY way, IMHO to ultimately secure honest elections, which we MUST have so that we can gey MAGA control over State Governments, SO THAT we can aggresively use 10A to cut down on Fed Govt. overreach “from the bottom up” even AS PDJT cuts it, from the top down.
Reminder that Epstein panic shipped a cement truck to fill In the tunnels and bury the evidence 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7361297/Jeffrey-Epstein-shipped-50K-cement-truck-Pedophile-Island-cover-evidence.html
.
Evidence of what? This is pure speculation. And kind of silly too. Why would Epstein want to cover up evidence he used via CIA for blackmail. What actually happened was that after his arrest (arguably contrary to his previous deal with the feds), the FBI raided his house in NYC, his island, and other properties, and removed all electronic devices and whoknows whatelse to protect other people.
.
Blood and semen from all over those underground rooms and caverns that were known to exist. 
That evidence.
.
Assuming this… in and of itself, that wouldn’t hurt Epstein. He didn’t force politicos and celebrities at gunpoint to go to his properties and events.
.
What about aiding and abetting, accessories before and after the fact, human trafficking, false imprisonment, obstruction of Justice, evidence tampering, witness tampering?
A lawyer, like you, should know this. 
You sure do seem to be defending Epstein. 
Why is the question.
.
I’m not “defending” him. I just think the speculation about why he would have one cement mixer brought to the property is… ridiculously over the top. Additionally, I am remembering that he had an overt deal with the feds for no more prosecutions so how credible is it that suddenly — weeks before his arrest that he didn’t know was coming, instead of preserving dead man’s switch — he tries to cover up evidence that would implicate honchos whose interests would be in preventing him from being placed into a position of having to defend himself and “out” them.
.
He removed the blackmail tapes. 
The physical evidence would have made him exposed and liable. 
That overt deal was a 53 page indictment that went away with complete  immunity for himself, 4 other (unknown) named co-conspirators and any future unnamed persons involved. 
He was slapped on the wrist. 
His attorney was DERSHOWITZ, who has been repeatedly named in the documents. 
When USA Acosta was called out about it later, his reply was that he was told Epstein was “an intelligence asset, above his pay grade and to leave it alone.
Lastly, though not confirmed, several seemingly credible sources claimed at the time that in the caverns below the house, not only was there sex stuff, but satanic ritual murders taking place. 
If all of this is not enough, I don’t what else to say.
Remember when “pizzagate” first made the news, and was ‘debunked’ as a crazy conspiracy theory?
Only to subsequently be confirmed.
Now I have seen several different stories of human sacrifice by wealthy elites, in europe too.
A) For those addicted to power, homicide IS the ultimate excercise of power.
B) Like pedophilia, its the ultimate thing to “hold over” someone, as blackmail or initiation in order to assure “loyalty” as the Mafia with the “making his bones” initiation.
So, I believe its REAL  and will eventually come out.
I think the Epstein Island story is being played up to obscure the bigger story of what was really going on.
The mann did not get rich enough to own an island and a NYC townhouse and a private jet off of the trivial amount og hush money politicians etc. could afford to pay him.
Who did he work for?
Whom did he work for? Answer (as if we didn’t already know)–Mossad/MI6/CIA/deep state.
The bread crumbs and details are provided by Daryl Cooper in his Martyrmade Substack three-part series on Epstein and his place in the decades-long endeavors of power-politics human trafficking/sex trade.
https://www.martyrmade.com/featured-podcasts/the-jeffrey-epstein-series
The details are stomach-turning. But if you have a strong stomach, begin  with the first episode. 
Take-away: everything you feared is true . . . and much worse  . . . and . . . well, the Belgian/Euro version of the Epstein scandal provides a peek (well-documented) into what goes on  in the dungeons.
Exactly.
Clarion, did you watch the video someone posted on the Epstein thread a couple of days ago?  I think that might answer some of your questions.  He was involved with a billionaire named Wexman (I think that was his name) who transferred a lot of his wealth to Epstein to include one of his jets.  According to the video they were both working for Mossad who supposedly disposed of Wexman as soon he was no longer of use to them.  
I’ll see if I can find it.
I was to some extent mistaken. Wexner was involved and did give Epstein a lot of valuable things, but it was Maxwell (Ghislaine’s father) who was the big deal spy with Mossad and also fell off his yacht and drowned, a suspected elimination by Mossad. I found the video on the first page of the Epstein thread but it won’t let me repost it.

Yes it does seem a stretch.   Having a small concrete mixer like that does not seem unusual.  It is  difficult to do any form of efficient modern construction without concrete.  Even if only a few miles offshore, ferrying out a load of fresh mixed concrete is VERY expensive.  Who knows how expensive on a remote island.
.
For all we know he was building a bbq pit or a new sidewalk.

Then why did he pay for it up front assuming all liability in transit to rush it (expedite) there 3 weeks before he KNEW it was going to be raided?

DAILY MAIL – JAN 04 2024
Epstein list reignites suspicion the pedo financier was working for Mossad and blackmailing the elite with help of ‘useful idiot’ Prince Andrew – after meeting Israeli PM Ehud Barak at least THIRTY SIX times
Ehud Barak named in tranche of documents unsealed overnight in defamation case against Epstein’s madam Ghislaine Maxwell
Former intelligence operatives including ex Mossad agent Ari Ben-Menashe claimed that Epstein was a spy for Israel who used relationship with ‘useful idiot’ Prince Andrew to mine information 
[…]Former Israeli spies have gone on record stating that Epstein’s international sex trafficking was a honeypot entrapment operation – gaining valuable ‘kompromat’ material to blackmail political and business elites.
[…]At the time of his suicide, Epstein’s fortune was around $580 million although it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact sources of his massive wealth, inciting further conjecture that it may have come from shadowy sources.
Following his death, the FBI raided his $51 million Manhattan townhouse and found a cache of evidence from a safe including loose diamonds and large amounts of US currency.
They did not have a warrant to remove the items at the time but when they went back to retrieve them, they had gone missing The Telegraph reports.

The thing is, when they say “Mossad” and people equate that with being the Israeli Govt. thats like saying CIA and equating it with the U.S. Govt.
Globullusts have No “Loyalty” to the Govt. of ANY one Nation, and so if Globullusts get into positions within a Government, including in Intel. they have no loyalty to that nation, their loyalty is to the One World Government ideology  and to those who are fellow “true believers” regardless of what Nation they ostensibly represent.
But the ICs are the government. 
Thru the blackmail, they control the politicians and officials of their respective countries on behalf of the Globalist elites

Cause of Climate Change? It Isn’t Carbon Dioxide, Expert Says
Many people think that it is “rising carbon dioxide that is the main factor … that affects climate change, and that is wholly untrue,” scientist Willie Soon says. According to Soon, the sun is a key source of climate change.
https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/01/04/causes-climate-change/
What temperature should the planet be?
1 degree cooler than what ever it is.  
Unless, of course, the WEF decides global cooling is the real threat. Then the temperature of the planet should be 1 degree warmer than whatever it is.

my god man, it is going to rain today and then stop raining!  can we please stop making energy already

Don’t know, but if they were going to take the earths temperature anally, I know where they would stick the thermometer.
It spends a lot of time (hundreds of millions of years) at an average global temperature of 22 degrees C, if you look at the record for the last 600 million years.
Where are we now??
14.2 degrees C.
Don’t know about you, but I cheerfully light my wood stove to help the trees.

And I cheerfully drive my gas car (in winter, it’s a Subaru) that cranks out the CO2 exhaust, except the price of gasoline is killing my wallet.  Yes, the summer car is a diesel, which gets almost twice the mileage, but what’s the root of the word ‘conservative?’
Conserve.  I don’t take it to extremes, but I try to tread lightly on the world.  We only have one, and it’s a beautiful (if cold right now) planet.

Just flippin’ do it already!!!
…and while you are at it, shut everything down until we put our military on every square inch of the border.
the fascists must be shaking in their boots now… we’ve moved from EVALUATING to CONSIDERING something….
He’ll be in serious trouble now.

I assume it’s obvious, but I shouldn’t.
…And when you’re done with that, you can proceed to the next task.  Arrest cup Holder – who is also in contempt of congress ….
Are they evaluating or considering writing sternly worded letters, yet?
So, hows that Speaker Johnson working out for ya, now?
Here’s a story about the other end of unlimited border crossings.  Maria Gonzales Ruis Hernandez is asking for help because she is about to be evicted with her two children.
Maria has had her section 8 apartment for a few years and her rent is 145.00 (section 8, so paid by US taxpayers, except for the 145 that she is supposed to pay). She currently owes 3000.00 hence the eviction and she wants help because of course she can’t pay 3000 and she has children so we can’t let her be evicted.
Citizens can’t get section 8, the application process is closed.  That’s right, flat out closed, you can not even apply and be on a waiting list.
Why Maria has not already been evicted, I do not know but I know she finally has an eviction notice.
We can not feed and house the people we already have and the people Bite Me’s inviting in are here to live free.  Cloward Piven on steroids.
The tipping point has not even begun to be reached.
Not sure I understand….her rent is 145? That means she is in arrears of about 20 months? Something is very wrong with this. Well, she can get evicted then arrested for child neglect…the kids to to the authorities and then a foster home and she goes to jail….everyone has a roof over their head. Problem solved? Of course there is deportation….maybe Catholic Charities will pay her bills?
My guess is the Covid eviction moratorium kept her there all this time, and now that’s ended.
That’s right.
There is no more moratorium and the eviction letters are everywhere.
However as someone mentioned whoever or whatever is the sponsoring agency (one of the pigs at the trough), they are settling the jumpers in section 8 housing.  Citizens can’t get section 8.  And then food stamps and medicaid.  Probably more than we can imagine.
The problem is that at some point the apartment complex wants to be paid and the jumper can’t figure out what the big deal is, they’ve been living free for months/years.
Now Maria needs 3000 for rent and who knows how much for a car repair and she expects someone to pay it.  The local church based charity was going to pay it (eye roll) but the total needed was too large.  Maria definitely is not paying taxes, none at all, we do not have a sales tax.
We have plenty of homeless and no one bats an eye but when these jumpers start getting evicted, it’s going to get ugly.
Nah, she just needs to go down to the border with her kids.
Cross over into Mexico, turn around, and cross back.
Except if she has section 8, she has probably been photographed and catalogued in their database for photo recognition.
I know for a fact applicants for Food Stamps are.
Too bad, otherwise her and two kids could get $5000, airfare or busride anywhere in the country, and to the head of the line for public housing.
So, not only are they pissing off blacks (presumably African American CITISENS) they are now pissing off long time illegals, by pushing both out of the way in order to welcome these new illeg,….”Migrants” .
Wonder how many of them wish they’d stayed home in Mexico by now.
According to my math, Maria has not paid her share of her rent for over 20 months.
Is “a few years” two years?
Who is her sponsor?
How much “other Federal and State assistance” (welfare) is she getting?
Sounds like a candidate for Deportation to me.
I don’t remember voting to willingly pay for foreigners to come here and live off my tax money.
Reminds me of this……

Cox Media Group was recently exposed for promoting its ability to eavesdrop on private conversations via the microphones on cell phones and smart devices, and to use that information to sell targeted advertising.
Specifically, CMG boasted of its ability to engage in “Active Listening” on behalf of advertisers, so that “the whispers of consumers become a tool for you to target.”

Great revelation
Scary as hell.  Maybe forcing us to rid ourselves of smartphones and listening devices. 
Imagine what the government is / has been doing to us.
I’ve suspected this for years. 
Here’s another one I suspect:
If you have cable or Wi-Fi TV, they can listen in and/or visually see you even when it’s off if hooked to a power source. 
WiFi and fiber optics- light energy (physics). 
If images and audio can be sent, they can also be ‘retrieved.’
I’m certain that’s true.  Hell Roku TVs record snaps of what youre  watching (x times per second) and report it. You have to actively turn it off.
I have a story to tell about that.  I had a Samsung big tv in my bedroom.  I kept it off most of the time, yet I heard it turn on (woke me up) in the middle of the night and apparently when there was nothing to see or hear, it turned off.  After that happened several nights in a row, I gave the darn thing away.  This is a true story and I ain’t joking.  I hate these people.
And if corporations are so brazenly open about using all our smart devices as listening tools, then it stands to reason that their full partners in the Intelligence Community are also doing the same — but not for ad revenue.

How likely are they using internet routing protocols? Not like we are not being bombarded with internet connectivity to everything. See also the Internet of Things (IoT) as a concept.
Just imagine what all that data traffic being picked up by deep packet inspection and other network analysis tools on your local network within your home what you will find.
.
What they find is 99.8% innocuous contacts to a person, using way too much energy resources in doing so, in order to try to connect that .2% to something that they believe  has some nefarious intent . . .
Not a great return on investment unless the government steps in to help offset storage of 99.8% of ‘nothing’ . . .
Cost is no object when you are paying with other people’s money (OPM).
Still though, how exactly is that all supposed to work if continuing with all the green new deal crud is going to crash the electric grid that underlies all of it?
.
Oopsie. 
Someone didn’t think far enough ahead . . .
This is the real reason for pushing for higher levels (5g) and I can verify the stated reason of increasing connection speeds in rural areas is hogwash.
I am in a rural area, using 4g, and its working fine.
More bandwidth is to handle them collecting more data on US.
When you find out you are being bugged, whether its for State sponsored intel, or industrial intel, or political or even this,…consumer intel, the dumb thing to do is to remove/disable or smash the bug.
The smart thing to do is to take advantage of the fact that you know your being bugged, but they don’t know that you know.
Know-I’m-sayin,….?
i’ve had more live examples of the listening than i care to admit – and i am definitely operating on the assumption that everything i say with a phone in the same room is heard by the fascists.
you can call me paranoid, but i guarantee some of the s*t i say has me “on their radar.”
and i really don’t give a damn anymore.

In delivering aid to “the poor” throughout recent years, and at times visiting what I will politely call their domiciles, I have these thoughts:
If you are poor and need food, where did the money come from…
…to get hundreds if not thousands of dollars in tattoos (which are a waste and idiotic for anyone)…
…to get hundreds if not thousands of dollars in piercings (which are a waste and idiotic for anyone)…
…to become obese, in some cases, massively obese…
…to fill your apartment/house with smoke from tobacco or marijuana (also a waste and idiotic)…
…to fill your trash can with emptied bottles of gin, whiskey, etc. (also a waste and idiotic)…
…to be on pills or some other drug, as proven by your face, teeth, and bombed out or buzzed behavior (ditto)…
…???
We know that the money comes from the FedGov  (i.e. us) or from crime (i.e. us)  or possibly from legitimate employment. 
Societies have always had a constant percentage of not very bright people, of average people, and above average people.
The goal in America and Modern Western Civilization in general used to be the raising of the not very bright to near average, and the raising of the average to above average, and pushing the above average to even higher achievement.
This goal – derived from Christianity’s idea of rebirth and renewal and personal improvement (“Go and Sin no more!“) – seems to have been lost in recent decades, thanks to the pernicious goal of Communism/Socialism for equality, which is defined as keeping people mediocre and penalizing any achievement, since achievement in the views of Communists/Socialists is injurious to Equality and must be penalized.
And so, we see ever more “stupid stuff” being pushed and lionized as “great” and “genius.”
Taylor Swift is not a musical genius: strutting around and doing a bump-and-grind on a stage while chanting unmusical, unpoetic doggerel on a note or two can not be classified as genius.
Bob Dylan is neither a musical nor a poetic genius: mumbling doggerel and strumming chords on a geetar do not make you a genius.
Banksy is not an artistic genius: defacing public buildings with agitprop does not make you Michelangelo or Duerer!
Stephen King is not a literary genius: in this case, he at least admits it, saying that he writes “cheeseburgers” i.e. something meant to be consumed, enjoyed, relieved of, and forgotten a day or two later.
Spending money for their concert tickets or CD’s or “artworks” or books supports things which should not be supported.
Our popular culture used to have at least a modicum of space for the idea that people should develop their tastes to higher levels: now the kulcheral gurus advise us that worthless fuzz is the most expensive silk.
Such deliberate exaltation of the mundane, the mediocre, and the culturally miasmic explains the rise of so many schnooks in modern-day politics, who, despite their lack of logical thought, are not so intellectually stunted that they are unable to enrich themselves at our expense.  
This lionizing of under-achieving also explains the rise of intelligent but evil people who are willing to lie and manipulate the unthinking mediocrities around us for their own power and enrichment.
President Donald Trump as president again will not be able to counter such a “kulcheral” Leviathan alone: his presidency will be an obstacle to it, but we need a much larger 21st-century Cultural Renaissance, where idiocy is not genius, where mediocrity is not tolerated, and where true geniuses are allowed to succeed and prosper, rather than drowned in the detritus from Hollywood and Madison Avenue.
ppl are literally dying from the mundane.
And may I add—where did you get those nails lacquered and  those hair extensions done??
Oh yes!  The list above is hardly complete: the catalogue of vanities and inanities nears the infinite!

Look at it this way; by their indictments against PDJT, they are making it clear that should he lose the battle for the Oval office, he will lose everything; wealth, business, freedom.
So, he’s got “nothing to lose” and so no reason NOT to release the 11″ think unredacted file THEY acknowledge they know “disappeared” (i.e. that PDJT HAS).
To release it NOW is to be charged with “illegally” disclosing classified info, much as earlier to release it would have opened himself up to being charged with obstructing either the Mueller or Durham investigations.
IF PDJT is not declared the winner in Nov. he and we KNOW that THEY will go after him and us with “everything they’ve got”,…except if PDJT has “nothing to lose” than he has no reason to NOT release it.
The currency in D.C. is blackmail material, and PDJT has the bank.
Wish we could kick them out of the country.

has she ever explained why a “win” for russia (i.e. having to sacrifice thousands of their own to protect themselves) is a LOSS for the former republic of the USA?

JAN 05 2024 – New Zealand –
A video of a powerful speech by New Zealand’s Member Of Parliament is going viral on social media. 
21-year-old Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke is New Zealand’s youngest MP in 170 years. 
She performed the traditional indigenous  ‘war cry’ in her first speech
More power to her.
I don’t get this war cry thing.  They all live on a little island down at the bottom of the earth.  Nobody hears them.
Can’t name 3 of the provinces she thinks it SO important to protect.
Probably calls Italy “the boot one, you know!”
Birdbrain is a pretty obvious hint she is a mental midget. 
Nikki is not the Conservative Inc. version of Hillary, so much as their version of Karmala.
The last thing I want is Americans standing in bread lines as our Congress spends and prints $$$ until those dollars are MORE worthless than they already are!  We’re BROKE Nikki … deal with it!  I’m sick and tired of PAYING for Ukraine’s corrupt government.  
How about repatriating all those millions of Ukrainians who cowardly FLED from Slava Ukrania?  Put them to work … put them on the front lines.
Nikki … you SUCK!
Of course she does…she a professional panderer.
I thought it was professional FELLATOR, after all kenji said “You SUCK” not “you stand on a streetcorner, begging for $..”

Trump’s peace deal would have prevented war and prevented further Russian aggression.
A win-win for everybody.
Trumps peace deal would have prevented war by preventing U.S. led NATO aggression against Russia, forcing Putin, after yrars of restraint, to respond.
In fact, unconstrained by the neocons he would have found common ground with putin in many areas, including working against CCP hegemony.
Giving away our weapons and breaking our bank is about making sure war comes to us, and that we lose that war.
Yes, its flipping “Economic security is national security” and “walk/talk softly and carry a big stick” and somaking us MORE rather than less likely to be forced to defend ourselves.
Computer security experts at DEF CON, the world’s largest computer hackers conference, have discovered several vulnerabilities with ES&S’s EPBs. The computer security experts learned:
.
ES&S’s EPBs could be hacked using a preprogrammed three- or six-digit password installed by the manufacturer.
.
A hacker can access the Microsoft Windows software installed on the EPBs and turn on a video game.
.
ES&S installed remote access software on its EPBs which diminishes the safety protections of the machine’s firewalls and makes the machines vulnerable to hackers.
.
ES&S’s EPBs have USB ports built into its mounting stand without any physical locks or mechanical support for tamper-evident seals, which could be accessed by voters or poll workers.
.
ES&S’s EPBs can be booted using the external USB port and USB memory stick. This means a malicious attacker could freely access data on the device by bypassing the system’s defenses, and run custom software, including software that could extract, change, or delete voter registration data stored on the machine.

Real nice, MP!
The machines!  AND, as Dutch says, the people manipulating them!
When the mail-in ballots and ballot mules are just not enough..
Exactly. “Insurance”
A couple of hackers already demonstrated, in a live stream, how rhey parked down the street from a polling location, in Maracopa county, during the primary.
They established a wi-fi hotspot, and connected with the coffee machine, sitting NEXT TO the voting machine tabulator.
(The coffee machine can advise the vendor when itvis getting low in consumables, so it can be restocked).
They then instructed the cofee machine to make a blu-tooth connection to the election machine, and got as far as the “handshake” (where goung any further would have been a violation of the law) thereby destroying the false narrative that voting machines are not or can not be accessed by the I-NET.
in a (very) former life i attended a couple defcons in vegas…. 
i would be very skeptical of the ideological nonsense these days that permeates everything and would probably have changed the complexion and integrity, but back then that was entirely irrelevant: if someone made ANY declaration that X could not be done/hacked/broken, they considered it a personal affront to their intelligence… and it was ALWAYS done by the end of the conference.  in fact they usually reserved time in the closing wrap-up specifically for these announcements, knowing they would come.
ES&S?
EPB?
Sounds like Election related computers.  But not everybody knows the acronyms.
Two main election machine companies; Dominion and ES&S.
Its all the same software, only modified as needed to work with the specific hardware.
There are other “lesser” companies, but all are essentially the same.
LOTS of $ being spent on voting machines, with State officials making the decusions to spend FEDERAL $, that doesn’t come out of State budgets, at all.
Therefore, lots of temptation,..

It seems to me that President Trump should couple the 2020 election with J6.
What was the Root Cause of J6:
   There was tons of evidence of fraud and corruption in the 2020 election-Recent released Summary
   Voters were completely frustrated that the DOJ, local election managers, courts would not allow investigations
   Voters met on J6 to protest the corrupt election and to get the certification delayed for 10 days so investigations
      Could occur in certain states-A legal process
So the whole reason for the J6 rally was because the voting systems/processes in the 2020 election in many states were corrupted as documented, but the government organizations that are supposed to make sure elections are fair did not care.
Federal law that states must conform to in federal elections:
so the reason for J6 was because government institutions didn’t do their job not because of President Trumps speech. They are to blame, not he voters or the protesters.
How about the federal law that states before the election could be certified the voter rolls of the state must be accurate. Pence and senate did NOT follow the law.
Many naively think that below the Supreme Court layer of judiciary, judges coldly interpret the law. Reality is that judges, especially the most ambitious ones on right and left, are building a “platform” for party appointments into higher courts.

After Claudine Gay’s resignation, Associated Press complains that the incident “highlights” a “new conservative weapon against colleges: plagiarism”
EUGYPPIUS
Claudine Gay has resigned her Harvard presidency following extensive allegations of academic impropriety. She and her enormous glasses of racial understanding must return to the faculty, where they will lurk for years to come like a very expensive bad smell. 
Gay was appointed as the first-ever black president of America’s wealthiest and most selective university, in a “historic first for people of color.” Alas, her presidency has turned out to be a first in other respects as well. For example, she will go into the history books as the first-ever Harvard president to have resigned after just six months in office. Womp womp.
https://www.eugyppius.com/p/after-claudine-gays-resignation-associated?r=9damc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web
Clarion: Yeah, because no one in academia has ever been accused of plagiarism before Claudine Gay.
Ha !   You can’t be fired for plagiarism if you don’t steal another’s work.  Do your own scholarship work and get promoted…NOT FIRED !
That USED TO BE THE STANDARD.  Now, studying hard and doing original research is “acting white.”  
Be lazy, don’t study and steal others’ work and call it your own. 
It’s like looting because the thief is just taking what he/she DESERVES  and IS OWED (reparations) because of what happened to the ancestors!
When will the elites learn that hiring “people of color” will come back to bite them in the butt.  One of the worst and most evil presidents in American history was “a person of color.”

WHICH  university or college is THIS ONE  going to get an President’s Office  in ?
That’s why the government won’t get out of the student loan business, even though it is harming many Americans.
They want the schools to be able to overcharge as many people as possible, to keep those post-retirement university gigs as lucrative as possible.
That’s why you only hear talk of “loan forgiveness” and no long-range solutions. If the government doesn’t get out of Higher Ed, the con will continue.
I used to trust everything a lot.  The last few years have really changed my thinking.
On reading about this latest Republican resignation, my first thought was, who’s blackmailing these congresscritters to leave so they can be replaced by Democrats?
Somebody gets to new congresscritters very quickly after they get to Washington DC.
A letter to the editor today from a reader inside the fence in The People’s Republic of Boulder suggesting that Democrats dump Biden because he cannot beat Nikki Haley –
Democrats need to keep options open in the primaries
Boulder is loaded with Democratic primary voters. I am the first to acknowledge that President Biden has had many good policies and some have been very successful. However, right now, despite her gaffs, Nikki Haley is polling 17 points ahead of Biden. If Trump is knocked out, likely only if there is a criminal conviction, she would crush Biden in the general election. Even with modest coattails, she could bring along enough congressmen and senators to eliminate the Democratic party as a viable political force for years or even decades to come. We do not know how things will unfold, but for self preservation, the Democrats need to keep their options open.

https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-01-04-statins-mitochondrial-toxins-linked-to-heart-disease.html
FTA “They are widely prescribed as a solution for clogged arteries, but statin drugs actually accelerate coronary artery calcification, according to a new study.
Research published in the journal Clinical Pharmacology reveals that statins are more aptly described as “mitochondrial toxins” in that they impair normal muscle function in the heart and blood vessels by depleting the body of coenzyme Q10, also known as CoQ10.
An antioxidant that cells use for growth and maintenance, CoQ10 does not synthesize properly when a person takes statins as prescribed by doctors to prevent heart disease, which is said to be the leading cause of death in the United States.”
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/kjm2.12373
The Dutchman was right!!!
They were pushing the statins hot and heavy, for virtually everyone over 40, for a while there.
Fundamentally, doctors (especially “heart doctors”) want you to be taking prescription drugs “forever.” (They especially like to prescribe statins to then-healthy young people, mumbling something about “bad cholesterol” even though your body synthesizes cholesterol.) They attribute the very debilitating long-term effects to “old age” and tell you to be glad that you’re not already in a cemetery. One of my uncles was “diagnosed” with heart disease and given a laundry-list of prescriptions – and he ignored every single one of them. Lived to be a ripe old age, thanks no-thanks to his doctors and thanks very much to his brain.
That happened to me. I went to the doctor for an annual which I used to never do and never did again after this. They said I had high cholestoral and was going to prescribe me statins to which I said “well I am not going to take them” and then she said well we will recheck you in 30 days and if it’s still high I will still prescribe them. When I went back my cholestoral was fine because I took a lot of whatever supplements to lower it. But regardless I am not taking medication unless I am in severe pain or a real life or death situation. Not going to take anything on the daily if I can help it. I once read a doctor report that is about 70 pages long that described how they keep changing the number of what is considered to be “high” cholestoral so that they can keep people on meds. NO thanks! I don’t trust doctors!

For those who are wondering how to handle things with gold, silver, bitcoin, outside a government regulated CBDC system that a lot of people think will be imposed on everyone, this man, George Gammon, is going to do a trip from Columbia to Argentina (with himself, Doug Casey and others) and only spend silver, gold, or bitcoin, to see what happens, what pitfalls and what successes such a trip and life would be like in the real world.
 They will be livestreaming, tweeting from the road, showing just how hard, or easy, living outside the system will be.
The trip, or caravan, will begin in April; 
here’s his you tube video on this planned trip, which seems to be growing in size, and interest.  He plans to livestream, and tweet, the trip and is now getting feedback from others that perhaps some people, who also want to experience how this might work in the real world, can join in for parts of the trip, in a caravan type experiment.
Wow. 
Bessie, if you follow this, would you consider giving us updates from time to time?
Yes, will post link(s) once they begin the journey; sometime in April is the plan at this time but if and when it begins will do that.
Hmmmm, traveling with gold and silver and making it known. Good luck to him.
Agree; will be a life lesson for sure not only for them, if they aren’t robbed, and for us who will be watching what happens!

Wherever you see DEI in academia, you also see talk of stolen land and decolonization. Always.
Decolonization ultimately means killing people viewed as ‘colonizers’ or ‘settlers.’ This is what it means in Israel, and what it means in USA. When some student or professor announces he stands on stolen Native American land in need of decolonization – it’s a call for murder.
They decolonized Zimbabwe with a lot of murder. Seems to be part of the plan in South Africa too. When you talk about decolonization you’re saying a group of people has no right to be somewhere, and if they don’t want to leave on their own – you take it a step further.

I used to work for a University and did computer work for several departments that provided Tutors and skilled people to help students with Academic Skills (study habits, financial tips, finding resources etc.) To be honest, a lot of these people were taking advantage of employee discount to pursue higher degrees so turnover wasn’t unusual but some were “lifers”. Of course they all had their pronouns listed on their emails ( along with their “Safety Zone training” with the rainbow emblem). Anyway, this one woman was hired and after a month it was clear that if you wanted an office party, she was your go-to. Intelligent conversation…not so much. Not terrible long after being hired, she replaced her pronouns with an announcement that the University she worked for was sitting on stolen Indian land. She left before I did but I always wondered how someone that stupid could seriously think something like that was OK…🤷‍♂️

Same old tricks during Obama’s time as well…put out fake good numbers initially, then revise them down later when no one will report on it.  I seem to remember the opposite was happening during Trump 1.0.  🤔🤔🤔
So do I…one “rule” for one, one for another.
Their aggregate numbers were predictable, but absolutely brutal.
15-page pdf filing by President Trump’s attorneys asking the Court to hold the prosecutors (Smith, et.al.) in contempt of court:
https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148.192.0.pdf
never happen.  court judges used to be attorneys.
Not sure it matters.  This will add to the appeals process once they do whatever damage they try to do.
They will all lose on appeal.
This is the LEFT.  “The process is the punishment.”
Except, in THIS case, its backfiring, and the process is actually the exoneration.
First off these lawfare Court cases, were brought primarily to actually argue, fight and ultimately win, not in lefal courtrooms, but in the Court of Public Opinion.
And in that effort, the juries verdict is in, and both opinion polls, and more accurate DONATIONS (giving their verdict with their wallets) the American people have issued their verdict.
Second, ancillary goal of this lawfare effort, was to build a case for denying PDJT the nomination, both with the indictments, and the equally without legal merit made for media “efforts” to keep him off the ballot; ALL designed and orchestrated to try to give a semblance of legitimacy, to PDJT NOT being the R nominee, and because of it dependance on the first point above, is likewise failing.
But wait, theres MORE.
In the Court of Public opinion (and ultimately in the legal courts) it is, and willbe made obvious that to charge PDJT with election interference, they HAVE to give him the opportunity to present evidence if election irregularies as an affirmative defence.
In other words, after 3 years of successfully blocking legal cases that would enable him to pur the evidence of election fraud in 2020 before the American people AND the courts, they are now bringing a case which absolutely guarantees he will be able to prevent such evidence.
But wait, theres MORE!
HE HAS the ‘classified’ evidence, in unredacted form, that details the muh Russia coup attempt.
While Mueller was ongoing, and then Durham, he was blocked from releasing it, as it would open up “Obstruction of Justice” Impeachment.
And after, because of them promoting the absurd notion that Executive agencies, that derive their authority over National Security FROM delegated Presidential authority, can actually dictate TO the President on decisions OF National Security, including classification of documents.
And, here again what are these prosecutions doing?
Bringing a case which will, inevitably eventually give us a SCOTUS ruling disabusing this rediculous notion, and freeing PDJT to release the info, INTO THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, any time he wants and without restrictions.
I really like this line of thinking. Especially those little, “but wait, there’s more…”
Let’s hope all this comes to fruition.
Go on and hug that Tar Baby, granny garland and crazy jack. Go ahead on.
I feel like adding a bit to your second point of denying Trump the R nomination. As Sundance talked about in an earlier article about the Obama team getting behind Haley and telling Democrats to vote for her. 
It seems while we are distracted by the Lawfare efforts against Trump and the ballot blocking by certain officials and states, the real effort is getting bills through all states to have open primaries so once those are in place the Democrats will “vote” in Haley for the the GOPe nomination and the R establishment will have a convenient excuse to say “The voters have spoken and the Party will therefore leave Trump to suffer the consequences of his and his followers actions”.
Once that is done, officials and states will unilaterally declare Trump ineligible to be either a write-in or independent candidate. Maybe I’m totally crazy or paranoid but that’s what I’m feeling is really going on. I’ll go back to praying that I’m wrong.
