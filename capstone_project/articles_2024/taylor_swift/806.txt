The divisional playoff game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills lived up to the hype, and the result was a new ratings record for the NFL.
CBS on Tuesday revealed that the game had an average audience of 50.393 million viewers. Additionally, the game peaked at more than 56 million.
It was the most-watched divisional playoff game ever for the NFL across all networks. The network also added that it was the league’s most-watched game since Super Bowl LVII between the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.

For those who watched the game, it was clear to see why it garnered such an audience. It was the third time quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen faced one another in the playoffs — this time for a trip to Baltimore to take on the Ravens in the AFC Championship. Both star QBs played well, and the game came down to a stunning missed field goal by Bills kicker Tyler Bass.
What’s also noteworthy about the ratings is the fact that it’s become clear Taylor Swift is not hurting the NFL. The pop star’s high-profile relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been one of the biggest stories of the 2023-24 season, and she’s attended a handful of games. While some have complained about broadcasts frequently cutting to shots of her in the suite — and others even outright blaming her for the team’s struggles — it hasn’t had a negative effect on the public’s desire to watch.
If anything, the impressive ratings the Chiefs achieved throughout the season could be viewed as confirmation for the league to keep it up.
