Just call it the Snooper Bowl!
Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre will team to host a Super Bowl afterparty on Feb. 11 in Las Vegas that will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Snoop’s Dre-produced hit, “Gin and Juice,” Page Six has exclusively learned. 
Diplo is set to DJ the party, we hear, at Wynn Las Vegas’ Encore Beach Club. Insiders are describing it as the night’s “biggest” bash. 
The game’s halftime performer, Usher, is expected to be a guest of honor at the festivities.
The event will also serve as an album release celebration for Usher’s latest studio project, “Coming Home,” which drops Feb. 9, we hear.
Organizers are keeping details, and the guest list, under wraps. But we hear Flipper’s Roller Boogie Palace co-founders Liberty Ross and Kevin Wall are producing the event, and singer-songwriter Hardy will also perform.  
Organizers are also teasing, “a special surprise that you won’t want to miss.”
Chef Sarah Thompson of Casa Playa will provide Mexican fare, and a raft of sponsors have signed on –including Bud Light, Ketel One Vodka and Don Julio Tequila. 
Usher is no stranger to rolling skating parties by Flipper’s. 
He hosted the Flipper’s Rolling Boogie Palace’s Rockefeller Center opening in NYC back in 2022, which brought out stars such as like Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Jermaine Dupri, Michael Strahan, Floyd Mayweather and Meek Mill. 
The R&B crooner was the leader of several impressive dance moments throughout the night… Perhaps, guests will get a second halftime show at this afterparty? 
Page Six has reported that Taylor Swift could be among celebs to make it to the big game — if she jets in from her tour in Japan to see her beau, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs go up against the San Francisco 49ers. 
Dre, Snoop, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Kendrick Lamar played the Super Bowl in 2022.
