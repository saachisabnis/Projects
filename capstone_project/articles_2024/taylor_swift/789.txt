NEW YORK CITY (TMX) -- A Seattle man accused of stalking Taylor Swift and loitering outside her New York City residence has been charged with harassment, per reports.
David Crowe, 33, was arrested Monday after Swift’s security team and neighbors reported he was loitering on the block where Swift lives, asking passersby whether the Grammy winner lives there.
“Officers were approached by multiple complainants who pointed out an emotionally disturbed male acting erratically at the location,” the New York City Police Department said in a statement. “Once officers observed the male harassing multiple complainants, they took him to custody without further incidents; no injuries were reported.”
Swift was not home at the time of the incident, after she traveled to Buffalo to see her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, play against the Bills on Sunday.
Crowe was detained by the NYPD just two days before after he was reported allegedly trying to enter the singer’s TriBeCa home on Saturday. Police told Page Six he was charged was for failure to answer an unrelated summons from 2015.
Crowe is now charged with two counts of harassment and two counts of stalking.
