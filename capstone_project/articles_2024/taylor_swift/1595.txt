The Occupy Democrats Twitter/X account doesn't exactly cover itself in glory. Sometimes, they're downright ghoulish.
So to see them get dragged and Community Noted is really a thing of beauty.
Taylor Swift’s boyfriend Jason Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs just won’t the NFL Super Bowl. Cry me a river, Trumpers! pic.twitter.com/2Jz7T8inCL
Looks like someone had too much fun at that Super Bowl party yesterday.
Either that, or they're trying to be funny and FAILED MISERABLY. We'll let you decide.
The Community Note reads:
Brutal.
Welp. The OD weekend intern is drunk pic.twitter.com/ritPSVqToo
Sure comes off that way.
"Won't"? "Jason"?Drunk tweeting isn't your forte.Sober tweeting really isn't either.Maybe just consider quitting altogether?
We wish they'd listen to that last bit of advice.

We chuckled. Hard.
Enjoy your community note! 🤗 pic.twitter.com/D7flpeEQhH
They got the note they deserved.
Is this some obscenely deep parody or are you really so stupid you don't know which NFL player plays for KC and dates Ms. Swift?
We've gotta go with the latter here.
What do you mean I’ve been replaced by my brother by both the Chiefs and Taylor? https://t.co/F4oMjboO54 pic.twitter.com/aE5T98NQvv
Excellent use of the meme template. (Find more fun ones here!)
😂😂😂😂😂These people don’t even know which Kelce is which. https://t.co/aW90q8i9DK pic.twitter.com/LRDiz7ca9Q
But they insist they're our intellectual and moral superiors.
They just won't? And wrong Kelce 😂Lay off the sauce https://t.co/ZlKU5AdvHT
Solid advice.
Democrats are just like us. No way they are removed, living in rich enclaves eating avocado toast and drinking single bean lattes https://t.co/g8vzI6WUgt
Just like us. Totally relatable.
This writer knows next to nothing about football and Taylor Swift, and even she knew they were wrong.
Lol, when the “cry me a river” statement is all you care about. https://t.co/tHd5tkEg2T
They just had to get a dig in, no matter how much they humiliated themselves to do it.
Occupy Democrats can't spell and is clueless about football. https://t.co/FcO3fLo4PR
In other news, water is wet.
Tell us something we didn't know.
They tried to dunk on Trump supporters and couldn’t even get Travis’s name right. Bunch of morons. 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/ap8lMgcvzB
They really messed up on all levels, didn't they?
Bwahahaha this is the most hilarious tweet of this morning duhhhhh lol 😂 https://t.co/BuT5fRTVTU
Someone should probably send the Occupy Democrats intern some Gatorade for that hangover. 
If you see this picture and it makes you think about politics in any way, you need to see a shrink https://t.co/d02Y931oDF
It's all the Left does: see things through a political lens. Even if it's not meant to be political. It is, frankly, exhausting.
Go drunk you’re home! https://t.co/4Bun3AMrrv
Legit laughed out loud at this one.
Community notes getting Kelce’s number wrong is just the chefs kiss https://t.co/JHCiKyxy61
It really is. What a circus. The Community Note will get a Community Note, and then we'll reach the singularity.
