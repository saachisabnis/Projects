Here in New England, we are right in the middle of cold and flu season.  Most of us know at least a few people who are sick right now.  This is especially true if you are in a family with small children.  They seem to be walking petri dishes, don't they?
When your family members get sick, you just want them to feel better.  So, you give that person some cold medicine and send them back to bed.  Of course, that cough medicine will help them sleep.
However, because of possible microbial contamination, one popular cough syrup may actually make your loved ones sicker.
According to the Food & Drug Administration, there is a massive recall of Robitussin Honey CF Max Day Adult and Robitussin Honey CF Max Nighttime Adult.
Haleon, the manufacturer of the cough syrup, issued the voluntary recall over concerns that there may be contamination in eight lots of the cough suppressant.
The FDA website says:
In immunocompromised individuals, the use of the affected product could potentially result in severe or life-threatening adverse events such as fungemia or disseminated fungal infection. In non-immunocompromised consumers, the population most likely to use the product, life-threatening infections are not likely to occur. However, the occurrence of an infection that may necessitate medical intervention cannot be completely ruled out.
So far, there have been no reports of people suffering adverse effects from ingesting the cough syrup from those lots.  The recall has been issued out of an abundance of caution.
The affected lots have expiration dates that range from May 31st of 2025 through June 30th of 2026.
