Usher has even more to celebrate than a successful Super Bowl halftime show and an impending marriage as the R&B star has now secured his first-ever diamond single.
The RIAA certified “Yeah!” 13-times platinum on Friday (February 9), pushing it past the 10 million milestone that grants it diamond status.

Usher has hit the rare milestone once before — his Confessionsalbum got there back in 2008 and is now up to 14 million in sales. However, “Yeah!” is the singer’s first single to hit the mark.
Next up in the diamond mine for Ursh might be his 2010 hit “DJ Got Us Falling In Love,” which crept closer to the mark last week by being certified eight times platinum. Check the stats for “Yeah!” below.
“Yeah!” features Lil Jon and Ludacris, both of whom joined Usher to perform it at halftime of Super Bowl LVIII.
The song was featured as part of a medley comprising some of Usher’s biggest hits, including “My Boo,” “Caught Up,” “Burn” and “OMG” among many others from across his 30-year career. The performance crammed in 13 tracks in total.

With the likes of JAY-Z, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift in attendance, the show featured a lot of complex dance choreography and, at one point, a roller-skating sequence. Additionally, the 45-year-old also paid tribute to Atlanta’s strip club culture as Ludacris performed his verse from “Yeah!” surrounded by pole dancers.
The set concluded with Usher saying, “I took the world to the A,” after which he told the crowd in Las Vegas that he loved them.
The Super Bowl itself finished with the Kansas City Chiefs beating the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 25-22 and quarterback Patrick Mahomes being named MVP.

The halftime show marked Usher’s return to Vegas after a widely successful residency in the gambling capital over the past few years.
It also capped off a busy week for the singer, who released his ninth album Coming Home prior to the explosive concert.
His first album in eight years, the 20-track project features the previously-released singles “Good Good” with 21 Savage and Summer Walker, “Ruin” with Pheelz, “Risk It All” with H.E.R. and the “Usher Remix” of Jung Kook’s “Standing Next to You.”
