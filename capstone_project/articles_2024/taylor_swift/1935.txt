Sony Music Publishing (SMP) won the quarter and the year on Billboard’s last Top Radio Airplay and Hot 100 Songs publishers rankings of 2023, while Warner Chappell held on to second place on the Hot 100 and took the No. 2 spot on Top Radio Airplay as well.

Taylor Swift and Doja Cat swapped the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in the song rankings, with Doja’s “Paint the Town Red” winning Top Radio Airplay and Swift’s “Cruel Summer” taking the top spot on Hot 100 Songs.

	The holidays added extra jingle to the late Johnny Marks’ royalty statement. He ranked as the top songwriter with four of his holiday classics on Hot 100 Songs, including Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,” which ranked No. 6.
