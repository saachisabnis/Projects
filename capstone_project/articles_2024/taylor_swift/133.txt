Awards season is here and it’s the question in every Swiftie’s mind: Is Taylor Swift going to the 2024 Golden Globes with Travis Kelce? 
Their relationship captured headlines for months and it all started with The Eras Tour. During an episode of the podcast “New Heights” in July 2023, Travis revealed that he tried to give Taylor a friendship bracelet with the digits of his phone number before her concert for her Eras Tour at the Arrowhead Stadium, in Kansas City, Kansas. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings, so I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said on the podcast.

Taylor revealed for the first time in her Time 2023 Person of The Year profile how they met. “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,”  Taylor revealed, referring to when Travis revealed on his New Heights podcast over the summer that he tried to give singer his number via a friendship bracelet at her Eras Tour show in Kansas City. “We started hanging out right after that,” she added. “So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. ”
Unlike previous relationships, she’s proud of going public with her boyfriend. “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she explained. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”
Taylor Swift will be attending the 2024 Golden Globes. She wore a stunning and sleek green dress on the red carpet. The Eras Tour movie was nominated for the new category Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. It has grossed more than $250 million globally, including $178.2 million domestically and $71.8 million internationally. 
 The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing concert film in domestic box office history for an opening weekend, overtaking 2011’s Justin Bieber: Never Say Never which earned $73 million. It’s still contending with the genre’s global record holder, 2009’s Michael Jackson: This Is It which earned $261 million.
Swift made an exclusive deal with AMC to distribute the film where she receives about 57% of ticket sales, with exhibitors keeping the remaining revenues and AMC taking a small distribution fee. Ticket prices for the film were $19.89 in honor of her album 1989 while children and senior prices were picked $13.13 for her lucky number. 
Is Taylor Swift going to the Golden Globes with Travis Kelce? It doesn’t seem like Travis Kelce will be attending the Golden Globes this year, though the two will both be in Los Angeles at the same time. 
Page Six reported that Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs will be playing against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on January 7, 2023, on the same day as the Golden Globes. Though he would be in the same area as his girlfriend, sources told the site there was no chance that he would attend the awards ceremony. He will reportedly be busy gearing up for the NFL playoffs season and not on the red carpet. Right after the game, he will fly back to Kansas City with his team.
Taylor Swift has been nominated four times for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and has attended on multiple occasions. Most recently, her track “Carolina,” a folk song written for Where the Crawdads Sing was nominated in 2023. She was first nominated in 2013 for “Safe & Sound” from The Hunger Games, before her subsequent nominations for “Sweeter Than Fiction” from One Chance in 2014, “Beautiful Ghosts” from Cats in 2020.
