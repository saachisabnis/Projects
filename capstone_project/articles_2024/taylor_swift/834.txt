Happy Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen. It felt weird to go a full day without any NFL Playoff action after an exciting weekend, but we’ll have to make things work over the next few days. Luckily, the NBA provided plenty of excitement on Monday night with Joel Embiid’s 70-point performance, and Karl Anthony-Towns’ 62-point performance — even if the Timberwolves did blow the game against the Hornets. It all happened on the 18th anniversary of Kobe Bryant’s career-high 81-point performance. Let’s hope the scoring is infectious and can roll into tonight’s, including an NBA on TNT doubleheader. On the tennis front, American star Coco Gauff punched her ticket to the Australian Open semifinal. While we wait for tonight’s slate of games, let’s check out some of the headlines from around the web that we may have missed.

This may be one of the best takes on a Filet-O-Fish I’ve ever seen.
