Also, Senate passes bill to ban ‘bots’ on ticket purchases

DES MOINES — Iowa House Republicans have introduced two bills designed to spur economic development in rural Iowa.
House Study Bill 715 directs $300,000 from a state fund used to support skilled worker training and job creation efforts in the state to the Iowa Economic Development Authority for the cost of certifying project-ready industrial sites in rural Iowa. The money would be spent on what Iowa House Republicans have coined "Freedom Sites" in counties with a population of less than 50,000. The money would be used on two certified sites per congressional district each year, up to $30,000 each.
"This bill will help unlock the potential of rural Iowa," House Ways and Means chairman Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, said in a statement. "House Republicans want to make sure that we're making economic development a priority everywhere in this state, not just near the big cities. This investment in our certified sites program builds on last year's MEGA sites legislation to ensure we are boosting up and building brighter futures for rural Iowa."
House Study Bill 722 creates a new rural development tax credit designed to encourage investment in new or expanding businesses in Iowa's 88 smallest counties. It allows up to $27 million in tax credits for investors in projects expected to generate $45 million in economic activity.
"By incentivizing investors to put their money into projects in rural Iowa, we can create more jobs, lift up local economies, and build back vibrant communities,“ said bill manager Rep. Derek Wulf, R-Hudson.
Legislation designed to restrict ticket buyers from using online services and programs to purchase large amounts of event tickets — often with the goal of reselling for a profit — passed unanimously out of the Iowa Senate.
Senate File 2322 would prevent anyone from using a computer program — or “bot” — and multiple other online tools and tricks to buy more than eight tickets at a time.
During brief debate in the Senate, lawmakers made multiple popular music references. Sen. Liz Bennett, D-Cedar Rapids, said messing with Iowa ticket buyers creates “bad blood” and urged swift approval, both in reference to pop superstar Taylor Swift and one of her famous songs. Sen. Jeff Reichman, R-Montrose, recalled that when he was young, “All I wanted was my MTV.”
The bill now is eligible for consideration in the Iowa House.
Iowans would be able to request the ability to choose their own blood donor for transfusions and other medical procedures under legislation approved along party lines in the Iowa Senate.
Democrats opposed the bill, Senate File 2369, and suggested it was brought because some people who are against vaccinations want to be able to avoid receiving blood from people who have been vaccinated.
“This bill is a bill based in ignorance. It’s here because people believe that vaccinations in an individual’s blood ... will be carried over to them and somehow affect their health,” Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said during floor debate. “It’s ridiculous.”
Sen. Jeff Edler, R-State Center, said the bill was not designed to deal with vaccines, but simply to give Iowans the choice to have a known blood donor.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for patients to receive a known donor blood donation,” Edler said. “This is allowing Iowans the right to choose what they want for a transfusion.”
Only Republicans voted for and only Democrats voted against the bill, which now is eligible for consideration in the Iowa House.
Legislation requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for diagnostic and supplemental breast examinations the same as mammogram screening unanimously passed the Iowa House.
“This is something that is going to help a lot of Iowans,” said Rep. Tracy Ehlert, D-Cedar Rapids. “And it’s something that could have helped me.”
Ehlert was diagnosed with breast cancer last year.
“I was one of those individuals that require the advanced testing, which isn’t always covered by insurance and sometimes isn’t recommended due to the cost,” she said. “When I was diagnosed with breast cancer last session, it was an MRI that actually caught it. It wasn’t my mammogram and ultrasound that I get on a regular basis, and had even gotten just a couple months prior to that MRI.”
Women in the United States have a one in eight chance to develop breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.
“There are so many people who have breast cancer scares that need workups that are not currently covered by insurance,” said Rep. Megan Srinivas, a physician and Democrat from Des Moines. “And because of that they delay their care, delay being diagnosed and end up often with far more advanced rates of cancer than would have been if we’d been able to get them the care they need when they needed it.”
The bill now is eligible for consideration in the Iowa Senate.
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources would be directed to create recommendations to improve the accessibility of Iowa’s state parks and public recreation areas under a bill House lawmakers passed unanimously Wednesday.
The bill, House File 2364, would direct the department to research accessibility for people with disabilities at state parks. It would also need to provide information online and in brochures about the opportunities for people with disabilities in state parks.
Rep. Adam Zabner, a Democrat from Iowa City who proposed the bill, said it would improve access to the outdoors for Iowans with disabilities.
“I think every Iowan deserves that basic access to the outdoors, and this bill is going to help Iowans with disabilities be able to reach the outdoors and have those experiences in our great parks and natural lands,” Zabner said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Wednesday she has appointed Cedar Rapids attorney and Judicial Magistrate Mark Fisher to serve as a district judge.
Fisher, who is a partner at Howes Law Firm P.C., fills a vacancy created after the retirement of 6th Judicial District Judge Sean McPartland. The 6th Judicial District includes Benton, Iowa, Johnson, Jones, Linn and Tama counties.
Fisher received his undergraduate degree from Arizona State University and his law degree from the University of Iowa, according to the governor’s office.
