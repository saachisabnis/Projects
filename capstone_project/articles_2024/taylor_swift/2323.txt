Ice Spice is revealing the sound musical advice she received from Taylor Swift.
On Monday (March 4), Billboard shared their latest interview with Ice Spice. During the interview, the Bronx, N.Y rapper revealed the music advice she got from Swift while they worked on their collab "Karma (Remix)" in 2023.
"When I was in the studio with Taylor, like, I’ll never forget," Ice said. "She told me, 'No matter what, just keep making music and everything’s going to be fine.'"
Ice Spice and Taylor Swift have formed a strong bond following their musical collab. Ice recently showed up to the 2024 Super Bowl with Taylor and enjoyed the game from the pop star's suite.
