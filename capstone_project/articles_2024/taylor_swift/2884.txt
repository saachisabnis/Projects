One of the world's most-famous cartoon characters can now be found in Loveland, Colorado. What makes the mural so special is that the community helped to create it.
When you stroll through Downtown Loveland, you can actually check out two murals that were done during the Sweetheart Festival of 2024: One of Mickey & Minnie, and one of Bigfoot.
Loveland, Colorado, has long been known as an "art" town, with all the sculptures you'll find; but the town does have other art, such as these murals in Downtown. Created by a local fine artist, Scott Freeman, he creates the design, then the community helps to pain the tiles.
From 2022:
Between the two murals for 2024, 400 festival-goers painted the tiles. Mickey and Minnie, along Lincoln Avenue near 3rd Street, is made up of 168 tiles.
An up-close look at one of the 168 tiles:
From the artist:
The Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain on Jan 1st of 2024. So we took the opportunity to use the 1928 version of Mickey & Minnie for one of our community murals.
The other mural done in 2024 is of Bigfoot, which took 240 tiles; you'll find it along 4th Street, on the east outside wall of Burk's Tavern.
What a great quote, too:
Love is out there, don't give up the search - Bigfoot.
