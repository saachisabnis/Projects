That’s one way to tease an album rollout.
Katy Perry showed off a wild new look at the Billboard Women in Music Awards 2024 in Inglewood, Calif. Wednesday night, wearing a red lace-up corset and matching skirt along with a bold butterfly design on her lower back, which is likely an Easter Egg for her forthcoming music.
The “Teenage Dream” singer, 39, shared a peek at what one fan called a “3D futuristic tramp stamp” on Instagram Thursday morning, captioning the photos, “you’re my butterfly, sugar, baby.”
Along with referencing the Crazy Town song, the raised flesh-colored butterfly on her lower back is likely part of her new music as the singer has been showing off the pollinator in multiple ways on social media. 
The 3D design — which is a prosthetic by Emmy-winning artist Hugo Villasenor — sat just below her strapless pepum-style corset by Ellie Misner, with the “I Kissed a Girl” singer sticking out her behind toward the camera in the first photo to display the design. 
Perry wore a black thong pulled up above her long scarlet skirt — which showed off a peek at her bare booty — coordinating her long black nails to her undies. 
Perry — who recently quit “American Idol” after seven seasons — wore her dark hair in a long ponytail, accessorizing with a pearl necklace and matching earrings.
The “Roar” singer finished off her look with sky-high Vivienne Westwood platform heels from Los Angeles-based Pechuga Vintage.
Some fans were loving her racy red carpet look, with one writing, “jaw-dropping, eye-poppingHead-turning, body-shocking 😍😍🔥🦋🦋🦋🦋.”

Others wondered if the pop star would reignite a lower-back tattoo trend, like one Instagram user who wrote, “Guess my butterfly tramp stamp is officially cool again. Thanks Katy Perry.” 
The “Dark Horse” singer was a surprise guest at the awards show, presenting Executive of the Year to her dear friend Michelle Jubelirer, who recently stepped down as chairman-CEO of Capitol Music Group.
Perry’s appearance at the Billboard event follows her recent trip to Sydney to see Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert, with the “Last Friday Night” singer dancing along to “Bad Blood,” a song allegedly written about her. 
She even flashed Swift’s signature move at the start of her Billboards speech, holding her hands up in a heart over her head.
As for Perry’s new butterfly, watch this space to see if it flies away for her next appearance.
