We're all 99 percent sure thatÂ The Alchemy -- the new Taylor Swift song from The Tortured Poets Department -- is about Travis Kelce, with all kinds of winks and references to the Kansas City Chiefs tight end who also happens to be her boyfriend.
But what if there's a shoutout in the lyrics to another Kelce? Specifically: what if it's about Jason Kelce?
"Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads," she sings. Now, that could be a painting of a typical athlete who wins something and gets carried. But the "shirts off" reference -- along with "beer stickin' to the floor" -- has fans convinced it's about Jason Kelce, who went shirtless to cheer on Travis in Buffalo earlier this year while consuming beer. Hmm!
