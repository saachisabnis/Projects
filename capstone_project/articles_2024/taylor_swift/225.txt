Within the first eight weeks of 2024, 13 motion picture guilds announced their nominations for the best work in their fields during the previous year. Those who made their voices heard prior to the January 23 Oscar nominations announcement were the makeup artists & hairstylists, costume designers, art directors, sound mixers, actors, directors, cinematographers, producers, casting directors, visual effects artists, and sound editors. The film editors revealed their picks on Jan. 25, while the writers (citing their recent five-month strike) delayed their proclamation until Feb. 21.
After weeks of consistently outpacing its challengers in terms of guild recognition, “Oppenheimer” (our Best Picture Oscar frontrunner) finished as the only film with nominations from all 13 groups. In a close second is “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which lost its chance at a perfect run by missing out on a makeup and hairstyling bid at the start of the season.
Below is a full breakdown of guild nominations by film.
