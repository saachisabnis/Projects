Everything that Rocks the River City
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Southwestern Indiana raises important funds every year with the super fun Bowl for Kids Sake fundraiser. This year's event Co-Chair Aurian Garrett promises a memorable experience, complete with VIP treatment, including a red carpet, paparazzi, and a pulsating rock n roll soundtrack throughout the 2-hour bowling session.
Due to the severe weather predicted for Wednesday, the Posey County event will be held on Thursday, May 9. 
Event Highlights:
Your bowling team has a goal to raise a minimum of $500 for your entire team. The Big Brothers Big Sisters staff and volunteers will help you and your team with ideas, tips, and a custom team website to help you raise your $500, and 100% of every dollar brought in goes directly to support children in our community!
