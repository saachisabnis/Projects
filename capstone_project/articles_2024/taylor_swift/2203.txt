KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Pop-Tarts has a challenge for Taylor Swift - drop her homemade Pop-Tarts recipe and the company will double its donation to a Kansas City food bank.
Pop-Tarts, one of the nation’s favorite breakfast treats, has called on Taylor Swift, Kansas City’s most famous fan, to release her Timeless recipe for Pop-Tarts (Taylor’s Version) after she baked the homemade treats for the Chiefs’ offensive line.
Chiefs’ head coach Andy Reid told NBC Sports he had a Sweet Nothing as the treats had vanished before he had the chance to get his hands on one. Pop-Tarts has now put out a full-page ad to ask the international mega-star to share her recipe.
If Swift releases her recipe, the company said it would double its donation to Harvesters, a Feeding America Food Bank in Kansas City - and give Coach Reid a taste with no Bad Blood.
This would not be the first time that the Tortured Poet, who is known to enjoy baking, has released one of her recipes. Her most famous recipe, for Chai Cookies, was released in 2021.
Pop-Tarts noted that “homemade Pop-Tart recipe” was one of the top trending searches after Coach Reid dropped the news.
