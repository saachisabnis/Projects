Some listeners are convinced the pop star sings background vocals on the track "Bodyguard."

	In the lead-up to Beyoncé‘s new album Cowboy Carter, rumors swirled that a certain country-turned-pop star may be a featured collaborator on the project. When it finally dropped at midnight Friday (March 29), however, Taylor Swift‘s name was nowhere in sight on the credits.

	But wait. Who’s that singing in the background on track eight? 

	After listening, many fans were immediately convinced that Swift actually did have a cameo, albeit a small one, on Bey’s Renaissance sequel, potentially providing a few complementary vocals for the song “Bodyguard.” (The person behind those repeating “Ahh” counter melodies does sound remarkably like the “Anti-Hero” artist.)

	










	“THAT IS 100% TAYLOR SWIFT ON BODYGUARD BY BEYONCÉ NOW GIVE ME A FULL COLLAB,” one Swiftie tweeted shortly after Cowboy Carter dropped.

	“wait i can really hear taylor singing the ahhs in bodyguard…,” wrote another person, while a third fan added, “IS TAYLOR DOING THE BACKGROUND VOCALS FOR BODYGUARD OR NOT SOMEONE TELL ME.”

	But no, Swift’s voice is not included in “Bodyguard.”

	That may be a disappointing fact for fans of the two women, who have been in each other’s corners since Bey supported Swift at the 2009 VMAs after Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) interrupted the “Karma” musician during her best female video acceptance speech. Last year, the Ivy Park founder attended the premiere of Swift’s Eras Tour concert film premiere, soon after which the Pennsylvania-born pop star showed up to the Houston native’s Renaissance movie debut in London.

	“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce‘s influence,” Swift wrote of Bey on Instagram after the Eras event. “The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms. Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale. 😇🙏🥹”
