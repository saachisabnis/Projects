In this clip, Tony Yayo disputed Dr. Umar Johnson's claim that Eminem shouldn't be considered one of the greatest rappers because he isn't Black. Contrary to this view, Yayo praised Eminem, admitting he is among his top five personal favorite emcees, a view sparked by becoming an Eminem fan after his "Renegade" performance with Jay-Z. Yayo also cites Eminem's immense influence on hip-hop, including nurturing well-respected groups like D12 and Slaughterhouse as well as modern artists like Griselda. Yayo stressed that when considering who the top emcees are, it's not about individual emotional preference but the ability to sell out arenas and move millions of albums. He compared Eminem's potential concert pull to Taylor Swift's, estimating he could easily attract 100,000 people to a show, equating him to other musical juggernauts like Drake, 50 Cent, and Snoop Dogg.
