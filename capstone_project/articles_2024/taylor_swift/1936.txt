BEYONCE: (Singing) This ain't Texas - woo. Ain't no Hold 'em - hey.
MARTIN: Beyonce's "Texas Hold 'em" has topped the Hot Country Songs chart, making her the first Black woman with a No. 1 country song. She also joins - guess who? - Taylor Swift as the only two women who, as solo acts, have debuted on the country chart at No. 1.
