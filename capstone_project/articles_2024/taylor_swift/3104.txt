Despite being a reigning back-to-back Super Bowl champ and the boyfriend of Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce might not even be the most in-demand Kelce brother right now.
Andrew Marchand of The Athletic reported Wednesday that recently retired former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce is being aggressively pursued by ESPN. The Worldwide Leader is reportedly eyeing Jason for “Monday Night Football” (with Robert Griffin III’s spot on the broadcast now said to be in jeopardy).
But Marchand adds that ESPN isn't alone in its pursuit of Jason — he is also generating interest from NBC, CBS and Amazon Prime Video. Thus, Jason’s decision is reportedly viewed as the linchpin of the NFL TV free-agent season.
The 36-year-old Jason just announced his retirement from the NFL after 13 seasons, seven Pro Bowl selections, six All-Pro nods and a Super Bowl title with the Eagles in the 2017-18 campaign. He has a pretty magnetic personality (as we saw multiple times in just the last few months alone), and it sounds like a real bidding war is about to ensue for his services.
Should ESPN miss out on Jason, who is based in Philadelphia, it has some other massive names on its reported wish list. But it appears that ESPN will do whatever it can to reel in America’s favorite lumberjack.
