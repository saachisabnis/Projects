The Hot 100 is widely considered the definitive all-genre singles chart in the US.
Although it was officially launched in 1958, Billboard began using modern airplay and sales data in 1991, allowing for more time-sensitive calculations and accurate rankings.
"Fantasy," the lead single from Carey's fifth studio album "Daydream," was the first song in the modern era to become an immediate and long-lasting hit. It debuted at No. 1 on the chart dated September 30, 1995.

While the country song was initially boosted by conservative pundits — who praised its anti-greed and pro-worker message —  it topped the chart for a second week after Oliver Anthony criticized its political use.
"It was funny seeing my song at the [Republican] presidential debate because I wrote that song about those people," Anthony said in a YouTube video.
"Like That" debuted at No. 1 on the chart dated April 6, 2024, after it was included on Future and Metro Boomin's collaborative album "We Don't Trust You."
The song sparked chatter of a rap feud thanks to Kendrick Lamar's guest verse, in which he disses J. Cole and Drake ("Motherfuck the big three, it's just big me").
Once "Like That" topped the chart, Cole responded with his own diss track about Lamar, "7 Minute Drill," which continued to fuel interest in their dispute. However, Cole apologized shortly after. Drake also responded, didn't back down, and his feud with Lamar quickly went nuclear.
Meanwhile, "Like That" held firm at No. 1 for three consecutive weeks.

It topped the chart for a second consecutive week, giving Swift her third entry on this list — the second-most behind Carey.
"I Had Some Help" debuted at No. 1 on the chart dated May 25, 2024.
The country duet topped the chart for a second consecutive week, followed by hits like Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" at No. 2 and Billie Eilish's sapphic bop "Lunch" at No. 5.
In total, the song notched six nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1.
