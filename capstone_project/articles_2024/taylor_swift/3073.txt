After a “much-needed” vacation in the Bahamas (at the same place she’d visited with ex Joe Alwyn a couple of years ago), Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were spotted enjoying lunch at Nobu in Malibu on a date.
“They vacationed in the Bahamas for several days,” a source told People. “It was a much-needed break for both of them. They very much enjoyed it. They are so happy together.” A few days before their lunch date, the champion tight end visited his hometown of Cleveland, stopping by one of his favorite restaurants for a slice of pizza.

Taylor won’t resume her Eras Tour until May when she’ll play four shows in Paris before continuing to her other European dates. Travis’ football obligations begin as preseason practice in April, so the couple still have some time off to enjoy together. “They are spending time in Los Angeles together. They’re still very happy,” another source told People. “Travis has been hanging out with friends and is having a good time just relaxing in L.A.,” another insider shared. 
Eagle-eyed fans spotted the couple in The Bahamas and shared a sliiightly invasive snap to celeb gossip bible DeuxMoi, published on Monday, March 18, 2024. “They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,” a source told Us Weekly.
Her vacay with Travis came after Taylor announced her new album Tortured Poets Department was going to be released on April 19, 2024, after winning the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album. “My brand-new album comes out April 19. It’s called The Tortured Poets Department, I’m gonna go and post the cover right now backstage,” she said in her acceptance speech.
Rumor has it some of the songs on the album will be about her ex, Joe. “I needed to make it. It was really a lifeline for me,” Swift told fans at a February Eras concert. “It sort of reminded me of why songwriting is something that actually gets me through life and I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets.”
