Big events can certainly be a lot of fun, but unfortunately, there are also plenty of issues that usually go hand in hand with them, with the most relevant one being the bathroom situation. 
When the break in the program finally hits, and everybody rushes to relieve themselves, the lack of space is inevitable. As men take care of their business and free up space quicker, it’s understandable that some women choose to go there instead of waiting in a queue. However, as one Redditor shared, the issue arises when, despite being visitors, some ladies start applying their own rules and shame men for using urinals with them around. Scroll down to find out what exactly went down!

The OP accompanied his girlfriend to a big concert, which women mostly attended. When, after a while, he decided to go to the bathroom, the waiting lines were huge. Since, as usual, the queue to the women’s restroom was significantly bigger, some ladies opted to go to the men’s bathroom instead.
The guy waited in line, got in, took care of his business at the urinal, and got out without taking up space. But when he did and met back up with his girlfriend, another woman came over and started verbally bashing him, calling him a pervert and sex pest for exposing himself to women, adding that he should’ve waited for a stall to open up.
When the woman walked away, the guy explained to his girlfriend that he did it pretty discreetly and didn’t actually expose himself to anyone. Yet, she didn’t seem happy about it, replying that while she wouldn’t break up with him over something like this, she viewed it as inconsiderate and unthoughtful, as he wasn’t bursting and could’ve waited.
The commenters, both men and women, unanimously sided with the OP. Not only did they agree that there was nothing wrong with using a urinal in a men’s bathroom with women around, as it was, after all, a men’s bathroom, but they also said that the man’s girlfriend’s position seemed like a red flag and he should reconsider whether it’s worth keeping going.

But if we look around, the situation in our story was rather tame compared to some other recent happenings concerning bathrooms at big events. For example, some of the most recent incidents that occurred at Taylor Swift’s concert in Atlanta left a couple of female fans ejected from the concert for using the men’s bathroom, according to Channel Nine.
The two women were outraged, as they not only had spent 15 hours in the queue for the tickets that cost hundreds of dollars, but also had to drive for hours to the concert venue, all to get kicked out and banned from attending the said venue again, despite plenty of other women also using the men’s bathroom as the line to the women’s toilets was extremely long.
While they also met one other girl with Crohn’s disease who was ejected despite having a medical pass saying she could not wait, there were plenty of contrasting accounts from other women, stating that some attendants were actually ushering them into the men’s bathroom, telling them where to wait and which stall to go into.

Another spectacle came from Taylor Swift’s other concert, this time in Texas. Chuck Arnold from the New York Post wrote about a viral video where a confused man actually went out of the men’s bathroom to make sure that he was really where he was supposed to be as it was completely filled with women.
Some people commenting under it shared similar experiences where, in the men’s bathrooms filled with women, men were shamed for just coming inside, let alone relieving themselves in a urinal. There were also some unnecessarily malicious commenters, too, talking about how they try to prevent women from using men’s restrooms by intentionally aiming everywhere but the bowl.
So, in the end, it’s quite obvious that in these situations, both men and women can be quite toxic. While there is undeniably a bigger problem that should be addressed by the people planning the event venues and the concerts in them, these changes won’t happen overnight. So, for the moment, let’s try to understand each other’s position by not being mad at ladies for using men’s bathrooms and not shaming men for using them at the same time.

 Hey! I’m Dominykas, and I come from Lithuania. According to my diploma, I’m a UX Designer. However, when during my studies, I (re)discovered my passion for storytelling, I’ve been doing that ever since, mostly in writing. I have written a few short stories, some songs, and a good bunch of articles, and I plan to keep expanding on all these fronts. Aside from that, I’m also a film buff, traveler, casual basketball player, video game enthusiast, and nature lover who will rarely pass up on a little hike through the forest or a simple walk around a park.

One of the reasons why there's not a big line for men's urinals is the use of these aforementioned urinals. If the women want men to also use the cubicle, there's going to be no difference between the men's and women's restrooms, right?
BTAIM, the two women complaining are idjits. Hello, they're 'trespassing', so they can't complain.
At one tourist spot I visited, there was one bathroom, unisex, cubicles only. The only complaints were from two men who hated waiting in line - which amused the women.
You can't go to the zoo and then be upset when you see animals lady...
This is the dumbest freaking thing for anyone to get upset about. No one saw the guy's body because he didn't turn around and expose anything, just like no one else was doing I assume. I guess he doesn't have the same right to pee like everyone else just because "other people" were in there.
The girlfriend is a fool.
