Tour Details
With 60 shows performed so far in 24 cities (each of which gained a measurable boost in economic activity credited to the artist’s presence), Taylor Swift’s 2023/2024 Eras trek has already emerged as the highest-grossing concert tour in history, topping the $1 billion mark in total revenues within its first year, according to Pollstar.
The first tour since Swift’s Reputation trek in 2018, the three-hour Eras extravaganza visited stadiums across the U.S., starting with a two-show stop that began March 17 in Glendale, AZ and continuing on to a six-show run at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium that ended Aug. 9. The tour then concluded its 2023 itinerary with a series of concerts in Mexico and Brazil.
Starting in February 2024, the Eras tour heads overseas, with shows in Japan, Australia and Singapore followed by a run through Europe and the UK. The 2024 itinerary is set to conclude with multiple shows planned for five North American stadiums in late 2024.
In addition to surpassing the revenue set by Elton John’s $939 million 2018-2023 Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour in its first year, Taylor Swift’s Eras tour was captured for a concert film during its visit to SoFi Stadium in the Los Angeles area in August. Titled simply Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, it has already garnered more than $250 million worldwide since its mid-October premiere, making it — you guessed it — the highest-grossing concert film of all time.
