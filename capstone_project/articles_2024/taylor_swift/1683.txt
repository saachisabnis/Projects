The Tri-State's Best Talk
Attention Indiana Swifties! Do you have what it takes to successfully break out of this Taylor Swift-themed escape room?
Taylor Swift is as popular now as she has ever been. As you know, she has a MASSIVE following of fans called "Swifties" who will do whatever it takes to see her live and support her. My bonus daughter is one of those Swifties. She's obsessed with everything Taylor Swift does. She's got the music downloaded, the apparel, and has even become a football fan recently, as Swift is currently dating Super Bowl Champion, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. Now, she and all of the other Indiana Swifties have the opportunity to partake in a really fun and unique Taylor Swift escape room.
Escape Evansville is known for a variety of unique escape rooms, as well as a rage room. However, they just announced a new experience that will surely have Swifties lining up at the door. We're talking about a brand new Taylor Swift-themed escape room called "Taylor's Closet". According to Escape Evansville, here's what you can expect from this room:
I have a feeling this will be a very big hit for Escape Evansville. The opening date for Taylor's Closet will be Wednesday, February 21st, 2024. Escape Evansville is located at 600 N Weinbach Ave Suite 940 in Evansville, Indiana. You can learn more by clicking here and get a sneak peek of the new room in the photos below.
