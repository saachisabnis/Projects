This day will live in infamy.  A small regional office of BLM in Bloomington, IN was firebombed last night.  Such brazen acts of POLITICAL VIOLENCE should never be tolerated in a free society like America.  This will rightfully lead every news show for months.  There will be daily riots in cities across the country, at least until November 5th.  Anyone who doubts how dangerous Republicans have become can just SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP now.  Next week there will be Super Bowl ads from multiple corporations denouncing right wing nationalism, racism, and hate.  Democrats will use this BRAZEN ACT OF TERRORISM to be sure that no Republican wins office this year, in any state.  Some things simply cannot be tolerated.
Oh, wait a second.  I misread the headline.  The firebombing wasn’t at a Black Lives Matter office in Bloomington.  It was the offices of three conservative organizations in Minneapolis.  Ah.  Um, ok, never mind.  You can just act like nothing happened.  Because as you’re about to see, nothing really did.  This is not a day that will live in infamy.  This is just another day.  You can go back to whatever you were doing before.
Anyway, speaking of the Super Bowl, I wonder who will win?  I like the Chiefs, but I really get tired of them showing Taylor Swift cheering every time her boyfriend scores a touchdown.  That really pisses me off.  I’m going to start an online petition demanding that the TV stations keep that rich white lady off the air.  That’s just wrong.  Somebody has to do something.
* sigh *
I just can’t imagine what it will take to get Americans to wake up and recognize how serious our situation has become.

They just had the head of American Experiment on local talk radio. He’s getting attention from everywhere except the liberal local media. All kinds of talk shows, and Australian media. I tried googling it, and barely anything came up. They will be in temporary offices for months. Terrible.

I haven’t seen this on CNN yet.
They’re probably doing a feature on this later today…

Or tomorrow. Or next week. Or maybe never?

Count me in. There are Pink Hats in every sport.
The Center for the American Experiment has 22 employees. I’m not sure how big the Upper Midwest law Center is, but they raise a lot of hell, too. That is likely going to be a very messy situation to move temporarily like that.
But something else has been distracting me: leftists firebombed my office last Saturday night. At around 2 am, they broke into the building that houses Center of the American Experiment and two other conservative organizations with which we often collaborate, along with many other businesses. The arsonists set two fires: one was in the first floor corridor between American Experiment’s office and the space we sublease to Take Charge, Kendall and Sheila Qualls’ organization. A second fire was set on the third floor, immediately outside or perhaps actually inside the office of the Upper Midwest Law Center, on whose board I serve.

Maybe, 40 years from now, this will be a day remembered.   Like the Stone Wall riots.   This day will be remembered as the first step in removing the dangerous cancers of “free enterprise, limited government, personal responsibility and government accountability”

Government accountability? Now there’s a purple unicorn.
When I Googled for a news article, many of the headlines were “Republicans say” their offices were firebombed, or “Conservatives say” their offices were firebombed.
They can’t even report on it without making it just something that “conservatives say” happen.

Hinderocker of powerline wrote about it on powerline. His office was one of the three.

Started to say, “Crickets”, but then I realized that was a change of subjects:  So forget I said anything. Please.
But it was a mostly peaceful bombing, right?
I met and chatted wit John Hinderaker when Center for the American Experiment made a presentation in Fargo, ND.  I think the presentation was on the topic of Minnesota adapting California’s auto emissions standards and pushing electric cars.  You guys know he used to be a podcaster here, right?  The show was the Hinderaker Ward Experience, and I miss it.

Those two guys used to have a radio show in Minneapolis every Saturday. I never missed it. It was awesome. 
I went to the Star Tribune site after reading this on Powerline this morning. I didn’t see a thing on it. Maybe they have gotten around to it by now (1:15 EST), but I doubt it. As you say, Doc, had it been a BLM office we’d be sick of hearing about it already.

Maybe arson isn’t a news story anymore in Minneapolis – a sun rises in east event. .

There is a brief account of the fire bombing on the paper’s web site. Not exactly above the fold. The word ‘conservative’ appeared numerous times.
Democrats are pro violence.

Northern Alliance Radio Network.  I saved a lot of the podcasts, still have them.

I remember when Powerline used to list blogs under the title “Northern Alliance” with Hugh Hewitt, Lileks, etc.

Yes, James was an occasional guest on NARN, sometimes for 2 “hours,” usually with Mitch Berg and/or Ed Morrisey.  Those are some of my favorites, going back to the early 2000s, and I still replay them occasionally.
James seemed to pretty much disappear from Hugh’s show with the shift to mornings, understandably.  After that he turned up more often on Duane Patterson’s “Aftershow” which came in the afternoon still, but Duane can be – as some say about various political figures – “a long day.”
I believe it started out as the Northern Alliance of Bloggers, the radio shows came a bit later.
Mitch still has a 2-hour radio show on Saturdays, and there’s a guy I haven’t heard of with another two hours on Saturday under the NARN banner, plus a third guy I haven’t heard of with two hours on Sunday.  Looks like podcasts are available, but I don’t see how far back they go.
Under state and city law, doesn’t government have to reimburse them for the costs of bomb making materials and travel expenses?
Isn’t Hinderaker a known opponent of greater Somali lebensraum?
Other than Lileks, what is left of value in Minneapolis?
Garrison Keiller and other known Lutheran supremacists are banned now, right?

How about “controversial?” 
I’m just coming back this once to comment because as an employee of American Experiment, I can hopefully provide this: we are in no way intimidated or scared by this heinous act of violence. In fact, this has only steeled our resolve in our commitment to freedom and truth seeking. I am very blessed to have colleagues who are continually threatened and sent disgusting messages and nonetheless persist.
It makes me very angry that people’s minds are so poisoned by their ideology and hate that they would resort to political violence — the very place I bring my baby daughter to work with me, where I’ve never once felt we were in danger even though I often work in the later evenings, alone. But this is the world we now live in, and one American Experiment is hoping to change for the better. Good will prevail. It must.

They are both very, very good, but I’m just not in the mood for that, at that hour on those days.
On Sunday nights at 6 PM I listen to the Victory Hour on 1570 am. It’s about Israel, Jews, politics, and the law. Really good. The guy does whatever he wants with the show and it’s always very good. Really original discussion.  It’s on The Patriot 1280am as well, but I don’t know what time that is. I think it’s on Saturday.
When I read Yer title My first thought was, “it must be a member of BLM.”

Take care Jenna and other CAE employees.  Obviously you are right over the target or you wouldn’t be taking this kind of flak.  It’s good to hear your resolve.

The Thursday Aftershow is still a standing feature, and I try to make most weeks. Say, 40 out of 52 weeks per year. And thanks for listening!

StarTribune had it up Friday at 10:45 AM. (I work there.)
Here’s my play-by-play: I found out about it Thursday afternoon via Twitter, like most people, I think. I didn’t get any DMs or emails from Center people or friends associated with the orgs. Friday morning I went over to the guy who rides the scanners and does all the local spot news, and said I had something for him about an arson at a think-tank; he gestured to his second monitor and said “already on it.” The piece was up about 20 minutes later.
Over at the Minnesota subreddit they are unanimous in their belief that the Center of the American Experiment set the fire themselves, for insurance or publicity.
