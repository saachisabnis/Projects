Q: 
The broadcaster discusses her cultural life, from her love of Anne Tyler and Taylor Swift’s album Folklore to her disdain for French films.
My favourite author Anne Tyler. I’d read anything by her. Literally her shopping list if she’d let me. She came on the podcast during the pandemic and was heavenly. Wise, thoughtful and she also told us all about her domestic schedule: she cleans on a rota basis — surfaces on a Tuesday, hoovering on a Wednesday — that kind of thing. I don’t know why, but it made me love her even more.
The book I’m reading I’ve got two on the go: Claire Keegan’s Antarctica — a series of stories, so that might not count — and Jane Harper’s Exiles.
