Two Shell have recruited FKA Twigs for a new song, Talk To Me.
The glitchy and clubby dance-pop tune arrives after the elusive British electronic duo posted different versions of the track with various vocalists on their Bandcamp.
The latest edition of Talk To Me follows the previously teased iterations with BTS' Jungkook, Frank Ocean, Taylor Swift, PinkPantheress, and Chris Martin, all of which were posted online and then removed. 
It also marks the first music from Twigs since her 2022 single Killer, which followed her 'Caprisongs' mixtape released in January of that year. She's also set to appear in the upcoming remake of The Crow, and revealed during a discussion on her Discord that she'll drop a new techno-influenced album later this year.
Two Shell will play Coachella in California in April.
