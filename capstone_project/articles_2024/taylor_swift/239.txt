T-Swizzle sure knows to sizzle.
In fact, Taylor Swift has gotten the thumbs-up from none other than burlesque queen Dita Von Teese when it comes to the sultry moves that she put on display in her “Bejeweled” video.
And she should know: Not only did Von Teese school the pop superstar on burlesque, but she performed the martini-glass routine right beside her in which they make like the sexiest of swizzle sticks. 
“The best experience was Taylor,” Von Teese, 51, said when discussing her burlesque training on a new episode of the “Allison Interviews” podcast.
“She’s really, like, a kind girl. She knew everything about what I do.”
In fact, Swift — who just went viral for her unamused glare when Golden Globes host Jo Koy made a joke about her on Sunday — wanted to have Von Teese shake it off too when cameras began to roll for the clip hit single from her 2022 blockbuster “Midnights.”
“She wanted to not just have me be behind the scenes teaching her to be, you know, in my glass,” said Von Teese. “She wanted to showcase what I do.”
And of course, the 15-time Grammy winner — who is up for six more gramophones on Feb. 4 — got her wish for the star-studded video, which also features Laura Dern, the female pop-rock trio Haim and famous makeup artist Pat McGrath.
While in their respective martini glasses, both Swift and Von Teese strip off a stocking before taking a sensuous soak in a liquid squeezed from giant olives. 
But Von Teese hasn’t always had such model students. On the podcast, she recalls when she was asked to teach Bethenny Frankel the same routine for “Bethenny,” her 2012-2014 talk show.
“Guess what? She didn’t show up for rehearsal!” she revealed.
“I was like, ‘Why am I at rehearsal? I don’t need to rehearse. I can do this blindfolded with one hand tied behind my back.’”
And Von Teese had absolutely no sympathy for Frankel when it was showtime.
“Then we did it live on camera, and I was like, ‘You’re on your own.’”
