East Texas' #1 For New Country
After hearing for weeks that the teams were "pre-determined" based on the "colors of the logo" or the old "it's rigged so the NFL can get Taylor Swift more TV time", we now know the two teams that will face off in the Super Bowl.
The San Francisco 49ers versus the Kansas City Chiefs. If you don't care for neither team, that's okay for us here in East Texas because two communities here will have rooting interest thanks to two of the games premeire stars.
San Francisco 49ers star left tackle Trent Williams who paved the way for San Francisco’s dramatic 34–31 win over the Detroit Lions in the NFC championship game, will be making his first Super Bowl trip in his career.
Williams spent the first nine seasons of his career starring in Washington, appearing in just two playoff games. In 2019, he held out the entire year due to contractual and personal grievances with Washington.
Mahomes made even more history over the weekend as he became the YOUNGEST Quarterback All-Time To Win 4 Conference Championship games. The two years they didn’t get to the Super Bowl, they lost in the AFC Championship Game, in overtime both times.
Every single year Mahomes has been the Chiefs’ starter, they’ve been in the AFC Championship Game.
It's Longview Vs. Whitehouse (at least in our eyes here in East Texas) for all the marbles Sunday Feb. 11th in Las Vegas. Who you got?
