Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were spotted making out during Coachella’s ultra-exclusive Neon Carnival afterparty in Indio, Calif., Saturday night.
According to a fan video, the A-list couple couldn’t stop sharing smooches while sitting in a secluded area at the event hosted by Patron El Alto, Liquid IV and Levi’s.
At one point, the “Lover” songstress briefly pulled away from the Kansas City Chiefs star, who whispered something at her before they locked lips yet again.
The two were completely unbothered by the people dancing around them to the music of “Vanderpump Rules” star James Kennedy, per TMZ.
One eagled-eyed fan speculated that the NFL player “said, ‘I love you baby,'” to his superstar girlfriend.
Other fans were more impressed by how careless the two were as they packed the PDA in public. 
“Oh spicy 🌶🔥,” one person wrote.

“That’s hot,” another added while a third said, “Good god. I am unwell 🥺🥺❤️.”
“End game 🥰,” another raved as a fifth added, “They were meant for each other.” 
Meanwhile, a few other fans felt guilty for invading the two’s privacy but couldn’t help but gush over Swift’s bombshell relationship with Kelce. 
“Leave them alone but give me all of it 😻😻,” one fan wrote.
“Privacy please … it’s our girl but I can’t stop watching them,” another added. 
Fans anticipated the couple, both 34, would attend the annual music festival after Us Weekly reported they wanted to support Jack Antonoff and his band, Bleachers, during their performance Saturday night.
Sure enough, Page Six spotted the lovebirds jamming backstage. 
Swift and Kelce later mingled with fans in the VIP section while watching her close pal Ice Spice perform. 
The tight end wrapped his arm around the “Cruel Summer” singer from behind as they swayed back and forth. 
“I never thought I would be able to see Taylor in Coachella or in the middle of the crowd again in my life,” one fan gushed on social media.
The 14-time Grammy winner and the NFL star haven’t shied away from flaunting their romance since they went public in September 2023. 
Swift notably attended nearly all of her beau’s football games, including the 2024 Super Bowl in February, where she kissed Kelce after he helped lead his team to victory against the San Francisco 49ers.
Following the big game, they were yet again spotted making out and dancing while at the XS Nightclub at the Wynn in Las Vegas. 
During his off-season, the “New Heights” podcaster supported the hitmaker during her Eras Tour performances in March. After the concert, he was always greeted by Swift with a passionate kiss.
As the two take time off from their respective careers, they’ve since gone on vacation to the Bahamas and enjoyed sushi dates in Los Angeles, where they are both currently staying.
