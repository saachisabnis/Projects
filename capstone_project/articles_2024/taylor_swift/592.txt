Some rejoiced. Some complained. No matter the reaction, one of the most anticipated lineups of the year is here: We now know who is scheduled to perform at 2024’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival .
The three-day, two-weekend festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio is set to return to the desert on April 12-14 and April 19-21, 2024 and will feature headliners Lana Del Rey, Tyler, The Creator and Doja Cat.
The internet was anxiously awaiting the lineup – which was announced on Jan. 10 the year prior – in the early days of the new year.

So when Goldenvoice, the producers of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival announced the 2024 lineup on Jan. 16, the internet was quick to react.

Some of the most Internet excitement came from this year’s special guest performance, No Doubt, who had hinted at a reunion performance ahead of the lineup drop.
Would only go to Coachella for NO DOUBT

And, predictably, the K-pop fan armies came out and celebrated South Korean boyband ATEEZ’ spot on the lineup. Last year, K-pop fans nearly broke the internet with their reactions to Blackpink’s historic Coachella performance.

For some, their critique of the lineup had less to do with the headliners and more to do with the days that each headliner is performing, with Lana Del Rey on Friday, Tyler, The Creator on Saturday and Doja Cat slated for Sunday.
“I find it interesting that Doja Cat is on the final day and Lana Del Rey is on the first day,” Tiktok user @louislevanti said in a video. “I feel like they would keep the, like, slower vibe, slower jam artist for the Sunday, but I guess not.”

Of course, some were happier than others, criticizing the lineup for being underwhelming.
I swear I’m not being a hater but Coachella lineup is mid 😁 lolol just my opinion tho pic.twitter.com/Y3AOWTd05U

“I’m honestly not one hundred percent happy with this lineup, I’m not going to lie,” said Tiktok user @alenaablack, who said she already bought tickets for this year’s festival. “The reason being: I’ve gone to Lollapalooza the last two years, and a lot of these artists were at Lollapalooza the last two years. And so it’s just really not a ton of new artists that I haven’t seen.”
What are your thoughts on the Coachella Lineup this year? Again, not saying I dont like the artists, its more the fact that I’ve seen them recently and so what new things would they realistically be able to bring?  . I am still excited though because there are artists I haven’t seen that I’m excited for and just the valley itself is a vibe . #coachella #coachella2024 #musicfestival #coachellalineup #greenscreen

And, already, there are theories about what special guests the headliners might bring with them, a surprise that has become festival tradition and has included names like Post Malone, 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Kendrick Lamar and a holograph of the late Tupac Shakur.
For Coachella I think:
Lana Del Rey brings out Taylor Swift. 
Jhene Aiko brings out Big Sean. 
Tyler can surprise us with anyone. 
Doja Cat will have the best production.
Purple Disco Machine will bring the best vibes. 
And ISOxo and Knock2 will be the best DJ set.
