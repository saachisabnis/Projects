In this clip, Comedian Donnell Rawlings shares his perspective on the divide Katt Williams created within the comedy community. He thinks many of the conversations Williams had with Shannon Sharpe were probably internal debates he's had with his friends, now brought to the public. Rawlings also talks about the loyalty of Williams's fans, noting that if you don't align with all of Williams's beliefs, youâ€™re considered a sellout. He compared Williams's fanbase to others he dealt with, such as Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, and identified them as having unparalleled loyalty. He named them "Kitty Cats" as they defended Williams regardless of the situation.
