Travis Kelce will be in Los Angeles on Sunday but not to attend the Golden Globes as Taylor Swift’s plus-one, according to Page Six. The singer is nominated for the show’s Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award for her Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert film. If she wins, it would be her first Golden Globe.
Multiple sources told Page Six that Travis will not be on the red carpet with Taylor, nor will he attend any after-parties with her. The Kansas City Chiefs player’s absence is completely understandable, as he is only in the California city to play against the Los Angeles Chargers.
That game begins at 4:25 P.M. ET, so 1:25 P.M. PT. The Golden Globes’ ceremony starts at 5 P.M. PT, making it highly unlikely Travis would be able to get to the theater immediately after finishing the game.
Additionally, Page Six’s sources said that Travis “will fly back to Kansas City with his team right after the game.”
Taylor attended Travis's last game against the Cincinnati Bengals on New Year’s Eve. New footage recently came out, showing her smiling excitedly when she spotted Travis on the field.
Travis spoke on his podcast, New Heights, this week about spending his New Year’s Eve with Taylor, his mother, Donna Kelce, and over 50 other friends and family members. Having his mom at the game “was fun,” he said. “And then we all got to celebrate New Year’s together.”
“It was cool man, to have all the friends and family,” he continued. “I think I had over 50, 55, people come in for this one.” It was a “good New Year’s celebration with all the friends and fam,” he added.
