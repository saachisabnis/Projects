Taylor Swift’s dad has got off scot-free after allegedly assaulting an Australian paparazzo during the superstar’s tour in Sydney last month.
Scott Swift, 72, will not be charged for the alleged Feb. 27 incident, New South Wales Police confirmed Tuesday to NCA NewsWire.
Papa Swift was accused of having hit Ben McDonald, who owns photo agency Matrix, at around 2:30 a.m. local time on a ferry wharf.
McDonald, 51, previously told the Sydney Morning Herald he “was just out on the job chasing” the “Anti-Hero” singer, 34, as “she got off a super-yacht … and walked up the wharf with an umbrella over her head and a couple of security [guards] around her.”
“Security sort of pushed us around with the umbrellas,” McDonald claimed. “Then her dad decided to add to the mix and throw a punch in. It was a shock … There was no need for it, the security had it under control.”
The Grammy winner’s camp had a different tune to sing, saying to multiple outlets at the time that “two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water.”
The spokesperson did not address the allegations directed at Scott at the time.
Though the situation was investigated by the North Shore Police Area Command officers, as NSW Police noted Tuesday, they ultimately decided against taking further action. The Herald initially reported that neither man had been injured.
Last month, the pop sensation’s record-breaking Eras Tour — the first to ever gross over $1 billion in revenue — hit Australia, playing seven shows between Sydney and Melbourne.
In addition to being the highest-grossing tour ever, Swift’s tour is the biggest to ever play in Australia, per the Herald, with the multi-hyphenate having played to an estimated 600,000 fans.
