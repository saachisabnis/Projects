Ice Spice is shooting down a fan's crappy theory about her. One of her followers recently reacted to a clip of her upcoming song and suggested the Bronx rapper has a "scat fetish." The allegation was brought up after Ice Spice rapped "Her man calling me baby/I'm his poopie like I need a diaper" in the unreleased song. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, April 16, the "Princess Diana" rapper dismissed the nasty theory. "atp we gotta ask if she got a scat fetish cuz what is with the poop, diaper, and fart bars?" the fan wrote. "i got a S**TTIN on b!tches fetish ðŸ˜‚," she replied. 
Ice Spice debuted the unreleased song from her upcoming Y2K album during her debut at Coachella. During her set, the Grammy-nominated artist performed her greatest hits like "Barbie World," "Princess Diana," and her remix of Taylor Swift's "Karma." She performed the upcoming track, which samples Sean Paul's 2005 hit "Gimme The Light," towards the end of her performance. The fan appeared to be over Ice Spice's poop-inspired lyrics in songs like "Deli," in which she calls herself "Miss Poopie," and â€œThink U The S**t (Fart)." The latter track was released earlier this year and serves as a response to Latto. The two artists have been sneak-dissing one another over the past year in various songs. Latto actually featured an image of Ice Spice on the cover art to her single "Sunday Service," which was believed to be a response to Ice Spice.
