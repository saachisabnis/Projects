Travis Kelce may be worth a pretty penny, but it doesn’t hold a candle to girlfriend Taylor Swift’s net worth — or her cats.
Olivia Benson, the “Lover” singer’s feline whom she adopted in 2014, is one of the world’s richest cats with an estimated net worth of $97 million.
According to a Forbes-style list of the world’s wealthiest pets compiled by the website AllAboutCats.com last week, the Scottish Fold “earned her fortune starring alongside her owner in several music videos.” 
The cat, named after Mariska Hargitay’s “Law & Order: SVU” character, has also “crafted her own merchandise line, and has had cameos in many big-budget ads, including for the likes of Diet Coke and Ned Sneakers,” the website noted.
The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, for his part, has an estimated 2024 net worth of $40 million.
Several fans took to TikTok in the wake of Olivia Benson’s net worth reveal, comparing her fortune to that of Swift’s new man. 
“If Travis is lucky, he’ll be as successful as TS’s cats one day,” one fan joked. 
“her cat has exponentially more money than I’ll see in my entire existance [sic],” another chimed in, while a third wrote, “that cat has more money than my entire family 😭.”

The two-time Super Bowl champion’s net worth is aided by several lucrative endorsement deals with companies like McDonald’s, Papa John’s, Nike and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
He also makes considerable cash from his salary, as he’s currently in the third year of a four-year $57.25 million deal he signed with the Chiefs.
The agreement included $22.75 million in guaranteed money, in addition to an annual salary of $14,312,500. However, Kelce has been outspoken about the fact he’s “underpaid.”
“My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am,” he told Vanity Fair in January 2023.
“Any time I talk about wanting more money, they’re just like, ‘Why don’t you go to the Chiefs and ask them?’” he went on.
“When I saw [former Chiefs receiver] Tyreek Hill go [to the Miami Dolphins] and get $30 [million] a year, in the back of my head, I was like, ‘Man, that’s two to three times what I’m making right now.’”
Swift, on the other hand, is believed to be worth a whopping $740 million — and counting — per Forbes, which is more than 24 times her new beau’s fortune.
