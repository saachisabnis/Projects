Speaking exclusively to The Mirror, celebrity psychic Inbaal Honnigman said that Taylor and Travis are "loving their relationship" now that both can enjoy some downtime. She added: "Taylor likes having time off."
Pulling the 9 of Cups card for Taylor, Inbaal told us this is a card that talks about happiness, filling your cup full of joy. "The singer's days 'off' are full of plans, friends, meetings, and even future song inspirations," she said."
Then, for Travis who "rests fully during his time off", Inbaal pulled the VIII Adjustment card that shows stillness and balance. "The athlete's time off is perfectly restful, and he'll engage in calming activities like long walks, gym trips and 7-course dinners," she noted.
Inbaal then said: "Together, they couldn't be happier," adding how she pulled the Universe Tarot card, also known as The World, which is the highest card in the Tarot, and signifies luck and unbridled joy. "They both waited for this moment," she concluded.
This comes after a source recently told US Weekly: "They can finally rest and intend on spending quality time together and with friends and family." The insider added that Taylor likes hosting "small, intimate gatherings" with her closest friends at home.
The couple are also said to be "scheduling" their project to maximise their time together as they "don't want to spend too much time apart." The source also said the pair want to go on "a private vacation" at the end of the month "where no one can find them" before her new album drops.
