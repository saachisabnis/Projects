WATFORD CITY, N.D. — When my husband and I were freshmen in college at the University of North Dakota, I used to visit him in his small, stinky dorm room in Walsh Hall, and he would make me tuna salad sandwiches.
This seems like a silly way to start things off, but every single one of us is living in the ordinary, everyday moments, and February has drug on and brought us to March and more routine, and I think I have something to say here …

Recently, our little routine has been intercepted by a home remodeling project. Our plans, homework and furniture are covered in a layer of sawdust as the girls and I help my husband where we can between work and school, laying flooring, handing him tools, holding boards and picking playlists (heavy on the Taylor Swift). He’s been working hard to finish a project that, for so many reasons — some in and some out of our control — has drug on through the years. 
It’s finally time to wrap it up, so here we are, working supper around hammers on the kitchen table and evening snuggles next to the table saw.
This house of ours seems to be a structure changing and growing along with our lives together. Maybe only a poet could draw the comparison eloquently, but when it was just the two of us, new in our marriage, it stood as a brand-new cozy cottage in this valley full of hand-me-down furniture and the dreams we had for our lives here. 
I remember the first night we spent together in this house. The waterline hadn’t been dug yet and our upstairs bedroom still had walls to put up, so we lived downstairs in what was going to be the guest room. We just lay there, side by side, looking up at the stars out the new window with no blinds.
Fast forward through the years, and those two extra bedrooms are now home to dozens of stuffed animals, puzzles, games, art supplies, night lights, baby dolls, 20 to 25 Barbies, a couple Kens, one Christoph, and their dream wardrobe/house/barn/car/camper.
When we were in the planning phases of this house, we didn’t have children, and I wondered if we would regret the staircase or the hardwood flooring if they arrived. Then my friend reminded me that they would only be babies for a blink of an eye, and that you make your space what it needs to be along the way. And so here we are taking that phrase quite literally, adding an entryway to catch the mud, cow poop and the occasional bottle calf at the pass. 
We’ve added a pantry, too, because out here so far from the grocery store, you need to have more on hand. Which led us to where we are now, expanding our living and dining room so we have more space to host gatherings and holidays, putting our bedroom back on the main floor and turning that old bedroom loft into an office space for all the paperwork that piles up when you find yourself smack dab in the middle of middle age.

It seems ridiculous and over the top when I lay it out here, our little cottage in its first form would have worked perfectly fine for us through any stage. But looking back, I doubt we could have helped ourselves given my propensity to dream and his to make things. And that’s how we’re in what is turning out to be, after all these years, a quite beautiful sawdust-covered predicament.
Which brings me to the tuna salad sandwich my husband made last weekend during a break between laying the floor and me taking the girls to 4-H. I sat at the kitchen counter and talked with him about grocery lists and schedules and mundane things you only say out loud to someone you’re married to because they listen in a way that’s sort of not listening and that’s just what you need sometimes. 
While I chattered, he made his way around the kitchen gathering ingredients and carefully chopping and mixing — the tuna, the celery, then the onions, followed by the mayo, the mustard, the salt and pepper and some other things I’m sure I didn’t catch. I looked up and joked, “You sure make a big fuss over a sandwich,” to which he replied, "If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right." 
And it was that ordinary moment in the middle of February in the middle of marriage in the middle of our lives that flipped the mundane to affection and then to deep gratitude.
He handed me a plate with two slices of toast, and offered, as he always does, for me to serve myself first before he stirs in the jalapenos. I guess what I’m trying to say is that sometimes we look for love and forever in heart-shaped boxes when maybe the best of all of it is hidden among the years of tuna fish sandwiches and sawdust.
That’s all. That’s all I wanted to say. If you need me, I’ll be sweeping and then vacuuming and then sweeping again …
