Good morning, folks. There’s a total solar eclipse today. Here’s who has the best chance for clear skies (and scroll down for a full guide to the rare celestial event). Now, on to the news.

Next steps: Before the plan can be implemented by the Department of Education, it will have to go through a public comment period and may face legal challenges. [CNN]

What do you need to know about today’s solar eclipse? I asked Dylan Stableford, who wrote a guide on what to expect, to break it down before you head outside.
Dylan: Because we haven’t had that many. Only 13 total solar eclipses have been visible in the U.S. in the past century. The next one, in Alaska, won’t occur until 2033. And we won’t see one in the contiguous U.S. again until 2044.
Dylan: It depends where you are along the path of totality. In Texas, it’ll begin at around 1:40 p.m. local time. In Maine, it’ll be closer to 3:30. It’s expected to last about four minutes.
Dylan: Here’s one thing: If you're in the path of totality, look for bright streams of light around the edges of the sun during totality. That’s the corona, the sun’s ultra hot outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface.
