Taylor Swift has a surprising connection to iconic American poet Emily Dickinson. Ancestry, the genealogy company, conducted a heritage test and discovered that Swift and Dickinson are actually sixth cousins, three times removed. It turns out they both descend from a 17th century English immigrant who settled in Windsor, Connecticut.
This connection between Swift and Dickinson is intriguing, especially considering Swift's admiration for 19th century poets like Dickinson, which she has subtly referenced in her recent albums. Her upcoming record is even called The Tortured Poets Department.
