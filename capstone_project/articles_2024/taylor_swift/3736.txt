Bet you never thought you'd hear Keith Urban and Snoop Dogg together on a song.
The two have teamed up to record a track for the Garfield Movie, which is set to be released on May 24.
"Let It Roll" has Urban mostly handling the vocal duties, with Snoop Dogg dropping in for a verse in the middle of the song.
"Out of the blue, I got a call from Garfield asking if I'd sing and play a song for his movie," Urban says playfully in a social media post.
The Garfield Movie will see the legendary cat reuniting with his long-lost father as he and his dog friend Odie go on an adventure. There will likely be some lasagna consumed along the way.
The animated movie features the voices of Chris Pratt and Samuel L. Jackson. Snoop Dogg is also set to voice a character named Snoop Catt.
Urban says working with Snoop was "super cool," but it would have been even better to have Garfield himself in the studio for the recording session.
"He said no. Huge bummer. Apparently, the guy hates Mondays," the country star jokes.
While this may seem like an unexpected pairing, it is far from the first time Snoop Dogg has teamed up with a country artist.
In 2021, Snoop was featured on the Trace Adkins song "So Do the Neighbors." He also did a quick guest spot on Brad Paisley's 2008 album Play.
Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson have more expectedly collaborated on several projects that started with the rapper's 2008 song, "My Medicine." Four years later, the duo would team up with Kris Kristofferson and Jamey Johnson to record "Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die."
Earlier this year, Snoop Dogg expressed interest in working with Dolly Parton on an upcoming collaboration.
