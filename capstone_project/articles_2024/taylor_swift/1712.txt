Taylor Swift has once again demonstrated her generosity and compassion by making significant donations to support the family of Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a beloved Kansas City DJ who tragically lost her life in a mass shooting.
Swift's representative confirmed to Variety that the singer-songwriter contributed $100,000 to the GoFundMe campaign established for Lopez-Galvan's family following the devastating incident outside Union Station.
The GoFundMe aimed to raise $75,000 to aid Lopez-Galvan's husband of 22 years and her two children. However, thanks to the overwhelming support from donors, the fund has far surpassed its original goal, surpassing $194,000 in 24 hours.
Lopez-Galvan, 43, was fatally shot while celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl victory with her family. She was a prominent figure in the community, known for her role as a DJ on local radio station KKFI-FM, where she hosted the popular program "Taste of Tejano."
Swift might be on tour in Melbourne, Australia, but that didn't stop her from making not one but two donations to the GoFundMe. Her notes accompanying the donations expressed deepest sympathies and condolences to the grieving family.
The tragic incident occurred during what was started as a joyful celebration of the Chiefs' victory and quickly took a turn for the worst.Â Two juveniles have been apprehended in connection with the mass shooting, according to police reports.
Lopez-Galvan's son, Marc Lopez-Galvan, was among the injured but has since been discharged from the hospital, while her teenage daughter narrowly escaped harm. The community has rallied around the Lopez-Galvan family, offering support and solidarity during this difficult time.
