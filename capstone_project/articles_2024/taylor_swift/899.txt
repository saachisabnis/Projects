SEDALIA, Mo. (Gray News) – A group of seniors at a retirement community in Missouri is proving you’re never too old to be a Swiftie.
In a video posted Friday, residents at the Primrose Retirement Community in Sedalia dressed in Kansas City Chiefs gear and held signs in support of Taylor Swift.
Sedalia is located about 90 miles east of Kansas City.
The group calls themselves the Primrose Sedalia Chiefs Cheerleaders.
Video shows residents dancing along to “Swag Surfin’” by F.L.Y. and holding signs that say, “Senior Swifties,” “I’m a Swiftie,” and cheering on Travis Kelce and other Chiefs players.
The video was taken ahead of the playoff game Sunday in which the Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 27-24.
The Primrose Sedalia Chiefs Cheerleaders are hoping their team makes it to the Super Bowl.
The Chiefs play the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday for the NFL Conference Championships. The winner will advance to the Super Bowl.
