Football fans and quite a few non-football fans alike are wondering if a touring Taylor Swift will be able to attend the Super Bowl in Las Vegas to cheer on boyfriend Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce as his team takes on the San Francisco 49ers. The answer is yes, it is possible. Here’s how:
— Swift is slated to play her final Eras Tour show in Tokyo on Feb. 10, the day before the Super Bowl.
— The show will most likely end around midnight the day of the game on Feb. 11, but Japan is also 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas.
— The flight time from Tokyo to Las Vegas is about 13 hours, putting Swift potentially in Las Vegas Saturday night in plenty of time before kickoff at Allegiant Stadium Sunday at 3 p.m. PT.
Swift’s presence at Chiefs games this season has both delighted and upset fans, and it’s becoming apparent the music phenom is not crazy about the attention TV networks give her during the game. Most recently during the AFC Championship game between the Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens, Swift appears to give the cameras an icy stare when they shoot to her in the second quarter of the game.
