We’re a couple of days away from one of the most highly-anticipated concerts in Singapore in 2024: Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour. However, there’s no rule saying that the excitement can only start on her first show on Mar 2.
Multiple organisations and spaces here are holding Taylor Swift-themed events for fans to interact and revel in Swiftmania in the days leading up to Swift’s six shows in Singapore.
So whether you’re a local Swiftie looking to get a head start on exchanging friendship bracelets or someone from overseas trying to make new friends here, check out these Taylor Swift-themed events that will make your sparks fly.
1. THE ERAS TOUR TRAIL, LIGHT & WATER SHOW AND POP-UP STORE AT MARINA BAY SANDS
Many Swifties who are flying to Singapore for this concert have told us that they’ll be visiting Marina Bay Sands (MBS) during their stay here. Well, the good news is that there is now more incentive to visit the spot as MBS is adding a bit more style with their Taylor Swift trail, light & water show and pop-up store.
The trail comprises seven walkthrough installations across The Shoppes and Sands Expo & Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands – all of which are inspired by Taylor Swift’s 10 eras. Here, fans can enjoy Instagram-worthy photo opportunities for free. Do note that the installations can only be accessed from 10.30am to 10pm till Mar 13.
While you’re at MBS, don’t forget to check out its signature light and water show which will have its own “Taylor’s Version”. The display will be choreographed to four of Swift’s songs and will last for about 15 minutes. Expect dancing fountain jets, vibrant visual projections, beaming lasers and synchronised lava effects.
Although the event is free, fans who want to access the lower deck of the Event Plaza to catch the show will have to register via this website to secure a spot.
Finally, fans who do not want to wait till Mar 2 to secure their merch can head down to MBS’ The Eras Tour pop-up store from Feb 29 to purchase official themed T-shirts, hoodies, water bottles, tote bags and bracelets. Do note that you’ll have to register for a time slot to buy the merchandise before coming.
However, fans who are unable to get slots to enter the pop-up store can head to the Sports Hub on selected days to buy their merch. There will be multiple booths around the space selling the likes of posters, tapestries, pullover jackets and more.
