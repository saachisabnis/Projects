Shed Seven live in Manchester, Dec 21 (Gary Mather for Live4ever)
Shed Seven have topped the UK Record Store Chart with A Matter Of Time.
During a typically quiet time at the start of the year, the only other new release in the Top 20 comes from Sprints’ essential debut LP Letter To Self, while Smashing Pumpkins are a re-entry thanks to Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness.
Further back, there’s a 12th week on the chart for The Rolling Stones and Hackney Diamonds, while the familiar sight of OK Computer is on display again at #18.
