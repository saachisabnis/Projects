How's your morning commute to Boise treating you? If it feels like a daily struggle, you're not alone.

This isn't just a passing complaint anymore; it's a cold, hard fact. Let’s just say, when it comes to the best and worst states to drive in, it isn't looking very good for Idaho.
Some locals might view this as a call to action, urging fellow Idahoans to "be better!" On the flip side, there are those who might secretly think, "Good! Maybe this will deter people from moving here."
The goal should always be a safe commute to and from work. Sadly, Idaho's current state of driving is not making that journey any easier. A recent report from The Hill reveals the best and worst states for driving. Let's look at the findings for Idaho.
