Solvay, N.Y — Libraries throughout the Onondaga County Public Library System have their own programs for the community to enjoy.
At the Solvay Library they think outside the box to keep kids engaged.
Brian Rowlands, Solvay Library Manager said, “Every third Monday of the month we do a Pokémon night where kids bring in their cards, we show cartoons and play games and stuff.”
Whenever there is a break from school the library fills the week with themes and activities.
“Winter break we are having a hunger games, library hunger games on that Wednesday at 4 o' clock and then showing the new movie a ballad of songbirds and snakes, we have the strong museum from Rochester coming in that Friday, that Thursday we are having a Taylor Swift dance party, that Monday is our Pokémon night like always and every
Kids involvement has grown in recent years and a lot of themes come straight for the kids.
“Every time I go to the school I ask them what do you guys like, what do you guys want to see and they shoot me ideas and I try to figure out a way to do it.”
Every library has their own themes and activities so contact you local branch for more information and if you want to participate in another branch’s activity contact them for more information.
