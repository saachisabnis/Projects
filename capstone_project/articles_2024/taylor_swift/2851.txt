Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” ascends to the top 10 on Billboard’s all-format Radio Songs chart (dated March 23).

	The track advances to No. 10, from No. 12, with 40 million impressions, up 11%, March 8-14, according to Luminate. It drew airplay on nearly 575 stations in the tracking week – the most of any song on the survey.

	Here’s a rundown of the performance of “Texas Hold ‘Em,” which is being promoted to multiple formats, on the latest Billboard radio rankings:

	The song, released Feb. 11, spent two weeks atop the all-genre, multimetric Billboard Hot 100 and adds a fifth week atop the March 23-dated Hot Country Songs chart.

	Beyoncé’s new album, Cowboy Carter, arrives March 29. “It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history,” she shared on her official Instagram page on Tuesday (March 19). “The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me.” The new LP “is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.”

	Beyoncé ups her solo career count to 21 Radio Songs top 10s. She first reached the region as featured on Jay-Z’s “’03 Bonnie & Clyde” in 2002 and had last appeared in the tier with “Cuff It” in 2022-23; both songs hit No. 4. She ties Justin Bieber for the fourth-most top 10s, dating to the chart’s 1990 launch, after Rihanna (30), Drake (24) and Mariah Carey (23). Lil Wayne and Taylor Swift follow with 20 each.

	Plus, Destiny’s Child, with Beyoncé as a member, tallied 10 Radio Songs top 10s in 1999-2005.
