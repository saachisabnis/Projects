Noah Kahan is officially the No. 1 songwriter in the U.S., as he tops Billboard’s Hot 100 Songwriters chart (dated Feb. 10) for the first time.

	Kahan rises 2-1 thanks to two writing credits on the Hot 100: “Stick Season,” on which he’s the sole credited writer, at No. 12, and “Northern Attitude” with Hozier (co-written with Gabe Simon) at No. 97.

	Kahan also tops Alternative Songwriters for a 14th week and Rock & Alternative Songwriters for a fourth frame.

	“Stick Season” has been steadily climbing the Hot 100 since it debuted in October – even though Kahan released it in 2022. It reaches a new high on the latest list with 16.3 million official streams (up 3%), 11.8 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 28%), and 2,000 downloads sold (up 20%) in the U.S. Jan. 26-Feb. 1, according to Luminate.

	The track’s parent album of the same name has also maintained a steady presence on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It places at No. 4 on the newest ranking with 47,000 equivalent album units, nearly matching its No. 3 high reached in June.

	Rounding out the top five on Hot 100 Songwriters, surging Latin music artist Xavi rises 3-2 thanks to his work on “La Diabla” (No. 22 on the Hot 100; co-written with Alex Hernandez) and “La Victima” (No. 53; sole writer); Zach Bryan ranks at No. 3 powered by “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves (No. 6; co-written with Musgraves), and “Oklahoma Smokeshow” (No. 86; sole writer); Tracy Chapman places at No. 4 via Luke Combs’ cover of her classic “Fast Car” (No. 20; sole writer); and Jack Antonoff is No. 5 thanks to his work on Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” (No. 3; co-written with Swift and Annie Clark) and “Is It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault]” (No. 21; co-written with Swift).

	Billboard’s weekly Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts are based on total points accrued by a songwriter and producer, respectively, for each attributed song that appears on the Hot 100. As with Billboard’s yearly recaps, multiple writers or producers split points for each song equally (and the dividing of points will lead to occasional ties on rankings). Billboard launched its Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts, as well as genre-specific rankings for country, rock & alternative, R&B/hip-hop, R&B, rap, Latin, Christian, gospel and dance/electronic in June 2019. Alternative and hard rock joined in 2020, along with seasonal holiday rankings in 2022.
