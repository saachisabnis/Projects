For those who love the Jersey Shore and cannot wait for Summer 2024 to get here, there have been more shows added to the schedule of Summer Concerts that you can check out in South Jersey this year.
Since 1929, the Ocean City Music Pier has been the venue to host numerous concerts every summer and is a South Jersey Landmark. Located on the Ocean City Boardwalk off Moorlyn Terrance (between 8th and 9th streets), the performance hall that is almost 100 years old has been the site for musical performances by Jason Mraz, John Oats, The Bacon Brothers, Switchfoot, and Arlo Guthrie.
The original slate for the 2024 Summer Concert series was for 11 shows but two more musical acts have been added to the schedule. The British Band 10cc, who came to fame in the 1970s, will be performing at the Ocean City Music Pier on Monday, July 29th.  Also added to the summer slate of shows is The Machine who will perform their Pink Floyd show on Monday, August 19th.
