A die-hard Kansas City Chiefs fan transformed his Riverside, Missouri, front yard into a "shrine" for the team and its athletes, including Patrick Mahomes.
But others are also present in Jeff Parson's yard, like Jason Kelce, Taylor Swift and Andy Reid, and he has a reason for all of them.
When asked about the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift romance, he said:
"I thought that was great. C'mon, if you've got a problem with it, there's something wrong with you."
Another iconic moment this season was Jason Kelce.
"After the Buffalo game, aren't we all Jason Kelce," Parson said.
Other players are also displayed in his lawn, like Chris Jones and Isaiah Pacheco.
"The man can run. I mean, he's amazing," Parson said.
However, Parson said it always starts with Big Red.
"He's like the first ornament on the Christmas tree. Every year he's the one because he's kinda the anchor of the team. The whole thing gets created around that."
At least 50 people have been out to Parson's lawn, including some from out of state.
Joe and Kelley McCarthy drove from Olathe, Kansas, just to see it.
"We wanted to get out of the house and come see it. I love, like, Chris Jones, all of them actually," Kelley said.
"I don't know if I'm good at it, it's just something I really enjoy doing," Parson said.
