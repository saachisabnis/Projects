The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers reveal that Mishael Morgan (Amanda Sinclair) recently announced some huge news and got fans excited about what’s ahead in Genoa City. On Instagram, Morgan revealed that she was back at the studio in a new video that included Taylor Swift’s “…Ready For It?”
Of course, many viewers are indeed ready to see Mishael Morgan again, so it was nice to get updates on her upcoming return stint.
Based on the wardrobe tag Morgan showed off in the video, we know she’s stepping back into Amanda Sinclair’s shoes, not Hilary Curtis Hamilton’s.
Just in case you thought Hilary might be rising from the grave, it’s best not to get your hopes about that – at least during this particular trip back to GC.
Unfortunately, Morgan won’t be sticking around long-term, but we’ll take what we can get when it comes to this beloved and talented actress.
“Guess who’s popping in for a visit!!! #YR @youngandrestlesscbs,” Morgan said in her Instagram caption.
It’ll be wonderful to see Amanda back on canvas, but who will she share scenes with?
There’s no confirmation on Amanda’s story details just yet, but Melissa Ordway (Abby Newman-Abbott) hinted about a possible Amanda and Abby interaction.
“Love our Amanda/ Abby dynamic,” Ordway said in the comments before adding three emoji hearts.
It’s possible Ordway was just referring to Abby and Amanda’s dynamic in the past, but it’d be great if they could share scenes again – especially now that Abby’s relationship with Devon Hamilton-Winters (Bryton James) has deepened even further.
Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) is also in desperate need of a friend, so let’s hope Amanda checks on her and perhaps offers some advice.
It’s clear that Phyllis needs to stop chasing after Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) like a wild teenager, so maybe Amanda can talk some sense into her!
Amanda isn’t someone who usually sugarcoats anything, so she might give Phyllis the tough love she needs as they catch up.
Whatever the case, Tracey E. Bregman (Lauren Fenmore Baldwin) is pleased about Mishael Morgan’s comeback if her Instagram comment is any indication.
“Yay!!” Bregman posted along with a trio of emoji hearts.
It’ll be fun to see exactly why Amanda Sinclair comes back to Y&R and whether her legal expertise might be required.
The Young and the Restless spoilers say some hot drama’s ahead no matter what, so stay tuned!
