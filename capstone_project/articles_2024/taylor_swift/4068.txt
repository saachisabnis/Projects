Universal Music Group boss Sir Lucian Grainge, the Londoner who worked his way up to the top of the global entertainment industry, landed a pay package of €139 million (£120 million) last year.
Grainge, 64, has signed and worked with some of the world’s biggest stars, including Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Rihanna and the Rolling Stones. He has been credited with boosting the music industry by striking transformational licensing deals with tech giants such as Spotify and YouTube. Bill Ackman, whose investment firm Pershing Square owns 10 per cent of Universal, has compared Grainge to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs.
Los Angeles-based Grainge has now been paid more than €450 million in shares, cash and benefits since Vivendi, the French conglomerate, spun off Universal
