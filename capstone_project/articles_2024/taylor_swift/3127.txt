From 2018 to wedding rumours
Celeb couples come in all forms - from the super open, to those who prefer to remain more private. Falling into the latter group: actors Robert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse, who've always kept things under wraps. 
Finally, after four years of dating, the pair made their red carpet debut in 2023, and have since gone on to welcome their first child together.  
But where did it all begin? (And why have we hardly seen anything from these two before?!) Here's a look back at their relationship timeline in full, starting with the most recent update...

Now, an insider tip at DeuxMoi shares they got married in the Caribbean on New Year's Eve, which an unverified submission reading: "Robert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse got married at NYE at the Caribbean resort I work at!!! They were so cute and sweet, their baby was there in a gorgeous little bridesmaids dress."
