Our article: 'Nicole Kidman won court battle against photographer who accused Taylor Swift’s dad of assault' incorrectly reported that Nicole Kidman was 'awarded a restraining order against freelance photographer Ben McDonald' and had 'won a court battle against him' after 'a listening device from the pair was found on her Sydney property'. This was incorrect. Although Ms Kidman was granted a temporary restraining order against Mr McDonald, the application for an Apprehended Personal Violence Order against Mr McDonald was formally withdrawn by Police in March 2005, and Mr McDonald absolutely denied emphatically that he had anything to do with planting any listening device anywhere near Miss Kidman’s home.
There was no court battle between Ben McDonald and Nicole Kidman. We are happy to clarify this and apologise to Mr McDonald for the error.
