Emotions ran high yesterday as one of the most popular players in the NFL right now announced his retirement after 13 seasons. Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce even brought his brother, Kansas City Chiefs standout Travis Kelce, to tears as he announced he’s hanging up his cleats.
But fans of Travis’ girlfriend, pop megastar Taylor Swift, think they’ve seen some nods to her in the tearful goodbye. “It’s only too poetic I found my career being fulfilled in the city of brotherly love, I knew that relationship all too well,” said the Super Bowl-winning center, maybe quoting Swift’s single “All Too Well?”
But it’s the second quote that seems to confirm fans’ speculation. “If you go above and beyond in this city,” the 36-year-old continued. “You will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams.” Many are saying this is a nod to the star’s hit “Wildest Dreams.” It looks like the now-retired athlete might be turning to his brother’s girlfriend for inspiration as he bids fans farewell.
