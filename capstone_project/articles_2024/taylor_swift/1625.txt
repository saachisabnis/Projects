Taylor Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce has concerned some of the singer’s fans after he was filmed shouting at his coach during the Super Bowl 2024. 
Last night saw the Kansas City Chiefs triumph over the San Francisco 49ers, with the former’s tight end Kelce, 34, celebrating the big win by kissing his pop sensation girlfriend, also 34. 
Pictures emerged from the evening of the pair enjoying each other’s company, as the Getaway Car hitmaker chugged down a beer and cheered on her beau from the crowd alongside pal Blake Lively. 
But while many of the Las Vegas scenes were happy, the heat of the game threw up a different side to Kelce for Swifties, as he was seen shouting at and shoving coach Andy Reid. 
Footage shows Travis getting into Andy’s face, barking at him when the Chiefs struggled to build momentum in the first half, and the coach actually lost balance with the impact of the shove. 
Reid had decided to remove Kelce in a play that saw Isiah Pacheco fumble, and the Chiefs star’s frustration boiled over, with Jerick McKinnon forced to pull his team-mate away.
Speaking to the media after the match, Reid joked that the 6 ft 5 tight end had hit him with a ‘cheap shot’.
‘He caught me off balance, I wasn’t watching. Cheap shot! That’s alright, he did good!’ Reid said.
‘He was really coming over just to go, “Put me in, I’ll score!”, so that’s really what it was.
‘Well I love that. It’s not the first time. Listen, I appreciate him.’
‘Then he came over and gave me a hug and said, “Sorry about that,”’ he told ESPN after the game. 
‘But you know what? He just wants to be on the field and he wants to play. And, so, there’s nobody I get better than I get him. He’s a competitive kid. You know, he loves to play and he makes me feel young.’ 
After the game, when asked about the heated moment, Kelce joked: ‘I’m going to keep it between us unless my mic’d up tells the world, but I was just telling him how much I love him.’ 
While coach Andy might be used to this treatment, Swifties were less than impressed at the frustrated outburst from Kelce, as many posted about the moment being a big red flag. 
‘Travis Kelce is a red flag. That aggression isn’t what Taylor needs,’ @StickaMANIA said. 
Yo Travis Kelce  – we donât care if you are dating Taylor Swiftâ¦ this isnât cool. You donât yell at coach Andy Reid #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/ani8fZoR2k
‘And just like that I’m suddenly less excited about Travis Kelce. You don’t get to ape up someone all aggressive like just because you’re frustrated. Taylor, my darling, my dove, my lamb, this is a big red flag,’ wrote @KierstenWarren in a viral post. 
‘It’s weird to me that this moment has become a meme,’ began @PeaceRelations on X, formerly Twitter. 
‘All I see is a grown man who aggressively and extremely unprofessionally unleashed his anger at his coach on live TV. Red flags galore, but we’re all just laughing it off for some reason.’ 
Others pointed out the different in statures between Kelce and Reid, and said how this power imbalance made the moment worse. 
‘Travis Kelce assaulted his elderly coach Andy Reed on live television during #SuperBowl,’ said @PatriotGeo. 
‘Inability to control his emotions ending in physicality. Redflags for Taylor Swift.’ 
‘Travis Kelce’s temper is a huge red flag but y’all aren’t ready for that conversation,’ said @valleyhuds, nodding to how the whole world seemed to be fawning over the pair serenading Swift’s early classic Love Story to one another at the afterparty. 
Others were more sympathetic, and put the outburst down to the pressure of the event. 
‘Could Travis Kelce’s meltdown be a red flag for gross behavior? Absolutely. Could it also be that he was emotional being in a high stakes game? Absolutely,’ @xo_rilee said. 
‘He looked like an athlete who made a mistake and got benched in a career defining game. If there are other instances outside game environment, be concerned then.’ 
Swift seems smitten with Kelce, as she flew from Tokyo – clocking up some controversial air miles of late – in order to watch the big game. 
The pair got together in summer, and in recent months have become increasingly open about their relationship, with PDA coming thick and fast.
