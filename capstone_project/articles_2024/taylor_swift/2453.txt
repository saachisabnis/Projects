CHARLOTTE, N.C. – You can now get into business with Beyonce, Taylor Swift or the Gin Blossoms.
JKBX, the music investing startup, is offering people the chance to purchase securities linked to a musical performer’s streaming royalties.
According to the company’s website, every time a song is played on the radio, the grocery store or anywhere, royalties are handed out.
This service from JKBX allows the general public to get in on the deal.
However, analysts will warn you that most investors are not going to get a whole lot from this arrangement.
