Jason Kelce nailed it on the latest episode of theÂ New Heights podcast with Saquon Barkley on Wednesday: "You just throw it out there ... stuff happens when it goes out on New Heights. Speak it into existence!"
And here's the context: Travis Kelce and Jason were talking to new Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, who talked about boxing in a movie and how maybe he could be the next Apollo Creed. That's when Jason said the quote above. And his brother Travis just had to laugh, because he threw out on the podcast last July that he tried to give Taylor Swift his phone number on a friendship bracelet.
You know what happened next! He's right!
