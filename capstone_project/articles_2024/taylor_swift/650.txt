Have we uncovered Taylor Swift's favorite perfume? The Chiefs fan who was gifted Taylor's scarf from the singer at last weekend's Chiefs-Dolphins game, Beth Vancil, shared with Ryan Seacrest she thinks Taylor wears the same Jo Malone scent as her. Jo Malone Scarlett Poppy to be exact.
ICYMI, Taylor was seated directly behind Beth and her friend Betsy during the game. The "Cruel Summer" singer was hanging out with Beth and celebrating with her each touchdown. She gifted Beth her scarf and said she was her “good luck charm.” When asked about the scarf Beth said “it smelled like home.”
"I think we wear the same perfume," Beth explained to Seacrest. "Jo Malone Poppy. ... I swear this is the one that last's the longest. It's in the red bottle."
Beth added that Tay was as down to Earth as she appears.
"It was just fun. She was relaxed and at the end of the game my face was as red as one can imagine ... and she goes, 'You're our good luck charm. You need to have this scarf.' And she wrapped it around me."
