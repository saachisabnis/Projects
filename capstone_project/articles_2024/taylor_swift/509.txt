Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford did not looked amused by Chelsea Handler calling them 'smokeshows' in her opening monologue at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards on Sunday.
The Hollywood legends, who are both more than three decades her senior, seemed unimpressed by the 48-year-old comedian's jokes about preferring men that have 'been alive since the railway was invented.' 
The New Jersey native proceeded to namedrop the Oscar winner, 80, and Indiana Jones star, 81, as she mused that she prefers her 'men old' and was 'looking' right at 'Robert Deniro and Harrison.'
'I don't know which one of you is more of a smokeshow, but you both have been so hot for decades and just keep getting hotter. It's enough already. I know you're both spoken for, so I'm not hitting on you. But I am hitting on you,' she told the actors.

Poking fun: The New Jersey native proceeded to namedrop the Oscar winner, 80, and Indiana Jones star, 81, as she mused that she prefers her 'men old' and was 'looking' right at 'Robert Deniro and Harrison'
Social media users were quick to point out that the joke did not land with the men, particularly Ford, who noticeably recoiled.
'Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford look like they would rather be anywhere but there,' one X user wrote on the platform previously known as X. 
'The way Harrison Ford cringed when Chelsea Handler said she has the hots for him — YIKES!' another viewer wrote. 
Another pointed out: 'Harrison Ford Is NOT amused by Chelsea Handler.' 
A third chimed in: 'It was SOOOOO uncomfy!!!!! Glad I’m not the only one who noticed!!'
Despite the backlash, Handler proceeded to confess her feelings for Ford, who she admitted made her a 'flustered Barbie.' 
Before welcoming him on stage to accept the Career Achievement Award, the host admitted that the father-of-five has been 'revving' her 'hormones up' since hitting 'puberty at the age of 8.'
De Niro is currently in a relationship with Tiffany Chen, who welcomed a baby girl named Gia Virginia Chen with the actor in April 2023, while Ford has been happily married to Calista Flockhart since 2010.

Overall, Handler's raunchy opening monologue was a hit with viewers and attendees, who couldn't help but laugh as she took a jab at her ex-boyfriend, Jo Koy, 52, following his recent Golden Globes flop.
After she got the audience laughing by saying she would 'toss' legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, 81, like 'a little Italian meatball' she quipped, 'thank you for laughing at that. My writers wrote it.' 
It was a pointed remark at Koy, who notoriously blamed his writers onstage after failing to get laughs from the Golden Globes audience, saying, 'I wrote some of these and they're the ones you're laughing at.'
During her opener Handler also joked about Saltburn star Barry Keoghan's manhood and referenced Meg Ryan's famous orgasm scene from When Harry Met Sally.
At one point in her opener, she stated: 'And now, it's time to talk about the horniest movie of the year Saltburn' as the camera panned to Keoghan.
'There he is. Barry Keoghan was horny for men, women, bath water, and cemeteries.'
'Featuring men in various states of undress. Most male actors use prosthetics, so thank you, Barry, for keeping it real, and please thank your penis for its service,' she added.
She then praised Barbie star Margot Robbie: 'By the way, Margot Robbie produced Saltburn, so you're a dirty Barbie, and I like it. Which means Margot is responsible for not one, but two spirited dance numbers this year.'
Chelsea joked that '2023 was one of the horniest years for movies and TV. Everybody was horny for everything. Ali Wong was horny in Beef, Rachel Sennott was horny in Bottoms, Leonardo Dicaprio and Robert De Niro were horny for land, Cillian Murphy was horny for uranium, and 2023 was the year that everyone became horny for Pedro Pascal.'
'And, of course, in Poor Things, Emma Stone was horny for an apple and pretty much anything else that came her way.'
That brought Chelsea to Meg Ryan's famous scene from the 1989 rom-com classic, as she quipped: 'That movie had so many on-screen orgasms even Meg Ryan was like, take it down a notch, girl. You're not in a deli.'
Well done: Overall, Handler's raunchy opening monologue was a hit with viewers and attendees, who couldn't help but laugh as she took a jab at her ex-boyfriend, Jo Koy, 52, following his recent Golden Globes flop
'Kudos to Chelsea Handler for the "thank you for laughing at it, my writers wrote it" slap at Jo Koy's Golden Globes BS,' one X user wrote
'Chelsea Handler is a gift to this industry and is a perfect example of a comedian who does the work and gets the job done,' one viewer raved
Another said: 'All I wanted to see tonight was a subtle diss at Jo Koy and Chelsea delivered in the first 10 minutes'
She also addressed Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy calling him 'atomic-bomb Ken.'
'I don't want to reduce anyone's work here tonight to their sex appeal, but I see you over there, you peaky little blinder. I know you're not old, but you will be someday, and I'll be waiting.'
Later she kept the laughs coming by turning to Bradley Cooper as she congratulated him for doing an amazing job of Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.
'Bradley spent 6 years preparing for this role, learning to conduct. I'm not sure what he's doing over there tonight, but I guess we'll find out in 2030,' she joked.
Chelsea started out her monologue telling the audience: 'Tonight, we're here to celebrate all the brilliant movies and TV shows in 2023 that didn't get shelved for a tax write-off.'
She went on: 'We've all been through a lot this year and I don't intend to put you through more, so think of me as your good time doula. There's a party growing inside of you and I'm here to help you birth it.'
She then referenced the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes, telling the audience: 'Of course, nobody had a harder time this year than studio executives who were forced to vacation for six consecutive months in a row. But the strikes are over and we are back and better than ever.'
Subtle jab: After she got the audience laughing by saying she would 'toss' legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, 81, like 'a little Italian meatball' she quipped, 'thank you for laughing at that. My writers wrote it'
Clever: It was a pointed remark at Koy, who notoriously blamed his writers onstage after failing to get laughs from the Golden Globes audience, saying, 'I wrote some of these and they're the ones you're laughing at'
Chelsea went on to proclaim that 'this was a huge year for women' while poking fun of Gwyneth Paltrow.
'Women were victorious in all venues Barbie at the box office, Taylor Swift and Beyonce on their tours, Gwyneth Paltrow in that ski trial.'
'This year proved that when given the opportunity, women show up for each other and dominate the culture. You could almost say it was the year of women. I mean, women can say that. Bill Maher would say, is she still talking?'
She then poked fun of presidential candidate Ron DeSantis while praising the Barbie movie: 'Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie worked tirelessly to bring their vision of Barbie to the big screen. And has anyone ever looked better and more powerful in high heels than Margo Robbie? I mean, besides Ron DeSantis.'
Handler credited Gerwig for becoming 'the highest-grossing female director of all time, pulling in over $1.4 billion at the box office' for Barbie, and 'saving the entire movie industry.'
'Which can only mean one thing Hollywood executives are currently debating whether Greta's worth taking a second chance on,' she joked.
Chelsea wrapped up her monologue by introducing Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo, as she joked that they had names she would 'love to see John Travolta try to say' after he infamously mispronounced Idina Menzel's name at the 2014 Oscars.
Chelsea inspired a positive social media reaction from fans, with one writing: 'Chelsea Handler has done the monologue that Jo Koy should have done at the Golden Globes.'
