Joe Jonas was spotted with model Stormi Bree at a private airport in Cabo San Lucas this week, sparking rumors that the two are an item. “Joe is enjoying spending time with Stormi,” a source told Us Weekly. “His main priority and focus will always be his children, but at the same time, he’s putting himself out there and is open to what’s to come. Things are still very new, but he’s happy and he’s open to seeing where things go.” Jonas was in Mexico to perform with his brothers at a private party on New Year’s Eve. The outing comes amid his divorce with Sophie Turner, who confirmed their split last September. She’s also been spotted recently with her rumored new boyfriend, Peregrine Pearson.
