A classic rags to riches fairy tale cast its magic over audiences at Christmas and has proven to be a Walsall venue's best-selling pantomime yet.
Cinderella was staged at Walsall Arena & Arts Centre in Leamore and was the only professional pantomime production in the borough.
It also featured up-and-coming talent from students through a partnership with Walsall College.
The venue said the 2024 production will be announced very soon.
Councillor Gary Flint, Walsall Council's portfolio holder for wellbeing, leisure and public spaces, said: “It just isn’t Christmas without a trip to a pantomime, and we are delighted that Cinderella was such a success.
"Many families are making it a tradition to attend the arena’s production, returning year after year.
"The cast and Walsall Arena team have been blown away by the wonderful heart-felt comments from audiences. I would like to thank everyone who attended, as well as those who were involved in the show, including the production team, Walsall Arena staff, cast and crew.
“Walsall Arena have a fantastic year-round programme with live music across genres, comedy, theatre and more. It has something for everyone, so support your local venues and talent in 2024.”
