According to Wikipedia, Deepfakes are “synthetic media that have been digitally manipulated to replace one person’s likeness convincingly with that of another.” In a way, deepfakes have been around for a while, mainly in Hollywood.

What used to be “photoshopped” with a picture back in the day, can now be moving video, and it can be pretty convincing. So much so that laws are cracking down on the process.
Washington will have a new law that will criminalize sharing deepfakes of pornography. There was already a law in the books for creating these images, but taking effect on June 6th, knowingly sharing fake sexual images or video of people will be a gross misdemeanor. If the image is of a minor the charge could be a felony, as well as repeat offenders.
