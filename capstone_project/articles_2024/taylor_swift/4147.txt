Recently, Post Malone shared what it was like to work with Taylor Swift on their new song, which is featured on her latest album.
Post said, “It’s once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift13 comes into this world.”
He continued, “I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey. I love you so much. Thank you, Tay.”
Swift continued, “When I was writing the ‘Fortnight’ music video, I wanted to show you the worlds I saw in my head that served as the backdrop for making this music. Pretty much everything in it is a metaphor or a reference to one corner of the album or another. For me, this video turned out to be the perfect visual representation of this record and the stories I tell in it.”
She added, “@postmalone blew me away on set as our tortured tragic hero and I’m so grateful to him for everything he put into this collaboration.
