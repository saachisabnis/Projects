Taylor Swift gave a Kansas City Chiefs fan her scarf at the game versus the Miami Dolphins on Saturday.
Beth Vancil remembers Saturday’s frigid Chiefs-Dolphins game all too well.
Taylor Swift, 34, was seated directly behind her. The pop star left her scarf there in Vancil’s hands — and the lucky Kansas City Chiefs fan has still got it in her house, even now. 
“The scarf smelled like home,” Vancil told PEOPLE on Monday, just before taking photos of her 4-year-old daughter wearing it.
While interacting with fans from her Arrowhead Stadium box seat window, Swift noticed how cold some people in the crowd were amid the below-zero degree temperatures at one of the coldest games in NFL history.  
That’s when the 12-time Grammy winner, who is dating Chiefs player Travis Kelce, gifted the St. Louis resident the — not red — scarf. 
What a great story!
