In order to ensure you stay on top of the latest changes and have an action plan for compliance, here is a quick review of some critical developments we tracked in 2023 and a checklist of the essential items you should consider addressing in January and beyond.

Account for wage and hour changes. Speaking of state law changes, 22 states — including New York, New Jersey, and California — raised their minimum wage rates for the new year. Additionally, minimum wage changes in certain states, such as California, trigger updates to the salary threshold for exempt employees. You should also review local wage and hour laws, as well as any industry-specific mandates that might be coming down the pike.

Review new workplace laws in California. Many laws finalized by the California Legislature in 2023 took effect on January 1. So, if you have employees located in the Golden State, you should be prepared to comply with new workplace requirements. You can review the top 10 new laws we were tracking here (some of which took effect on January 1), as well as our Insights on paid sick leave changes and mandatory notice requirements, changes to COVID-19 notification rules, new cannabis laws, and new rules for noncompete agreements.

Be sure your EEO-1 report is filed by January 9. Although EEO-1 reports were due on December 5, employers that have not submitted and certified their data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) still have a chance to comply. Covered employers must submit and certify their reports as soon as possible, and no later than January 9, which the EEOC has stated is the “Failure to File” deadline. Here’s what you should you do if you have not yet filed.
_____
Plan for changes to the H-1B process. Starting January 29, H-1B visa holders will be allowed to renew their expiring or about-to-expire visas without leaving the U.S. This significant development will provide welcome relief to many foreign nationals and could play a key strategic role in your workforce planning in the new year and beyond. Follow these four key steps to get the most out of the new program.
