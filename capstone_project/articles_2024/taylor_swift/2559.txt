The Atlanta Falcons were one of several teams picking in the first half of the first round of the 2024 NFL draft that was widely anticipated to be part of the premium quarterback sweepstakes. One swift move in free agency seemingly pulled all the Falcons' tickets out of the quarterback draft hopper.
The Falcons are set to sign longtime Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins to a monster deal in free agency. When the league year changes on Wednesday, Cousins is expected to join the Falcons on a shiny new four-year contract worth a meaty $180 million.
That sort of financial commitment effectively removes the Falcons from considering a first-round quarterback. Atlanta holds the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft. Adding Cousins to a QB room that already includes Desmond Ridder and Taylor Heinicke (at least temporarily) should close the door on Atlanta GM Terry Fontenot and new head coach Raheem Morris from committing boffo resources to the position.
As for the Minnesota Vikings, Cousins' old team, it's one less team in their way to drafting their (hopeful) long-term replacement for Cousins. Minnesota currently has the No. 11 overall pick and a quarterback room of Jaren Hall and Nick Mullens.
