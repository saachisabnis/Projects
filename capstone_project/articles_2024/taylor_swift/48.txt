Chiefs linebacker Willie Gay Jr. served up two big hits during Sunday’s 25-17 victory over the Bengals at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
The first came in the third quarter when the Chiefs trailed by four points. Cincinnati went for it on fourth-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 6-yard line, but Gay blew up the play and tackled running back Joe Mixon for a 3-yard loss.
A second instance came later in the game and it was a different kind of hit. This was the musical kind. A video from the Chiefs showed Gay ask a cameraman to get word that he wanted to hear the song, “Swag Surfin’” by F.L.Y. played at Arrowhead.
That request was granted, and it started a dance party on the Chiefs sideline.
X user Joey shared a video from the Arrowhead Stadium stands that showed more of the Chiefs players cutting loose on the sideline.
This wouldn’t be a Chiefs dance party if tight end Travis Kelce wasn’t involved, so you know he was moving to the music. Kelce’s girlfriend, singer Taylor Swift, spotted him and she too began to dance while in a suite at Arrowhead Stadium.
