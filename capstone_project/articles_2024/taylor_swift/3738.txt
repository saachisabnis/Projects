Taylor Swift fans hoping to catch the star when she appears for a series of concerts in Scotland this summer have been left facing hefty bills as rooms in Edinburgh are going for more than £600 a night.
Close to 200,000 people are expected to watch the American singer across three nights when she brings her Eras tour to Murrayfield stadium starting on June 7.
The tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale last July and businesses across the city are already preparing for a bumper few days of trading. Many hotels are already fully booked with several hostels, B&Bs and other rental homes also putting up the virtual “no vacancies” signs.
