The winner of the Grammy's Album of the Year award was once again a controversial one.
On Sunday (February 24), SZA fans took to social media to share their frustration after the SOS artist wasn't awarded Album of the Year at the 2024 Grammys. 
Taylor Swift's Midnights nabbed the night's most coveted award over SZA, Jon Batiste, boygenius, Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, Janelle Monáe, and Olivia Rodrigo. Swift set a new record for the most Album of the Year wins in Grammy history after taking home her fourth trophy in the category. 
Earlier in the night, SZA won Grammys for Best Urban Contemporary Album, Best R&B Song ("Snooze"), and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance ("Ghost in the Machine"). 
However, social media users said SZA's SOS was robbed of Album Of The Year after it topped the charts for 10 weeks, which was longer than any of this year's nominees. Fans also pointed out how a Black woman hasn't won the category since 1999 when Lauryn Hill took home the award for her album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
Jay-Z even shaded the Recording Academy for snubbing his wife Beyoncè and other Black artists of the award in previous years during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. 
"Another year and another Black woman robbed. I feel so bad for SZA. I feel so bad for Beyoncè. I feel bad every Black woman who has to go above and beyond to put out beautiful art to be overshadowed by mediocre talent. Taylor has had AOTY 4 times?" one social media user tweeted. 
"They had a chance to break the 25-year AOTY drought since Lauryn Hill, and Sza’s SOS truly was worthy. But if Bey couldn’t do it with Lemonade, it’s hard to see others triumphing," another user said.
