Swift and Anderson Berard have been tight since high school, meeting during English class on the first day of freshman year.
“We were the ones in the back of the class saying negative things about Romeo and Juliet because we were so bitter toward that emotion at the time,” Anderson Berard recalled during a 2008 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “We just really connected and ever since then we have been inseparable.”
Swift later included the moment in her 2008 song “Fifteen,” penned about the origins of their friendship.
“You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail / And soon enough you’re best friends / Laughing at the other girls / Who think they’re so cool,” Swift sings in the song, which was rerecorded on 2021’s Fearless (Taylor’s Version). “We’ll be out of here as soon as we can/ And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind / And we both cried.”
Through the years, Swift and Anderson Berard’s friendship has endured through career accomplishments, breakups and new romances. Anderson Berard has often gushed over their bond and Swift’s musical talents via her social media pages.
