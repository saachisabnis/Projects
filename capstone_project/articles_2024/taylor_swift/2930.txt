With his brother now officially retired and his likely on the horizon, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is beginning to look towards his future. And according to the future Hall of Famer, that future includes children.
During the latest episode of the New Heights podcast that Travis hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, the former longtime center of the Philadelphia Eagles, Taylor Swift’s boyfriend made a comment about making babies that sent Jason into immediate crisis-management mode.
“You can’t tell me that dude wasn’t made in a f—— lab over there in France,” Kelce said of San Antonio Spurs rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama. “Lab-grown diamonds? That’s (a) lab-grown f—— NBA player.”
“[Lab-grown] Humans? Listen, it’s not far off, let’s be honest,” Jason replied.
“Can’t wait ‘til I f—— make one,” Kelce then said, seemingly talking about ‘making’ a human of his own.
“Don’t do this. Do not give any of these other conspiracy theorists anything else to latch onto, please,” the elder Jason, who recently announced his retirement from the NFL, replied.

Unfortunately for Jason, what he was looking to avoid is exactly what came to be, as Swifties jumped all over Kelce’s comments and have already begun conspiring.

Given that Swift has been open about her religious roots in the past, it’s likely that she and Kelce would get married before having a baby, if for no other reason than the optics.
Swift will be turning 35 years old in December, which, if you have a girlfriend, fiance, or wife, you likely know that’s the age they consider to be at the edge of their “biological clock”. She’s also in the midst of a historically successful international tour that’s currently set to run through December.
In addition to a family, Travis Kelce’s post-NFL career will likely feature a heavy dose of podcasting, as New Heights has become one of the most popular podcasts in the country, leading to the Brothers Kelce now embarking on live shows (the first of which will be at the University of Cincinnati’s Nippert Stadium on April 11) and fueling speculation that they could be the next podcasters to get a Joe Rogan-esque $100 million deal.
