Jessica Biel is in her "mob boss" era now that she has celebrated her 42nd birthday. On Monday (March 4), the Candy star shared some photos of herself on Instagram. While wearing a grey hooded robe, tons of jewelry, sunglasses, and a bold red lip, Biel captioned the pics: "Mob Boss Morning." Loving Biel's "mob morning" look, one fan complimented her look, saying, "It’s giving Audrey Hepburn meets mob [fire emoji]." Another fan said, "Loving this version of the Mafia Chief lol." One fan hilarious questioned her, "why you keep calling yourself a mob boss lol [red heart emoijs] kinda kool."

The 7th Heaven alum's post comes after she celebrated turning 42 on Sunday by sharing some sexy photos, again calling herself a "mob boss." Among the carousel of pics, the mother of two wore a similar lip color, with different sunglasses, wearing a miniskirt, furry jacket, black tights, and heeled boots. Posing with her leg kicked up on a couch, the star's sultry photo is joined with another image of her in the corner of a room with her legs crossed in front of a lemon-patterned wallpaper. She captioned this carousel of birthday photos: "Not a mob wife, a mob BOSS. [lipstick kiss emoji]."

One person hilariously commented on the post: "Not a mob anything? Youre married to a pop star?" A fan of her caption commented, "The Godmother! Leave the guns, grab the cannolis!" Another fan quoted Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets and wrote: "As you command boss. As head Mook I serve the family."
Of course, her husband of twelve years, Justin Timberlake, 43, paid tribute to his wife on her birthday. The "Señorita" singer posted a sweet compilation video of Biel's best moments set to Tina Turner’s song “The Best.” He captioned the clip: “There ain’t no other way to say it. You’re the best. I love you. Happy birthday, ya [goat emoji]!” The couple shares sons Silas, 8, and Phineas, 3. Though they typically keep their boys out of the limelight, they were featured in a few adorable clips in the post.
