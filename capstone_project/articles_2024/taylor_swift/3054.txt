Taylor Swift is on a break from the international leg of her Eras Tour until she heads back to Paris in early May, which means you just never know where you’ll find her. And right now, she may or may not be in…Cleveland? That’s where boyfriend Travis Kelce is, at least.
Kelce, a loud and proud native son of Ohio, was spotted Saturday at Pizzeria Geraci’s Slice Shop in Cleveland, with the pizza joint sharing a snap of a sweatsuit-clad Kelce in their establishment on Instagram.

“Next time bring Taylor 😉 🏈,” the slice spot wrote in the pic’s caption.
Could Swift be, in a paraphrase of her own words, waiting at home for the guy on the Chiefs to come straight home to her, pizza in hand? It would make for an ideal Hometown Date in a Swiftian Bachelor spinoff, it can’t be denied, and while Kelce isn’t exactly inconspicuous himself, Swift tends to attract a lot of attention when she's out and about.
Whether they’re doing the post-vacation staycation thing, there’s no denying that snaps of the couple taking some time off in the Bahamas last week prove they're still going strong. 
The couple, who have been dating since last summer, were spotted in the Bahamas’ Harbour Island, enjoying many an in-ocean smooch in their downtime. After Kelce’s second consecutive Super Bowl win with the Kansas City Chiefs in February and Swift’s Eras Tour marathon, which has now marked more than a year since its first show, the two are indulging in some well-earned relaxation time.
Earlier this month, an unnamed source told Us Weekly that the two are “nesting” in Los Angeles during their mutual time off work, a contrast to the international dateline-spanning jaunts for Swift to see Kelce play in the Super Bowl (Tokyo to Las Vegas) or Kelce’s bye-week trip to see Swift perform (and leave her dad hanging for a high-five) in Buenos Aires.
“They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,” the source said. “They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed.”
While football season doesn’t kick off again for months, Swift has even more on her plate than her three-hour-plus live shows: On April 19, she’ll release her latest studio album, The Tortured Poets Department. She announced the album’s existence in the grandest possible way, dropping the title and date into an acceptance speech for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammys 2024. Later in the night, she took home a record-breaking fourth Album of the Year Grammy, making her the all-time winningest artist of the award.
Representatives for Taylor Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
