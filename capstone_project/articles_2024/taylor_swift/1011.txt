Taylor Swift is said to be "devastated" over the grotesque AI-generated images that have emerged online, with her now "in two minds about her career" and unsure of how to move forward.
The 34-year-old hitmaker is the latest victim of a deepfake porn site, which shared fake images of Taylor in NSFW situations while donning Kansas City Chiefs merchandise earlier this week. When the fake images emerged online, Taylor's fans were quick to react, with many urging the singer to take legal action.
Whether the singer will take legal action is an open question, but a source close to the singer did tell MailOnline in the week that Taylor's family and friends are "furious".

According to MailOnline, a source close to the hitmaker has said: "Whether or not legal action will be taken is being decided but there is one thing that is clear: these fake AI-generated images are abusive, offensive, exploitative, and done without Taylorâ€™s consent and/or knowledge."
Carrying out a Tarot reading for the hitmaker in the wake of the disgraceful occurrence of the fake images, celebrity psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman has exclusively told The Mirror that she is "truly devastated" and "isn't sure how to move forward".
"When tuning into Taylor Swift's feelings around the disgraceful AI-generated images circulating at the moment, a single card comes out. It is the three of Swords, a tarot card of heartbreak and hard choices," Inbaal revealed to us.
Describing the card, Inbaal noted how a red heart is visible, with it pierced by three sharp swords, "meaning Taylor is truly devastated by the news that anyone would take the time and effort to create something so grotesque and demeaning". Inbaal added: "She believes that this person, and anyone who laughed at the images, must really hate her."
She then went on to reveal: "The three of Swords is a card that predicts a fork in the road, where both options are bad, and it means that Taylor is thinking that giving up her career would be an awful choice, but staying in a career that can result in this happening, is just as bad.
"The card says that she's in two minds about her entire career and way of life, and isn't sure how to move forward at all," Inbaal concluded.
