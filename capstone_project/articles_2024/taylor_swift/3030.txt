Everything sources, insiders, and Travis himself (!) has said about getting engaged. 💍
Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been dating for nearly two years (I’m rounding up, leave me alone!) and naturally some fans want to know when Travis is gonna pull out a ring and pop the question. 
The answer? No one’s business, to be quite honest, but that hasn’t stopped everyone from talking about it. And when I say everyone, I mean sources, insiders, friends, and even Travis himself. Multiple times! 
Due to being truly committed to the Taylor Swift + Travis Kelce discourse and wanting to procrastinate on the rest of our responsibilities, we’ve rounded up literally everything everyone’s said about a possible engagement. Enjoy!
December 2023: Page Six spoke to a “source close to Kelce” who claimed Trav asked Scott Swift for his permission to propose to Taylor. Ahem: “Scott has been asked for his blessing and has wholeheartedly given it, and Travis has been talking to friends about a ring.”
January 2024: Page Six reported “there’s buzz around Swift’s camp” that Travis and Taylor will get engaged in the summer, and Travis only didn’t propose on Valentine’s Day because “they don’t want it to seem like it’s rushed insanity.” Their source added, “Taylor and Travis discussed it and there is a plan. They will get engaged on their one-year anniversary in July.”
May 2024:  An insider told Entertainment Tonight on May 17, “Taylor and Travis are doing amazing, and their loved ones see an engagement coming sooner than later. They make a great match and there’s no question about that.”
But then just a few days later on May 21, a source told Us Weekly, “Travis has no plans on proposing to Taylor anytime soon. It’s not even on his radar. Marriage is something he takes very seriously and not something he would ever just jump into without giving it some careful consideration.”
August 2024:  Page Six circled back with another source who said, “The engagement is happening soon,” although Travis’s rep “denied” that there were official plans in place. On top of that, the outlet reported that they’d heard the “wife of a top Chiefs exec” was “telling pals in a suite” that Travis and Taylor are already engaged.  
September 2024: Us Weekly speaks to someone who says, “They both see marriage as something they want sooner rather than later, and they both want kids. Taylor has always [been excited by] the idea of marriage and starting a family. She just hadn’t found The One until now.” 
Meanwhile, ESPN pundit Adam Schefter vaguely implies on air that the couple is engaged:
September 4, 2024: Us Weekly speaks to a source who says “friends hope an engagement is a sure thing in the future.”
October 26, 2024: Page Six says a source has told them there’s “a countdown to an engagement for the starry pair.”
December 3, 2024: Us Weekly speaks to two more sources, one of whom says Tay and Trav would "love to be engaged" but "aren't rushing it," and another who says “Taylor does feel like Travis is The One, but jumping in is not her style. That’s just not how she does [things]. Marriage is a big deal, and she wants [it to be] forever.”
February 18, 2025: Us Weekly is back with more sources, one who says “Those close to them actually think [Travis may do it] while they’re on vacation," and another who adds "they are both on the same page about taking the next step."
Travis’s mom, Donna Kelce, was asked about a potential engagement by CNN and said, “It’s totally up to them, them being happy, we don’t know anything for right now. I’m sure he would call me up and tell me, and I haven’t heard anything yet. That’s all you want for your children is happiness, nothing else matters.” Just a mom momming!
Meanwhile, Travis’s Chiefs teammate Harrison Butker straight-up said, “I hope they get married and start a family.”
Finally a sentiment from him I can relate to. 
Oh, and let’s not forget Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman claimed, “Someone actually reached out to me today and said they might actually be engaged so I might have broke the story.”
First, there was the time he was minding his own business at a Super Bowl press conference and a reporter (some might say boldly) asked him, “Is there going to be another ring besides the Super Bowl ring if you win this thing on Sunday?” Travis’s response? “I’m focused on getting this ring, and that’s all that my mind’s focused on right now.”
Then Travis was chatting about NBA player Victor Wembanyama on his podcast New Heights, and after saying, “You can’t tell me that dude wasn’t made in a fucking lab over there in France. Lab-grown diamonds, that’s a lab-grown fucking NBA player,” he said—slightly under his breath—“Can’t wait till I fuckin’ make one.” 
Note: Travis’s brother Jason responded with: “Don’t do this. Do not give any of these other conspiracy theorists anything else to latch onto, please.”
And most recently (we’re talking June 2024), Travis was asked by Jason Sudeikis when he’s “gonna make an honest woman” out of Taylor and simply smiled his way through the question.
This has been an update!
Tay's bestie and producer said that the track was "written and recorded at home." 👀
“He will still not respond because he has removed himself from her narrative and is very glad he did.”
Anonymous sources, tortured man clubs, cheating rumors—it's all just a lot.
