How much should you spend on your sweetheart for your first Valentine's Day? Would you say $16,000 is a little excessive? Because that's what Travis Kelce laid out for Taylor Swift.
A source says, "He wanted to show her how much he cares about her and the upcoming months to come as they will travel together all over the world."
Travis arrived in Sydney yesterday via private jet, of course, to join Taylor on tour.
