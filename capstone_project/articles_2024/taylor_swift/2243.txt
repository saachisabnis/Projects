Keds is getting sweet just in time for spring, due to a new partnership with Magnolia Bakery.
The prolific footwear brand has announced today its latest collaborator. The two companies worked together for the first time on a limited-edition, three-style capsule. The styles feature confetti sprinkles and other cake decorations.
“We’re so excited to give fans of both brands an all-new way to celebrate their love of Magnolia Bakery with Keds classic silhouettes,” Sara Gramling, VP of PR and partnerships at Magnolia Bakery said in a release. “The Magnolia Bakery brand is layered with so many flavors and joyful colorways, and we’ve made a real effort in recent years to find creative ways to share those experiences with our fans from coast to coast.”

The offerings include three classic silhouettes: the Keds Champion now comes with multi-colored glitter on the sneaker’s uppers; the Triple Decker, which features a 1-inch platform, is a slip-on with a daisy-embroidered pink upper; and the Triple Up, featuring a 1.5-inch platform, is a white lace-up with mint green detailing and sprinkles on the footbed. The capsule also comes replete with small accessories like a “Carrie cupcake” charm for the Champion and the Triple Up.

This is the latest in Keds’ long line of collaborations. Since 2009, Keds has worked with names like Kate Spade, Major League Baseball, and Madewell. In 2012, the label even worked with Taylor Swift in celebration of her “1989 World Tour.”
Magnolia Bakery is a New York City staple that has expanded internationally. The company became synonymous with “Sex and the City,” for which they named their “Carrie” cupcake.
The three sneaker styles from the Keds X Magnolia Bakery collaboration will be released on March 21. Each style is priced at $80. They will be available on http://www.keds.com and with select retailers.
