Taylor Swift said she didn’t “really like” hiding her relationship with ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn.
The Grammy-winner, 34, who has been putting on very public displays of affection with her new love Travis Kelce, also 34, since they started dating last year, but stayed out of the spotlight when she was seeing British actor Joe, 33, from 2016 to 2023.
She said in an interview that resurfaced on Wednesday (April 17) and has since gone viral: “It all depends on who you’re with. If they have a serious issue with it, then you, I guess, hide or whatever. But I don’t really like that.
“It makes me feel like I’m running from the law or something. I don’t want to feel like I’m like a fugitive. Like, ‘Oh, my God, we’re having a relationship. Better put on a mask and stuff.’”
Taylor added her dream romance would be “normal," saying: “That would be good. I’d just rather live my life.”
She and Joe were often seen shielding their faces from fans and photographers when they were out in public.
In contrast, she regularly kisses Travis, and rushed the field earlier this year when his team won the Super Bowl to smooch the athlete.
The resurfaced video clip also included footage of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis talking about how they deal with paparazzi.
He added: “It comes with [Taylor’s fame]. You’ve got a lot of people that care about Taylor and for good reason.”
Taylor and Travis first sparked romance rumors in September 2023, five months after news broke she had split from Joe.
And in the last month alone, the couple have put on PDAs on holiday in the Bahamas and at the Coachella music festival.
Fans have been revisiting her and Joe’s relationship ahead of the release of her latest album The Tortured Poets Department on Friday (April 19), as they are convinced it will contain references to the failed romance.
The album’s fifth track "So Long, London" is thought to be a reference to Taylor’s time in her ex’s home country.
