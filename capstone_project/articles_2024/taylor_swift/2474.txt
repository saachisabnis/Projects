A former aide to disgraced ex-Rep George Santos said his planned political comeback is a  “joke” —  that should nevertheless be taken seriously. 
Santos, who was expelled from the House in December after being indicted for fraud and other felonies announced this week that he would launch a primary challenge against Suffolk County Rep. Nick LaLota.
Naysa Woomer, a one-time communications manager for Santos, was asked Friday on CNN  whether she thought there was something wrong with her former boss for wanting to return to the Beltway. 
“I want to say yes, a little bit, because it sounds like someone who just, he went from being a congressman to a celebrity,” Woomer said. “And I think, just the media attention that came around him during his entire time in Congress, it just, I think it increased his ego…I mean, it’s a joke.”
“And one of my biggest questions is, you know, do we need to go back?” she added.
Woomer, who called Santos’ attempted reentry into a politics a “Taylor Swift revenge tour” —  said LaLota should still be on guard against any surprises in the June primary.
“I would take this very seriously because once again, we could see something slip through the cracks,” said Woomer, referencing former GOP House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s surprise 2014 defeat in Virginia to David Bratt, a political novice.
LaLota — one of Santos’ most vociferous critics during his brief congressional career and among a clutch of Empire State Republicans to lead the charge to expel him from Congress —  appeared unbothered by the challenge.
“Long Islanders are plenty familiar with George Santos’ BS. To raise the standard in Congress, and to hold a pathological liar who stole an election accountable, I led the charge to expel George Santos. If finishing the job requires beating him in a primary, count me in,” LaLota told The Post.
Santos did not return a request for comment.
