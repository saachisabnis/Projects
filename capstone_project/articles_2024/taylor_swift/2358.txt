(TMX) - Taylor Swift has referenced the 19th-century American poet Emily Dickinson multiple times, and now genealogy company Ancestry has revealed they are related.
Ancestry told TODAY on Monday that the “Cruel Summer” singer, 34, and Dickinson are sixth cousins, three times removed.
“Swift and Dickinson both descend from a 17th-century English immigrant,” Ancestry revealed to TODAY.
Swift’s 9th great-grandfather and Dickinson’s 6th great-grandfather was an early settler of Windsor, Connecticut, according to Ancestry.
“Taylor Swift’s ancestors remained in Connecticut for six generations until her part of the family eventually settled in northwestern Pennsylvania, where they married into the Swift family line.”
Back in 2022, while accepting the Songwriter-Artist of the Decade honor at the Nashville Songwriter Awards, Swift revealed her lyrics fall into three categories — Fountain Pen, Quill Pen or Glitter Gel Pen — “based on what writing tool I imagine having in my hand when I scribbled it down.”
“If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre,” she said. “I don’t actually have a quill anymore. I broke it once when I was mad.”
Swift’s upcoming album “The Tortured Poets Department” drops on April 19.
