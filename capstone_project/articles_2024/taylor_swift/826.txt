Newly minted billionaire Taylor Swift has collected an impressive real estate portfolio.
One of her properties, a townhouse in NYC, was the recent target of an attempted break-in.
Take a look at the properties she currently owns in Nashville, California, and more.
Taylor Swift will never be out of style — or at least out of homes.
The superstar has built up a real estate portfolio that is worth at least $100 million, according to property records seen by Business Insider. She's used trusts and limited liability companies (LLCs) to buy homes throughout the US.
Swift reached billionaire status last year, and her record-breaking Eras Tour is a big factor in her fortune.
Some of her most recognizable abodes are her multiple apartments in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City and the sprawling Rhode Island mansion where the star hosts her famous friends for summer parties.
Check out some of the homes where T-Swift might've written or recorded her new album, "The Tortured Poets Department."
In 2009 at age 19, Swift made her first major purchase: a 4,000-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouse in The Adelicia in Nashville, Tennessee for $1.99 million.
Not only is The Adelicia close to Nashville's Music Row, but it also has a private garage, heated pool, and fitness center, according to the building's website.
As of 2021, the appraised value of the apartment is over $3.7 million, according to public property records viewed by BI.
Swift told Vulture that she designed the penthouse herself. When she spoke to the publication in 2013, she had a photo on display of Kanye West interrupting her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Under the photo she reportedly wrote, "Life is full of little interruptions."
Swift reportedly bought the Northumberland Estate in Forest Hills, Tennessee in 2011 for $2.5 million.
The estate has an appraised property value of about $3.7 million as of 2021. Although multiple outlets — including The Wall Street Journal — have reported that Swift owns the mansion, BI was unable to confirm her ownership via property records in 2024. (We've reached out to her representatives in an attempt to clarify if she still owns the property.)
The Northumberland Estate is a Greek Revival-style home that was built around 1934. It formerly belonged to Guilford Dudley Jr., who served as the US ambassador to Denmark, WSJ reported.
Swift bought an 11,000-square-foot colonial-style mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island for $17.75 million in 2013.
The home, formerly known as Holiday House, was built in 1904. Swift wrote "the last great american dynasty" on her "folklore" album about the home's former owner, Rebekah Harkness.
She reportedly paid for the home in cash.
"I got the house when I was in my early twenties as a place for my family to congregate and be together," Swift told Entertainment Weekly, saying that she learned about Harkness "as soon as I was being walked through [her former Rhode Island] home."
Swift is known for throwing Fourth of July parties at the house, which is at the highest point of Watch Hill and has views of Little Narragansett Bay. The mansion has eight bedrooms, eight fireplaces, and a pool.
It now has an assessed value of $20,434,100, according to property records.

Swift bought the Beverly Hills mansion known as the Goldwyn Estate in 2015 for $25 million.
The property now has an assessed value of just under $30 million, according to property records.
Swift reportedly bought the estate through an LLC from the Goldwyn family. It belonged to the legendary Hollywood producer who was part of the iconic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, and reportedly hosted old Hollywood stars such as Clark Gable and Bette Davis.
The mansion has six bedrooms, a tennis court, a whole apartment for guests, and a swimming pool.
In 2017, the home was granted historic landmark status, WSJ reported.
Swift welcomed herself to New York by buying two penthouse units in Tribeca's Sugar Loaf building in 2014 for $19.95 million.
She had the penthouses converted into an 8,309-square-foot duplex, which now has 10 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms.
Swift bought the penthouses from "The Lord of the Rings" director Peter Jackson through an LLC.
Three years later in 2017, she bought the townhouse next door for $18 million, and in 2018, she purchased yet another apartment in the Sugar Loaf building for $9.75 million. All four of her reported NYC apartments can be linked by LLCs that share the same tax addresses on property records.
Andrew Azoulay, a real-estate agent in Manhattan, told The Wall Street Journal that he advised Swift to buy the townhouse to act as a private garage and to buy the second-floor apartment to connect the garage to her duplex in the Sugar Loaf building.
Her townhouse has been the target of break-in attempts over the years. In January, a man was arrested for trying to gain access to the building while Swift was attending the Kansas City Chiefs game versus the Bills in Buffalo.
