“This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try then how will we know it can’t be done? And if we do not try, it most certainly won’t be done. The Founders’ Republic, and the larger war for western civilization, will be lost.”
“But I tell you this: We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.”

What’s Behind The GOP/GOP, Inc. Curtain?

Desantis has the audacity to say President Trump is the “embodiment’s of the DC Republican Class“…. Such a damn meatball, a lot of filler and not a lot of meat.
“DeSantis on Rubio Trump Endorsement: D.C. GOPers Who Don’t Do Anything Like Trump, Not a Reformer Like Me”
On Monday’s broadcast of “NewsNation Live,” 2024 Republican presidential candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis reacted to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) endorsing rival 2024 candidate former President Donald Trump by stating that D.C. Republicans “talk a big game, but they don’t ever deliver” on things like the border and spending. And Trump has “become kind of the embodiment of the D.C. Republican class and that’s who they support. I’m a change agent. We’re going to upset the apple cart in D.C. A lot of those politicians aren’t going to be happy with some of the things we do” like term limits and banning members from owning stocks.
But honestly, I don’t think our voters want to see somebody that is being supported by all these Washington politicians. I think they look at Washington, D.C., and they say, these Republicans talk a big game, but they don’t ever deliver. It’s

Mariana Mazzucato , a speaker at the WEF Forum, states that they failed with vaccinating the world. Climate Change is just not a concept most people understand. 
Hmmmm. New Plan:
Everyone understands water. Even a child knows that you need water. 
So, are these morally corrupt demons attacking water next?  Shutting off the faucet? Poisoning the water supply?And why do they announce each stage of their diabolic, antihuman agenda?
You have no mineral rights on your land. You are not entitled to a puddle of water on your land  The Amish may not grow food and sell it to their neighbors. Our cars and appliances spy on us (or at least have the capability).  Property taxes are beginning to skyrocket.
Travel by air is advertised as being dangerous. “Look our new hires are brain dead, unskilled, and basically incompetent.  Oh, and the doors are falling off mid-flight!”
Enemy combatants please do march right in with your free phones, credit cards, lodging, and no ID necessary. Now, vote dammit!
The New World Order Scum have declared war on humanity. They are the enemy. Take money from them–you are the enemy, too. Hear me Nikki?  Hear me Hollywood? Hear me Congress?
“So, are these morally corrupt demons attacking water next?”
Poisoning the water currently.
‘Watch the Water’ and ‘Watch the Water II’ tell you how they are already poisoning the water supply.

They are ALREADY using billions of gallons of water a year for their AI computation centers.  Microsoft alone uses 6.8 billion gallons a year for their AI work – then there is Gulag, Amazon, Palantir, and many others. NVidia forecasts show the AI industry is in its infancy, but set to go through a rapid growth spurt. Then there are all the data centers.
How desperately close we actually came to WW3, while WW2 was still going on!
These articles are disastrously but entirely historically accurate, and they just might be the real reason why Churchill lost his job:

The documents which now confirm this have been declassified. By the responsible country’s own national archives.
However: a very careful reading of (especially) the second document might reveal just how much “Europeans and especially Eastern Europeans think about – obsess about” – TERRITORY.
I “very matter-of-factly” encourage you to soberly consider “our country’s” international activities using this exact “historical context.” Right Now.
PATTON and MacArthur  WERE CORRECT to BE AGGRESSIVE / DEFENSIVE .
Truman’s INHERITED  COMMUNISTS were The Problem.

What they are truly scared of is losing their grip on narrative control and censorship, along with the resulting flow of truth to the masses.  Her fake fear porn act about the letter ‘X’ is intended to hype their “Virus X” fear campaign.

This is unbelievable. 
Remember- I was sued civilly by 8 Capitol police officers who claimed I was responsible for civil rights violations against them, and their assault and battery. 
They tried to extort $120,000 from me to make it go away. 
I refused, and we proved that… https://t.co/BMPYymrmF8

For the Nevada voters, this article from the Reno CBS channel explains the two different vote options, the primary and the caucus but even better, it has links for finding the caucus locations for every county (the Nevada GOP . org link), or just the Washoe (Reno area) locations; plus a link to the Secretary of State office on the elections if there are any questions:
