BUFFALO'S #1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
With warm weather expected throughout the weekend, you have to get out and enjoy it! Throughout the weekend, we’re supposed to have temperatures in the 50s, how nice! 
Thankfully, there are so many events this weekend to make the most of Mother Nature’s gift in Western New York, and if you have Irish pride, refer to yourself as a Swiftie, or you like to exercise, there is something for YOU this weekend! 
Honestly, there is something for everyone in Western New York. The fun is limitless!
For the first weekend of March, there are a lot of events planned in Western New York that will help you have fun during this first taste of spring. While tons of people are planning to be out and about this weekend, there are events happening indoors too!
If you can’t decide on what to do, don’t worry; like every week, we have narrowed down the top events for this weekend.
Every Friday, Kadie's Kalendar takes a closer look at some of the best events going on around Western New York for that weekend, and there are so many things to do, it can be overwhelming!
It’s a great weekend for hockey, movie nights, basketball, zumba, dancing, and more! All of these fun events are happening this weekend (and more!) in Western New York.

There is so much to choose from on the list, I completely get it, but at the top of my weekend wish list is the Taylor Swift / Morgan Wallen party at Buffalo Ironworks, followed by Zumbathon at the Independent Health Family YMCA!
