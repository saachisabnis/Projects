Watch the incident unfold in the video below.
The concert chaos comes on the heels of news that Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign saw seven figures in revenue from Vultures 1 in just its first week.
In a breakdown by Billboard on Wednesday (February 21), it was revealed that Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s album, independently released via Label Engine, likely earned them a significant share of revenue, around 95%.

Vultures 1 amassed 169 million on-demand streams during its debut week, translating to roughly $892,000, supplemented by approximately $145,000 from sales. Considering global streams and publishing, the magazine estimates the collaborators have easily crossed the million-dollar mark.
What’s more impressive is that the album didn’t even have a full week to do these numbers, as it arrived on a Saturday instead of the traditional Friday. In addition, it was met with multiple hiccups on streaming services because of a discrepancy with its initial distributor, FUGA.

The album was temporarily removed from streaming services five days after its release due to a complaint from FUGA.

“On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement,” the company said. “Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”
The album was quickly reinstated on streaming platforms after Kanye and Ty  found another distributor, Label Engine, who had previously released the singles “Vultures” and “Talking/Once Again.”
