WASHINGTON (TND) â€” Fans of a certain worldwide pop superstar will likely have their headphones on and social media at the ready just after midnight on Friday.
Taylor Swift will release her 11th studio album, "The Tortured Poets Department," on Friday after months of anticipation following a surprise on-stage announcement at the Grammys in February.
The production and sound of the album has remained a mystery leading up to the release, but Swift found a way to let fans have a taste of what's to come throughout this week.
The artist released various lyric snippets through a pop-up library in partnership with Spotify at The Grove in Los Angeles, California, as well as through clues on Apple Music's platform and QR codes popping up in cities all over the world like Chicago, New York City and Paris.
On Thursday, Swift announced the lead single off the album, a track called "Fortnight" with singer/songwriter Post Malone.
Previously, Swift used her top-selling "The Eras Tour" as an avenue to share vinyl record variants of "Tortured Poets," based on the album's bonus tracks: "The Manuscript," "The Bolter," "The Albatross" and "The Black Dog."
Swift's team also announced a "Board Meeting Agenda" for listeners of the new album Thursday, telling listeners to bring along their "listening device, department-issued uniform, talismans, charms + snacks and dictionary."
With hours to go until the official release, Swift is also already breaking music records.
Spotify announced Thursday that "The Tortured Poets Department" became the most pre-saved album Countdown Page in Spotify history.
