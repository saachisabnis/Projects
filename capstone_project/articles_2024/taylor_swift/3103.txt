Want to make your relationship stronger and better? Forget surprise getaways or huge romantic gestures and get ready to get goofy. Experts say the key to staying emotionally connected to your partner and keeping the bond between you strong is doing small and silly things as a couple.
These little things not only strengthen that bond, they can even help reduce the risk of divorce. And it turns out, singing in the shower together is one of them. Therapist and relationship coach Susie Masterson says it’s an excellent way to lower our stress hormone (cortisol) and increase the happy hormones (dopamine), as well as increasing connection. She explains, “Making the time to do something together — such as singing in the shower — can improve our relationship by reminding us of the intimate connection we once had.”
But if belting out some Taylor Swift songs or show tunes in the shower with your partner isn’t your thing, don’t worry, there are lots of other fun little ways to help maintain closeness and secure that bond, according to relationship experts.
“Ultimately, it’s these moments of fun and laughter that can build the foundation of a strong relationship and reduce the chance of fallouts, breakups or even divorce,” says sex and relationship expert Annabelle Knight. “Do not underestimate the power of being silly together — it may just be the secret ingredient your relationship needs to thrive.”
