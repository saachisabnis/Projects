ST. PAUL, Minn. — Camila Foligno held her father’s hand as her eyes glanced around a room full of female hockey players Saturday afternoon.
The 3-year-old wasn’t a stranger to pregame activities at Xcel Energy Center, having watched her dad, Marcus Foligno, play there many times for the Minnesota Wild. But this time, she took in the scene as the Minnesota’s Professional Women’s Hockey League team got ready to take the ice for its home opener. Camila and her older sister, Olivia, 5, just started skating, but Marcus wanted them to experience this historic event. Foligno, wearing one of the team’s purple jerseys, colorfully read the starting lineup for the players, who slapped their knees as a drumroll.

“In the pipes, we’ve got Maddie Rooney.”
“On defense, we’ve got the ‘Big Unit,’  Lee Stecklein.”
She listened as Foligno yelled other nicknames, like “Coyner” for Kendall Coyne Schofield and “The High-zee” for Taylor Heise, the former Gophers star and prized No. 1 pick. When he finished, Camila, Olivia and their dad went around the room to slap hands with each of the women. At the end, Foligno smiled and pointed to Camila.
“That,” he said, “could be the next ‘Big Unit.’”

And that was what Saturday’s record-breaking game was all about. It was more than just the dazzling hat trick by former Gopher Grace Zumwinkle in a 3-0 victory by Minnesota over Montreal. The 13,316 that set a women’s pro hockey attendance record at the Wild’s home arena featured tons of young girls hockey players all realizing that their dream could actually come true. They held signs like “Herstory” and “It’s Crazy Until You Do It.” They bumped gloves with their new idols on the way onto the ice, with a few lucky teams standing right in front of them at the blue line during the national anthems.

Most of these players, even the Olympians, have never played in front of this big a crowd, which saluted them with a standing ovation at the end. “Honestly, I’m at a loss for words,” Zumwinkle said. “That was electric,” Rooney said.
And, they hope, inspiring.
“I always struggled when a young girl came up to me and said, ‘I want to play pro hockey,’” said Coyne Schofield, Minnesota’s captain and an Olympic gold medalist. “It was hard to look her back in the eye and say, ‘You can be.’ I knew the support, the resources, the opportunity wasn’t what she needed.
“And now, I can look her back in the eye and say, ‘Yes, you can!’ It’s a dream come true.”

Leni Roberts, 7, and her teammate Charlie Uzlik were among the hundreds of youth hockey players who stood right against the glass during warmups.
They held up their sign, ‘All for One, One for All,’ and recognized some of the opponents of their Under-8 Lakeville team doing something similar.
“They already think they’ll be playing for the Gophers if you ask them,” said mother Michelle Roberts, who coaches the Under-10 girls team in Lakeville. “Guess what, now they can dream big. They’ve got an opportunity now. It’s crazy.”

Another sign, held up by a young girl on the other side of the zone, played off a Taylor Swift song, “The Man.”
“We’ve been skating just as fast as we can. Wondering if we’d get there quicker if we were a man.’’
For some of these pro players, the only role models they had growing up were men. Natalie Darwitz, the general manager of the PWHL Minnesota team, would go to Minnesota North Stars games and look up to Neal Broten. Coyne Schofield went to many Blackhawks games as a kid, with her only experience seeing women playing hockey coming when the U.S. National Team played against Canada at the United Center before the Olympics.
“I wanted to play for the Blackhawks, because that’s all I knew,” Coyne Schofield said. “There was never women’s hockey. I never saw a college (women’s) game until I went on a recruiting trip.”
With the growing success and popularity of women’s hockey on the international stage, there became momentum for a unified professional women’s hockey league in North America. Coyne Schofield became an integral engine to get the PWHL started, including being one of the players (along with Hilary Knight and Sarah Nurse) to negotiate a 40-page collective bargaining agreement that took six months to finalize.
The league’s leadership, including Stan Kasten, Billie Jean King and Ilana Kloss, put an emphasis on this being a full-fledged professional league, one with staying power. There’s a $35,000 minimum salary for players, with six players making at least $80,000 on a three-year deal. Coyne Schofield said the league is putting in extra effort, like paying for her to have a nanny for her 6-month-old son, Drew, while on the road, something that wasn’t part of the CBA.
The six-team league includes Minnesota, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Boston and New York, a group narrowed down after an initial list of 20. The first week of game action has included some record crowds, including over 8,000 in Ottawa. The entire Toronto home game slate has been sold out. The Minnesota team is the only one to play their games at an NHL arena, but Kasten said the plan going forward is for all of their teams to have that, or an NHL equivalent. While this wasn’t the largest women’s hockey crowd ever — the Canada-USA game in Seattle drew a crowd of 14,551 at Climate Pledge Arena — it was a watershed moment for the new league.

“We have delivered the proof of concept: Women’s hockey works,” Kasten said.
“We love this opportunity — we didn’t get it,” Darwitz said. “But these guys’ responsibility is they’ve got to reap what we sowed. Now they have to sow something and the next generation can reap that. It’s how it’s going to work.”
Darwitz, the former Gophers star and captain of the U.S. National team, left her coaching career (including a stint as Gophers assistant) to become the Minnesota GM. The mother of two has been on her phone more the last few months than the last five years, as her staff of 15 does the work “usually done by an army.” That means everything from player signings to setting up travel to unpacking equipment. The focus was building a team around Minnesota-born players, and there are 13 natives, including the two stars of Saturday’s home opener, Zumwinkle and Rooney.
Darwitz also hit the jackpot in landing the No. 1 pick, used on Heise, who received the largest cheers among all players Saturday. The draft, held in September, had the order decided by a computer/phone randomizer. “I was joking that I don’t even win at bingo or playing board games with my kids,” Darwitz said. “Knowing Taylor, if we didn’t get 1, 2 or 3, the likelihood of getting Taylor severely diminished. For us to be No. 1, it wasn’t a decision. It was a no-brainer.”
When Heise found out she’d be going No. 1 to her hometown state, she cried. So did her dad.
Heise, the former Red Wing High and Gophers star, didn’t start watching hockey until she was 12. Her family was big into basketball, which was her passion. The idea of hockey was started serendipitously.
“I got a random note in my backpack about it and I told my mom, ‘I might as well try it,’” Heise said. “I was playing every sport — soccer, track. Did anything but hockey. I started and had gear way too big, skates too big. I only skated eight times my first year, and my parents asked, ‘You still want to do it?’ I did. Then I got better.”

Heise now gets to play with one of the pioneers she grew up watching in Coyne Schofield. Her entire family got to watch the team’s home debut Saturday, and Heise embraced every moment to chat with the young female hockey players around the rink.
“You meet every little girl that wants to have a dream like mine, and you can say, ‘You know, that’s possible.'”
What an electric atmosphere at end. Standing ovation by the record 13,136. Yelling “MINN-E-SOTA!.” A 3-0 win by home team. pic.twitter.com/KKNQGf0xfQ

Ken Klee walked into the team’s dressing room before Saturday’s game in a black suit and a purple-striped tie.
He looked around and told all the women that it’s going to be a “crazy” day, especially with this being their first home game. The record crowd.
“This is all for you,” he told them.
Klee never expected to have this job. He interviewed in August, along with other candidates. But Darwitz picked Charlie Burggraf, who ran the team for a couple of months before unexpectedly deciding to leave right before the holidays. Darwitz said Burggraf had some things that came up personally and with his family that he felt he needed to tend to, which led to the team having no head coach a week or so before their opener.
Klee, the former NHL defenseman, had experience coaching men (assistant on the Lightning’s AHL affiliate Syracuse) and women (won two straight World Championships as coach for Team USA). But he was back in the Denver area with his wife preparing for Christmas when he got the call. He soon packed his bags, put some suits and clothes in his truck and drove 13 hours to Minnesota to start his new gig. The couple are empty nesters, with their sons out of the house.
“I asked my wife, and she said, ‘What an amazing opportunity — you’ve got to go for it,’” Klee recalled.

Klee’s wife and some of their friends were in Costa Rica on Saturday, a trip he had planned to go on. But he was happy to be where he was, leading a group of women in picking up their second straight victory to open the season. What does he appreciate the most about the women’s game?
“I was amazed at their commitment,” Klee said. “When NHL players are getting paid to play and train year around, and before when I first took over (a women’s hockey program), there was just a mini stipend for girls. I’d ask, ‘How do they eat?’ Some get jobs, some get sponsors. It’s like they train like NHLers but they weren’t getting paid. That was huge for me to say, ‘Wow, these women are incredible.’ I was blown away. They’re better pros not getting paid than a ton of pros that I played with.”
Now that the women are pros, and are getting paid, Klee reveled in what he saw Saturday afternoon in St. Paul. The lower bowl and club level packed with fans, from young girls to their moms to proud “girl dads.” He asked the team at one point if any of them had ever played in front of around 14,000 people. Most of them hadn’t.
“Now they have,” he said.
What’s the message? “Dream big,” Klee said.
Camila Foligno will be told that story many times by her dad.
“Who knows what it’s going to be like when she’s 16, 17, 18 years old,” Foligno said. “But it’s just another avenue that helps out women and gives them something to keep playing the game for. (My daughters) are always around the game with their dad. But to be around people that look like them? It’s even better.”
GO DEEPER
What would the NHL standings look like if they adopted a 3-point system for regulation wins?
