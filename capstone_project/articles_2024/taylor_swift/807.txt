Ariana Grande earned her eighth No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 this week as “Yes, And?” debuted in the top spot. “i am so so so……. so emotional,” she wrote on Instagram. “thank you from the bottom of my heart to my fans, the most incredible angels in the world, for the love you have shown this song and me.” The single dethroned Jack Harlow's "Lovin On Me," which spent the last two weeks at No. 1. Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” took third and Tate McRae’s Greedy took fourth. 21 Savage, who has the No. 1 album this week with American Dream, rounded out the top five with "Redrum.”
