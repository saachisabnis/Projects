Republican lawmakers piled pressure on Joe Biden to target Iran directly after an attack on an American base in Jordan by Iranian-backed militias killed three American soldiers on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, called for America to “hit Iran now”. The White House said it was seeking a “very consequential” response, but John Kirby, a White House spokesman, also said the government was “not looking for a war with Iran”. Iran distanced itself from the attacks, dismissing American claims of involvement as baseless.
