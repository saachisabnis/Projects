It's the moment you've been waiting for since the day you met: your partner got down on one knee and asked you to spend the rest of your lives together. (Obviously, the answer is yes.)
Once you and your future spouse have finished popping champagne, calling your parents, and admiring your new sparkler, you'll want to share news of the proposal with your extended family and friends.
Rather than calling or texting everyone you know individually, sharing your news on social media with an engagement caption is a perfect way to spread the excitement.
That's why we've compiled a list of engagement captions that are perfect for every type of relationship and proposal photo.
If you and your partner are rom-com buffs, music aficionados, or book lovers, these engagement captions will help you tell your unique love story. And if you’re looking for inspiration from the stars, check out some celebrity engagement captions from big names like Justin Bieber, Ciara, and Ed Sheeran.
You can't go wrong with lyrics from a classic love song, or a famous quote from one of literature's greatest romances.
Whether you're in search of something sweet or a funny engagement captions that will garner all the giggles, look no further than this list of engagement captions to help you share news of your joy.
