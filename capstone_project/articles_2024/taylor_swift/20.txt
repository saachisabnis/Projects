Kanye West owes over $1million in unpaid taxes as his messy finances continue to unravel.
The rapper, producer, and designer has endured a tumultuous couple of years since Adidas, Gap, Balenciaga and a host of other brands dropped him after his anti-Semitic rants - tanking his $2billion net worth down to $400million. 
Now DailyMail.com can reveal that his clothing firm, Yeezy Apparel, LLC, has four active tax liens filed against it over the last three years for unpaid business taxes totaling $934,033.56. 
To make matters worse, the rapper, who has shocked the world with his series of outbursts, also owes $101,093 in property taxes on two homes he owned with his ex-wife Kim Kardashian.

Kanye West's Yeezy Apparel has four active tax liens filed against it over the last three years for $934,033.56 in unpaid taxes 
The most recent demand from the State of California's Franchise Tax Board was in March 2023 for $319,356.58, which includes a $97,063.78 penalty and $9,644.40 in interest.
This stems from unpaid taxes between October 2021 and March 2022.
The rapper has two more ongoing tax liens against him. 
One was filed in September 2022 for the April to September 2021 period, in which the company owes $321,591.71 inclusive of penalties and interest.
Another was filed in February 2022 for $279,085.99, which includes a $92,374 penalty and interest. This was for the January 2020 to March 2021 period.
The first lien was in July 2021 for $13,999.28, inclusive of penalties and interest, for three months from April 2020.
In total, Yeezy Apparel owes $934,033.56.
Meanwhile, Kanye also owns two properties that have failed to pay property taxes.
One is a four-bedroom mansion in Calabasas, which he bought with ex Kim Kardashian in May 2018 for $2.2million. 
He was then given the 300-acre property as part of their divorce deal.
Kanye hasn't paid any taxes on that pad since 2021 - meaning he now owes a total of $81,154 - that's $26,759 in 2021, $26,781 in 2022 and $27,614 in 2023. 
The 46-year-old was also awarded a three-bedroom apartment in Calabasas, which he and Kim bought together for $1.6million in August 2017.
Yet he stopped paying taxes this year, which totals $19,939. 
For the two properties, unpaid property taxes stand at a combined $101,093.

Kanye is selling his minimalist Malibu mansion for $53million because its concrete walls are too gray, an insider revealed
In total, Kanye owes $1,035,126.56 in property and business taxes.
It remains to be seen whether he'll pay the hefty sum any time soon as the penalties continue racking up. 
His recent erratic behavior is mirrored by his business dealings, as it was revealed last month that the Malibu oceanfront property he bought for $57million in September 2021 was being put up for sale for $4million less.
This is despite it being a shell of a building after Kanye's builders ripped it apart and have now left it to rot. 
He's currently being sued by the project's manager Tony Saxon, who claims he wanted to turn it into a 'bomb shelter from the 1910s' and was told of the 'danger of such actions.'
The house now lacks doors, windows, plumbing, electrical systems, HVAC, and interior finishes.
'It will take several million dollars for the house to be finished,' realtor Jason Oppenheim told The Wall Street Journal. 'Much of the architectural integrity and the architectural value of the house exists.'
Kanye, now known as Ye, also abandoned plans to move his Yeezy operation to Wyoming.
The new Yeezy HQ is now on Melrose Ave in West Hollywood, but the building has fallen into disrepair. 
Instead of tending to the repairs, he's been seen gallivanting around the world with his Australian wife Bianca Censori, who he often dresses in scantily clad ensembles.

Adidas publicly parted ways with West in October 2022
Prior to his split with Adidas, Forbes estimated Kanye to be worth $2million, now it's down to $400million
In October 2022, Page Six reported that Kanye - who previously claimed to be a billionaire - could hit financial trouble, as sources said that while he has a large stash of cash, he also has vast expenses and could be in trouble if he doesn't turn the tide.
An insider revealed that he has 'a lot of cash by anyone's standards,' but he also has a 'high cash burn rate.'
The rapper  has been no stranger to scandal throughout his career, which has been marred by infamous public feuds with the likes of Taylor Swift, Drake and even the Kardashian family, whom he repeatedly attacked on social media. 
He was hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency in 2016  and first revealed his bipolar disorder diagnosis in 2018.
In addition to losing deals, he's lost the support of fans for his troubling comments - including claiming that 'slavery is a choice', and insisting that George Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose and was not murdered by Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin. 
In 2022, he was dropped by top talent agency CAA and Johnny Depp’s lawyer Camille Vasquez after he and and conservative commentator Candace Owens donned tops that read White Lives Matter during a Paris Fashion Week showcase for his Yeezy line.
Fashion bible Vogue decided not to work with Kanye in the future, fans have boycotted his music and thrown away items from his Yeezy line. 
According to Forbes, Kanye loss his billionaire status following the termination of his business contracts.
