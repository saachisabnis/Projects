She has no shame and we love it 
Think I only want one obsession in my life… Sabrina Carpenter’s Nonsense outros, obviously! Whether she’s making us laugh or cringe, the pop queen’s ever-changing lyrics certainly make our lives less boring.
First things first, for anyone who isn’t a huge Sabrina stan (YET), what are Sabrina Carpenter’s Nonsense outros? And how come they’ve been so successful to warrant a whole article being written about them?
You may be familiar with the hit song’s original outro: “This song catchier than chickenpox is/ I bet your house is where my other sock is/ Woke up this morning, thought I’d write a pop hit/ How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?” What you might not know is that, on every set she plays, Sabrina performs a second outro that changes every time playing tribute to the city she is performing in.
Just as Taylor Swift utilises the surprise factor of mystery songs played each night of her Eras Tour, Sabrina Carpenter, who opened during the South American leg of the tour, capitalises off her fans’ anticipation for new outros.
But, as you can guess from the tone of the original outro, Sabrina is not afraid of getting frisky. Here I am to rank her wildest Nonsense outros performed during #TSTheErasTour in a descending scale from cute to chaos. I could never insult something Sabrina writes so, by chaos, I mean you might want to cover the ears of your 12 year old sister for it.
Hardcore Swiftie here –  of course I had to pick this as the “cutest” outro. As someone who survived the whole Ticketmaster fiasco and bagged herself Eras tickets, I feel like Sabrina is addressing me here.

Another one for the Swifties. Fortunately, I don’t think the crowd’s demographic included the kind of man who would go mental about the “rent-ay” comment.

Do those shots Sabrina, we love a tipsy queen.
We’re beginning the descent into chaos now. Love the reference to Argentinian football superstar “Messi’ though!

The Obelisco of Buenos Aires is a tall national monument. How sweet that she’s making reference to the local culture, let’s not think too hard about what else she might be referencing…
Aww, isn’t she sweet? We know you’re a ten all of the time, Sabrina!

He said im the prettiest but how so?
Cause all the hottest girls are in São Paulo”

What is small, Sabrina? Certainly not your love for the fans in Rio anyway.
Apparently some fans heard her sing ‘pusita’.

Come put something big in my pusita

Very chaotic, but we’re here for it. We’re certainly not getting migraines from listening to your songs, Sabrina.
Sabrina! I see what you did there…

“Boy come over this is not a drill
He said get on top, I said I will
Then he made me come… to Brazil”

If you haven’t caught the L-O-V-E for Sabrina from this list alone, I suggest you put on some headphones and get listening. She may be chaotic, but the ‘Carpenters’ love her for it.
