Michelle Obama has zero plans to run for president in 2024.
After rumors resurfaced that the former FLOTUS was launching a bid for the White House in 2024, a member of Michelle's team insists that she's supporting Joe Biden's reelection campaign.
"As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president," director of communications for the 60-year-old's office, Crystal Carson, told People.
"Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign," she added.
According to NBC News, Michelle's involvement in Biden and Harris' 2024 campaign would be limited as she is reluctant "to re-enter the political fray full time."
