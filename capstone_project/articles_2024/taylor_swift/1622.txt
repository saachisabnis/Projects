BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — A bevy of pop stars made an appearance at this year’s Super Bowl.
Taylor Swift, of course, rooted on boyfriend Travis Kelce as Kansas City won its third title. Usher, Alicia Keys, Ludacris and more performed at the halftime show.

But perhaps the most surprising moment came during an ad break when Ben Affleck shouted “What’s up Bronx!” as he entered a recording studio in a failed attempt to convince wife Jennifer Lopez to put his new pop band, The DunKings, featuring Matt Damon and Tom “Tommy Touchdown” Brady, on an album.
J Lo was not impressed. Following the performance of “Don’t Dunk Away at My Heart,” a dejected Affleck walked away with a mortified Damon. “Chill, they’re naming a drink after us,” Affleck told his longtime friend.
The DunKings iced coffee and Munchkins skewer, among other “DunKings” items, became available Monday.
Now you can fulfill what I’m sure has been a dream for many: Drink coffee with a row of doughnut holes protruding from the top of the cup. It’s reminiscent of a martini with olives, but without the alcohol or sophistication.

The skewer can be placed in any Dunkin’ drink. I got what the chain says is Affleck’s usual iced coffee order — topped with sweet cold foam and cinnamon sugar — and popped in the skewer. It made for fun photos.
I’m not big on sweet drinks (I take my coffee with about a thimbleful of cream, no sugar), but the cinnamon sugar left a nice aftertaste.
More than anything, my DunKings purchase reflects the power of a great ad. It made me laugh, I watched it repeatedly and I couldn’t wait to place my order first thing this morning.
We may never get another single from the DunKings, but at least we can sip and snack like them.
