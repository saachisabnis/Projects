The way Taylor Swift fans treat each other reminded Eddie Vedder of how people treated each other when he went to punk rock shows.
The Pearl Jam frontman told Mojo about taking one of his daughters to a Swift Eras concert and he said that “The run-up to it, making friendship bracelets with her and the generosity of these young girls and boys, trading these bracelets with different messages on them -- lyrics, song titles, just acts of good will on these little bracelets. They had found their tribe; they were all agreeing on something."
He added, "The craziest thing was it reminded me of punk rock crowds, of being aligned with all of the misfits in our town, back in the day. It was galvanizing and powerful."
