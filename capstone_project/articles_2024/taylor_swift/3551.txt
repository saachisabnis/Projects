	The Minnesota Twins came into the 2024 Major League Baseball season with a true ace. Pablo López leads a rotation that will look to him for dominance over opponents, a high volume of innings, and intangible leadership qualities. Now his starts will come with extra joy, as well.


Since the Minnesota Twins traded Luis Arráez for Pablo López, the team's right-handed starter has spent the duration of his time here winning over fans. With a gigantic smile and a great personality (plus some heroic playoff poise), López has earned the favor of Twins Territory. His starts have been dubbed “Pablo Day” since some point late in the 2023 season, and now they have an official feel to them.


On Monday, the Twins announced that every López start at Target Field will be dubbed “Pablo Day,” and that it will include a ticket package to celebrate. The package is described in detail on a special ticketing landing page. “Each time our ace, Pablo López, takes the mound in 2024, it’s PABLO DAY! This special ticket package includes a ticket to the game and a Pablo-themed jersey, paying homage to his Venezuelan roots. Plus, a portion of the proceeds from this ticket package benefit Ruff Start, Children’s Minnesota, and Project Success non-profits.”


Pablo and his wife Kaylee gleaned inspiration for this new offering through their love of Twins fans, the local community of which they have become a part, and a desire to give back. Forty-eight hours before each scheduled home start, the “Pablo Day” tickets will go on sale. The promotion kicks off in May and lasts through September.


The tickets purchased for “Pablo Day” will all be located in a designated section at Target Field. Talking to the media during a press conference for the reveal, López noted how much he loved seeing Félix Hernández’s “King’s Court” at Seattle Mariners games. He hopes that seeing fans wearing his jersey, in his section, might give him a bit of a bump on the mound, as well.


While it’s Johan Santana that Lopez has often talked of when listing off his favorite pitchers of all time, Hernández is also from Venezuela. Seeing López climb the ranks of pitchers across the league, and ultimately ascend as one of the next greats from Venezuela, would be a great development for Twins fans.


St. Paul Throws a Block Party
	It’s not just the Twins who are home this week either. While Minnesota goes on the road Thursday, the St. Paul Saints are home through the weekend and are throwing a block party to celebrate. Inviting fans to enjoy happy hour at Lowertown establishments pregame, the Saints will throw a first pitch at 4:07 pm on Tuesday to wrap the evening up with baseball.


On Wednesday, the Saints are celebrating National Sibling Day, and on Thursday, they pay homage to the local directory assistance line on 4-11 with Thirsty Thursday drink specials. Friday is for the Swifties, with DJ Swiftie bringing a collection of Taylor Swift’s songs to the stadium, and a fan will be given two tickets to the pop star's Miami show in October. It wouldn’t be a Friday at CHS Field without fireworks, either. Giveaways continue at the ballpark on Saturday with magnet schedules being handed out, and Sunday will be a sensory-friendly game. The Saints, known for their wild antics, will dial everything back a bit so everyone can enjoy a relaxing day at the ballpark.


Between “Pablo Day” and a week’s worth of Saints excitement, baseball should be the talk of the town(s) in Minneapolis and St. Paul this week.

	That's a great 💡 idea!

	I'm confused.  The Saints are inviting fans to celebrate happy at local businesses in Lower town, but starting the game at 4:00PM?  Is happy hour from 1:00 to 4:00 or 7:00 to 10:00?  I thought happy hour was usually from 4:00 to 6:00?
