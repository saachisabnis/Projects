If you're trying to guess who the most popular celebrity in New Jersey is, you may want to know how the results were determined.
It's pretty simple. It comes from data revealing which celebrities were searched for on Google more than any other from data published in early 2024 by Glimpse.
We simply went down the list of the most Googled celebrities on the list and didn't stop until we hit our first celebrity from New Jersey. It didn't take very long.
The first New Jersey star on the list comes in at # 21, and it's Tom Cruise. We were searched over 1 million times.
You have to dig a little deeper to find the second New Jersey celebrity on the list,Â  but you will find Danny DeVito at #106.
The amazingly talented and versatile performer Queen Latifah holds the #136 spot on this list, and that's it for the top 150.
No, there is no Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep, Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen or John Travolta on the list.
If you don't know who the holder of the top spot is on the list then you are either living under a rock or refusing to listen to the radio or watch the NFL. And you're certainly not a music or Kansas City Chiefs fan.
Taylor Swift is at #1 with well over 10,000,000 searches in 30 days at the time the data was compiled.
