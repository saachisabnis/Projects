The Brothers Sun
The Franchise
The Mole Agent
No Good Deed
Ted
The Franchise The Mole Agent
The former has been confirmed for a Q3/Q4 release whilst the latter hasn’t even started shooting yet.
TV FYC: Kevin Kline ("Disclaimer), Bridget Everett ("Somebody Somewhere"), Severance in all categories
Give Meg Ryan the Oscar vehicle she deserves!
I hope Mr and Mrs Smith is really good that it runs away with some wins because while I love The Bear it’s not a comedy.
Lol I can like with 90% of confidence say that Mr & Mrs Smith will also be a drama passing as a comedy if it goes comedy.
Stream MAYHEM, give Sarah Snook her Tony, Colin Farrell his Emmy and make Severance, The Studio + The Pitt sweep all awards!
The 3x Emmy Winner for Best Drama Series, Succession!
The review embargo for Mr. and Mrs. Smith lifts on February 1st (a day before its release).

Gomez could absolutely be nominated this year. Have you seen the field? 
She’s at least 4th right now and Only Murders will probably be a top 3 show given how weak and barren the field is most likely going to be. She could easily miss if multiple shows breakout at the same time, but right now I have confidence in her making it in, especially if she actively campaigns, but I do agree that if she misses in a weak year like this then it’s never going to happen for her.
FYC:
Only Murders in the Building: Outstanding Comedy Series
Selena Gomez: Lead Actress in a Comedy Series
Steve Martin: Lead Actor in a Comedy Series
Martin Short: Lead Actor in a Comedy Series
Her odds lie on the spring contenders. First if Mr and Mrs Smith and Palm Royale indeed compete here, second if they are good, third if they are watched, etc etc.
The odds are on her favor right now.

Not surprised. The trailers have been awful. Probably gonna be a non-factor.
FYC:
- “Andor” in all categories
- Jean Smart (Hacks)
- John Turturro (Severance)
- Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)
Selena is not that far out, people are letting their personal biases through on her if they think that.

I really hope she gets it this time! One thing about Hulu that frustrates me is that The Great would be such a strong contender for this Emmy season had they held off releasing S3. I don’t understand why they didn’t realize it because it cost Elle another deserved nomination, but I’m just happy that both Elle and Nicholas at least have noms to their names (should be wins but that’s a topic for another day).
Just everything Hulu.

The Great is so gonna become a cult classic I feel it in my bones. What a show. God that was a stupid release date. ur parent really messed up on that one.
From the river to the sea
It won’t be a thing, but the Ted show has been going viral on Twitter, getting 120k likes in one tweet about it.
I have been patiently waiting for Girls5eva to have its deserved moment and Renee Elise Goldsberry to dominate.

I suspect Peacock’s specific push might be Character Voiceover for Seth McFarlane, the actual animation/character design stuff could get through too.

She would be suuuuuuch a worthy winner
