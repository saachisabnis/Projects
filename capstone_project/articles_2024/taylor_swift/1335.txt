Two brothers from southwest Louisiana may still be stuck in a "Lavender Haze" after receiving a Grammy on Sunday for their work on Taylor Swift's latest album, "Midnights."
Lake Charles natives Mikey Freedom Hart and brother David Hart each took home an Album of the Year award for their role in the production and engineering of Swift's record-breaking album. 
While the Grammy is a first for David, it is Mikey's second.

Mikey, a member of the rock band Bleachers, previously received an Album of the Year award in 2022 for his work on New Orleans native Jon Batiste's "We Are" album. Mikey was also nominated that year for his work on Swift's "evermore" album. 
David and Mikey are credited in the production of the "Midnights" songs "Bejeweled" and "Mastermind."
The Album of the Year win made history for Swift, marking her as the only artist to have received the honor four times.
Swift also received a Grammy for best pop vocal album and, during her acceptance speech, announced her upcoming album "The Tortured Poet's Department," which will be released on April 19.
Swift is set to perform in New Orleans in October as part of her Eras Tour, leaving many Louisiana fans wondering if they'll get to hear songs from the future album.
