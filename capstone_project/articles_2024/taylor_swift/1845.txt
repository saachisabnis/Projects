“This is no small thing, to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption. I have studied history for years and I cannot recall it ever happening. It may be that our task is impossible. Yet, if we do not try then how will we know it can’t be done? And if we do not try, it most certainly won’t be done. The Founders’ Republic, and the larger war for western civilization, will be lost.”
“But I tell you this: We will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night. Indeed, we will make with our defiance such a sound as ALL history from that day forward will be forced to note, even if they despise us in the writing of it.” 
~ Mike Vanderboegh

Sadly … I just watched the ABC Evening News … because it followed my local news. And in doing the the story about the Lakewood Church shooting in Houston … they never mentioned the “Transgender” status of the shooter.  Simply ignored it … and said the police will reveal the motive for the shooting in 30 days … when hopefully everyone has long forgotten about this violent attack on Christians by a mentally ill “Transgender” whack job
Who is the guy who killed two police officers and an EMT in a Minneapolis suburb yesterday? Nothing on the murderer? No name. No photo?
Anybody in Minnesota know!
I saw of some post from Alpha News MN the guys name is Shannon Cortez Gooden

Glad this was on network TV.
The question is why in the holy hell would anybody listen to what this guy says. Listen to him speak to Larry Elder. The guy backtracked a thousand times. Larry was spectacular.

And all so incredibly predictable (and predicted at the time). 
Meanwhile an army of shrill experts will warn that we must pursue a policy to “weaken” Russia and China even as they promote a policy that does the opposite. https://t.co/vEeOOVJJts

And then they mail them a ballot and let them vote. As Obama said, just check the box that says you’re legally allowed to vote. No one will check.
The insurance companies then want to sell them insurance.
Ka-ching!!!!

(POLL) 78% of Democrats want Trump off the ballot

This remind you of anyone? It’s uncanny.
Has anyone seen this Gofundme for Trump. and know if this is truly for Trump or is it a scam?
https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-trump-raise-the-settlement
The concensus is that it looks like a scam, going to an individual person not an escrow account, using GoFundMe not GiveSendGo, not verified by PDJT, and questionable how it would be legally collected and transferred to PDJT in an eletion year in a manner that aligns with FEC election funding laws –etc.

Why is a county DA posing with, if real, millions of dollars in cash?

Many Reporters Paid for Covering the Russiagate Story
(Media figures who exposed illegal surveillance, manufactured intelligence, and other abuses in the Trump-Russia investigation almost always paid a price)

Doesn’t it seem that this must be SOP for every lie the MSM has told about Trump?
I mean, they’ve gotta know they’re lying, so there must be something in it for them.

Hence, destroy the state.
