Jerrod Carmichael is opening up about his unexpected photo with his "best friend" Taylor Swift.
The comedian recently visited Jimmy Kimmel Live!, making an appearance on the late night talk show on Wednesday, March 20.
While responding to host Jimmy Kimmel's inquiry about the picture in question—an image of the duo together in a luxury box suite during a Kansas City Chiefs game at Buffalo, New York's Highmark Stadium in January—The Carmichael Show star made the bold claim that "she knows more about football" than he does. The 36-year-old is seemingly not really a fan of the sport, since even Swift, herself, has also just been opened up to the world of football over the past several months due to dating NFL star, Travis Kelce.

Additionally, Carmichael noted that the pop star is his "best friend," adamantly clearing up, however, that although he is not hers, the opposite can, apparently, still be true.
"Can you think of a better friend to have than Taylor Swift?" he asked, before hilariously adding, "I called my former best friend and was like 'You're out, Taylor's in.' You've never invited me on your jet to a game," a joke which was met with boisterous laughter from the studio audience.
He continued, saying "she knows more about football," and confirming, "I'm the girlfriend in that situation," after Kimmel inquired if he had asked her questions about the game. "I do love her, though."
All in all, the Poor Things actor noted that Swift is "very smart and interesting," and there must be some truth to that, as the "Lavender Haze" singer has a plethora of good pals—Blake Lively, Selena Gomez, Emma Stone, Zoe Kravitz, Keleigh Teller, Cara Delevingne, Antoni Porowski, and now, Brittany Mahomes, just to name a few.
