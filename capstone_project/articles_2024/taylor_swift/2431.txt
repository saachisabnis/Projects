The romance between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift continues to be a dominant topic in the entertainment world. During this time, the Kansas City Chiefs star has been exposed to a new fan base of Swifties, and his presence is starting to show on them during Taylor’s tour.
In the latest episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, Jason asked his younger brother about the 87 Travis Kelce jerseys worn by Swift’s fans at the Eras Tour.
"There [were] a few. There’s a good amount of American football crowd out there," said Travis. "I think just, like, Taylor fans, so they wanted to show their support."
The ‘Swifties’ are enjoying their time as part of Chiefs Kingdom since the 2023 season. Travis told to his brother how much he appreciated Taylor’s fanbase showing love back to him and the franchise during her concerts while also saluting Jason’s retirement.
“It’s pretty [expletive] cool to just have your jersey being worn," the tight end explained. "Like, even if it’s just a day or at a football game right now, I guarantee you, there’s people out in Philly right now wearing your jersey. Guarantee it."
The Chiefs Kingdom fans and Swifties have been a healthy match alongside Kelce and Swift. The look ahead to 2024 is for the growing fanbases to take things to the next level.
