Camila Cabello attends the “Rob Peace” Premiere during the 2024 Sundance Film Festival at Eccles Center Theatre on January 22, 2024 in Park City, Utah. Shawn Mendes attends the Loewe Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on March 01, 2024 in Paris, France.
Camila Cabello has made a tough decision that many adults give into -- getting back with their ex. The "Havana" singer, who recently celebrated her 27th birthday, admitted in a new interview that her brief rekindled romance with ex-boyfriend Shawn Mendes wasn't a regret. Last summer, the two singers, who collaborated on "Señorita" together in 2019, got back together more than two years after they separated in November 2021.
In this week's Call Her Daddy podcast, the Fifth Harmony alum said it is known she is a "fan" of getting back together with an ex. "I support it, supported it in the past," she said. On the March 6 episode, Cabello finds rekindling and exploring an ex again is helpful for the following reasons: see if there's still something there or it gets them out of your system ("date him until you hate him"), as well as the realization that it's not going to work.

The Miami native isn't free from her friends voicing their criticisms of her choice to get back with an ex, but she finds it has been "helpful for me." She admits it is somewhat of a waste of time to entertain a failed relationship instead of finding somebody who could be better for her. Cabello, who is currently single, adds that she is all about breakup sex as long as the person is doing the "inner work" and asking what the motive behind it is.
As for getting back with Mendes, 25, she states, "You can't forbid things from me because I will want to do it more." Expressing that she will text him regardless of outside opinions, Cabello is fully aware of learning things the hard way. Comparing herself to Ryan Gosling's character in The Notebook, the Cuban singer-songwriter would rather build "a house" for her person rather than have regrets for not doing anything. She and Mendes dated for two years and showed up at Coachella last year. Their rekindled romance lasted a few months.
Though she acted on her impulses, Cabello said it was fun. She also said the former couple both agreed that the second time around didn't "feel right." Her bounce-back was quick, since this time, it took less time for them to realize that. They agreed there wasn't any bad blood and still had love for each other to want both parties to move on and be friends instead. Now, Shawn seems to be her favorite ex, calling her other exes "awful" and him "a good person."
Last month on TikTok, Cabello posted a clip with the text: "At the end of the day it's that song you have to skip because it reminds you too much of that time in your life." She added in the caption: "and it is a visceral ache." The song she used for the video was a cover of Cage the Elephant's "Cigarette Daydreams." One fan commented: "Camila since when were you this relatable? [crying emoji]"
Prior to that, Cabello posted a clip that said, "When #1 on the roster leaves you on delivered so u gotta act like you always wanted #2." In January, she also poked fun at herself at the realization "u can't blame dumb decisions on being young anymore cuz you're a grown a-- woman."
Cabello's also teasing new music, with a song called "I luv it." Her website states: "Coming soon" with a pre-save link.
2023 has seen a lot of celebrity deaths -- and deaths in love due to breakups. Some couples have called it quits after years of being together. New relationships formed that looked as though they were meant for each other.
We've all wished for some relationships to have stayed together, despite not knowing what goes on behind closed doors. Celebrities are a prime example of not knowing what they are like in real life versus the facade of a perfect relationship they put out there.
Sometimes, fans are more upset than the celebrities who are going through the breakup! When Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn called it quits after 5 years together and a rumored secret marriage, fans professed they gave up on love entirely. Others used the breakups as a way to bash celebrities. Ariana Grande's divorce announcement to Dalton Gomez caused viral videos of her alleged years of cheating on partners. As for the couples who share children together, our hearts broke for the ones we thought were happily ever afters.
Take a look below at all the major celebrity relationships that have come to an end in 2023.
