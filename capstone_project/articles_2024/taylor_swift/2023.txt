Look what she made him do.
Taylor Swift hyped up a nervous Ross Travis, who is her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s best friend, when it was his turn to feed a lion during their recent trip to the Sydney Zoo.
The former Kansas City Chiefs player, 31, posted a clip of the moment on Instagram Friday, which showed him hesitantly approaching a cage with the wild cat pacing behind it.
“Alright, Ross,” Swift, 34, can be heard telling Travis while recording a video on a smartphone.
The zookeeper then instructs the pro football player how to properly feed the lion and be it’s “best friend” without getting hurt.
Travis can then be seen sliding the stick of meat through a hole in the cage, prompting Swift to tell him, “Beautifully done,” as the NFL free agent lets out a huge sigh of relief.
One fan commented under the post, “Taylor recording is giving big sister vibes and I’m here for it 🥹.”
Another added, “TAY’S VOICEEEEEE EEEEEKKKK SHE’S SO SUPPORTIVE.”
It appears that Travis and Swift have formed a close bond amid the latter’s romance with Kelce, also 34.
They spent some time together in stadium suites supporting the Chiefs tight end amid the NFL season, and it’s been known that Swift has gotten along well with Kelce’s inner circle.
“She’s there to support him and cheer him on, and she has fit in seamlessly with everyone he loves,” an insider told People in January.
Travis publicly praised the pop superstar Friday after attending her first Eras Tour concert in Sydney alongside Kelce.
“I understand now… That. Was. Amazing,” he wrote over an image of his outfit via his Instagram Story after the sold-out show.
Videos circulating online showed Swifties gave Travis and Kelce a warm welcome as they walked through the crowd to the VIP tent, while the latter high-fived fans and handed out guitar picks.
Travis recognized the support in his Instagram caption Friday, writing, “Didn’t get to wrestle a Kangaroo, but made 80,000 new friends DOWN UNDER 🤙🏽.”

He also posted a clip in his slideshow of people approaching him to dance with him at Swift’s concert.
Travis and Kelce’s whirlwind trip to Australia is now over, as they two are already headed back to the US.
Page Six confirmed Friday that the “Catching Kelce” alum was aboard a private jet on his way to Las Vegas to meet up with Patrick Mahomes and the rest of teammates, as the Chiefs are still celebrating their Super Bowl 2024 win against the San Francisco 49ers.
Swift, meanwhile, had to stay behind in Sydney, as she still has two more shows there on Sunday and Monday. She will then jet off to Singapore to continue the international leg of her Eras Tour.
