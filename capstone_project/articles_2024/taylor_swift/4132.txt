Kanye West has revealed his desire to have a threesome with a beloved First Lady: Michelle Obama.
In an interview with Justin Laboy on The Download podcast, which dropped on Sunday (April 21), the social media personality asked Ye about his desire to have a ménage à trois with “anybody in the world,” while also insinuating that he knew who the rapper would choose before he could say it.

“Michelle Obama,” Ye replied without missing a beat before letting out a hearty laugh. “Gotta fuck the President’s wife!”
Check out the clip below.
Back in 2018, Kanye West linked up with Michelle Obama (sort of) when Childish Gambino put an animated version of Ye, wearing a red MAGA hat, crying and getting hugged by the First Lady in his video for “Feels Like Summer.”
The Chicago rap icon also has history with her husband Barack Obama, who famously called Kanye a “jackass” after he interrupted Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.

Elsewhere in the same interview, Ye took shots at Drake and his “rich baby daddy” Sir Lucian Grainge, who is the CEO of Universal Music Group and has been responsible for the signings of some of the biggest names in music including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Kanye himself.
Grainge was also mentioned in Ye’s remix of Future and Metro Boomin‘s “Like That,” which contains shots at both Drake and J. Cole.

But as Ye claimed in the interview, the $400 million deal Drizzy struck with the powerhouse company two years ago came at the expense of his very soul.
“Drake has a rich baby daddy named Lucian and Universal,” he said. “He’s like, ‘Man, my daddy got it!’ You know what I’m saying? ‘My daddy control the spins! My daddy got the DSPs!’ Drake has a rich baby daddy. Lucian work for the people who control the banks in Africa.”

West also suggested that his falling out with the 6 God — with whom he seemingly reconciled at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert in late 2022 — had a more celestial origin.
“It cuts Drake’s soul,” he continued. “It’s like he signed his soul to the Devil to not be cool with me. This is his job, to go against God.”

Kanye further explained how his “Like That (Remix)” came about and referred to the current rap war involving Drizzy, Kendrick Lamar, Future, Rick Ross and others as “the elimination of Drake.”
“Pluto called me, I went to the studio and laid that,” he said. “Everybody was very, very excited about the elimination of Drake. Not excited — we was energized.”
