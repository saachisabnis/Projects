Rebel Wilson has claimed that she will reveal the 'massive a**hole' she worked with in Hollywood in her new book.
The comedian, 44, is gearing up to release her hotly-anticipated memoir Rebel Rising next month, and she hasn't shied away from giving some very candid details.
She took to Instagram on Saturday to reveal that she has dedicated a whole chapter in her book to a 'massive a**hole' she worked with in Hollywood.
The Pitch Perfect actress claimed she will name which male colleague prompted her to adopt a 'no a**holes policy' with everyone she works with.
She shared: 'When I first came to Hollywood, people were like, "Yeah, I have a no-a**holes policy that means, like, I don't work with a**holes". I was like, "Yeah, I mean, that sounds sensible and logical.'

'But then it really sunk in what they were meaning by that, older people in the industry. Because I worked with a massive a**hole, and, yeah, now I definitely have a a**holes policy.
'Chapter on said a**hole - it is chapter 23, that guy was a massive a**hole.'
She added on her Instagram Stories: 'Do you want to know who is the biggest a**hole I've ever worked with in Hollywood? Chapter 23 lists it all out!'
In a caption, she continued to tease: 'Do you wanna know why I have a 'no a**holes' policy now with people I work with?'
'Well it's all in the book: REBEL RISING available for pre-order now (drops April 2nd, link in bio)… oh and YES I name the a**hole!'

Her revelation comes after Rebel recently celebrated her 44th birthday, taking to Instagram to mark the occasion.
In the sweet post, she gushed over her fiancée Ramona Agruma, 40, and their daughter Royce, 15 months.
She posted a picture of herself striking a playful pose as she seemingly enjoyed a sun-soaked day out on a boat to celebrate the special day.
In the snap, she cut a stylish figure in a floral print gown and a white cardigan and shielded her eyes with a pair of dark sunglasses.
She sweetly described her family as the 'best present ever' in the caption of her birthday post.
The actress penned: 'Happy 44th birthday to me! I got the best present ever - a healthy child, a healthy relationship and a career that keeps challenging me (directing a new film, writing a book, producing AND acting) and so many amazing friends and fans who inspire me to keep going! Love you all x'
