The Golden Globes might be over, but photos from the night are the gift that keeps on giving because Mookie Betts is the second Dodgers player to be spotted discreetly attending the star-studded event.
The Golden Globes are producing new Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez memes, celebrity-on-celebrity fangirl moments and even lip-reading analysis. Still, the most underrated gift from the whole event has been spotting Dodgers players just casually hanging out.
First, it was Freddie Freeman photobombing Taylor Swift. Now, some serious investigators have found his teammate Mookie Betts reacting to Jo Koy's horrific opening monologue, and it's absolutely glorious.
Right on cue, MLB fans came with the jokes, and they did not disappoint.
