AI-generated pornographic images of Taylor Swift were released on social media, sparking outrage among her fans. The images generated 27 million views and 260,000 likes in 19 hours before Twitter/X cracked down on the posts, which show Swift nude and in sexual positions. It's not clear who created the deepfakes, but Facebook, Instagram and Reddit quickly joined Twitter in trying to prevent them from spreading. “Protect Taylor Swift” began trending yesterday as fans tried to drown out interest in the images and reported any accounts that shared them. “the taylor swift ai images are insane. actually terrifying that they exist. please report + don’t give more attention to those tweets. some of these men really need to be locked in a cage and shipped off to mars or smth” wrote one user.
