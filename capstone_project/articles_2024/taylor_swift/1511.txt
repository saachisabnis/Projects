Bet $5, Get $200
New FanDuel users in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee can receive $200 in bonus bets regardless of the outcome of their initial $5 wager. Similar to the national offer, you don't need a FanDuel promo code to access this offer, but you must make a $5 deposit to qualify. 
This offer expires on June 2, 2025.
FanDuel's welcome promo is awarded in bonus bets, which are non-redeemable and can only be used on-site. You can withdraw profits you've earned from FanDuel bonus bets. For example, if you win $500 using your $200 in bonus bets, you can withdraw $200 from your account. You sometimes have to wager your bonus bets a certain number of times before redeeming any winnings, but that's not the case with the latest FanDuel offer. 
Unlike regular funds, bonus bets expire and will be automatically removed from your account after a certain period. In this case, it's seven days (168 hours) from issuance.
$500 No Sweat First Bet
No code required
FanDuel Racing is ready for today's 151st running of the Kentucky Derby. Register today and claim our Covers-verified welcome bonus today — a $500 No Sweat First Bet on any race. FanDuel will return the full amount as Racing Credit if you lose, and no FanDuel Racing promo code is necessary.
Here's a quick breakdown of the current FanDuel Racing promo:
 Make an initial $0.10 deposit into your newly created FanDuel Racing account.
 If you win your first bet, you do not receive a bonus.
 If you lose your first bet, you receive the full amount back in Racing Credit, up to $500. You have seven days to use your Racing Credit.
 The bonus is non-withdrawable, but you may withdraw winnings earned from the Racing Credit immediately.
 This Covers-verified FanDuel Kentucky Derby bonus if available in the following U.S. states: AZ, AK, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, ID, IL, IN, IA, KY, LA, MD, MA, MI, MN, MT, NH, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, PA, RI, SD, VA, WA, WV, and WY. 
We appreciate the straightforward terms for the latest FanDuel welcome offer, allowing bettors of all experience levels to grab it easily.   
The DraftKings Sportsbook welcome bonus is the most comparable, although you don't have to win your initial DraftKings wager to unlock the promo. Caesars and BetMGM have more valuable offers that are less accessible for the average bettor. To fully maximize the BetMGM offer, you need to invest $1,500. Meanwhile with Caesars Sportsbook, you have to use your 10 profit boosts very strategically to unlock close to its maximum value.
Claiming an online sports betting sites' new-user incentive can sometimes be tricky. This is why we've broken down the sign-up process below to help you easily score the latest FanDuel promo for new users:
Click here if you are at least 21 years old and reside in one of the following legal state — AZ, CO, CT, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, MD, MA, MI, NC, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VT, VI, and WV, (+PR) — and you'll be redirected to the FanDuel log in page. Users in DC KY and WY must be 18 to use FanDuel.
Provide your personal information, such as date of birth and mailing and email address, and your Social Security Number (SSN). Don't forget to download the FanDuel Sportsbook mobile app, which you need to claim your bonus. You are ineligible to use FanDuel if you are on any self-exclusion lists for gambling. If you are struggling, please refer to FanDuel's responsible gaming features on this page for assistance. 
Since this is not a FanDuel promo code no deposit bonus, you'll have to deposit unds into your newly created FanDuel Sportsbook account. To claim your welcome bonus, you must make a minimum deposit of $5.
Placing your first real money wager is next on the agenda. New users who make a winning $5 initial wager will get a guaranteed $200 in bonus bets. You will not receive a bonus if the bet loses.  
Your FanDuel promo funds will appear in your account within 72 hours of the bet settlement. Complete a 1x playthrough requirement to unlock your winnings.
There are presently 22 states (plus DC and PR) in which FanDuel Sportsbook legally operates. FanDuel is expected to join Missouri sports betting when the state goes live in 2025, likely in time for the 2025-26 NFL season. If you are 21 or over and within one of these locations' borders, you'll be eligible to nab the sportsbook's latest promotional offer.
