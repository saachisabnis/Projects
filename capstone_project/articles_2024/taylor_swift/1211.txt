Go girl! Kristin Juszczyk has scored an NFL deal after making that custom jacket for Taylor Swift and other WAGs. 
Kristin Juszczyk, who is married to San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, went viral for her designs following Swift's appearance on Jan. 13 at her boyfriend Travis Kelce's game, where the pop star was wearing a jacket made by the designer.
The day Swift wore the custom puffer jacket — which was emblazoned with Kelce’s name and No. 87 on the back — she had reason to bundle up. It was -4 degrees at kickoff, making it the fourth coldest game in NFL history. Swift's friend and fellow WAG Brittany Mahomes donned a nearly identical jacket created by Juszczyk but featuring Patrick Mahomes' name and No. 15.
We can't wait to see what she creates for the big game. Super Bowl 58 will feature the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs squaring off in Las Vegas on Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium.
