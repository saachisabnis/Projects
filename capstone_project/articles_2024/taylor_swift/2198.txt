#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
There's something whimsical about hot air balloons, and you can see dozens of them in Illinois this summer.
There's something kind of whimsical about seeing a hot air balloon in the sky, and these days we don't seem to see them very often.  Hot air balloons have been around since the 1700s and work on the heat-rising principle. Virgin Balloon Flights explains:
A hot air balloon is a unique flying craft which works because hot air rises. There are two main types of hot air balloon. Both were developed in the late 18th century and are still used today.
You can see dozens of hot air balloons in Illinois this summer at the Centralia Balloon Fest.
Centralia, Illinois is a little more than halfway between Evansville and St. Louis, so it isn't a far drive from the Tri-State.  Every year the small city of Centralia hosts the annual Balloon Fest, and this year they're getting ready to host dozens of hot air balloons for the festival.
The Centralia Balloon Fest will take place on August 16th, 17th, and 18th 2024. According to the Facebook event page, there will even be a performance by Josh Gracin!
Each day there are different events to celebrate the festival, like a balloon glow event where you can see the hot air balloons light up the night.  They'll also have hot air balloon flights, a Taylor Swift tribute concert, and country artist Josh Gracin will perform on Saturday the 17th!
For more information, you can check out the Cenralia Ballon Fest website, here.
