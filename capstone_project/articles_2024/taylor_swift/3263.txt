New month, new wallpapers! To cater for a fresh dose of colorful inspiration on a regular basis, we embarked on our monthly wallpapers journey more than 13 years ago. It’s the perfect occasion for creatives to put their artistic skills to the test, indulge in a little project just for fun, or tell the story they’ve always wanted to tell. Of course, it wasn’t any different this time around.
In this post, you’ll find beautiful, unique, and inspiring wallpapers for April 2024. Created with love by artists and designers from across the globe, they come in versions with and without a calendar and can be downloaded for free. As a little bonus goodie, we also added some April favorites from our wallpapers archives to the collection — maybe you’ll rediscover one of your almost-forgotten favorites in here, too? A big thank you to everyone who shared their designs with us this month! Happy April!
