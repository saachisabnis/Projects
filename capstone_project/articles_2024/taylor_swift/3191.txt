About this rating 


On March 28, 2024, X (formerly Twitter) user @PapiTrumpo posted an image (archived here) in which Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce apparently sported a shirt that read "Trump Won." The post received more than 1 million views and 22,000 likes, as of this writing.
"Travis's version of being passive-aggressive with his girlfriend," wrote one commenter, referencing 14-time Grammy Award-winning artist Taylor Swift — seen with Kelce in the photo — who endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

The image was doctored to appear as though the shirt read "Trump Won." A community note attached to the post pointed to the source of the original photo (in which Kelce wore a blank white shirt) in Elle magazine (archived here).

The photo was taken while the two were vacationing in the Bahamas, and the photo was described in the article as follows:
Swift and Kelce were photographed holding hands while getting onto a boat in photos taken on March 20 and published this afternoon. Style-wise, Swift paired a pink cropped camisole with white shorts and a Polo Ralph Lauren baseball cap. Kelce wore his blue swimming trunks with a white T-shirt.
The account that posted the false image, @PapiTumpo, mentions in its bio that it posts "a little bit of parody…" We've previously reported on similarly doctored images from the account; one, posted in February 2024, was a video depicting Swift carrying a sign that read: "Trump Won, Democrats Cheated." 
Kelce has not publicly endorsed any presidential candidate, although Trump did mention Kelce in a Truth Social post on Feb. 11, 2024: "I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can't stand me!"
