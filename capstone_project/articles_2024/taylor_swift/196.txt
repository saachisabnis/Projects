Selena Gomez is attempting to put an end to the chatter.
Two days after sparking speculation that she was gossiping about Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner to Taylor Swift at the Golden Globes, she has revealed what their conversation was about.
“I told Taylor about two of my friends who hooked up,” she commented on E! News’ Instagram post. 
“Not that that’s anyone business,” she added.
Fans were sent into a frenzy during Sunday’s Golden Globes when Gomez was caught spilling tea to Swift and Keleigh Sperry in a video shared from inside the event.
Lip reader Jeremy Freeman exclusively told Page Six that the Rare Beauty founder said, “He didn’t want a picture with me. He said no.”
Sperry, who is married to Miles Teller, was thought to have clarified, “Timothée?”

The “Only Murders in the Building” star, 31, then nodded her head in response. 
Swift, meanwhile, opened her mouth in shock. 
Chalamet and Jenner, who have been linked since April 2023, looked smitten while sitting together at the Golden Globes. They were even caught sharing some passionate smooches.
Freeman even told Page Six exclusively that the 26-year-old makeup mogul told her actor beau that she loved him as they were caught in a cozy exchange.
While Gomez and Jenner have reportedly been at odds in the past, Chalamet, 28, claimed that the two have no bad blood while speaking to TMZ in Beverly Hills, Calif., Monday night.
After a photog asked whether he and Gomez — whom he co-starred with in the 2019 rom-com “A Rainy Day in New York” — were still “cool,” he replied, “Yeah, of course.”
He also gave a firm “no” when asked if Jenner and Gomez have drama. 
The “Kardashians” star has not publicly spoken about the rumored gossip.
