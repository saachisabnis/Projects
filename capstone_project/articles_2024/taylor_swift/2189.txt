At this point, who isn't a Swiftie? Celebrities are big fans as well, and that includes New Hampshire's own Adam Sandler.
Like many fans of Taylor, we span from pre-teen to boomer, from everyday humans like you and I to A-listers and politicians.
What's even more human is when we learn that a massive star like Adam can be nervous around another celebrity.
According to People Magazine, Conan O'Brien spoke with 57-year-old Adam on his Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, and asked him what it's like to meet other big celebrities and if any make him nervous or starstruck. He admitted that Taylor makes him nervous because of his two daughters, Sadie (17) and Sunny (15).
You know what, Taylor Swift, because what she means to my kids, I get a little jumpy. Just cause I don't wanna blow it for my kids. So I'm a little like, 'Taylor, Taylor,' like I talk a little too loud or something. I don't stay as cool as I can.
Adam, along with his wife Jackie, was caught on video with Sunny and Sadie at the premiere of Taylor's Eras Tour film in Los Angeles, getting some one-on-one love from the mega-superstar. Oh to be a fly on the wall and see if Adam lost his coolness factor or not.
According to E! News Online, Taylor showered her love back to the Swiftie family. As you can see in the videos below, there are hugs, selfies, and Adam dancing his heart out with Taylor during the movie.
It looks like Taylor is just as much of an Adam fan, don't you think?  I mean, there she is with Adam as he dances his heart out to one of her most popular songs, "Karma".
Look at Adam DANCE, trademark Hawaiian shirt and all. I love it.
