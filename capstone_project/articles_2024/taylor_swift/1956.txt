Taylor Swift has never met a miniskirt she didn’t immediately want to purchase. Consider the tartan Hill House skirts and heeled Prada loafers; the Versace leather minis and vintage football sweaters; and the tweed Stella McCartney micro-minis and 40 denier tights. It’s all part of the New England prep school uniform that Vogue’s Hayley Maitland described as being “as much of a Swiftian staple as lyrics about kissing and fighting in the rain”.
Earlier this week, Swift was photographed leaving Sydney’s Pellegrino 2000 restaurant in a pleated Miu Miu kilt with a diamond friendship bracelet and a £79 House of CB corset top. Because even despite invoking 2.3 magnitude earthquakes via her fandom and taking 13-minute flights on her private jet, this is a musician who likes to maintain an aspect of down-to-earth-ness – wearing £58 Little Lies dresses while dining with Blake Lively in New York. “She’s dressing for revenge,” as Maitland wrote back in September. “But also chem lab at Manchester Prep.”
Though a certain 2010s Abercrombie and Fitch aesthetic has been percolating on the runways for several seasons – Raimundo Langlois being perhaps the most explicit example of this – the miniskirt is generally on the wane. At London Fashion Week, designers seemed to be favouring a long and languid silhouette, with wispy trains at Conner Ives and Aaron Esh, while the “awkward” skirt length is being mainstreamed by proponents of “corpcore” on TikTok and Instagram. But Swift doesn’t dress to set – or even acknowledge – contemporary trends. She exists outside of fashion: in a kilt skirt and frilly white ankle socks, committed only to her own “I am you, you are me” mall girl iconography.
