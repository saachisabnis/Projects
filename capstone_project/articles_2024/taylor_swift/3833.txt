Jason Kelce has his little brother’s back.
The retired NFL player defended Travis Kelce for chugging a beer during the pair’s impromptu graduation ceremony at the University of Cincinnati earlier this week. 
When a fan on X asked the former Philadelphia Eagles star, 36, to “question” his brother’s “graduation antics,” Jason responded, “I know it looks like a graduation from the video, but this was actually at the end of a ‘New Heights Live’ podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL.” 
He went on, “The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.”
The brothers hosted a live taping of their chart-topping podcast at their alma mater Thursday, and the university surprised the duo by honoring them with their diplomas. 
Complete with caps and gowns, the ceremony came almost two decades after Jason’s freshman year. The eldest Kelce brother attended the college from 2006 to 2010, while Travis was a student from 2008 to 2012. 
The Kansas City Chiefs player, 34, completed his remaining credits to earn an interdisciplinary studies degree in 2022 but didn’t attend his commencement.
Jason, for his part, earned a degree in marketing and didn’t attend his graduation either.

“A surprise commencement we’ll never forget. Congratulations to Travis and Jason on (finally) picking up their diplomas!” the university captioned a post on X. 
Earlier in the night, Travis was seen grooving to his girlfriend, Taylor Swift’s song “Shake It Off.” 
“That’s one of my favorites,” he could be heard telling the audience in a TikTok video posted from the live taping.
Though Swift, 34, didn’t attend the event, fans were surprised by special guests Joe Burrow and Travis’ former Chiefs teammate Orlando Brown Jr. 
The brothers’ parents, Donna and Ed Kelce, along with Jason’s wife, Kylie Kelce, were also seen supporting the athletes at their home-state show.
