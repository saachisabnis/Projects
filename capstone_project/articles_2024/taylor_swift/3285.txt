Azealia Banks has intensified her criticism of Beyoncé, targeting the superstar’s new album Cowboy Carter.
The controversial provocateur took to her Instagram Stories to offer her thoughts on Queen B’s new project, urging her to “find new content.”

“Absolutely not,” she declared after joking that she might have to “eat her words” when it comes to previous criticism of Bey’s turn into the Country curve. “Themes r redundant. The lyrics really are forced. Album is too long… Plus who is this imaginary adversary sis thinks still wants to hump on [JAY-Z] in 2024?
“She’s gotta find new content. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY thinks he’s even remotely attractive …. LOL,” she added before finding positive things to say about the non-vocal aspects the album. “Great work from the band/producers/engineers. Cool and interesting work on the sonics. Might be her first sonically cool attempt at being arty…”

Above all her gripes regarding Cowboy Carter, Banks particularly felt Beyoncé missed an opportunity by not featuring some of country music’s biggest names like Taylor Swift and Kacey Musgraves, among others.
“I personally would have jumped out of my seat for a KT Tunstall appearance,” she continued. “A strong dr. Luke power ballad was missing … like ‘Low’.”

Overall, Banks felt the project was a snooze, noting that she “dozed off again.”

Azealia Banks’ review echoes sentiments she shared earlier this week, when she suggested that the former Destiny’s Child leader is trying to behave like a white woman.
“Sis, I live for Whiteyonce Donatella Bianca Bardot DOWN, but I’m kind of ashamed at how [you] switch from Baobab trees and Black Parade to this literal pick me stuff,” she began.

Azealia then suggested that Beyoncé went above and beyond for the Dixie Chicks (with whom she performed at the CMAs in 2016) because they were white women.
“Like u do lame stuff like bring out some blacklisted white women (Dixie Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. and they would never, ever do the same for you. Ur always sharing ur platform with white women, who are so jealous of you but have such a long history of sabotaging other black careers,” she wrote. “You’re reinforcing the false rhetoric that country music is a post-civil war art form.”

After questioning why Beyoncé would attempt to break into an art form that didn’t make her feel welcomed, Azealia Banks roasted “16 Carriages,” claiming that it “didn’t make any sense.”
“Had you made a great country song … going number one should be the headline without the weird race part,” she concluded. “But like Kelsea Ballerini and Carrie Underwood have better songs than whatever nauseating little Bey on the prairie stuff is going on.”

The project currently under scrutiny by Banks dropped on Friday (March 29).
