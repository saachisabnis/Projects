Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been somewhat low-key this month (they showed up to an Oscars party with a strict no-photo policy), but if you're thirsty for content, look no further than this video from one of Tay's Singapore shows.
What we have here is Taylor closing out her set and noticing Travis waiting for her in the crowd. Basically—and to put it with no chill whatsoever—IT'S ALL JUST VERY SWEET.

While we're here, just FYI that a source recently told Entertainment Tonight this cuteness:
"Travis has never felt more supported by a significant other ever. This is just the beginning for them as a couple and many milestones are coming their way. Taylor and Travis make time for each other because they want to. They both take so much pride in the importance of family and love bringing their families and close-knit circles together. They are genuine, honest, loving and forthright with each other across the board. They both continually encourage one another to be the best that they can be."
Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.
Alexa, play “...Ready for It?”
Correction: screaming!
On top of that, an insider semi-recently told the Daily Mail that, "Taylor’s family and everyone who knows her is so relieved by her relationship with Travis—not only because she is madly in love but also because he makes her security personnel job much easier. [...] Travis is a big dude and no one would mess with him because, when it comes to Taylor, he would not play if someone tried to come near her. She has a built-in bodyguard at all times."
The Tortured Poets Department drops April 19!
"I've never had an album where I needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets."
Okay, this kiiiiinda disputes breakup album theories.
Interesting timing!!!!!

President Donald Trump is being ripped to shreds after he bragged—by all accounts, erroneously—that gas prices had cratered to less than $2 per gallon. “Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years,” Trump wrote on Truth Social this morning, touting the unsourced claim as evidence that the economy was flourishing under his tariffs.
