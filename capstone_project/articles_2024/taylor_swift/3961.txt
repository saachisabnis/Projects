Taylor Swift is known to drop Easter eggs, aka clues about her music, leading up to an album release.
The ticking clock on the singer’s website on Thursday, April 18 — the day before “The Tortured Poets Department” is set to drop — has finally wound down to zero, revealing a secret many Swifties have been waiting for: the album’s lead single.
After a momentary glitch that led the site to crash for a few minutes, the page reloaded and on it was a YouTube Short featuring Swift at her beloved typewriter. The snippet is captioned, “A message for the department,” and goes on to inform Swifties and the “Tay haters” of the world that the first single off TTPD is “Fortnight,” featuring none other than Texas star Post Malone.
The track list for “The Tortured Poets Department” has been out for a minute, meaning fans knew this song existed. Some have even listened to a version of it thanks to the numerous album leaks online. But no one was certain about which song Swift would choose as the lead single. However, that mystery has since been solved. The short video clip also reveals there will be a “For a Fortnight Challenge” on YouTube Shorts starting Friday, April 19 — the day Swift’s 11th album drops.
Over on X, Swift announced the song will be getting the music video treatment, which fans and foes can watch at 8 p.m. ET on Friday, April 19. The. Grammy-winning music artist also took a moment to sing Post Malone’s praises.
The first single from The Tortured Poets Department is…………. Fortnight featuring @postmalone 🤍 I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever. I got to witness that… pic.twitter.com/b6cqrHkbE1
“I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever. I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on Fortnight. Honestly can’t wait for you guys to hear this song at Midnight TONIGHT and see the video at 8 pm ET TOMORROW,” Swift wrote.
Swift’s collaboration with Post Malone has been something fans have been pining for since the “Anti-Hero” singer gave him a bear hug at the 2019 American Music Awards. It seems Swifties’ dreams are becoming a reality.
“The Tortured Poets Department” will be available to stream wherever you get your music at midnight ET on Friday, April 19.
