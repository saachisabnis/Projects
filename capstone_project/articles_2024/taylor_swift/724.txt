When the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs go head to head in this weekend's big game...fans will be watching for more than just touchdowns, they'll be tuning in to watch arguably the most high-profile fan, Taylor Swift.
Swift is the pop sensation, and 12-time Grammy Award-winning music icon, with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion, and she happens to be the girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
Swift has been a frequent fan at Chiefs games since the two started dating this fall.
Over the months they've been nicknamed Swelce, Traylor or Tayvis. Whatever you call them— they bring renewed attention to football among a group of people that might not otherwise watch.
“Taylor Swift has now given even another reason for even more people to watch the thing that the most people are watching anyway,” said Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University.
"I think there's probably also an argument to be made that there are NFL fans, football fans who never listened to Taylor Swift who were not downloading her songs, who were not doing any of this stuff who have now been introduced to Taylor Swift. I have a feeling there sure are Swifties who are now NFL fans, but there are probably NFL fans who are now Swifites, even though they may not admit to that title."
According to Stub Hub, ticket sales for Chiefs home games tripled once Swift came into the picture, while an analysis by Google Trends finds searches for "Where is Kansas City?" more than doubled this fall.
You can catch the Bills play the Kansas City Chiefs in Buffalo Sunday on CBS5. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.
