In case you're looking for signs that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are end game, apparently a) they're obsessed with spending time together, and b) their families are completely on board with their relationship and haven't seen them so happy. Like, ever.
A source tells Entertainment Tonight that Taylor and Travis are "closer than ever before and everyone around them can see that they’re an amazing match."
Obviously these two have been spending a ton of time together lately (Taylor's on break from the Eras Tour until February), and the insider says "They love being together no matter what they’re doing and appreciate the little things in life. They try to lead as normal lives as possible as a couple and are enjoying the upswing and growth in their relationship. They believe that timing is everything and that this is their time."
Taylor and Travis's families spent Christmas together, and they "are both on board and everyone on Travis’ side loves Taylor and vice versa. It’s a supportive dynamic all around. Their loved ones have never seen either of them so happy and hope and believe that it will continue."
FYI that Taylor is expected to show up at the Golden Globes this Sunday (she's nominated for The Eras Tour concert film), but Travis sadly won't be by her side due to a Chiefs game RUDELY scheduled on the same day. As the source put it, "Travis is not expected to attend the Golden Globes due to the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the L.A. Chargers game on Sunday."
Guess we'll have to wait a minute for their first official carpet appearance!
