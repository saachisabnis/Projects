Morgan Wallen is breaking attendance records just like Taylor Swift, and he knows there's no need for any competition between them.
While performing at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana on Friday, April 5, the country music star, 30, broke the attendance record at the stadium and joked on stage that he'll likely hold the record until Swift, 34, brings her Eras Tour to the venue in November. As the crowd reacted to the mention of the pop superstar by booing, Wallen was quick to shut down their negativity.
During the second Indianapolis stop of his One Night at a Time Tour, fans recorded footage of the "Cowgirls" singer revealing that he shattered a record at the 67,000-capacity venue.
Wallen said, "They told me right before I walked on stage that this is the single most-attended concert in the history of this building. And that we're the first people to do it two nights in a row, so thank you for making it possible for making me to say that."

As his statement was followed by boos from the crowd, he replied, "We ain‚Äôt got to boo, we ain‚Äôt got to boo."
"I appreciate that," the "Last Night" singer added. "I know y'all got my back, though."

In the comments of a video of the moment that surfaced on TikTok, a handful of Swifties shared how much it meant to them to see Wallen say something about his audience's reaction. "'we aint got to boo' üòò I love this man!!! üòò," one replied, while another commented, "Greatness recognizing greatness ü§åüèª."
Another self-described Swiftie noted that they're a fan of both artists and appreciated how he stood up for the Grammy winner. "Love Morgan! He will always have a fan in me but a lot of his fans are questionable lol I'm also a Swiftie!! Love to see my fave artists thriving and not drowning each other!"
"I saw Morgan and Taylor two weeks apart at sofi," an addition fan commented, referring to their concerts at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium in summer 2023. "They were both amazing at what they do ü•∞ I love them both!"
After Swift takes her career-spanning tour to Europe in late May for a string of dates that last through the summer, she'll launch the second leg of North American dates in October. The "Karma" singer will play three dates each in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis, then take the live show to Canada in late November and early December for her final concerts of 2024.
