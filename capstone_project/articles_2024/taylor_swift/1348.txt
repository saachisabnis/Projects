NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV/Gray News) – When Taylor Swift moved to Nashville to pursue a music career in the early 2000s, she was starstruck by Toby Keith.
In a TV interview with WSMV in 2005, 15-year-old Swift described her disbelief in being signed to Keith’s record label at the time.
“You’re in the room with him and you can feel it. There’s a power there, and you’re just like, ‘Oh my God,’” Swift told WSMV. “I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I won’t see him and be like, ‘Oh my God, that’s Toby Keith.’”
At the time, Keith had teamed up with Scott Borchetta to form Big Machine Label Group. Taylor Swift was the first artist signed to the label.
Keith died Monday night after a battle with stomach cancer.
The Country Music Hall of Fame and stars like Luke Combs, Jason Aldean and Old Dominion weighed in on Keith’s death, calling him a “trailblazer” who “never backed down.”
“Authentic and heartfelt but always with a wink ‘til the end,” Old Dominion wrote on X. “He was larger than life in so many ways and his music will live on forever! Raising our red solos tonight — you will be missed by so many. Peace.”
Swift has not commented publicly on Keith’s death as of Tuesday morning.
