One Thing at a Time continues to have the most weeks at No. 1 among all albums since Adele’s 21 logged 24 nonconsecutive weeks atop the tally in 2011-12. One Thing at a Time debuted atop the chart dated March 18, 2023, and spent its first 12 weeks at No. 1 through early June. It then logged another three weeks in a row atop the list in late June and early July, and nabbed its 16th week in charge on the Oct. 14 chart. In the album’s 45 weeks on the list, it has never dipped below No. 6. One Thing at a Time finished 2023 as both the No. 1 year-end Billboard 200 album and Luminate’s year-end top album.

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Jan. 20, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Jan. 17 (a day later than usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in the U.S. on Jan. 15).
