Super Bowl weekend is a busy time for Monical's Pizza, which is taking pizza pre-orders and also expects to sell a great deal of take-home frozen pizzas.
CLINTON ‚Äî Just like the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, Central Illinois restaurants and grocery stores are busy prepping for the big game this weekend.
Donnie Chapman, the manager of Clinton IGA, said the deli department typically takes preorders for large orders of chicken.
He expected the store to be "really" busy on Saturday and Sunday morning, especially in the meat department, which was already preparing chicken wings and other items by Friday afternoon.
"(It's) mainly making sure we have plenty of snacks and relish trays and stuff like that, beverages, deli fried chicken. It will be a busy one," Chapman said. "We welcome and (are) glad to see everybody come in."
LeAnn Bochez, from the meat department at the Lincoln IGA, said she mostly takes preorder from local places hosting fundraisers and events while most of the catering for holidays goes through the deli department.
Some hot-ticket items include fried chicken, meat trays, veggie trays and chili.
"A lot of the things we're getting ready are meat for grilling, pork; a lot of people asking about rib-eyes," she said. "Mainly the wings, the chicken ‚Äî we sell a lot of the family packs of wings. We expect to be (busy) leading up to Sunday."
She added that she doesn't watch football, but she has noticed a lot of people, especially older gentlemen, wearing jerseys and talking about the big game while in the store.
One of the managers at Monical's Pizza in Clinton, Matthew Jenkins, said they haven't received a lot of preorders ahead of the game, but he expects them to come in as the weekend progresses.
He said the restaurant is often busy up until halfway through the first quarter as the last batch of people are often picking up their food, but then around halftime, it usually settles down.
"We often sell a lot of our frozen, take-home pizzas, so we have been building those up for a while to make sure we have enough for everybody," Jenkins said. "Beyond that, it's just a little extra prep to make sure we have enough of everything to get through the weekend."
He said he doesn't think there are a whole lot of NFL fans in the area for either side but believes the focus on Taylor Swift has increased public interest.
