The Tri-State's Best Talk
Normally you'd get in trouble for throwing paint all over a room, but at this art studio in Owensboro, KY you're encouraged to make a mess and a masterpiece!
We LOVE making arts and crafts at our house. Our dining room is basically an art studio with paint tubes canvases hanging on the walls and every supply you can think of organized (well, we try our best) into containers and boxes. We don't stress too much about the mess if we are making memories and being creative, but I think I would have to draw the line if my 9-year-old son wanted to throw paint around in there.
Luckily, there is a place in town called Hammer & Stain Owensboro located at 2845 W. Parrish Ave. where you can let your kiddo, or yourself for that matter, go wild with creativity.
The Splatter Den is a room where you can put on a poncho and some goggles, hang a canvas of your choice onto the wall, and literally throw paint at it. Channel your inner Jackson Pollock for a unique date night or even host a birthday party with kiddos taking turns making works of art and having a blast.I saw on their Facebook page that they can make decals of different sports or video game controllers or unicorns or spell a name that sticks on the canvas before the paint tossing begins. When the artist has splattered to their heart's content, the decal is removed to reveal the cool design.
I love that with this kind of birthday party, each kid gets to take home their own creation as a party favor. And where else can you have fun just going wild and making a mess? So cool! They also have lots of other projects you can work on like door hangers, ceramics, porch planters, and Taylor Swift-themed canvases. Great for girls' night.
Happy painting!
