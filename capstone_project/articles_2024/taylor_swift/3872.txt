Sorry... The old iHeartRadio can't come to the phone right now. Why? Because we're rebranding as iHeartTaylor this Friday, April 19th. It's all part of our Taylor Swift Week celebration. 
The wait is FINALLY over. Swifties are getting Taylor Swift's newest album, The Tortured Poets Department. To celebrate the long-awaited album release, this week is officially Taylor Swift Week on iHeartRadio! iHeartRadio, soon-to-be iHeartTaylor, knows our Swiftie fans "All Too Well" and we have some exciting opportunities for everyone to prepare for Friday's release. 
Be sure to check out the free iHeartRadio app on Friday because as part of Taylor Swift Week, it'll be rebranded as iHeartTaylor. Open the app to see just how iHeartRadio turned into iHeartTaylor.
This Thursday, iHeartRadio stations across the U.S. are preparing everyone for The Tortured Poets Department by playing "Taylor Swift Mini Mixes," which will highlight some of her biggest hits throughout the years. 
Us pathological people pleasers couldn't leave fans with just mini mixes... Thursday will also see "Twice The Taylor," where stations will feature the Fearless singer's hits spanning across her entire career! 
Meet us at midnight to kickoff iHeartRadio's Album Premiere with Taylor Swift. Our stations will be playing The Tortured Poets Department in its entirety as well as sharing exclusive audio from Taylor herself at 12 a.m. ET/ 9 p.m. PT! You can tune in to your local iHeartRadio station or on the iHeartRadio app to listen to the highly anticipated album.
