Taylor Swift has just finished a sold-out run of her record-breaking Eras Tour across the United States, South America, Mexico, Australia and Asia and is taking a nearly two-month hiatus.
Swift, 34, has had a phenomenal year since she started the tour last March. It became the highest-grossing live music tour long before it hit the halfway point of its 152 shows worldwide.
The tour is set to conclude in December 2024. It's seen unprecedented demand and has made over $1 billion‚Äîbreaking the record for the highest-grossing tour of all time, according to Guinness World Records.
The tour's last concert was a sold-out show at the 55,000-seat National Stadium in Singapore on March 9. She is taking the extended break before her next concert, which will be in Paris in May.
"We got to play 6 shows in Singapore for the most wonderful crowds ‚Äî just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who traveled and put so much effort into being at our shows," Swift wrote on Instagram on March 10.
"What an unforgettable way to end this leg of the tour!! See you in May when we get back to the Eras Tour!! In the meantime, I've got an album to release," she said.
The pop superstar will debut her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19 during her break. At this year's Grammys, Swift announced she would be releasing the album while accepting the award for best pop vocal performance, her 13th Grammy. She also said she had been recording the album in secret.
Swift's well-deserved downtime will end when she flies to France for the first show of the tour's next leg. The European shows commence at Paris' La D√©fense Arena on May 9, where they will run until May 12.

After her final show in Paris, Swift will head to other European countries, including Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Germany. She will also perform shows in England.
After completing the European leg of her tour in the middle of August, she will make a few last-minute appearances in American cities, including Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis. She's scheduled to end her tour in Canada, with multiple shows in November and December. The tour is expected to conclude on December 8 in Vancouver, five days before her 35th birthday on December 13.
Newsweek emailed a Swift representative for comment.
Last July, Swift started dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, with the couple going public with their relationship in September. The Chiefs, who won this year's Super Bowl, will start training camp in the summer.
The camp will start on July 23 and run until August 17, with only six days off in that period. This means Kelce will be busy while Swift is on the road.
