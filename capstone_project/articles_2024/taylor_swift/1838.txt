That seems very likely, as Liu, Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are all nominated at the PCAs for their roles in Greta Gerwig's critically acclaimed film. (See the full list of 2024 nominees here.)
But would Liu ever join Gosling on stage at this year's Academy Awards for a performance of his Oscar-nominated Best Original Song "I'm Just Ken"?

"I'm in," the 34-year-old told E!. "He's my guy. He's an incredible singer. He's got a voice, he can hit the notes. I think the Academy would be stupid not to invite him."
Another multi-nominated performer at this year's ceremony? Taylor Swift.
But, unfortunately, Liu says fans shouldn't get their hopes up when it comes to seeing the Grammy-winning star at the show.
"We're a big Swiftie household," he shared, adding of the "Eras" singer, "the thing is Taylor will be on tour at that time. She's off to Australia for the next leg of her tour and then she's got to do four shows there. So, we're not expecting it, but what an incredible year for her."
See if Liu, Swift and more stars win top categories when the 2024 People's Choice Awards air Feb. 18 at 8 p.m. on NBC, E! and Peacock.
