The mural also has various letters, which appear to be "T," "P" and "D," and the number 13 displayed on it.
The mural did not appear to be completed Tuesday afternoon, and scaffolding was blocking it partially.
The QR code takes fans to a short on Swift's YouTube account, which reads "Error 321."
Swift is known for unveiling cryptic messages and Easter eggs leading up to her album and music video releases.
Several were gathered near the building about noon Tuesday, trying to scan the code and decipher the message.
