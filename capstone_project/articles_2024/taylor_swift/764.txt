Leave it to Buffalo, New York. A Buffalo Bills player and his wife welcomed a brand new baby and needed a little help. Everyone knows that if you are looking for help, all you have to do it ask.
And the Bills Mafia came running.
It took 3 hours and an hour and a half, but the new family is now home!
Mitch Morse was on the Pat McAfee Show yesterday and talked about the City of Buffalo just embracing the snow, how much it snows and told the story of one of the players needing help from the Bills Mafia.
David Edwards, a new guard that was signed to the Buffalo Bills from free agency, needed help getting to the hospital and back home during the snow storm. Dennis Miller of Miller's collision gave Edwards a front-loader escort.
