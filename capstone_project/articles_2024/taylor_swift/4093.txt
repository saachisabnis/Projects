It's not new that people are upset with Taylor Swift. We hear it all the time:
First of all, if that sounds like someone you know, block them. On your phone. On social media. From your life. You don't need that kind of negativity in 2024.
Second, why are these grown men so upset at Taylor Swift? Honest question. How is it that, as a grown human adult, your biggest problem is life is a music artist you don't care for very much? If too much Taylor Swift is the single largest issue you're facing in life right now, consider yourself very lucky.
Where did it all start? Probably years ago, but all signs point to the NFL going all-in on Taylor Swift during their most recent season. Don't believe us? Just look at the plethora of shots of Taylor at the 2024 Super Bowl. Yes, she was there supporting her boyfriend Travis Kelce, but some fans believe that the entire game focused solely on Taylor.
