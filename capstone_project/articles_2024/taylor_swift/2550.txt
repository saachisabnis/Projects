Taylor Swift sees a lot of long-term potential in Travis Kelce, her boyfriend of less than year, a source told Entertainment Tonight.
The insider shared that Swift really does like not having to hide her relationship after years of dating other partners, like Joe Alwyn, very privately. While Kelce engagement reports were shut down by sources earlier this year, there seems to be a real possibility Swift would say yes if Kelce proposed someday.
“Taylor views Travis as a true partner and someone she can have a real future with,” Entertainment Tonight’s source said.
Swift is “happier than ever and so in love,” they added. “She likes that Travis is so proud of her and that he isn't afraid to show his love for her publicly.”
Swift is “in a great place and having the best time performing, making music, and feeling free to live her life more openly,” the source said. “Travis is enjoying being on tour with Taylor and is happy to support her.” (Swift’s last long-term partner Alwyn did not attend any Eras tour shows. Their 6-year relationship ended shortly after her tour started.)
Swift herself spoke in December to Time about being in a public versus private relationship. “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him [Kelce] do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she said. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”
She also shared why she has decided to go out as she pleases, even though her A-list fame will always get her attention. “Over the years, I’ve learned I don’t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter,” she said. “Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.”
“Life is short,” she continued. “Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years—I’ll never get that time back. I’m more trusting now than I was six years ago.”
