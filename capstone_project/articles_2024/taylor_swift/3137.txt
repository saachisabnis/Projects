Taylor Swift’s father will not face police charges after he was accused of punching a photographer during his superstar daughter's Australian tour.
Photographer Ben McDonald told police Scott Swift struck him in the face at Neutral Bay Wharf in Sydney on February 27, hours after his daughter’s Australian tour had ended.
Following a month-long investigation, New South Wales police have confirmed no further action would be taken.
A statement given to the PA news agency said: “Officers attached to North Shore Police Area Command have conducted an investigation following a report of an assault at Neutral Bay Wharf about 2.30am on Tuesday, February 27.
“No further police action.”
The alleged confrontation happened after Mr Swift and his daughter left a yacht, in the hours after the final of her four Eras Tour dates in Sydney.
At the time, Taylor Swift’s representative accused members of the media of behaving “aggressively” towards the megastar during the interaction.
Veteran photographer Mr McDonald described the incident at the time as a “punch in the chops” that “didn’t require medical assistance.”
