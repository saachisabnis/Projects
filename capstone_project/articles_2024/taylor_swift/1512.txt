Flavor Flav has revealed what he discussed with Taylor Swift during their encounter at the 2024 Grammy Awards.
The Public Enemy star, a self-confessed Swiftie, has opened up about their conversation at the annual music awards show on Sunday. At the NFL Honors event in Las Vegas, he told reporters he finally “got to get some Taylor time.”
“The discussion (at the event) was about me congratulating her on all her success. And me being a big fan of hers, a big supporter of hers,” Flavor Flav said on the red carpet.
“Having her acknowledge that her fan base, Swifties, gave me a name, ‘King Swiftie,'” he added. “I said, ‘You know they call me King Swiftie?’ 
She said, ‘I know!’ Yo, when I heard her say that, that was huge for me.”
Flavor Flav, 64, first met Taylor Swift at the iHeartRadio Awards in March 2023. He subsequently attended two of her shows in Detroit and Los Angeles in the summer and went to the premiere of her concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” in October.
