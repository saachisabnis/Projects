Patrick Mahomes has insisted his NFL football teammate Travis Kelce “hasn’t been any different” following his newfound fame.
The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback has told how the tight end, who has recently gained more media and fan attention away from the NFL after he started dating superstar singer Taylor Swift, has “been himself the whole time.”
“Travis has always been Travis. It’s been cool to watch for me because he has all that attention but he’s just been himself the whole time,” Mahomes said speaking at a press conference ahead of the Chiefs’ AFC Championship Game against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024.
Mahomes insisted his pal Kelce still treats everyone at the Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium as if they’re his “best friend.”
“He’s still Travis Kelce. He still will walk through the stadium and treat every single person like they’re his best friend. And he’s going to be like that in the locker room every single day. It hasn’t been any different,” he said.
One part of Kelce’s newfound fame saw him present at “Saturday Night Live,” and Mahomes admitted that the SNL gig has “always been a dream” of his teammate.
“It was really, really cool. It was a dream of his. He knows all the skits from guys that were on ‘Saturday Night Live.’ He was telling me the ones from before I was even born. I was like, Trav, I’m not the same age as you, I don’t even know who that is,'” Mahomes added.
If the Chiefs defeat the Ravens this upcoming weekend, they will confirm their place at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, where they will face either the San Francisco 49ers or the Detroit Lions.
