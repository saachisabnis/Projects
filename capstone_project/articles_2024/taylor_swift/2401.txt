National Women's History Month is a perfect time to remind us all that since 2022, the United States Mint has been making quarters with women on them. It's all part of the American Women Quarters Program that celebrates the contributions made by women in a domain that's always been dominated by all men.
Well, let me backtrack briefly. According to the Fast Company website, the first time a woman appeared on a coin was in 1979 with the Susan B. Anthony Dollar. The Sacagawea Golden Dollar Coin followed 21 years later in 2000 and Helen Keller appeared on Alabama’s state quarter in 2003.
If you just sift through your wallet, the bottom of your handbag, or change even your bowl you're sure to find some of these quarters. You can also buy them on the US Mint website.
Before I introduce you to the women of 2024 here's a reminder of the women already in circulation.
Now for 2024, thank you, and welcome to the American Women Quarters Program.
For an encore, these are the women we're honoring in 2025 which sadly, is the last year of the program unless something changes.
