Brittany Mahomes has received her fair share of criticism throughout the years, with fans calling her “annoying,” “intolerable,” and much more — especially after an incident where she showered fans with champagne in the freezing cold.
But now, a server who recently waited on Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ high school sweetheart is also detailing an experience with Mrs. Mahomes in person that left a bad taste in her mouth.
A former employee of the 1 Hotel West Hollywood, Jessica O’Connor, took to TikTok to put Brittany on blast and said that she waited on Mahomes and her posse.
During her interactions with Mrs. Mahomes, O’Connor says that Mahomes was “genuinely unpleasant” and then ripped fer for failing to leave a tip after racking up a $130 bill.
Now, this is the internet, so you can’t always believe what people say, but this story doesn’t seem too far-fetched.
After all, Brittany is flying high as one of Taylor Swift’s new BFFs, so she probably feels like she’s even more entitled to whatever she wants than before.
