Imagine you’re an offensive lineman and Taylor Swift bakes you a batch of homemade pop-tarts. That’s not a sugary dream, folks – it happened in the real world. According to Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid, Swift is in her “baking era,” handing out pastry delights to the team – though she may have forgotten to save one for him. The coach shared the anecdote with humor and admiration at the NFL Scouting Combine, noting that Taylor is super down-to-earth despite possibly being “the most famous woman in the world” post-Queen Elizabeth.
Beyond the realm of baked goods, Taylor and her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have carved out their sweet spot in the NFL spotlight. Swift, who’s got a history of being the sideline cinnamon roll queen, seems to enjoy the gritty gridiron as her new playground. Clearly, Andy Reid is all for it, applauding how both Kelce and Swift handle the media’s glare with ease. Pop-tart generosity aside, it seems the real treat for the team is having Taylor on their cheer squad.
