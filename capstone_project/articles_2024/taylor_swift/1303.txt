Late last night, around 12:46am on February 6th, 2024, Boise Fire responded to a distress call reporting a large playground fire at the 5000 block of N. Eugene St., according to a release from the Boise Police Department. Castle Hills Park bore the brunt of the blaze, resulting in a complete loss of playground equipment. Boise City Fire Investigators have determined that the fire was started intentionally.
Boise Police Officers were called to the scene around 1:30am to launch an arson investigation. Detectives are diligently scouring the area for additional evidence and examining surveillance footage in hopes of identifying the perpetrator.
Expressing disappointment, Boise Parks and Recreation Director Doug Holloway stated, "This is a very disappointing situation, and we are working closely with Boise Police, Boise Fire, and the city’s Risk and Safety team on next steps." While the playground is insured, the estimated cleanup and replacement costs are anticipated to reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The community can expect updates from Boise Parks and Recreation regarding the timeline for replacing the Castle Hills Park playground as the investigation unfolds.
