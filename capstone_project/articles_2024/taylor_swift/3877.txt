Courtney Love is not afraid to speak her mind or start beef with big artists, and ironically enough she most recently set her sights on some of the most famous female singers during an interview with The Standard where she was promoting a new BBC Radio 6 series that's meant to uplift and empower women in music. Her first victim was Taylor Swift.
“Taylor is not important. She might be a safe space for girls, and she’s probably the Madonna of now, but she’s not interesting as an artist," the former Hole frontwoman said.
Then she went for Lana Del Rey—an artist that Love previously called one of the only "true musical geniuses" she's ever known. “I haven’t liked Lana since she covered a John Denver song, and I think she should really take seven years off,” she confesed. “Up until ‘Take Me Home, Country Roads’ I thought she was great. When I was recording my new album, I had to stop listening to her as she was influencing me too much.”
Next up: Madonna. “I don’t like her and she doesn’t like me," Love said. "I loved Desperately Seeking Susan, but for the city of New York as much as her.”
She also gave her honest thoughts on Beyoncé's new country album Cowboy Carter. “I like the idea of Beyoncé doing a country record because it’s about Black women going into spaces where previously only white women have been allowed, not that I like it much. As a concept, I love it. I just don’t like her music.”
