Guests will be treated to free cowboy hats and Cornhole, a game where players attempt to get a beanbag through a hole on a ramp which has grown in popularity at bars across North America thanks to TikTok.
On the night, revellers can expect to grapevine and scoot it out to hits from across the genre as the Kickin' It Country DJs play hits from the likes of Dolly Parton and Shania Twain.
However, fans of modern country shouldn't be disappointed as they will also be treated to hits from the likes of Taylor Swift and Luke Combs.
Attendees are asked to dress to impress with cowboy boots and flannel shirts encouraged.
Tickets go on sale on Tuesday 27th February at 10am with an early bird price of £8 or £10 general admission. 
For ticket information, keep an eye on the Kickin' It Country Facebook.
