Social media users quickly shut down claims that Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce "revolutionized" the fade haircut. 
Last week, a human-interest piece published in the New York Times explored how men across the county are seeking the "Travis Kelce Cut" amid his skyrocketing popularity. The article, written by Alyson Krueger, failed to mention how the "Travis Kelce Cut" is simply a basic fade that's been administered and worn by Black barbers and men for decades. 
The tight end's celebrity barber, Patrick "Patty Cuts" Regan has also garnered attention for performing the "Kelce Cut" for roughly $1000 a head. According to a New York Post profile about Regan, who also reportedly cuts Diddy's hair, the fade is "taking barber shops by storm."
The reports on the "Kelce Cut" also come amid an article that explained "Swag Surfin" after Grammy award-winning artist Taylor Swift, Kelce's girlfriend, was seen dancing to the song at a Chiefs game.
Many social media users called out the reporting for whitewashing Black history.
"Yet another example of why newsrooms need to do better at hiring and promoting black journalists," one user tweeted. "Any black barber will tell you Travis Kelce’s haircut is not breaking news…. it’s…….. A fade."
"First white people called swag surfing 'the chiefs victory dance' now they’re calling a fade 'the Travis kelce haircut'…." another user pointed out.
"Gentrifying a “Fade” to the “Travis Kelce haircut” is NOT happening during black history month in the year 2024. WTF is happening here?!?" a third said.
