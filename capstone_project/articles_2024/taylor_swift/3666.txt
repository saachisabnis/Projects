(WJAR)  — Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha announced that six people were charged relating to targeting children for sex.
Authorities said the arrests and charges stem from a joint investigation by the Homeland Security Investigation, Warwick Police Department, Rhode Island State Police and the attorney general’s office.
Warwick police and state police arrested six people following an undercover operation last Friday and Saturday, according to officials.
The attorney general’s office said the operation was aimed at finding people using websites and online platforms to meet and engage with minors for sexual activity.
Authorities said they placed fake advertisements on websites known to be associated with prostitution and commercial sex.
The six people responded to a location with the intent to engage in sexual activity with a minor, according to officials.
“The results of this highly effective joint operation send a swift and clear message: those who wish to exploit and endanger children will be met by a powerful coalition of law enforcement partners to prevent that from happening,” said Neronha.
The attorney general’s office said the following people were charged:
“The operation that took place April 4th and 5th is a great example of agency cooperation and skilled investigators working together to root out child sexual predators,” Warwick Police Chief Colonel Bradford E. Connor said. “Those arrested are a stark reminder that there are people out there who will continue to victimize our most vulnerable children and it emphasizes the need to continue working collaboratively to address this ongoing issue.”
