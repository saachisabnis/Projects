From divorce drama to their red carpet debut, here’s what we know.
It’s been a year of pretty high-profile celebrity romances, but one of the couples who have remained relatively low-key? Oh, that’d be Sophia Bush and United States Women’s National Soccer player Ashlyn Harris. Rumors began swirling when the pair was spotted hanging out at several events throughout 2023, and fans took no time to spiral over their exact relationship timeline—especially because both stars had recently separated from their respective partners.
ICYMI, the One Tree Hill alum was married to FocusMotion Health entrepreneur Grant Hughes for 13 months before they filed for divorce in August 2023. In October of that same year, Ashlyn filed for divorce from fellow soccer star Ali Krieger after four years of marriage. They share two kids and had been together since 2010. But when exactly did Sophia and Ashlyn spark romance rumors? Here’s what we know so far. 🧐
According to Page Six, multiple sources alleged that Sophia and Ashlyn felt a spark after they both served as panelists during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in June. Sophia posted a snap from the event, writing in part, “Love you @ashlynharris24 and @sophieannkelly.”
Sophia and Ashlyn were both in attendance at GQ x Evian’s private lunch at Wimbledon in London.
And according to this video from the event, they were all laughs:
Ashlyn and Sophia were photographed hanging out at La Copa Mundial Femenina de la FIFA Peacock Watch Party in July 2023:
According to a report by People, Sophia filed for divorce from Grant Hughes after being married for 13 months. An anonymous source close to the former couple told the outlet, “Sophia and Grant were friends for 10 years and bonded during COVID through their love of community service. They continue to run their nonprofit together and remain good friends.”
Another source told Entertainment Tonight, “Grant and Sophia are better off as friends and they weren’t getting enough time with each other before their breakup. It wasn’t ugly and they are still supporting each other, want each other to be happy, and for their nonprofit to continue to thrive.”
News broke that Ashlyn and Ali Krieger filed for divorce after four years of marriage. The pair shares two children together, Ocean and Sloane, and according to one of People’s insiders, they had been separated for months. 
“Although it’s new information to the public, Ashlyn and Ali’s divorce began months ago and they have been living apart since the summer,” the insider shared.
Not even a week after Ashlyn’s divorce was made public, another report that she and Sophia went on a first date dropped and pretty much sent the internet into a frenzy. Per People, an insider revealed that “there is no salacious story” when it comes to the timing of Sophia and Ashlyn’s new romance. “After being friends for years and running in the same social circles, Sophia and Ashlyn went out on their first dinner date a couple of weeks ago,” the source said. “This is so recent, and they are both beginning new chapters.”
Another source also told Entertainment Tonight, “Sophia and Ashlyn are dating and are into each other. Although it’s new, the two are on the same page and talk about their future together.”
A rep for Grant entered the chat, telling People, “Grant will always want the best for Sophia and is supportive of all that makes her happy and fulfilled.” 👀
Ali posted a snap as she prepared for playoffs, including a reference to Beyoncé’s Lemonade. “Preparing for playoffs while in my Beyoncé lemonade era,” she wrote. 
According to Just Jared, Ali’s brother, Kyle, also left some comments that raised eyebrows:
He also reportedly referenced Bey’s “Don’t Hurt Yourself” lyrics: “This is your final warning, you know I give you life. If you try this shit again, you gone lose your wife.”
A new report from Page Six gave more details on Sophia and Ashlyn’s Wimbledon outing back in July, revealing that “the duo actually arrived at the bash together.” An anonymous source said that while there was “no PDA...it was clear that Ashlyn and Sophia were cozy together.” 
In November 2023, a Reddit user on the FauxMoi subreddit revealed that Sophia had allegedly saved a fan-made “thirst” edit of Ashlyn on TikTok in June. “Props to this TikToker for having receipts—Sophia Bush saved this thirst Tik-Tok video of Ashlyn back in late June—MONTHS before Ashlyn Harris filed for divorce. Another side eye to their whole timeline,” the user wrote.
An eagle-eyed fan spotted the pair at Mariah Carey’s Merry Christmas One and All tour stop at the Hollywood Bowl in L.A.
Ashlyn released none other than a ~Notes App~ statement on her Instagram. 
According to fans, she allegedly removed “Proud Mom” from her Instagram bio, but it still remains:
Just Jared reported that Ashlyn and Sophia attended Art Basel in Miami Beach on December 7 and posed for a photo together with art dealer Michelle Tillou at an art exhibit.
Sophia posted an emotional Instagram carousel to ring in the new year with a cryptic, lengthy caption.
“This past year humbled me, broke me, built me, betrayed me, freed me, and showed me what it means to really be alive. No more playing small,” she wrote, in part. “This year put me back in my body. I left it a long time ago, in such a way that I forgot what it felt like to inhabit my own skin.”
A source told Us Weekly that Ashlyn and Sophia cozied up to each other while they were “together drinking and dancing” at the season 3 premiere of Netflix’s Girls5Eva in New York City. They also hit up the after-party, where they hung out with Sophia’s former One Tree Hill costar Hilarie Burton. The source claimed they spent “most of the after-party” in the “back booth” of the bar.
“Ashlyn was holding Sophia and kissing her cheek as they danced,” the eyewitness dished, adding that they “seemed in their element” and that Sophia was “beaming all night.” 
Sophia and Ashlyn made their first public appearance together as a couple on Oscars Sunday. The pair attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation’s annual Oscars viewing party and separately posed for photographers. 
The event marks the first time they posed together as they also snapped pics with Eric McCormack, Stephanie Nguyen, and Queer Eye’s Bobby Berk:
Sophia and Ashlyn were some of the guests who celebrated Ruby Rose’s birthday at the Magic Castle in LA on March 21. According to sources, they “came together and were very sweet” and even packed on some PDA. “They were very affectionate and shared kisses throughout the night,” an insider told People and Page Six. “They seem very, very happy.”
Sophia opened up about her split from Grant Hughes and the beginning of her relationship with Ashlyn in a profile with Glamour. “As I came into myself, I already felt it was my home. I think I’ve always known that my sexuality exists on a spectrum,” the actor revealed in the self-written cover story before adding, “Right now, I think the word that best defines it is queer. I can’t say it without smiling, actually. And that feels pretty great.”
And when it comes to the rumors that she left Grant for Ashlyn? “The idea that I left my marriage based on some hysterical rendezvous—that, to be crystal-clear, never happened—rather than having taken over a year to do the most soul crushing work of my life? It feels brutal. Just because I didn’t want to process my realizations in real time on social media and spell them out for the world doesn’t mean the journey wasn’t long and thoughtful and exhaustive,” the One Tree Hill alum penned.
Sophia also gave some insight into the meeting that sparked her romance with the former soccer player. 🥺❤️ “It took me confronting a lot of things, what felt like countless sessions of therapy, and some prodding from loved ones, but eventually, I asked Ashlyn to have a non-friend-group hang to talk about it,” she recalled. “And that meal was four and a half hours long and truly one of the most surreal experiences of my life thus far. In hindsight, maybe it all had to happen slowly and then suddenly all at once. Maybe it was all fated. Maybe it really is a version of invisible string theory.”
These days, the celeb is reveling in her newfound happiness, which she says she’s never felt before: “I finally feel like I can breathe. I am so lucky to be here now. I have real joy. It took me 41 years to get here.”
We’re not crying, you are!!!
