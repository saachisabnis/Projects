A lot can change in four years. Paloma Faith’s sixth album ‘The Glorification of Sadness’ offers quite the contrast to ‘Infinite Things’, flipping that record’s focus on all-consuming love to something closer to triumph despite heartbreak. What we have here is “a divorce album without the divorce” as the chart-topping singer-songwriter leans heavily on her work following a turbulent split with her long-term partner.
Assembled alongside a star-studded production team including Chase & Status, Jack & Coke (Rita Ora, Charli XCX) and TommyD (Kylie Minogue, Beyoncé) there is a lot of potential here for a tear-stained banger-fest. It just doesn’t quite materialise despite an exorbitant 17-strong tracklist. 
Things begin promisingly with the opening track Sweatpants, a heartfelt, emotional ballad lit up by some welcome, semi-regular electro thumps that add extra oomph to an already great number.
Bad Woman and the defiant Already Broken are also surefire hits, with the latter ending the LP on an ultimate high, while How You Leave a Man provides an undeniable sense of euphoria and relief at the break-up.
Elsewhere, the quality control is just a little off. Kojey Radical drops in for Pressure, lending verses to a hip hop foray that’s not particularly memorable. God in a Dress is also something of a snoozefest, wasting lyrics that are genuinely impactful and powerful. “I am a woman / A dangerous, powerful woman / Carry the weight of the world on my chest / What you got? I’m a God in a dress,” Faith belts during the chorus. 
Cry on the Dance Floor is a desperate attempt at a pop banger and, as time rolls on, there are simply too many drab filler tracks to contend with. Given its backstory ‘The Glorification of Sadness’ could have been perfect, but its massive highs are grounded by a whole that’s too long and too frequently lacklustre.
