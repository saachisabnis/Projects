Luke Bryan is sharing his thoughts on Beyoncé getting shut out of the 2024 CMA Awards for Cowboy Carter.
While appearing on Wednesday's episode of Andy Cohen Live, the country star -- who is one of three hosts for next month's awards ceremony -- reacted to Beyoncé receiving zero nominations for Cowboy Carter, despite the success of the country album.
"I mean, it's a tricky question because, obviously, Beyoncé made a country album, and Beyoncé has a lot of fans out there that have her back, and if she doesn't get something they want, man, they come at you ... as fans should do," said Bryan, 45.
"It's a tough thing to say. I don't know how many albums did she sell. I know she had one song," he continued, seemingly referring to "Texas Hold 'Em," one of the two co-lead singles from Cowboy Carter.
The hit topped the Billboard Hot 100 and debuted at No.1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, with Beyoncé making history as the first Black woman to have a No.1 country track on the Billboard charts.
"I mean listen, I'm all for everybody coming in and making country albums and all that," Bryan told Cohen. "But just by declaring that, just because she made one ... just 'cause I make one. I don't get any nominations."
