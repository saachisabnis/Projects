Is a Beyoncé x Levi’s collaboration in the works?! Levi’s just set the internet ablaze with a cryptic social media post captioned “Introducing a new chapter,” featuring the silhouette of a woman riding a cowboy. Naturally, the Beyhive is buzzing, especially after Adidas cut ties with Beyoncé’s Ivy Park line.
Right now, Beyoncé has her entrepreneurial hands full, between her new haircare line and her top-selling whiskey brand, Sirdavis. And let’s not forget the latest track, “Levi’s Jeans,” from her “Cowboy Carter” album, a collab with Post Malone. Rumor has it that Levi’s has seen a sales boost ever since Bey dropped that track, with store visits up 20% around Easter, according to data from Pass_by. Levi’s, of course, is keeping mum about how much of that boost is due to Queen Bey’s influence, but come on—when Beyoncé names a song after your brand, you know it’s a game-changer.

This wouldn’t be her first rodeo in fashion, either. Remember House of Dereon? Beyoncé’s always had her sights set on style, and a Levi’s collab could be her next big move. Stay tuned—this could be denim gold.
