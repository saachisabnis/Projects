President Joe Biden will host President-elect Donald Trump for a traditional post-election meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said Saturday.
Republican leaders are projecting confidence that they will keep control of the US House as more races were decided in their favor Thursday, while Democrats insist they still see a path toward the majority and sought assurances every vote will be counted.
Votes are still being counted in the presidential race, with two states left to be called for either Trump or Kamala Harris.

After Trump swept to power in a decisive win over Harris and Republican candidates picked up enough seats to retake control of the Senate, still outstanding is control of the House of Representatives.
And the stakes are high: The remaining contests will determine whether Trump will retake the White House fortified by control of both chambers, or if the House will flip to Democratic hands and become a barrier to Trump and the Republican agenda.
Here’s are the key races that will determine which party controls the chamber and a live look at where they stand.

President-elect Donald Trump says that Tom Homan, his former acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as “border czar” in his incoming administration.
Homan was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border and Trump’s pledge to launch the largest deportation operation in the country’s history.

In addition to overseeing the southern and northern borders and “maritime, and aviation security,” Trump said Homan “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,” a central part of his agenda.

President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk moved to make demands of the next Senate Republican leader, potentially scrambling a race that has been expected to go to one of Mitch McConnell’s longtime allies.
Trump insisted the next Republican leader endorse letting him make recess appointments bypassing the Senate, which Musk quickly said was essential to accomplishing Trump’s agenda.

Musk then endorsed Florida Senator Rick Scott, a longtime Trump ally and McConnell critic, for the leader job, after Scott backed Trump’s demand. Musk also has posted a poll asking his followers who should replace McConnell, who isn’t running for another term atop the GOP in Wednesday’s secret-ballot election.
The New York Times
Senators vying to become the next leader of the Republican conference pledged on Sunday to quickly push through President-elect Donald Trump’s appointees after he demanded on social media that they do so.
Sen. Rick Scott of Florida was the first to make such a vow in an attempt to curry favor with Trump. Scott quickly picked up the endorsement of one of the president-elect’s biggest backers, billionaire Elon Musk.
Not to be outdone, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is considered a front-runner in the race, released a statement saying that he, too, would push to swiftly staff Trump’s administration.
“One thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s Cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we’ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,” Thune said.

Sen. John Cornyn of Texas was not far behind.
“It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump’s cabinet appointments,” he wrote on social media. “If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments.”

President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, the first phone conversation between the two men since Trump won the election, said several people familiar with the matter.
During the call, which Trump took from his resort in Florida, he advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of Washington’s sizable military presence in Europe, said a person familiar with the call, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.
The two men discussed the goal of peace on the European continent and Trump expressed an interest in follow-up conversations to discuss “the resolution of Ukraine’s war soon,” several of the people said.

Bill Burr didn’t hold back in his “Saturday Night Live” monologue during the show’s first episode following Donald Trump’s election victory.
The Canton comic, who previously hosted the show in 2020, returned to New York’s Studio 8H Saturday night, with singer-songwriter Mk.gee serving as the evening’s musical guest. Burr reacted to Tuesday’s election results in his monologue, saying, “Alright ladies, you’re 0-2 against this guy.”

Donald Trump has said he wouldn’t be a dictator — “except for Day 1.” According to his own statements, he’s got a lot to do on that first day in the White House.
His list includes starting up the mass deportation of migrants, rolling back Biden administration policies on education, reshaping the federal government by firing potentially thousands of federal employees he believes are secretly working against him, and pardoning people who were arrested for their role in the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

“I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,” he said of his Day 1 plans.

It was the dairy farmer in rural Wisconsin who believes that Donald Trump will be better for the economy, tariffs be damned. It was the 48-year-old North Carolina restaurant employee who voted for some Democrats down ballot but went for Trump hoping for cheaper gas and groceries. It was the Haitian American college student here in Reading who four years ago believed he would “never in a million years” support someone he considered a “racist bigot.”
This year, all three pulled the lever for Trump, part of a sprawling new coalition that reshaped the electoral map as it returned the former president to power.
“In 2020, I voted against Trump. This year, he changed my mind,” Chris Dolce, the student, said in an interview in this Latino-majority city Friday, as he picked up cheesesteaks from a bodega that still featured both a Trump sign and a Kamala Harris sign on an outside railing.

President-elect Donald Trump has won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes, The Associated Press said Saturday night, flipping yet another swing state and bringing his final Electoral College tally to 312. With his victory in Arizona, Trump has now won all seven of this year’s battleground states.

Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona is a reversion to the state’s traditionally conservative status: It has voted for a Democrat only twice since the 1940s, including in 2020, when Joe Biden eked out a win over Trump by just over 10,000 votes.
But this year, Democrats appeared to be fighting an uphill battle from the start in Arizona, a border state where voters expressed fury over the migrant crisis and deep economic concerns over the cost of housing and the high prices of everyday goods, like groceries and gasoline.

Democrat April McClain Delaney won election to a U.S. House seat representing Maryland on Saturday. The 6th District seat in western Maryland was open after Democratic Rep. David Trone sought the state’s open Senate seat rather than a fourth term in the U.S. House. McClain Delaney served in the Department of Commerce under the Biden administration and previously worked in a leadership role at Common Sense Media. The Associated Press declared McClain Delaney the winner at 9:32 p.m. EST.

While inflation and immigration emerged as the dominant themes in this year’s presidential race, another issue was prominent in the minds of voters for both major candidates: the stakes for democracy.
Half of voters identified democracy as the single most important motivating factor for their vote. That was higher than the share of voters who answered the same way about inflation, the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, abortion policy or free speech, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide.
Notably, backers of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, the president-elect, saw the issue from different perspectives.

Republican Rep. Eli Crane won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Arizona on Saturday. Crane, a freshman lawmaker, defeated former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, who was vying to become the state’s first Native American congressman. The Republican-leaning 2nd District covers a wide swath of Arizona, wrapping in Prescott, Flagstaff, the eastern part of the state and suburbs north of Tucson. It also includes more than half of the state’s 22 Native American nations. Crane, a former Navy SEAL, is a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and a staunch ally of Donald Trump. The Associated Press declared Crane the winner at 8:53 p.m. EST.

Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Washington state on Saturday, defeating Republican Joe Kent in a rematch of one of the closest races of 2022. Gluesenkamp Perez won the seat by just over 2,600 votes two years ago. Prior to her election, Gluesenkamp Perez ran an auto shop in a rural part of the district, which featured heavily in her campaign. The Republican-leaning district, which former President Donald Trump carried in 2020, includes the southwestern portion of the state and some Portland, Oregon, suburbs that spill into Washington state. The Associated Press declared Gluesenkamp Perez the winner at 6:36 p.m. EST.

President Joe Biden will host President-elect Donald Trump for a traditional postelection meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said Saturday.
Such a meeting is customary between the outgoing president and the incoming president, and is meant partly to mark the start of a peaceful transfer of power under America’s democracy.
But then-President Trump, a Republican, did not host Biden, a Democrat, for a sit-down after the 2020 election, when Trump lost his reelection bid.

Donald Trump announced on Saturday that his inaugural committee will be chaired by Florida real estate investor Steven Witkoff and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who he called “longtime friends and supporters.”
“This will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again,” Trump said in a news release.
Witkoff is the president-elect’s golf partner who was with Trump when the former president was the target of a second attempted assassination at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida in September.
Trump’s first inauguration was scrutinized for its lavish spending. The inaugural committee chair back then, California billionaire Tom Barrack, drew attention by raising $107 million for the event.
Trump’s businesses and the inaugural committee reached a deal to pay Washington, D.C. $750,000 to resolve a lawsuit that alleged the committee overpaid for events at his hotel and enriched the former president’s family in the process.
The committee maintained back then that its finances were independently audited, and that the money was spent in accordance with the law.

The fallout continued for Representative Seth Moulton after he doubled down on his comments earlier this week criticizing the Democratic Party’s support for transgender rights in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the presidential election, with one politician calling on Moulton to resign.
The Salem Democrat faced intense backlash after he told The New York Times on Thursday that Democrats focusing on identity politics had hurt the party, saying that he does not want his “two little girls ... getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.” The comments quickly led to a number of fellow Democrats in Massachusetts denouncing Moulton.

The Massachusetts economy had a good run when Donald Trump was last in the White House.
During his first three years as president — before COVID upended everything in 2020 — unemployment in the state fell to near record lows, and the typical Massachusetts family saw its income surge 21 percent. No one was complaining about inflation.
That was then. But what about now?
Trump is dusting off his first-term playbook — tax cuts, deregulation, sharp curbs on immigration, and steep increases to tariffs. It’s a strategy fraught with potential risks for the economy in Massachusetts and throughout New England.

In a deeply divided nation, political disagreements have strained relationships among friends and family members, perhaps none more publicly than with the Kennedys.
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, ended his long-shot campaign for president in August, he threw his support behind Donald Trump, which was met with a swift rebuke from his siblings, who called the move a “betrayal” of their family’s values.
Now, in the aftermath of Trump’s reelection, some members of the storied political family are expressing concerns over the possibility that RFK Jr., an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist, could have a powerful role in this second Trump administration.
In the waning days of the presidential election, Trump signaled that RFK Jr. could have a hand in shaping the nation’s health policies, saying he was poised to “go wild on health… go wild on the medicines.” Post-election, it’s not clear how far his influence might extend.

Republican David McCormick cut into Democratic Sen. Bob Casey’s support in Philadelphia and its populous suburbs and built leads in the more GOP-leaning parts of the state, foreclosing the incumbent’s pathway to victory when The Associated Press called the race Thursday.
McCormick was leading by more than 30,000 votes when AP called the race at 4:09 p.m., and though there were an estimated 91,000 votes still outstanding at that time, there were not enough in areas supporting Casey for him to make up the difference.

Several federal and state agencies are investigating how racist mass texts were sent to Black people across the country in the wake of the presidential election this week.
The text messages invoking slavery were sent to Black men, women and children, prompting inquiries by the FBI and other law enforcement departments.
“These messages are unacceptable,” said a statement from FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel. She said the agency takes “this type of targeting very seriously.”
While the texts varied somewhat, they all instructed recipients to “board a bus” that would transport them to a “plantation” to work as slaves, officials said.
Whoever sent the messages used a VPN to obscure their origin, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said Thursday morning.

Republican Representative Don Bacon will win a fifth term representing the Omaha-centered US House district for Nebraska, the AP projected. In yet another hard-fought bid, Bacon defeated Democrat Tony Vargas, a state lawmaker, in a rematch of their 2022 race. Unlike other GOP candidates in the solidly Republican state, Bacon emphasized his bipartisan credentials and highlighted his vote for the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Democrat Joe Biden won the 2nd District’s vote in the Electoral College in 2020, making it a top target as Democrats attempt to win back the House majority. The AP declared Bacon the winner at 6:11 p.m.

Zijie Li, 39, is being held without bond at the Palm Beach County Jail after being arrested Thursday when he arrived at Mar-a-Lago’s entrance gate in an Uber, the latest in a series of contacts he’s had with police and Secret Service agents at or near the estate since July.
Li, who lives in suburban Los Angeles on a student visa, had just been released from a mental hospital, where he had been placed in late October after police found him found near the estate. He is now facing two counts of misdemeanor trespassing.

Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in U.S. history, stirring emotions of joy, surprise and vindication.
New Mexico voters are sending 11 additional women — Democrats and Republicans — to bump up female representation in the 112-member Legislature. Female state senators will still hold a minority of seats — 16 out of 42.
In 2018, Nevada became the first state to elect a female legislative majority, later expanding it to more than 60% of seats with majorities in the state Assembly and Senate. Female legislators in New Mexico will hold a 54% majority — though with many more seats.

Harris grabbed headlines for her campaign’s fluent use of TikTok to reach millions of potential voters on social media. But it didn’t translate to victory at the polls.
Harris inherited the Democratic nomination just 107 days before the general election, but her campaign seemingly struck gold early on with a few weeks of viral fame on TikTok, the short-form video app that could be banned in the United States as soon as January. Videos referencing Harris’s now-famous coconut speech and supercuts of the vice president set to CharliXCX songs flooded the zone, as an online army of professional and amateur creators made content promoting her.
But Harris’s early hype and continued success on TikTok didn’t tip the scales on Election Day, and strategists on both sides of the aisle want to know why.

Walz vowed to make Minnesota a safe haven for the values that drove the Democratic presidential ticket he helped lead, while also promising to work harder to understand the concerns of President-elect Donald Trump’s voters.
Inside a high school auditorium in Eagan, Minnesota, a suburb about 18 miles (29 kilometers) south of Minneapolis, Walz addressed supporters with his reflections on Trump’s election victory, an outcome he said left him searching for answers.
“It’s hard to understand why so many of our fellow citizens, people who we have fought so long and hard for, wound up choosing the other path,” Walz said.
Walz promised to make Minnesota a bulwark against a second Trump administration’s potential attacks on abortion rights, immigrants and labor unions. He also called on all Americans to bridge the political divides that have widened during the election.

The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the leader of the Palestinian Authority has spoken with Trump for the first time since his victory in the 2024 campaign.
In a statement Friday, Abbas’ office in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah said that the president congratulated Trump on his victory and wished him success in his upcoming term. It said that Abbas told Trump he was ready to work with him in pursuit of peace and that Trump, in turn, “emphasized his commitment to the stop the war.”
The phone call follows months of resistance by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Biden administration’s push for a cease-fire that would see Israel end the war against Hamas in Gaza. Over 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians.
Trump and Abbas had a particularly rocky relationship during Trump’s first term, when his administration reduced outreach to the Palestinians and reversed decades of U.S. policy in the Mideast in Israel’s favor.

Susie Wiles will be the latest occupant of the hottest hot seat in Washington — Donald Trump’s chief of staff.
It’s a tough job under the best of circumstances, responsible for networking with lawmakers, administration officials and outside groups while also keeping the White House running smoothly.
But it’s been particularly challenging under Trump, who has a history of resenting anyone who tries to impose order on his chaotic management style. Four people served as chief of staff during his first term, and sometimes things ended on acrimonious terms.
Here’s a look at who came before her.

Trump’s victory instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe.
But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined.
Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say.
In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling.

US presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return.
Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing US alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill.
“We must not delegate forever our security to America,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday.
Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the US will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say.

Wisconsin Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul said Friday that his office is “prepared to defend the rights of Wisconsinites” during the next four years under President-elect Donald Trump.
His office joined several multistate lawsuits during the first Trump administration. And it is currently fighting to overturn an 1849 state law that Republicans argue bans abortion in Wisconsin.
But Kaul cautioned that he could do little if a national abortion ban is passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump. Trump promised during the campaign to veto any such national ban and leave it to the states to decide.
“I don’t want to give people false hope that there if there is a federal abortion ban passed, that there’s likely to be a successful legal challenge,” Kaul said. “On the contrary, if Congress does pass a ban, people are looking at having their access to safe and legal abortion taken away. I don’t want to see that happen.”

The judge overseeing Trump’s 2020 election interference case canceled any remaining court deadlines Friday after prosecutors said they need time to assess “the appropriate course going forward” after the Republican’s presidential victory this week.
Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Smith’s team has been evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases before the president-elect takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.
Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office.
In a court filing Friday in the 2020 election case, Smith’s team said it needs “time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.”
Smith’s team said it would inform the judge of “the result of its deliberations” by Dec. 2.

Donald Trump lavished Christopher Wray with praise when he named him FBI director in 2017, introducing him as an “impeccably qualified individual” and a “model of integrity.”
So much has changed in the seven years since.
With Trump poised to reclaim the White House, Wray’s days as director are likely numbered. Though the director’s job carries a 10-year term, Trump’s blistering and repeated criticism of his own appointee throughout his time as president raises the likelihood that Trump would either replace Wray upon taking office or that Wray would leave on his own to avoid being fired. Such a move would give Trump a chance to reshape the FBI’s leadership in his own image at a time when he’s threatened to pursue his own political adversaries.
Trump’s transition office did not return an email seeking comment. An FBI official said Wray was continuing to lead the bureau on a day-to-day basis — including visiting the FBI’s election command post multiple times this week — and was planning with his team to lead the bureau into the next year. The official, an executive who interacts with Wray on a day-to-day basis, was not authorized to discuss the details publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Among several blocs of religious voters, including his loyal evangelical base, Donald Trump fared roughly as well in his victory over Kamala Harris as he did in his loss to Joe Biden four years ago. One notable difference: He did better this year among Catholic voters, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters.
In 2020, the Catholic electorate — one the biggest religious blocs in the nation — was almost evenly split, with 50% backing Trump and 49% favoring Biden, a longtime member of the faith.
This year, according to VoteCast, 54% of Catholic voters supported Trump and 44% backed Harris — a shift that was particularly notable in North Carolina, Florida and Texas.
VoteCast documented a racial divide. About 6 in 10 white Catholics supported Trump, and about 4 in 10 supported Harris. By contrast, about 6 in 10 Latino Catholics supported Harris, and about 4 in 10 supported Trump.

Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack.
But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents’ efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world’s leading economy, those experts fear other countries — especially top polluting nation China — could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.
Trump’s reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.

Trump’s election could give him a chance to nominate up to two more Supreme Court justices if Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas retire, but a prominent conservative legal activist says there’s no rush.
“No one other than Justices Thomas and Alito knows when or if they will retire, and talking about them like meat that has reached its expiration date is unwise, uninformed, and, frankly, just crass,” said Leonard Leo, who serves as co-chair of the conservative Federalist Society and has been a driving force in securing nominations of conservative justices.
His comments come after Republican judicial advocate Mike Davis, a Trump ally who runs The Article III Project, speculated online that Alito could be “gleefully packing up his chambers.”

Republicans landed historic victories in Pennsylvania this week, winning the battleground state’s valuable presidential electoral votes, posting a two-seat gain in its U.S. House delegation and sweeping all four statewide offices on the ballot, including a US Senate seat.
The strong performance means Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania in two out of three tries, after Republicans had lost six straight presidential elections there.
Something similar happened in the other “blue wall” states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Rust Belt states where Trump prevailed again after losing in 2020. Still, Democrats held on in key Senate races in Wisconsin and Michigan, if just barely, and the results played out differently in each state.

Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, is preparing for another narrowly divided Congress, no matter which party wins the majority.
In an interview on New York’s Spectrum News, Jeffries insisted that Democrats “still have a pathway to taking back the majority” if the party can flip a series of seats in Arizona, Oregon and California where votes are still being counted.
“Whatever happens with the majority in the next Congress, Democrats will be no shorter than 212 to 214 votes,” Jeffries said.
He added that the race for control will come down to eight seats that Republicans currently hold. However, it has been extraordinarily difficult for either party to flip seats in this election. Across the country, Republicans and Democrats have been able to flip just three seats each so far.
Still, Jeffries led House Democrats through an election where they did not suffer the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races.
“We’ve been able to withstand that presidential wave that broke against us,” he said.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has led the House caucus through an election where Democrats have not suffered the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races, said Friday that his party should be “proud” of the legislative accomplishments of the Biden administration.
“It’s a record that both progressives and centrist members of both the House and the Senate supported,” Jeffries said on New York’s Spectrum News, listing legislation like the American Rescue Plan, a largescale infrastructure deal and legislation to address climate change.
“More needs to be done to meet the needs of the American people, to build an economy that works for everyday Americans because there are far too many people that are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck,” Jeffries added.

Democrats retained majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Friday by holding onto a Johnstown area district, giving them just enough votes to keep the speakership and determine the chamber’s voting agenda.
The win by incumbent Rep. Frank Burns is the final House race to be called in a year when none of the 203 districts are changing hands. It gave Democrats a 102-101 margin and dashed Republican hopes of returning to control after two years in the minority.
Burns’ win is some consolation to Democrats in what has otherwise been a banner electoral year in Pennsylvania for the Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump won in the state, Dave McCormick beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, two Democratic congressional seat were flipped and Republican candidates won all three of the state row offices.

Big shifts within small groups and small shifts within big groups helped propel Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
The Republican candidate won by holding onto his traditional coalition — white voters, voters without a college degree and older voters — while making crucial gains among younger voters and Black and Hispanic men, according to AP VoteCast, a far-reaching survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide.
His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, made small gains — most significantly with white urban men with a college degree — but it wasn’t enough to offset her losses elsewhere.

Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts.
Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden’s time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250.
“With this new administration, the dream is gone. It’s shot,” said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. “I was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it’s at a standstill.”
President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden’s loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances.

Israeli residents of “Trump Heights” are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights.
During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him.
But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or “Ramat Trump” in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation.
Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements.
“President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,” Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, said.

As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback.
“Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,” Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he’d arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. “We will see you soon.”
Four years later, he’s fulfilled his prophecy.

A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration policy that aimed to ease a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens.
The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.
The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as “Keeping Families Together” would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House.

The public opinion polls said Tuesday’s presidential election would be a nailbiter. But it looked a lot different at online prediction markets where people bet real money on the outcome. Markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket showed a consistent lead for Donald Trump.
And they were right. In the end, the election wasn’t even close. Trump easily exceeded the 270 electoral votes he needed and unlike his 2016 victory, he appears on track to win a majority of the popular vote.
Meanwhile, sites that relied on aggregating data from public opinion polls consistently predicted a razor-close race. The respected 538 site called it 50-49 Harris; statistician Nate Silver had 48.6 percent for Harris versus 47.6 percent for Trump; and Real Clear Polling gave both candidates a 48.5 percent chance of victory. Clearly, investors at prediction sites saw something that the pollsters missed.
“The winner of this election has been prediction markets.” said Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University and creator of Virtual Tout, a website that displayed prediction data on the presidential election in near-real-time.

Donald Trump’s biggest European fan, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, is predicting that his administration will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Orbán’s comments were a signal that Trump’s election could drive a wedge among EU leaders on the question of the war.
Hungary’s leader is hosting the second of two days of summits Friday in the capital, Budapest. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda for a gathering of the EU’s 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent’s security.
The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion.
“If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn’t have happened. There wouldn’t have been a war,” Orbán said. “The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.”

While Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.
For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, nothing is changing. “In the near term, the election will have no effects” on interest-rate policy, he said.
At this point, Powell said it’s still not clear what the policies will be after Trump returns to the White House.
“We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said.

At 78, Donald Trump became the oldest person to be elected president on Tuesday. To a surprising extent, he can thank Gen Z.
On his way to a decisive defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump made substantial gains among young voters, particularly among young men who supported the Republican by a 14-point margin, according to a Tufts University analysis.
When President Biden defeated Trump four years ago, voters between ages 18 and 29 backed him 61 percent to 36 percent. But on Tuesday, Harris carried the demographic by only six points, 52 percent to 46 percent, according to an analysis of AP VoteCast survey data by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University.
“We’re seeing a rightward shift among young people, or a Trump-ward shift, if you will,” said Abby Kiesa, the center’s deputy director.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised Donald Trump over his election victory and expressed optimism for stronger relations between Turkey and the United States during his second term.
In comments made late Thursday, Erdogan also voiced hope that conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could come to an end through collaboration with Trump.
Erdogan said Trump had won the election despite facing significant challenges, including an assassination attempt and criminal charges. “Despite this, he continued his election campaign with much strength, tirelessly and with resilience,” Hürriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as telling journalists during a flight back from trips to Kyrgyzstan and Hungary.
Despite periods of tensions in relations between their countries, Erdogan had built a close relationship with Trump during his first term in office. In contrast, President Biden’s administration had maintained a distanced approach toward Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian leader.
Erdogan said Trump had made “positive statements about Turkey” during a telephone call earlier this week, adding that he had extended an invitation for the incoming president to visit.
Erdogan also said that in the upcoming period, he would raise the issue of a possible withdrawal of US troops from Syria with Trump.

As Maine election officials say a key congressional race needs to go to ranked choice counting, you may ask — how does that work?
The uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the US House.
Rather than cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, voters rank their choices in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate is the winner.
But if no candidate surpasses 50%, the count continues in round two. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

The idea of grabbing some popcorn and watching television to see who America has chosen for its next president was far less appealing this year than in the past.
The Nielsen company said that 42.3 million people watched election night returns between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump pour in Tuesday night. That’s down sharply from the 56.9 million who watched in 2020, when Trump competed against Joe Biden, and the 71.4 million who tuned in on election night 2016, Nielsen said.
Election night is often known as the Super Bowl for TV news, but this year even the NFL’s conference championship games were watched by more people.

Donald Trump’s victory in the United States presidential election instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe.
But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined.
Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say.
In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling.
Those potentially affected come from dozens of countries and many have already sold their homes and their possessions to fund the trip.

U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return.
Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill.
“We must not delegate forever our security to America,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday.
Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say.

“I will do my duty as president. I’ll fulfill my oath and I will honor the Constitution,” Biden said as the sounds from the construction of the nearby inaugural parade viewing platform drifted across the White House grounds. “On January 20th, we’ll have a peaceful transfer of power here in America.”
In his first public address since the election, Biden took the high road even as he became the center of the blame game among fellow Democrats for Vice President Kamala Harris’s resounding loss to President-elect Donald Trump.

Two days after Election Day, it’s now clear that former President Donald Trump will return to the White House, and Republicans will control the U.S. Senate. However, the outcome of the US House remains uncertain.
While most of the 425 House races weren’t competitive due to partisan composition or gerrymandering, roughly 30 seats have yet to be called by the Associated Press by late Thursday afternoon. Most of these remaining races are heavily leaning toward one party or the other.
Republicans hold a 210–198 advantage, with 17 seats uncalled. Exactly 218 seats are needed for a majority. In other words Republican need to win just eight of the remaining 17 races. Democrats must win 15 out of the remaining 18 races uncalled.
The bottom line: Republicans appear likely to secure a slim majority, similar to the one they hold now. Democrats still have a path to the majority, but everything must go their way from here on out.

Democrats defended three key House seats in Nevada, wins that helped them hold ground in the nationwide race for House control.
However, the party still needs to flip seats elsewhere to have any hope of retaking House control.
Practically every seat matters now that it is coming down to the last couple dozen races to be called for the 435-seat chamber. Republicans currently hold a thin majority and just need to hold their seats in the races that have yet to be called.
The elections so far have produced few changes to the makeup of the House. Republicans flipped a pair of seats in Pennsylvania, won one more in Michigan and picked up three more redistricted seats in North Carolina. Democrats, meanwhile, flipped three in New York and picked up another redistricted seat in Alabama.

Susie Wiles was the manager of Trump’s victorious campaign and will now serve as his White House chief of staff.
Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign. She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.
“Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,” Trump said in a statement. “It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”
Wiles is a longtime Florida-based Republican strategist who ran Trump’s campaign in the state in 2016 and 2020. Before that, she ran Rick Scott’s 2010 campaign for Florida governor and briefly served as the manager of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign.

When Trump entered the White House the first time, Republicans held a 51-seat majority and many within the party were willing to resist his plans.
Now, Trump is going back with a healthy Senate majority _ at least 53 seats _ and a party transformed by his MAGA movement.
A couple of Republican senators are still willing to publicly buck Trump. But there are enough GOP senators to confirm Trump’s Cabinet -- or a possible Supreme Court justice -- even if a few split.
Republican leaders say they want to keep the Senate’s filibuster rules, which require a 60-vote margin for most legislation. But they’re also looking at using a process called budget reconciliation to pass some legislation with a simple majority.
Republican lawmakers want to extend tax cuts from Trump’s first term and fund tougher border enforcement measures.

Republican Dave McCormick’s win in Pennsylvania added to his party’s Senate majority and completed their dominance in a state that was crucial to both the presidential and congressional elections.
McCormick unseated Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, giving Republicans their 53rd seat in the Senate.

“In this election, Americans have made their voice clear: Democrats need to focus more on issues Americans care about, like wages and benefits, and less on being politically correct,” he said.
Suozzi added that Democrats “failed as a party to respond to the Republican weaponization of anarchy on college campuses, defund the police, biological boys playing in girls’ sports, and a general attack on traditional values.”
“We cannot get wrapped around the axle by our base and resistance politics,” he said.
Suozzi represents a district on Long Island that includes parts of the New York City borough of Queens.

As it became clear Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. “Y’all are in trouble,” he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media.
Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump’s victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them.
Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he has called “hostages” and “patriots,” during his victory speech on Wednesday. But his defeat of Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy.

A problem with the formula Boston’s election department used to calculate and schedule ballot deliveries to polling locations led to the ballot shortages reported on Election Day, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said.
“We’re just in the early stages of the review, but it sounds like there was an issue in . . . how the supply was calculated to be able to get enough ballots to those locations,” Wu told reporters at an unrelated event. “After that was discovered, the city mobilized quickly and worked to deliver ballots.”
Wu’s explanation comes after Secretary of State William F. Galvin announced Wednesday he was launching an investigation into Boston’s Elections Commission after residents and poll workers reported ballot shortages that led to “unreasonable and unnecessary delays” for some voters Tuesday. The city had previously attributed the problem to high voter turnout.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, issued a statement thanking the Harris-Walz campaign for running “an inspired and positive campaign focused on lifting people up.”
But the New York lawmaker issued caution on the status of the House races, saying “we must count every vote” in outstanding states like Arizona and California.
“I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial,” Jeffries said. “Our Democracy is precious and it involves elevating public trust in our system of free and fair elections, not undermining it.”
He also quoted President Joe Biden, adding “We cannot love America only when we win.”

California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a fierce critic of Trump, called for lawmakers to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency.
The move — a day after the former president resoundingly defeated Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration.
“The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle,” Newsom, who reportedly has ambitions on the national stage, said in a statement. “California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond. We are prepared to fight in the courts, and we will do everything necessary to ensure Californians have the support and resources they need to thrive.”
Newsom and lawmakers say they’re ready to “Trump-proof” California’s state laws. His announcement called on the Legislature to give the attorney general’s office more funding to fight federal challenges when they meet in December.

Joe Biden’s name wasn’t on the ballot, but history will likely remember Kamala Harris’s resounding defeat as his loss too.
As Democrats pick up the pieces after President-elect Donald Trump’s decisive victory, some of the vice president’s backers are expressing frustration that Biden’s decision to seek reelection until this summer — despite long-standing voter concerns about his age and unease about post-pandemic inflation as well as the US-Mexico border — all but sealed his party’s surrender of the White House.
“The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden,” said Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris’ unsuccessful run. “If he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place.”
Biden will leave office after leading the United States out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will affect communities for years to come.

Republican Jeffrey Hurd will win election to a US House seat representing Colorado, maintaining Republican control of the 3rd District seat now represented by GOP Representative Lauren Boebert, the AP projects. Boebert, who nearly lost her seat to Democrat Adam Frisch in 2022, decided this year to run for former Republican Rep. Ken Buck’s vacant seat in territory that’s even friendlier to Republicans. The victory by Hurd, an attorney seen as a moderate alternative to Boebert, marked the second loss in a row for Frisch, a former City Council member from Aspen, who campaigned as a pragmatic businessman. The Associated Press declared Hurd the winner at 12:10 p.m.

Biden says defeat does not mean we are defeated.
“America endures,” he said. “We’re going to be ok, but we need to stay engaged.”
President Biden: "Now we have 74 days to finish the term, our term. Let's make every day count. That's the responsibility we have to the American people...A defeat does not mean we are defeated.

Even as Trump celebrates his victory, he is still under a cloud of federal charges for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.
That may be coming to an end.
Jack Smith, the prosecutor appointed to investigate Trump, is evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases against Trump before he takes office, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. That’s because a longstanding Justice Department policy says sitting presidents can’t be prosecuted. The charges stemming from the documents case had been dismissed, but Smith was appealing to have them reinstated.
The person familiar with Smith’s plans was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.
By moving to wind down the cases before the inauguration in January, Smith and the Justice Department would be averting a potential showdown with Trump, who said as recently as last month that he would fire Smith “within two seconds” of taking office.
Trump is still mired in other legal cases, and their fate is unclear. He has already been convicted for his connection to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election.

Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory.
Yet the Fed’s future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump’s economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed’s policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank’s interest rate decisions.
The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again.

Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States, social media users began pushing two conflicting narratives to suggest election fraud, one that revived false claims by Trump that the 2020 vote was stolen from him and the other questioning how Vice President Kamala Harris could have received so many fewer votes in 2024 than President Joe Biden in 2020.
Both narratives hinge on a supposed 20 million vote gap between Harris and Biden.
Here’s a closer look at the facts.
CLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago.
THE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday’s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday’s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times.

The House contests remain a tit-for-tat fight to the finish, with no dominant pathway to the majority for either party. Rarely, if ever, have the two chambers of Congress flipped in opposite directions.
Each side is gaining and losing a few seats, including through the redistricting process, which is the routine redrawing of House seat boundary lines. The process reset seats in North Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama.
Much of the outcome hinges on the West, particularly in California, where a handful of House seats are being fiercely contested, and mail-in ballots arriving a week after the election will still be counted. Hard-fought races around the “blue dot” in Omaha, Nebraska and in far-flung Alaska are among those being watched.

“I have long admired the United States of America as the champion of democracy, freedom and the rule of law,” the Tibetan spiritual leader said in a message to Trump from the northern Indian town of Dharamshala where he has lived in exile since fleeing Tibet in 1959.

With a win in Wisconsin early Wednesday, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency. But his exact margin of victory is still unclear— there’s two presidential races yet to be called:
Arizona: Officials in Arizona’s Maricopa County said late Wednesday they’ve got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means the races for president and senate were too early to call. In all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday.
Nevada: AP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada — including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. The AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday.

The surge began overnight once election results rolled in showing Donald Trump the likely winner. By the time Dr. Angel Foster logged on at 7 a.m. Wednesday, the number of women who had reached out to her small Somerville-based nonprofit to request telemedicine services and access to abortion pills was approaching 100. By lunchtime it had doubled.
Foster founded the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, or the MAP, a little more than a year ago to make sure women around the country had safe means to end a pregnancy. Demand has steadily risen as word of MAP’s existence spread across states that passed restrictive laws in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.
But Foster had never seen anything like what happened Wednesday.
“We’re still just 12 hours from the election results getting released, but the surge is palpable,” Foster said just before lunch. “It’s astonishing.”

Donald Trump’s election night party in south Florida was hyped as a celebration. It ended up being the starting gun for his second term as president.
By the time Trump took the stage at the Palm Beach Convention Center shortly after 2 on Wednesday morning, expectations of a drawn-out battle for ballots in narrowly divided key swing states had melted into a decisive Electoral College and popular vote victory.
Instead of a muddled and contested process of transitioning to a new administration — one that might have involved both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris until a winner was called — the new president-elect has the full 75-day period until Inauguration Day to prepare to take power.

On election night in 2016, as Kamala Harris became just the second Black woman to win a Senate seat, Donald Trump’s surprise presidential victory prompted her to rip up her planned speech.
Instead, Harris delivered an off-the-cuff rallying cry to Democrats to “fight,” a moment that vaulted her into the national political conversation.
Now, eight years later, her decisive loss to Trump sent her historic presidential aspirations and that soaring career crashing back down to Earth. And with it, the hopes of millions of American women that she would break through a glass ceiling that has proved impenetrable.

Donald Trump ran a campaign centered on hypermasculinity, actively courting young men in particular with interviews on popular male-centric podcasts.
In the closing weeks of the campaign, the former president and many of his surrogates leaned into sexist remarks and jokes about Vice President Kamala Harris.
Some of his supporters, including former presidential rival Nikki Haley, warned that the former president risked exacerbating his persistent gender gap with Harris. Prominent surrogates from billionaire Elon Musk to Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, called on men to vote in large numbers to counter Harris’ expected strength among women.
In the end, the gender voting gap was unremarkable by recent historical standards.

Trump has already appointed three Supreme Court justices. In his second term, he could well have a chance to name two more, creating a high court with a Trump-appointed majority that could serve for decades.
The decisive outcome spares the court from having to wade into election disputes. It also seems likely to change the tenor of cases that come before the justices, including on abortion and immigration.
The two eldest justices — Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74 — could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger and ensure conservative domination of the court through the middle of the century, or beyond.

Former president Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wished Trump and running mate JD Vance well, writing that they “hope they will govern for all of us.”
The Clintons had been some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of Trump. The former Democratic president stumped across the country for Harris and running mate Tim Walz, while the former secretary of state, Trump’s opponent in 2016, had criticized her one-time rival throughout the entire election. The two commended Harris and Walz for running “a positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.”
“We must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election, and what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward and one that falls back,” they wrote. “We need to solve our problems and see our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on it.”

New England voters, as expected, delivered their states to Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday night, but beneath that result were signs of the same rightward shift that unfurled across the country and delivered Donald Trump a decisive victory.
While Trump remains generally unpopular in blue Massachusetts, he improved his 2020 showing here by around 4 percentage points and even flipped two dozen communities. That rightward lurch even here also delivered wins for the embattled state Republican Party on Beacon Hill as well as victories for other Republicans across New England.

“Build the Wall” was Trump’s rally cry in 2016, and he acted on his promise by tapping military budgets for hundreds of miles of border wall with Mexico. “Mass Deportation” was the buzzword that energized supporters for his White House bid in 2024.
Trump’s victory sets the stage for a swift crackdown after an AP VoteCast survey showed the president-elect’s supporters were largely focused on immigration and inflation — issues the Republican has been hammering throughout his campaign.
How and when Trump’s actions on immigration will take shape is uncertain.
While Trump and his advisers have offered outlines, many questions remain about how they would deport anywhere close to the 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally. How would immigrants be identified? Where would they be detained? What if their countries refuse to take them back? Where would Trump find money and trained officers to carry out their deportation?

“First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,” Sanders said.
Sanders won reelection to a fourth term on Tuesday. He singled out wealth inequality, a slipping standard of living in the U.S., a lack of full health care guarantees and support for Israel’s recent military campaigns as problems Democrats need to focus on. Sanders’s 2016 presidential run was a key factor in pushing the dialogue in the Democratic party to the left.

The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts.
When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he’ll target.
These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities.

Congratulating Trump and Vance, the Obamas expressed pride for Harris and Walz, for both of whom they campaigned, calling them “two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.”
The Obamas cast forward with hope for a divided America, saying that the nation’s problems are solvable “only if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.”

More than 70 national, state and local LGBTQ+ rights and advocacy organizations released a “solidary statement” Wednesday reacting to the results of this week’s elections.
“Election outcomes at national, state, and local levels will impact our health, our safety, and our rights as LGBTQIA2S+ people and families,” the statement read. “Despite anti-LGBTQIA2S+ efforts to divide our communities, and particularly severe attacks against transgender people and LGBTQIA2S+ youth, we have succeeded in moving a few steps closer toward equity and justice for our community.”
The letter highlighted the reelection of lesbian U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and the election of the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, of Delaware.
The statement did not mention Trump by name. But he and other Republican candidates frequently employed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in campaign ads, remarks and platforms, particularly against transgender and nonbinary people.
The statement was signed by groups including the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, GLAAD, many PFLAG and Equality chapters, the Transgender Law Center, Advocates for Trans Equality, and the Trevor Project, a youth suicide prevention organization.
Jaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said separately in an email that volume on its crisis line from LGBTQ+ youths seeking help increased about 125% on Election Day through midday Wednesday.

“The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” Harris said. “But hear me when I say, the light of America’s promise will always burn bright, as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.”
Harris had planned to address an audience like this at Howard on election night and had hoped she would have a more upbeat message to deliver. Instead, when Harris took the stage at her alma mater, she looked out at a sea of America flags and notably forlorn faces. She was flanked by 30 American flags.

O’Malley Dillon said Harris “isn’t finished in this fight” and said the staffers who worked for the vice president are “going to be leaders in this collective mission.”
“View this as the beginning, not the end” she concluded. “It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work.”
