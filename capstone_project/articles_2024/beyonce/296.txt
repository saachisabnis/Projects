Pop icon Taylor Swift has taken over the sports world given her relationship with Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. The singer’s popularity has drawn even more attention to nation’s most popular league as its biggest game approaches.
T-Swift has been at each of the Chiefs’ three NFL Playoff games, sitting with the Kelce and Mahomes families while rooting on the AFC champs on the field.
Her impact on ratings is undeniable – look no further than the Bills-Chiefs postseason matchup that drew a record 50.4 million viewers. The most watched Divisional Round game ever!
It’s impossible to miss her cheering from her box suite week in and week out as camera cutaways seem to consume any downtime in the action.
Is there another celebrity that would garner the same attention Swift’s received? Shannon Sharpe and Chad Johnson posed that very question on their Nightcap podcast.
The debate came in reference to a hypothetical Super Bowl halftime show scenario with Sharpe saying Swift would be the NFL’s top pick.
Johnson replied by mentioning Beyonce, who performed in 2016 and 2013.
“Taylor Swift has generated an equivalent brand value of $331.5 million for the Chiefs and the NFL… Tell me of another person that’s gonna do that!” Sharpe exclaimed.
Johnson suggests Beyonce, which prompted an immediate rebuttal from his co-host.
“Beyonce ain’t moving the needle like this chick, Ocho” he said.
OchoCinco was in disbelief, as were members of the BeyHive who quickly posted in the comments section.
“The Super Bowl’s lights went out when Beyonce performed let’s BFFR!”
“Let him know, Ocho! Throw the whole mic away, Unc.”
“If Beyoncé was single and dating Cam Newton or Odell in their prime, she definitely would have moved the needle.”
“Beyonce has a multi-generational and cross-cultural fan base that exceeds Taylor’s reach.”
@ShannonSharpe take this down before the beehive see this 😂😂

Too late!
What Taylor Swift has done in terms of ratings and exposure for the NFL is undeniable, but the Hive wants Sharpe to put some respect on Beyonce’s name.
