2024 was THAT year for fashion.
Throwing fits wasn’t just about getting dressed— this year fashion was a tool of self-expression, a catalyst for cultural shifts, and a way to bridge the worlds we love of music, sports, and politics. From red carpets dripping in designer labels and unexpected looks to courtside couture and sports tunnel attire, this year showed us that style is everywhere.
And so are the Black influencers, celebrities, fashionistas, “it girls,” and models who create it.
More than ever, fashion in 2024 cemented itself as a force that reflects and shapes societal movements. Athletes became style icons, political leaders redefined power dressing, and trends born on TikTok transformed into full-blown cultural phenomena. Whether it was Zendaya serving tennis-core perfection or Beyoncé making cowboy couture mainstream, these moments didn’t just inspire us—they rewrote fashion rulebooks.
So, let’s break it down and talk about the moments that had us gagging.

This year marked a game-changing style evolution for the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA). While players have always brought their unique flair to fashion, stars like Angel Reese, A’ja Wilson, and Kysre Gondrezick elevated court couture to new heights. These athletes didn’t just dominate with plays and baskets—they made bold, trendsetting style statements that shook the fashion world.

It all began with the WNBA Draft, which felt more like a Hollywood red carpet than a sports event. Red carpet moments from the event went viral, rivaling any A-list gathering. Players stunned in looks from sought-after luxury labels and indie designers alike.

Then, the WNBA tunnels became full-fledged runways, with cameras eagerly waiting to capture the drip players brought to every game. Like other sports, tunnel arrivals merged style and sports, setting the tone before tipoff.
This blending of sports and fashion has amplified visibility for the WNBA, sparking partnerships with luxury brands, magazine covers, and invites to high-profile events. The players’ influence reaches beyond the court, inspiring young athletes and fashion lovers to embrace a mix of athletic and chic styles.

Leave it to Zendaya to make us all want to pick up a tennis racket—or at least dress like we did. During her Challengers promo tour, Zendaya, with her go-to stylist Law Roach, redefined preppy athleisure with a tennis-core twist.
From turf-inspired green ensembles to tennis ball-accented heels, her looks served an athletic edge with high-fashion precision. This wasn’t just a fleeting trend; it dominated 2024, influencing everything from ready-to-wear collections to viral TikTok moments.

Even the resurgence of the bubble skirt—this fall and winter’s must-have bottom—has roots in tennis-core. All proving once again that Zendaya doesn’t just follow trends; she sets them.
The culure is saddling up, because Beyoncé made 2024 the year of cowboy couture. Much like its RENAISSANCE predecessor, Beyoncé’s Act Two: Cowboy Carter wasn’t just about the music—it was a cultural movement.  Inspired by country aesthetics, the cowboy trend featured denim, cowboy boots, hats, and statement belt buckles. But in true Bey fashion, these staples were reimagined with a modern, feminine twist.

The trend quickly transcended Beyoncé’s visuals and outfits, making its way to runways, closets, and retail stores. This is further proof (as if we needed any) that this is Beyoncé’s world, and we’re just living in it.  The Bey Hive leader’s collaboration with Levi’s solidified the movement, introducing a line that emphasized empowerment while challenging traditional perceptions of women’s fashion in music and history.
Fast forward to her 2024 NFL Christmas Day performance. Beyoncé closed out the year in stunning all-white cowboy-inspired ensembles, bringing the trend full circle in true Texas style.

2024 wasn’t just about the ladies—men’s fashion had its own glow-up, thanks to Colman Domingo and Daniel Julez Smith Jr.
Colman turned every red carpet into his personal runway. His appearances during awards season, especially at the Critics’ Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, showcased his flair for bold, head-turning fashion. The award-winning actor stunned in dramatic capes, bold lapels, and impeccably tailored suits, proving that menswear can be anything but boring.
Meanwhile, Solange’s son, Daniel Julez Smith Jr., made waves on the runway. From his debut with Luar at New York Fashion Week to subsequent appearances, the Knowles family member redefined male modeling. With the support of his famous aunt Beyoncé, grandmother Tina Knowles, and mom Solange, Daniel raised the profile of men on the catwalk. His performances added prestige to the luxury brands he represented and brought a sense of fantasy to runway presentations.

These two icons elevated men’s fashion in a way that felt fresh, exciting, and impossible to ignore. Other slayers that have to be mentioned this year include Pharrell Williams, Dwyane Wade, A$AP Rocky, and Lewis Hamilton.
The 2024 Paris Olympics didn’t just bring gold medals—it brought preppy athleisure back into the spotlight. Black female athletes like Simone Biles, Gabby Thomas, Jordan Chiles, and Sha’Carri Richardson captivated global audiences with their performances and style, influencing fashion trends worldwide.

Brands such as Polo Ralph Lauren played a significant role in this movement, blending traditional Americana with contemporary sportswear. Additionally, Black designers like Telfar and Actively Black contributed to team uniforms and Olympic-inspired collections, bringing diversity and innovation to the forefront of fashion.
This fusion of patriotism and sporty chic attire led to a renewed interest in preppy styles. Varsity jackets, polo shirts, and tailored shorts found new audiences and ways of styling.
Kamala Harris’ historic presidential campaign didn’t just change politics—it changed fashion. Her 2024 run brought a fresh perspective to power dressing. From the Vice President’s signature Converse and pearls to bold suits in vibrant colors, VP Harris challenged traditional notions of political attire and helped redefine power dressing.
The Washington Post
Harris’s fashion choices, along with those of her high-profile supporters like Kerry Washington, Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Obama, showcased a blend of professionalism and personal expression. The tan suit she wore during a pivotal campaign event drew parallels to President Barack Obama’s similar ensemble, symbolizing a connection between historic Black political figures and their impact on fashion.

Coach went off in 2024, and Cardi B may deserve some of the credit. When she name-dropped the luxury brand in her viral hit “Like What,” the internet went into a frenzy. Fans starting dissecting the line – causing Cardi B to respond herself – and Coach seemed to respond with arguably one of the most talked about runway shows of the season.
Their Spring 2025 Ready-to-Wear show redefined the brand, offering oversized silhouettes, whimsical designs, and must-have bags. More specifically, the collection debuted the Chain Tabby 26 and introduced playful variations of its frame bag in exaggerated sizes and shapes.

Coach brought in a more youthful lens to fashion led by their creative director, Stuart Vevers. Speaking to The Impression, the director emphasized merging the brand’s classic heritage with a more free-spirited and light collection aimed at today’s youth.
Whether Cardi B officially started this transformation or not is debatable, but Coach’s couture and design changes are not. The brand is on its way to becoming one of the must-have accessories in 2025.

Like it or not, weight-loss drugs like Ozempic reshaped red carpet fashion this year. Sheer fabrics, sleeker silhouettes, and bolder skin-baring styles dominated as Hollywood embraced rapid physical transformations.
While this sparked debates and social media chatter around body positivity and beauty standards, it undeniably influenced how designers approached dressing celebrity clients, creating a new wave of ultra-tailored, daring looks. Celebrities and influencers looked different from one event to the next, changing the way the world sees it self.

A year of constant visible physical transformations – following the opposite during and immediately following the pandemic – 2024 brought out a more vain side of fashion, trend, and what we wear.
If 2024 taught us anything, it’s that fashion and culture are inseparable. With Coach making a massive comeback, WNBA stars redefining sporty chic, and Beyoncé’s cowboy couture still riding high, 2025 promises to be just as bold.
Looking ahead, expect Black designers like Telfar Clemens, Sergio Hudson, Hanifa, Heron Preston, and Brandon Blackwood to keep dominating the runways. Meanwhile, size inclusivity and cultural diversity will (hopefully!) take center stage on the runway again as the industry continues to evolve.
On the streets, comfort will remain key, with leather, denim, and statement accessories still reigning supreme. Next year’s culture defining moments are yet to happen, but one thing is for certain that they will provide a road map for fashion of the future.
2025, we’re ready for you. Let’s make it stylishly iconic.
