Kelvin Harrison Jr. is ready to show fans a whole new version of the iconic Disney villain Scar.
The actor, 30, exclusively told Us Weekly that he initially approached his role in Mufasa: The Lion King with Jeremy Irons’ original portrayal of Scar in mind until he was given some guidance by director Barry Jenkins.
“I originally did want to come in and just do, like, a copy-paste, and [Barry] was like, ‘Well we got to develop an arc for him, and just make sure we understand what that brotherhood was and what that love for each other looks like,’” Harrison Jr. told Us at the EBONY Power 100 Gala on November 17.
A prequel to the 2019 live-action remake of The Lion King, Mufasa: The Lion King tells the story of how Mufasa (Aaron Pierre) and Scar, whose real name is Taka, became brothers and eventual rivals. Irons, 76, lent his voice to the original 1994 animated film, while Chiwetel Ejiofor took over the villainous role in the revamped version.
Scar’s notable British accent is something Harrison Jr. put a lot of consideration into, telling Us he had to dial back his voice “more and more and more to find a baseline.” He explained: “I reference gumbo a lot because I’m from New Orleans, so I consider it’s like the roux, you know what I mean? I’m out oiling my flour and that’s where the baseline [is], and then I start putting in my celery and my seasonings — and that’s when Jeremy Irons becomes Jeremy Irons. There will be a moment where it becomes a little bit more recognizable.”
While much of the film’s plot remains under wraps, Harrison Jr. says fans will “get to understand why Scar is the grump uncle he is,” as well as hear “a lot of new music.”
“I remember getting the email that there’s a new ‘Hakuna Matata’ and I was like, ‘What?’ So, that’s pretty cool,” he shared. “It’s going to be a fun experience. Barry Jenkins is making a movie about the legend Mufasa, everything we expect.”
While “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” remains his go-to song from the original Lion King film, Harrison Jr. teased that a new track from the Mufasa: The Lion King has become a personal favorite.
“In our movie, ‘I Always Wanted a Brother’ is a banger,” he told Us. ‘The kids killed that one. And [I like] ‘He Lives in You’ from the Broadway version.” (A Broadway rendition of The Lion King hit the stage in 1997.)
With one month until the movie hits theaters, Harrison Jr. is feeling grateful for “kindness and community” heading into the next chapter of his career. “This is a hard job and it gets harder every year, and the world gets more complicated every year,” he stated. “So, having people that you trust and love that are looking out for you, and even when they’re not in the best place, they’re still showing up for you in ways that they couldn’t even imagine. That’s love, and how I reciprocate that. So that’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned and that keeps me going.”
Mufasa: The Lion King also sees the return of several stars of 2019’s The Lion King, including Donald Glover as Simba, Beyoncé as Nala, Billy Eichner as Timon, Seth Rogen as Pumbaa and John Kani as Rafiki. New cast additions include Tiffany Boone as Sarabi, Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros, Thandiwe Newton as Eshe, Keith David as Masego and Anika Noni Rose as Afia.
