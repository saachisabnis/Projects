Hey, I'm Crowley. Sarcastic, Sardonic, some call me a cynic...I prefer to think of myself as a realist. I also prefer to think of myself as moderately attractive and talented, but that's a whole other ball of wax that 5 shrinks in the past 15 years haven't been able to figure out, so I think it's best just to leave it there.

Your laughs may vary; you may not enjoy "The Prediddor" as much as I did.
