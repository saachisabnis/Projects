Lily Allen recently stirred the pot with some candid comments that seemed to throw a bit of shade in Beyoncé’s direction amidst the release of her highly anticipated album, Cowboy Carter. The 38-year-old multi-talented artist, who is famously married to Stranger Things heartthrob David Harbour, didn’t hold back during a recent appearance on the Miss Me? podcast.
When podcast host Miquita Oliver asked Lily if she had heard Beyoncé’s latest album, Lily didn’t hesitate to share her thoughts. “I’ve heard a few bits,” she admitted, before mentioning that she had listened to tracks from Miley Cyrus and the Blackbird. However, Lily confessed that she hadn’t listened to the entire Beyoncé album from start to finish just yet.
Miquita then complimented Beyoncé’s appearance, to which Lily responded with a hint of skepticism, suggesting that Beyoncé might have some assistance in looking flawless. “She’s got a great team of stylists, great hair people, she works out, [she’s] got access to the best personal trainers in the world—She’s Beyoncé,” Lily remarked, implying that Beyoncé’s glamorous appearance may not solely be the result of natural beauty.
Delving deeper into her critique, Lily touched on Beyoncé’s choice of covering Dolly Parton’s iconic hit, “Jolene,” on the album. Lily found the decision “very weird” and questioned the strategy behind it. “It’s quite an interesting thing to do when you’re trying to tackle a new genre, and you just choose the biggest song in that genre to cover,” she pointed out, suggesting that Beyoncé’s approach to exploring new musical territory might lack originality.
While Lily’s comments may come across as a bit provocative, they offer an intriguing perspective on Beyoncé’s latest artistic endeavors. As one of the industry’s most outspoken figures, Lily isn’t one to shy away from expressing her opinions, even if they ruffle a few feathers.
As the debate over Beyoncé’s latest album continues to ignite conversations among fans and critics alike, Lily Allen’s candid commentary adds a fresh layer of intrigue to the ongoing discussion surrounding the music industry’s biggest releases. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Lily’s take, her unfiltered remarks serve as a reminder that in the world of entertainment, diversity of opinion is what keeps things interesting.
