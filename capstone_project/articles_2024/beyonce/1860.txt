Azealia Banks has made it clear that she’s not a fan of Beyoncé, and she once again taken aim at the singer for what she’s calling “white woman cosplay” on her new album, Cowboy Carter.
In a scathing attack posted on her Instagram story on Tuesday (March 19), the controversial provocateur started out by implying that the ex-Destiny’s Child leader was trying to behave like a white woman.

“Sis, I live for Whiteyonce Donatella Bianca Bardot DOWN, but I’m kind of ashamed at how [you] switch from Baobab trees and Black Parade to this literal pick me stuff,” she began.
Azealia then implied that Bey went above and beyond for the Dixie Chicks because they were white women, but that the same courtesy would never be extended to her.

“Like u do lame stuff like bring out some blacklisted white women (Dixie Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. and they would never, ever do the same for you. Ur always sharing ur platform with white women, who are so jealous of you but have such a long history of sabotaging other black careers,” she wrote. “You’re reinforcing the false rhetoric that country music is a post-civil war art form.”
After questioning why Beyoncé would attempt to break into an art form that didn’t make her feel welcomed, Azealia Banks roasted “16 Carriages,” claiming that it “didn’t make any sense.”

“Had you made a great country song … going number one should be the headline without the weird race part,” she concluded. “But like Kelsea Ballerini and Carrie Underwood have better songs than whatever nauseating little Bey on the prairie stuff is going on.”

As of this writing, Beyoncé hasn’t responded to Azealia Banks’ claims.
Despite Banks’ comments, Beyoncé continues to prepare for the release of Cowboy Carter, as she has shared more details about the second act of her Renaissance trilogy.

On Tuesday (March 12), the superstar singer posted an image of a saddle against a black background on her Instagram Stories. Stretched across the brown padding is a red, white and blue ribbon that reads Cowboy Carter — the title of the upcoming LP. A rep for the singer clarified that this image is not the cover of the album.
Whereas the post itself doesn’t reveal any further details, the pre-order link stamped on it redirects to a web page exclusively for Act II, with limited-edition products such as vinyl records, CDs, and box sets. Some packages come with t-shirts.
