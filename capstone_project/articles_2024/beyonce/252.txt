Team USA has Beyoncé’ s full support throughout the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.
On Friday, July 26, the 32-time Grammy winner, 42, surprised millions of viewers when she introduced Team USA during NBCUniversal’s primetime coverage of the Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony.
Beyoncé was seen in the footage sporting a red, white and blue bodysuit, accompanied by a cowboy hat and cowboy boots. The singer also named several of the athletes competing for Team USA, including Simone Biles, Sha’Carri Richardson, Noah Lyles, Caeleb Dressel and Katie Ledecky, as “YA YA” from her latest album Cowboy Carter played in the background.
“Hello, girls,” the superstar said.
“Hello, Beyoncé,” members of the women’s gymnastics team — including Jade Carey, Sunisa “Suni” Lee, Simone Biles,  Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera — replied.

She then continued with a motivational message: “Get a look at America, y’all. These hopes and dreams, these superstars that represent us. The people of this big, bold, beautiful, complicated nation. All rooting together for them.”
“Come on, you’ve gotta love Noah and Sha’Carri. The fastest man and woman on the planet. They’ll race the world anytime, any place,” Beyoncé added. “How about Caeleb? Proud papa, back in the drink for more gold. And Katie? The longer the race, the better she swims. And I know you know my girl Simone. Born to fly, destined to inspire. We’ve got superstars and we’ve got legends. We’ve got big dreamers who fought their whole lives to get here. Who gave up everything for one shot, and made it.”
The promo video also featured clips of some of the athletes competing in their sport, and others dancing to “YA YA.”
“That pride and that joy — that’s what gets me about this team and that’s what makes me believe in this team,” Beyoncé concluded. “And that’s why I can’t wait to see what they pull off over these next 16 days. America, give it up for Team USA, the very best of who we are. What a vision to behold. What a team to believe in. What a night to celebrate.”
