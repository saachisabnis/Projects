HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - At the State Capitol on Wednesday, lawmakers recognized an Ewa Beach native who has become one of the world’s most popular social media influencers.
Bretman Rock can now add another honor to a long list of achievements. He was recognized by state representatives and the Legislature’s Filipino Caucus for his work in bringing positive attention to Hawaii and Filipino Americans.
In addition to having his own MTV reality show, the Campbell High School alumnus, beauty influencer and LGBTQ+ ambassador has a massive social media presence with over 35 million combined followers on TikTok and Instagram.
“Your influence reaches far beyond our shorelines and you’ve touched the lives of countless individuals across Hawaii and beyond, inspiring us all to embrace our uniqueness and celebrate our individuality,” said State Rep. Darius Kila (D), Honokai Hale-Nanakuli-Maili.
After being adorned with lei and receiving a gavel from the legislators, the 25-year-old social media star joked, “There are three rocks in Hawaii: Barack, The Rock and Bretman Rock.”
“It is truly an honor to be honored today,” he said.
Last year, Bretman Rock was featured in Vogue Philippines and recently became an ambassador for Beyoncé's hair care line.
