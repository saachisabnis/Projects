Santa might have his sleigh, but this Christmas, Beyoncé is bringing the true holiday magic to Netflix — and the NFL — with a Cowboy Carter Christmas. 
For the first time, Queen Bey will take the halftime stage during NFL Christmas Gameday, streaming live on Netflix on Wednesday, Dec. 25. While the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens battle it out on the field, the real showstopper will be inside Houston’s NRG Stadium, where Beyoncé is set to sleigh slay with the first live performance of songs from her groundbreaking, Grammy-nominated album Cowboy Carter.
Produced by Beyoncé’s own Parkwood Entertainment alongside Jesse Collins Entertainment, this anticipated performance sets to reimagine the football halftime show as it streams live to Netflix’s global audience of roughly 287 million paid subscribers. (Here's hoping they fixed the glitching issue.) In true Beyoncé fashion, expect boundary-pushing visuals, jaw-dropping choreography, and, if the rumors are true, a star-studded lineup of surprise guests straight from Cowboy Carter.
Grab your eggnog and cowboy boots — here’s everything you need to know about Beyoncé’s holiday halftime extravaganza.
This year's NFL Christmas Gameday will feature two back-to-back games, but all eyes are on the Texans vs. Ravens showdown at 4:30 p.m. EST. While the players fight for playoff standings, Beyoncé's halftime show is poised to steal the spotlight.
For the first time in history, the NFL is teaming up with Netflix to stream the halftime show live, making Beyoncé’s performance accessible to millions of fans worldwide. It’s a groundbreaking moment for live sports and streaming entertainment, proving once again that Beyoncé knows how to elevate a stage.
Here are the essentials to mark on your calendar:
Date: Wednesday, Dec. 25, 2024
Game Time: 4:30 p.m. EST (Texans vs. Ravens)
Where to Watch: Live on Netflix
Halftime typically begins about an hour into the game, so tune in early. As far as we know, the official performance will only be available during the live stream, so don't miss your chance to see it in real-time.
Beyoncé’s latest album, Cowboy Carter, is a genre-defying work that blends country, R&B, hip-hop, funk, and soul elements. Since its release earlier this year, it’s broken streaming records, earned multiple Grammy nominations, and sparked countless think pieces about its cultural impact, especially in the notoriously rigid country music industry.
The halftime show marks the first live performance of songs from Cowboy Carter, making this a must-watch event for fans and pop culture aficionados. And if you've been waiting for Bey to drop the album visuals, you'll want to tune in. 
With its bold storytelling and sonic diversity, the album has become one of Beyoncé’s most celebrated works, and anticipation is sky-high to see how she brings it to life on stage.
The setlist is anyone’s guess — only Beyoncé knows the answer to this most pressing question — but we can expect a mix of high-energy anthems and emotionally resonant tracks from Cowboy Carter. Some likely contenders include:
A fan-favorite for a good reason, "YA YA" fuses vibrant funk, thumping rock 'n' roll, cheeky lyricism, relentless Tina Turner-esque soul, an interpolation of the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations," and a powerhouse vocal performance into one glorious showstopper. 
On this gorgeous reimagining of The Beatles classic, Beyoncé croons alongside four rising Black women country stars: Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy, and Brittney Spencer.
Nominated for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 2025 Grammy Awards, this soaring ballad finds Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus channeling full Thelma & Louise energy. Its heartfelt lyrics and sweeping melody could provide the perfect slow moment amid an otherwise high-energy set.
Don’t sleep on Beyoncé’s bars; she can rap when she wants to, and this track proves it. At first glance, it might seem like an unconventional pick, but hear me out — it’s the only song on the album that delivers its thesis statement: "Genres are a funny little concept, aren’t they? Yes, they are," declares country legend Linda Martell in a spoken-word intro. The song also features Shaboozey, the genre-defying country star whose breakout Hot 100 hit, "A Bar Song (Tipsy)," has made him one to watch this year. 
If the Houston Texans are playing, you better believe that Houston native Beyoncé will pull out all the stops for a foot-stomping, barn-burning performance of "Texas Hold 'Em."  
Imagine B and Dolly P on the same stage for a performance of "Jolene" that combines Dolly's timeless, plaintive storytelling with Beyoncé's powerful vocal dynamism. This duet could reimagine the classic in a way that pays homage to its roots while infusing it with a more modern flair. (It would also send a statement to the Country Music Association.) 
While the lineup of special guests remains under wraps, speculation is swirling about who might join Beyoncé during her performance. Will we see a duet with a country superstar? A surprise cameo from someone unexpected? Or perhaps a family moment with her daughter Blue Ivy?
Fans are hoping for appearances from the collaborators featured on Cowboy Carter. Shaboozey and Miley Cyrus, both pivotal voices on the album, seem like natural choices for cameos. Their distinctive styles mesh seamlessly with Beyoncé's genre-blending vision, and their presence would electrify the halftime stage.
Some country icons who lent their talents to the album, such as the legendary Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, could also appear. These collaborations significantly shaped the album’s narrative, bridging traditional country with contemporary flair.
Let’s not overlook the contributions of Black country musicians who have added richness and depth to the album's soundscape. A potential appearance by Rhiannon Giddens, whose masterful banjo licking embodies the intersection of country, folk, and Black musical traditions, would be a powerful moment that underscores the album's cultural significance.
The possibilities are endless, given Beyoncé’s history of pulling off jaw-dropping surprises. One thing is certain: She knows how to share a stage without losing an ounce of her shine.
