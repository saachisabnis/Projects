Megan Thee Stallion logs her third No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with “HISS.”
The single earned a total of 29.2 million streams in its first week, including 2.9 million radio airplay audio impressions and 104,000 downloads. “HISS” marks the Houston Hottie’s third chart-topping effort on the Billboard Hot 100 chart following “WAP” with Cardi B on August 2020 and “Savage” with Beyoncé in May of the same year — officially tying Nicki Minaj’s Hot 100 record amidst their ongoing public beef. Both rappers now have three chart leaders each; Cardi B leads the female rappers with five.
In addition to landing on top of the Hot 100, “HISS” also claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Rap Songs, Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts.
