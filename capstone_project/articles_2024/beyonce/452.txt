James Jannard listed a Beverly Hills compound for $68 million shortly after his record Malibu sale.
The Oakley founder recently set a record with a $210 million Malibu mansion sale, surpassing Jay-Z.
Forbes estimates Jannard's net worth to be $1.3 billion.
Just days after making a record-breaking Malibu mansion sale for $210 million, James Jannard is back with another mammoth listing.
The sunglasses mogul, who founded Oakley, just put his Beverly Hills, California, cement compound up for sale at $68 million, as first reported by Realtor.com.
Jannard recently surpassed Jay-Z and Beyonc√© to claim the title of California's most expensive home real-estate sale, and Forbes estimates his net worth at $1.3 billion.
After starting Oakley in 1975, Jannard eventually sold the company 32 years later for $2.1 billion to the Italian company Luxottica. He later founded the digital cinema camera company Red Digital Cinema before retiring in 2019.
Scroll down to check out inside the mansion.
The futuristic fortress, which spans 18,000 square feet, features five bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and an intimidatingly giant oval courtyard.
The property, which Jannard purchased in 2009 for $19.9 million, was originally built in 2016, according to the listing. It's in Trousdale Estates, which sits in the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains.
Trousdale Estates has housed several stars since the 1950s, including Elvis, Elton John, and Jane Fonda.
Resting on one of Beverly Hills' highest points, the luxurious neighborhood offers a sweeping view of Los Angeles and easy access to Sunset Boulevard. Its average home value is about $7 million, according to Zillow.
The mansion, which took five years to finish, boasts a brutalist design with bare cement walls, aluminum ceilings and accessories, and all-metal fixtures.
Inspired by Stonehenge, according to Wallpaper, the cavernous manor includes floor-to-ceiling windows and oversize columns. Jeff Vance, the owner of the architecture firm iDGroup, designed acoustic panels to remove echo and create a cozier living experience despite its cold appearance.
Jannard reportedly also owns property in Newport Beach, California, two islands in Fiji, and a third in the Pacific Northwest.
The former Oakley CEO shelled out $7 million for a Newport Beach house back in 1999, the Los Angeles Times reported. Jannard reportedly also bought an acre of land north of the area and Corona del Mar for an additional $8 million.
The kitchen is fully chrome, and nearly all the house's furniture is custom-made.
There is both a gourmet kitchen and a full chef's kitchen, as well as a bar, according to the listing.
Some rooms are softened by wooden floors and expansive windows and skylights for the sun to brighten.
The property is just under 2 acres, according to the listing, and is priced at roughly $3,700 per square foot.
Curved walls lead to the guest bedroom and a separate guest apartment.
The guest and owner's rooms flank one side of the living area, while service rooms reside on the other side for a symmetrical layout.
The central lounge area overlooks a massive infinity pool.
The living room has a full glass wall that can retract into the ground for an unobstructed view of the Los Angeles basin.
The light fixtures are made with tumbled aluminum, as is nearly all the seating and hardware.
Some rooms have wood accents to cut through the overwhelming industrial design furniture.
The owner's bathroom includes a metal tub inscribed with a sentence written in J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish language.
Red, Jannards second company, manufactured the digital cameras that were used to film the "Hobbit" franchise.
The concrete fort also includes a movie theater, a gym, a wine cellar, and an elevator.
The home theater stays on the sci-fi theme with gray lounge seats and cement blocks adorning even grayer walls.
