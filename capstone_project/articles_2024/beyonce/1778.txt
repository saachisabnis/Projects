WASHINGTON (TNND) — In this year's election, Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump received notable celebrity endorsements, but their impact was questionable.
Harris garnered support from A-list stars like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Bruce Springsteen. However, her campaign seemed to suffer from the association with high-profile figures.
A key example is a town hall event with Oprah Winfrey, for which the Harris campaign spent $1 million on production costs, according to FEC filings. However, Winfrey was never paid directly, per Variety. Despite this effort, the endorsement did not significantly benefit Harris.
An analysis from The New York Times pointed out that while Harris gained Hollywood's backing, it did not resonate with voters focused on practical issues, like the economy.
Trump benefitted from influential figures like Joe Rogan, whose podcast reaches millions of young male listeners.
A sit-down interview with Rogan was seen as potentially more effective than traditional Hollywood endorsements, especially in swing states where voters may not connect with Hollywood values, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Analysts suggest Harris's decision to decline an interview with Rogan was a missed opportunity.
Celebrity endorsements can make a difference if the star is as big as Oprah Winfrey.
A study from the Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization suggests Winfrey contributed approximately one million additional votes for Barack Obama. 
In 2008, eight million people watched her daily talk show, and an estimated 16 million read each Oprah Magazine issue. The study classifies Winfrey as a celebrity of "unparalleled popularity." However, what worked back then doesn't work now. Winfrey backed Harris, but It was not enough to secure a win.
