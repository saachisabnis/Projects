An award-winning night out has announced dates at Asylum in Hull for May and June - including a Country-themed special.
The mix of traditional bingo in a nightclub setting has made Bongo's Bingo one of the most in-demand nights out in the UK. Attendees can expect rave rounds, dance-offs, mass karaoke sessions, and the chance to win crazy prizes such as Henry vacuum cleaners, giant pink fluffy unicorns, and much weirder rewards.
Since starting out as a random idea in 2015 between two friends - Johnny Bongo and Joshua Burke - to play traditional bingo in a nightclub setting, Bongo's Bingo has turned into one of the biggest travelling nights out in the country.

 Along with an extra day to recover thanks to the bank holiday, the next special event will be a Country-themed night. Country music has re-entered itself in pop culture with the likes of Beyoncé changing up genres with her newest album - Cowboy Carter. Expect plenty of Shania Twain, Luke Combs, Dolly Parton, and Chris Stapleton on the night.
Jonny Bongo, Bongo’s Bingo’s co-founder, said: “Spring’s really hotting up and we’ve got some fantastic shows happening in Asylum in Hull. The May Bank Holiday long weekend is always special with the extra day off, so this Saturday, May 4th show is going to be special, along with further dates in May and June including our Country Special.”
Tickets are available at www.bongosbingo.co.uk. Further Hull dates are Saturday, May 25, Friday, May 31 and Saturday, June 22. The Country special will be held on Saturday, June 8.
