Beyoncé hailed Willie Nelson “the coolest,” and shared a heartfelt tribute to the legendary country star on Instagram.
The two Texas-born artists stand side-by-side in the first of several photos in Beyoncé’s Instagram post. She wrote in her caption: “The Great Willie! You are the coolest! I admire you, and I sincerely thank you for being the pioneer you are. Thanks for your impactful music, your advocacy, and the gracious way you appreciate and celebrate other artists! You are 1 of 1.
“You were so kind to me and the girls of Destiny’s Child when we fanned out meeting you years ago. And you greeted me with the same kindness 20 years later!” Beyoncé continued. “You are one of our national treasures. Sending my love to you ❤️🐝🇨🇱🤠”
