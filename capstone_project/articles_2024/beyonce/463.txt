Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 are eligible for nominations, so don’t expect to see album nods for Future's “Mixtape Pluto” (though Future and Metro Boomin's “We Don’t Trust You” is very likely to score a nomination), George Strait's “Cowboys and Dreamers,” Tyler, the Creator’s “Chromakopia,” or “Warriors,” Lin-Manuel Miranda's first full post-“Hamilton” musical with Pulitzer finalist Eisa Davis. 
There's plenty of unknowns going into the announcements: Will Beyoncé and Post Malone receive nominations in the country music categories following the success of their massive albums “Cowboy Carter” and “F-1 Trillion,” respectively, even though they are megastars previously not directly associated with the genre?
Will Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)," the biggest song of the year that combines his country twang with the familiar sample of J Kwon’s 2004 rap hit “Tipsy" dominate?
The 2025 Grammy Awards will air Feb. 2 live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.
