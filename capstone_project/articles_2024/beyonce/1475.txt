Toni Cornell took to Instagram on Wednesday (November 13) to announce the upcoming release of her debut single, “Sunset of Your Love,” on November 21. Toni is the 20-year-old daughter of late Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell. The video post features behind-the-scenes glimpses of Toni working on the song in the recording studio, while also containing a snippet of the finished version of the moody, beat-driven track. Toni captioned her post, “Excited to finally announce the release of my first song Sunset of Your Love 🌅🍑💜 Yours November 21st.” 
Toni also shared that she worked with songwriter Mozella on the track, which was produced by Dave Hamelin, who worked on Beyoncé’s Grammy-nominated song, “16 Carriages.” Since her father’s tragic death in 2017, Toni has performed a variety of covers as she found her voice, including Temple of the Dog’s “Hunger Strike,” Pearl Jam’s “Black,” Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” and Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” (Consequence of Sound)
