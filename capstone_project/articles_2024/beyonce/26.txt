His breakthrough came with the release of “Tha Carter” series, particularly “Tha Carter III,” which won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and solidified his status as one of the greatest rappers of his generation. Hits like “Lollipop,” “A Milli,” and “Got Money” became anthems, showcasing his ability to blend catchy hooks with intricate wordplay.
