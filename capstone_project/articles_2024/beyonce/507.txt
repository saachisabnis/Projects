New research has found that listening to popular artists like Drake, Ariana Grande, Eminem, Billie Eilish, Beyoncé and Harry Styles can make you a better driver. 
A study by Autotrader tested car operators, who were subjected to 20 popular artists while their “hazard perception” was being tested on the road.
“Higher scores indicate greater levels of concentration, meaning the participants identified and reacted to hazards quicker when listening to that artist,” researchers noted in their hypothesis.
Lovers of list-topping Canadian rapper Drake started far from the bottom by scoring 59.5 out of 75 on their hazard perception scores. 
Grande and Slim Shady fans tied for second place at 58.5, while Eilish listeners were third with 57 for their defensive driving dexterity.
The Korean pop group BTS tied with The Weeknd at 56.5 for fourth place.
Beyoncé came in fifth with a score of 55.5 — barely partitioned from the Foo Fighters, who rated a 55 for sixth. 
“Watermelon Sugar” singer Styles zipped into the seventh spot with 54.5, and The 1975 followed with a 54 rating.
Meanwhile, two artists of different centuries seemed to offer dangerous tendencies for listeners behind the wheel.
Hip-hop phenom Megan Thee Stallion and classical composer Johann Sebastian Bach scored 37.5 and 42.5, respectively. 
The test’s passing grade was 44 out of 75.
