If you’re an A-lister seeking to announce your pregnancy to the world, you do it in full glam—everyone knows that. Whether a smoky of eye and bare of bump Rih, or Beyoncé, resplendent before a wall of flowers, the hair, makeup, and nail choices are nearly as important as the news itself. Well, kind of.
Which is why it’s only appropriate that Hailey Bieber announced the upcoming arrival of baby Bieber with her signature manicure. On long, almond-shaped nails, Bieber sported her longtime favorite—which she helped make popular—the glazed doughnut manicure. Slightly pink in tone, the iridescent look was as luminous as she was, her unmistakable pregnancy glow emanating through the photos.
Created by Zola Ganzorigt—the original artist behind the manicure that went viral a few years ago—Bieber’s soft, neutral manicure was the perfect choice to to simultaneously announce the happy news and renew her vows with Justin after six years of marriage. As we all know, a neutral manicure is versatile, unimposing, and delivers on the natural new mum points. Congratulations to the happy couple.
