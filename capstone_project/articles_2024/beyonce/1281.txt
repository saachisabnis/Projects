That’s one way to walk on the wild side.
Taylor Swift enjoyed a day date with Travis Kelce at Sydney Zoo last week ahead of playing four sold-out Eras Tour shows in the Australian city, dressed in a casual tank top and denim miniskirt paired with some subtly statement-making sneakers.
The pop mega-star picked a pair of Adidas Superstars accented with leopard-print stripes and black heel tabs — which just so happen to be on sale right now for about 35% off, bringing their price down from $110 to $72.

While Swift doesn’t often wear sneakers while out and about – typically reaching for ankle boots or platform loafers instead — she owns several other Adidas styles, including a few from Beyoncé’s Ivy Park collaboration.
She’s also recently been spotted in black Samba OGs ($100), and has a pair of classic black-and-white Stan Smiths ($100) in her wardrobe as well.
Other sneaker styles she’s sported over the past few months include the black, red and white New Balance 550s ($150) she wore to cheer on Kelce at her first Kansas City Chiefs game in September and the similarly team-colored custom Nike Air Force 1 Lows ($135) she showed off at an October game — the latter of which appeared to have been a gift from the tight end.
Following her two trips to the zoo to check out the Aussie wildlife, Swift was back in her Louboutin heels for four straight nights of shows at Sydney’s Accor Stadium, with her football-playing beau in the audience for the first performance.
