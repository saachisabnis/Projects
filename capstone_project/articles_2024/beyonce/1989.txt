Popeyes has been on a roll lately, with the US fast food brand opening new restaurants up and down the UK, and launching a bunch of exciting new menu items.
The Louisiana chicken chain (the very same chicken that Beyoncé and Jay-Z served at their wedding) recently wowed us with a new Cajun breakfast offering (the hash browns are life-changing), then a spicy Buffalo twist on the famous Chicken Sandwich was released, as well as Buffalo chicken wings.
And now they’ve done it again and added another new item into the mix — and this one is bound to be a hit with diehard fans.
Fast food fans love a ‘secret’ menu item, but often actually getting your hands on this sort of thing is tricky. 
However, Popeyes is giving customers exactly what they want, by transforming a viral secret menu hack into an actual burger you can order any time you fancy.
The chain is adding the Double Stack to the UK menu, which allows customers to upgrade their Chicken Sandwich order and make it a double. According to Popeyes, around 500 people each week order both a Chicken Sandwich as well as an extra chicken breast in order to create an epic burger just like this.
Those looking to do this won’t have to order extra food anymore, as they can now get two Shatter Crunch chicken breasts inside a brioche bun as either a Classic Double Stack Sandwich, or a Spicy Double Stack Sandwich, which has a slathering of spicy mayo.
Both stacks are available from all Popeyes restaurants, drive-thrus, and via delivery right now and they cost £7.99 (or more if you want to make it a meal).
Dave Hoskins, head of food at Popeyes, said: ‘Team Popeyes is excited to announce the arrival of the new Double Stack Sandwich to our UK menu. Our customers love our chicken, and sometimes they want even more of it when ordering our legendary Chicken Sandwich. 
‘We’ve seen the hack, we’ve listened to our fans and we’re pleased to be making the Double Stack official – so more people can easily opt for some extra Shatter Crunch in their Sandwich.’
Popeyes first touched down in the UK in November 2021, opening its doors in Westfield’s food court in Stratford, London.
The New Orleans-inspired chain has since launched 35 other sites across the UK and they’re not stopping any time soon, as they announced plans to double their restaurants, drive-thrus, and delivery kitchens in 2024.
The new restaurants will be located in areas such as Glasgow, Swansea, Birmingham, and Exeter, with more to be announced soon.
This comes after another top US fast food chain recently revealed they were also expanding their offering in the UK.
We’re talking about Wendy’s, a staple of American fast food since November 1969 when Dave Thomas opened his very first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.
