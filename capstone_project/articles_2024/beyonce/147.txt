The smashing success of the Eras Tour hasn’t just been a boon for Swift and her team; it’s also given a boost to the economies of the cities it passes through. 
The survey company QuestionPro estimated that the tour could generate close to $5 billion in consumer spending in the U.S. alone as Swifties travel far and wide to see the pop star live, spending money on travel, accommodations, food and, of course, new outfits.
Swift’s superstardom is nothing new, but she’s managed to reach even greater heights this past year. With the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July 2023, she became the first woman to have four albums on Billboard’s Top 10 chart simultaneously. The rerecorded album was also Swift’s 12th record to reach No. 1, more than any other female artist in history. 
Just last month, Swift’s Album of the Year Grammy win for Midnights made her the only artist to win the accolade four times. (Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra and Paul Simon comprise the small list of people who have won three times.) 
Swift even made America’s most popular sport more relevant when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Throughout the 2023 NFL season, viewership among teen girls increased 53 percent as glimpses of Swift cheering on Kelce provided a new reason to tune in. 
According to Apex Marketing Group, the pop star generated $331.5 million in “brand value” for the Chiefs and the NFL. The Chiefs’ February 11 Super Bowl win against the San Francisco 49ers is the most-watched telecast of all time, and it’s safe to say that Swift had a hand in that. What if we told you none of it was accidental? We’re dealing with a mastermind, after all.

Cooper signed a $60 million three-year deal with Spotify in 2021, making her the second-highest paid podcaster on the streaming giant’s payroll. As host of the mega-popular podcast “Call Her Daddy,” Cooper has conducted tell-all interviews with stars including Miley Cyrus and John Mayer. 
Not one to rest on her laurels, Cooper launched The Unwell Network in August 2023, signing influencers Alix Earle and Madeline Argy to develop their own podcasts. She also cofounded a “Gen Z media venture” called Trending with fiancé Matt Kaplan that June. The umbrella company is comprised of The Unwell Network, “Call Her Daddy” and Kaplan’s ACE Entertainment. 
“The goal as I get older is I don’t want to just be relying on ‘Alex Cooper’ and ‘Call Her Daddy,’” she explained during a February interview with The New York Times. “The point of starting this was also so that I have all these different ancillary businesses that can be running.”

Longoria became a household name while starring on Desperate Housewives in the mid to late 2000s and has since added producing and directing to her resume. 
Her directorial debut, Flamin’ Hot, earned several accolades during the 2023 awards season, including Best Feature Film at the 38th annual Imagen Awards. Longoria will be back in front of the camera in Apple TV+’s Land of Women this summer.
Longoria has also spent years advocating for more Latino representation in the entertainment industry. 
“My favorite rooms to be in are with fellow Latinas and aspiring Latina artists — whether they're directors, writers or actors,” she said during a February interview with USA Today. “A big reason I got behind the camera to produce and direct was to build this pipeline of talent that doesn’t normally get the opportunities.”
