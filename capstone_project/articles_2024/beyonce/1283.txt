Pimp C‘s widow Chinara Butler is none too pleased about her late husband’s name being brought into Nicki Minaj‘s beef with Megan Thee Stallion.
In an Instagram livestream, she played a snippet of an unreleased track that poked fun at the Houston Hottie’s injuries from being shot in the feet by Tory Lanez. She also mocked Megan’s rapping by freestyling in an exaggerated Southern drawl and making light of Meg’s oft-stated UGK influence. “Who you wanna be, [UGK members] Bun B or Pimp C?” she pointedly asked.

In response, Butler, whose husband died in 2007, took to her Instagram on Friday (January 26) to address the slight.
“That #MeganLaw hit a nerve I see,” she wrote, referring to a lyric in Megan’s new song “Hiss” that appears to be directed at Minaj and her husband Kenneth Petty.

“Oh and I heard you #Nikki that $hit wasn’t funny or cool,” she continued, presumably in response to Minaj’s use of her late husband’s name.
“I’m [gonna] address her ass,” Butler wrote in response to a commenter who said that Nicki’s mention of Pimp C “wasn’t funny at all.”

Tension between Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion has been simmering for years.
In September 2022, Nicki claimed that an unnamed person told her to get an abortion, alluding to that person being Megan.

“Imagine telling someone you didn’t want a drink… you know, because you were, at the time, possibly pregnant, because you were actively trying to have a baby,” Nicki said on Queen Radio at the time. “Imagine that person saying, ‘Oh girl, you can go to the clinic!’
“Imagine posting photos that you’re pregnant… and the person doesn’t even like it or say congratulations. But then, when you post that Beyoncé sent you flowers congratulating you, the person then tries to attempt to send you flowers thinking that, ‘Oh, I could use this opportunity as I use everyone else. She’ll post that I sent her flowers.’”

She added: “I didn’t even let them shits in my muthafuckin’ house.”
When a fan told Megan she was being accused of “encouraging abortion and child endangerment with alcohol,” the Traumazine rapper replied: “LIE.”

On another occasion in December 2023, Nicki Minaj appeared to take shots at Megan on her Pink Friday 2 song “FTCU” with references to Tory Lanez and Iggy Azalea.
“Stay in your Tory lane, bitch, I’m not Iggy,” she rapped on the song.

Megan and Iggy previously had an issue in 2019 over a failed collaboration, but the miscommunication was quickly cleared up.
Iggy was also rumored to be dating Tory in 2022 and wrote a letter in support of him in his shooting case against Megan.
