As the holiday season approaches, the excitement builds not just for festive gatherings and twinkling lights, but also for the return of beloved holiday music. This year, the iconic Mariah Carey will usher in the festivities with a special performance during the inaugural NFL Christmas Gameday, set to air live on Netflix on Dec. 25.
Carey, known for her chart-topping hit “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” will deliver a pre-recorded performance of this classic song, setting the tone for a day filled with football and holiday cheer. This event marks a significant move for Netflix as it ventures into the realm of live sports entertainment.
The NFL Christmas Gameday will feature two thrilling matchups. The current Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will take on the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 p.m. ET, followed by a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. ET. Adding to the excitement, Beyoncé is also scheduled to perform a live halftime show during the Ravens-Texans game. With Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, playing for the Chiefs, fans are speculating whether she will make an appearance as well.
Carey is no stranger to the holiday spotlight. This year, she is celebrating the 30th anniversary of her legendary holiday album, Merry Christmas. The album features her iconic single “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which has achieved a remarkable milestone, being certified 16-times platinum by the RIAA. This makes it the highest-certified single ever from a female artist, solidifying Carey’s status as the Queen of Christmas.
In addition to being available on Netflix, the Christmas Day games will also be broadcast on local CBS affiliates in the competing team cities, including Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Houston. Fans can also catch the action on NFL+ through mobile devices in the U.S., ensuring that no one misses out on this unique blend of sports and holiday entertainment.
