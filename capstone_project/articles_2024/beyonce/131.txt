(Gray News) - Taylor Swift’s latest album is already setting records in just the first few hours of its release.
On Friday, Spotify, a digital music service, revealed that Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” became the first album in its history to gain 200 million streams in a single day.
The service then updated that news early Saturday, reporting that first-day streams ended up surpassing 300 million.
“History made!” the company shared online. “On April 19, 2024, Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department was the first album in Spotify history to have over 300M streams in a single day.”
According to Billboard, Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” passed Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter” album to become Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day.
Swift also previously held the record for most streams in a single day set in 2022 with her “Midnights” album and in 2023 with “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” Variety reports.
“The Tortured Poets Department” features 31 tracks and is the pop superstar’s 11th album and first album of new music since her Grammy-winning “Midnights” album.
According to The Associated Press, the album’s lead single and opener “Fortnight” is “1989″ grown up — and features Post Malone.
Swift’s latest album also features collaborations with Florence + the Machine with writing and production contributions from Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, Billboard reports.
