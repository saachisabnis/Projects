It had been years since 34-year-old Rachel Parrish of Chicago went to the club with her girlfriends. So when she was in Las Vegas on a recent trip, she immediately noticed a stark difference in women's fashion since the days she was partying in her prime.
So Parrish opened her phone, recorded her observations − and her outfit − and shared the video on TikTok. It had racked up nearly 20 million views as of Saturday (it was posted on July 15) and turned Parrish into a social media star overnight.
"I don't know what's happening to club culture, but the girlies are not wearing heels in the club anymore," Parrish says in the video. "As a 34-year-old, do we need to come out of retirement and teach the girls how to wear heels or what heels you need to shop for when going out in the club?"
Parrish wore a strapless green dress and block white heels, and quickly became known as "green dress girl" as her video spread and a debate ignited.
Parrish's controversial viewpoint set off a heated debate on multiple social media platforms. Many women argued that heels are essential to their club wardrobe, while some said they unapologetically wear flats or sneakers.
Parrish, a public relations specialist, didn't expect her opinion to make such a splash. And when some commenters took digs at her dress and shoes, she took it in stride.
"It was beyond anything that I could comprehend," she recently told USA TODAY. "I am very lucky that I have a strong community and a strong support system. It's fashion. We all have good days. We all have bad days."
Although many women still wear high heels to the club, experts say plenty of other partygoers now prioritize comfort.

When Parrish went to clubs in the 2010s, business casual − sometimes with a twist − was a popular look. Millennials wore outfits that worked both for board meetings and the bar. It was corporate to cocktail. (Think Express!)
"We played hard, just like we worked hard," Parrish recalled. "I distinctly remember the bandage dresses and the pencil skirt with a button-up."
Today's club scene, she added, is a "very different culture than I was used to growing up."
Back then, it was all about collared shirts and bodysuits accessorized with statement belts and chunky necklaces. Fitted blazers and platform pumps were the standard, regardless of rain, sleet, or snow.
"One of the shoes that was popular back then was the Christian Louboutin Daffodile heels," said veteran celebrity stylist and costume designer Ebony Brown. "It came with spikes on it, and you could get a pair with the crystals on it. That was one of the shoes that took over and dominated that era."
Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and Kim Kardashian were all captured rocking the sky-high shoes by photographers.
In her video, Parrish says the thrill of the club is "dancing on the couch in heels," but the hype around that kind of venue is fading. In major cities like New York and Atlanta, the most anticipated parties are not only held in clubs but also open-area locations, lounges, restaurants, and rooftop bars, according to DJ Miss Milan, the official DJ for recording artist Doechii.
More people are going to day parties to turn up and opting out of spending thousands on bottle service in a VIP section at the club. Milan, who calls herself the "Fairy Vibe Mother," has the best seat in the house to observe the outfits of the masses.
"Everyone comes dressed how they want to dress. There are no obligations to look a certain way," Milan said. "I do see a big shift in how people (show up). They're still going to come dressed to the nines, but it's going to be more comfortable than being uncomfortable to impress people."
But "there's still a balance of women who are still dressing up," Milan said. When the ladies don't wear heels, their vintage designer bags or sunglasses are the moment.
There has been a significant shift in fashion within the nightlife scene over the years, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, women are embracing a more effortless aesthetic, leaning more into their cool girl chic era. Kitten heels and wedges are hot picks. Sneakers and ballerina flats are in.
But when the "it girls" spin the block on the business casual style, which has made a comeback in recent months, the approach is edgier and more rebellious compared to the 2010s.
"I think the older generations were made to feel like they had to suffer in a club with heels on," said Brown, who has worked with celebrities such as singer Halsey and actor Jordan E. Cooper. "The girls who are wearing the sneakers in the club got it right. They are not sacrificing the fun for the shoe."
She added: "They're merging the 2000s with quiet luxury, which is interesting."
According to market research cited by CNN, high-heel sales dipped drastically in 2020. Since then, brands like Crocs have seen major wins in customer demand. Due to the economy and other factors like remote work and the rise in fast fashion, shopping habits have evolved. Many women on a tight budget will only spend coin on high heels − especially if it's designer − if there is a special occasion.
"Women will definitely invest in a fabulous high-heeled shoe, as long as there's a reason for her to wear it," said Vasilios Christofilakos, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "Prior to the pandemic, when there wasn't a reason," they bought it because "they loved it."
"I noticed today that even in the big department stores, women are not going to have 25 boxes around them," he continued. "Most of the time, I see women buying shoes for work."
Now, less is more and women are expressing their femininity in their own unique way.
"One thing that I love that the discourse tipped towards was how women don't dress up for the male gaze," Parrish said. "We're not dressing up for the men. We're dressing up for what makes us feel our best."
