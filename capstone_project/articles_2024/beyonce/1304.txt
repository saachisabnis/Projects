Jermaine Dupri is less than pleased about the glaring omission of R&B on Apple Music’s newly-released list of the 100 Best Albums.
Beginning on May 13 with albums 100-90, Apple has been rolling out their list daily, with the top 10 still yet to be revealed. In a press release, the company described the list as an “editorial statement, fully independent of any streaming numbers” on its platform and “a love letter to the records that have shaped the world music lovers live and listen in.”
In numbers 20 through 11, names among the likes of Taylor Swift, JAY-Z, Dr. Dre and Adele make appearances, but JD couldn’t help but notice there just aren’t a lot of R&B names throughout the full 90 that have been unveiled.
“Looking at this @AppleMusic top 100 albums list is sad, the disrespect to R&B is CRAZY!!!!! It’s giving not worthy [face palm emoji]” he wrote in a post to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (May 21).

Some of the R&B albums on the list are Usher’s Confessions (#95), Solange’s A Seat at the Table (#93), Mary J. Blige’s My Life (#86), SZA’s SOS (#72), Erykah Badu’s Baduizm (#64), Sade’s Love Deluxe (#61), D’Angelo’s Voodoo (#57), Janet Jackson’s Control (#42), Beyoncé’s self-titled LP (#36), and Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On (#17).

Never one to hold his tongue, last month Jermaine Dupri called out the person who created a fake Kendrick Lamar diss song using AI.
The So So Def founder took to X (formerly Twitter) to react to Sy The Rapper outing himself as the mastermind behind the viral track, which contained shots at Drake and J. Cole.

Alongside a screenshot of a Complex headline that reads: “How a 23-Year-Old From LA Fooled The Internet With an AI Kendrick Lamar Diss Track,” Dupri added his own unfiltered commentary.
“This is the dumbest most irresponsible thing I’ve seen in years, Hip Hop is too dangerous and Hip Hop has always gone against fake shit,” he wrote.

The fake song, titled “One Shot,” initially surfaced online on April 15, although it was immediately met with skepticism from listeners.
DJ Dahi, who has worked extensive with Kendrick Lamar, tweeted: “Man we live in a weird time, AI diss tracks!! we need Google authentications to make sure all this shit is real or not lol.”

The confusion was settled the following day when Sy The Rapper posted a video on social media showing how he made the song.
In his interview with Complex, Sy said he thought it would be obvious that the track was fake.

“I thought people were going to know that it was AI,” he said. “Although it did sound real, it sounded like an old version of Kendrick Lamar.
“It didn’t sound like his more up-to-date style, at least in my opinion. The style sounded kind of dated, so I just thought that would be a giveaway, but apparently it wasn’t.”

“I was going to make a Drake track first, but his track leaked, and I didn’t really get around to doing it,” he added, referencing Drizzy’s “Push Ups.”
