In Arizona, former President Trump returned to one of his signature campaign promises — building a wall along the U.S. southern border. Speaking in Cochise County, AZ, Trump’s appearance was part of a plan to pull attention away from Harris and the DNC as he highlighted an area where Democrats are seen as vulnerable.

TikTok now wants a “special master” appointed to sift through the government’s classified materials about the app.
