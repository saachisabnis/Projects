Country music star Jelly Roll and alternative rocker/rapper Machine Gun Kelly are gearing for an epic collaboration. 
The surprising duo made the announcement on Thursday (July 18) in a joint Instagram post, letting fans know that their new track "Lonely Road" will drop July 26 and giving a sneak peek into the wild music video which features what appears to be a funeral scene, the "Mainstream Sellout" artist being thrown against a cop car and Jelly Roll kissing his wife Bunnie Xo.
The post also included a snippet of the soon-to-be-released song, featuring an obvious nod to John Denver's hit song "Take Me Home (Country Roads)" as mgk sings, "lonely road take me home, take me home, lonely road."
"countdown to KellyRoll activated," the caption states, also sending a shoutout to the legendary "Rocky Mountain High" singer. "thanks to John Denver for paving the way."
Fans of both artists couldn't contain their excitement for the upcoming collab, flooding the comments with messages like "this song will change the world," "y'allternative folks have entered the chat" and "instant jaw drop, this is gonna be incredible i already knowwww it" while others noted that "mgk's country era is here."
Of course, mgk wouldn't be the first artist known for his work in a different genre to swerve into the country music lane. Post Malone recently teamed up with Luke Combs to "shut down" Music City and has made surprise appearances with other country stars, while Beyonc√©, who dropped her highly-lauded country album COWBOY CARTER earlier this year.
