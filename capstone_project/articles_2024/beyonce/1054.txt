50 Cent has questioned Nicki Minaj coming in at number four on the list of highest grossing Hip Hop tours.
Complex recently ranked the recent swath of hugely successful Hip Hop tours based on ticket sales, with Drake topping the list with his It’s All a Blur Tour, which grossed a staggering $320 million.

Travis Scott came in second with his Circus Maximus Tour bringing in $154 million, while Kendrick Lamar was third thanks to the $110 million generated by his Big Steppers Tour.
However, there’s controversy over the next two spots with Nicki Minaj and 50 Cent both pulling in $108 million with their respective global treks.

50 took issue with the figures, commenting on Instagram: “I don’t know where they got these numbers from but they are wrong @nickiminaj would be in the 3rd slot. She worked hard as a mother man don’t do that. She did 2 legs on the Gagg city tour.”
Nicki herself also appeared to dispute the results, writing on X (formerly Twitter): “Show me the data.”

The financials for the list came from Touring Data who reported that Minaj’s Pink Friday 2 World Tour generated $108.8 million from 786,840 tickets across 70 shows.
The figures mean Nicki is the first female rapper to gross over $100 million from a single tour, and just the fifth Black woman to surpass the mark following Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Tina Turner.

50’s own Final Lap Tour fell just a few hundred thousand dollars short of Nicki’s, pulling in $108.4 million from 96 dates, per Touring Data.
