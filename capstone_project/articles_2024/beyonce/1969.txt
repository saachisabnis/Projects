A recent poll of 2,000 adults has revealed that Brits believe Michelle Obama, Bill Gates or Arnold Schwarzenegger would make the best next president of the United States, suggesting that celebrities possess more charisma than career politicians.
The study found that 34 per cent of adults believe celebrities with large platforms have a 'duty' to share their political views. A total of 50 per cent also believe that a celebrity's social media presence could provide them with an edge in an election.
A spokesperson from Lottoland, which commissioned the survey, commented: "The US is home to many popular faces. As recent history has shown, celebrity and political power in the USA has become even more inter-linked, with Arnie being governor of California - and of course, Donald Trump becoming president.
"But this has historical precedence too, former president Ronald Reagan who was in power in the 1980s, was a former actor too."
A total of 34 per cent think a celebrity's fame better qualifies them to connect with voters, compared to a career politician. Citing that they can bring charisma to a political role that regular politicians may lack.
When considering the top job, 75 per cent believe leadership is the most important attribute a candidate needs. This is followed by decisiveness (69 per cent), integrity (68 per cent) and communication skills (67 per cent).
A spokesperson from Lottoland commented: "It's really interesting to see how many Brits are so invested in US politics. It shows how our cultures are blending into one."
