The Celebrity Beat…
Don’t expect Billie Eilish to put on a three-hour show like Taylor Swift or Beyoncé.  She calls that, quote, “literally psychotic.”
She adds, quote, “Nobody wants that.  You guys don’t want that.  I don’t want that.  I don’t even want that as a fan.  My favorite artist in the world, I’m not trying to hear them for three hours.”
Billie didn’t call out anyone by name, and it should be noted that she previously complimented Taylor and Beyoncé for their massive stadium shows.
She called them “untouchable superstars” and said, quote, “The fact that they can put on a show that long, and it’s filled with so many incredible moments, is really amazing.”
