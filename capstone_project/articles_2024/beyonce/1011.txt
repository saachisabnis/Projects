The list of accolades Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron Jamesâ€”the NBA's all-time leading scorerâ€”has not earned in his illustrious career is short. However, one in particular sticks in his craw, as James is set to reveal on a forthcoming episode of The Shop, .
"Defensive Player of the Year," James said in a clip posted to social media Tuesday morning. "I mean, that's the only award that I don't have in my house."
James has been runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year twice. In 2009 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he finished second to Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard in a landslide. In 2013, by a much narrower margin, he finished second to Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol while with the Miami Heat.
"It don't make sense." ðŸ˜¤@KingJames talks about the one award he hasn't won and why it still stings in an all-new episode of #TheShop â€“ dropping this Thursday. pic.twitter.com/Rqh4L7fQ2L
"It kind of stings. I've talked about this before," James said. "It's almost what (Jay-Z) said about (BeyoncÃ©). How could she have the most Grammys, but never won Album of the Year?"
James noted that Gasolâ€”his teammate on the Lakers in 2021â€”was not nominated first team All-Defense the year he won Defensive Player of the Year.
