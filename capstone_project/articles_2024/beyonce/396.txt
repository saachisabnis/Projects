TL;DR: Gift this Apple Watch travel charger with 57% savings — there are only 50 left!
Even Queen Bey has to deal with the sucky battery life of her beloved Apple Watch. In the same way a dead battery cuts off our “Single Ladies” jam sessions, she’s dealing with it in a rehearsal. But there’s a quick fix that would make a perfect holiday gift.
This portable Apple Watch charger gives you or your giftee a quick power boost without needing outlets or pesky cords. You could be a better gift-giver than Jay-Z! They’re only $29.99 (reg. $69.95), but order now because we only have 50 available.
We doubt Beyoncé even owns one of these gadgets yet, so your giftee can be the envy of the world’s biggest pop star. All they have to do is charge it up and keep it in a pocket, bag, or on a keychain to be prepared for when their watch inevitably dies.
Just like their wireless Apple Watch charger at home, they’ll set the watch onto the charging pad to get a power boost — they’ll be back to playing Cowboy Carter in no time! The gadget holds enough battery to charge the watch several times from dead before needing to be recharged. 
Plus, if your gift recipient is ever really in a pinch, the gadget can work as an emergency iPhone charger with its built-in USB-C port. Imagine they’re stuck on the subway with a dead phone — this can get them enough battery to listen to “Halo” on repeat or text someone to let them know they’ll be home late.
Order this Apple Watch gift for $29.99 (reg. $69.95) before we sell out! There are only 50 available at this price.
