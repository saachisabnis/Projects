Vanessa Bryant has found strength in her surviving daughters since the devastating loss of her husband, Kobe Bryant, and daughter, Gianna, in 2020. Amid the profound tragedy, Vanessa has steadfastly worked to honor their legacy, and her daughter Natalia has grown into a remarkable young woman embodying her father's spirit.
Although the model has shared on multiple occasions how she is embracing the Mamba mentality, Vanessa's recent heartfelt photo of herself and Natalia on Instagram, captioned "Copy/Paste ❤️😘," highlights the striking similarities between the two. Fans have long noted that Natalia bears a physical resemblance to her mother. "Literally copy + paste!! Best caption🤣," a follower wrote, with a second adding, "Two beauties."
Now 21 years old, Natalia is a senior at the University of Southern California, balancing her rigorous film school studies with a thriving modeling career. Signed with IMG Models in 2021, Natalia is making waves in the fashion industry while pursuing her dream of becoming a director.
In January 2024, Natalia shared with Town & Country her feelings about seeing murals of her father and sister while moving around Los Angeles. According to Kobe's eldest daughter, seeing street art can be bittersweet, but she still appreciates the love. “I love seeing the murals. Whenever I see them when I’m driving around, I’m like, ‘Oh, okay.’ They feel like special gems,” she told the publication.
Natalia said she is always giving the best.  “In terms of legacy, my main goal is simply to be the best version of myself that I can be,” she says. Also, “understanding that there’s no expectation that I should have for each stage of life. I just need to know that I have to keep learning because there’s no finish line. You just have to keep pushing and being the best person you can be and soaking everything up like a sponge… The job’s never done.”
Natalia keeps herself busy while building a career. In the summer of 2023, she interned for Beyoncé‘s Parkwood Entertainment and helped to create the visuals of the Renaissance World tour. “It was such an amazing experience,” she told the outlet. “You can just talk to anybody in the office, and they’re amazing.”
