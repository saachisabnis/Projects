Kamala Harris brought out so many famous people to endorse her ... sorry, let me start over.¬†
Kamala Harris PAID so many famous people to endorse her which only really proved to Americans that she was not only clueless about what we were all going through but completely out of touch with normal, everyday voters. I'm not sure when Democrats decided it was a good idea to pretend brain-trusts like Cardi B reading her so-called endorsement from a cellphone would somehow convince Americans to vote blue but I'm SO GLAD they did. Seriously. Don't get me wrong, Trump ran a strong campaign and really had his finger on the pulse of what's been happening in this country HOWEVER, Team Doofus aka Team Kamala really did us quite a few favors in that sham of a campaign. Beyond Walz (woof, was THAT ever stupid), lying to voters about Beyonc√© performing to attract them to one of her rallies was really just stupid.
Especially now that even pollsters are starting to figure out Americans don't really care what celebrities think politically.
I know, super shocking, RIGHT?!

And here I thought I couldn't make a political decision without seeing what Mark Hamill thought first.¬†
Ha.
HA ha.
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
Sorry, I just have to laugh about Hamill. The guy is such an uninformed, sad, ignorant, crazy mess. That story about his son's girlfriend and how he tried to force her to have an abortion? I'm not even making that up!
Honestly, I think what really nuked Hollywood politics was 2020 when they sang 'Imagine' from their mansions while the rest of us were stuck at home losing our jobs, watching our kids miss school, unable to attend church or even get our hair cut. Oh, and they released it like they were doing us a favor. SURE, you can't be with your elderly parents as they die and no, you can't even bury them and have a funeral BUT here's us singing a super-cliched song.
YOU'RE WELCOME, PLEEBS.
Yeah, I don't know about you guys but I am seriously still pissed about it.
Ricky Gervais said it best:‚ÄúIf you do win an award tonight, don‚Äôt use it as a platform to make a political speech. You‚Äôre in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world.‚Äùpic.twitter.com/6kNx9hPCRG
Ricky really was ahead of the game here.

I really just don't get the Swiftie thing, but that's another article.

Republicans figured this out long ago and now Democrats are starting to learn their lesson as well.¬†
Slowly and painfully.
Gotta love it.
