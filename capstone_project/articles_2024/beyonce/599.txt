It was love at first sight for Muse singer Matt Bellamy and his wife, Elle Evans.
The couple met while filming the music video for his song “Mercy” in 2015 and have been together ever since. Evans supported Bellamy and his band when they won Best Rock Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards. He returned the favor one year later by attending a screening of Evans’ movie Muse.
In December 2017, the couple announced their engagement via Instagram after “one of the most romantic holiday [sic] of our lives” in Fiji. “After tears of joy, gasps of shock, and a split second of disbelief, of course – I said YES!” Evans gushed at the time.
Bellamy and Evans tied the knot in August 2019 in an outdoor ceremony in Malibu, announcing less than one year later that they were expecting their first baby together. Daughter Lovella Dawn was born in June 2020. (Bellamy previously welcomed son Bingham with his ex Kate Hudson in 2011.)
The family of three grew even bigger in May 2024 when Evans gave birth to son George Julien-Wade. “So grateful to my wonderfully perfect husband for being so supportive & by my side every step of the way!” Evans wrote via Instagram at the time.
