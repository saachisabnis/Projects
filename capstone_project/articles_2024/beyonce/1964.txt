The race for the White House remained essentially a dead heat on Sunday -- with nine days to go until Election Day.
Former President Donald Trump delivered a speech Sunday afternoon at New York's Madison Square Garden. After making several stops in Philadelphia on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally there Sunday afternoon.
Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on Monday's episode of NFL player and TV host Shannon Sharpe's "Club Shay Shay" podcast to criticize former President Donald Trump as "full time focused on himself."
Trump, Harris said, is "somebody who has never been understanding of the issues that affect the community about disparities," accusing the former president of having "denied rent to Black families" when he was a landlord and noting his "full page ad in the New York Times against the Central Park Five.""Don't think you're in Donald Trump's club," Harris continued. "He's not gonna be thinking about you.""He'll spend full time talking about his grievances, about what everyone has done to him," Harris said of Trump's rallies. "He'll talk about himself, but he does not talk about the American people."-ABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Will McDuffie
Former President Barack Obama appeared on a Zoom call with the group Win With Black Men on Sunday.The group -- which raised $1.3 million in four hours for the grassroots platform on behalf of the Harris campaign -- warned of the dangers of being apathetic as Black men and the importance of staying engaged in politics."Donald Trump has shown utter disrespect and disregard for our communities, and for Black men specifically, throughout his career,” Obama said.Drawing from former First Lady Michelle Obama’s Saturday Harris campaign speech, Obama expressed disbelief that the race is neck and neck.
"As my wife said yesterday, some of you I'm sure, caught her speech in Kalamazoo. It shouldn't be this close, because the candidates are not comparable. You have on the one hand, Donald Trump, somebody who, as president of the United States, showed contempt for huge sections of the country, who did not show the capacity to move legislation that actually helped ordinary people,” Obama said.“And on the other side, you've got Kamala Harris, who at every stage, has shown herself to be a champion of ordinary people, who works to provide a voice for folks who need it," Obama continued."Who has displayed consistent excellence at every level, from being a district attorney to being an attorney general of California to being a U.S. senator and now to being vice president, she is as qualified as any presidential nominee that we've ever seen, and her message is directly focused on the challenges that we face as black men, and that our communities face and that America faces," Obama said of Harris.Obama also debunked the notion that Trump is worth voting for because of the stimulus checks sent out during the pandemic.“Well, during the pandemic, Trump sent us a check. You know what? First of all, it was Congress and Democrats and Republicans who sent you a check, just like Joe Biden, working with Congress, sent you a check during the pandemic emergency relief, just like I sent emergency relief to people during the Great Recession when I first came into office -- the difference is that Joe Biden and I did not put our names on the check," Obama said."So do not think that somehow, because you got a check from Donald Trump, quote, unquote, during the pandemic, that somehow that's something special that he did, and that justifies you giving him his vote," Obama said.-ABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced on Sunday that "Virginia will be filing an appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court immediately," after the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Friday ruling halting Virginia's voter purge.For the second time in a week, the law was found to be in violation of the 90-day quiet period in the National Voting Rights Act of 1993. Since Aug. 1, 600 voters have been removed from the rolls.The 4th Circuit judges concluded that Gov. Glenn Youngkin's executive order to purge voters from the voter roll on a daily basis was systematic and therefore in violation of the NVRA.Ryan Snow, one of the lawyers in the case, told ABC News on Sunday, "It should be crystal clear to Governor Youngkin that it is illegal to remove eligible citizens from the rolls just days before the election. We urge the Supreme Court to stop this madness and make it clear that it is unacceptable to block eligible citizens from voting."-ABC News' Beatrice Peterson
Some of former President Donald Trump's advisers have proposed a plan, should he win the election, that would allow Trump to grant security clearances to a large number of his appointees without using the traditional background check process by the FBI, according to a memo described to ABC News that has circulated among his top aides.The proposal in the memo -- which has circulated among a small group and is being promoted in part by Trump's top legal adviser Boris Epshteyn -- would essentially allow Trump to quickly install a group of loyalists without them being subject to the typical FBI background checks, according to sources.The New York Times first reported the news.It proposes using investigators in the private sector to conduct background checks instead of the FBI, and would clear the way for Trump to essentially install a large number of his political appointees on Day 1 on the basis they'd been approved to receive classified briefings, sources said.The approach would raise significant questions about safeguards that could be bypassed as a result of such an approach, which runs contrary to how typical presidential transition operations have sought to prepare personnel for higher-level posts in an administration.Some of Trump's advisers have a complicated history with background checks and therefore distrust the vetting process typically undertaken by the FBI. It's unclear how many people the alleged proposal in the memo would apply to, but people familiar with it say it would cover a huge portion of Trump's political appointees.-ABC News' Katherine Faulders, Will Steakin and John Santucci
Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico "a floating island of garbage" at former President Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, faces growing backlash from Republicans — including Trump's own campaign.“This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign," Trump campaign's senior adviser Danielle Alvarez wrote in a statement to ABC News.Senate Republican Rick Scott — who has long supported statehood for Puerto Rico — also wrote on X that the joke was not funny and “bombed for a reason," while House Republican Maria Salazar said on the platform that she was “disgusted” by Hinchcliffe’s rhetoric, which " does not reflect GOP values."The Republican Party of Puerto Rico also denounced Tony Hinchcliffe's comments in a statement on Sunday, with party chair Angel Cintrón writing that they were "unfortunate, ignorant, and entirely reprehensible."He added that the comments do not represent the values of any Puerto Ricans, Democrat or Republican, on the island or throughout the United States.Notably, while Puerto Rico does not vote for president in the general election, since it is a U.S. territory, the Republican Party of Puerto Rico held a primary in April as part of its presidential nominating process. That primary was won by Donald Trump, who netted the territory's delegates.Hinchcliffe has not yet issued a formal response as the GOP distances itself from him.He did, however, quickly reply to Tim Walz when the Democratic governor of Minnesota called him a "jackwad," writing on X, “These people have no sense of humor. Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his 'busy schedule' to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist.”Hinchcliffe continued, “I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone…watch the whole set. I’m a comedian Tim…might be time to change your tampon.”The controversy is not a first for Hinchcliffe, who has a history of making racially charged jokes.In 2021, he came under fire after calling fellow comedian Peng Dang racist names in a mocking Chinese accent. It was during a Big Laugh Comedy show in Austin, Texas, where Dang had just introduced Hinchcliffe to the stage after doing a series of jokes related to #StopAsianHate. During the set, Hinchcliffe reportedly further made racist jokes against Chinese people.After the incident, Hinchcliffe was reportedly removed from his agency, WME, and dropped from a scheduled episode on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He was also reportedly forced to cancel several upcoming shows.-ABC News' Lalee Ibssa, Soorin Kim, Oren Oppenheim and Kelsey Walsh
While Trump started his speech with "a message of hope," he quickly went into his usual stump speech, disparaging immigrants and emphasizing a campaign promise to enact mass deportations on "Day 1.""On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail. They kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible," Trump said.
Trump then promised to deliver the death penalty for migrants who kill Americans or police officers."I'm here by calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer," Trump said.Calling on supporters to turn out on Election Day, Trump said, "With your help, from now until Election Day, we will restore America's promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we all love."-ABC News' Lalee Ibssa
While speaking to his crowd of supporters at Madison Square Garden Sunday, former President Donald Trump suggested a bill be created to punish anyone who burns an American flag with a year in jail.
"I would like to suggest that we put in a bill that if you burn the American flag -- one year in jail," Trump said.Flag burning is not illegal in the U.S. because it is protected by the First Amendment as a form of symbolic speech.
Former President Donald Trump renewed his previous comments suggesting political opponents are a threat to the U.S., calling them "enemies from within.""When I say 'the enemy within,' the other side goes crazy," Trump said Sunday on the Madison Square Garden stage. "They have done very bad things, they are indeed the enemy from within," he said.
Trump previously floated the rhetoric during an appearance on Fox News earlier this month."I think the bigger problem are the people from within," Trump told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo, claiming Democrats are more of a threat to the 2024 presidential election than top foreign adversaries such as China and Russia."We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics," Trump said at the time.Trump suggested deploying the military against them on American soil, arguing without proof they would be more likely to sow chaos on Nov. 5 than his supporters -- despite what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021."I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen," Trump told Bartiromo.
During his campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, former President Donald Trump attacked FEMA and the Biden-Harris administration's hurricane response.He called their response to Hurricane Helene "egregious" and "the worst response in North Carolina and other states since Katrina.""They haven't even responded in North Carolina. There's nobody, they don't see any FEMA," Trump falsely claimed about the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Turning his attention to illegal immigration, the former president again repeated falsehoods about Springfield, Ohio."You take a look at Springfield, Ohio," he said, "... where 30,000 illegal migrants were put into a town of 50,000 people."
During former President Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Sunday, the DNC projected artwork that reads "Trump = Unhinged," "Trump Praised Hitler," "Trump = Unfit," "Trump = Unstable" and "Trump = Cheat."
