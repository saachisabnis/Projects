In a groundbreaking moment for the music industry, Beyoncé has set a new Grammy record, becoming the most-nominated artist in history. Her latest album, Cowboy Carter, earned her 11 Grammy nominations for the 2025 awards, bringing her career total to 99. With nods in multiple categories, including country and Americana for the first time, Beyoncé continues to redefine genre boundaries and expand her influence.
Released to critical acclaim, Cowboy Carter is nominated for Album of the Year and Best Country Album, making Beyoncé the first Black woman in the 21st century to compete for Album of the Year in a country category. “This is a career-defining moment,” said Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “Beyoncé’s work is genre-defying, and her recognition across so many categories reflects the Academy’s efforts to represent all music styles.”
Her single “Texas Hold ’Em” is up for Record and Song of the Year as well as Best Country Song. Beyoncé also received her first nomination in the Americana category for the song “Ya Ya.” In addition, her collaboration with Post Malone, “Levii’s Jeans,” is up for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Seven songs from Cowboy Carter have been nominated, underscoring the album’s wide-reaching appeal across pop, country, and melodic rap categories.
The nominations are especially significant given the historical lack of Black representation in country music categories. Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter showcases her distinct take on country music, which she describes as a journey to “bend and blend genres.” In an Instagram post, she reflected on her early experiences in country music: “I did not feel welcomed…but I challenged myself and created this body of work.”
With her nominations, Beyoncé could become the first Black woman to win a Grammy for a country song. The recognition comes after she was notably overlooked at the 2024 Country Music Association Awards, despite topping charts with her genre-blending album. “Beyoncé is helping to shape the future of country music,” Mason Jr. added, crediting her for shining a light on the genre’s Black roots.
The 2025 Grammy Awards will air live on February 2 from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, promising an evening of historic milestones and, possibly, a long-awaited Album of the Year win for Beyoncé.
