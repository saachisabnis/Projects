Chrissy Teigen isn't shying away from the scars on her body, boldly showing off the surgical reminders left behind from various cosmetic procedures.
The Cravings cookbook author and her husband, John Legend, attended BeyoncÃ© and JAY-Z's Gold Oscars afterparty at Chateau Marmont on Sunday (March 10), with Teigen sharing photos of their matching looks on Instagram. The "All of Me" crooner was dashing in black shirt, bowtie and suit with gold embroidery around his shoulders, while Teigen looked stunning in a sheer black corset-style dress with an embroidered skirt by Jasmin Erbas, per Entertainment Tonight. The structured black bodice of the gown was so sheer that it showed off the scars from her breast lift.
"When the flash hits your boob lift scars ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥," she captioned the photos, hilariously adding in the comments, "You're all zooming I can feel it!!!"
The mom of four has been open in the past about undergoing various cosmetic procedures, such as liposuction and removing fat from her cheeks, and breast augmentation surgeries. She even recently shared in an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen that she has undergone three different procedures, revealing, "I've had a lift, a put in and a take them out. I don't like them out."
