The nine-minute song features lush production and loved-up vocals and harmonies from D’Angelo, who hasn’t released any new material since 2019.
JAY-Z contributes a spoken word-style guest verse that finds him waxing poetic about the apple of his own eye: “Life don’t taste the same without you/ Tears in my champagne ’bout you/ Quit playin’ girl, you know I’m crazy ’bout you.”

He also raps: “Luther songs looped up in my head/ Love you for my life and I put that on my dead/ Put that on my daddy’s new porch, cigarettes/ He blew cancer rings, I got toxic traits.”
Listen to the track below.
“I Want You Forever” was previously teased by Jeymes Samuel, who said during a screening for The Book of Clarence: “It’s so deep. D’Angelo and JAY-Z on the same track. [It’s] 9 minutes, 33 seconds of absolute soulful biblical bliss.”
The Roc Nation mogul also discussed the making of the track on an X Spaces event to promote the film on Thursday (January 11).

“As far as this song, it was just a feeling,” he said. “I didn’t wanna stop there actually. I didn’t wanna stop where I stopped. I was in Paris at the time and it was just a beautiful time, and I think [Beyoncé] was rehearsing for her tour.”
He added: “I didn’t wanna stop there. It was like, okay, let me put a placeholder in there saying, ‘Finish this.’ You listen to it and you vibe to it and it’s like, ‘You know what? It’s complete.'”

On the subject of lengthy verses, JAY-Z also revealed during the broadcast that his acclaimed four-minute verse on DJ Khaled’s “God Did” was not planned.
“It’s really the song that dictates the vibe of what’s going on. I didn’t start out to do ‘God Did’ as a four-minute verse. That’s not how it happened,” he explained.
