In recent years, maternity style has come a long way from being the boring section of your classic shopping destination. Long gone are the days when expectant mothers would be subject to strictly oversize plain dresses and sweatsuits. While comfort is priority during pregnancy, there's no reason to forsake personality, taste or style.
Perhaps it's the duo behind 2022's most memorable pregnancy announcement that changed maternity fashion forever, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. The couple, who are sartorial forces in their own right, took the world by storm when they created a New York-themed photoshoot to unveil the Fenty mogul's first baby bump with RiRi wearing a vintage pink Chanel puffer coat and low-rise jeans. This moment in time set a whole new standard for dressing while pregnant by showing that moms-to-be can have fun with their clothes.
It took no time for other famous mothers to adopt the "Work" singer's rewritten dress code of bump-baring silhouettes like crop tops and leather dresses. Recently, Hailey Bieber stepped out in a sheer floral catsuit layered under a long black leather coat and Vanessa Hudgens wore a see-through Alberta Ferretti dress at this year's Vanity Fair Oscar Party — both looks reminiscent of Rihanna's lace Christian Dior babydoll dress at Paris Fashion Week. Meanwhile, stars like Sofia Richie Grainge depict a more relaxed version of maternity dressing that's just as chic frequently rocking neutral loungewear and dainty frocks.
Ahead, see how the stars pushed the envelope while embracing their bumps, then get inspired to bring these style tricks into your own wardrobe for summer and beyond.
