Toni Cornell released her debut single on Thursday (November 21) after teasing it last week. "Sunset of Your Love" sees the singer, whose dad is the late Audioslave and Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell, mix haunting pop reminiscent of Lana Del Rey with wailing guitars her father would have loved.
Although she has yet to announce any more new music, Toni teased that it could be on the way. "There’s a lot more where this came from," she captioned an Instagram post announcing her song was officially out.
Fans flocked to the comments on Instagram and YouTube praising the 20-year-old's talent and reflecting on how her father would feel if he heard the song.
"Chris left us one hell of a gift!! Beautiful song, can’t wait for more!" one wrote on YouTube.
"I know your dad is smiling down at you with pride!!! I am so proud of you,Toni!!!" commented another on Instagram.
"Toni, your father would be so proud of you. This is such a beautiful song and you have an angelic voice," wrote another on YouTube.
"Sunset of Your Love" was written by MoZella, who co-wrote Miley Cyrus’ hit "Wrecking Ball," and produced by Dave Hamelin, who worked on Beyoncé’s Grammy-nominated single "16 Carriages." Listen to it below.
Although Toni refers to "Sunset of Your Love" as her "first song," she actually released a track called "Far Away Places" in 2019. She recorded that song, which features production from her late father, in 2017. He died three months later. In addition to original music, Toni's also cover a lot of popular songs. Her most famous is Sinead O'Connor's "Nothing Compares 2 U," which her dad loved to cover. In 2018, she released a duet with her dad for Father's Day.
