Dolly Parton just dropped a major bombshell.
In the past, she said she would LOVE it if Beyoncé would cover one of her songs, and Dolly thinks she has.
Dolly sat down with a local newspaper, Knox News, during the season opening of Dollywood and had some tea to dish out about Beyoncé.
When asked if Beyoncé was going to sing one of her songs on the upcoming “Act II” album, Dolly said,
“Well, I think she has! I think she’s recorded ‘Jolene’ and I think it’s probably gonna be on her country album, which I’m very excited about that.”
When asked what she thought of Beyoncé, Dolly said,
“I love her! She’s a beautiful girl and a great singer.”
2024 is already off to a wild start, and if Beyoncé drops a cover of “Jolene”, the country music world will never be the same again.
