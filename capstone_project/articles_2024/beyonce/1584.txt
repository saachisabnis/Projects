(KRON) — On Tuesday morning in Vallejo, a woman named Caroline was vibing to Beyoncé’s newest album, “Cowboy Carter,” as she drove to work. While she was waiting for a stoplight to change, the unexpected happened. A man smashed her passenger-side window and tried to take her bag.
After Caroline fought back for a few seconds, the suspect gave up and went back into his car. Caroline drove through the red light to safety.
