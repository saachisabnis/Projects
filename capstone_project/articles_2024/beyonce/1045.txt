Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet are reportedly still going strong more than a year after they were first romantically linked.
According to People, a source close to The Kardashians star said she and her actor beau are in a "very serious" relationship and finding time in their busy schedules to spend time together, adding that they are "just a great couple" and that "everyone loves them together.
"He's close with her family and she's close with his family," the source said. "It's very serious, but also a fun relationship."
Despite both being very busy with their respective careers, such as Chalamet currently filming his film Marty Supreme in New York City while Kardashian remains across the country in Los Angeles, they manage to make it work.
"They've really been able to figure out a good balance between working and spending quality time together," the source said.
The 27-year-old Kylie Cosmetics founder and 28-year-old Dune star were first linked in April 2023, but it wasn't until September 2023 that they seemingly publicly confirmed their relationship while attending Beyoncé's Renaissance world tour, and even shared a kiss while attending the Golden Globes earlier this year. They also reportedly vacationed in the Bahamas in August to celebrate the beauty mogul's 27th birthday, with a source telling People at the time that Jenner is "incredibly happy with him" and that "she's never been in love like this before."
