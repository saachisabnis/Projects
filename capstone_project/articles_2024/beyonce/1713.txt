Cameras also caught up with several of country music's most well-known couples. Here you'll find red carpet pics of Twain, Lambert, Ballerini, Machine Gun Kelly and more. Newcomers like Chase Matthew and Tanner Adell also worked the carpet early.
Long, elegant gowns dominated but you'll find more than a few women making daring dashes down the carpet in a short skirt, or less. As for the men, so far nobody has done anything too outrageous, but it's early.
The two-hour broadcast begins at 8PM ET and features performances from Urban, Lambert, Lady A, Kane Brown, Brad Paisley and more. Lambert and Brown are set to receive special honors. She'll be presented the Country Icon Award (which went to Wynonna Judd in 2023) and he'll receive the Country Champion Award.
In addition to Beyonce, Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves are among the most nominated artists. That trio isn't listed as performer or presenter, leaving in doubt if they'll make an appearance.
This gallery will be updated as more artists walk down the red carpet at the 2024 People's Choice Country Awards. Taste of Country will publish immediate results of awards and any memorable moments.
