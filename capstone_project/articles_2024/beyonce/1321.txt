	Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Carnival,” featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti, rises to No. 1, from No. 2, on the Billboard Hot 100. The song marks Ye’s fifth leader and Ty Dolla $ign’s second, as well as the first each for Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti.

	Meanwhile, Ye extends his span of career Hot 100 No. 1s to over 20 years, becoming the first rap artist to achieve the feat.

	Ye is also the first rapper ever to have topped the Hot 100 in three distinct decades (the 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s).

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated March 16, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, March 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	“Carnival,” which becomes the 1,165th No. 1 in the Hot 100’s 65-year history, drew 33.7 million streams (up 4%) and 3.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 85%) and sold 3,000 downloads (up 15%) in the March 1-7 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The single adds a third week atop the Streaming Songs chart and jumps 19-13 for a new high on Digital Song Sales.

	The track was released Feb. 10 on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album Vultures 1, on the former’s YZY label. The set, Ye’s first following a string of hate speech and antisemitic remarks, debuted at No. 1 on the Feb. 24-dated Billboard 200 chart and led for two weeks; it holds at No. 3 in its fourth week on the list.

	Here’s a deeper look at the song’s ascent to the Hot 100’s summit.

	Ye adds his fifth Hot 100 leader, as “Carnival” follows Katy Perry’s “E.T.,” on which he’s featured (five weeks at No. 1, beginning in April 2011); “Stronger” (one week, September 2007); “Gold Digger,” featuring Jamie Foxx (10 weeks, beginning in September 2005); and Twista’s  “Slow Jamz,” featuring Ye and Foxx (one week, February 2004).

	Ye completes his quickest run to No. 1 on the Hot 100 – four weeks – passing the seven-week flight of “E.T.”

	Ty Dolla $ign previously topped the Hot 100 for a week in June 2018 as featured on Post Malone’s “Psycho.”

	Ye ends the longest break between Hot 100 No. 1s (12 years and 10 months) since Brenda Lee went a record 63 years, one month and two weeks between “I Want to Be Wanted” in 1960 and her Yuletide standard “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” this past December. Among non-holiday hits, Ye wraps the longest gap between No. 1s since Coldplay waited 13 years, three months and two weeks between “Viva La Vida” in 2008 and “My Universe,” with BTS, in 2021.

	Ye has now led the Hot 100 in the 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s, becoming the only male to earn the honor. Overall, he joins Beyoncé, Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga for the feat over the three decades. (Carey gained inclusion thanks to commands each holiday season since 2019 with her 1994 classic carol “All I Want for Christmas Is You.”)

	Ye is also the first rapper ever to have topped the Hot 100 in any three distinct decades.

	From the first week at No. 1 on the Hot 100 for “Slow Jamz” through, now, the coronation of “Carnival,” Ye spans 20 years and one month of appearing atop the chart, as he becomes the first rapper to reach the 20-year milestone.

Longest Spans of Hot 100 No. 1s:

	Notably, “Carnival” dethrones Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” atop the Hot 100 – marking the first tradeoff at No. 1 ever among artists with over 20-year spans of leaders, excluding holiday music. (In the only other such instances, Carey, with “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” and Lee, with “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,” swapped spots at the apex twice over the latest holidays.)

	“Carnival” concurrently logs a second week week atop both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, which use the same multimetric methodology as the Hot 100.

	(Hot Rap Songs marks its 35th anniversary, having begun with the chart dated March 11, 1989.)

	Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” rebounds to its No. 2 Hot 100 high, from No. 5. It also jumps 3-1 for a second week atop Digital Song Sales (26,000, up 230%, sparked by a cappella and instrumental mixes released March 1 and a “Live at the Ryman” version, with Freak Freely, released March 5, while 11 versions of the song were discounted to a 69-cent sale price during the tracking week).

	Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, following six nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, as it notches an eighth week atop the Radio Songs chart (76.5 million, down 4%).

	Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” is steady at No. 4 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 3.

	Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” falls to No. 5 after two weeks atop the Hot 100. It leads the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a fourth week.

	Tate McRae’s “Greedy” rises 8-6 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 3.

	Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, keeps at No. 7 on the Hot 100, after it led for a week upon its debut last September. It tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts for a 28th week each.

	SZA’s “Snooze” bumps 9-8 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2, as it rules the multimetric Hot R&B Songs chart for a 31st week – surpassing her own “Kill Bill” for the longest command by a woman dating to the tally’s 2012 start.

	Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills” returns to the Hot 100’s top 10, lifting 12-9, after hitting No. 7.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” holds at No. 10, following four nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in October.
