There’s nothing like enjoying a refreshing Pepsi during NFL Kickoff… while waiting for Megan Thee Stallion’s MTV VMAs debut … as you preorder tickets for Paramount Pictures’ Gladiator II.
At least, that’s the message we’re getting from Pepsi’s new, loaded NFL ad.
With a total audience of 27.5 million on NBC last year, the National Football League’s season opener ranked among the Top 10 broadcasts overall in 2023 and had wider reach than any non-NFL event.
So this year, Pepsi and Paramount are treating it like the Super Bowl with a three-minute sports marketing hybrid ad touting multiple Pepsi products, the NFL players who appear on CBS Sports broadcasts, the host of the Paramount-owned 2024 MTV VMAs Megan Thee Stallion, and the Paramount Pictures sequel to the half-billion-dollar, five-Oscar 2000 epic Gladiator.
