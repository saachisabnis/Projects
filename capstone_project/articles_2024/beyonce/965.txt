Singer, songwriter and producer, Bradley Simpson has shared his debut single, "Cry At The Moon".
Bradley Simpson wrote "Cry At The Moon" with Andrew Wells (RAYE), Anthony Rossomando (The Libertines) and the two-time Grammy nominee Jordan Asher Cruz, better known as BOOTS (Beyoncé).
“‘Cry At The Moon’ started in LA early on in the writing process for the album with Anthony and Andrew. I knew I wanted to draw on influences I grew up on, and we spent the first two hours of the session listening through bands we loved, lots of Queens of the Stone Age and Raconteurs," he explains. "As the melody for the chorus came together, we built around that. It was exactly how I wanted to move forward with the sound of the album, and it opened the writing process for me. It became the catalyst for that sound as it went on a bit of a journey.
Bradley Simpson’s current solo headline tour sold-out in a matter of minutes and opened with a four night residency at London’s 100 Club. Previewing songs from the upcoming album, including "Cry At The Moon", the tour will continue with shows in LA and New York and, then more shows in Europe ahead of his first solo festival set at Latitude in July.
"Cry At The Moon" is out now via Insanity UK / Columbia Records.
