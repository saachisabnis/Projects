Some might say the holidays are for the kids. So I asked Adam Motz, who’s raising twins with his husband Tee Lam and together make up 2 Dads 2 Twins, for some gift ideas.
Adam: Our daughters really love their Magna Tiles, which are perfect for their age. We’ve also gotten a kick out of watching them load up their Target carts and Skip Hop backpacks before going into their personalized playhouse for imaginary adventures. Check out their other faves here.
Adam: Yeah! With our daughters growing up so fast, we asked some parents and teachers for future ideas. They said that this fort-building kit and remote-controlled truck are big hits with their own kids, while this Garfield Chia Pet and Stanley Jr. tool set are exciting and educational.
Adam: We rounded up some fun and affordable family games that we played growing up, and have been introducing them to our kids in an accessible way. I know they’re going to love Hungry Hungry Hippos, UNO, Jenga and Twister as they get older.
