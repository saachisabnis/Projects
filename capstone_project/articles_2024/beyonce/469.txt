Teyana Taylor shaded Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole with a Taylor Swift song in response to the sports analyst hinting at dressing up as her for Halloween after allegedly dating Iman Shumpert.
The “Gonna Love Me” singer, 33, took issue with Nicole’s comment that she was “famous at the time” as she detailed her many upcoming projects — including the Netflix film “Straw” and the Dionne Warwick biopic — in an Instagram post that featured Swift’s 2014 hit “Shake It Off.” 
“I know 2025 gone hate to see a Taylor coming!! ❤️‍🔥🌹🎥🎬🎞️ 💸,” the actress cheekily wrote in her caption on Friday.
Just hours later, Taylor minced no words when she more directly blasted Nicole, 32, for her remarks on Thursday’s episode of Angel Reese’s “Unapologetically Angel” podcast. 
During her interview, Nicole alluded to dressing up as Taylor — who she only referred to as a “singer/actress who was famous at the time” — after former New York Knicks player Shumpert allegedly dumped her via text.
“F–k the iman part, l’m divorced and happily so, however her choice of words were very distasteful and uncalled for,” the “Coming 2 America” actress reacted in a since-deleted comment on the Shade Room’s post about the interview. 
“She knew exactly what she was doing. That lady said ‘she was famous at the time’ [and] also said ‘idc who see it’ [and] it was very distasteful & uncalled for,” Taylor continued.
“Most importantly she knew people would dig.”
Though Nicole deleted the post showing off her Halloween costume, there are still photos on the internet of the fitness influencer dressed as Taylor from Kanye West’s 2016 “Fade” music video.
“I’m finding out just like the world that her intentions were ill and petty,” the mom of two added.
Taylor then accused Nicole of pulling “the black card when it came to Taylor Swift” and turning around and bullying her, a fellow black woman.
She even claimed she “showed love” on Nicole’s Halloween costume post a decade ago without realizing the intentions.
“Whole time I ain’t even know she was being shady,” Taylor wrote. “Now I do.”
“So in that case, petty panties on. I had my little fun, I said what I said, and now I’m done and headed back to set,” she concluded. 
Nicole seemingly responded to Taylor’s negative reaction on X Friday evening, writing, “Sometimes I’m asked about my personal life and decide to share the lessons I’ve learned.
“To reiterate what I said in the hour long interview — learn from my mistakes. If u watched in its entirety, you’d know I don’t condone the ‘crazy’ decision I made literally 10 YEARS AGO.”
Furthermore, Nicole appeared unbothered by all the noise on Saturday when she posted a video to her Instagram Story that showed her twirling her hair.
The lyrics of Beyoncé’s song “Formation” can be heard in the background: “You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation. Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper.”
Page Six reached out to her for further comment. 
Explaining her decision to dress up as Taylor, Nicole told Reese, 22, on “Unapologetically Angel” that she was “defeated” and “heartbroken” at the time.
“I dressed up as that lady for Halloween!” she exclaimed. “It went viral, it was everywhere.”
Nicole also said she wasn’t worried about internet sleuths connecting the dots, which they quickly accomplished. 
Taylor and Shumpert were married from 2016 to 2023 and share two daughters. 
They went Instagram-official in June 2014 when Taylor shared a PDA-filled beach snap on his birthday. 
Shumpert, 34, and Nicole were dating until at least December 2013, which is when he reshared a since-deleted throwback photo she posted. 
Nicole dated Kelce on and off between 2017 and 2022. He began dating Swift in summer 2023.
