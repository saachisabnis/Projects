Print takes to the Paris catwalk
Kyocera has collaborated with well-known Japanese fashion designer Kunihiko Morinaga to print textiles used in his show at Paris Fashion Week using its new ForEarth printer.
Morinaga is behind the Anrealage brand, “which recognises fashion as a tool to change everyday life”. He designed the stage costume for Beyoncé’s 2023 world tour.
Kyocera's eco-friendly and water-saving ForEarth printer was announced last year.
It is Kyocera’s first device for direct-to-fabric printing.
Explaining the concept behind his design, Morinaga said: “In this show, I tried to express the concept of ForEarth to reduce water usage in the form of clothes, and I showed a dress like a drop of water.
“Clothes are usually made to fit the human body, but I thought of the perfect sphere as the human body and made a frilly dress to wrap around the sphere. The dress itself looks like a drop of water when the sphere is wearing the dress, but when you peel it off the sphere, it turns into a dress that people wear.”
He said he was impressed at the results from the device.
“In all my years of making clothes, I thought it was natural to use a lot of water for prints, and I thought that using water would keep the colours, vibrant expression, and texture of the fabric. However, I was very impressed that the fabric printed with ForEarth achieves the vibrant and high-definition expression even though it uses very little water, and that the texture of the textile itself is not spoiled at all and the softness of the fabric was maintained.”
