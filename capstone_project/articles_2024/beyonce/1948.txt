	With her instantly recognizable warble, signature dance moves and singular stage presence, it didn’t take long for Shakira to reach icon status after she first found global fame with 2001’s Laundry Service. 

	More than two decades later, it’s now hard to imagine what the modern pop landscape would look like without the Colombian singer, especially considering the explosion in popularity other crossover Latin artists have experienced in her wake. She earned her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at the top of the millennium with “Whenever, Wherever,” which remains one of her biggest hits to date, and later scored her first-ever No. 1 single in 2006 with “Hips Don’t Lie,” featuring Wyclef Jean. 

	Since then, Shakira has scored more than two dozen entries on the chart, along with a handful of top 10 smashes. She’s also become one of the music world’s most in-demand duet partners, having teamed up with everyone from the Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna and Beyoncé to Maluma, Rauw Alejandro and Karol G. 

	From her high-energy hits as a breakout star to her still-fiery-but-more-mature bops, Shakira has kept fans singing, dancing and occasionally crying along for years — and she doesn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon. Keep reading to see her 20 biggest hits on the Hot 100 so far below.

Shakira’s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits ranking is based on weekly performance on the Hot 100 through June 15, 2024. Songs are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at lower spots earning the least. Due to changes in chart methodology over the years, eras are weighted differently to account for chart turnover rates during various periods.
