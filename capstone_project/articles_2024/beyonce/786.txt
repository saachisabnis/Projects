Lenny Kravitz also performed a kick-off show of fan favourites
Jay-Z was spotted at Wembley Stadium last night (June 1), where he was in the stands for the UEFA Champions League final.
The artist was in attendance to watch Real Madrid triumph over Dortmund in a 2-0 victory. The winning club’s Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior is signed to the sports division of Jay-Z’s management company Roc Nation, which he joined last year after it acquired TFM Agency.

The event also featured a performance by Lenny Kravitz, who performed shortened versions of three hits – ‘Fly Away’, ‘Human’ and ‘Are You Gonna Go My Way’ – as a six-minute medley on the pitch. Watch it below.
In April, Jay-Z’s Made In America Festival was cancelled for the second year in a row. No specific reason was given for it being shelved.
Launched in 2012, the annual two-day event traditionally takes place every Labor Day weekend on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and again last year “due to severe circumstances”.
The 2021 edition hosted headline performances by Justin Bieber and Lil Baby, with Bad Bunny and Tyler, The Creator topping the bill the following year. SZA and Lizzo had been scheduled to headline the axed 2023 festival, but no line-up details had been revealed for this year’s event.
Made In America Festival founder Jay-Z headlined the inaugural event in 2012 before topping the bill again in 2017. Other acts to have performed there include Jay’s wife Beyoncé, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Coldplay and Kings Of Leon.
Jay-Z also made the headlines earlier this year when his wife Beyoncé rewrote Dolly Parton‘s ‘Jolene’ lyrics to address him cheating on her.
‘Jolene’ now refers to someone trying to “come between a family and a happy man”, with Beyoncé singing in the chorus: “Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene / I’m warnin’ you, don’t come for my man / Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene / Don’t take the chance because you think you can”.
Beyoncé’s ‘Jolene’ cover, featured on her latest album ‘Cowboy Carter’, also sees her reaffirm her love with her husband, with whom she tied the knot in 2008, after having dated since roughly 2002: “We’ve been deep in love for twenty years / I raised that man, I raised his kids / I know my man better than he knows himself”.
The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.
