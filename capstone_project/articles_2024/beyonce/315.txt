Exclusive Interview
When crafting footwear that embodies luxury, elegance, and empowerment, Flor de Maria Rivera stands as a force to be reckoned with. As the Founder, Designer, and Creative Director of Flor de Maria, she has built a brand that graces the feet of global icons like Shakira, Kylie Jenner, and Nicki Minaj and tells a story of resilience, passion, and authenticity. Known for her intricate attention to detail and commitment to timeless designs, Flor has solidified her place in the competitive world of high-fashion footwear. In this exclusive interview, she opens up about her journey, her creative process, and what drives her to keep breaking barriers as a Latina designer in the luxury fashion industry.
From designing Mariah Carey's dazzling red sandals for her Christmas Time tour to seeing her creations shine on shows like "And Just Like That," Flor's career combines the power of vision and hard work. Her creations are more than just shoes; they're works of art crafted with purpose and infused with meaning. Each pair carries her signature style—a harmonious blend of sophistication, comfort, and show-stopping appeal. Whether it's bold embellishments for Nicki Minaj or understated elegance for Eva Longoria, Flor has mastered the art of tailoring her designs to reflect the unique essence of her clients.
Flor's Peruvian heritage is at the heart of her creative vision, inspiring her brand's vibrant colors, bold patterns, and meticulous craftsmanship. Yet, her designs transcend borders, celebrating women from all walks of life. "I design for women around the world," Flor shares. "It's about creating shoes that make them feel powerful, elegant, and confident, no matter where they're from." This universal appeal has earned her a place alongside renowned luxury brands on international red carpets, magazine covers, and the wardrobes of A-list celebrities.
In this conversation, Flor takes us behind the scenes of her design process, offering a glimpse into the artistry that brought Mariah Carey's holiday shoes to life. She also shares her thoughts on upcoming trends, sustainability in fashion, and her advice for aspiring designers. Whether you're a shoe lover, a fashion enthusiast, or someone inspired by stories of entrepreneurial grit, Flor de Maria's journey will surely leave a lasting impression.
The design of Mariah's red sandals was all about capturing the magic and glamour that she brings to the stage during her holiday performances. I wanted the shoes to embody the essence of Christmas—the joy, the sparkle, and the larger-than-life energy that Mariah represents. From the very beginning, I worked closely with Mariah's stylist, Wilfredo Rosado, to ensure every detail was perfect. The shoes are crafted from luxurious silk satin and adorned with over 10,000 hand-applied crystals, all meticulously placed to catch the light and reflect the holiday spirit. This collaboration was a dream come true, especially since I've been a lifelong fan of Mariah's music. Her iconic presence and grace were key elements in designing shoes that truly complemented her unique style.
My journey began with a deep love for shoes—I collected over 500 pairs. Still, I could never find that perfect balance of high-end style, luxury quality, comfort, and versatility all in one shoe without the excessive markup. I knew I wanted to design a shoe with all those qualities in just one pair. I set out to create footwear that wasn't just beautiful but also luxury at attainable prices, empowering women to feel confident, glamorous, and comfortable at the same time. I wanted to design shoes that seamlessly transition from day to night, offering elegance and practicality without compromising on craftsmanship or design.
After years of hard work, sacrifice, and staying fiercely true to my vision for Flor de Maria, I've been fortunate enough to see my designs worn by global icons like Shakira and Kylie Jenner. This is proof that when you stay focused on your passion, trust your instincts, and believe in your vision, you can turn your dreams into something real and make a powerful impact along the way.
Growing up in Peru, I was deeply influenced by my culture's vibrant colors, bold patterns, and rich craftsmanship. This passion for beauty and detail flows into every shoe I create. For me, each design carries a feeling, a story—it's not just about style but about infusing emotion and energy into every piece. While my heritage shapes my vision, I design for women worldwide. I want my shoes to reflect all women's strength, elegance, and confidence—blending sophistication with a touch of boldness. It's about creating something timeless that empowers and celebrates every woman, no matter where she's from.
When I'm designing for someone as high-profile as Mariah Carey, my process starts with listening—understanding their vision, their personality, and the moment they're trying to create. I work very closely with stylists and clients, ensuring every detail aligns with their desires. But what I always bring to the table is a level of passion and artistry that goes beyond just the practical aspects. I want my shoes to tell a story, to have a soul. For Mariah's Christmas tour, I set the mood by playing her holiday music on repeat, drawing inspiration from her and what her stylists and I discussed. I then translate that feeling into a timeless, luxurious, and powerful design. Every choice I make—materials, colors, crystals—is a deliberate step towards creating something that will not only elevate the person wearing them but also enhance the moment and leave a lasting impression.
The hallmark of a Flor de Maria Rivera design is the perfect balance of luxury, comfort, and show-stopping style. Every shoe is meticulously crafted with attention to detail, from the stitching to the placement of crystals. Comfort is a top priority—that's why we create our shoe lasts, which I like to think of as the heart of the shoe, ensuring every pair looks incredible and feels amazing. We use only the finest materials to create shoes that empower women to look and feel their best, whether they're on the red carpet or living their everyday lives. My designs are always made to make a lasting impact.
When designing for artists like Nicki Minaj and Eva Longoria, I start by truly understanding their unique personalities and styles. For Nicki, it's all about bold, daring designs that push boundaries and make a statement. With Eva, it's more about classic elegance with a modern twist—something that complements her grace and timeless beauty. My goal is to create a piece that reflects their essence and feels personal to them.
This approach to customization is reflected in my collections, where I offer a range of shoes for every occasion and every type of woman. The options are endless, from flats, kitten heels, sandals, and mules to pumps, ballerinas, tall boots, short boots, and slingbacks. Every woman deserves a shoe that fits her style, and that's why I ensure my designs are versatile yet luxurious so there's something special for everyone.
As a Latina designer, one of the biggest challenges has been navigating an industry that hasn't always been inclusive. The luxury fashion world is often dominated by established names, and as a self-funded brand without the capital that huge companies have, it's been a journey of resilience. It takes a lot of grit, persistence, and the willingness to fight for your place at the table. But if you look at any top red carpet, you'll find Flor de Maria alongside the biggest names in luxury, like Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin, and others. A-list celebrities wear the brand, and you'll see my designs in top fashion magazines worldwide. That's not just a reflection of hard work—it's a testament to the power of showing up, staying true to my vision, and letting my work speak for itself.
What we've built at Flor de Maria speaks for itself. Our work stands alongside these iconic brands because we've shown up with passion, creativity, and uncompromising quality. We've earned our place at the top, which truly matters. My goal is to prove that talent, authenticity, and hard work can break any barriers and inspire future generations of diverse designers to do the same.
Honestly, the most rewarding part of my journey is waking up every day and doing what I love. But there have been some moments that just hit me in a way I can't even put into words. Like seeing Shakira—someone I've admired and listened to for so long—wearing my shoes. I still get emotional thinking about it. To see her wearing something I created—it's surreal.
Then, I saw my shoes on American Idol and stars like Kylie Jenner, Demi Lovato, Nicki Minaj, and Camila Cabello. I literally pinch myself. But what really blows me away is having my designs featured on And Just Like That—the Sex and the City sequel. That show is iconic. I've probably watched every episode 10,000 times. It's all about fashion and shoes. To see my designs on a show like that, it's something I'll never forget.
But at the end of the day, it's moments like these—the ones where I can feel how far I've come—that make all the hard work, sleepless nights, and sacrifices worth it. I'm so blessed to wake up every day, create something I truly love, and know that it resonates with others. That's the gift.
One of my biggest dreams is to work with global icons like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé—two women who empower others through their artistry and influence. Taylor is all about women's power, lifting up other women through her music and actions, and to see my designs on her would be such an honor. Beyoncé, of course, has always been a powerful inspiration—her strength, confidence, and empowerment message align perfectly with Flor de Maria's spirit. Having both of them wear my shoes would be a dream come true.
I also dream of opening brick-and-mortar stores and seeing Flor de Maria take over the world. I dream of seeing my shoes in iconic international department stores like Selfridges, Rinascente Milano (where I shopped when I moved to Milan to study shoe design), and Harrods, to name a few. We're already seeing our shoes on international red carpets like the Venice Film Festival, AMFAR, and Paris Fashion Week, and featured in top magazines across Paris, Italy, Greece, Russia, etc. Still, the ultimate goal is to see our designs in these legendary retail spaces—and to have Flor de Maria become a global name.
We don't mass-produce our shoes. Each piece is carefully crafted in limited quantities, which helps reduce waste and ensures we're not contributing to overproduction or unsold stock ending up in landfills. Instead of releasing new shoes every week, like many other brands, we curate each collection thoughtfully, ensuring it has lasting value—both in design and quality.
We use ethically sourced materials, and we're committed to sustainability. We are constantly learning and evolving, striving to find the perfect balance between luxury, quality, and responsibility. Our goal is to create designs that stand the test of time and are gentle on the planet.
My advice to aspiring designers is simple: never stop chasing your dreams. The road to success is never easy, but it's always worth it. There will be setbacks, but don't let them define you. Stay true to your vision, your values, and your integrity. Trust in your craft, and never compromise who you are. As a Latina, embrace the power of your culture—it's a unique strength that will set you apart. Believe in yourself, work relentlessly, and never let anyone tell you you can't achieve your dreams. The world needs your voice, perspective, and talent more than ever.
This year's bold statement shoes will be everywhere for holiday footwear—think crystal embellishments, feathers, and dramatic heels. It's all about sparkle, glamour, and making an impact, with comfort still being key for those who want to look fabulous without compromising wearability.
And now, the big surprise! We have a NEW shoe coming. Her name is BLAKE, and she's the shoe to have this holiday season!  BLAKE is a showstopper—bold, glamorous, and unapologetically fierce. We've been keeping her under wraps, but she'll be available for our holiday drop in December, just in time for the Holiday season. I already see her on the red carpet, and who knows, maybe on And Just Like That (the Sex and the City sequel)
For Black Friday, I recommend our EMILY knee-high boots, crafted from high-quality materials and with two calf sizes, for an inclusive fit. Timeless and classic, these boots are perfect for any occasion. 
Next, the JAIMIE slingback pumps in chocolate patent leather combine sleek sophistication with comfort. Featuring a pointed toe and secure fit, they will be in your closet year after year, and you will wear them nonstop. 
Finally, the SYLVIE stiletto sandals in black patent leather are a showstopper with chic buckle details and a bold gold heel. They are ideal for any party or night out and will elevate your wardrobe and keep you stylish all season!
