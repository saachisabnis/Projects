Beyoncé was compared to a dog urinating on a tree because she had the audacity to intrude into the country music space with her newest album, according to actor John Schneider.
Schneider, who is best known for the Southern-based TV show “Dukes of Hazzard” back in the 1970s, had his moribund career resuscitated on Tyler Perry’s hit series “The Haves and Have Nots.” Yet, the actor and country music singer was offended that Queen Bey would dare cross over.
Bey dropped two new singles, “16 Carriages” and “Hold ‘Em” during Super Bowl 2024 while announcing the country-flavored album Act II.
Schneider voiced his displeasure on the right-wing show “One American News” by calling Beyoncé a musical interloper who needs to mark her new territory everywhere she goes.
“The lefties in the entertainment industry just won’t leave any area alone, right? They just have to seize control over every aspect, don’t they?” the host asked Schneider. 
Schneider, 63, continued by saying that “They’ve got to make their mark, just like a dog in a dog walk park. You know, every dog has to mark every tree, right? So that’s what’s going on here.”
At the same time, Schneider seemed to rationalize and forgive the country music stars who crossover into pop music like Shania Twain, but does not have that same energy for Bey, who crossed over in reverse.
A user wrote on X. “Former Dukes of Hazzards has been likens Beyonce to a urinating dog because she decides to make a Country Western album. He needs to research Country Western.”
Another person added that “Comparing Beyonce to a dog is hateful. As a country fan, I welcome her and let’s see what she has.”
Others pointed out that Beyonce, unlike Schneider, hails from Texas – the home of country music.
“And John Schneider isn’t even from Texas, but Beyonce is,” posted one. “He’s lame just like his songs and his acting.”
