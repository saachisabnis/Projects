For years, 50 Cent has thrown subtle jabs at Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Brunch. 
He continues to jab the former annual gathering in the latest episode of the Flagant podcast with Andrew Schulz. During his recent appearance, 50 addressed the swirling allegations against Jay-Z—claims Jay’s legal team has firmly denied, pointing out inconsistencies in the lawsuit. 
The case, which also names Diddy, has become the latest fuel for public intrigue. Despite the legal drama, 50 took a moment to reflect on his personal dynamic with Jay, describing their relationship as largely “competitive stuff” but not without a few contentious moments.
One such moment, he claims, unfolded around the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show. “He didn’t want me there,” 50 said, referring to Jay’s role in producing the performance through Roc Nation. Ultimately, 50 took the stage alongside Eminem, often credited as the reason for his inclusion. “It’s just competitive stuff,” 50 repeated. “But when it goes beyond music—when you start blocking things in business—that’s when it gets weird. Then it feels like real beef.”
He didn’t stop there. In his trademark blend of humor and bluntness, 50 poked fun at Jay’s celebrated marriage to Beyoncé, calling it “the most important contract he’s ever signed.” He went on to tease Jay’s appearances at Roc Nation brunches, mimicking an imagined speech: “I’m not aware of anything going on here. This is the one time I’m gonna be with you n****s this year. I feel normal again. Get me out of here.”
As expected, the episode quickly went viral, with 50 acknowledging the buzz on Instagram: “Of course we are going to go viral.”
Beyond his latest antics, 50 Cent is gearing up for a new chapter. He’s set to launch a brief Las Vegas residency, The In Da Club Experience, starting December 27 at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. Recently, he also made a cameo in the Dave Meyers-directed short film accompanying Missionary, the collaborative album from Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.
Whether mocking his peers or commanding stages, 50 Cent continues to balance controversy, comedy, and career longevity—proving, once again, that he remains a master of keeping audiences talking.
