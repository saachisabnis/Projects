Christina Milian is voicing her support for Blue Ivy, Beyoncé’s daughter, after she faced criticism over her appearance at the Los Angeles premiere for Mufasa: Lion King.
Blue Ivy, who voices Kiara in the film, faced backlash over the outfit she wore to Tuesday's (December 10) red carpet premiere. The 12-year-old appeared on the carpet in a strapless, gold ball gown alongside her parents, Bey and Jay-Z, and her grandma, Tina Knowles.
During her appearance on the Sherri Shepherd Show, Milian addressed social media critics who deemed Blue's dress as "inappropriate."
“First of all, she looks gorgeous. I think the fact that anybody has anything to say about someone else’s daughter, any minor, I think just mind your business," Milian said.
“She’s talented, she toured the world with her mom, like there’s nothing you can say. You can’t dim that shine…Let that baby glow," she added.
The Carters appeared at the Mufasa: Lion King premiere just one day after Jay-Z was named in a lawsuit alleging that he raped a 13-year-old girl alongside Diddy at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty in 2000. Jay-Z quickly released a statement denying the allegations against him. 
Amid all the social media buzz, Beyoncé celebrated her daughter's film accomplishment in a social media post. 
“My gorgeous baby girl,” Bey wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of Blue. “This is your night. You worked hard and you did such a beautiful job as the voice of Kiara. Your family could not be prouder. Keep shining.”
