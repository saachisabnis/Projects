Kylie Jenner looked effortlessly chic while going for a stroll in Italy with her daughter, Stormi, and her son, Aire.
The “Kardashians” star was photographed wearing a light-wash denim midi dress by Marni ($1,250) with spaghetti straps and a square neckline as she enjoyed time with her kids and BFF Stassi Karanikolaou.
Jenner accessorized her look with black narrow sunglasses as well as a pair of black and clear flip flops ($650) and a hand-woven raffia tote bag ($1,090), both from The Row.
The Kylie Cosmetics founder seemed to be in good spirits and was seen smiling while holding hands with Aire. 
Stormi, 6, matched her mom’s look in a white tank top and an adorable denim skirt. She wore one black strappy sandal but had a black boot running up most of one of her legs. 
Meanwhile, Aire, 2, sported a short-sleeve white T-shirt, dark yellow pants and matching white and yellow sneakers. 
Jenner, 26, brought along her longtime best friend and the two were seen both holding onto Aire’s hand while playfully lifting him into the air on the walk.
Karanikolaou, 27, wore light-wash denim shorts and a long-sleeve, low-cut floral top with black ballet flats and aviator sunglasses. 
The duo took the stroll after jamming out while in attendance at Coldplay’s concert in the Stadio Olimpico stadium in Rome.
“best night of my life 🥺❤️ @coldplay ilysm,” Karanikolaou captioned a video of her and Jenner crying to their hit song “Fix You.”
Jenner has been keeping a fairly low profile over the last few weeks but was most recently spotted out with her boyfriend, Timothée Chalamet.
The Khy founder and the “Dune” actor, 28, were seen wearing casual outfits while heading to a movie date in the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Calif., last month.
The relaxed outing marked the first time the two had been photographed together since they showed off their love for one another at the Golden Globe Awards in January. 
Jenner and Chalamet have kept their relationship fairly private ever since they sparked romance rumors in April 2023.
However, they seemed to confirm they were an item when they were seen making out at a Beyoncé concert in September. 
Prior to Chalamet, Jenner was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Travis Scott –– whom she shares Stormi and Aire with –– from 2017 to 2022.
