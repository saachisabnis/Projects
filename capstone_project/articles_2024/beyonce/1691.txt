Chrissy Teigen is walking on the wild side.
The cookbook author turned heads in a sheer leopard-printed dress as she joined husband John Legend at the City Harvest 2024 gala in NYC Wednesday night — and she left little to the imagination in her bare gown.
Teigen, 38, went braless under her sheer animal-print Nina Ricci dress ($1,615), which tied at the shoulders with long black velvet ribbons.
She wore her hair in an updo with loose tendrils framing her face, adding chunky gold bangle bracelets and 1980s-inspired Saint Laurent earrings ($1,090) featuring black velvet and goldtone rosettes.
Teigen carried a black clutch for the night, showing off a deep brown manicure and smokey eye makeup as she walked the red carpet at Cipriani 42nd Street.
Legend — who was honored at the Motown-themed fundraiser gala — matched with his wife in a black suit featuring sparkly brown floral appliques.

At the event, Legend told Page Six that life with four kids was “so good,” but when Teigen brought up baby number five, the “All of Me” singer shut it down with a quick “no!” 
The celeb-filled fundraiser raised money to prevent food insecurity in NYC, with other stars like Taye Diggs, Richard Gere, Busy Philipps and “The Real Housewives of New York City” star Ubah Hassan in attendance.
As for Teigen’s sheer dress, this is the second time in recent days she’s gone for the less-is-more look. 
The mom of four rocked a see-through corseted dress to Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s annual Oscars party last month while admitting in an Instagram post that the look revealed her “boob lift scars.”
