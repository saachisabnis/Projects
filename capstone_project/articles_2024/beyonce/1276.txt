Latto was the latest to present flowers to Lil Kim, who is recognized as one of the greatest female rappers ever. 
The Queen of Da Souf recently declared Queen B as the GOAT,  an acronym for “greatest female of all time,” during an episode of Complex’s “GOAT Talk.” The “Put It On Da Floor” hitmaker, accompanied by her sister Brooklyn, shared her admiration for the Brooklyn native while discussing various topics. 
“The GOAT is Lil’ Kim, for sure,” Latto said. “She’s a fashion icon with timeless music and unforgettable looks. She’s a permanent fixture in not just rap, but in female rap specifically.”
While her sister agreed with Latto, she also named the rap star the greatest. Latto agreed after a brief rundown of her achievements. Latto continued by describing Lil’ Kim as “a queen, for real” and expressing her genuine affection for the rapper. 
She referenced Lil’ Kim’s classic track “Big Momma Thang” as a nod to the veteran artist’s lasting influence. Latto even addressed a potential connection between her own “Big Mama” persona and Lil’ Kim’s, clarifying that the similarities were unintentional. “I hope she doesn’t take it as me trying to steal her style,” said Latto.
Queen B was a key inspiration for Latto’s new Sugar Honey Iced Tea album. “I feel like what I’m doing hasn’t been done before,” she explained. “Visually, I’ve drawn from Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, and Lil’ Kim. Musically, I’ve been influenced by Kelis, but with my own Southern Hip Hop twist.”
The new album features collaborations with artists like Young Nudy, Coco Jones, Megan Thee Stallion, and Ciara. Among the two volumes are hits such as “Put It On Da Floor Again” with Cardi B and “Sunday Service.”
Lil Kim has not commented on the mention at this time.
