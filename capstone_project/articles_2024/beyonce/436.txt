Although it sounds like the plot of a horror movie, “Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived” is a rhyme used to teach British schoolchildren about the unfortunate wives of Henry VIII.




 
In “SIX: The Musical,” written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, the six wives of Henry VIII take the stage to tell their own stories and reclaim their identities, which have been eclipsed throughout history by their infamous husband.
Performed in the manner of a singing contest with each wife embodying the attributes and styles of iconic pop singers, “SIX: The Musical” won a Tony Award for Best Original Score in 2022.
In December, Melody Lane Performing Arts Center in Cape Coral brings the wildly popular musical sensation “SIX The Musical: Teen Edition” to Ter-Tinis event center in Fort Myers.
“We have been open since 2017, and this is a performing arts center, so there’s a lot of dance classes, but we have produced over 25 musicals, and it’s with students from all over Southwest Florida,” said Melody Lane Music and Theater Director Dana Alvarez. “We also take groups to the Junior Theater Festival in Atlanta, and we also went to California and Texas one year where we got to perform and be adjudicated with people from all over the globe. It’s mainly three of us — Dana Alvarez, Amber Angeloro and Sami Doherty — she’s a co-owner of Melody Lane. She’s the choreographer.”

According to Alvarez, Ter-Tinis event center is the perfect venue for “SIX The Musical: Teen Edition.”
“It’s a very intimate setting. It’s a music concert venue. It seats 100 to 120, which having that kind of an intimate environment is really great for a show of this size to make everybody feel like they’re a part of it. There’s also a green room above the stage and a spiral staircase that comes down so the girls can have cool entrances and things. And they serve food and drinks there. For people who don’t consider themselves typical musical-theater lovers, they can put that right out of their heads because there’s something for everyone here. This is a concert with modern music. Whether you like pop music, rock, hip hop, R&B, that’s all in there — even techno.
The young ladies in “SIX the Musical-Teen Edition” will be performing Dec. 5 to 8 at Ter-Tinis in Fort Myers.
“Truth be told, quite a few schools have done ‘SIX’ recently since the rights came out, but at Melody Lane, we have students from all over Southwest Florida, so you get to see a variety of ages and geography covered, but seeing kids from other schools work together and not feel a rivalry and to feel like a family, I think that’s very special about doing shows here,” she added.
Eleven girls between the ages of 15 to 18 perform in the modern re-telling of history, or in this case — “her-story.”
High-school senior Hannah Cruz portrays Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon, who is imagined as a modern-day cross between Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson.
Anne Boleyn is played by Fort Myers High School junior Emma Kane and Addison Smith. Boleyn’s character is influenced by singers Avril Lavigne and Lily Allen.
Katy Reich portrays Jane Seymour with the smooth, sultry influences of Adele, Sia and Celine Dion.
Alexa Careccia, freshman at Bishop Verot High School, is Anna of Cleves. Her character is a spicy mix of Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.
North Fort Myers High School student Georgia Rainero plays Catherine Howard, a sassy, witty combination of Britney Spears and Ariana Grande.
Catherine Parr, portrayed by Lia Jaquez, embodies the passionate personas of Alicia Keys and Emeli Sandé.
Ensemble members are Eleanor Bonds, Luciana Mendez, Karrington Kennelly and Tatiana Robinson, who play the ladies in waiting to the Tudor queens.
In a show stacked with dueling queens, it’s the camaraderie and silliness that bring the cast the most enjoyment.
“’House of Holbein’ is a number to look forward to. If it’s not an audience favorite, it is my favorite. We all do funny German accents. The lyrics are hilarious,” Reich said. “It’s a comedic number, and the dance is pop, but we have a section of dance where the point is to look as silly as possible. So, we’re literally getting down. It’s the most fun, seriously. There’s so much audience interaction. There’s never a moment where you feel disconnected. There’s even parts where we go into audience.”
Pairing clever lyrics with playful dance moves, the show turns historical anecdotes into high-energy humor.
“If I were to describe this show in two words, they would be dynamic or empowering. What I like about this show is that all the songs are so fun, and they’re really fun to dance to. I love learning the choreography of all of them,” said Bonds.
The combination of dance and comedy in the production creates opportunities for fresh and unexpected moments on the stage.
“A lot of characters have really funny moments, and I like that every night could be a little bit different. You could do a different pose or a different reaction to whatever someone else says, and that’s what’s so much fun about this show. It’s like a concert. People are never going to know what happens next, really,” said Rainero.
A notable challenge for the cast is maintaining stamina for the duration of the concert-style show.
“For most musicals, not every character is in every scene, but this isn’t really your normal musical that you watch. It’s more or less a concert, which means that the six of us and our ladies, we never leave the stage,” explained Jaquez.
“Guys, go to the bathroom,” teased Kane (with a hint of seriousness). “Usually, when you think of a concert, it’s just two hours of straight music. We do have mini little scenes, but it’s just like Roast Battle 101. It’s so funny. It’s like a real show.”
Each cast member juggles rehearsals in addition to the demands of schoolwork, busy schedules and high heels.
“This is so silly, but I never wear heels. I mean, so I wear these heel boots, and, actually, they’re so hard to bust down in,” Kane said. “And we have a month until this show, and we have to learn every single day. I know we all do so much other stuff. I don’t think there’s a single person in this room that’s not in something else right now. We all have so much going on and this at the same time. It’s just a lot, but I think we all can say we love it so much.”
The production centers around the idea of empowerment. Through bold choreography and contemporary pop music, the wives of Henry VIII challenge their respective narratives and emerge as fiercely powerful individuals.
Director Amber Angeloro explained, “It really is just a story of empowerment. A downtrodden class that has been discriminated against and mistreated for centuries rising up. And they feel confi dent in themselves, and they’re able to unite and band together as a sisterhood to support one another and be unified in that way. And that’s just a really beautiful thing, and it’s valuable. We hope as directors that that message is not lost on any of the girls who are involved, and hopefully, the audience receives that message, as well, and can take that home with them.”
The relevance of personal empowerment and identity resonates deeply with the cast members.
“I think, at least for women, it’s very hard to feel empowered and to feel beautiful and feel like you have a place in this world. I think anyone who just needs to be seen or heard, especially young girls should know that you have a voice, know that you deserve to be heard by other people because it matters,” said Cruz.
Careccia believes the show sends audiences an important message about self-confidence and the nature of beauty.
“A lot of people now in our generation, using Snapchat, the first thing people will say is, ‘What do you look like?’” Careccia said. “And so we’re based off of our looks without even meeting a person, and I think that through ‘SIX,’ we’re able to tell people that you’re more than just a first impression, and you can be judged off of your heart because it shouldn’t matter what one person who’s never actually met you before’s opinion on your looks is because you’re beautiful inside.”
History is hers to tell in this inspiring production, and audiences won’t want to miss the show. ¦

“We have been open since 2017, and this is a performing arts center, so there’s a lot of dance classes, but we have produced over 25 musicals, and it’s with students from all over Southwest Florida,” said Melody Lane Music and Theater Director Dana Alvarez. “We also take groups to the Junior Theater Festival in Atlanta, and we also went to California and Texas one year where we got to perform and be adjudicated with people from all over the globe. It’s mainly three of us — Dana Alvarez, Amber Angeloro and Sami Doherty — she’s a co-owner of Melody Lane. She’s the choreographer.”

According to Alvarez, Ter-Tinis event center is the perfect venue for “SIX The Musical: Teen Edition.”
“It’s a very intimate setting. It’s a music concert venue. It seats 100 to 120, which having that kind of an intimate environment is really great for a show of this size to make everybody feel like they’re a part of it. There’s also a green room above the stage and a spiral staircase that comes down so the girls can have cool entrances and things. And they serve food and drinks there. For people who don’t consider themselves typical musical-theater lovers, they can put that right out of their heads because there’s something for everyone here. This is a concert with modern music. Whether you like pop music, rock, hip hop, R&B, that’s all in there — even techno.
The young ladies in “SIX the Musical-Teen Edition” will be performing Dec. 5 to 8 at Ter-Tinis in Fort Myers.
“Truth be told, quite a few schools have done ‘SIX’ recently since the rights came out, but at Melody Lane, we have students from all over Southwest Florida, so you get to see a variety of ages and geography covered, but seeing kids from other schools work together and not feel a rivalry and to feel like a family, I think that’s very special about doing shows here,” she added.
Eleven girls between the ages of 15 to 18 perform in the modern re-telling of history, or in this case — “her-story.”
High-school senior Hannah Cruz portrays Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon, who is imagined as a modern-day cross between Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson.
Anne Boleyn is played by Fort Myers High School junior Emma Kane and Addison Smith. Boleyn’s character is influenced by singers Avril Lavigne and Lily Allen.
Katy Reich portrays Jane Seymour with the smooth, sultry influences of Adele, Sia and Celine Dion.
Alexa Careccia, freshman at Bishop Verot High School, is Anna of Cleves. Her character is a spicy mix of Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.
North Fort Myers High School student Georgia Rainero plays Catherine Howard, a sassy, witty combination of Britney Spears and Ariana Grande.
Catherine Parr, portrayed by Lia Jaquez, embodies the passionate personas of Alicia Keys and Emeli Sandé.
Ensemble members are Eleanor Bonds, Luciana Mendez, Karrington Kennelly and Tatiana Robinson, who play the ladies in waiting to the Tudor queens.
In a show stacked with dueling queens, it’s the camaraderie and silliness that bring the cast the most enjoyment.
“’House of Holbein’ is a number to look forward to. If it’s not an audience favorite, it is my favorite. We all do funny German accents. The lyrics are hilarious,” Reich said. “It’s a comedic number, and the dance is pop, but we have a section of dance where the point is to look as silly as possible. So, we’re literally getting down. It’s the most fun, seriously. There’s so much audience interaction. There’s never a moment where you feel disconnected. There’s even parts where we go into audience.”
Pairing clever lyrics with playful dance moves, the show turns historical anecdotes into high-energy humor.
“If I were to describe this show in two words, they would be dynamic or empowering. What I like about this show is that all the songs are so fun, and they’re really fun to dance to. I love learning the choreography of all of them,” said Bonds.
The combination of dance and comedy in the production creates opportunities for fresh and unexpected moments on the stage.
“A lot of characters have really funny moments, and I like that every night could be a little bit different. You could do a different pose or a different reaction to whatever someone else says, and that’s what’s so much fun about this show. It’s like a concert. People are never going to know what happens next, really,” said Rainero.
A notable challenge for the cast is maintaining stamina for the duration of the concert-style show.
“For most musicals, not every character is in every scene, but this isn’t really your normal musical that you watch. It’s more or less a concert, which means that the six of us and our ladies, we never leave the stage,” explained Jaquez.
“Guys, go to the bathroom,” teased Kane (with a hint of seriousness). “Usually, when you think of a concert, it’s just two hours of straight music. We do have mini little scenes, but it’s just like Roast Battle 101. It’s so funny. It’s like a real show.”
Each cast member juggles rehearsals in addition to the demands of schoolwork, busy schedules and high heels.
“This is so silly, but I never wear heels. I mean, so I wear these heel boots, and, actually, they’re so hard to bust down in,” Kane said. “And we have a month until this show, and we have to learn every single day. I know we all do so much other stuff. I don’t think there’s a single person in this room that’s not in something else right now. We all have so much going on and this at the same time. It’s just a lot, but I think we all can say we love it so much.”
The production centers around the idea of empowerment. Through bold choreography and contemporary pop music, the wives of Henry VIII challenge their respective narratives and emerge as fiercely powerful individuals.
Director Amber Angeloro explained, “It really is just a story of empowerment. A downtrodden class that has been discriminated against and mistreated for centuries rising up. And they feel confi dent in themselves, and they’re able to unite and band together as a sisterhood to support one another and be unified in that way. And that’s just a really beautiful thing, and it’s valuable. We hope as directors that that message is not lost on any of the girls who are involved, and hopefully, the audience receives that message, as well, and can take that home with them.”
The relevance of personal empowerment and identity resonates deeply with the cast members.
“I think, at least for women, it’s very hard to feel empowered and to feel beautiful and feel like you have a place in this world. I think anyone who just needs to be seen or heard, especially young girls should know that you have a voice, know that you deserve to be heard by other people because it matters,” said Cruz.
Careccia believes the show sends audiences an important message about self-confidence and the nature of beauty.
“A lot of people now in our generation, using Snapchat, the first thing people will say is, ‘What do you look like?’” Careccia said. “And so we’re based off of our looks without even meeting a person, and I think that through ‘SIX,’ we’re able to tell people that you’re more than just a first impression, and you can be judged off of your heart because it shouldn’t matter what one person who’s never actually met you before’s opinion on your looks is because you’re beautiful inside.”
History is hers to tell in this inspiring production, and audiences won’t want to miss the show. ¦

“A lot of people now in our generation, using Snapchat, the first thing people will say is, ‘What do you look like?’” Careccia said. “And so we’re based off of our looks without even meeting a person, and I think that through ‘SIX,’ we’re able to tell people that you’re more than just a first impression, and you can be judged off of your heart because it shouldn’t matter what one person who’s never actually met you before’s opinion on your looks is because you’re beautiful inside.”
History is hers to tell in this inspiring production, and audiences won’t want to miss the show. ¦

High-school senior Hannah Cruz portrays Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon, who is imagined as a modern-day cross between Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson.
Anne Boleyn is played by Fort Myers High School junior Emma Kane and Addison Smith. Boleyn’s character is influenced by singers Avril Lavigne and Lily Allen.
Katy Reich portrays Jane Seymour with the smooth, sultry influences of Adele, Sia and Celine Dion.
Alexa Careccia, freshman at Bishop Verot High School, is Anna of Cleves. Her character is a spicy mix of Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.
North Fort Myers High School student Georgia Rainero plays Catherine Howard, a sassy, witty combination of Britney Spears and Ariana Grande.
Catherine Parr, portrayed by Lia Jaquez, embodies the passionate personas of Alicia Keys and Emeli Sandé.
Ensemble members are Eleanor Bonds, Luciana Mendez, Karrington Kennelly and Tatiana Robinson, who play the ladies in waiting to the Tudor queens.
In a show stacked with dueling queens, it’s the camaraderie and silliness that bring the cast the most enjoyment.
“’House of Holbein’ is a number to look forward to. If it’s not an audience favorite, it is my favorite. We all do funny German accents. The lyrics are hilarious,” Reich said. “It’s a comedic number, and the dance is pop, but we have a section of dance where the point is to look as silly as possible. So, we’re literally getting down. It’s the most fun, seriously. There’s so much audience interaction. There’s never a moment where you feel disconnected. There’s even parts where we go into audience.”
Pairing clever lyrics with playful dance moves, the show turns historical anecdotes into high-energy humor.
“If I were to describe this show in two words, they would be dynamic or empowering. What I like about this show is that all the songs are so fun, and they’re really fun to dance to. I love learning the choreography of all of them,” said Bonds.
The combination of dance and comedy in the production creates opportunities for fresh and unexpected moments on the stage.
“A lot of characters have really funny moments, and I like that every night could be a little bit different. You could do a different pose or a different reaction to whatever someone else says, and that’s what’s so much fun about this show. It’s like a concert. People are never going to know what happens next, really,” said Rainero.
A notable challenge for the cast is maintaining stamina for the duration of the concert-style show.
“For most musicals, not every character is in every scene, but this isn’t really your normal musical that you watch. It’s more or less a concert, which means that the six of us and our ladies, we never leave the stage,” explained Jaquez.
“Guys, go to the bathroom,” teased Kane (with a hint of seriousness). “Usually, when you think of a concert, it’s just two hours of straight music. We do have mini little scenes, but it’s just like Roast Battle 101. It’s so funny. It’s like a real show.”
Each cast member juggles rehearsals in addition to the demands of schoolwork, busy schedules and high heels.
“This is so silly, but I never wear heels. I mean, so I wear these heel boots, and, actually, they’re so hard to bust down in,” Kane said. “And we have a month until this show, and we have to learn every single day. I know we all do so much other stuff. I don’t think there’s a single person in this room that’s not in something else right now. We all have so much going on and this at the same time. It’s just a lot, but I think we all can say we love it so much.”
The production centers around the idea of empowerment. Through bold choreography and contemporary pop music, the wives of Henry VIII challenge their respective narratives and emerge as fiercely powerful individuals.
Director Amber Angeloro explained, “It really is just a story of empowerment. A downtrodden class that has been discriminated against and mistreated for centuries rising up. And they feel confi dent in themselves, and they’re able to unite and band together as a sisterhood to support one another and be unified in that way. And that’s just a really beautiful thing, and it’s valuable. We hope as directors that that message is not lost on any of the girls who are involved, and hopefully, the audience receives that message, as well, and can take that home with them.”
The relevance of personal empowerment and identity resonates deeply with the cast members.
“I think, at least for women, it’s very hard to feel empowered and to feel beautiful and feel like you have a place in this world. I think anyone who just needs to be seen or heard, especially young girls should know that you have a voice, know that you deserve to be heard by other people because it matters,” said Cruz.

In a show stacked with dueling queens, it’s the camaraderie and silliness that bring the cast the most enjoyment.
“’House of Holbein’ is a number to look forward to. If it’s not an audience favorite, it is my favorite. We all do funny German accents. The lyrics are hilarious,” Reich said. “It’s a comedic number, and the dance is pop, but we have a section of dance where the point is to look as silly as possible. So, we’re literally getting down. It’s the most fun, seriously. There’s so much audience interaction. There’s never a moment where you feel disconnected. There’s even parts where we go into audience.”
Pairing clever lyrics with playful dance moves, the show turns historical anecdotes into high-energy humor.
“If I were to describe this show in two words, they would be dynamic or empowering. What I like about this show is that all the songs are so fun, and they’re really fun to dance to. I love learning the choreography of all of them,” said Bonds.
The combination of dance and comedy in the production creates opportunities for fresh and unexpected moments on the stage.
“A lot of characters have really funny moments, and I like that every night could be a little bit different. You could do a different pose or a different reaction to whatever someone else says, and that’s what’s so much fun about this show. It’s like a concert. People are never going to know what happens next, really,” said Rainero.
A notable challenge for the cast is maintaining stamina for the duration of the concert-style show.
“For most musicals, not every character is in every scene, but this isn’t really your normal musical that you watch. It’s more or less a concert, which means that the six of us and our ladies, we never leave the stage,” explained Jaquez.
“Guys, go to the bathroom,” teased Kane (with a hint of seriousness). “Usually, when you think of a concert, it’s just two hours of straight music. We do have mini little scenes, but it’s just like Roast Battle 101. It’s so funny. It’s like a real show.”
Each cast member juggles rehearsals in addition to the demands of schoolwork, busy schedules and high heels.
“This is so silly, but I never wear heels. I mean, so I wear these heel boots, and, actually, they’re so hard to bust down in,” Kane said. “And we have a month until this show, and we have to learn every single day. I know we all do so much other stuff. I don’t think there’s a single person in this room that’s not in something else right now. We all have so much going on and this at the same time. It’s just a lot, but I think we all can say we love it so much.”
The production centers around the idea of empowerment. Through bold choreography and contemporary pop music, the wives of Henry VIII challenge their respective narratives and emerge as fiercely powerful individuals.
Director Amber Angeloro explained, “It really is just a story of empowerment. A downtrodden class that has been discriminated against and mistreated for centuries rising up. And they feel confi dent in themselves, and they’re able to unite and band together as a sisterhood to support one another and be unified in that way. And that’s just a really beautiful thing, and it’s valuable. We hope as directors that that message is not lost on any of the girls who are involved, and hopefully, the audience receives that message, as well, and can take that home with them.”
The relevance of personal empowerment and identity resonates deeply with the cast members.
“I think, at least for women, it’s very hard to feel empowered and to feel beautiful and feel like you have a place in this world. I think anyone who just needs to be seen or heard, especially young girls should know that you have a voice, know that you deserve to be heard by other people because it matters,” said Cruz.
Careccia believes the show sends audiences an important message about self-confidence and the nature of beauty.
“A lot of people now in our generation, using Snapchat, the first thing people will say is, ‘What do you look like?’” Careccia said. “And so we’re based off of our looks without even meeting a person, and I think that through ‘SIX,’ we’re able to tell people that you’re more than just a first impression, and you can be judged off of your heart because it shouldn’t matter what one person who’s never actually met you before’s opinion on your looks is because you’re beautiful inside.”
History is hers to tell in this inspiring production, and audiences won’t want to miss the show. ¦

“For most musicals, not every character is in every scene, but this isn’t really your normal musical that you watch. It’s more or less a concert, which means that the six of us and our ladies, we never leave the stage,” explained Jaquez.
“Guys, go to the bathroom,” teased Kane (with a hint of seriousness). “Usually, when you think of a concert, it’s just two hours of straight music. We do have mini little scenes, but it’s just like Roast Battle 101. It’s so funny. It’s like a real show.”
Each cast member juggles rehearsals in addition to the demands of schoolwork, busy schedules and high heels.
“This is so silly, but I never wear heels. I mean, so I wear these heel boots, and, actually, they’re so hard to bust down in,” Kane said. “And we have a month until this show, and we have to learn every single day. I know we all do so much other stuff. I don’t think there’s a single person in this room that’s not in something else right now. We all have so much going on and this at the same time. It’s just a lot, but I think we all can say we love it so much.”
The production centers around the idea of empowerment. Through bold choreography and contemporary pop music, the wives of Henry VIII challenge their respective narratives and emerge as fiercely powerful individuals.
Director Amber Angeloro explained, “It really is just a story of empowerment. A downtrodden class that has been discriminated against and mistreated for centuries rising up. And they feel confi dent in themselves, and they’re able to unite and band together as a sisterhood to support one another and be unified in that way. And that’s just a really beautiful thing, and it’s valuable. We hope as directors that that message is not lost on any of the girls who are involved, and hopefully, the audience receives that message, as well, and can take that home with them.”
The relevance of personal empowerment and identity resonates deeply with the cast members.
“I think, at least for women, it’s very hard to feel empowered and to feel beautiful and feel like you have a place in this world. I think anyone who just needs to be seen or heard, especially young girls should know that you have a voice, know that you deserve to be heard by other people because it matters,” said Cruz.
Careccia believes the show sends audiences an important message about self-confidence and the nature of beauty.
“A lot of people now in our generation, using Snapchat, the first thing people will say is, ‘What do you look like?’” Careccia said. “And so we’re based off of our looks without even meeting a person, and I think that through ‘SIX,’ we’re able to tell people that you’re more than just a first impression, and you can be judged off of your heart because it shouldn’t matter what one person who’s never actually met you before’s opinion on your looks is because you’re beautiful inside.”
History is hers to tell in this inspiring production, and audiences won’t want to miss the show. ¦
