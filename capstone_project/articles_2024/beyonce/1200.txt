Future and Metro Boomin are gearing up for their second album in a month’s time,  We Still Don’t Trust You , and they just unveiled the cover art.
Ahead of its release on Friday (April 12), the pair dropped the album artwork on Instagram. The black and white cover is broken into four squares, with two showing the guys in suits while they’re each masked up in the other two.

While posting a teaser trailer last week, Metro confirmed that this is not a deluxe version of last month’s chart-topping album We Don’t Trust You, but instead a whole new project.
Check out the cover below.
According to Billboard, the first project debuted with 251,000 equivalent album units on April 1 – making for the highest sales week of the year at the time and Future’s second biggest ever behind What a Time To Be Alive, his 2015 collaboration with Drake.
We Don’t Trust You also marks Future’s ninth number one album and Metro Boomin’s fourth.

Most of the sales of the album were powered through streaming, with the LP’s 17 tracks clocking up 324.31 million streams.
Their highest sales week of the year ranking was short-lived, however, as Beyoncé came in with a whopping 407k units sold this week with her new album, Cowboy Carter.

The pair are just behind her at No. 2, though, bringing in an additional 131k units of We Don’t Trust You for its second week.
In other news, fans will be able to catch Metro Boomin live in Egypt at the end of the month for a performance at the historic Pyramids of Giza.

On April 2, the Missouri native announced his plans on Twitter with a comic-book-inspired graphic featuring him in front of the ancient four-sided structures as well as the Great Sphynx.
“In other news I’m doing a show at the Pyramids in Giza,” he wrote along with mind-blown emojis.

The set is scheduled to take place at the Kundalini Grand Pyramids on April 30. The event was sold out in under 15 minutes, however, so fans are out of luck if they didn’t secure tickets already.
