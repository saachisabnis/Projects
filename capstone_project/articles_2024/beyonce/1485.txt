They're coming with me to London, Greece, and Italy next. 
Travel + Leisure / Tyler Roeland
 There’s nothing quite like experiencing Europe without the crowds and heat. That’s why, while many travelers wax poetic about Sardinia’s glittering coastline and Greece’s ancient ruins in the height of July, I’ve been excitedly counting down until shoulder season begins. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good European summer: the buzzing of streets and outdoor bistros, a beach club crowd enjoying a live DJ, and the balmy evenings just before dinner with a gelato or Aperol Spritz in hand. But fall brings with it a special kind of energy: slower — though hardly boring — with more forgiving temperatures and room to roam. 

 Soon, I’ll check into London’s iconic landmark hotel, The Beaumont Mayfair, and after that, I'll be gearing up for an e-biking adventure in Greece with Butterfield & Robinson, a luxury tour operator that tapped a former Olympian to take guests along the northern part of the country; it includes visits to Mount Olympus and Zagori for a truffle hunt. Then, I’ve got my eye on Italy’s northern Piedmont region, especially the leathery, cherry-tinged Barolos from the Ceretto family. Each location calls for its own unique set of clothing, shoes, and accessories, but don't fret, I've got my international trip packing list down to a science. 

 Below, you'll find the 14 items I swear by for any fall European trip, ranging from that I never a super soft button-down shirt that is the perfect layering option for any season to a convertible travel backpack that’s roomy enough to give even the best carry-on bags some competition. 

Amazon
 A comfortable pair of pants is a must, and while I never go anywhere without my leopard-printed pair from Unsubscribed, I have a feeling these Libin trousers will be just as free-flowing and stylish on my Euro trip. To dress the look up, I like to pair these pants with an elegant top to make street-side-bistro-in-Paris chic, but you can wear them with just about any blouse, tee, or sweater in your suitcase. 

Amazon
 This long-sleeved shirt from Free Fly is thick enough to keep me warm in milder temperatures, but also breathable and sun-ready with UPF 50+ protection for warmer days. Best of all, the bamboo viscose material is so buttery soft that I could sleep in this shirt, and I often wear it on long flights.

Athleta
 I now understand why this Athleta Pranayama Restore Wrap receives praise from just about everyone who wears it. When I have it on, I feel the closest I’ve come to feeling swaddled like a baby. Relaxed with plenty of room to move, the super soft rib texture provides just the right amount of warmth for those not quite cold-not quite hot fall temperatures. Falling below the waist, it provides great coverage and comes in a variety of colors like clover berry and smoky rose. I like to pair it with a loose-fitting pair of jeans or my Halo Essential Wide-Leg Sweats from Vuori on those long plane rides to Europe. 

American Eagle
 The importance of layering while traveling cannot be understated. I’ve been able to completely avoid those bulky jackets that take up so much luggage space by choosing the right items that double up well to provide warmth. This waffle shirt from Aerie fits the bill with a soft textured fabric that’s warm and loose-fitting. Oversized chest pockets and cuff buttons give the shirt personality, as well as a range of colors like the rich, fall-ready mauve tone. I'm also a big fan of Aerie’s Long Weekend Sweatshirt for maximum coverage and softness, which is often lacking in sweatshirt styles. I like to pack it for cycling days through Europe. 

Amazon
 Functional and stylishly cut, this short-sleeved ribbed knit T-shirt from Amazon-favorite brand Sampeel has a great stretch fit and comes in a variety of colors that make it a staple piece. Wear it with your favorite pair of jeans and a blazer for a chic casual look.

Everlane
 A classic linen blazer is the perfect fall travel companion. Heavy enough to function as a jacket and light enough to be stylishly paired with your favorite dress or jeans, this option from Everlane is my top pick. The two-button closure and oversized fit make it easy to dress up or down. I love pairing the Cornstalk Chambray color with a chic, gold necklace from Catbird for a little glow. You can get this blazer on sale now for $107. 

Everlane
 Another staple from Everlane, this boxy sweater is made with 100 percent organic cotton and is easy to layer over shirts and dresses. The drop shoulders and crewneck line give it a relaxed fit that takes me from my hotel to my favorite café without having to wear a jacket.

Amazon
 An easy transition piece from day to night, this high-waisted satin midi skirt allows for great ease of movement and matches well with a cute camisole or cardigan when you want to sightsee, eat at a trendy restaurant, or grab drinks. It comes in several fall-friendly colors and patterns, including burgundy and leopard print.

Amazon
 Temperate weather during this time of year makes walking one of my favorite activities. These hiking sandals from Keen have a high rebound cushioning system that provides the underfoot comfort I need, particularly when going uphill. Adjustable bungee cords make them easy to take off or put on, and I love how lightweight they are. They are also great for any water activities and come with quick dry washable webbing straps.

Amazon
 Shoutout to my iPhone's iCloud storage because the number of photos I take during travel is extreme. That habit creates a heavy hit on my phone’s battery, and that’s when this Charmast Portable Charger comes in to save the day. The built-in cable can take battery life from 20 percent to 65 percent in just half an hour, and a convenient lanyard loop makes it easy to carry.

Cuyana
 I became a fan of Cuyana’s bags when the first iteration of its beloved system zipper tote came out years ago. I was so thrilled to recently see that a new version had come out with the same buttery, Italian leather and secure zip closure that makes it my favorite travel bag companion. This bag is fully customizable, with organizational add-ons that can be snapped on and off of it as well, including a laptop sleeve and pouches. 

Away
 When I traveled to Europe over the summer, this outdoor convertible backpack from Away was the only thing that helped prevent me from losing my mind as I checked into airports every few days. I could go on and on about this option being perfect as a carry-on, but I'll start with the fact that it’s big enough to hold all your essentials and an interior compression strap makes it easy to store at least three packing cubes full of clothing. There’s also an exterior water bottle pocket and removable padded straps that allow it to transition from a backpack to a duffel bag.

Amazon
 Jet-setting from country to country leaves plenty of room for lost items, which is why I recommend keeping valuables like your passport extra protected in something like this leather case with an Apple AirTag holder. In fact, make sure you grab the Apple AirTag four-pack so you can stick these genius trackers in your suitcase, travel bag, and wallet too. 

Amazon
 Different countries use different plugs, which can be a headache if you're not prepared. Make sure you have a universal travel adapter handy so you're prepared for any outlet situation. This top-rated version from Ceptics comes with various attachments and two USB outlets so you can charge multiple devices at once. 

Cecred
 It’s no secret to anyone who knows me how much I love Beyoncé. Still, I’ve never been the type of consumer who automatically supports any product a celebrity creates. This travel-sized nourishing hair oil from the singer’s hair care line, Cécred, however, made me understand the hype. My hair can often be dull during the fall season, and it’s hard to find products in Europe that speak to my hair type, so I never leave home without this portable gem. It features 13 oils, including sweet almond and baobab, that keep my hair hydrated and also free of silicone and parabens.

Amazon
 I'm never one to leave home without sun protection, and this game-changing sunscreen from Supergoop keeps my skin protected without causing that dreadful gray undertone that some sunscreens cause. Antioxidant-rich and oil-free, it also helps me to avoid breakouts and even has a pore minimizer priming effect.
