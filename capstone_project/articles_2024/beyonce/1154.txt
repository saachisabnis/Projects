She put a feminine twist on this summer’s western trend
There’s no question that western clothing is having its moment. Celebrities from Beyoncé to Rihanna are all cashing in on the cowboy trend—but, for Bella Hadid, it’s also a lifestyle.
The supermodel has been participating in various horse-riding competitions since she reportedly moved to Fort Worth, Texas, to be closer to boyfriend (and real-life cowboy) Adan Banuelos. Now, in new photos, she swapped her rodeo gear for a more delicate outfit.

In a post shared to the Instagram account of her fragrance line, Orebella, Hadid poses in a golf cart while wearing a dainty white nightgown with lacy scalloped sleeves and a ruched neckline. The dress’ hemline fell above her knees, allowing her to show off a pair of earthy brown cowboy boots. Hadid accessorized the look with other grounded elements, from burgundy and sage green beaded bracelets to an array of chunky rings.
“Farm fairy 🧚🏻🌾,” the caption read.
Besides getting in the rodeo, Hadid has also been kept busy as of late launching Orebella. She recently talked with Harper’s Bazaar about what inspired her to create the brand.
“I never had a fragrance I was so obsessed with that made me feel unique and different. I started making my own and started making decks about it,” she said. “Then, all of a sudden, I had conversations with myself about my future and, like, what excited me, and it really was bringing something that was so personal to me to the world, and having the opportunity for people to see my heart and my brain.”
She added, “Creating Orebella was the best form of therapy, especially just using my brain again and educating myself on different things and knowing the business behind all of this, but also being able to stay true to who I am.”
