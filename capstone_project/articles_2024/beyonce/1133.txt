Whitney Houston in the film "The Bodyguard," 1992.
Just like every decade before it — and since — the ‘90s sounded completely different from all other musical eras. It was an incredibly raw time in the music industry, with new genres popping up and breaking out. Countless hits from that period are still regarded as favorites among those who were there at the time, and also by millions who have heard them and fallen in love with them in the years since... but some stand out as particularly special.
Hip-hop was growing in popularity, and moving to a much more “real” place. While there were still remnants of the more lighthearted, fun side of the style — see MC Hammer’s “U Can’t Touch This” — rappers were more interested in telling the public what life was like for many Black people in the country, which wasn’t always as sunny.
Rock had been growing darker and harder for decades, and that trend continued in the ‘90s as well. Grunge, hard rock and metal grew in their reach and became bigger than ever before.
At the same time, electronic instruments entered the fray and completely changed how producers, songwriters and artists made dance and pop music. A line can be traced directly from Madonna’s “Vogue” to Britney Spears’ “Hit Me Baby One More Time,” with both becoming huge successes.
There are countless amazing songs that were released in the ‘90s, but for this list, we’ll focus on the 50 that have stood the test of time, that altered history, and that are simply, undeniably, great.
Dr. Dre's “Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang” introduced the world to G-funk — a subgenre of gangsta rap, which became very popular in the ‘90s — and solidified Dre's status as a hip-hop icon. The song's laid-back groove and infectious hooks became synonymous with West Coast rap.
“Intergalactic” by the Beastie Boys defied genres, blending hip-hop with electronic elements to create a truly groundbreaking sound. With its irresistible rhythm and memorable hooks, the Beastie Boys showed what was possible with hip-hop, which by this point, was breaking off into many different subgenres as it became more and more ubiquitous.
In “Santeria” by Sublime, the band effortlessly blends reggae rhythms with punk rock attitude, creating a sound that's uniquely their own. Like so many other artists from the ‘90s, the group was able to create a sound and a style that was wholly their own, and it catapulted them to fame — even if much of their success followed the group’s disbandment after the lead singer passed away.
In “What's Up?” by 4 Non Blondes, the lead singer belts out existential questions that many can relate to. The song's unforgettable chorus has made it a staple for sing-alongs and karaoke nights everywhere. Its catchy melody has earned it a cult following since its release in the early ‘90s.
When “Black Hole Sun” blasted onto the scene, it was like nothing anyone had ever heard before. The Chris Cornell-led Soundgarden took the grunge sound they were known for and twisted it into something dark, dreamy and downright mesmerizing, which also helped them continue their run as the grunge genre died down.
Weezer's “Buddy Holly” isn't your average alt-rock anthem — it's a quirky, nostalgic trip back to the 1950s. With its catchy hooks and geeky charm, it's no wonder it captured the hearts of listeners everywhere. Lead singer Rivers Cuomo was a perfect fit for the song, which seemed to compare him to the late Holly in a fun way.
What helped make Red Hot Chili Peppers so famous is the fact that they were making music that simply didn’t sound like what anyone else was producing. Their signature style was wholly unique, and tracks like “Under the Bridge” showed that a new voice had arrived and would not be imitated.
Puff Daddy & Faith Evans' collaboration with 112, “I'll Be Missing You,” is a poignant reflection on loss and longing. Through its heartfelt lyrics and soulful melody, the song pays homage to the late Notorious B.I.G. while expressing the pain of his absence. It showed that Puff Daddy — as he was then known — not only understood rap, but how to craft a hit that brought hip-hop to the masses in a meaningful way.
'90s rock staples Hootie & the Blowfish count many wins in their discography, but “Only Wanna Be with You” stands out as the loveliest. With its soulful vocals and catchy guitar riffs, the song transports listeners to a place of romantic yearning and emotional vulnerability. Lead singer Darius Rucker’s unique vocals were heard on the radio throughout the decade.
“Enter Sandman” by Metallica wasn't just another metal song, it was the sound of the '90s hard rock scene. With its thunderous riffs and intense vocals, it changed what so many rock bands were doing — or trying to do — at the time. Decades later, Metallica remains one of the most important and beloved hard rock outfits making music.
When Pearl Jam released “Jeremy,” they didn't shy away from the tough stuff. The single tackled the heavy topics of teen suicide and bullying head-on, with lyrics that hit hard and a melody that stayed with you. Despite stirring up some controversy, it connected with many listeners, earning praise from critics and becoming a huge rock hit.
The Backstreet Boys' “I Want It That Way” was a pop masterpiece that captured the hearts of fans worldwide with its infectious melody and lyrics are deliciously sappy. The hit topped charts globally and became one of the bestselling singles of all time. Its iconic music video, featuring the group in an airport hangar, became synonymous with the boy band era of the late ‘90s that they helped develop.
Boyz II Men's “End of the Road” was a soulful ballad that captured the pain of heartbreak and loss. The group wasn’t like other boy bands — they were more like an all-male vocal troupe. Their talent was in their incredible ability to harmonize, and “End of the Road” was one of many hits from the group that lived on the Hot 100 for a long, long time.
Beck's “Loser” is a quirky and unconventional track that catapulted the man behind it to fame in the mid-1990s. Released in 1994, the song blends elements of folk, hip-hop, and lo-fi rock, creating a distinctive sound that defies categorization. With its surreal lyrics and slacker ethos, "Loser" struck a chord with Generation X and became an anthem for the disillusioned and disaffected.
Countless bands have Green Day to thank for helping bring pop-punk to the forefront. 30 years later, the group is still making the same style of music, and it’s still rocking just as hard. “Basket Case” somehow managed to blend the ferocity and fury of punk with top 40-ready hooks, making the angsty tune an unlikely, and rollicking, hit.
“U Can't Touch This” by MC Hammer was the ultimate hip-hop jam that took over radios with its irresistible beats. It skyrocketed to the No. 1 spot on music charts globally, bagging Hammer momentary fame — though it would later go on to brand him something of a one-trick pony. The legendary music video, showcasing Hammer in his iconic parachute pants, is peak ‘90s.
Blur's “Song 2” was a high-octane blast of rock energy that has become an unceasing backing track for sports events and commercials. The song's infectious guitar riff and frenetic pace earned Blur mainstream success. With deceptively simple lyrics — the chorus is just “woo hoo” — some underestimate the tune.
Foo Fighters' “Everlong” soared as a rock anthem, capturing the electrifying essence of falling in love. While the band, which was created out of the ashes of Nirvana, would go on to score countless hits and become rock gods, “Everlong” remains perhaps their signature hit. In fact, to this day, it regularly hits No. 1 on at least one Billboard chart.
In the mid-'90s, The Cranberries dropped their haunting anthem “Zombie.” The powerful track, fronted and powered by Dolores O'Riordan's piercing vocals, didn't just make itself known in the alternative rock scene, it became a staple of rock radio. These days, it picks up again every Halloween, reminding millions of just how fantastic it is.
U2 made their name in the ‘80s and after only a few albums, became one of the biggest bands on the planet. They trafficked in arena-sized anthems that straddled the line between ballad and pop hit. “One” continued their winning streak and became one of their most successful releases in a decade that was otherwise somewhat quiet for the Irish heroes.
Disney enjoyed an incredibly fruitful period in the ‘90s, when some of their animated films — The Lion King, Mulan, and Pocahontas, among others — produced many of the company’s biggest and most memorable songs. Included in that roundup is “A Whole New World,” which became a huge chart hit when Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle invited listeners on a magical carpet ride through the world of Aladdin. It won Song of the Year at the Grammys — the only Disney song to do so — and remains one of the best of the best from the animation studio.
Radiohead unveiled “Creep,” and at first, it was not a hit. Despite a slow start, constant radio spins turned it into a favorite for those grappling with self-doubt — which is seemingly everyone who loves alternative rock. The song dives deep into the soul, resonating with anyone who's ever felt out of place. It’s odd and unsettling, but somehow, relatable.
Mariah Carey's “Fantasy” blended pop and R&B seamlessly, and it showcased her incredible vocal range and ability to write catchy melodies. The song's upbeat tempo and unbeatable hooks helped it become a Billboard chart staple, It stands out as one of Carey's biggest hits of the decade, which is saying something, as she was the biggest pop star of the era.
When R.E.M. released “Losing My Religion,” it sounds and felt like nothing else out there. The captivating track, with its haunting melody and cryptic lyrics, spoke to the heart. It was unusual, and one of many alternative tunes from the ‘90s that have never been replicated, as it took a stroke of genius to make it work the first time around.
Janet Jackson's “Together Again” was a message of love and resilience, wrapped in a pop tune the masses could fall in love with. It celebrated unity in the midst of loss, finding optimism in the darkest of times. A vibrant tribute where Jackson honors friends lost to AIDS through dance, many who enjoy the cut may not even realize how deep it really is.
When Sinead O'Connor sang “Nothing Compares 2 U,” she poured her heart out for the world to hear. Her haunting rendition of Prince’s song and vulnerable delivery spoke volumes, touching the souls of listeners everywhere. The music video was a minimalist masterpiece, featuring O'Connor's tearful performance, and it became an iconic representation of heartbreak and longing.
When it comes to capturing the essence of youth and nostalgia, Smashing Pumpkins' “1979” can’t be beat. Its weightlessness and melodic charm found an audience with listeners worldwide, earning it both praise from critics and success when it came to sales and the charts. For a while, the Smashing Pumpkins ranked among the most-applauded alt-rock favorites.
Fiona Apple's “Criminal” was a dark and seductive alt ballad that featured themes of guilt and desire with its haunting melody and confessional lyrics. The song's raw emotion and Apple's sultry vocals were on full display — as was plenty more in the provocative music video. Despite outrage over her suggestive poses and childlike appearance, it captured a mood that was rarely depicted so perfectly.
Back in the '90s, when you heard “The Sign” by Ace of Base, you knew it was time to hit the dance floor. The infectious pop anthem had everyone moving with its catchy beat and irresistible hooks. It was an early example of how electronic instruments and sounds would come to dominate music, and it continued the tradition of forward-thinking pop coming from Scandinavia.
With its upbeat tempo and catchy chorus, “Lovefool” by The Cardigans is the ultimate guilty pleasure from the ‘90s. The song's infectious energy and memorable hooks make it impossible not to sing along to. It is recognizable from the moment the first note hits, and it stands out from every other tune from that era because of the interesting production choices that were made.
Cher's “Believe” was a groundbreaking dance-pop behemoth that introduced Auto-Tune to the mainstream and revitalized the singer’s career. The song's pulsating beat and insanely catchy hook made it impossible to avoid — not that anyone wanted to avoid it, that is. For decades, Cher held the record as the oldest female musician with a Hot 100 No. 1 hit thanks to this tune’s incredible commercial success.
“Wonderwall” became an anthem for a generation with its soaring melodies and heartfelt lyrics. Some fans found real meaning in the track, while others simply loved it for its catchy songwriting. The track, among many others from the sibling-led Oasis, made the band one of the bestselling in U.K. history and took them around the globe. Its sing-along chorus made it a staple of ‘90s nostalgia.
When Britpop was all the rage, The Verve unleashed their magnum opus, “Bitter Sweet Symphony.” Blending elements of rock, pop and orchestral music, it defied conventions and captured the imagination of listeners worldwide. But what really makes "Bitter Sweet Symphony" special is its backstory. Built on a sample from The Rolling Stones' "The Last Time," the song sparked a legal battle that threatened to overshadow its success and saw all royalties — for a time, anyway — going to the legendary rock band instead of the group that made it fresh and new again.
Few people realize that “All I Wanna Do,” Sheryl Crow’s breakout hit, was largely adapted from a poem by Wyn Cooper called, simply, “Fun.” The track was a smash, and it introduced the young Crow to America. She’d go on to produce many hits, but this first tune, which won Record of the Year at the Grammys, started it all and remains a quirky ‘90s favorite.
The Spice Girls didn't just release a song with “Wannabe” — they unleashed a phenomenon. The single is one of the best examples in history of the fact that pop songs don’t have to make a lick of sense, they just need to be an earworm. In the years since it dropped, the track has been made fun of for some of its lines — “If you wannabe my lover, you gotta get with my friends,” in particular — while also being celebrated for launching the girl group to superstardom.
Before “Say My Name,” Destiny's Child had already hit the Billboard charts and earned Grammy nominations, but this R&B/pop smash took them to a whole new level. The track showed that these women weren’t just a flash in the pan, they were going to change the world. The single won the girl group their first Grammy, and lead singer Beyoncé would go on to break the record for the most Grammy awards of all time.
Like the Goo Goo Dolls, Third Eye Blind were steady hitmakers throughout the ‘90s, with a string of radio smashes. The best and biggest among them was “Semi-Charmed Life,” which had millions trying to sing along to its rap-like verses. Thankfully, the chorus is easy for any and all to remember, which made it a huge win.
It was a bold move for Tupac Shakur to open his single “California Love” with an instrument known as a talkbox, as it could have been seen as silly. Thankfully, the genius of the man who went by the name 2Pac was recognized in its time, and the ode to living and loving on the West Coast made it massive.
Listeners were enchanted by The Fugees' take on Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly With His Song,” which was characterized by soulful vocals and a minimalistic approach. It was a risky cover, as the original was so adored, but it was worth the gamble. The Fugees weren’t together long, but all three members went on to enjoy solo careers, and this track remains a classic.
Britney Spears skyrocketed to fame thanks to “...Baby One More Time,” a hit single that blended catchy tunes with her “not that innocent” persona — something she’d sing about a little while later. Despite sparking some controversy with its provocative music video, which showcased Spears in a daring schoolgirl outfit, it also firmly established her as a pop culture icon.
After finding incredible success and acclaim as one-third of The Fugees, Lauryn Hill broke out on her own — and things went even better than before. Even when compared to the best soul hits ever, Lauryn Hill's “Doo Wop (That Thing)” stands tall. The single was featured on her only solo album thus far, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which won Album of the Year at the Grammys and is still regarded as one of the greatest releases of all time.
When it comes to the essence of the ‘90s, few songs are as perfectly fit as Alanis Morissette's “Ironic.” And yes, the singer knows that many of the things she sings about aren’t actually ironic. The track was one of many major hits from her album Jagged Little Pill, which is still seen as one of the best rock albums of all time.
In the '90s, Nirvana dropped “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” setting the stage for the grunge wave, which they helped kick off. The track, packed with raw power and a rebellious vibe, shot up the charts, turning Nirvana into superstars and marking them as one of the decade's big hitters. The single remains perhaps the most famous example of a grunge classic.
When TLC unleashed “Waterfalls,” it was a game-changer. This song didn't just make noise, it sent a message, which was a hallmark of some of the best songs from the ‘90s. Its heartfelt lyrics and captivating melody reached fans everywhere, and it became a smash with something to say.
Santana's “Smooth,” a collaboration with Matchbox 20 star Rob Thomas, is still played on radio stations regularly to this day. The track resuscitated the guitar player’s career and gave him a completely unexpected hit. The tune was so powerful, it helped Santana sweep the Grammys, and it ended the ‘90s on a strong note.
One of the biggest hits of the decade, when “Iris” by the Goo Goo Dolls came on the radio, you couldn't help but get swept away by its raw emotion. It’s overwrought and so clear in its ambition to grab at the heartstrings of the listener — but it does its job so well, it doesn’t matter. The Goo Goo Dolls enjoyed one of the most successful runs of any rock band in the ‘90s, with “Iris” being their masterpiece.
Believe it or not, Celine Dion didn’t even want to record “My Heart Will Go On,” but her husband and manager stated she should give it a go. The song was penned for the movie Titanic, and director James Cameron wasn’t crazy about it either. While many didn’t love the idea of the cut, it became one of the biggest No. 1 smashes of the decade, and remains one of the most memorable tunes to win Best Original Song at the Academy Awards.
No Doubt's “Don't Speak” was a heartbreaking ballad that explored the pain of a relationship falling apart. The song's emotional lyrics and Gwen Stefani's poignant vocals, were so powerful and huge, it felt like it was always destined to become a generation-defining release. The track told the story of two members from the band’s split, which made it all the more meaningful to them.
Madonna's “Vogue” revolutionized dance music with its infectious beat and iconic choreography. The song spent weeks at the top of the charts and earned Madonna a reputation as someone who could not only craft smashes, but discover and reveal sounds and communities living outside the public eye. Its stylish music video, featuring voguing dancers and glamorous fashion, remains a cultural touchstone.
Whitney Houston's rendition of Dolly Parton’s single “I Will Always Love You” captivated audiences with its emotional depth and her incredible vocal prowess. The song, featured in the film The Bodyguard, spent a record-setting 14 weeks atop the Hot 100 chart. Houston's stirring performance and the song's timeless message of love and loss have made it an enduring classic.
