As the first quarter of the 21st Century draws to a close, Billboard counted down the 25 greatest pop stars of the past 25 years as chosen by their staff. On Tuesday (December 3), the publication revealed that Beyoncé topped their list as the greatest pop star of the 21st Century. Billboard said Beyoncé was selected “based on her full 25 years of influence, evolution and impact.” On March 2, 2024, Beyoncé topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for the 12th time this century with “Texas Hold ‘Em.” While her second career No. 1 hit came at the start of the century on March 18, 2000, when Destiny’s Child topped the Hot 100 with “Say My Name.” Beyoncé has dominated the charts and the music headlines over the past 25 years, always remaining culturally and commercially relevant while staying a step ahead of her contemporaries and critics. “There are no flop eras for Bey, no periods where she disappeared for a half-decade,” Billboard wrote. “There are only varying degrees of winning for over two decades.” (Billboard)
