In Disney’s "Mufasa: The Lion King," the music plays as vital a role as the story itself, weaving emotion and depth into the tale of the Pride Lands. With Lin-Manuel Miranda contributing his creative genius, the prequel brings fresh melodies to the saga while honoring the musical legacy of the franchise. For Miranda, the project offered not only a chance to craft memorable songs but also to explore the rich, untold stories of its characters.
One character who captured Miranda’s imagination is Eshe, Scar’s mother and the adoptive figure who also shaped Mufasa’s journey. Played by Thandiwe Newton, Eshe brings a grandeur and complexity that Miranda believes deserves more exploration.
“She’s such an incredible character,” Miranda says. “Without giving away spoilers, Eshe is both Scar’s mother and Mufasa’s adoptive mother. Her presence carries such weight and dignity, and her performance is stunning. I’d love to explore her story musically because there’s so much depth there that I feel we’ve only scratched the surface.”
Though Eshe didn’t get an original song in this film, Miranda is optimistic about future opportunities to expand on her narrative. He also expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with another iconic mother-daughter duo if the opportunity arises.
“I would love to explore a record with Beyoncé and Blue Ivy if another installment happens,” Miranda shares. “Is there anything better than when Beyoncé revealed Blue Ivy at the Renaissance concert on the word kinfolk, and then she popped out? That’s the level of artistry I aspire to. I’d have to earn that moment—or I’d have to go home. It’s pretty hard to top.”
Miranda’s admiration for Beyoncé doesn’t end there. When asked to describe the essence of "Mufasa: The Lion King" in a single song, he pointed to “OTHERSIDE,” from Beyoncé’s The Lion King: The Gift.
“‘OTHERSIDE’ is the perfect song to describe this film,” Miranda says. “It’s one of her most slept-on tracks, but it embodies the themes of hope, legacy, and emotional resilience that are so central to this story.”
For Miranda, crafting the music for Mufasa: The Lion King was about striking a balance between honoring the beloved score of the original The Lion King and adding something fresh and meaningful. The result is a soundtrack that pushes the story forward while celebrating its roots.
“You want the music to serve the story, and you want it to feel like it’s part of this rich legacy,” he explains. “At the same time, there’s a joy in adding your own voice to that tradition. That’s what makes this project so exciting.”
Fans can experience Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical contributions and the emotional power of "Mufasa: The Lion King" when it roars into theaters on December 20th.
