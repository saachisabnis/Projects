Back in 2019, nothing was bigger — or more controversial — in country music than Lil Nas X's viral hit, "Old Town Road."
The Atlanta-based rapper blazed onto the country social media space with the song, which paired a hip-hop beat with traditional country lyricism and imagery, and "Old Town Road" quickly began to organically rise up the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart — until Billboard removed it from consideration, deciding that the song wasn't sufficiently country to merit inclusion on the chart.
What ensued was a hot debate about what exactly defines a song as country, and whether Billboard's decision had more to do with race than it did with the song itself. Billy Ray Cyrus got involved in a remix, and everyone from Jason Aldean to Keith Urban to Sam Elliott name-checked the song with covers, mentions and social media posts.
Amid all the controversy and hype, Lil Nas X says he felt a little embarrassed of his big hit. In a new TikTok post, the rapper shares a cheeky reflection admitting that he thought the song was "cringe" — and saying he's got a different perspective on it now, five years later.
"Me suddenly realizing I spent 5 years thinking my own song was cringe because ugly losers who will never make anything as great and game-changing as it got into my head," he wrote in the post. over a video of himself dancing to the Billy Ray Cyrus remix of "Old Town Road."
"Cringe" or not, the success of "Old Town Road" has been long-lasting and undeniable. In 2021, it became the most Platinum-certified song in the history of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA.)
It's also one of only eight country songs to ever sell more than 10 million copies.
