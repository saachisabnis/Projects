The 13th annual Touring Career Workshop (TCW) is set for Nov. 12 at the Soundcheck Annex in Nashville.
Attendees will explore topics including mental, physical, and fiscal health, work/life balance, crafting a solid business plan and securing a coveted gig through engaging breakout sessions. Registration for the free event is now open. For more information, click here.
Co-created by Chris Lisle, Owner of concert event design and production management firm CLLD, and industry professional Erik Parker as a way to educate, mentor and provide access to experts and professional resources, TWC has grown into the country’s largest gathering of touring professionals and those interested in careers in the industry.
Veteran tour manager Marty Hom will serve as the 2024 keynote speaker. Hom has worked with Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Lionel Richie, Beyoncé and Janet Jackson, among others, for more than 40 years.
“This year’s theme—Reset—is appropriate as we dive into where we are as an industry and what the future looks like as these post-COVID years have been a rollercoaster in a lot of ways,” says Lisle. “With a storied keynote speaker and impactful breakout sessions, this year’s event is shaping up to be our best yet.”
New this year is the Reboot and Refresh: Career Essentials Lab, a pre-event session, taking place from 2–4 p.m., that will feature a resume consultant, a financial advisor offering customized spending plans and a photographer snapping headshots, all for a nominal fee.
Additionally, TCW’s All Access Program, which offers four free, confidential counseling sessions with pre-approved therapists, has expanded rapidly and is now offered to all artists, bands, crews and staffs at festivals, including Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits (ACL), Faster Horses, CMA Fest, and to participants and crews at the PGA Simmons Open.
