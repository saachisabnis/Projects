Vitoria Bueno is 11 years old, stands 2 feet 10 inches tall, speaks fluent Portuguese, and dotes on her Pomeranian, Toby.
She’s also a TikTok star — dancing her way into the hearts of 1.4 million followers and raising awareness about osteogenesis imperfecta, the rare brittle bone disorder she battles.
“Not a lot of people knew about this condition,” Vitoria said in a Zoom interview this week from her home in Marlborough. “I would like to show people what it’s like having this condition or what it is.”
Like so many TikTok-obsessed tweens, Vitoria’s account is filled mostly with so-called get ready with me clips where she puts on makeup, goes through her skin care routine, and styles her hair. But she also sprinkles in a dance video now and then.

“I like to inspire people,” Vitoria said. “I’ve been dancing since I was 5.”
Vitoria launched her TikTok account in November, a few weeks before she underwent an almost 12-hour surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital to correct an 82-degree curve in her spine. She already had rods in her thighs, shins, and upper arms to prevent deformities from broken bones.
To prepare for surgery, Vitoria wore a halo device fixed to her skull and linked to a tall, wheeled frame to help straighten her spine. Her movements unencumbered, she took a moment to shoot a dance video, busting moves like a backup dancer on tour with Beyoncé.
The video became a sensation on TikTok, drawing nearly 73 million views and 8.2 million likes.
“She’s a very vivacious, energetic, fun-loving, and also incredibly smart and insightful 11-year-old girl,” said Errol Mortimer, Vitoria’s pediatric orthopedic surgeon at UMass Memorial Medical Center. “Among all the kids that I know with osteogenesis imperfecta, she has taken it in stride as well as or better than anybody I know.”

Vitoria has Type III osteogenesis imperfecta, which affects fewer than one in every 100,000 people. Type III causes small, brittle bones that “melt like marshmallows,” said Mortimer, who has performed all but one of her 15 or so surgeries. The condition also affects bone growth, and those with the disease have a smaller stature.

Vitoria is all too familiar with the pain of a broken bone. She and her mother, Maria Vania Bueno, have “lost count” of how many fractures Vitoria has suffered but estimate the number to be about 55.
“It’s hard doing everything,” she said. “You need to be careful with everything.”
Even bouncing on a friend’s trampoline can be difficult,  Vitoria said.
“I’ll just start crying,” Vitoria said. “I got scared, not because it hurts, but because I got so scared because I know when I break it’s the worst.”
None of it stops Vitoria, her mother said. She described her daughter as “strong,” “happy,” and with “a lot of energy,” as Vitoria translated from Portuguese.
As a fifth grader, Vitoria has no problem managing her schoolwork and still has plenty of time to put together her “get ready with me” videos for 1.4 million people, she said.
Next year, she moves on to middle school, a leap she describes as “terrifying.”
Beyond school, Vitoria has big plans for herself. She wants to be an osteogenesis imperfecta specialist, performing surgeries and helping people with the condition.

“So I can take care of people like me,” Vitoria said. “I actually know a whole lot of stuff about my syndrome. I can tell parents how it is, and I can explain.”
Vitoria hopes someday to work at Boston Children’s Hospital or at UMass Memorial Medical Center.
“If anyone can do it, it’s her,” Mortimer said.
