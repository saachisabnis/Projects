Vice President Kamala Harris is set to deliver the closing argument for her presidential campaign on Tuesday at the site of where former President Donald Trump delivered a speech before the riot on the U.S. Capitol.
Harris aimed to underscore the contrast between her campaign and Trump's by delivering her keynote address from the Ellipse‚Äîthe same location where, on January 6, 2021, Trump debunked false claims about the 2020 election, fueling a mob that stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.
With just a week remaining until Election Day, Harris is set to deliver a 7:30 p.m. ET speech from the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. She is expected to focus on policies that improve Americans' lives while accusing her Republican counterpart of running for personal gain.
Harris's address follows a recent trip to Texas, a Republican stronghold, where she joined music icon Beyonc√© to highlight the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. That appearance was part of a broader effort to connect with voters ahead of Election Day.
During Tuesday's speech, Harris is anticipated to outline a pragmatic, forward-focused agenda, emphasizing her economic proposals and reaffirming her commitment to expanding access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion.
While speaking about the vice president's upcoming speech, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said, "It's a place that certainly we believe helps crystalize the choice in this election."
Dillon also noted that the site of the speech will show "a stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he's used his power for bad."
While speaking to reporters on Monday, Harris said, "There's a big difference between he and I," alluding to Trump.
"If he were elected, on day one he's going to sit in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected, which I fully expect to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list," she said.
In remarks to reporters from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday morning, Trump criticized Harris' upcoming speech, accusing her of failing to focus on the everyday challenges and issues that matter most to Americans.
Trump claimed that Harris "keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record's horrible," referencing her repeated warnings about comments from his former chief of staff, who alleged that Trump had spoken admiringly of the Nazi leader during his time in office.
