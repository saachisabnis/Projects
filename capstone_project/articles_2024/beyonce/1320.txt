They are loud and proud about their political picks – and they all rake in millions – but it turns out some celebrities are failing to put their money where their mouths are. 
Hollywood Democrats are often more vocal about their political beliefs than their counterparts, yet donation records suggest they are also the tightwads of the bunch.
In fact, there is no public record of the biggest pop star in the world putting more than a mere $15 towards her beloved political party. 
Meanwhile, celebrity jailbirds — such as disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein — are surprisingly among the most generous donors, and all seem to lean left.  
Big-money Republicans appear to be more willing to open their wallets – but maybe not the ones you'd expect. 
DailyMail.com has analyzed donation records collected by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to rank the most benevolent – and penny-pinching  among the openly political celebs.
The following figures are based on personal donations made in the celebrity's name, and do not account for funds they may have contributed through other channels, organizations, or third-party entities. 
DANA WHITE – $2.35M
The UFC chief has become the GOP's celebrity sugar daddy based on his generous donations to Republican campaigns dating back to 2005. 
Records show White has made a total of 139 donations in his name, including a hefty $100,000 contribution to Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid in 2012.
He later topped that gift by giving $1million to Trump super PAC America First Action during the 2020 presidential campaign. 
As for this election year, White has splashed out over $920,000 on Republican causes, with only $14,900 of those funds going directly to Trump, according to records. 
Grapple king Dana White is the gift that keeps on giving for Donald Trump
ELON MUSK – $330,700
The tech mogul, 53, Musk has become one of Donald Trump's most prominent surrogates and fundraisers, speaking effusively of the GOP nominee at multiple rallies and even donating $75 million to his own pro-Trump super PAC. 
Most recently, Musk was a headliner at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York City, where he was joined by fellow big-name supporters including White, Tucker Carlson, and Hulk Hogan. 
The Tesla founder is reported to have given over $130million to Republican campaigns since turning to the GOP, but only $330,700 have been recorded as his personal donations this year, FEC filings show.  
Before this, the former liberal was an active Democratic donor, making 180 contributions ranging from $1,000 to $35,800 to Barack Obama's Victory Fund in 2012.

CLINT EASTWOOD – $26,000
The veteran actor and one-time mayor of Carmel, California, is a known conservative. Who can forget his turn talking to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention in 2012?
He has endorsed GOP presidential candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney in previous elections but he has now changed his registration from Republican to Libertarian.
Eastwood has a record of donating to Republican causes 11 times totaling $25,950, but has never publicly backed Trump as his party's nominee. 
His flow of dollars appears to have stopped when The Donald became president, according to FEC records. 
Clint Eastwood addressed an empty chair, supposedly representing Barack Obama, at the 2012 Republican National Convention
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER – $24,700
He's the Hollywood conservative who went on to become the two-term Republican governor of California from 2003 to 2011.
But the Austrian-born actor, 77, has flipped his switch this presidential election, announcing his support for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday. 
Records show Schwarzenegger has previously donated to Republican causes at least 24 times, with his last recorded contribution being a $2,700 gift to John Kasich's doomed 2016 presidential campaign. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger served as California's Republican governor for two terms from 2003 to 2011
Records show most of the former politician's other donations were worth $1,000 or under.   
The Terminator made a rare presidential endorsement six days before the election, expressing doubt about Trump's ability to unite and lead the country effectively during a second term. 
'I will always be an American before I am a Republican,' he said. 
Schwarzenegger had previously called Trump and Biden 'both flawed'. 
SEAN HANNITY – $14,000
The Fox News host is known as one Trump's best buddies in the media yet, there are no public records of a personal donation to the Republican candidate from Sean Hannity.  
Documents show the conservative pundit has previously splashed out $14,000 on four donations between 2005 and 2010.
JON VOIGHT – $12,900
He's an unabashed Trump fan and has been a Republican for decades, but Angelina Jolie's dad has not doled out anything in 12 years, according to the latest filings.
Of his nine donations, totaling $12,900, six were towards John McCain's failed presidential bid in 2008. 
Trump presented actor and friend Jon Voight with the National Medal of Arts in 2019 
KELSEY GRAMMER – $9,400
The television star made waves when he publicly reiterated his support for Donald Trump while promoting the Frasier reboot in a radio interview last December. 
But FEC filings only account for six donations Grammer has made to the Republican causes, with the last one in 2007 totaling $9,400.
DEAN CAIN – $6,506
The one-time Superman gave nine times between 1999 and 2021, totaling $6,506. 
The actor is a big Trump supporter, branding the former president 'iconic' for his reaction to his assassination attempt in July which left Trump with a bloody ear. 
Cain voiced his support for the Republican nominee, telling DailyMail.com at the time: 'The photo of him with a flag behind him, even upside down, a nation in distress with blood and saying 'fight, fight fight!''
Dean Cain believes Trump's actions after being shot in the ear in Pennsylvania was 'iconic'
MIKE TYSON – $1,450
In 2020, he was asked which corner he's in and didn't take too kindly to it, saying: 'I'm voting for Trump, so what's somebody going to do about it?' 
But he's given only once - a $1,450 donation to the campaign of Tom Patti for Congress in 2022 – Patti was an old training partner of Tyson's and later became his manager.
Iron Mike's donation didn't too too much good. Patti lost the election for the California seat in a landslide.
ROSEANNE BARR 
The embattled actress has been vocal about her love for Trump in the past, but we could find no record of her actually contributing financially to the Republican party. 
FEC records show Barr spent a few hundred dollars backing Democrat senate campaigns back in the nineties. 
She also gave herself $188.61 when she ran for president in 2012.
Roseanne was all smiles when she met Trump in 2023 – but her wallet stayed closed
HULK HOGAN
It seems no one can wrestle any cash out of him. 
Despite Hogan's outspoken support for Trump – most recently at the former president's New York City rally  the wrestling legend has never donated to the GOP, official figures show.
He appeared on stage at Trump's campaign event on Sunday night, struggling to rip off his 'Hulkmania' t-shirt, and declaring: 'Trump is the only man that can fix this country today.'
FOX NEWS FRIENDS 
Former Fox News stars Bill O'Reilly and Tucker Carlson haven't put their big money where their big mouths go, as they've never personally donated to the Grand Old Party.
Fox itself has strict rules about on-air hosts giving, but since neither is now employed by the network they would be free to contribute. 
CAITLYN JENNER 
The former reality show star is a known registered Republican but over the years has turned on Trump over his transgender views. 
Jenner, 75, has set up her own political movement Fairness First to keep biological males out of female sports, with records showing she has donated $5,000 to the cause, but zilch to Republicans.
GEORGE CLOONEY – $1.39M
It's no surprise Clooney is the Democratic party's most generous celebrity benefactor – giving 103 times – the highest donation being $500,000 to the Biden Victory Fund.
Two of the biggest celeb Democrat donors, George Clooney and Juli Roberts posed with two men who aren't on the ballot in June
But there's been no donations since, despite Gorgeous George's endorsement of Harris after he stuck the boot into Biden by penning a New York Times op-ed 'I love Joe Biden. But we need a new nominee'.
JULIA ROBERTS – $830,000
She's been busy this year, not making films, but handing out the cash. 
The Pretty Woman has been a generous donor to the Democrat cause this year, making 40 contributions worth a total of $830,000. 
The six-figure sum includes a hefty $500,000 gift to the Harris Victory Fund alone.
JENNIFER ANISTON – $145,529
Another famous leftie like Clooney, she's donated 18 times since 2008 – mainly to Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign and to 2020 election swing states. 
But like Clooney, she has no record of donating to a campaign in the upcoming election. 
ROBERT DE NIRO – $89,000
The Oscar winner has been dipping his hand in his pocket since 1995, giving $89,000 across 12 donations.
He has shelled out $63,305 for the current election campaign.
Robert De Niro has been a generous Democratic donor over the years, supporting Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Biden
KATY PERRY – $81,300
She didn't exactly kiss the girl but Katy was an active supporter Hillary Clinton. She made 22 donations worth a total of $81,340 towards the Democratic candidate's failed campaign in 2016.  
Perry has since endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election, sharing an Instagram post stating: 'Believed in you from the beginning'. 
But there is no public record of the pop star financially backing her candidate. 
Katy Perry was a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter and donor, making 22 donations worth a total of $81,340 to the Democratic candidate's failed campaign in 2016
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN – $30,000
A rocker who plays for the blues, Bruce Springsteen has made a total of 13 donations towards Democratic campaigns, just shy of $30,000. 
But it seems The Boss has not put any of his fortune – which Forbes estimates at $1.2billion although he says it's nowhere near that big – towards the party since 2020. 
FEC records show a bizarre $2.70 contribution to Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue in 2019.
President Joe Biden awards singer Bruce Springsteen a 2021 National Medal of Art in 2023
KANYE WEST – $19,700
The erratic rapper made a failed bid for president during the 2020 election, but has previously supported Democratic candidates. 
Records show Kanye made four modest donations totaling $19,700, including $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2015, and $2,000 to Obama. 
USHER – $14,700
The R&B singer endorsed at Harris at a recent Atlanta rally, but has been lowkey about his financial contributions to her campaign. 
He has five recorded donations to Democratic causes between 2015 and 2017, totaling $14,700. 
KARDASHIAN CLAN  – $7,700 
Kim Kardashian is friends with Ivanka Trump and posted this picture to wish the once – and maybe future – First Daughter Happy Birthday but her only donation has been to the Dems
While they may have their political leanings, the enterprising Kardashian clan are usually on the receiving end of any endeavor. 
However, Kim Kardashian has given once – $5k in 2014 to the Democratic National Committee - while her mom Kris Jenner gave $2,700 to Hillary in 2015. 
Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe all prefer to keep their Kash in the bank. 
BEYONCE AND JAY-Z – $2,700
Queen B recently sparked a frenzy after speaking at a Kamala Harris rally in her home state of Texas. 
Addressing the crowds, she said she was endorsing Harris 'not as a celebrity' but as 'a mother'.
She was previously reported to have allocated $4million for the Harris campaign, with plans to donate more 'if needed.' 
But FEC records only list a $2,700 gift from Beyoncé to the Hillary campaign. And there is no public record of her husband Jay-Z's donations. 
Beyonce sparked a frenzy after speaking at a Kamala Harris rally in her home state of Texas last week 
EMINEM – $250
Eminem was among the celebrity guests who endorsed Kamala Harris at her recent rally in Detroit. 
But unless he is making donations under one of his many pseudonyms, the rapper, real name Marshall Mathers, has only one political campaign donation in his name. 
The Democrat contributed $250 to the California Democrat Katie Hill's congressional campaign in 2019. 
Hill was elected but lasted only 11 months before being forced to resign when DailyMail.com revealed photos of the congresswoman posing naked while smoking a bong and making out with a young female aide.
TAYLOR SWIFT – $15
She's arguably the biggest pop star in the world, wielding tremendous influence over her millions of fans around the world. 
The singer previously supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election and last month announced her endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, triggering a wave of donations from fans and a spike in visitors to the national voter registration website. 
But FEC records only account for one $15 donation Swift made back in 2014, registered to her old address in Hendersonville, Tennessee. 
The pop superstar made the modest contribution towards 'Bonnie Watson Coleman for Congress' campaign in New Jersey. At least it was money well spent, Coleman won and has held her seat ever since.
The pop super star, pictured at the MTV VMAs in September, recently endorsed Kamala Harris
ANGELINA JOLIE
The Oscar-winning actress, 49, has polar opposite political views to her father Voight, but there is no public record of her financially supporting her party. 
TRAVIS KELCE 
The Kansas City Chiefs tight end does not appear to have given to a political cause apart from the bipartisan NFL Players Association.
BRAD PITT
The Hollywood actor in September revealed he was 'feeling hopeful' for Kamala Harris, but there is no public record of Pitt donating to the campaign. 
HARVEY WEINSTEIN – $580,000
The convicted rapist has given over half a million to the Democrats, according to records. 
Weinstein made 106 separate donations in total from 1995 to 2017 using the zip code of The Weinstein Company and Miramax Films in New York.
Now, of course, his zip code is 11370 – Rykers Island.
The convicted rapist has given over half a million to the Democrats, according to records. He was a known supporter of the Clintons over the years 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN – $181,000
The late pedophile and sex trafficker was a big Democrat supporter, donating 61 times before 2002 - around the same time he was hanging around New York with Trump.
BILL COSBY – $22,000
The disgraced comedian has made 15 contributions to Democratic campaigns, totaling $22,000. His most recent was $2,000 to Obama for America in 2012.
GHISLAINE MAXWELL – $2,300
Epstein's accomplice, currently serving time in a Florida federal  jail on a sex trafficking conviction, once gave $2,300 to Hillary's failed bid for president during the 2008 election.
SEAN COMBS - $6,000
Diddy, who is currently languishing in jail on sex assault and trafficking charges, has dished out $5,900 to the Democrats on three separate occasions.
His last recorded donation was in 2021, when he gave $2,100 to far-left former Ohio state senator Nina Turner in her failed bid for the United States House of Representatives.
