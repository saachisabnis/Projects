The Harris campaign’s cautionary tale of relying on the leftist celebrity enclave to move the needle.
When Kamala Harris confiscated Joe Biden’s slot at the top of the Democrat Party ticket, money started rolling in. After all, deep-pocketed Democrat donors were relieved that they didn’t have to fund yet another “Weekend at Bernie’s” presidential campaign.
Harris’s war chest totaled over $1 billion, but by the time election week rolled around, all of that money was gone and the campaign was reportedly $20 million in debt. This treatment of campaign cash should be considered a preview of what Harris would have done to the economy had she won.
A good chunk of the money was spent on get-out-the-vote concerts. While the exact figure hasn’t been publicized, the expense on celebrity concerts and endorsements was astronomical: $10 million was given to Beyoncé to simply appear at a rally and endorse Kamala; $5 million was paid to Megan Thee Stallion; $3 million was paid to Lizzo, who told voters that Kamala was going to make America like Detroit (🤨); $1.8 million went to Eminem; and $1 million went to Oprah Winfrey’s company, though she says, “I was paid nothing, ever.”
It moved the needle not a smidge.
Smoke and mirrors, glitterati endorsements, concerts, and vibes were all Kamala Harris could run on. Her campaign was abysmal — not only did she keep flip-flopping policy-wise, but she herself was not a likable figure. These concerts were a “let them eat cake” campaign strategy. Voters are struggling to buy groceries, but, by golly, they can see celebrities perform — or at least listen to them say a few words at a campaign rally.
The New York Times says, “The biggest names in entertainment said Vice President Kamala Harris should be elected to the nation’s highest office. In the end, it did not seem to matter much.” But the Times then goes on to suggest that celebrities like movie stars and musicians are at a disadvantage to online celebrities like Elon Musk and Joe Rogan.
While this may have a kernel of truth to it, it’s more than that. Celebrities like George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Lady Gaga have no idea what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck (and if they ever did, it was millions of dollars and many years ago). Neither do Joe Rogan or Elon Musk, for that matter, though they at least have a much better connection to and understanding of the blue-collar worker. Celebrities, by nature of being part of the glitterati, are not living relatable lives. The average American really doesn’t care what they think about politics. It’s nice if they agree with a personal conviction, but a disagreement isn’t going to change many people’s minds.
Americans are also tired of the superciliousness of our celebrities. As The Federalist’s Casey Chalk correctly points out, “They have shifted from simply voicing their political opinions to condescendingly lecturing the American public in every available fora.” Though this stance predates the 2024 election, the hysterics and conniptions were particularly vile after last Tuesday.
Rachel Zegler, star of Disney’s new live-action film “Snow White,” posted an Instagram rant in which she fulminated, “May trump supporters and trump voters and trump himself never know peace” (grammar in the original). In other words, she hopes more than half the country has something terrible that befalls it. This is one Disney princess whom my daughters will never be watching.
Actress Eva Longoria is splitting her time between Mexico and Spain. She told fashion magazine Marie Claire, “I’m privileged. I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.”
Perhaps these celebrities should take a long, hard look in the mirror before coming after the majority of Americans. It is they, the glitterati, who are acting like authoritarians, pitching full-on tantrums if an election doesn’t go their way.
In conclusion, celebrities are merely another part of the elitist leftist enclave. The Left doesn’t know, care about, or understand Middle America. All it seems to tell us is that we must think like the Left; otherwise, we’re “bitter clingers” or a “basket or deplorables” or even “garbage.” Until leftists stop trying to bully us and actually start listening to us, this cycle of elitist snobbery will continue to push them away from reality and the rest of the country.
