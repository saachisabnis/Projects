These days, it’s easy to list several respected, well-known female directors—consider Greta Gerwig, Olivia Wilde, and Ava DuVernay, to name a few. But it wasn’t so long ago that Hollywood was, by and large, a boys' club. While we’ve still got a long way to go—Chloé Zhao and Jane Campion's wins for Best Director in 2021 and 2022 made them the second and third women to receive the honor ever—we’ve certainly taken big steps toward more equitable film sets. Now, we’re looking back at some of those epic strides by paying homage to the best movies directed by women of all time.
A few will come as no surprise: We’d be remiss not to mention Yentl, for instance, for which Barbra Streisand became the first woman to win a directing Golden Globe in 1984. (Zhao became the second in 2021 for Nomadland.) Other titles, like the feminist horror movie Jennifer's Body, struck a chord deep within viewers, sparking joy, fear, sadness, rage, hope, or any combination of the above.
So pour yourself a glass of wine and settle in: These are the 41 best female-directed films.
If you’ve made it this far without watching A League of Their Own, here's some advice: Head to the couch immediately for a little history lesson in cinematic greatness. This Penny Marshall sports movie based on the 1943-founded American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) is a masterclass in storytelling. Told through the lens of feuding sisters and ballplayers Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty), who round out a team of tough, multifaceted women being coached by washed-up slugger Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), this semi-historical drama incorporates the real-life sports stories of several relevant historical female figures into its fibers. Dottie, for instance, is based on the late ballplayer Dottie Kamenshek—a first basewoman for the league’s Rockford Peaches. She was later named one of Sports Illustrated’s top female athletes of the century.WATCH IT
Julie Taymor made history in 1998 as the first woman to win a Tony award for Best Direction of a Musical (the stage version of The Lion King), but her direction of 2007’s Across the Universe is what we’re lasering in on. She brilliantly weaves the musical catalog of The Beatles into the story of two young souls (played by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess) struggling to navigate their relationship amid the political chaos of the ‘60s and the looming Vietnam War. Taymor’s film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture/Musical-Comedy. WATCH IT
American Psycho co-writer and director Mary Harron left a lasting mark on the horror genre with this 2000 classic, even though it didn't make a single top 10 list upon its release. Starring Christian Bale as a cold, calculating banker with a dark and sinister secret beneath his seemingly perfect all-American exterior, it has since attracted audiences far and wide for its satirical wit.

Considering the cultural impact of Judy Blume’s 1970 novel, Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret., had on the young women of its era (and every generation since), it’s only fitting that a woman known for her own coming-of-age magnum opus, The Edge of Seventeen's Kelly Fremon Craig, would direct its 2023 film adaptation. The filmmaker maintained much of Blume’s openness on puberty, sex, and religion, which is exactly what it took for the author to say yes to the project after refusing to release its rights for 50 years. “I just didn’t think it would ever be done in the way that I would have felt proud of it,” she said. Blume had so much confidence in Fremon Craig, however, she not only served as an executive producer, but she also made a small cameo alongside Rachel McAdams and Abby Ryder Fortson.

Barbie wasn’t just a record-breaking film by female directorial standards. It was a record-breaking film, period. Beating Harry Potter as the most successful Warner Bros. release in history, it was also the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the largest-ever global opening for a female-directed film, among other accolades. Its release sent director Greta Gerwig’s clout into the stratosphere, making her the first solo female director with a $1-billion film. Hitting all the right strides with the cast (Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera), the plot (Barbie loses her perfection overnight, causing her to seek out a cause to fix the problem in the “real world”), and the messaging, Barbie will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most successful films ever made, Oscar or no Oscar.

There are two types of films in this world: The ones you forget about almost as soon as you’ve finished watching them, and the ones you remember forever. The '80s classic Big falls into the latter camp. Starring the one and only Tom Hanks in his breakout role as a 12-year-old boy who is magically transformed into an adult overnight, this feel-good favorite is nostalgic, sweet, and funny—and it was directed by the late, great, Penny Marshall.

One of the most surprising films directed by a woman, Billy Madison is a pure, unadulterated slapstick comedy—and it put both star Adam Sandler and director Tamra Davis on the map. In it, the Sandman plays a 27-year-old manbaby who’s forced to go back to grade school as a condition to take over his father’s company. The partnership proved magic: The film not only opened at No. 1 at the box office, it became an immediate fan favorite. Though Davis had worked on other big films before, including critical darling Guncrazy, she called Billy Madison “the most relevant work of [her] career” in a 2015 op-ed for The Washington Post. As for Sandler, he said of his character: “Billy’s the closest I’ve come to playing myself.”

Bird Box had an absolute chokehold on anyone with a Netflix subscription in 2018. According to the company, the Sandra Bullock-led flick got 45 million views in its first week alone. Directed by Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier, this dystopian horror is about a malignant force that makes anyone who sees it feel suicidal. As a result, Bullock et. al are forced to wear blindfolds, never giving the viewer a look at the big bad. While some criticized this choice, Bier explained her decision to Variety in 2018. “I always felt the moment before you see the monster was super scary and suspenseful, and I wanted the whole movie to have that sense of suspense,” she said. She clearly did something right: To date, it’s still one of the network’s five most popular films ever.

Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy teamed up as co-directors for 2019’s acclaimed thriller, Blow the Man Down. The result? A truly unique piece of cinema that manages to stay with you long after the screen has faded on its main characters, Priscilla and Mary Beth Connolly (Sophie Lowe and Morgan Saylor)—two sisters who find themselves mixed up in a brutal crime after a night out goes awry.WATCH IT
Booksmart reintroduced actress Olivia Wilde to the world as a producer, and based on the film’s runaway success and the high praise she received from her cast, who raved about her ability to bring everybody together, she found her next calling. Following two teenage girls (Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever) over one wild, Superbad-style night after they realize that they’ve been too busy studying to have much fun in high school, Booksmart recalled the generational anthems of Wilde’s youth, such as The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. Though Wilde admitted that she felt hesitant to jump into the world of directing without a film degree, she called her 15 years on set her “de facto film school.” “I’d been spending that time shadowing great directors and also learning from bad directors,” she said, adding, “Bad professional experiences are just as valuable as cautionary tales.” We’ll say!

Kimberly Peirce’s 1999 release Boys Don’t Cry was revolutionary in its exploration of the real-life tragic chain of events that led to the rape and murder of trans man Brandon Teena in Lincoln, Nebraska. While its casting of Hilary Swank has drawn criticisms from the LGBTQ+ community, the film broke new ground at the time of its release, becoming the first mainstream LGBTQ+ movie to focus on a transgender man. WATCH IT
It’s hard to separate Buffy the Vampire Slayer from Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played the demon-fighting teen in the cult TV series from 1997 to 2003, but Kristy Swanson was the first actress to slay the role in the Fran Rubel Kuzui-directed film of the same name in 1992. Though series-creator Joss Whedon, who wrote the script for the movie, reportedly hated the more lighthearted comedic direction it took, eventually walking off set, the world got a memorable film, complete with appearances from Luke Perry and Ben Affleck, out of the deal. Rebel Kuzui, meanwhile, got to cut her teeth on a far larger project than her previous one, Tokyo Pop.

By now, there’s seemingly not a soul alive who hasn’t seen—and immediately fallen in love with—Amy Heckerling’s 1995 masterpiece, Clueless. Adapted from the classic Jane Austen novel Emma, this motion picture has it all: friendship, sex, love, and epic one-liners. (“You're a virgin, who can’t drive.”). Throw in some of the era’s biggest stars (we’re talking Alicia Silverstone, Paul Rudd, and Brittany Murphy!), a kickass soundtrack, and a wardrobe with the power to change the landscape of fashion, and you’ve got what may be the best teen movie of all time. Its only rival? Heckerling’s other generationally-defining work, Fast Times at Ridgemont High.WATCH IT
When a film is powerful enough to inspire Beyoncé, it’s time to sit up and take note. The singer’s 2016 visual album Lemonade was influenced by 1991’s Daughters of the Dust—the first film from a Black female director to achieve national theatrical distribution. Commanding and visually stunning, Daughters of the Dust is set at the turn of the 20th century and follows three generations of Gullah women as they prepare to migrate North from their long-time home on Saint Helena Island, where their ancestors were once enslaved. Lemonade allowed a new legion of fans to enjoy Julie Dash’s rich storytelling when it was subsequently re-released at the Toronto International Film Festival and in theaters nationwide. WATCH IT
Susan Seidelman, whose name you may recognize from a little show called Sex and the City, gave Madonna one of her first film breaks with this quirky 1985 comedy. Like any great ‘80s flick, the plot is as zany as they come, following the pop singer’s misadventures as the fictional Susan, who crosses paths with a less-than-savory group of characters after pocketing a pair of highly valued Egyptian earrings. Roberta (Patricia Arquette), meanwhile, is a New Jersey housewife who gets wrapped up in Susan’s antics. While you’ll have to pay close attention to keep up with all the twists and turns that befall the two women, the pure pandemonium that ensues along the way makes for a highly entertaining two hours. WATCH IT
Don’t Worry Darling may have gotten more buzz for the drama surrounding its cast members Florence Pugh, Chris Pine, Harry Styles, and Olivia Wilde (who pulled double duty as the film’s director), but when you take all the tension out of the equation, we think Wilde pulled off a pretty great film. A sci-fi thriller, it sees Jack (Styles) and Alice (Pugh) enjoying life in their sunny, 1950s-esque California town until Alice starts to see cracks in its facade. Even more alarming? Everyone, including her husband, is seemingly going to great lengths to keep them hidden. Wilde stars as Bunny, Alice’s fun-but-deceptive neighbor.

Few films have defined an entire generation like Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Depicting a group of high school students coming into their own (and raising plenty of hell along the way), this film’s influence was so huge it was added to the National Film Registry. While its monster cast undoubtedly played a large role in its success, director Amy Heckerling deserves her fair share of credit, too.WATCH IT
Director Kathryn Bigelow didn’t shy away from blood, guts, or gore in her 2009 Academy Award-winning war film, The Hurt Locker. Instead, she leaned into it, giving viewers a gripping look at life in combat. Told through the eyes of journalist Mark Boal, who was stationed with an American bomb squad in Iraq for two weeks in 2004, this action-packed flick earned Bigelow the title of the first female Best Director winner in Oscars history. In addition, the film cleaned up in other categories, taking home awards for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound Mixing.

Jennifer’s Body was a feminist horror masterpiece ahead of its time. Though it took fans a while to warm up to the genius produced by the screenwriter/director team of Diablo Cody (Juno) and Karyn Kusama (The Invitation, Destroyer), it has since become a cult classic. (Who wouldn't want to watch Megan Fox as a man-eating succubus with supernatural strength?) Following a vengeful demon who is brought forth when Jennifer is murdered in sacrifice by a Satanist band seeking their fortune and fame, it’s Fox’s favorite movie to date. Costar Amanda Seyfried has also called it “art.”

Ignore Barbie for a second—let’s talk about Gerwig's 2017 dramedy, Lady Bird. Somehow, someway, in her directorial debut, the filmmaker managed to capture all the mixed-up emotions that gawky, unsure teens feel and bottle them up in the form of heroine Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), better known as “Lady Bird.” From longing to fit in with the popular crowd to her first sexual encounters, every triumphant, cringe-worthy, poignant, and terrified moment you've experienced in your own adolescence seems to have found its way into this masterpiece.WATCH IT
Long before Gerwig was helming up the sixth—yes, sixth!—adaptation of the 1868 novel by Louisa May Alcott, director Gillian Armstrong introduced it to a whole new audience with her 1994 iteration. Impressive box office figures (it raked in $95 million) and a positive reception (its three Oscar noms were nothing to sneeze at) not only paved the way for the 2019 version's success but garnered an extremely devoted fan base. Through Armstrong's perceptive lens, the close-knit bond of the March sisters, as played by Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, and Trini Alvarado, jumped off the screen and into our hearts forever.

Considering that the Coppola family is filmmaking royalty, it’s not surprising that Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now), and the granddaughter of Carmine Coppola (The Godfather Part II score), would go on to become the first woman to be nominated for a writing, directing, and producing Oscar in the same year, and the first American woman to get a nod for best director for this 2003 comedy-drama. Her second film features acting legends Billy Murray and Scarlett Johansson as two lonely Americans who find solace in each other’s company while traveling overseas despite their obvious age gap.

Gina Prince-Bythewood was behind the cinematic glory that is the 2000s rom-com Love & Basketball. Setting out to make “a Black When Harry Met Sally,’” the director delivered the kind of fairytale she wanted to see reflected onscreen—a.k.a. one where the woman doesn’t have to choose between love and a career. The 2024 National Film Registry pick follows childhood friends and athletes Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) and Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) as they navigate professional hardships over the years and their complex feelings for each other.

Cited by legendary film critic Roger Ebert as one of the best films of the 2000s, Me and You and Everyone We Know is an indie love story that explores the developing relationship between a lonely shoe salesman (John Hawkes) and a quirky artist (Miranda July). Though it was the directorial debut for July, who also served as the film’s writer and director, it proved to be a force to be reckoned with, earning her plenty of accolades and the coveted Camerá d’Or award for Best First Feature Film at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.WATCH IT
Years before she was obliterating the box office with Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins was taking the world by storm with her directorial feature debut, Monster—a biographical drama about the real-life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Played by an unrecognizable Charlize Theron, Wuornos was sentenced to death for the seven murders she committed against her clients while working as a sex worker. Jenkins’ 2003 film documented her life and crimes, as well as the story of her relationship with her girlfriend/partner in crime (Christina Ricci).

History buffs will appreciate the thought-provoking period piece and book-to-movie adaptation of Mudbound. A tale of two World War II veterans who experience life post-combat through different lenses—one (Garrett Hedlund) as a white man and another (Jason Mitchell) as a Black man—it received several nods from both the Academy and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Director Dee Rees, who co-wrote the screenplay based on Hillary Jordan’s 2008 novel, was recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.WATCH IT
Chloé Zhao and her contemplative film Nomadland made history at the 2021 Oscars when she became the second woman ever (and the first woman of color) to win the award for Best Director. The film, nominated for six golden statues, also took home the Best Picture award, while lead Frances McDormand won Best Actress. If you’re still unfamiliar with the road movie, it takes a searing look at one woman’s journey through the American West, while living in her van. McDormand plays Fran, a gig worker who travels from the badlands to the desert in search of income–and freedom. Along the way, she meets others who share her desire for free living.

Forget The Catcher in the Rye. For young women growing up in the ‘90s, Now and Then was the only coming-of-age story that mattered. Homeland alum Lesli Linka Glatter brilliantly guided this all-star female cast, which included Demi Moore, Rosie O’Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson, Thora Birch, Gaby Hoffmann, Christina Ricci, and Ashleigh Aston Moore, as they navigated the highs and lows of friendship and adolescence, from first kisses and divorce to bodily changes and séances—and we relished every second of it.WATCH IT
Without Nancy Meyers’ 1998 remake of The Parent Trap, which launched Lindsay Lohan into stardom, we might never have had Freaky Friday—or Mean Girls, for that matter. Together, Meyers and Lohan, who called her dual role as twins Annie and Hallie Parker role a “life-changing experience,” fooled even then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner into thinking the actress had a real-life sibling. (He reportedly once asked her where her twin was.)
WATCH IT
Celine Song wrote and directed this total tearjerker about two childhood best friends (played by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo) who drifted apart but reconnected at different points—including an in-person reunion decades later. The tender film is semi-autobiographical and will move you in ways you may not imagine; it may seem like a story of love lost, but it's instead an examination of the choices we make, mourning our past selves, and embracing the present. Don't say we didn't warn you when Song's screenplay and deft direction linger and leave you tearing up long past the runtime.

Mary Lambert really knocked it out of the park with her '80s horror movie adaptation of Stephen King’s Pet Sematary: Her creepy retelling of the Creed family, who discover an ancient cemetery burial ground with the power to bring the dead back to life, also left a lasting impression on horror fans, who often count it among King’s scariest movies. (And considering there are more than 50 to choose from, that’s saying a lot.)

Released one year after Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic, Sofia Coppola's 2023 film Priscilla tells the story of The King through a more feminist set of eyes: his ex-wife’s. Focusing on the couple’s home life and relationship, the film is based on Priscilla’s 1985 memoir, Elvis and Me. She also served as the movie’s executive producer. Between its unique perspective, excellent costuming (Cailee Spaeny’s hair alone should win an award), and Coppola’s minimalistic touches, the project was a hit.

Everyone (and we do mean everyone) was talking about Emerald Fennell's Saltburn when it was released in 2023, but 2020's feminist drama Promising Young Woman put her on the map. Tackling rape culture in a post #MeToo era, Fennell’s revenge-seeking lead, Cassie Thomas (played by Carey Mulligan), made quite the splash with her turn as a scorned woman methodically tracking down complicit parties in the sexual assault of her best friend who died by suicide. The film was one of three female-led pieces nominated for a Best Director Golden Globe in 2021.WATCH IT
Penny Marshall gifted us with one last film before she switched focus to television production and later passed away in 2018: 2001’s Riding in Cars With Boys. Starring Drew Barrymore as an overbearing mother who is reflecting on her own life for a novel, it begins with the character’s teenage pregnancy and follows her subsequent years as a single parent. Though the movie didn’t stand a chance in the theaters thanks to its post-9/11 release date, Barrymore got high praise for the part. She also practiced emotional adaptability throughout the film, telling SFGate that her character gave her empathy for her own young mother, Jaid. "I started to be in my mom's shoes through Bev,” she said. “It was the most intense awakening."

Ava DuVernay’s triumph of a film, Selma, is a hugely important piece of cinematography. Not only does it tell the real-life story of the history-making voting rights marches that occurred in 1965 as led by Martin Luther King Jr., but DuVernay also made history herself with this movie’s 2014 release when she became the first Black woman ever nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Director. Told with plenty of emotion and heart by its cast, which includes David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey, Tessa Thompson, Angela Bassett, and Cuba Gooding Jr., this film reflects our nation’s collective heritage.

There are rom-coms…and then there’s Sleepless in Seattle, which quickly became the gold standard for romance upon its release in 1993. Late journalist, author, and famed screenwriter Nora Ephron (also behind the legendary When Harry Met Sally..., among other classics) co-wrote and directed this tale of a woman (Meg Ryan) who falls in love with a single dad (Tom Hanks) after hearing him talk about his late wife on a radio show. The only problem? She’s engaged. Oh, and lives on the other side of the country. WATCH IT
Arguably one of the most successful female filmmakers to date, Nancy Meyers certainly knows her way around blockbuster rom-coms. (Think What Women Want, It’s Complicated, and The Holiday, to name a few.) It’s her poignant love-triangle movie about a thriving playwright (Diane Keaton) in her mid-50s and a 60-something entrepreneur (Jack Nicholson) with a penchant for much younger women—including Keaton’s daughter (Amanda Peet)—however, that really got us in the feels. Written, directed, and co-produced by Meyers, Something’s Gotta Give tackles the complex, ever-evolving relationship between men and women with beauty, grace, and a little humor. The result? Oscars nominations for both Keaton and Nicholson, plus a Golden Globe win for Keaton for Actress in a Musical or Comedy.WATCH IT
If there were any lingering doubts in 1992 that a female director could be laugh-out-loud funny, Penelope Spheeris put them to bed for good with a little help from Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in Wayne’s World. Based on the duo’s popular Saturday Night Live skit, the film was an overnight success, raking in a cool $183 million at the box office. It was a figure that stunned even Spheeris. “We had no idea when we made the movie that it would even be around for a week,” she later told The Hollywood Reporter. But the tale of two rock ‘n’ roll nerds who host a public access show from their parents’ basement and their adventures attempting to secure a record contract for Wayne’s girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere) turned out to be what Spheeris called “a magical combination of cast and crew and a magical moment” that would be beloved by filmgoers for generations to come.

There’s not a whole lot Drew Barrymore can’t do. She acts, hosts, and in 2009, she showed the world she could direct, too, with the coming-of-age flick Whip It. Starring Elliot Page as a small-town teen who finds meaning and confidence in a local roller derby group full of older women, the film was well-received by critics and audiences alike, who praised it for its feminist vibes. Said Barrymore: "Women need to find a support system out there—a group of friends who keep you very real and inspire you to do better and laugh with you along the way."

A then-20-year-old Jennifer Lawrence wasn’t the only woman shining with Winter’s Bone—director Debra Granik took home plenty of accolades for her adaptation of the Daniel Woodrell novel of the same name, including a Sundance Film Festival Best Directing Award. Raw and harrowing, this dark drama centers on a teenage girl who must find her missing father to avoid losing her home, which has been put up as a bond following his drug arrest. It’s gritty, intense, and emotional, and will have you on the edge of your seat until the last credits roll.WATCH IT
For Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins, it was less about breaking glass ceilings and more about smashing them. Her 2017 flick, which follows warrior Diana Prince into an epic battle against evil, broke records worldwide, becoming the first female-led superhero movie in a decade. It was also the second-ever movie to be led by a woman with a budget of more than $100 million. More than just impressive stats, however, this pick has heart. Star Gal Gadot told Entertainment Weekly in July 2016, “When Patty and I had our creative conversations about the character, we realized that Diana can still be a normal woman...She can be sensitive. She is smart and independent and emotional. She can be confused. She can lose her confidence. She can have confidence. She is everything."

As a co-writer, producer, actress, director, and singing talent for the 1983 film Yentl, Barbra Streisand had a hand in nearly every facet of this award-winning project. She used the film to break down gender norms in every sense of the word as Yentl Mendel, an Ashkenazi Jewish woman living in Poland and posing as a man to receive the teachings of the Talmud. And, because life wouldn’t be as fun without a little complexity, Yentl finds herself enamored with a male student named Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), while Avigdor’s fianceé (Amy Irving) falls in love with Yentl. Ay yi yi! For her efforts, Streisand became the first woman to ever receive a Golden Globe for directing.WATCH IT
