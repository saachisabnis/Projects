Beyoncé will perform live at halftime of Wednesday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans, which will give fans some added entertainment during the NFL's first games on Netflix.
The 43-year-old star singer is no stranger to the NFL, having performed during the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 and Super Bowl 50 in 2016.
