Tatcha is a Taiwanese-American-owned biz founded by Vicky Tsai that specializes in Japanese beauty rituals.
Promising review: "My go to sunscreen! I’ve tried many sunscreens in an effort to wear sunscreen everyday. With oily skin already, most leave me feeling greasy, but Tacha is incredible. It goes on matte, leaving your skin with a really nice finish. It’s light as a feather, and I recommend it to all of my friends. Sunscreen is no joke — you need to it protect your skin, and it’s worth it to spend money on a product that you will keep coming back to. 5/5 stars!" —Jon
Get it from Amazon for $70.
One/Size is a queer- and Filipino-owned business founded by makeup expert Patrick Starr to ensure that makeup is really one size fits all, as it should be. 
OMGGGG, let me collect my thoughts, I am shooketh. I *finally* got my hands on this about a month ago (it's always sold out!) and all I can say it is sorcery. Patrick Starr is a witch, there's no convincing me otherwise. I did my makeup one morning, set my face with this, and had a full on day — ran errands, went to Trader Joe's, went to a bar, then a restaurant, sweat, and I kid you not, every time I looked in the mirror my face was M👏 A👏 T👏 T👏 E. When I got home that night, my face had not moved at all and there was literally no oil to be found on my face. I have expensive setting sprays I love but by the end of the night, I usually have a bit of shine on my face, which seems like no big deal but as an oily girly, I hate that, I look greasy. But this stuff is a magical holy grail, no shine formed against me shall prosper. I see why Beyoncé uses this. I kept hearing the hype around this but it is a bit pricey so I kept putting off buying it. This is worth every bit of hype and every single penny. And I'm frugal! I will find a nice, affordable alternative and run with it forever because some big name-brand products do not work for me and I hate spending a lot of $$ for 💩  results. If I recommend any name-brand product, it'd be this. I love this stuff and I will forever eat that price and buy this now. Big fan.

Axis-Y is a Korean skincare biz founded by Maggie Yue.
Promising review: "I swear by this serum, it made my dark spots disappear. and I’ve been using this on and off for about four months…because I’m not consistent with my skincare lol. These photos are only about a month apart...the dark spot on my cheek completely disappeared. I don’t have photos from when I first began using it but there’s a huge improvement!" —Minah

Promising review: "TikTok has influenced me to purchase a lot and this has to be one of my absolute favorites!! It’s a beautiful, glossy glow and not greasy at all! I like using a Beauty Blender to apply it to the face and a brush for the body. If this is in your cart, do yourself a favor and buy it now!!" —GalacticSam

It's from a Korean-owned biz!
Promising review: "I HAD to write a review. I use this in the morning and night after my whole face routine and putting on moisturizer. I don't have dark bags however, my under-eyes do get a bit puffy and I was noticing fine lines. DUDE, those fine lines are fading. Last night I went to a party and woke up looking like the crypt keeper, and this stuff normalized my creepy zombie eyes in about 20 minutes. It's $9. Do yourself a favor and buy it." —Jasmine Deatherage
Get it from Amazon for $9.90+ (available in two styles and in multipacks).
Oh! Anddd reviewers say they use this as a step in their double cleansing routine. What the heck is that, you may ask? Well, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice — first with an oil-based cleanser, and then again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the gross stuff out of your pores.
Anua is a Korean skincare brand.
Promising reviews: "This is my first time ordering an oil-based cleanser and I’m so glad I purchased this one. I originally saw this product on TikTok and wanted to see what the hype was all about. After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2–3 minutes, I could visibly see my white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin, however, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom and my scarring doesn’t look as deep! The cleanser has a light clean scent. Not super strong! I am currently pairing this cleanser with the Anua heartleaf soothing toner to achieve glass skin. #glassskinera" —Myshel Cagle
"I can't live without this cleansing oil, it's magic in a bottle. This is the only thing that's been able to clear the sebaceous filaments on my nose after consistent use daily!! It also helps the milia/filaments under my eyes too! LOVE ITTTTT, WHO LET ME LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT DOUBLE CLEANSING AT NIGHT?" —Sarah Coleman
Get it from Amazon for $17.69 (available in two styles).
Beauty of Joseon is a Korean skincare brand founded by Sumin Lee.
Promising review: "This is so soothing and helpful for my face. I had so much hormonal acne on my face, but after using this, it really cleared up! I rarely get breakouts anymore at all and I attribute it to this serum. There is no scent and the texture is exactly what I’d like out of a serum — slightly thick but still easy to spread on the face and neck." —A J
Get it from Amazon for $16.14+ (available in four other formulas and a multipack).
Kaja is a Korean beauty brand!
Promising review: "Love this product. Gives the perfect sunburned look for spring and summer. Pigmented and buildable, goes on creamy, and leaves a dewy finish." —jstro81

This toner is vegan and cruelty-free and it's from a Korean skincare brand!
Promising review: "I am in love with this rice toner. It might be one of the best toners I've ever tried. I feel like it made my pimples disappear and made my acne scars lighten. This might be one of the best Korean products I've ever tried as well. It doesn't have a weird scent and it looks a little bit like milk. I feel so refreshed after I use this toner and it makes my skin so shiny and plump. I feel very moisturized after using it. Anyone thinking of using a toner should try this one." —Kayra
Get it from Amazon for $23.20+ (available in two sizes).

Corsx is also a Korean skincare brand.
Alright friends, I am here to confirm that the hype surrounding this stuff is SO real. I've had acne since I was literally 8 years old (don't ask, my cousin was a face painter and practiced on me so I broke out BAD) and I'm JUST now starting to get it together. My skin this past year has completely changed, I have gotten super serious about my skincare routine, and I am now ✨ pimple-free ✨ . Now, I am grateful that my skin has cleared up, but it was still kinda dull, uneven, ya know, the little nitpicky stuff. That is until I cracked and bought this little potion. My skin is now ra-di-anttttt! It's never looked better. My only regret is not taking before and after pics but glass skin, I know her. I haven't gone out in public without makeup since I was like 12 because I was so insecure about my skin. Now, chiiiilld, I go out all the time free of makeup. I also bought this for my cousin for Christmas, she's obsessed, a friend slept over and I let them use this, they're now obsessed, I guarantee you'll fall in love after your first use. 
Promising review: "This is a great product. It’s not sticky and has no smell. It's my favorite product to use with any other skincare product. Very gentle and helps with acne. Will be a regular in my skincare routine." —C
Get it from Amazon for $15.99.
To use as intended, apply the moisturizer after the snail repairing essence has dried on your face in your skincare routine.
Check out a TikTok of the snail mucin moisturizer in action. 
Promising review: "If you're like me and have oily/combo skin that is also sensitive and prone to acne, this is an excellent product worth its price. Very little goes a long way since the slimy texture glides right over the skin. It does not leave any sticky residue, on the contrary, it is absorbed into the skin very quickly. It also keeps the skin moisturized but does not trap oil, in fact, I find my skin to be less oily after a few days of using it!" —Madeline
Get it from Amazon for $15.99.
They're also from a Korean-owned beauty brand!
Promising review: "Worth it!  I used my first mask from a sample and immediately purchased a box of 10. Very hydrating and nourishes the skin.  I was surprised that this mask has given me better skin than after some facials.  Does not 'pill' for those of you who want to use it before a special night, but I would recommend to let it settle in for a couple of hours to absorb all the goodness before putting makeup on.  My skin can be temperamental to new products and prone to redness and breakouts and I can honestly say that my skin loves this and has not been happier.  I use once a week with the daily skin essence." —Summers76

Aavrani is an Indian-owned brand founded by Rooshy Roy!
Promising review: "After the first use I could see a difference, my hair was softer, smooth, and had little frizz.  The price is excellent for the amount of product you get.  I plan on using this two times a week.  I will definitely buy it again!!" —Wendywo
Get it from Sephora for $39.
Elizavecca is a Korean beauty brand!
Promising review: "I've been buying this mask for a little over a year now and can verify that it is totally worth the hype. I have relatively dry skin, but while I never had acne when I was younger, I quit hormonal birth control a few years ago and since then have started breaking out shortly after ovulation. I tried many more expensive masks, but I also have very sensitive skin, and previous products either left me itchy and irritated or had no effect. This mask has completely cured all of my skin problems. If I remember to put it on the night I think I've ovulated, I have zero zits, and if I forget and some start to show up, I do the mask and the zits have significantly retreated by the next morning. I only need to use it a few times a month so it takes me several months to go through a jar. I would pay four times more for this product if I had to!" —carof

You'll also get a velour puff!
Promising review: "My skin is on the oilier side and this product saved my life, especially on camera. It is flawless, reduces shine, and doesn't make you look splotchy. It goes on flawlessly on top of my other products and feels so light. 100000/10. I've used so many powders and this product makes your skin look airbrushed in real life." —Marissa Pizzuto
Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in eight shades).
Kulfi Beauty, named after a type of South Asian ice cream, is a South Asian-owned small biz that makes products that celebrate and empower the diverse needs of their communities.
Promising review: "These are just what I have searched a decade for. I've never had an eyeliner go on so smooth or effortlessly before. The color stays vibrant all day, not sinking into my skin or transferring elsewhere. I am in love with this product." —Andrea J
Get a set of five from Kulfi Beauty for $85.
Elizabeth Mott is a Korean American woman-owned biz!
Promising review: "So let me start by saying, I have used nearly every eyeshadow primer available. From high-end to low — Mac, Lorac, Urban Decay...they don't hold a candle to Thank Me Later. I have very oily skin. I use this primer, and my shadow lasts a full eight hours or more. I could get maybe five or six out of the other brands, if I'm lucky. I got this as a sample in my Ipsy bag, and I had to buy the full-size product straight away! I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you, Elizabeth Mott, for finally making a primer that lasts! I love this stuff!" —Melissa Mae
Get it from Amazon for $13.99.
Promising review: "I wore this primer under my foundation (Nars and Maybelline Fit Me) along with setting spray (Nyx) in this photo [above right]. I had been dunked in the pool two times and went down a giant slide that caused you to go under water three times. This was the result of my makeup! Love this product. A little goes a long way!" —Ryan Brooks
Get it from Amazon for $17.65 (available in four styles).
It's from a Korean-owned brand!
Promising reviews: "Just *chefs kiss*. I have textured/damaged skin due to acne and this product worked instantly for me. This left my face feeling sooo soft and smooth, I have never experienced this type of results from any product that I’ve used. I highly recommend this!!!" —Carla
"Wait so three things. One, I never write reviews on Amazon. Two, I didn't realize how much I needed this until I gave it a try. Three, just use this for a week and you'll find yourself skipping visits to both your dermatologist and the spa. There's something magical in this bottle — I'm convinced there's a genie in this bottle." —Amazon Customer
Get it from Amazon for $19.42+ (available in two sizes).
Promising review: "I’m a bit of a long time skincare collector, so I’m a tough critic. I am 46-years-old with sensitive skin which can be prone to acne and redness. This product is magic and is quickly becoming my holy grail. It provides intense soothing and moisturizing with a beautiful dewy look. I cannot say enough about this. My only gripe is I wish it came in a pump as not to have to scoop the cream out." —momoutwest 🌲 
Get it from Amazon for $23+ (available in two sizes).
Okay, soooo I finally got my hands on this and can not stop wearing it!! The shade it turns on my skin is just GORG. It's like watching a magic trick happen on your face because it changes right on your skin! It makes me look so fresh-faced. Obsessed is an understatement. Oh! Andddd it kinda doubles as a highlight, like, I get the most stunning glow. I love, I love, I love, can't get enough of this stuff. And again, the color that shows up for me (above) is *not* the same as the color that'll show up on yours!
Youthforia is an Asian woman-owned small business established in 2020 that specializes in environmentally friendly, cruelty-free makeup.
Check out a TikTok of the BYO Blush in action. 
Promising review: "I'm done, no more experimenting with other blushes, this is my forever blush. BYO is such a unique product on the market — it's plant-based, provides a natural/beautiful bespoke flush, and can be used on the lips as well. Its color-changing formula is a game-changer as it magically picks the most complementary shade/hue for the user. Furthermore, I don't feel like I'm wearing makeup, and the oil formula is nourishing for my skin! I loved it so much I bought all my friends a BYO Blush!" —JZ
Get it from Youthforia for $36 or Amazon for $32.99.
Krave Beauty is a Korean woman-owned small biz that aims to make skincare easy and stress-free.
Promising review: "I struggled with oily, acne-prone skin and a damaged barrier since I was a teenager. But I've been loyal to this cleanser and the oat moisturizer since they came out and y'all...it took some time, but my skin is finally, FINALLY, in the place I always wanted it to be. It has the perfect texture, amount of lather, and after-feel of any cleanser I've ever tried. Do your skin a favor and try this." —Monisa A.
Get it from Krave Beauty for $16 or Amazon for $18.
This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. It also comes from a Korean-owned brand!
Promising review: "This is the first lip oil I've ever used. Usually I avoid anything with oil because I have very sensitive and generally oilier skin, but I wanted to give this a try because I wanted something sheer and pretty for a natural makeup look. Probably the best purchase I've ever made!!! It's super sheer and looks fine on its own without any other makeup. The smell is delicious, and while the gloss dries and fades after about an hour or two without eating, the color stays all day! I did have to reapply after eating, but not after drinking water! I just wish it was bigger, it's a teeny bottle. Would definitely buy again!!" —Rachel
Get it from Amazon for $12 (available in 14 shades and in multipacks).
Promising reviews: "Not gonna lie I was skeptical that this could help me. A few months ago I decided I could bleach my hair. I burnt it to such a crisp that I’ve literally been wearing it up under a cap. That worked when it was winter but now it’s warm so I needed a solution. I saw this product highly recommended on other sites and the reviews were good. So I ordered a tube. Used it twice now and OH. MY. LANTA. For months my hair has felt like crunchy noodles ready to snap at a moment's notice. After one treatment (left in about 15 minutes after shampoo, before conditioner) my ends feel soft!! After the second time washing with it, it actually moves like it’s not damaged and it is visibly SO much healthier. Like seriously idk how they bottled witchcraft but I’m going to continue to use this product even when my hair grows out. An absolute magical miracle potion! I seriously prepared myself to explain to the world that it doesn’t work. But instead, I have the healthiest hair I’ve had since being a home hairdresser. 10/10 for less then $10. Picture from left to right (blonde above): my hair before using this, my hair after first treatment, my hair after second treatment." —Beth

Promising review: "I’ve been using this for 19 days now, twice daily. I really love that my skin isn’t dry or tight after cleansing and it doesn’t burn any open acne sores either! I do believe it has helped balance my skin as I have had constant acne for eight years now! My breakouts have lessened and the ones I had when I started using this have been slowly healing and fading. I’ve been using this along with the Some By Mi toner and that has really made the difference! I wish I would’ve known about Korean skincare products earlier! Highly recommend this for any acne sufferers!" —TootTootMcBumberSnazzle
Get it from Amazon for $13.99.
Psttt! It's from a Korean-owned brand!
Promising review: "Freakin' love this stuff. Makes my skin feel bouncy and hydrated. It feels like a beautiful drink of sunny morning water for the face. LOVE the smell of this stuff it’s a very bright citrusy scent I can’t describe fully that just smells like you are happy to be alive lol. Oh AND I looked up the ingredients of this stuff on the EWG website and it had pretty good safety ratings! After using this consecutively for a couple of weeks I’ve noticed a significant brightening affect and anti acne affect! I think this is due to the active ingredients being for skin barrier health so the skin is less likely to break out. And the evening of my skin tone is just an added benefit!" —CatLover222
Get it from Amazon for $21.99.
Peach & Lily is a woman- and Asian-owned biz that specializes in cruelty-free, spa-quality K-beauty skincare.
Promising review: "Love this moisturizer so much! It’s definitely a holy grail in my routine now. It’s so cooling and refreshing and leaves my skin feeling so hydrated, soft and smooth without any greasy or heavy feeling or sticky residue. Great for the oily skin and acne-prone folks!" —Chloe W.

Phytosurgence is a queer- and Asian-owned, Canada-based small biz. 
HuffPost Shopping writer Haley Zovickian says: "I stumbled upon Phytosurgence one day and I have never looked back. All of their products are meticulously formulated with natural ingredients and rich, unique shades that you won't be able to find anywhere else — trust me, I've looked lol. My sensitive skin loves these blushes and the blush geek in me (or fully embodying me) is SCREAMING. My personal favorite is Condensate, a cool-toned muted dusty rose, but Evaporate, a neutral smoky peach, is a crowd favorite of the bunch. Plus, they're so affordable for such high-quality. A million chef's kisses."

After mixing the powder and activator, just apply the mask on your face, and you'll start to feel it working instantly!
And they're from a Korean-owned beauty brand!
Promising review: "After years of trying different products on my sensitive, acne-prone, red, rough skin, I saw this mask and all of the positive reviews and thought 'what the hell, I'll give it a go.' Even after the first application, I was really impressed with the results. My rough skin is smoother, I have no additional breakouts and when I do wear makeup it actually blends into my skin. It also helps the deep wrinkles on my neck. I even got a compliment on my skin the other day — this NEVER happens. I use the mask twice per week. I'm on month two and I recommend it to anyone with problems with their skin. My only caution is that it smells kind of funky (who cares) and it's a little hard to remove. I only apply the mask when I'm going to shower and wash my hair. It's zombie life for me here on out!" —Charlie B

Check out the balm in action here.
Plus, they're from a Korean-owned beauty brand!
Promising review: "I recommend this for dry skin rather than oily skin. When I applied it, it felt similar to applying Vaseline. However, it’s not greasy or sticky. I have dry skin and my skin absorbs the multi balm quickly. It spreads well and the area where it was applied became soft. I recommend applying it to the U-zone rather than the T-zone of the face. I mainly apply around the eyes, mouth (nasolabial folds), and neck wrinkles! In particular, immediately upon application, it had the effect of slightly tightening the skin, adding radiance, and reducing wrinkles (especially around the mouth). I think it definitely helps moisturize when I apply it after skincare, before makeup, and before going to bed." —Ah Kim
Get it from Amazon for $21.86+ (available in six styles).
I Dew care is a Korean-owned biz.
Promising reviews: "I almost want to gatekeep. By far THE best dry shampoo I’ve ever used — not sure how this sorcery works, but I’m obsessed!" —Robertson
"I originally bought this for a month-long trip to Australia (that began with five days of camping without much time to stop by a store). I wanted something small and non-aerosol (because, travel), and hate applying powder by hand and didn't want to bring an application brush. The application sponge is great, and the powder itself is also magic. I was a DAILY hair washer most of my teenage and adult life, but now I can go an entire WEEK with this stuff (and other mindful habits like night braids). I really love it."—Bre

Promising review: "I can't live without it!! This product has become a need for my skin. I have truly seen the difference. When I break out I would usually get scars for several days, but this product makes them disappear extremely fast. I truly do recommend it because you can see the difference as soon as you start using it!" —Lulurosado
