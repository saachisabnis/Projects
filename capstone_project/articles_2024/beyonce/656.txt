Chicago Sky rookie superstar Angel Reese posted her 12th consecutive double-double (27 points, 10 rebounds) on Friday in an 88-84 road win over the Seattle Storm, tying WNBA legend Candace Parker for the most all-time over multiple seasons.
Reese had 16 points and six rebounds in the first half alone to help the Sky stay close against the Storm, who took a 42-40 lead into the break. She hit her first career three-pointer along the way.
Reese had to take a seat three minutes into the third quarter, however, after picking up three quick fouls to give her four for the game.
The Sky caught fire in the third, scoring 30 points. Chennedy Carter scored 11 of them, including this three-point play to put Chicago up 70-62 with 55 seconds left in the third.
Reese came back in the fourth and helped keep the Storm at bay, hitting a huge three for a 78-70 lead midway through the quarter.
The Storm fought back, though, cutting the lead to two on two occasions in the final 20 seconds. Seattle fouled Reese each time in response, but the ex-LSU star hit all four of her free throw attempts to guide Chicago to victory.
It was an incredible win for the Sky against a Storm team that entered the evening 8-1 at home and 13-6 overall. Carter had a fantastic night as well with 33 points and three steals to pace the Sky.
During and after the game, fans praised Reese's continued excellence as she tied an all-time WNBA record just 19 games into her pro career.
The Sky will stay in Seattle for a rematch with the Storm on Saturday at 6 p.m. ET.
