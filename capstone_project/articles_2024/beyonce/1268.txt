Kimberly Redmond//March 8, 2024//  
Following the launch of a new haircare line Cécred, Beyoncé and her charity foundation, BeyGOOD, are giving $500,000 in grants to cosmetology schools and salon owners across the U.S. — including ones in New Jersey.
Jana’s Cosmetology Academy will receive $50,000 to provide five students with $10,0000 scholarships. Located in Clementon, it is the state’s first Black-owned and operated beauty school.
As part of the new initiative, the organization will also offer 25 $10,000 business grants to salons in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and New Jersey. The markets were selected because of their “large, diverse community of hair stylists.” 



“Hairstylists have an immense impact on the people in their chairs,” BeyGOOD said in a statement. “They create a sacred space where we can show up how we want and express ourselves through our hair. We’re honored to give back to this amazing community.”
“Fostering talent, promoting professionalism, and supporting entrepreneurship within the hair industry is deeply important to us,” the nonprofit went on to say. “That’s why we’re partnering with Cécred to create the Cécred x BeyGOOD Fund, which celebrates the influence professional stylists have on hair health and the critical importance of advocating for the salon community.”
Rooted in legacy
The Grammy-winning singer’s nonprofit praised Atiya Johnson, Jana’s CEO, for her commitment to diverse education as well as her focus on shaping “the lives of her students to be successful.” 



In response to the news, Johnson said she was overjoyed.

Johnson unexpectedly got involved in the industry in 2004 when she took other her mother’s salon at the age of 17.
“Local hair salons like our establishment have been rooted in legacy,” Johnson said. “Our doors have been open to the community for years and have changed lives. Our goal is to lift the next generation of inspiring cosmetology students.”
She also thanked Cécred, Beyoncé and BeyGOOD for selecting Jana’s to be part of “such a life-changing monumental opportunity for our students and future ELITE beauty professionals to dominate the industry through the @begood x @cecred!”
Since opening in 2021, Jana’s has graduated about 120 students – most of them Black or from other diverse background. Its programs include braiding, natural haircare and barbering.
Applications for scholarships will be accepted through March 20. Additional details about the salon business grant program is available here.
