JAY-Z is no stranger to being accused of having illuminati affiliations and dealings with other mysterious figures, but this one may take the cake.
On Thursday, Feb. 8, British rapper and former Roc Nation-managed artist M.I.A. took to X to unload a vicious ALL CAPS barrage of since deleted (and at times incoherent) tweets accusing the “Family Feud” rapper of abandoning her as she fought for custody of her child and stealing her style to use for other Roc Nation artists.
“THE DAY I WAS SERVED, 4 MY CHILD, [ROC] NATION STOPPED ALL COMMUNICATION WITH ME AND ALL MY EMAILS TO JAYZ ASKING FOR HELP WAS WIPED FROM MY INBOX. MY WAS BROKEN INTO AND EVERY LAP WAS TAKEN. I WAS TRAPPED IN BROOKLYN ON ORDER SERVED THAT [RESTRICTED] ME LEAVING BKLYN FOR 15 YEARS,” she began.
“I SACRIFICED MY CAREER FOR MY CHILD. THEY RIPPED ME OFF AND COPIED MY STYLE AND GAVE IT TO THEIR PUPPETS AND SHADOW BANNED ME ON EVERY PLATFORM,” she continued seeming to make a dig at Rihanna and others who followed her on the label. “BUT IT WAS WORTH IT TO SAVE HIM FROM THE MADNESS OF WHAT YOU KNOW NOW.”
The “Paper Planes” rapper made a handful of even more outlandish claims including that JAY-Z was paid off by the sex cult, NXIVM, to hurt her career and custody chances, and that both Beyoncé and Solange are friends with her son’s unscrupulous caretaker whom she accuses of vaccinating her son without her permission.
Since 2012 M.I.A. has been in an ongoing custody battle with her ex-fiancé Benjamin Bronfman. Bronfman’s grandfather was once affiliated with NXIVM before severing all ties once it was clear the group was a cult. It is M.I.A.’s belief that Bronfman’s family paid JAY-Z to sabotage her career beginning with her 2013 album, Matangi, which failed to make a commercial impact despite positive critical reception.
M.I.A.’s last studio album to date was 2022’s Mata, which failed to dent the Billboard 200 chart.
