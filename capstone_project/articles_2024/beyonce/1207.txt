ESPN has released its College Football Playoff (CFP) National Championship promotional creative featuring world renowned superstar Beyoncés newly-released track, MY HOUSE. The spots debut today and runs up until the CFP National Championship Presented by AT&T between No. 1 Michigan and No. 2 Washington.
Its only fitting to have the chart-topping Houston native covering this years creative, as the grand finale of ESPNs industry-leading college football productions takes place in Houston, Texas. The pinnacle of the college football campaign concludes in Houstons NRG Stadium, home of the Houston Texans.
ESPN will have wall-to-wall on-site studio programming Monday, Jan. 8 across ESPN platforms, with ESPNs signature MegaCast coverage kicking off at 7:30 p.m. ET. Full details regarding ESPNs studio and MegaCast plans will be announced in the coming days.
