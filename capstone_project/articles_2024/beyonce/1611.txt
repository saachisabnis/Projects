Renowned bounce music artist Big Freedia and global superstar Beyoncé are facing a copyright infringement lawsuit filed in Louisiana earlier this week. The local music group Da Showstoppaz claim that Big Freedia illegally used elements from their 2002 song “Release a Wiggle” in her 2014 track “Explode,” which was later sampled by Beyoncé in her 2022 hit “Break My Soul.” The song became a major success, earning four Grammy nominations and winning the award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording in 2023.
According to the lawsuit, Da Showstoppaz are claiming a copyright interest in the original musical composition and recording of “Release a Wiggle.” They assert that their work was used without authorization, leading to significant commercial gain for both Big Freedia and Beyoncé.
The suit alleges that Big Freedia used key elements from “Release a Wiggle” that included the melody, phrases and music without permission or credit. They argue that these elements were then used in Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul,” further amplifying the infringement. The group is demanding full disclosure of the profits made from the alleged infringement, cessation of further use, as well as proper credit and compensation .
Big Freedia, known for bringing bounce music into the national spotlight, has not yet responded to the lawsuit. Her track “Explode” was a pivotal song in her career, and its subsequent sampling by Beyoncé brought further attention to her work.
This lawsuit highlights the ongoing issues surrounding copyright and intellectual property rights in the music industry. Sampling and the use of original works without proper authorization continue to be contentious topics, often leading to legal battles over rights and compensation.
The case, filed in Louisiana, is set to proceed with both parties presenting their arguments. This legal battle could have significant implications for how artists approach sampling and crediting original works in the future.
