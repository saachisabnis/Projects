Beyoncé has received her flowers from yet another country music icon, Nancy Sinatra, eldest daughter of Frank Sinatra, following the release of her Cowboy Carter album.
Taking to X/Twitter, Sinatra spoke of the significance of being featured on Queen B’s latest album. She praised the sampling of her 1966 classic, “These Boots Are Made For Walkin’,” calling it possibly the best yet.

“To have a little piece of one of my records in a @Beyonce song is very meaningful to me because I love her,” she wrote, referencing the Cowboy Carter track “Ya Ya.” “She represents what is great about today’s music and I’m delighted to be a tiny part of it.”
She added: “This may be the best sample of ‘Boots’ yet! And the beat goes on… #Beyonce.”
In December 1965, Lee Hazlewood penned the iconic hit “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’,” which soared to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its enduring appeal spans decades, with covers by Billy Ray Cyrus, The Supremes, Megadeth, and many more.
Beyoncé’s latest album boasts an impressive roster of samples and features. With nods to The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” and selections from The Beatles and Chuck Berry, the album is a sonic feast that promises to captivate listeners of all ages.

Notably, the album showcases collaborations with legends like Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, alongside rising stars like Brittney Spencer and Tiera Kennedy, and surprise appearances from Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, and even Bey’s daughter Rumi Carter.
While Beyoncé’s musical shift was welcomed by many, not everyone is singing her praises. Azealia Banks, in particular, unleashed a scathing critique of Cowboy Carter, further fueling her ongoing criticism of the global superstar.

The controversial provocateur took to her Instagram Stories to offer her thoughts on Queen B’s new project, urging her to “find new content.”
“Absolutely not,” she declared after joking that she might have to “eat her words” when it comes to previous criticism of Bey’s turn into the Country curve. “Themes r redundant. The lyrics really are forced. Album is too long… Plus who is this imaginary adversary sis thinks still wants to hump on [JAY-Z] in 2024?

“She’s gotta find new content. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY thinks he’s even remotely attractive …. LOL,” she added before finding positive things to say about the non-vocal aspects the album. “Great work from the band/producers/engineers. Cool and interesting work on the sonics. Might be her first sonically cool attempt at being arty…”
Above all her gripes regarding Cowboy Carter, Banks particularly felt Beyoncé missed an opportunity by not featuring some of country music’s biggest names like Taylor Swift and Kacey Musgraves, among others.

“I personally would have jumped out of my seat for a KT Tunstall appearance,” she continued. “A strong dr. Luke power ballad was missing … like ‘Low’.”
Overall, Banks felt the project was a snooze, noting that she “dozed off again.”
