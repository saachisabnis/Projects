In his home, Marques Houston settles into a white sofa, his demeanor thoughtful as he prepares to release his latest album. At 43, the former child star has evolved from the precocious lead singer of R&B group Immature to a multifaceted entertainment force.
“Every story has multiple sides,” Houston says, addressing the controversies and misconceptions that have shadowed his career. “I’ve learned that silence sometimes feeds speculation.”
In a revealing two-part documentary, Houston confronts long-standing rumors head-on, including allegations about his relationship with producer Chris Stokes and how everyone was on this dissing him and Stokes campaign. Both men categorically deny claims of an intimate relationship, with Houston expressing frustration at how such rumors affected their professional legacy.
The documentary also addresses speculation surrounding his marriage to Miya Dickey Houston. Contrary to social media accusations, she explains that she had been living with her grandmother after leaving her adoptive parents’ home. She met Houston through mutual friends when she was of legal age. “We met, became friends, dated, got engaged, and now we are married,” says Miya.
Juanita Stokes, a longtime associate, defends Houston against criticism of his previous comments about dating older women. “His words about women his age having baggage were misconstrued,” she explains. “He simply wanted a woman in the same place that he is in life and to start his own family.”
Houston also clarifies a misunderstanding involving Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. He reveals that the radio station’s Hot 97 creative editing of his words sparked false dating rumors, leading to a direct conversation with Matthew Knowles, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z. “We’ve always been good friends, nothing more,” Houston emphasizes.
The artist’s frustration becomes evident when discussing industry recognition. With Chris Stokes, Houston has helped shape contemporary R&B and urban entertainment. Stokes has spent some of his own money to fund artist careers. Their discoveries include B2K, Jhene Aiko, Brandy, and many more. They have produced hit records for Destiny Childs and Genuwine.
Stokes’s film career started with writing movies House Party 4 and You Got Served. You Got Served was initially called Dance and was written for the late great Aaliyah, Dave Scott, and Ginuwine. TV One Network approached Stokes to produce a film with a $100,000 budget, and the movie Will To Love ended up being a success and birthed their company Footage Films, which is worth $200 million. They have created more than 40 movies.
In his studio, surrounded by Stokes and producer Michael Grammy, Houston appears energized about his future. The new album represents where he is now – confident, established, and ready to create on his own terms. Discussing his exciting plans for an upcoming tour, he is enthusiastic and his enthusiasm is contagious, sparking anticipation for what’s to come.
The journey from Immature’s teenage frontman to entertainment mogul has been challenging, but Houston’s resilience and determination have been truly inspiring. He maintains that every experience has contributed to his growth, a testament to his unwavering spirit.
As he prepares to release new music, Houston seems at peace with his past while firmly focused on his future. “With this album I wanted to give 100 percent,” he says, queuing up tracks from his forthcoming album. His calm acceptance of his past reassures the audience that he is ready to move forward, one note at a time.
