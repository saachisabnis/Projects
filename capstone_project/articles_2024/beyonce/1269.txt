The-Dream has been hit with very serious allegations, including rape, battery, and sex trafficking, by a former protégée in a new lawsuit filed in a California federal court on Tuesday (June 4).
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Chanaaz Mangroe claims that the super-producer (real name Terius Gesteelde-Diamant) promised to promote her and her career, but ended up violating her trust.

The lawsuit claims that The-Dream trapped her in “an abusive, violent and manipulative relationship filled with physical assaults, violent sexual encounters, and horrific psychological manipulation.”
He also allegedly promised to finance and procure her visa, promised her an opening spot on Beyoncé‘s latest tour, and even to write her a series of “blockbuster songs.” Instead, he allegedly isolated her in a hotel, had her “check in” several times a day, and would otherwise control her every move.

In 2015, The-Dream allegedly ramped up his control of Mangroe by flying her out to Atlanta, where he “locked Ms. Mangroe in a dark room adjacent to a recording studio, violently having sex with her and then leaving her alone, naked in the dark, for hours on end, returning to again have sex with her and demand that she tell him she loved him.”
Another time, he allegedly responded to a rebuffing of his advances by choking her out.

Finally, she claims that Epic Records benefitted from the super-producer’s continued alleged rape and abuse, so she is including them in the lawsuit as well.
“She was left in the dark throughout the entire process despite both Contra and Epic Records having a signed contract and owing corporate responsibilities to her, and despite agents of both entities knowing that Ms. Mangroe had been the subject of Dream’s violent and coercive manipulation, which they knew or should have known were predicated of fraudulent promises of record contracts, Grammys, and opening for Beyonce,” the lawsuit read.

The-Dream didn’t return the outlet’s request for a comment, but he did release a statement regarding the allegations.
“These claims are untrue and defamatory,” he said. “I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.”
