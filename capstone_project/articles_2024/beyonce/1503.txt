“You know those days when you just don’t wanna do it? You just gotta do it.” 
Jennifer Aniston has made it clear over the years that she doesn’t skimp on workouts. Now, she's here with a behind-the-scenes Instagram drop that's seriously impressive. 
In the video, the 55-year-old can be seen totally crushing a workout from the low-impact fitness method Pvolve (she’s a partner of the company) set to the tune of Beyoncé’s “MOVE.”
Jennifer's workout consisted of core-heavy moves like weighted mountain climbers with sliders, weighted leg raises, and a slew of yoga poses. 
Finally, The Morning Show star does a pushup before collapsing on her mat. “You know those days when you just don’t wanna do it? You just gotta do it,” she says in the video, while still lying on the ground. 
“If you’re having one of THOSE Mondays, I FEEL YOU 🫵🏼 Just gotta do it!! ❤️💪🏼💋 @pvolve,” she added in the caption. 
People cheered her on—and related—in the comments. “I know exactly how you feel,” fellow actress Octavia Spencer wrote. “PoV: me trying one push up😭,” a fan added. 
Of course, this is just old hat for Jennifer: The star previously told Women’s Health that she prioritizes making time for regular workouts (even after presenting the 59th SAG Lifetime Achievement Award to Barbra Streisand on Saturday).
“It varies from week to week, depending on a work schedule," Jennifer said. “Ideally, I would love four workout days a week, and then a day where it's more of a major walk or hike.”
 She also shared that she’s learned to be smarter about her workouts. “I can do 20 minutes and get as good of a workout as if I work for an entire hour,” she said. “You really can get an efficient workout with just a good 20 minutes if that's all the time you have—even 10 minutes of doing something that gets your body moving. I just find comfort in that.”
Jennifer revealed that she used to do 45 minutes to an hour of “constant cardio, running, and boot camp” but she stopped because her knees “can’t take it anymore.”
Now, her workouts focus on whatever she’s feeling on that day. “I just love that: build your own workout,” she said.
