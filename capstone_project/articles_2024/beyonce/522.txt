DDG has revealed that he’s received an invaluable piece of advice from JAY-Z — even though it feeds into the “dinner with Hova or $500K?” meme.
The YouTuber-turned-rapper sat down with Hollywood Unlocked on Wednesday (February 21). There, he revealed that the Hip Hop billionaire made an unforgettable food analogy when giving him business advice.

“I’ve only talked to [JAY] a few times. It ain’t like I text him and call him and shit like that, but we’ve had conversations,” DDG said. “When I do see him, I try to ask him for a little bit of game, a little bit of advice.”
He continued: “I asked him at [Beyoncé’s] birthday party, I was like, ‘What advice could you give me as an artist?’ And he gave me like an analogy. He was like, ‘If people go to a Chinese restaurant, they expecting Chinese food.’ So, give the people what they came for.”

In October of 2023, JAY-Z himself finally settled the “dinner with JAY-Z or $500K?” debate.
The Roc Nation mogul sat down with CBS News’ Gayle King for an interview inside his “Book of HOV” library exhibit in Brooklyn, where he pointed out that he’s been giving out game in his music all these years, so he’d have nothing new to add during a supposed brainstorming session over dinner.

“You gotta take the money,” he replied with little hesitation. “What I’ma say? You got all that [wisdom] in the music for $10.99! That’s a bad deal. I wouldn’t tell you to cut a bad deal. Take the $500,000, go buy some albums and listen to the albums — it’s all there!
“If you piece it together and really listen to the music for the words, for what it is, it’s all there. Everything that I said was gonna happen, happened. Everything that I said I wanted to do, I’ve done. There’s the blueprint. The blueprint, literally, to me and my life and my journey is there already.”

JAY-Z was actually poked about the “$500,000 or dinner?” debate by a fan at the Los Angeles Chargers vs. Dallas Cowboys game at SoFi Stadium the week before his interview with CBS.
“I’m taking that $500,000. I ain’t taking that dinner, I’m taking that $500,000,” the fan, who calls himself K Rich, told the Brooklyn billionaire after bumping into him inside the arena. “Aye, it’s love, though. You feel me?”
