The 2024 social season is on the horizon, which means whether you have weddings or Royal Ascot coming up, you may be on the hunt for a haute new headpiece.
 Though finding the perfect outfit for such events sometimes feels like an arduous task, it's actually the easy bit if a hat or fascinator is part of your desired ensemble (or essential, if in the Royal Enclosure).
Finding the perfect headwear can be a daunting task, particularly if you don't know where to start. But Jane Taylor - a millinery expert and founder of her eponymous brand tells H! Fashion: "There are simple ways to navigate the millinery. You must think about the occasion, because a hat for a wedding is very different from a hat for the races when you can have more fun with the design."
Jane's designs have adorned the heads of the globe's most illustrious names, from Beyoncé to the Princess of Wales, so we trust she knows a thing or two about finding the perfect fascinator.
Whether you're looking for a design to suit your face shape, pick out a piece that is on trend for 2024, or styling advice, Jane gave us a guide to everything you need to know about fascinator fashion in 2024.
If you’ve got a long face, you don’t want to extend your features by having a deep crown so choose a hat that’s asymmetrical and cuts across your face. If you’ve got a round face, go for an angular hat and if you’ve got angular features then go for flowers and veiling to soften the look. Asymmetrical shapes and brims suit everyone and are very flattering along with rounded cocktail hats.

It can be daunting to choose a hat, but there are simple ways to navigate the millinery. You must think about the occasion because a hat for a wedding is very different from a hat for the races when you can have more fun with the design.
Think about the proportion of your silhouette. If you’re wearing a 1950s dress with a big flared skirt then you want a brim that’s quite wide, whereas with a tailored suit a neat cocktail hat is better. If you’re tall, you need something substantial otherwise, it may get lost.
This summer, the world of hats and millinery is set for an elegant evolution. The classic pillbox hat, long associated with the Jackie Onassis-inspired styling of the ’50s and ’60s, is undergoing a modern transformation. I
nstead of sitting toward the back of the head, this season’s pillbox takes on a more structured, minimalist approach, positioned higher and echoing the refined silhouettes of the 1980s. With its sleek lines and understated sophistication, this updated style pairs seamlessly with tailored ensembles—think sharp trouser suits and impeccably cut pencil skirts.
Timeless yet refreshingly contemporary, it’s the perfect accessory for a polished, power-driven look. This season, we’ll see the return of oversized brimmed boaters, a trend that gained traction last year and continues to complement structured suits and tailored dresses beautifully. Also taking centre stage are headpieces, headdresses, and hairbands—each offering a distinctive way to elevate an outfit.
When it comes to colour, this season’s palette is set to be a beautiful blend of soft pastels and bold statement hues. Expect delicate shades of buttery yellow, blush pink, coral, and powder blue, accented by striking pops of scarlet red and fresh spring greens, including a chic pistachio. Of course, pink remains a perennial favourite, but this year, it takes on a bold new character—think vibrant hot pink infused with a hint of coral, perfect for both headwear and fashion. For those who prefer a more understated elegance, timeless neutrals will continue to shine. Shades of nude, mocha, crisp white, and ivory create a refined, sophisticated look, ideal for effortless styling. When chosen carefully to complement your skin tone and overall outfit, these colours can enhance your look with a natural, flattering finish.
Not necessarily. If the outfit is tonal and predominantly cream, white or black, then the fascinator chosen could be any colour. Often when an outfit is multiple colours, we would then look to match the hat to one colour in particular from the dress.
We advise our clients to bring in their chosen outfit when they visit our atelier in London, so that we can perfectly match a hat to their clothes. Equally, we often receive swatches from the dress designer which the team are then able to very precisely colour match, in order to create a bespoke piece that is the exact same colour as the outfit.
This depends on the design and how the designer intended it to be worn. We recommend you look at images of the headpiece on a model in order to ensure you’re correctly wearing the fascinator. There will often be an elastic band which is intended to run around the base of the back of the head and should be covered fully by your hair, and there is occasionally a small comb attached to the headpiece which is there to provide extra support and avoid the headpiece coming loose.
Don’t wear your hat plum on top of your head. A cocktail or small hat should sit just above your right eyebrow - it can be over the left brow but traditionally, it’s the right. Lastly, enjoy it. I love seeing the effect of wearing a hat or headpiece on how a person feels.
