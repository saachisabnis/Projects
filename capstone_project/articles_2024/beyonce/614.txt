President Joe Biden borrowed at least $50,000 against a line of credit on his vacation home last year, according to his annual financial disclosure, which the White House released on Wednesday.
Local real-estate records show that the Bidens took out a $250,000 home-equity loan on their vacation property in Rehoboth in 2022. Last year, they reported borrowing between $15,000 to $50,000 in 2022 against that line of credit, which has a variable interest rate of prime plus 1.99%. They further tapped into that line of credit over the past year, according to Wednesday’s disclosure, and now owe between $100,000 to $250,000. Asked why the first family took out more cash, a White House spokesperson provided no explanation.
The Bidens’ largest liability remains the 30-year mortgage on their main home, inked in 2013 at a 3.375% interest rate. The outstanding balance is between $250,000 and $500,000, according to the disclosure, which only requires officials to list values in broad ranges.
Their other debts total $25,000 to $65,000 and consist of a term loan and loans against their life-insurance policies.
The Bidens valued their non-real estate assets at between $1 million and $2.6 million, $700,000 to $1.6 million of which is in cash. A variable annuity, which invests in nine different mutual funds, is worth more than $135,000, while six life insurance policies are valued between $62,000 and $230,000.
Forbes estimated Joe Biden’s net worth at $10 million in April 2024, largely via his two homes, which were worth around $7 million combined.
His retirement savings are largely locked up in a government pension that pays him about $250,000 a year and does not need to be included on the annual disclosure. He also reported having an IRA with $15,000 to $50,000 in cash and a retirement plan from his teaching stint at the University of Pennsylvania, valued at more than $15,000.
Biden took in less than $400 in royalties from two books, a 2017 memoir named Promise Me Dad and a 2008 autobiography called Promises to Keep.
Jill Biden’s income consisted of her teaching salary from Northern Virginia Community College and less than $10,000 in royalties from three books.
Unlike Vice President Kamala Harris, who disclosed receiving nearly $1,700 worth of concert tickets from Beyoncé, the Bidens did not report receiving any gifts.
Biden’s main opponent in November, billionaire former President Donald Trump, requested a 45-day extension to file his personal financial disclosure. It is now due July 1.
