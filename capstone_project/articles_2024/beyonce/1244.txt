Quincy Jones, iconic music producer, passed away this week at the age of 91.
Following his passing, his family shared, "Although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him. He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity."
This couldn't be more true as Jones has played a key role helping to create some of some of the most well-known songs in the world, working with legends including Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon, and Michael Jackson, just to name a few — he is a 28-time Grammy winner, after all (the third biggest Grammy-winner of all time behind Beyoncé and Sir Georg Solti).
