The Republican candidate made headlines after accusing immigrants of eating people’s pets
The entertainment world has been reacting following the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.
The two presidential hopefuls went head to head in Philadelphia last night (September 10) in their first, and potentially only debate. It comes as both were virtually tied in the polls, and with voters set to cast their votes on November 5.
Airing live on US network ABC, the debate was held between the two without a live audience, and each candidate had their microphone muted while their opponent spoke. For Trump, it was his second presidential election debate of 2024, having already gone up against Joe Biden in June, shortly before he withdrew from the race.
During the debate, Trump mostly reiterated the rhetoric from his rallies, while Harris used her platform to share her plans for the country and address criticisms she has received throughout her campaign.
Main talking points included Trump’s widely disputed comments about abortion and crime, as well as his belief that he won the 2020 election. Harris also criticised the former President about the size of his rally crowds, claiming that “people start leaving the rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom”.
One of the most talked about moments, however, came as Trump attempted to push now-debunked claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, who were accused of abducting local pets and eating them.

“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” he said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.” Police in the area have denied that any such reports have been made.
Now, famous faces from across the entertainment industry have come forward to share their thoughts on the debate, with many poking fun at the Republican candidate and sharing their backing for Harris.
One of the most famous to speak out in endorsement of the latter is Taylor Swift, who told her 283million Instagram followers that she would be voting for Harris as she is a “steady-handed, gifted leader”.
“I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,” she added, also signing off as “Childless Cat Lady” – a reference used by Trump’s running mate Sen. JD Vance to describe women who don’t have kids.

Actor Mark Ruffalo also weighed in, writing on Twitter/X: “Honestly, I was anxious about this debate but what is clear is that Kamala not only has a vision for the future and lifting America up but she is just so much even-tempered and so much smarter than Trump. She crushed him.”
He also shared another comment comparing the Democratic candidate to Muhammad Ali: “It was like watching Muhammad Ali: she baited him and then let him swing wildly until he sputtered out.”

Star Wars icon Mark Hamill continued his longtime criticism of Trump by describing him as “angry, defensive and weird,” and pointing out what he saw as weak points in his arguments.
Lizzo took to Instagram to share a screengrab of the televised debate, showing Harris looking at her opponent with a concerned expression and writing the caption: “Same”, while Ariana Grande shared a post from Evan Ross Katz on her Instagram Story which read: “D*nald Tr*mp was fired by 81million people… clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that.”

Elsewhere, Halloween and Knives Out star Jamie Lee Curtis shared a meme on her Instagram Stories, which highlighted the misinformation and blunders Trump has made in recent speeches.
In other news about the upcoming Presidential election, Spinal Tap became the latest act to ban Donald Trump from playing their music at his rallies yesterday (September 10). This came shortly after news emerged that The White Stripes were suing Trump over the unauthorised use of ‘Seven Nation Army’. Before filing the suit, Jack White last month warned the president’s campaign not to use his music. “Oh….Don’t even think about using my music you fascists,” he wrote in a post on Instagram.
Elsewhere, Isaac Hayes’ estate is suing Trump for $3million (£2.28m) after allegedly finding over 130 instances where the song was used at his campaign rallies without permission. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Trump and his campaign must stop using Hayes’ song ‘Hold On, I’m Coming’.
Throughout the last year alone, ABBA have also demanded Trump stop using their music, and Beyoncé reportedly threatened the former president with legal action for using her song ‘Freedom’ in a social media video.
Celine Dion said she did not endorse the use of her iconic song ‘My Heart Will Go On’ too, while Johnny Marr “shut down” his use of The Smiths’ ‘Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want’.
