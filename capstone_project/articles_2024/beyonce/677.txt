"Love was made for me and you." ðŸ’•
Valentineâ€™s Day is right around the corner, so you know what that means: itâ€™s time to start planning the perfect day for your partner, parent, or close friend. (Yes, your family and best friends still deserve all the love on V-Day, too!). While you canâ€™t go wrong with a heart-shaped box of chocolates and a bouquet of roses, many people might prefer something a bit more sentimental.
But letâ€™s be honest, words can be tricky, and you want to make sure your message comes across in the most authentic and heartfelt way possible. With that in mind, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with getting a bit of help to find the right words.
Now, you donâ€™t want your card or Instagram caption to solely be someone elseâ€™s writing words. Instead, think of these Valentineâ€™s Day quotes as an accessory you can use to beef up your personal, sentimental words from the heart. Not sure where to look? Womenâ€™s Health went ahead and garnered a list of the best Valentineâ€™s Day quotes from influential figures, singers, movies, songs (Ed Sheeran, Iâ€™m looking at you), and more that you might want to use this season and beyond. Whether youâ€™re looking for something super sappy and romantic or one thatâ€™s more lighthearted and playful, WH has you covered.
