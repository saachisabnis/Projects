Usher is the latest chart-topping superstar set to bring his concert to the big screen.
The “Confessions” crooner’s eight-show residency in France, filmed during Paris Fashion Week at La Seine Musicale in June, is expected to play in approximately 2,000 movie theaters worldwide for a four-day run beginning Sept. 12.
Tickets for “Usher: Rendezvous in Paris” go on sale Aug. 6.
According to Tuesday’s announcement, the cinematic foray will feature hit songs such as “Yeah!,” “My Boo,” and “Love In This Club,” alongside a glimpse at Usher’s life beyond the stage.
“Paris was a special experience for me as an entertainer and for my fans,” the 45-year-old said in a statement. “I hope those who weren’t able to make it in person get to experience how special it was. As for those of you who were, I hope you experience the show and see what it takes to get there through a different lens.”
“Usher: Rendezvous in Paris” follows the 2023 release of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” and “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” both of which helped revitalize the big screen box office in the aftermath of the Hollywood writers strike.
Usher will kick off his Past Present Future Tour on Aug. 14 in his hometown of Atlanta. The multi-city trek is scheduled to play four dates at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center in early September.
