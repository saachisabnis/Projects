 Since it first began selling out stadiums in the summer of 2023, the Eras Tour has been through many evolutions. The 100-plus shows have brought costume changes, surprise performances, an album release, a rotating cast of VIP guests, and different surprise songs nearly every night. But one constant throughout the nearly two-year-long tour, (besides its ability to make headlines) has been the concertgoer's reliably on-theme outfits.

 Alongside Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour, the Eras Tour revolutionized concert dressing. Forget jeans and a tee—Eras Tour guests arrive in sequin-covered droves, replicating costumes from Taylor Swift's music videos, album covers, live performances, and red carpet appearances. And before the record-breaking tour comes to its conclusion this winter, Taylor Swift returned stateside for three shows in Miami. With at least two new costumes, a surprise performance from Florence Welch, several Kelces present, and a stadium full of Swifties who recreated dozens of Swift's most famous looks (and even one of her ex-boyfriend's) the shows promised to be memorable.

 InStyle was on the scene to ask concertgoers what inspired their enchanted outfits. Here, find the best looks from The Eras Tour Miami stop and the pop culture moments they were inspired by.
