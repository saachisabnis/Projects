Chrissy Teigen proudly flaunted her breast lift scars while rocking a plunging gown for a romantic night out with her husband, John Legend. 
The “Cravings” author, 38, shared a video of herself in the flirty and revealing black satin dress to her Instagram Story on Tuesday night.
“Date night! Very rare but it happens,” Teigen said in the video as Legend, 45, approached her in the background.
The model then lifted her breast to show off a small scar, adding, “Boobies out. scars out.”
Teigen accessorized with a gold body chain adorned with small charms that draped from her neck, down her chest and wrapped around her torso.
She explained that the body chain “hides” her scars. 
As for her hair, Teigen wore her brown tressed in a sleek lob blowdried in tousled, face-framing waves.
The “All of Me” singer, 45, was also dressed to the nines for their special evening for two by opting for a black button-down shirt, black pants and shiny black shoes. 
Teigen has not been shy about showing off her breast-lift scars to the world. In March, she wore a sheer corset top by Jasmin Erbas that fully revealed the marks while attending Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s annual Oscars 2024 “Gold Party.”
“When the flash hits your boob lift scars 🔥🔥🔥” she captioned Instagram photos from the event’s red carpet, joking, “You’re all zooming I can feel it!!!”
Earlier in the evening, her scars made an appearance yet again as she posed in a sheer silver gown with floral appliques at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscars party. 
The mom of four has been transparent about her plastic surgery over the years. 
Teigen, who got implants when she was 20 years old, revealed that she had them removed and her chest reduced and lifted in 2020 after giving birth to her first two children, Luna and Miles.
The Sports Illustrated cover girl also shares daughter Esti and son Wren with Legend, whom she married in 2013. 
They also welcomed their son Jack in 2020, but he tragically died from a “life-saving abortion” after she suffered a stillbirth at 20 weeks pregnant.
