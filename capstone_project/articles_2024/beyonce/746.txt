Beyoncé and Travis Scott could be releasing a new joint on the former’s highly-anticipated upcoming album, Cowboy Carter.
A short snippet of the collaborative track can be heard on a sponsored Instagram Story promoting pre-orders for the album, with the brief eight-second ad featuring synths and ad-libs from La Flame. Neither Bey nor Scott have confirmed the rapper’s appearance on the album, however, leaving fans to wait for the project’s official release next week.
Cowboy Carter marks the second chapter in Beyoncé’s RENAISSANCE trilogy, and although it’s widely speculated to be a country album thanks to its previous singles “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM” and “16 CARRIAGES,” the artist herself clarified, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a Beyoncé’ album.” In a lengthy and heartfelt statement she wrote as she unveiled the album art, she wrote:
“This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t. But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive. It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history.
The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me. act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.
I have a few surprises on the album, and have collaborated with some brilliant artists who I deeply respect. I hope that you can hear my heart and soul, and all the love and passion that I poured into every detail and every sound.”
