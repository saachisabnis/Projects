Naomi Campbell might be one of the original 90s Supermodels, but at 53 she's still in demand. The icon effortlessly graced the cover of Harper's Bazaar France N°13, channeling a sporty chic vibe in a black athletic cropped jersey emblazoned with the number "00" and low-rise jeans. The black-and-white cover, shot by leading fashion photographer Karim Sadli, is another monumental moment for the legendary Campbell who has appeared on over 500 magazine covers during her four-decade reign in fashion.
A disruptor from the start, Campbell has paved the way for many Black models through her fearless history-making covers. She was the first Black woman to front some of the industry's most prestigious publications including British Vogue (December 1987), French Vogue (August 1988), TIME magazine (September 1991) and Vogue Australia (June 1997). She then returned to British Vogue's cover in classic Naomi Campbell fashion, sweetly holding her then 9-month-old daughter.
The decorated muse also fronted the March 2024 cover for Vogue Australia, where she recalled the impact and fallout of the first time she modeled for the magazine. "My first Australian Vogue cover was with Marion Hume, whose job got compromised over it. So, imagine how far Australian Vogue has come," Campbell said in a January 2024 interview for the publication. "In that sense, I feel like the Diversity Coalition—and the work that Bethann Hardison, Iman, and I continue to do—has had some effect, because there have definitely been changes in the industry."'

Campbell's imprint in fashion is so palpable that stars like Beyoncé have used the model as creative inspiration. She famously referenced her runway walk in Brown Skin Girl, "Pose like a trophy when Naomi's walkin', She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin." And the timeless model continues to prove that ruling the runways with such unforgettable moves and motherhood are ageless, similarly to Christy Turlington, another prominent model of that era.
Ahead, we celebrate the most iconic moments in Campbell's unmatched career. From her days as a Gianni Versace muse in safety pin dresses to wearing naked dresses for the latest runways like Dolce & Gabbana's fall 2024 collection.
Balmain, 2024
