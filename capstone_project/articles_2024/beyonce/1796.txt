Ruth Langsford was seen still wearing her wedding ring in her latest social media post on Thursday, amid her shock split from husband Eamonn Holmes. 
The Loose Women presenter and broadcaster, both 64, announced their plans to divorce last month after 14 years of marriage and 27 years together. 
Taking to her Instagram Stories Ruth modelled a trendy outfit from her QVC range with the sparkler visible on her left hand as she held up her phone to capture the mirror selfie.
Posing up a storm she cut a stylish figure in a navy utility jacket, cargo trousers and wedge trainers which she layered over a sparkly T-shirt. 
Last week it was claimed a pal of Ruth's said she was left 'devastated' when she discovered 'messages from another woman' to Eamonn.

While Ruth did not comment on the claims, following the revelation she appeared to take a thinly veiled dig at her estranged as she filmed herself walking their dog Maggie - who is in the centre of a custody battle between the exes. 
The Instagram post was simply captioned 'Maggie. Happy Sunday', however, it was set to the song Pretty Girls Walk by Big Boss Vette - which details moving on from an ex. 
In the song - which was a viral TikTok audio in early 2023 - lyrics reference moving on from hearsay.
It opens with the lines: 'No matter what the f**k these h**s talkin' 'bout / Just know you a bad b***h'. 
The song also refers to moving on with a new partner, with the lyrics: 'Sh***in' on my ex (f**k him), on to the next (on God)'.
MailOnline has contacted Ruth's representatives for comment.  
The post came after it was claimed Ruth was 'upset' at rumours the reason for her split from Eamonn was due to his health issues.
Eamonn has suffered various health woes in recent years including crippling back pain and a bout of shingles - with Ruth being by his side looking after him throughout.

And Ruth has been left sad that rumours have circulated that this contributed to their separation, according to The Sun.
It has been claimed a pal of Ruth's has said she was left 'devastated' when she discovered 'messages from another woman' on Eamonn's laptop - which was reportedly the real reason they split.
Eamonn praised Ruth for her 'amazing' support after he suffered a fall down stairs of their home in November 2022.

In 2016, Eamonn underwent a double-hip replacement operation lasting three-and-a-quarter hours after living with acute pain for many years.
Then in 2018 Eamonn detailed his battle with shingles and how he was struck with the virus on his son Declan's wedding day. 
His years of chronic back pain started in spring 2021 - which came completely out of nowhere.
The pain become so severe that it left Eamonn reliant on a walking stick, but soon found out the root cause.  
He eventually discovered it was three slipped discs that affected the movement of his right leg.
In September 2022, Eamonn was forced to step away from his GB news show as he underwent vital back surgery to aid his chronic back pain.  
Then in November 2022 Eamonn endured a horrific accident which saw him fall down a set of stairs at his home in Surrey leading him to break his shoulder weeks after his huge spinal surgery. 
Ruth recently said she 'lives in hope' that his mobility will improve.
Speaking to Woman's Weekly, she said: 'I don't know how much Eamonn's mobility will improve. We live in hope.
'He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100% right. With any care situation - and there are millions of carers in this country - it isn't always easy. It's testing but we manage as a family.'
Ruth added: 'I look at Eamonn, who's had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.'
It comes as it has been claimed a pal of Ruth's has said she was left 'devastated' when she discovered 'messages from another woman' on Eamonn's laptop.
A source told The Sun: 'Ruth was completely taken by surprise when she saw the messages.
'She had no idea what had been going on between them. She was devastated.'
They added: 'Not only was she very upset but she was also angry.'
The publication previously reported Eamonn had grown close to a younger female friend over the past year  - a blonde divorcée and relationship counsellor - who he has been on a 'string of outings with'.
MailOnline has contacted Eamonn's representative. Ruth's representative declined to comment.
Ruth's friends reportedly insisted that there is 'no chance' she will reunite with Eamonn. 
She has reportedly been left hurt and is taking an extended break from Loose Women after discovering he is being consoled by woman in her forties amid their split who he's befriended.
Eamonn and the blonde divorcee reportedly struck up a friendship over the past couple of years and the publication claims the presenter has taken her on a safari park trip, to a Manchester United game and a Beyoncé concert. 
This week, a pal of Ruth's told The Mirror: 'Ruth was hurt when she learned about Eamonn's friendship with another woman but she is strong and she will be back soon with a smile on her face, putting her best foot forward, as she always does. 
'She needs a bit of time to regroup after everything that's gone on, which is understandable, but she plans to return to Loose Women, with renewed vigour, in July.'
The friend also insisted there was 'no chance whatsoever' the pair would ever get back together.
Reports claim Eamonn and the woman made contact through social media after both being involved with a mental health charity.
A spokesperson for Ruth has said: 'Ruth had holiday time booked from Loose Women and has extended her leave. She's looking forward to returning to the show in due course.'
Eamonn and Ruth recently revealed they are headed for divorce after work commitments 'took their marriage in different directions'.
While Eamonn's new friendship is not said to be a reason for the marriage breakdown it is understood that Ruth was unaware of her until recently and has decided to take time off work. 
The source said: 'Ruth was obviously aware that her marriage was crumbling, but as details emerge, her upset has turned to anger. 
The post came after it was claimed Ruth was 'upset' at rumours the reason for her split from Eamonn was due to his health issues
The broadcaster has suffered from long-term difficulties, previously telling of his battle with chronic back pain after a dislocated pelvis led to three slipped discs 
'Eamonn's friend is bowled over by being lavished with attention and kindness from him.'
The pair met via Twitter after the woman commented on a post and it sparked a conversation between the pair. 
Friends explained that the woman's counselling skills include coping with 'feeling sad' and 'separation and divorce' therefore it seems fitting she will be supporting Eamonn at this time of uncertainty. 
MailOnline have contacted Eamonn's representatives for comment.
