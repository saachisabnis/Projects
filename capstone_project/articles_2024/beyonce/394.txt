The Seven Nation Army is apparently retreating.
In the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election, The White Stripes have dropped their copyright infringement lawsuit against the Donald Trump campaign for using their signature song without their permission.
Attorneys for the Grammy-winning rock duo filed legal documents in New York federal court to voluntarily dismiss the complaint. A reason was not stated in the one-sentence motion. Reps for Jack and Meg White — who dissolved the band in 2011 — have also not commented about the decision to cease litigation.
According to Billboard, the motion was filed “without prejudice,” meaning the case can be refiled at some point in the future.
Last Wednesday, Jack White didn’t mince words when expressing his disdain over the outcome of the polarizing political race.
“Trump won the popular vote. End of story,” he wrote on Instagram. “Americans chose a known, obvious fascist and now America will get whatever this wannabe dictator wants to enact from here on in.”
White threatened Trump with legal action on Aug. 28 after the Republican’s presidential campaign allegedly used a riff of “Seven Nation Army” in a promotional video posted on social media.
The opening of the 2003 chart-topping track was the backdrop of a clip in which the 78-year-old MAGA candidate was seen boarding a plane on the campaign trail, while traveling to stops in Michigan and Wisconsin.
In the lawsuit, The White Stripes objected to not only the “flagrant misappropriation” of their work, but also to the implication of their support for the 34-time convicted felony, whose policies and actions they “vehemently oppose.”
The group’s public defiance against Trump was among a growing chorus of musicians — including Beyoncé, The Rolling Stones, Celine Dion, Abba and the estate of Isaac Hayes — who took legal action against his campaign for using their music without permission.
