The Louvre has long been an obligatory item on the itinerary of any first-time visitor to Paris. France’s national art museum boasts the highest footfall of any gallery in the world: millions more than its closest rivals, the Vatican and the British Museum. A striking part of its success is that nearly half of its 8.9 million visitors last year were under 26, and data shows the majority of the museum’s patrons are visiting for the first time.
The Louvre’s notable success in cultivating its youthful audience is in no small part down to its having mastered the art of social media. Consult TikTok and one finds videos with millions of views attempting to pique the interest of younger art-lovers with tips about the museum.
