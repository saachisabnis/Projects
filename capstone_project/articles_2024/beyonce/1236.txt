Beyoncé‘s been a hitmaker ever since she stepped onto the music scene as part of Destiny’s Child.
Her musical golden touch has continued well into her solo career, with her single, “Jolene” marking her milestone 24th Billboard Hot 100 top 10 as a soloist, and “Texas Hold ‘Em” marked her ninth No. 1 total. Bey released “Texas Hold ‘Em” as the first single from her upcoming Cowboy Carter album on Super Bowl Sunday.
Her first song to crack the top 10 in her solo career was 2003’s “Crazy in Love,” featuring Bey’s now-husband, Jay-Z. The track was her first of seven Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s apart from Destiny’s Child (with whom she achieved four leaders). “Crazy in Love” enjoyed an eight-week command on the Hot 100.
Since then, Beyoncé has seen Hot 100 success with mega-hits including “Irreplaceable,” “Baby Boy,” “Check On It,” “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” and many more.
