Megan Thee Stallion is opening this week’s Billboard 200 at No. 3 with MEGAN.
The Houston Hottie’s latest studio effort marks her sixth top 10 effort and debuts with a total of 64,000 equivalent album units in its first week, including 47,000 in streaming equivalent album units (62.67 million on-demand streams of the songs), 16,000 in album sales and 1,000 in track equivalent album units. MEGAN is officially 2024’s biggest debut for a rap album by a woman by units so far, and is also the year’s first top 10-charting rap album by a woman.
Elsewhere on the chart is Taylor Swift, who logs her 11th week at No. 1, followed by Morgan Wallen at No. 2, Billie Eilish at No. 4 and Chappell Roan at No. 5 — the last of which marks the first time that The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess has entered the top five.
