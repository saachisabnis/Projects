	Looking for a setting spray that goes the distance? Whether you plan to brave Coachella’s desert temperatures or another outdoor music festival, Tems might have perfected a setting-spray technique that delivers maximum hold – even onstage.

	Makeup artist Kayla Perez posted footage of the “Essence” singer’s Coachella glam session on TikTok on Tuesday (April 16), and it featured a trio of viral beauty products including Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Setting Spray, One/Size On ‘Til Dawn Setting Spray and Kryolan Professional Fixing Spray.

	In the video, Perez starts off with Charlotte Tilbury, followed by One/Size and Kryolan Fixing Spray to finish off the look. And it worked like a charm, according to Tems.

	“Makeup didn’t move!” she proclaims in the video.

	While the average makeup girlies probably won’t need to use three settings sprays at once, Tems proves just how good each product works and how well they complement each other.

	Patrick Starrr’s One/Size On ‘Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray earned Beyoncé’s stamp of approval and Tems can now vouch for its powerful, all-day hold and matte finish.  

Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray is an alcohol- and oil-free spray that hydrates and holds for up to 16 hours. The setting spray is available at retailers such as Ulta Beauty, Sephora, Kohl’s, Nordstrom and Charlottetilbury.com.

	Tems made her Coachella debut over the weekend with surprise appearances from Wizkid and Justin Bieber. The 28-year-old recording artist also announced that her debut album, Born in the Wild, drops in May.

	As for Coachella, the annual music festival wraps up this weekend. Get tickets to here.
