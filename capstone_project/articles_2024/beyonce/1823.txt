Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena buzzed with excitement during the 2024 CMA Awards on November 20, but one moment sparked an unexpected controversy. During Cody Johnson’s acceptance speech for Album of the Year, his producer, Trent Willmon, raised eyebrows with a comment that many interpreted as a jab at rising star Shaboozey.
“It takes an army of people to make a great record, but I gotta tell ya, this is for this cowboy who’s been kicking Shaboozey for a lot of years, y’all,” Willmon said. The remark quickly went viral, leaving fans puzzled about whether it was a dig or an awkward attempt at humor.
Shaboozey, nominated for New Artist of the Year and Single of the Year for his smash hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” didn’t let the moment overshadow his night. The track, which has led the Billboard Hot 100 for 18 nonconsecutive weeks, has made Shaboozey a standout in the music scene.
In response to the controversy, Shaboozey posted a photo of himself on social media after the show with the caption, “Ain’t nobody kicking me!” The lighthearted comment resonated with fans, who praised his poise and sense of humor.
While Shaboozey left the CMAs without a trophy, his career is far from slowing down. The 29-year-old artist is a frontrunner at the 2025 Grammy Awards, boasting five nominations, including Best Country Song, Best New Artist, and Song of the Year for “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” He’s also recognized for Best Melodic Rap Performance for his collaboration with Beyoncé and Linda Martell on “Spaghettii.”
Online, fans expressed confusion and anger over Willmon’s comment, with some calling it unprofessional and unnecessary. Others questioned the intent, debating whether it was meant as sarcasm or a genuine slight.
Regardless, Shaboozey’s rising stardom seems unstoppable. As one fan tweeted, “Shaboozey is winning with his music, and no comment can change that.”
