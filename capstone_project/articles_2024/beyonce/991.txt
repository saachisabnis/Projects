Sofia Richie is no stranger to the world of luxury fashion. After all, she wore custom Chanel her entire wedding weekend in the South of France (casual). At this point, the David Yurman brand ambassador has basically become the face of the quiet luxury trend. It’s no surprise that some of her go-to designer brands include The Row, Khaite and Loewe — elevated yet accessible. That’s why we were shocked to see her rocking Levi’s jeans in her latest Instagram post!
On New Year’s Eve, Richie posted pics wearing an all-American outfit: a plain white tee and faded blue jeans (our daily uniform), along with a Bottega Veneta bag (high-low, baby!). We quickly identified the denim as the Levi’s 501s, an iconic pair of jeans that have stood the test of time. Fun fact: these jeans were the blueprint for all blue jeans, invented by Levi’s over 150 years ago. Unlike other items in Richie’s closet, these jeans retail for under $100! We love it when celebrity style is in our budget.
