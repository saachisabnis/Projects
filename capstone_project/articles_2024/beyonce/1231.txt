it’s one thing to doubt ‘eternal sunshine’s chances in best pop vocal album, but it’s pure hate-fuelled delusion to not even have Ariana top 4 in best pop solo performance 
Not really, Ariana is not well liked by The Grammys & Billie’s a Grammy darling, while the other artists have the type of safe smash songs that The Grammys eat up. If anything I do think she’s 5th place in that category.

I loved the album, but I do worry about how Pop appealing it might be. Outside of “Lunch” (which is kinda a Bad Guy redux) nothing really sounds like a big hit. Funny enough, I think it’s still the most likely AOTY contender to win though. Even if it doesn’t get full pop support, alt and rock will eat this up. 
I agree, even if I think the album outstanding, beside Lunch and L’Amour de ma vie, I don’t know what could be a hit

as opposed to Hozier, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter? 🤣🤣
also, the pop voters clearly really like Ariana. you’re talking total nonsense

why would ariana be 5th when she has one of the biggest pop songs of the year lol. and while billie is loved by the academy her history in the pop field is not the greatest, she only has 1 pop grammy. also in what world is ‘espresso’ and ‘beautiful things’ a “safer” choice for a pop solo win than ‘we can’t be friends’?😭

Benson and Sabrina haven’t had the opportunity to shine at Grammys until now, & Hozier’s last smash hit was nominated in Song of the Year. I know it’s a lot to process for you but Ariana isn’t the only one smashing in pop this year.

i’m very much aware she isn’t the only one smashing in pop? i never said i think she will win (although actually, i think she might), i just said that having her out of the top 5 is delusional
Benson and Sabrina are contenders but there’s no way for us to know how much voters will like them. Billie’s track record is poor in this category so whilst a nomination seems very likely, i’m doubtful about a win
Hozier is being crazily overrated by the forum, i feel

Maybe because Espresso, Too Sweet, and Beautiful Things are simply performing better? Espresso gives me Watermelon Sugar vibes & I expect it to perform well all throughout the summer, while Beautiful Things is a hit rock song, I don’t know how you can get anymore safe than that at The Grammys…

95 on Metacritic and 89 on Album of the Year… Yeah Pop Vocal Album is in her hands

But that’s exactly their point… Grammys, and especially the pop block, prefer established artists over newcomers/one hit wonders. Also it’s not like WCBF is some nothing song while the others are huge smashes, they’re all generally on the same level success wise (with WCBF actually going number one unlike Espresso and Beautiful Things).
Also at the end of the day Grammys do care about quality. WCBF is a good song that will definitely appeal to pop voters and has an emotional pull; I think it is the frontrunner by a lot unless Billie can get a smash hit.
so happy for billie to be receiving all the acclaim!! Love her. If I could choose anyone of the current big pop artists to collab with Harry, it would be her. she has good consistency in having fun, original musical moments in her projects. exciting.
“The young superstar’s sensual heartbreak masterpiece is great enough to stand alongside Joni Mitchell’s Blue.” – The Telegraph on Billie’s new album…
Yeah, Billie is taking that 2nd AOTY, and if she gets a smash hit, she’ll take SOTY and ROTY too.
Beyoncé will win an album and song category for COWBOY CARTER & TEXAS HOLD ‘EM. Taylor’s sole win will be Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for Fortnight. Hozier, Billie, Benson, or Sabrina take BPSP. BPVA = Billie. Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande will go home empty handed.
Ariana wins Best Pop Dance Recording

when was the last time a “hit rock song” won a pop grammy? and sabrina has been trying to get nominated for YEARS and has failed every time, so how much would they like her over an established grammy winner like ariana? not to mention ariana has an emotional pull to her song which if you look at the past 3 winners for pop solo, has been a constant theme with the winners.
In terms of nomination, an established pop fave with a hit song will always be ahead of newcomers (especially khia ones like Benson Boone) or one hit wonders.
I actually have no idea why this forum is so fixed on “Too Sweet”, by the way. Hozier gets routinely passed over in the Rock/Alternative field and the song is already bleeding out.
