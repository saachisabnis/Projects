Plies has seen some of the headlines crediting Taylor Swift with creating the “Swag Surfin'” trend, and he’s none too pleased about this turn of events.
The Florida native took to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (January 23) to set the record straight on the narrative that the pop star is responsible for popularizing the dance.

“I Luv Seeing Taylor Swift & The Kansas City Chiefs Rock Out To ‘Swag Surfing’ On Sundays,” he wrote, referencing Swift’s recent antics while cheering on her Chiefs boyfriend Travis Kelce. “But Media Let’s Stop Acting Like They Created It!”
Reminding the world who’s actually responsible for “Swag Surfin,'” he added: “Let’s Give Props To F.L.Y, Atlanta & The HBCU Community For Birthing The Phenomenon!!”
A number of mainstream articles, such as those put out by PEOPLE and TODAY, have indeed credited the Fast Life Yungstaz (F.L.Y.)’s song of the same name with the origination of the dance.
However, few have mentioned the impact that HBCUs have played on the lasting popularity of the song, nor have they expounded on its development from a regional hit to a global phenomenon.

But back in 2022, HipHopDX spoke to music executive Citi Under Siege, who opened up about his role in the cultural explosion that was Fast Life Yungstaz’s 2009 hit.
The Run It Up Records CEO explained how the song went from a local hit to one of the most recognizable songs of the last decade.

Citi said he first heard “Swag Surfin'” at a college bar in Georgia when it was a bubbling underground cut and instantly recognized its potential to be something greater.
“As soon as the beat drops, every kid in the club jumps up,” he recalled. “I promise you, the roof lifts off the club. It was the most magical music moment I’ve ever seen in my life.”

After witnessing its power, Citi promised himself he would make it his mission to get more ears on the song. “I’m going to make sure that everybody in the world sees what I just saw,” he recalled saying to himself.
The song didn’t quite reach No. 1 on the charts, but it did go on to become a Black college national anthem. “It’s the record they play to unite everybody,” Citi added.

Entire arenas have danced to the song in unison, college sports teams still use the song as a way to unite the crowd and even Beyoncé incorporated the dance into her iconic Coachella Homecoming performance.
Lil Wayne also borrowed the track to open up his 2009 mixtape, No Ceilings.
