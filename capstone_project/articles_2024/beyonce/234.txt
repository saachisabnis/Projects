Future and Metro Boomin have the most popular album in America. The rapper/producer duo’s We Still Don’t Trust You dethroned Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER for the No. 1 spot this week, opening with roughly 127,500 first-week units. 
We Still Don’t Trust You serves as the sequel to We Don’t Trust You, which dropped in March. The project took the pole position three weeks after the latter led the rankings with more than 251,000 first-week units. Future now has 10 chart-topping projects on the Billboard 200. That total puts him in a fourth place tie with Eminem for rap artists. Eminem reached that milestone with 2020’s Music to Be Murdered By.
Jay-Z holds the all-time record for most No. 1 albums by a rapper. The Brooklyn-raised mogul has 14 Billboard 200 leaders. Drake comes in second with 13, followed by Kanye “Ye” West with 11.
Future and Metro Boomin recruited The Weeknd, Brownstone, Ty Dolla $ign, J. Cole, Lil Baby and A$AP Rocky as guest features for the We Still Don’t Trust You LP. Metro handled the production for the entire body of work.
