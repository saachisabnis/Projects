Beyoncé has simply made a 2-year-old’s day, week, month and maybe even year with this sweet gesture.
A video went viral of the 2-year-old boy, Tyler, who asked his mom about where his friend, Beyonce, was. His mother informs him, “he’s not mama’s friend,” he sweetly replies: “Beyoncé is my friend.”
The video even caught the attention of Beyonce’s mother, Tina Knowles. “This little boy is so adorable,” she captions the video.

The video was widely shared across all social media platforms and even caught the attention of the Queen Bey. Her publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, sent a DM to Beau Fabregas who is the young boys mom, and let know that Bey would like to send him a gift. 
“For the record @beyonce and Tyler are now actually, officially friends!” Fabregas wrote. “Through the power of Queen B’s internet (millions of views and likes it’s crazy!) she saw the video and sent over some of her favorite blue flowers, a new animal best friend for Tyler and the sweetest message that our family will now always treasure.”
“In her note (which she started out with ‘To my friend Tyler’) she said, ‘I see your halo, Tyler.”
She continued: “Thank you so much for thinking of our little family @yvettenoelschure @beyonce. I mean with the amount of mentions and videos Beyonce gets everyday, it still blows our mind to know time was set aside to send this sweet gift over. My mama heart.
“Thank you to everyone who shared it, commented, liked it. Tyler maybe too young to remember all this, but i’ll always remind him to dream big and shoot for the stars!! BEYONCE SENT MY BABY FLOWERS!!!!”
