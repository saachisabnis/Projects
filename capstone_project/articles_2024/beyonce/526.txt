Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have endorsed Kamala Harris in her White House bid, as the vice president builds momentum to become the Democratic Party's likely nominee. 
CHICAGO — "Brats for Harris." "We need a Kamalanomenon." "Gen Z feels the Kamalove."
In the days since President Joe Biden exited the presidential race July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Gen Z voters jumped to social media to share coconut tree and "brat summer" memes — reflecting a stark shift in tone for a generation that's voiced feeling left behind by the Democratic party.
Youth-led progressive organizations warned for months that Biden had a problem with young voters, pleading with the president to work more closely with them to refocus on the issues most important to younger generations or risk losing their votes.
With Biden out of the race, many of these young leaders now hope Harris can overcome his faltering support among Gen Z and harness a new explosion of energy among young voters.
Vice President Kamala Harris, walking left, waves as she arrives to speak Thursday during the American Federation of Teachers' 88th national convention in Houston.
Statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country, including in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, California, Minnesota, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, as leaders thanked Biden for stepping aside and celebrated the opportunity to organize around a new candidate. On Friday, a coalition of 17 youth-led groups endorsed Harris.
“This changes everything,” said Zo Tobi, director of communication for the Movement Voter Project, a national progressive funding group focusing on youth-led organizations, when he heard that Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. “The world as it is suddenly shifted into the world as it could be.”
As the campaign enters a new phase, both Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are expected to target messages aimed at younger voters who could prove decisive in some of the most hotly contested states.
John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics who has worked with Biden, said the "white-hot energy" among young people is something he hasn't seen since former President Barack Obama's campaign. While there's little reliable polling so far, he described the dynamic as "a combination of the hopefulness we saw with Obama and the urgency and fight we saw after the Parkland shooting."
In many ways, it was the first time many young people felt heard and felt like their actions could have an impact on politics, he and several young leaders said.
"It's reset this election in profound ways," he said. "People, especially young people, for so long, for so many important reasons have been despondent about politics, despondent about the direction of the country. It's weighed on them. And then they wake up the next morning, and it seems like everything's changed."
About 6 in 10 adults under 30 voted for Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, but his ratings with the group dipped substantially since then, with only about a quarter of the group saying they had a favorable opinion of him in the most recent AP-NORC poll, conducted before Biden withdrew from the race.
That poll, along with polls from The New York Times/Siena and from CNN that were conducted after Biden dropped out, suggest Harris started off with somewhat better favorable ratings than Biden among young adults.
Sunjay Muralitharan, vice president of College Democrats of America, said it felt like a weight was lifted off his chest when Harris entered the race.
Despite monthly coalition calls between youth-led groups and the Biden campaign, Muralitharan spent months worrying about how Biden would fare among young voters as he watched young people leave organizations such as the College Democrats and Young Democrats to join more leftist groups.
College Democrats issued statements and social media posts encouraging the party to prioritize young people and to change course on the war in Gaza and "worked tirelessly to get College Dems programming" at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this summer. They received limited outreach in return, Muralitharan said.
Harris' campaign represents an opportunity to move in a new direction, he said. The vice president demonstrated her vocal support for issues important to young voters such as climate change and reproductive rights, Muralitharan said, adding that also she may be able to change course and distance herself from Biden's approach to the war in Gaza.
"The perpetual roadblock we've run into is that Biden is the lesser of two evils and his impact on the crisis in Gaza," he said. "For months, we've been given this broken script that's made it difficult for us to organize young voters. But that changes now."
Santiago Mayer, executive director of the Gen Z voter engagement organization Voters of Tomorrow, said the Biden campaign "created an entirely new framework for operating with youth organizations" that can now be transitioned into supporting Harris' campaign.
"Gen Z loves VP Harris, and VP Harris loves Gen Z," he said. "So we're ready to get to work for her."
