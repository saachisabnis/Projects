Bradley Cooper recounted a memorable visit to Beyoncé's home to discuss her potential role in his 2018 movie, A Star Is Born. During a recent interview with the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, Cooper shared how he pitched the film to Greg Silverman after the success of American Sniper in 2014. Silverman agreed to proceed with the project on the condition that it could be made for under $25 million and that Beyoncé would be involved. Cooper vividly remembered visiting Beyoncé's home and finding JAY-Z watching Judge Judy.
Despite Beyoncé ultimately not joining the cast, Cooper successfully secured Lady Gaga for the lead role. Their collaboration on the film resulted in winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Shallow." Cooper is currently promoting his latest movie, Maestro, where he portrays conductor Leonard Bernstein, a film that has received a nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
