Azealia Banks has reportedly been asked to move out of a home she was renting in a small Florida town just south of Miami for failing to pay rent.
A partial court document made its way online on Friday (July 5), shedding light on the latest development in an ongoing legal battle between Banks and Isis Claro — the owner of the Palmetto Bay, Florida home.

Per the dispossessory notice, Claro has requested that the courts force the rapper and controversial social media figure to abandon the property. Banks responded to the original legal request for rent, which prevented a “clerk’s default” allowing the landlord to kick her out immediately.
However, the Harlem native has yet to make the necessary payment to cover her back rent. The documents printed online did not specify an amount, but AllHipHop reports Banks is approximately $8000 behind on her rent.

Pursuant to Florida Statues, the document states: “Failure of the tenant to pay the rent into the registry of the court or to file a motion to determine the amount of rent to be paid into the registry within 5 days […] after the date of service of process constitutes an absolute waiver of the tenant’s defenses other than payment, and the landlord is entitled to an immediate default judgement for removal of the tenant with a writ of possession to issue without further notice or hearing thereon.”
In other words, Azealia Banks has run out of options to continue to reside at the home.

Since the top of the year, Azealia Banks has made headlines for her criticism of everyone from Beyoncé to Doechii to Rihanna and A$AP Rocky.
Ice Spice was the latest artist to find herself in the “212” rapper’s crosshairs thanks to her Y2K aesthetic.

As part of her ongoing rollout for the upcoming album, the Bronx rap star took to Instagram on June 24, posting a seductive video of herself rapping along to her latest single “Phat Butt” while wearing a tight-fitting pink dress and long curly orange wig.
The clip evidently got under Banks’ skin as it prompted a vicious response from the “212” star over the stylistic nuances her of turn of the millennium-inspired album title.

Reposting the video on her Instagram Stories, Banks wrote: “Somebody needs to tell @icespice Absolutely nothing about this aesthetically, performance wise, production wise is Y2K at all…. This is like VIM early Nicki Minaj pack weave.
“We need a new hair color and a new facial expression. Ice I love you down but you should put the halt button, drop David lachapplle [sic] and re do this. Big butts and BBL bodies are the ANTITHESIS OF Y2K.”

The Harlem native then proceeded to post examples of the Y2K aesthetic, including photos of Jennifer Lopez and TLC.
She concluded her lecture by writing: “Baby phat, sidekicks were 2002 and on. ‘Y2K’ is 1997-2001.”
