Streaming Wars:
They chased Netflix and then they cut costs. Neither has worked.
Good afternoon from Las Vegas; I am here for The Netflix Slam, the streaming service’s latest live event. Netflix has tested live programming with stand-up, golf, reality TV, cooking and now tennis. It’s best to view these as experiments for more significant events to come, like weekly wrestling next year.
Despite traveling to Vegas twice in the last month, I still haven’t been to the Sphere, which is the hottest venue in live music. I am still waiting for them to book an act that appeals to fans under 50. That may not happen soon; Phish and Dead & Co. are next. While there are a few more announcements to come for later this year, it’s unlikely we will see a contemporary A-list star (like Beyoncé) until 2025.
