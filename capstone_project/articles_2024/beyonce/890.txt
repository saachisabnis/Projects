Alex Spiro, the attorney for JAY-Z and Beyoncé, has confirmed that he sent a letter to Piers Morgan asking him to remove his interview with Jaguar Wright. Spiro shared this news in an interview with TMZ on Wednesday. In that interview, Wright made several untrue claims about the couple, which Spiro called "demonstrably false." He stated, "There are rumors, and then there's nonsense, and this is beyond that." Spiro felt it was necessary to respond because the allegations were serious. He clarified that the letter was not a cease-and-desist but rather an ultimatum to take down the false claims or face court action. Morgan mentioned on his Uncensored show that JAY-Z and Beyoncé sent him a legal notice. He explained that Wright made several serious allegations during the interview, and since JAY-Z and Beyoncé couldn’t defend themselves at that time, their lawyers have now stepped in. Morgan emphasized that the claims were "totally false" and had no factual basis, leading them to edit those parts out of the original interview. He expressed that editing interviews is not something they do lightly, but legal concerns must be respected. He also offered an apology to JAY-Z and Beyoncé. Spiro stated that Wright's false claims hurt the voices of real victims.
