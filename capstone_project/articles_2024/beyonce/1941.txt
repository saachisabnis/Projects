Beyoncé has shared a message in support of her mother, Tina Knowles, who recently announced her new memoir, Matriarch.
Announcing the book via her socials, Tina Knowles wrote: "I have always been a storyteller, and it’s something I learned from my mother. When I had a family of my own, I believed that my daughters needed to know where they came from in order to know where they were going. I’m now ready to share my story with all of you, so that we can all celebrate these themes of strength, motherhood, Black pride, and identity."
She added that she chose to call the book Matriarch because, "what inspires me is the wisdom that women pass on to each other, generation to generation—and the inner wisdom we long to uncover in ourselves."

Sharing the book via her own socials, Beyoncé shared a heartfelt message in support of her mother. "Mama, I couldn’t be prouder. My love for you goes beyond what I can say," she wrote. "You put your heart into this book. I’m happy for you to share some of the stories that shaped you into who you are. To know you is to love you. But please don’t spill too much Mama Tea."
Matriarch is set for release on 22 April 2025, via Dialogue books, and is available to pre-order now.
