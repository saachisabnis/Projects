Ashlyn Harris is a former professional soccer player. Harris played club soccer with boys teams until the age of 14 before playing for the University of North Carolina and winning three NCAA Championships in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
Harris went on to play for the Saint Louis Athletica, Washington Freedom, Western New York Flash, Washington Spirit, Orlando Pride and NY/NJ Gotham FC. Harris was a member of the FIFA Women’s World Cup team in 2015 and 2019, and she was the alternate goalkeeper in the 2016 Olympics.
Harris and Ali Krieger crossed paths while playing for the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team and got engaged in September 2018. The pair tied the knot in 2019 after making their relationship public earlier that year. Harris and Krieger adopted daughter Sloane and son Ocean in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Us Weekly confirmed in October 2023 that Harris filed for divorce, while Krieger filed her own paperwork in December 2023.
Krieger insinuated that Harris cheated during their marriage by saying she was in her “Beyoncé ‘Lemonade’ era” in October 2023, one month after Harris filed for divorce. Harris denied the speculation, claiming she was “always faithful” in a November 2023 statement.
Harris has since moved on with Sophia Bush. The One Tree Hill alum confirmed their relationship in April 2024 after penning a personal essay for Glamour‘s cover story, where she came out as queer.
