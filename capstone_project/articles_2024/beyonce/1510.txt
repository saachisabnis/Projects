Levi’s shared an intriguing post on Instagram on Monday (September 23) that caught the attention of Beyoncé fans. The illustration featured in Levi’s post looks to be an image of Beyoncé riding a horse while sporting a cowboy hat, just like she is on the Cowboy Carter album cover. The iconic jeans brand captioned their post with this tease, “INTRODUCING: A New Chapter,” while also tagging Bey in the post. Levi’s also changed the bio on their account to read, “Let the countdown begin.” Beyoncé previously referenced the legendary brand with her Post Malone collaboration, “Levii’s Jeans,” that was featured on Cowboy Carter, which included Bey singing the tantalizing chorus, “Oh, you wish you were my Levi’s jeans.” Levi’s received a sales boost from the lyrical shout out, which prompted the company’s CFO, Harmit Singh, to sing her praises. “There’s no better person than [Beyoncé], who we call the center of culture,” Singh said in April.
