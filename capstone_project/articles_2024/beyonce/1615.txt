If you think Billie Eilish is a "nepo baby," think again — the star's mom is here to shut those comments down.
Eilish's mother, Maggie Baird, is featured in Glamour magazine for their Women of the Year Issue, alongside Beyoncé' & Solange Knowles' mom), Donna Kelce (Travis Kelce's mom) and Mandy Teefey (Selena Gomez's mom), and opened up about raising Billie and Finneas O'Connell. During the interview, Baird was asked about her appearance on Friends since the clip has resurfaced on the internet recently where she plays a casting director for Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc's character).
Maggie explained of the clip, "I think it’s hilarious. Because that came out, and it was like, 'Oh, Billie is a nepo baby.' And I’m like, 'Did you know that I got that episode of Friends because I was about to lose my health insurance?'
Baird went on to say, "My husband and I are working class actors. We eked out a meager living, and it afforded us a lot of time with our kids, which was awesome. But the industry is primarily people like us or even people not even like us who couldn't even do that. So when all of this happened to our kids, we'd never been on that side of it. I think that people don't really understand there's a whole industry of people who are creative and they're working and they're struggling, and they make perfectly happy lives, and they feel creative, and they feel fulfilled. But that's a very different life than on this side of the door where you’re suddenly playing in this different arena."
Baird has also appeared on shows including Curb Your Enthusiasm, Chicago Hope, Charmed, The West Wing and more.
