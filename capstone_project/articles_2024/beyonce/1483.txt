 Some people say that music is a universal love language. It has the ability to transcend cultures, borders, and belief systems, uniting individuals with perfectly crafted melodies and expertly worded lyrics. It's no surprise then, why music defines so many of the most important parts of a wedding, such as the reception entrance, the first dance, and the last dance. This also holds true for the moments before the ceremony begins, as the tunes played prior to the couple walking down the aisle can set the vibe for the whole day.

 Think about it: Most wedding guests (the good ones, at least) arrive about 10 to 15 minutes before the ceremony starts—and though you're not required to provide any entertainment for this period, it's not a bad idea to have some music—wedding prelude songs—playing to fill the time and get people excited. Tracks like "God Only Knows," by John Legend and Cynthia Erivo, "Everything," by Michael Bublé, and "Yellow," by Coldplay, for example, can set the mood for a romantic experience, while "Water Music Suite No.3, HWV 350," by George Frideric Handel, "Moonlight Sonata," by Beethoven, and "Sheep May Safely Graze," by Bach are lovely tunes to have live musicians play (which guests will absolutely love!). Whether played on a speaker or by a band or string quartet, these songs are sure to create the ambiance you and your partner desire.

 Generally, five or six songs are the right amount, so take a listen to 70 of our favorite wedding prelude songs and have fun making your selections.

Match your prelude music to the overall style of your wedding. For a rustic wedding in nature, contemporary acoustic songs make a great choice; for a traditional ceremony, pick mostly classical, instrumental music.

Both instrumental music and songs with lyrics can be used as wedding prelude music. A good rule of thumb is to choose songs that have a mellow presence and won't bring too much energy to the environment (that comes later!).
