BEL AIR, CA—Marking a stark pivot in her career, Beyoncé revealed the new cover Thursday for her forthcoming country album,  which features the pop star toothless and hunched over, sharing a jar of moonshine with her pet possum, Angus. “This iconic, generation-defining album cover proves Beyoncé is taking this departure into hillbilly music seriously,” music critic Hanna Pfeifer said of the Texas-born singer, whose highly anticipated Act II track list will include songs like “Dang Possum Stole My Moonshine” and “Possum, I’m Gon’ Kill You If You Don’t Get Back Here With My Moonshine This Got-Damn Minute.” “People criticizing the album artwork are completely dismissing Bey’s comprehensive and complex Texas roots. Many don’t even know that before Destiny’s Child, she was in a two-person jug band with her bucktoothed grandpappy, Earl Bob, in which she played a rusty washboard and slapped her knee. This is not some random new roadkill-skinning persona she’s putting on—it is absolutely genuine.” At press time, Beyoncé’s merch store had begun selling preorders for home-cooked meth.
