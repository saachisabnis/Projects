	“Sweet honey buckinnnn,” Meg wrote on her Instagram Stories, reposting Bey’s post and referencing one of the song titles. “Can’t wait to hear what that sounds like!”

	The superstar shared a graphic filled with what appears to be song titles from the March 29-slated record, modeled after a Western-style poster. “Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit,” reads a banner at the top.

	










	Alongside the names of previously released singles “16 Carriages” and the Billboard Hot 100-topping “Texas Hold ‘Em,” the post also features the following titles: “Ameriican Requiem,” “Blackbiird,” “Protector,” “My Rose,” “Bodyguard,” “Daughter,” “Spaghettii,” “Alliigator Tears,” “Smoke Hour II,” “Just for Fun,” “II Most Wanted,” “Levii’s Jeans,” “Flamenco,” “Ya Ya,” “Oh Louisiana,” “Desert Eagle,” “Riiverdance,” “Tyrant,” “II Hands II Heaven,” “Sweet Honey Buckin’” and “Amen.”

	Both artists were born in Texas and raised in Houston, and Meg has long looked up to the “Break My Soul” singer before they eventually collaborated for a Hot 100 chart-topping remix of Meg’s “Savage” in 2020. “Y’all don’t know how many times I cried this weekend,” Meg said in a TikTok in September, shortly after taking the stage with her hero. “Y’all don’t understand — Beyoncé is my idol, like I genuinely love Beyoncé with my whole f—ing heart.”
