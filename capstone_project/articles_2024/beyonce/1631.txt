A lot has changed since Paris last hosted the Olympics 100 years ago.
In 1924, a then-record 44 countries competed in the Games, which cost an estimated 10 million francs, according to "A Look At Olympic Costs" at The Olympic Studies Centre.
This year, 206 countries are sending athletes to go for gold, and the host nation will spend an estimated $8.2 billion on preparation.
From stadiums to security, here's a breakdown of some of the most eye-popping costs of staging and attending the 2024 Olympics in Paris, according to a new WalletHub report and Olympics data.
Paris is one of two cities to host the Summer Olympics three times; first in 1900, then 1924, and now 2024. (London has also hosted three times.)
WalletHub reported this year's estimated cost is $8.2 billion, although other outlets have estimated the total cost is as much as $10 billion. Still, that figure is actually less than other recent Summer Games. 
After adjusting the figures for inflation, MarketWatch reported in 2021 that Tokyo 2020 was the most expensive Summer Olympics, costing an estimated $20 billion, followed by London 2012 at $17.1 billion and Rio de Janeiro 2016 at $15.6 billion.
WalletHub estimates that $3.2 billion was spent on infrastructure, which includes the two new stadiums constructed for the Games: the Olympics Aquatics Centre and the Adidas Arena.
The Olympics Aquatics Centre cost $204 million to build, SwimSwam reported, and can hold 6,000 people. The venue will host diving, synchronized swimming, and some water polo events.
Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported the Adidas Arena cost $150 million to build and can host up to 9,000 spectators for badminton, rhythmic gymnastics, and weightlifting events.
In 2023, French newspaper Le Monde reported that the French government estimated the stadium was worth 647 million euros in 2021, which is about $705 million today.
Olympics.com reported that the country's largest stadium, The Stade de France, was originally constructed for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and has a capacity of 80,000 spectators.
Since then, it has been the home of several major sporting championships, such as the 2016 Euros and the 2007 and 2023 Rugby World Cups, and concerts by major artists like Beyoncé and Céline Dion.
Now, the stadium is prepared to host track-and-field events and rugby sevens matches, as well as the closing ceremony on August 11.
In 2014, NBCU announced that the International Olympic Committee awarded the network broadcast rights "across all media platforms" from 2021 to 2032 in a deal worth $7.65 billion.
The network has held exclusive broadcast rights for the Summer Olympics since 1988, NBCU reported.
This year, NBC has tapped pop-culture figures like Kelly Clarkson, Alex Cooper, and Snoop Dogg for additional Olympics coverage.
According to WalletHub, the network has already made upwards of $1.2 billion from domestic ad sales for the Olympics.
The outdoor ceremony is the first of its kind, with boats for each national delegation riding down the Seine to kick off the Games.
Per Olympics.com, admission is actually free for many spectators, as people can access "the upper quays" without tickets. Lower quays, however, from the Austerlitz Bridge to the Iéna Bridge will require tickets. Tickets start at 90 euros and reach 2,700 euros, according to the Olympics' ticket-cost guide.
The river is also famously the focus of the city's $1.5 billion clean-up project, completed for both the opening ceremony and to host three open-air swimming events.
Almost half of tickets reserved for the general public are priced at 50 euros or less, with more than a million tickets being sold for 24 euros, or about $26, according to Olympics.com.
The most expensive single tickets are listed for 980 euros, or $1,068, per the Olympics.
WalletHub reported that more than 100 AI-equipped smart cameras will be present in the city.
The IOC also announced in May that Paris 2024 will be the first Olympic and Paralympic Games to use an AI-powered monitoring service to "protect athletes and officials from online abuse."
