There were a few surprises during the first weekend, with Latin and pop music sensation Shakira taking to the stage for at least two sets.
The event also celebrated a reunion of the 1990s band No Doubt, which hadn’t performed as an ensemble in nine years. Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont and Adrian Young played for a little over an hour, performing standards such as “Just a girl,” “Don’t Speak” and “Spiderwebs.” At one point, No Doubt was joined by unscheduled guest Olivia Rodrigo for a performance of the band’s 2000 song “Bathwater.”
Preparations for traffic connected with the event started last month.
Avenue 50, between Monroe Street and Madison Avenue, has been closed since March 25 and will remain so until May 6 for the dual-weekend entertainment and extensive post-fest cleanups.
According to Indio’s traffic plan, there will be no pedestrian access on Monroe, between Avenue 49 and Avenue 52, nor along Madison, between Avenues 50 and 52.
Police cautioned travel delays will be heavy along Washington Street between Interstate 10 and Avenue 52, as well as Jefferson Street and avenues 48 and 50 going into the Empire Polo Club grounds.
Along with Indio police, other law enforcement agencies are providing support throughout the event, including the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department and California Highway Patrol.
Festival information, including the entire list of musical acts, can be found at coachella.com/lineup.
YouTube has aired livestreams of the event.
