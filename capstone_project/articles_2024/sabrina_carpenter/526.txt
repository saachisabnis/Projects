We all know how quickly our trolleys can fill up at a supermarket with everything we need - and how much it burns our pockets.
But one woman cannot get over how expensive the food is at the world's most luxurious supermarket.
Whether its a spa day, going out for drinks or coffee, or buying an item you have been admiring for a while, we all like to treat ourselves every now and then. Some people like treat themselves to luxurious food shop - Brits opt for M&S or Waitrose - and in the US Erewhon is the spot for fancy food.
There are a number of the supermarkets around the California area and they are known for being celebrity hotspots.
People have been rushing to get the "world's most famous" viral smoothies - created by Sophia Richie Grange, Hailey Bieber, Kourtney Kardashian, Sabrina Carpenter, and more.
One woman, who is obsessed with thrifting and finding good deals, decided to check out the luxury food store. She could not believe the price for a box of berries.
Vanessa, who shared her experience at Erewhon on her TikTok page @vanessaleen, played a game with her friend while shopping. She asked her pal to guess the price of a mixed berries box at the organic supermarket.
Her friend guessed a box is priced at $19.20 [$14.65] and Vanessa guessed $24 [18.32]. She could not believe that the box of strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries is a whopping $41.18 [£31.42].
In a series of other videos, Vanessa shared that other fruit items will also leave you with an expensive bill. A box of pomegranate seeds is $34 [£25.95] and watermelon fans will have to fork out $26.12 [£19.93] for a box of the fruit chunks. Plus a tub of dragon fruit costs $29.30 [£22.36].
She hared that a box of cucumbers will set you back $27.19 [£20.75] , while a box of organic potatoes with rosemary costs $25.72 [£19.63]. For those who prefer sweet potato, you will have to fork out $24.03 [£18.34]. Green beans are priced at $25.01 [£19.08].
Vanessa also found a turkey breast for a whopping $75 [£57.24], while one piece of salmon is priced at $16.40 [£12.51]. For four boiled eggs you will pay $10 [£7.63].
