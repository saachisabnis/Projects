The juiciest celebrity memoirs and biographies always come out in the fall and winter — and 2024 is no exception.
This season, many of the biggest releases are centered around musicians. Cher, for example, is dropping her long-awaited autobiography, which will be divided into two parts. (The second part is expected to hit shelves in late 2025.)
When the memoir was announced in July, Cher’s publisher described her life as “too immense” for just one book. “With her trademark honesty and humor, Cher: The Memoir traces how this diamond in the rough succeeded with no plan and little confidence to become the trailblazing superstar the world has been unable to ignore for more than half a century,” HarperCollins wrote in a statement announcing the project.
Cher’s memoir, however, is just one of many new music books hitting shelves this fall and winter. Keep scrolling for a full list:
