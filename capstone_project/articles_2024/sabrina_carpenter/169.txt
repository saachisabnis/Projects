Olivia Rodrigo revealed she celebrated turning 21 by going out to buy cigarettes and beer.Â 
The Vampire singer, who had her milestone birthday on Tuesday, shared the anecdote during the opening night of her Guts World Tour in Palm Springs on Friday.
'I went to the gas station the other day and bought a pack of cigarettes and a six pack of beer,' she said during her show, part of which was shared via fan on TikTok.
However, the hitmaker added that she didn't 'consume' her purchases: 'I promise I didn't consume it, but I just bought it because I f*****g could.'Â 
The star then reassured her fans that growing up was not scary: 'Anyway, all this to say that I think growing up isnâ€™t so scary after all and life just kind of gets better at the end.'

She went on to perform a number of her other hits, including 'Sour' and 'traitor.'
Throughout the show she sizzled in a number of different costumes, including a white crop top with the phrase 'Just a girl' and shimmering silver micro shorts.
On Tuesday, the songstress repped her half-Filipino heritage wearing a Philippines T-shirt while enjoying a slice of cake at her balloon-filled birthday celebration.
The self-described 'Spicy Pisces' - who boasts 70.1M social media followers - captioned her post: '21! So grateful for all of the incredible things I've been able to experience so far and so excited for all the good times ahead! Thx 4 all the love!'

Rodrigo put on quite a sideshow at the party while scantily clad in a panty-flashing, halter-neck LBD and matching heels.

Olivia made sure to invite her BFFs - Unstable actress Iris Apatow and The Brothers Sun actress Madison Hu - who both appeared in her music videos for Bad Idea Right and SOUR Prom.
Rodrigo's other party guests included Conan Gray, Tate McRae, Laroi, and FINNEAS.
The Cali-born pop star - who's soon releasing a limited-edition cookie with Crumbl - snacked on a cookie emblazoned with a pictured of herself as a child.
Curiously missing from the festivities was Olivia's alleged boyfriend since October - Argylle actor Louis Partridge - who posted two Instagram snaps of himself enjoying Disneyland on Monday.
And while the 20-year-old Englishman didn't share snaps of Rodrigo, she definitely enjoyed the 'happiest place on Earth' alongside Conan, Madison, and Iris on Monday.
