Sabrina Carpenter's appearance at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards was out of this world, wowing the crowd with a cosmic performance that even included a smooch with an alien.
Introduced by '80s pop icon Cyndi Lauper, Carpenter was slowly lowered to the stage on a swing as she sang "Please Please Please" among a galaxy-like sky, expertly moving into her latest single "Taste," from her new album Short n' Sweet. The space theme continued as she was joined by an astronaut and baby blue alien, dancing along before the singer turned around and gave the alien a kiss.

The Disney Channel alum was then joined by dozens more men dressed as astronauts as she launched into a rendition of "Espresso," the catchy track that ended up earning Carpenter her very first VMA trophy for Song of the Year, beating tracks from artists like Taylor Swift and Beyonc√©. She recently revealed why she called the award-winning song a "manifestation tactic" and shared some insight into the history behind the track.
