Alex Scott looked almost unrecognisable as she attended Vogue World during Paris Fashion Week on Sunday evening. 
The sports presenter, 39, is usually seen with shorter brunette hair that is often pulled back into a sleek bun, but she switched it up for the event. 
Alex wore a long, black blazer dress that featured structured shoulders and three belts, across her chest, waist and hips. 
Putting on an edgy display, she teamed her new hairstyle with lightened eyebrows and a heavily contoured makeup look. 
To complete her outfit, the former professional footballer elevated her height with a pair of pointed toe stilettos.

A cohort of famous faces are taking part in the Vogue World event, celebrating 100 years of fashion and sport in the iconic city. 
Guests include Gigi Hadid, Ciara, Maluma, Sabrina Carpenter, Kendall Jenner, Serena and Venus Williams and Aya Nakumura.
The venue for the show is the famed Place Vendôme - a square which is a renowned location for fine jewellery and the inspiration for a Catherine Deneuve film.
Last year the event was hosted in London, while the year before the Big Apple was the backdrop for the high fashion extravaganza. 
Those who were unable to get a ticket for the event will be able to watch the action unfold on a live stream, which will be hosted by Cara Delevingne.
This year's Vogue World collaborated with youth athletic academies across France, pairing different sports with a history of 100 years of French fashion.
The sports include cycling, gymnastics, tennis, fencing, and break dancing, among others and the fashion will shine a spotlight on both modern and historic designers.
Artists who are expected to perform during the show include Bad Bunny and Aya Nakamura, although little detail has been revealed so far.

Speaking on the event, Vogue's global editorial director and Condé Nast chief content officer Anna Wintour, said: 'If Vogue World: New York was a street fair, and Vogue World: London was a glamorous night at the theatre...
'Supporting arts and cultural organisations in London – Paris will be a kind of opening ceremony; one that celebrates 100 years of fashion and sport, as well as this extraordinary city.'
A percentage of the net proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to the humanitarian organisation Secours Populaire. 
The organisation facilitates access to essential equipment for young, aspiring athletes across France.
