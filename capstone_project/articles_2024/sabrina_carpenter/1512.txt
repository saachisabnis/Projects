Chappell Roan spoke to Sabrina Carpenter about their experiences of fame

The 26-year-old star and Sabrina, 25, have both enjoyed a meteoric rise over recent years, and Chappell has revealed that they recently met to discuss their personal experiences of fame and success.

She told Rolling Stone magazine: "We’re both going through something so f****** hard … she just feels like everything is flying, and she’s just barely hanging on. It was just good to know someone else feels that way."

Chappell has been making music for years, but she's only recently become a global star.

The singer actually finds it frustrating that fans are only now becoming aware of her music.

Chappell - who released her debut EP, 'School Nights', back in 2017 - said: "What’s so infuriating is how people are just now taking me seriously. Like, ‘You know what, b****? I’ve been doing this s*** and you’re just now catching up.’"

Chappell actually released a series of songs as an independent artist before signing with a major label.

And she's now confessed to putting labels "through hell" before she made a decision about her long-term future.

The 'Good Luck, Babe!' hitmaker - whose real name is Kayleigh Amstutz - shared: "I put the labels through hell. Hell. 

"I was like, ‘Give me a [pitch] deck on how you would market me. Give me a deck on what you would do with my career. What do you see in five years? If you can’t even do it in a hypothetical situation, you don’t know how to figure it out. I’m definitely not signing to your a**.'"
