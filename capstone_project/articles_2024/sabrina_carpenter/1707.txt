About
ATEEZ’s new album, GOLDEN HOUR: Part.2, debuts atop the Billboard 200, giving the K-pop boy band their second No. 1 record of their career and their sixth consecutive Top 10 release. Other strong debuts dominated the top of the charts this week, as Linkin Park’s From Zero premieres at No. 2, Jin’s solo debut album, Happy, enters at No. 3, and Rauw Alejandro’s Cosa Nuestra arrives at No. 6. ENHYPEN’s ROMANCE: UNTOLD jumps up to No. 7 following a reissue with two bonus tracks, after debuting at No. 2 in July. This marks the first time in Billboard 200 chart history that there are three K-pop albums in the Top 10. 
Elsewhere in the Top 10, Tyler, The Creator’s CHROMAKOPIA drops three spots to No.4, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet dips two places to No.5, Gracie Abrams’ The Secret of Us drops four spots to No.8, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft slides down four slots to No. 9, and Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess falls four places to No.10.
