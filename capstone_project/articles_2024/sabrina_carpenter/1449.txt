Sabrina Carpenter set her new Netflix Christmas special in motion on Thursday (December 5) night, just two days after news of her breakup with Barry Keoghan surfaced. 
According to Page Six, the "Espresso" songstress was all smiles during an intimate screening of "A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter" in New York City less than 48 hours after rumors the Saltburn actor cheated on her came to light. 
The star donned a vintage Chanel fur dress complete with matching pumps as she waved to fans and posed for photos outside the Paris Theater. 
Carpenter, 25, and Keoghan, 32, dated for one year before calling it quits earlier this week. A source told People that the pair are simply too focused on their career to maintain a relationship at this time. 
"They are both young and career-focused, so they've decided to take a break."
The former couple sparked romance rumors in December 2023 and Carpenter hard launched their relationship with the June 2024 release of her "Please Please Please" music video starring the actor. By August, rumors of a split began to swirl, but were never confirmed as the now exes continued to support each other publicly with Keoghan attending a handful of Carpenter's Short N' Sweet Tour shows, and the "Bed Chem" star praising Keoghan's acting skills.
