From Scream Queen to Pop Princess! Emma Roberts, who’s a huge Britney Spears fan, has made it known she wants to play the singer in the upcoming biopic.
“Emma’s been a fan since she was a little girl and says she’s been preparing for this role her entire life,” a source exclusively tells Life & Style “Everyone in Hollywood from Millie Bobby Brown to Sabrina Carpenter has expressed interest in playing the role, but Emma is hell-bent on landing it.”
The actress, 33, has even enlisted the help of her famous aunt, Julia Roberts, 56. “Julia would love to see her niece get the part, and apparently she’s prepared to help. She has a lot of pull in this town, so she could influence the decision.”
