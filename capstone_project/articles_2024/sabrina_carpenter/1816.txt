Taylor Swift once again surprised everyone by bringing out an unexpected guest during her mega popular Eras Tour. During the acoustic portion of the set where the 14-time Grammy winner performs different songs each night, Swift welcomed pop star Sabrina Carpenter to the stage.
The bubbly singer opened for the Eras Tour in Melbourne, Sydney and Singapore to start 2024, and is currently on her own Short n' Sweet Tour. On stage, the duo performed a mashup of Carpenter's "Espresso" and "Please Please Please" with Swift's "Now That We Don't Talk."
"Espresso" took the world by storm this summer, with the line "I'm working late, cause I'm a singer" seemingly being heard everywhere. Swift was clearly not immune to the pure joy those seven words can muster. When they got to that portion of the song, Swift excitedly asked her singing partner, "Can I do it?"
When permission was given, a giddy "oh my god, I'm about to do it" followed before flawlessly delivering the lyric.
Taylor Swift, she's just like us with "Espresso."
