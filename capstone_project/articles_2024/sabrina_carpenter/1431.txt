A new feature announced by Instagram today will allow users to add a song on their profile — much like Myspace in the early 2000s.
The music added to a user’s profile shows up in the bio area, according to screenshots shared by Instagram. A song will be featured on a profile until the user removes or replaces it. But unlike Myspace, songs won’t autoplay — people viewing a profile with a song can play and pause the track.
Users can add a song by going to the “edit profile” page, where they’ll be able to search for and select a track from Instagram’s library of licensed music that’s also available for things like Reels or posts. From there, users will be able to select a 30-second-long portion of the song to add.
Instagram is launching the feature in collaboration with pop star Sabrina Carpenter, whose earworm hit “Espresso” has been inescapable this summer. Beginning today, Carpenter’s official Instagram profile will include a teaser of a never-before-heard song, “Taste,” ahead of her album release on Friday. Instagram says the profile music feature is the only way to hear the song ahead of the full release.
Instagram is also adding a few hidden features themed around Carpenter’s upcoming album, Short n’ Sweet. Using certain keywords like “Sabrina” or the coffee cup emoji will turn temporary Notes messages light blue, and there’s a Carpenter-branded chat theme featuring lipstick kisses.
