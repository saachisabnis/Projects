	In a new interview with Vanity Fair, Carpenter revealed that she did not warn her boyfriend of the outro before she performed it. “Oh my gosh, no,” she said. “Maybe I should do that. I guess it’s a little too late now.”

	Keoghan and the Girl Meets World alum first sparked dating rumors at the beginning of this year. At a recent Taylor Swift concert in Singapore, fans spotted Carpenter running into the actor’s arms after finishing her opening set, wrapping him in a tight hug.

	In March, Carpenter and Keoghan made their public debut at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. While the duo didn’t pose side-by-side on the red carpet, they did walk it at the same time, occasionally sneaking looks at each other. At one point during the party, the pair snapped a photo together off the carpet, covering the bottoms of their faces with their hands.

	Most recently, Keoghan starred in Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” music video as the duo portray a Bonnie and Clyde-type couple navigating their love through crime and jail stints. Following the release of the clip, the pop star became the only person the actor follows on Instagram.
