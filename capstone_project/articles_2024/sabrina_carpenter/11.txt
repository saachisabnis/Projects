Ariana Grande brought Sabrina Carpenter into the "Saturday Night Live" mix during a hilarious sketch featuring a group of bridesmaids giving their toast to the bride at a wedding reception, set to Carpenter's hit "Espresso" â€” and Sabrina shared her reaction to the funny bit.
During the sketch, titled "Bridesmaid Speech," Ariana Grande is Maid of Honor for her sister ("same mom, different dads!"), and invites the rest of the bridesmaids up to give a toast to bride Kelsey as they sing a song about their bachelorette trip to Charleston, South Carolina. Because as Grande proclaims, "They say what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas," adding another bridesmaid, "But, we didn't go to Vegas. We went to Charleston, hit it!"
The group then sings to the tune of "Espresso" (because Espresso Martini's are Kelsey's favorite) about their not-so-innocent trip to Charleston, and their encounter with Domingo, who is "actually a doctor, and randomly a model. And he volunteers with weird sick animals."
Following the sketch's debut on SNL, Sabrina shared the video on her Instagram stories, writing, "Very nice and on pitch." Ariana then replied to Carpenter's comment, writing, "tysm we tried."
