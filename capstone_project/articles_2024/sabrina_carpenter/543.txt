Say it with flowers, but only if those flowers are also holding cigs. Rosalía attended Charli XCX’s 32nd birthday in Los Angeles Saturday night, and she did not show up empty-handed. The Motomami was papped on Hyperion Ave. carrying a bouquet of black calla lilies with the spadices (the yellow things in the center of a calla) replaced with cigarettes. Calla lilies are traditionally a funeral flower, so adding a few carcinogens to the arrangement kind of makes sense. They were blue Parliaments, btw.
Charli XCX is capping off Brat summer with her bday. According to People, other attendees included Lorde, Sabrina Carpenter, Glen Powell, and Anya Taylor-Joy. As an August Leo, Charli allegedly balances her desire for attention and creative endeavors with more intellectual pursuits and “an additional level of maturity” (per Horoscope dot com).
