The lineup of performers at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards just got even more stacked. Blackpink’s Lisa, Halsey, Benson Boone, and Lenny Kravitz have all been added to the music lineup at this year’s awards ceremony, joining the previously-announced list of performers featuring Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, GloRilla, Camila Cabello, and Rauw Alejandro. MTV’s 2024 VMAs will be broadcast live on Wednesday, September 11th at 8 p.m. ET/PT from New York’s UBS Arena. 
Boone is a VMA newcomer who currently has one of the biggest singles of the year, “Beautiful Things,” from his breakout debut album, Fireworks and Rollerblades. Halsey will be performing one of her new singles when she makes her long-awaited return to the VMAs stage, while Lisa will make her solo debut on MTV’s main stage riding the momentum of her hit single “Rockstar” and her hot new collaboration with Rosalía, “New Woman.” Kravitz’s performance will mark the rock legend’s triumphant return to the VMA stage for the first time in over 25 years.
