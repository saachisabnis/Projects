Much to parse through here. 😅
Barry Keoghan is single following his increasingly dramatic breakup with Sabrina Carpenter, and if you're feeling vaguely curious and nosy about his dating history for, um, reasons, very much same! Here's everyone Barry's dated over the years (at least that we know of) starting with....
Barry started dating Shona as things were ~escalating~ in his career, and she joined him on multiple red carpets throughout their relationship. Just gonna leave these here:
Shona and Barry were pretty open about their relationship, and she even confirmed that they met in a pub on Good Friday. "I was working in the pub at the time and he was actually there with another girl, which is a debate we have quite a lot, because I wasn't aware and then I was aware and it was too late," she said. "But yeah, he just wouldn't take no for an answer and now I'm still stuck with him!"
Meanwhile, Barry gushed “I’d be lost without her, I’m telling you that. I wouldn’t be the man I am now without her. With this game, rejection comes as well and that can be hard. Flying away, almost getting a part and then losing it. It’s draining. I’d be down on myself, and she’d pick me right up and remind me what I’m doing. She’s made me a man.”
Fans started speculating about their breakup in 2020, when they unfollowed each other on Instagram.
Alyson and Barry started dating in February 2021, after they met in...you guessed it...a pub. Barry told GQ that Alyson "didn't care" that he was an actor, and she added “He was saying he plays a superhero in a film. I went, ‘Who, Spider-Man?’”
The couple welcomed a baby boy in 2022 and moved to Scotland, but then news of their split hit in  in January 2024—when a source told The Sun, "They’ve grown apart over recent months and things have finally come to a head."
The pair seem to coparent well together, though, and this year Barry told GQ that Alyson has “done a great job, and she’s an incredible mother.”
Barry and Sabrina dated for almost exactly a year, and were first seen together in December of 2023.
Their relationship escalated pretty quickly, by which I mean these two were photographed at events, Barry could. not. stop. leaving thirsty comments on Sabrina's posts, they attended the Met Gala, AND Barry starred in the music video for Sabrina's song "Please Please Please."
In other words, everything was going well. But then Barry and Sabrina went on a "break" in early December, amid false cheating rumors that lead to Barry experiencing a lot of bullying online. To the point where he dropped a statement (fwiw he didn't mention Sabrina or the rumors explicitly) saying “I can only sit and take so much. My name has been dragged across the internet in ways I usually don’t respond to. I have to respond now because it’s gettin to a place where there are too many lines being crossed. I deactivated my account because I can no longer let this stuff distract from my family and my work. The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent and every other inhumane thing you can imagine.”
He added, “Each and every day I work harder to push myself on every level to be the healthiest and strongest person for that boy. I want to provide opportunities for him to learn, fail and grow. I want him to be able to look up to his daddy, to have full trust in me and know I will have his back no matter what. I need you to remember he has to read ALL of this about his father when he is older. Please be respectful to all. Thank u x.”
Meanwhile, a source told  Us Weekly that “It’s been challenging for their relationship since she started going on tour and has been gone a lot. Their schedules were not aligning. All the time spent apart it was hard to maintain a relationship amid her career exploding.”
They also made sure to inform everyone that Barry was “very faithful and loyal” to Sabrina and also “very devoted to her happiness.”
Welp that brings us up to date. As you were!
