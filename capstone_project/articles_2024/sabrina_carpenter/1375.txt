Sometimes, you just need to let loose at a Sabrina Carpenter concert with your girlfriends! Even if that girlfriend is just your 47-year-old male co-star. Selena Gomez did just that at the New York concert date for Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet tour, which SelGo attended with Édgar Ramírez and model Connar Franklin and not her boyfriend, Benny Blanco. In Blanco’s apparent absence, a video of her dancing up on a different man went viral — her Emilia Pérez co-star Ramírez.
