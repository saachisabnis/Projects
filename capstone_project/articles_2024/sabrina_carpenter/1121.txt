So, about those theories that Sabrina asked Tay for "permission"...ðŸ‘€
Remember when Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims casually dropped a campaign with Sabrina Carpenter and the internet spiraled due to the musician's close friendship with Taylor Swift? Like, spiraled to the point where people were speculating that Sabrina had asked Tay for "permission" to do the campaign? About that...ðŸ‘€
During a convo with Variety about Tay (who she called a "rock star"), Sabrina said, "The posts about me having to â€˜ask for her permissionâ€™â€”no. Sheâ€™s one of my best, best friends, and we grab dinner or text and catch up like you would with your best friend."
This echoes comments the celeb previously made to Rolling Stone about the Skims campaign. Ahem: "In that scenario, Iâ€™ve been very, very communicative with [Taylor] about that situation, and I just love her so much and support her till the end." "So it was no weirdness for me, but I know people will just say things because thatâ€™s all they have time to do," the "Espresso" singer added. 
Oh, and Sabrina *also* told Variety the following about getting advice from Taylor: "Itâ€™s so cool for me to get a perspective on this whole process from her and the community of artists that I feel Iâ€™m close toâ€”to get advice from them on stuff that you canâ€™t just ask the internet. Weâ€™re always playing each other our [music], and whenever I start to think, 'Maybe Iâ€™ll get on Twitter and say something about this,' Iâ€™m always like, 'Maybe Iâ€™ll write a song instead.'"
Obsessed with their friendship!
