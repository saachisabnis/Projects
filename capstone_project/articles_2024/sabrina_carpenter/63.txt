	Each night on her Short n’ Sweet Tour, Sabrina Carpenter arrests an audience member for being too hot. Last night in Atlanta that audience member was none other than Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. 

	During the show, as usual, Carpenter announced that she saw “this gorgeous girl” in the crowd. “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up,” the singer said. “This girl is so hot.” She then pretended not to know who Brown was, forcing the actress to scream “Millie!” at the stage. 

	“Millie, I’ve never fallen in love at a concert before, but stranger things have happened,” Carpenter replied. “It’s so unfortunate we have to arrest you because you’re so beautiful. That sucks.” She handed Brown a pair of furry handcuffs after Brown insisted, “Please arrest me.”

The stranger things reference was so good 🤣 #sabrinacarpenter #milliebobbybrown #shortnsweettour #strangerthings #shortnsweet #sabrinacarpentermusic #concert

	The singer recently appeared on the cover of TIME and spoke about the perception of female pop stars. She also responded to fans who were scandalized to learn that her family witnessed her flaunting her sexuality while onstage at Madison Square Garden on her tour. “My fans online are like, I can’t believe she’s bending over in front of her grandparents!” Carpenter said. “I’m like, girl, they are not paying attention to that. They’re just like, I can’t believe all these people are here.”

	










	She added, “You’ll still get the occasional mother that has a strong opinion on how you should be dressing. And to that I just say, don’t come to the show and that’s OK. It’s unfortunate that it’s ever been something to criticize, because truthfully, the scariest thing in the world is getting up on a stage in front of that many people and having to perform as if it’s nothing. If the one thing that helps you do that is the way you feel comfortable dressing, then that’s what you’ve got to do.”
