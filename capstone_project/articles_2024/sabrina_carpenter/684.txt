Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is spending its eighth nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, adding to its leading total of most weeks topping the singles charts in 2024. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” also continues to sit atop the Hot Country Songs chart for its 12th week at No. 1. The rest of the Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart is dominated by Sabrina Carpenter, who also holds the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart with Short n’ Sweet. Carpenter’s brand new single, “Taste,” debuts at No. 2 this week, while her previous No. 1 single, “Please Please Please,” jumps up six spots to No. 3, and “Espresso”  climbs three spots to No. 4, approaching its previous chart high of No. 3. Carpenter becomes only the second act ever to have her first three Top 5 hits reach the charts simultaneously, joining only the Beatles who accomplished the feat in 1964. Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, rounds out the Billboard 200 Top 5, dropping three spots to No. 5. (Billboard)
