Sabrina Carpenter got into the Halloween spirit in a major way during her Short n’ Sweet tour stop in Dallas on Wednesday (October 31). The pop superstar donned three different costumes for the spooky occasion, even singing Olivia Newton-John’s lovelorn ballad, “Hopelessly Devoted To You,” while dressed as John’s character Sandy Olsson from the beloved 1978 film, Grease. Carpenter previously covered John’s Oscar-nominated song several times during her stint as the opener on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. Grease was the top-grossing film of 1978, and the film soundtrack spent 12 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually receiving a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. During the rest of her Dallas performance, Carpenter also dressed up as a Playboy bunny at one point in her set, as well as the magical Tinker Bell from the story of Peter Pan, the legendary boy who wouldn’t grow up.
