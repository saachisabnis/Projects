It’s all love between Shawn Mendes and ex-girlfriend Camila Cabello.
The “Señorita” collaborators remain on good terms after calling it quits for a second time last year, Mendes, 26, told The New York Times in an interview published on Thursday, October 31.
The “Why Why Why” crooner opened up about his relationship with Cabello, 27, telling the outlet that they still talk about music and other important topics, and it “bugs me” that people think they are “against each other in a weird way.”
“I have nerves just even speaking about it, just what people would say. But honestly, if something was to happen in my family and if something was to happen to me, she’d probably be the first person I call, to this day,” Mendes said.
He added, “Our relationship is teaching me what love means, in a big way.”
The musicians began dating in 2019 around the time of the release of their steamy song, “Señorita,” but ended their relationship two years later. “Hey guys, we’ve decided to end our romantic relationship but our love for one another as humans is stronger than ever,” the pair wrote in a joint statement shared to their respective Instagram Stories in November 2021. “We started our relationship as best friends and will continue to be best friends. We so appreciate your support from the beginning and moving forward. Camila and Shawn.”
Mendes and Cabello ignited reunion rumors after they were spotted getting cozy at Coachella in April 2023, but they split again in June last year.
“Camila was the one who ultimately decided to end things,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.
The singers weren’t able to put their past behind them while giving their relationship a second chance, a source said. “A lot of their old problems started coming back after spending so much time together,” the insider told Us.

According to a second source, the twosome were initially “excited at the possibility” of getting back together. “It felt really nostalgic and all those initial feelings they had for each other when they first started dating came flooding back … but after a few months, they remembered why they split in the first place,” the insider said.
On Monday, October 28, Mendes addressed persistent speculation about his sexuality during an intimate performance of his new album, Shawn, in Colorado.
“The real truth about my life and my sexuality is, man, I’m just figuring it out like everyone. I don’t really know sometimes and I know other times,” the “Stitches” singer said. “It feels really scary because we live in a society that has a lot to say about that. I’m trying to be really brave and just allow myself to just be human and feel things. That’s all I wanna say about that for now.”
