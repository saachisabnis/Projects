Thanks to the Maryam Nassir Zadeh x J.Crew collaboration, we can expect to see lots of periwinkle this upcoming New York Fashion Week; the hue plays a starring role in the collection. But it’s not only fashion fans that are besotted with this cool-toned pastel shade—Sabrina Carpenter has also been known to favor it, most recently at the 2024 Met Gala. And over in the beauty world, one of the latest beauty products causing a stir on TikTok is the Prada Moisturizing Lip Balm in a color called Astral Pink, which appears to be a periwinkle blue bullet but magically changes to pink on your lips, adapting to their pH levels. Scroll through to see how street styles are incorporating this color into their wardrobes.
