Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan have "decided to take a break" after a year of dating, news that was officially confirmed by sources yesterday, December 3. So....why did they split up?
According to People, it has everything to do with their busy schedules. As an insider put it, "They are both young and career-focused, so they've decided to take a break."
Mmmkay!
Barry and Sabrina started dating back in December 2023, and went public pretty fast—by which I mean Barry straight up starred in Sabrina's "Please Please Please" video and they made multiple appearances together—including at the Met Gala back in May.
Barry even gushed about Sabrina as recently as early November, saying he was thrilled about her Grammy nominations. Direct quote: “I’m really, really happy for her, honestly, and I got to get on the phone soon...I don't know anyone who works as hard. I'm in awe watching her work and how committed and the standards that she sets. Especially being on that music video, just, she knows the vision. She knows what she wants.”
Oh, and earlier that same month he talked about her on another podcast, gushing “Listen, all I’m going to say is I’m incredibly blessed. Such a strong, independent lady who’s massively talented and yeah. Pretty special.”
I mean...very cute. So on that note, secretly manifesting these two getting back together.
