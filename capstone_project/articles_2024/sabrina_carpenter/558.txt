Taking the underwear as outerwear trend *very* literally
All eyes are on the beautiful and supremely talented Sabrina Carpenter at the moment, and not just because of all *those* Barry Keoghan rumours, either... Nope, what we're more interested in here on the Cosmo fashion desk is, ofc, her style â€“ though we are living for the updates about this rumoured new romance too, obviously. But back to the clothes! The 24-year-old singer and actor has long been delighting her 32 million (!!) Instagram followers with 'fit after epic 'fit, and people are fully obsessed. It's unsurprising, really, given her penchant for rocking ultra-girly, super-glitzy and teeny tiny ensembles on the reg.
So you can only imagine the sheer frenzy that unfolded when Sabrina dropped a carousel of pics on her Insta a few hours ago, one of which showed her going big on the underwear as outerwear trend...
Yep, while the rest of us are out here bravely battling our way through the ice-cold January temperatures in all the puffers, thermals and jumpers we can fit on our bods, Sabrina is casually leaving the house in little more than her undies and a coat. Quite literally, though: the star wore an oversized grey tailored maxi coat with a see-through black bra, glittery gold boxers-slash-micro-shorts, black over-the-knee boots and that's it! 
Is it just us, or is it giving high-fashion flasher chic? We're kinda obsessed with the fact that she went all in with the naked dressing trend, and took the whole "underwear as outerwear" thing so much more literally than most celebs. Well, tbqh, if we looked like that, we'd probably do the same too.
