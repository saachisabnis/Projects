Sabrina Carpenter will perform at the American Airlines Center in Dallas tomorrow night (Wednesday, October 30th) with her Short N Sweet Tour in front of thousands of screaming fans. While she's jumping from city to city in Texas, she's having some fun along the way.
This past weekend Sabrina made a surprise appearance at a Taylor Swift Era's Tour show in New Orleans and then performed in front of a sold-out crowd at Houston's Toyota Center. After performing in Austin and making her way north to Dallas, she and her crew made a pitstop at a Texas iconic travel stop, Buc-ee's.
Sabrina left behind her bejeweled stage corsets and opted for an oversized black zip-up sweater, brown t-shirt, and a pink trucker hat hoping to blend in with the general population. It seemed to work, but it also helped that it was the middle of the night.
While we know Buc-ee's for hundreds of gas pumps, BBQ sandwiches, candied nuts, large inexpensive fountain drinks, and the cleanest restrooms along the interstate, Buc-ee's also sells all kinds of home goods, t-shirts, souvenirs, and more.
Sabrina and her entourage discovered that Buc-ee's has a lot of messages on their products. From kitchen towels, wall decor, a book of El Arroyo sign quotes, makeup bags and lazy Susan's there are quotes everywhere. She and the gang had some fun with the quotes and posted them on TikTok.

While she's on the road there's no doubt that she and her entourage will not run across a travel stop like a Texas Buc-ee's!
