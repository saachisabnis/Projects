Sabrina Carpenter thinks Taylor Swift belongs in a "different echelon" to herself.
Sabrina Carpenter has heaped praise on Taylor Swift
The 25-year-old singer opened for Taylor on her Eras Tour earlier this year, but Sabrina acknowledged that her career doesn't really compare to what Taylor has already achieved.
The blonde beauty told Rolling Stone magazine: "I could never compare my life, my career, my trajectory to anything close to what she’s done."
Sabrina and Taylor, 34, have become friends over the years. And the 'Blank Space' hitmaker even gave Sabrina a sneak peek of her latest album, 'The Tortured Poets Department', before it was released in April.
Sabrina shared: "She always puts out music at a time where I didn’t realise I needed those songs.

"We’re very, very verbal with each other about our mutual love and admiration … She played me ‘But Daddy I Love Him’ before it came out, and that’s also one of my favourites."

Meanwhile, Sabrina recently admitted that she's become more choosy about who she lets into her life.

The 'Espresso' hitmaker - who is dating actor Barry Keoghan - has become more selective about her friends in recent years.

She told Cosmopolitan magazine: "You’re better able to know the people that you want to invite into your life, whereas before you are just nice to everybody and want to be everyone’s friend. I think that’s what’s happened to me in the last year and a half. 

"Instead of being like, 'Do people like me?' it’s 'Oh, do I actually like you?' Not in a mean way, but in a sense of, do I want this energy around me all the time? Is this someone who adds to my life?"
