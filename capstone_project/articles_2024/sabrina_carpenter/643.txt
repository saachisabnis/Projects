Why can’t we have nice things? After Rep. Jasmine Crockett clapped back at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene during a House Oversight Committee hearing earlier this week by bringing up her “bleach blonde, bad-built, butch body,” all eyes turned to Saturday Night Live. Surely the sketch show, and specifically Ego Nwodim, would make a meal out of that moment. Right? Well unfortunately, Nwodim took to Twitter midday Saturday to announce that despite fans (and the world at large) begging for her to take on the role, it isn’t happening. “Devastated to announce I will not be playing Rep. Jasmine Crockett tonight. Please respect my privacy as I grieve,” Nwodim wrote, bracing us all for disappointment. Crockett herself even replied, writing, “Let us all bow our heads and say a prayer for peace… like Lauren Boebert did during the hearing 🙄.”
Devastated to announce I will not be playing Rep. Jasmine Crockett tonight. Please respect my privacy as I grieve.
Does this mean the finale will skip over the congressional sparring entirely? Or will someone else be taking on the role of Rep. Crockett? And if so, who? Maybe Sabrina Carpenter will address it in her “Nonsense” outro? Or perhaps Crockett herself will appear to dole out even more roasts? In any case, as a consolation to those mourning not getting to see Nwodim slay some C-SPAN humor — Bowen Yang has thankfully posted his annual Ego Nwodim end-of-season Instagram supercut. She is cutting up.
