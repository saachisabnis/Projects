Celebrities flock to Taylor Swift shows like I flock to Twitter every time Tay's website goes down (never know what's happening, always spiraling), and her Singapore tour stops have been no exception!
Which brings us to Blackpink's Lisa, who was spotted watching Taylor perform last night (March 3) and appears to have had THE best time:
Plus, she went ahead and posted all her mannnny many friendship bracelets to the grid—and clearly went backstage to hang with Tay at some point after the show based on these pics:
Also in the crowd last night? Barry Keoghan, who was seen smiling to himself whilst watching Sabrina Carpenter do her "Nonsense" outro:
And just FYI this was also a pretty major show thanks to Taylor announcing yet another edition of The Tortured Poets Department. This one is called "The Black Dog," and Tay revealed the bonus track by saying "If you wanna look at the main screen I want to show you something. So this is the final edition of The Tortured Poets Department, it's the final cover. And it's called The Black Dog Edition, there's an exclusive song on this edition called 'The Black Dog.' I cannot wait for you to hear it."
Before you ask, yes: there are already a ton of theories as to WHAT IT ALL MEANS, so go ahead and dive in below if you're in the mood to obtain a PhD-level understanding of various definitions of "the black dog" in psychology and English folklore.
