By now, you’ve probably heard that Barry Keoghan and Sabrina Carpenter have split. Although fans are devastated by all of the messy rumors spreading, Barry is giving us yet another thing to talk about. If the news of the breakup wasn’t already shocking enough, Barry made a drastic hair change while filming his new movie Crime 101. Maybe his ex Sabrina made him believe blondes have more fun, but this new hair color is seriously throwing us for a loop.
Although we all know what it’s like to majorly change up our hair after a breakup, that’s most likely not the case with Barry. And as much as we’d like to believe the hair transformation was an impulsive decision post-breakup, let’s not forget Barry is a movie star and his blonde is definitely just for his upcoming role. Regardless, it’s still pretty surprising to see how different he looks with the new color.

We gotta give Barry props for keeping himself booked and busy despite recent events. The star debuted icy blonde hair with dark roots while on set—talk about a crazy reinvention. In fact, it’s the first time we’ve seen him since the news of the breakup dropped. No one knows for certain what happened between him and Sabrina, but it’s truly refreshing to see him doing his thing in the midst of everything.
Since Barry stepped on the scene, we’ve only ever known him as a brunette. His debut role in Saltburn had everyone shook (Sabrina Carpenter included, I suppose), so seeing such a huge departure from his signature look is pretty wild. (Not as wild as that bathtub scene, though) If nothing else, Barry is proving he can pull off any hair color. Who knows, maybe he’ll properly join the breakup hair squad and go red when he’s done filming.
