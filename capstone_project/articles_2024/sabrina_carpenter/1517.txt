Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's relationship is reportedly off and on and undefined after rumors recently began circulating that the pair have called it quits.
The Espresso singer and the Saltburn star are allegedly keeping their relationship casual, with a source recently telling People that they are "on and off." The new report comes amid rumors that the pair, who first sparked romance rumors in December 2023, had gone their separate ways. 
It is unclear where they stand as of Monday (August 19), but on Friday, Keoghan seemingly shut down breakup rumors after "liking" a photo Carpenter shared on Instagram posing in baby blue lingerie and matching heels as she promoted her upcoming album Short n' Sweet, per People.
Carpenter previously spoke to Rolling Stone in June where she didn't specify whether the Oscar-nominated actor, who even featured in the video for her song "Please Please Please," was her boyfriend and instead figured out a way to "skirt around the question."
"The [dating] pool is the pool, and when you meet people that feel authentic and are so brilliant and amazing in every way, that's what you do. Obviously, I write songs about exactly how I feel, so I guess I can't be so surprised that people are interested in who and what those songs are about. That's something that comes with the territory."
