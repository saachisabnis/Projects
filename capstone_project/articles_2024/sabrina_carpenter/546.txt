Gracie Abrams has notched her first ever No. 1 song in the U.K. with “That’s So True” topping the Official Singles Chart.

	The U.S. singer-songwriter has had a breakout year following the release of her sophomore album, The Secret Of Us, as well as an opening slot on Taylor Swift’s massive Eras Tour. The Secret Of Us debuted at No. 1 on the U.K.’s Official Albums Chart back in June and at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.

	“That’s So True”, which recently peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100, faced a stiff challenge from Gigi Perez’s “Sailor Song,” which held the top spot prior to this week’s battle. The Official Charts Company says that fewer than 1,200 chart units across downloads, streaming and physicals came between the pair. Another Abrams single, “I Love You, I’m Sorry,” is currently placed at No. 4.
