Barry Keoghan has gone off the grid ... or at least the Instagram grid, 'cause his snaps page is gone in the wake of his high-profile split with Sabrina Carpenter.
The actor's IG merely showed an error page Saturday morning ... along with a note that the "page may have been removed."
BK did not ditch all his socials, though ... his X account is still up and running ... but he hasn't posted anything on there since Nov 24.
Barry seemingly deleted his IG page just after he posted a series of thirst traps Friday.
The couple appear to have called it quits after about a year of dating ... during which SC even included him in her music video for "Please Please Please"
There have been rumors and speculation -- but zero proof -- that BK may have cheated on Sabrina.
Since the breakup, we've seen Sabrina at a screening for her Christmas Netflix special in NYC, while Barry was spotted filming "Crime 101" in Los Angeles -- rocking that blond hairdo.
