Shawn Mendes is leveling with his audience about where he stands with Camila Cabello, as well as his thoughts on the recent uptick in gossip regarding their former romance and breakup.

	The conversation first started in late September, when the “Stitches” singer-songwriter opened up on the Jay Shetty Podcast about how he and the C,XOXO artist have been “preserving [their] private little fire of love for each other” despite breaking up in 2023, two years after they first ended their romance in 2021. A couple days later, a fan commented, “they don’t play about each other” on a tweet quoting his podcast interview — and Mendes retweeted the comment and agreed, “no we don’t” on Wednesday (Oct. 2).

	










	A couple hours after that, he came back online to clarify why he engaged with the comment in the first place. “i guess to be honest it came from a place of being a little annoyed with all the projection over the last few months about us,” Mendes wrote, referring to Cabello. “I’m usually pretty good at just watching all the ‘noise’ go by but lately it’s been kinda bugging me 🤷🏻‍♂️ feeling human i guess.”

	In a follow-up tweet, Mendes added, “yeah part of me knows quoting a tweet and saying that is gunna start a little spin up and i guess to be honest part of me just wanted to address it and actually have a real honest relationship with you guys about how it feels from my side.”

	The “Mercy” artist didn’t specify in his posts, but much “noise” has indeed been made about his and Cabello’s relationship this year — particularly as it relates to Sabrina Carpenter. Following his first breakup from Cabello, Mendes was rumored to be dating the “Espresso” singer in early 2023, shortly after which he got back together with the “Havana” vocalist. Their rekindled romance only appeared to last a few months after that, and Cabello later confirmed that they’d split once again on Call Her Daddy.

	Many fans have since speculated that Carpenter sings about the situation on her Billboard 200-topping new album Short n’ Sweet, particularly the track “Coincidence.” “What a surprise, your phone just died/ Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs/ Palm Springs looks nice, but who’s by your side?/ Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew,” reads the song’s lyrics. “What a coincidence/ Oh wow, you just broke up again.”

	










	No matter what, though, Mendes says that he and Cabello put in the work to stay on good terms. “I’ll be the first to text her, she’ll be the first to text me,” he added on Jay Shetty’s show Sept. 30, noting that the exes maintain “immense honesty” and “over-communication” to this day. “As long as we’re good, all the noise is just noise.”
