Travis Scott is looking to overthrow Sabrina Carpenter’s No. 1 reign with Days Before Rodeo.
Billboard reports that the rapper could be out for revenge as the vinyl LP editions of Days Before Rodeo, which is offered as a regular record and as two deluxe vinyl box sets, have been sent out to fans. Although the album dropped to No. 106 from No. 2 and that the streaming numbers are incomparable to that of Carpenter’s Short N’ Sweet, the massive sales from the vinyl LPs may be enough to boost Scott right back up to No. 1.
Scott and Carpenter battled it out for the top spot on the Billboard 200 a few weeks ago, and it was the latter who came out victorious with a difference of just under 1,000 units. Short N’ Sweet has remained at No. 1 for two weeks straight now, but that may change next week.
