Shawn Mendes has apparently addressed his love triangle with Camila Cabello and Sabrina Carpenter.
Without naming names, Mendes acknowledged past relationship drama in his appearance on the Thursday, December 12 episode of John Mayer’s SiriusXM show “How’s Life?”
“So, I’m with someone, [and] two days before going to hang with my ex, [I] express I’m going to hang with my ex because I have unresolved feelings,” the musician, 26, said in a video preview.
Mendes now thinks that instead of giving two days’ notice, he should have let her know “two weeks” ahead of time. 
“Is there something in all of this that you could say, ‘Yeah, I played that wrong?’” Mayer, 47, asked his guest. 
In response, Mendes shared his biggest life lesson: “No one gets out of this life without getting hurt and no one gets out of this life without hurting someone.”
Mendes and Cabello, 27, dated from 2019 to 2021 after years of friendship. In February 2023, Mendes was first spotted with Carpenter, 25, and that March, the twosome attended the Vanity Fair Oscars Party separately. Entertainment Tonight reported that they were an item, but Mendes denied that he was dating Carpenter.
Mendes subsequently rekindled his relationship with Cabello after they were seen kissing at Coachella in April 2023. Mendes and Cabello ultimately split for good in June 2023, with a source exclusively telling Us Weekly at the time that Cabello was the one who “decided to end things” and Mendes was “very upset” that they could not make it work.
Carpenter’s fans noticed apparent nods to the situation on her latest album Short n’ Sweet. For one, the title refers to “some of these relationships and how some of them were the shortest I’ve ever had and they affected me the most,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.
The lyrics of the song “Coincidence” addressed a man who got back together with his ex shortly after a split.
“The second I put my head on your chest / She knew, she’s got a real sixth sense,” Carpenter sang. “Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice / And without her even bein’ here, she’s back in your life / Now she’s in the same damn city on the same damn night.”

The music video for “Taste” fanned the flames with Jenna Ortega starring as the girlfriend of Carpenter’s ex-boyfriend. 
The single sent a message to an ex’s new girlfriend with the lines, “I heard you’re back together and if that’s true / You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you / If you want forever, I bet you do / Just know you’ll taste me too.”
In an awkward moment, Mendes performed during September’s MTV Video Music Awards and soon after he left the stage, Carpenter followed up with a medley that included “Taste” as well as her hits “Espresso” and “Please Please Please.”
