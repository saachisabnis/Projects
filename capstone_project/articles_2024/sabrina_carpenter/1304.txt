Sabrina Carpenter recently went viral for "arresting" Millie Bobby Brown during a show on her 'Short N' Sweet' tour. The singer noticed the Stranger Things star in the crowd and included her in a segment of the performance. Brown playfully interacted with Carpenter, holding up fluffy pink handcuffs. Carpenter's ongoing US tour celebrates her 'Short N' Sweet' album, with UK and European dates announced for next year. Meanwhile, Stranger Things fans can look forward to the show's fifth and final season, with star Maya Hawke teasing that the episodes are like "making eight movies."
