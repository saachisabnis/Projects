Sabrina Carpenter is working late, because she has to bail out her man, Barry Keoghan, in her new music video, “Please Please Please.” They star as a Bonnie and Clyde–type duo who keep getting into trouble. Their crime? Serving too hard. The video opens up with Carpenter seated next to a woman in business casual just as she gets bailed out of jail. She passes by Keoghan as he’s getting booked, and the two start their romance. Once he’s fresh out of the slammer, he gets back into old habits as Carpenter coos, “Please please please, don’t prove them right.” Eventually, she grows tired of his shit and handcuffs him, leaving him with a kiss, probably tired of all the late-night shifts.
