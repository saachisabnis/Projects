If you’re looking for a Halloween costume, here are some predictions of the most popular costumes from pop culture we plan to see this October 31st. 
1. Moo Deng
Stay moisturized with this costume as Moo Deng! Moo Deng is a Pygamy hippo who recently took the internet by storm with her sassy attitude. I plan to see a lot of cute takes on this look! 
2. Sabrina and Jenna
Sabrina Carpenter and Jenna Ortega in the “Taste” music video make a great duo costume. This is a spooky but cute costume idea you can do with your best friend! (Fake chainsaws only.)  
3. Beetlejuice
With the new movie “BeetlejuiceBeetlejuice”, there’s never been a better time to pull off this costume! To make this a couple’s costume, wear a red dress and veil to be Lydia. 
4. Deadpool and Wolverine
Deadpool and Wolverine could be a best friend or a couple costume (according to Deadpool). The ponytail is optional! 
5. Love Island
These are super easy friend group costumes! Wear any beachy outfit with a mic pack, and you and your friends can be the cast of “Love Island”. This can include the guy friends too! 
6. Saltburn
Another super easy and affordable group costume idea is the Midsummer’s Night Dream party from “Saltburn”. You can all wear wings or antlers and some form of party outfit!
