It’s an award show like no other as SpongeBob SquarePants (Tom Kenny) and Patrick Star (Bill Fagerbakke) host the 2024 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards!
Coming to you live from Bikini Bottom, this year’s annual slime-filled celebration of pop culture features over 50 first-time nominees as a host of popular stars — including The Bear’s Ayo Edebiri, Mean Girls standout Reneé Rapp, Sabrina Carpenter, Austin Butler, and more — compete for the show’s signature orange blimp award. Taylor Swift doesn’t have any Bad Blood with this year’s show since the immensely popular musician leads the way with six nominations, followed by Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, Olivia Rodrigo, and Justin Timberlake, with four noms each.
