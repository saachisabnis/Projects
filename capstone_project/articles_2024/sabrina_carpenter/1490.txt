Alessandra Ambrosio, Halle Bailey and Karrueche Tran sizzled up a storm at the CELSIUS Cosmic Desert Event at Coachella this weekend.
The annual music festival draws a glittering audience of A-list stars from around the world when it is held every year in California.
This year was no exception, with internationally renowned bombshells flocking to the Coachella Valley to take in the musical acts assembled for the extravaganza.
For her latest public sighting, Alessandra put her sculpted supermodel body on display in a tantalizingly revealing ensemble.
She slipped into a fluttering sleeveless white dress that flapped open from the bust down, exposing the black leather undergarments beneath.

Halle, who achieved new heights of fame last year in the live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid, was seaside chic in an aquamarine top that flowed down her sides, baring her midriff and cleavage in between.
The actress and singer, who rose to fame in the sister act Chloe + Halle, added a touch of country style to the look with a set of acid wash Daisy Dukes and tan cowgirl boots, while also sporting a custom 'HALO' necklace from Simon G. 
Karrueche Tran flaunted her ample assets in a plunging off-white netted dress that also hinted mesmerizingly at the supermodel hourglass physique underneath. 
Wearing her hair short, she exuded a summery air in a pair of pink-rimmed orange-tinted shades, as well as a colorful beaded necklace that highlighted her décolletage.

Chantel Jeffries, who shot to fame as a model and has now entered the music business as Ceejay the DJ, wore a daring top that consisted solely of a set of peekaboo sleeves connected by a strip of fabric below the neck.

Thrown this Friday on the first day of Coachella, the CELSIUS Cosmic Desert Event featured a live performance from none other than T-Pain. 
.The annual Coachella Music and Arts Festival officially kicked off its first weekend on Friday, April 12 and will come to an end on Sunday, April 14. Weekend two will then begin on April 19 and conclude on Sunday, April 21. 
The 23rd Coachella Festival will take place at the Empire Polo Club located in Indio, California - which is around 23 miles away from the city of Palm Springs. 
Fans will be able to livestream the festival on YouTube beginning at 4pm (PST) on April 12. 
In between sets and when music artists are not on the stage, viewers will have the chance to watch replays of performances, as well as exclusive coverage and behind-the-scenes moments.  
The headliners for this year's festivities include Lana Del Rey, Tyler the Creator, Doja Cat and also No Doubt. 
Thrown this Friday on the first day of Coachella, the CELSIUS Cosmic Desert Event featured a live performance from none other than T-Pain
Earlier this year in January, fans of No Doubt were sent into a frenzy  after it was announced that Gwen Stefani will reunite with her bandmates at the popular festival. 
The singer - who has forged a successful solo career - made the big reveal on Instagram as she shared this year's festival line-up to her stories. 
Gwen, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young shared a fun Zoom call video announcing the reunion news on social media. The rock band last performed together nearly 10 years ago in 2015.
The group is known for hits such as It's My Life, Just A Girl, Don't Speak and also Hella Good.  
Lana Del Rey - known for her smash hit Summertime Sadness - last performed at Coachella 10 years ago in 2014 and this will be her first time headlining.
'I am really excited about headlining. It's funny, because it's going to be about 10 years to the day that I was [last] there, which is insane,' the songstress recently told Vogue in January. 
'I've known I was headlining for a long time, because you get booked way in advance, so I've thought about it for a while, and I already have a lot of things set into motion.' 
Lana expressed, 'If all goes well, it'll be as big and bold as I hope it will be. Architecturally, it's going to depend on the structure, and whether I can make it…But I'm really excited about it. I'm excited, so my fans can get excited.' 
Her makeup artist, Etienne Ortega, also briefly opened up about the star's glammed up look for the stage and revealed Lana has 'amazing surprises.' 
'She'll kill me if I say anything,' he told People in an article published on Friday. 'But she's got a lot of amazing surprises, I'll tell you that much!' 
'I'm going to go back to what I said earlier about something fresh and new and different. I think tonight's look will be maybe even unexpected, but different...It'll still be Lana, but just different.' 
On the topic of her makeup look, Ortega stated, 'We're still going to have a liner. Lana can't be Lana without her infamous liner.' 
'But tonight's color story is a bit more warm tones. Usually we do a cool-tone eye, a very black, bold liner. We're going for a little bit more of browns, like a brown warm sandy palette with gold, with a little bit of a golden, radiant skin.' 
He also later expressed that during the festival, 'I think there's going to be a lot of little Lanas running around. I definitely think people are going to be wearing the flower crowns.' 
This will mark Doja Cat's third Coachella performance and her first time as headliner.
Tyler, The Creator took the Coachella stage in 2015 and 2018. He has made a number of surprise appearances at the festival over the years.
Like Lana and Doja, this is the rapper's first headlining Coachella gig.
Other notable Coachella 2024 acts include: Ice Spice, Lil Uzi Vert, J Balvin, Sabrina Carpenter, Bebe Rexha, Renee Rapp, Grimes, Sublime, Jon Batiste and Lil Yachty.
Coachella is an annual music and arts festival which brings together some of the biggest artists in the industry and thousands of celebrities, influencers, fans, and music lovers from around the world. 
It is held in the Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert every year and features acts that span several genres including rock, pop, hip-hop, and electronic.
The first Coachella was held in October 1999 as it featured headliners Beck, Tool, and Rage Against The Machine and has since grown into a 150K capacity festival which routinely sells out. 
On Friday, some artists that will take to the various stages during the festival include Lana Del Rey, Sabrina Carpenter, Tinashe and Suki Waterhouse - who confirmed the birth of her first child with Robert Pattinson earlier this month. 
On Saturday, Tyler the Creator, No Doubt, JUNGLE, Raye, Jon Batiste and Vampire Weekend are just a few of the performers that will take to the stage. 
And on Sunday, Doja Cat, J Balvin, Bebe Rexha, Renee Rapp and Jhené Aiko are some of the stars that are also slated to perform.
