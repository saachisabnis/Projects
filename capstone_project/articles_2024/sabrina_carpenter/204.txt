Fresh off a “Saturday Night Live” performance and a stint opening for international shows on Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, Sabrina Carpenter is letting the good times roll. On Thursday, she announced a North American tour in support of her upcoming album “Short n’ Sweet,” which is set to release on Aug. 23.
The 25-year-old singer, best known for radio hits like “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” will visit the Northwest this fall, stopping at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle on Nov. 6. 
Carpenter will also perform at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C., on Nov. 4 and the Moda Center in Portland on Nov. 7. Declan McKenna will open all three shows. 
Ticket presales begin next week. Cash App card holders will be able to access exclusive presale tickets starting at 10 a.m. June 24. Fans can also sign up via Carpenter’s website for a presale beginning at 10 a.m. June 25. Tickets will be on sale to the public via Ticketmaster on Friday, June 28. 
The Short n’ Sweet Tour begins in September in Columbus, Ohio, and runs through Nov. 15, where it wraps up in Los Angeles. 
Carpenter, who has quickly become one of pop’s biggest names, unveiled the “Short n’ Sweet” album cover art this month on social media. The album, her first since 2022’s “Emails I Can’t Send,” will be the singer’s sixth studio album.
Editor’s note: Carpenter announced the tour dates on Thursday, not Tuesday.
