Barry Keoghan has seemingly fueled speculation that Sabrina Carpenter’s steamy “Bed Chem” lyrics are about him.
On Sunday, October 20, the Irish actor was spotted in the crowd for the pop star’s Short n’ Sweet Tour stop at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia, via fan footage found online.
When Carpenter, 25, sang “Bed Chem” — her song that seems to reference their low-key relationship — Keoghan, 32, appeared to cover a knowing smile with a piece of paper upon hearing the lyrics “Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent?”
In September, Keoghan paid homage to “Bed Chem” while sporting a white jacket front-row at Burberry’s London Fashion Week show. 
Keoghan and Carpenter have been dating since 2023, but prefer to keep their status private — which is why it was such a surprise when Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” video was released in June of this year, and featured Keoghan in a starring role. 
In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning earlier this month, Carpenter explained that she cast Keoghan — a 2023 Oscar nominee for his supporting role in The Banshees of Inisherin — because she admired his acting skills. “I, genuinely — like, a not-even-biased opinion — I was like, Who’s the greatest actor that I can find for this music video?” she said. “And he was next to me in a chair. And he was so excited about it!”

In the video, the Saltburn star portrays Carpenter’s criminal love interest; he gets arrested for robbing a woman at gunpoint, before Carpenter handcuffs him to a chair and tapes his mouth shut. “He likes the song, which is great,” said Carpenter. “He does like my music a lot, yeah.”

While Carpenter hasn’t offered any spicy details of their relationship, she has previously gushed about her Keoghan’s skills on camera. “I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation,” she told Variety. “So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”
And in an interview with The Guardian in August, she said working together was “one of the best experiences I’ve ever had” too, coyly adding: “I’m very honored and I got to work with such a great actor.”
As for speaking publicly about her dating life, “It’s not what I signed up for, but I can’t really help when I was born,” she told the outlet.  “I want to be honest — I want to just write about what’s happening in my life as a 25-year-old girl. But it comes with the territory and I just have to be like … OK!”
