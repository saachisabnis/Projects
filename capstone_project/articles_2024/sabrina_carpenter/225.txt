Don't mess with Sabrina Carpenter!
On Wednesday (August 21), the hitmaker shared a dramatic teaser on her Instagram for the upcoming music video for her next single "Taste," and it features another familiar face. While it's not her "on and off" rumored boyfriend Barry Keoghan, who starred in her "Please Please Please" video, Wednesday star Jenna Ortega has a starring role in the video dropping Friday (August 23).
The short n' sweet clip only gives a hint of what's to come in the video, but as Carpenter herself sings, it leaves "quite an impression" as we see an assortment of dangerous weapons laid out on top of a bed, a sharp juxtaposition of killer instruments on a delicate pink bedspread, complete with a baby pink teddy bear. 
After grabbing a knife, Carpenter arrives at a mansion and runs up the stairs before ultimately confronting Ortega and a man while the pair are mid-shower. The clip ends with the "Feather" singer fixing her lipstick while staring at her reflection in a large knife.
"Taste," co-written by Carpenter alongside Julia Michaels and Amy Allen, is the third single off her soon-to-be-released sixth studio album Short n' Sweet, also out Friday, per Billboard. Her previous singles include "Espresso" and "Please Please Please."
"Taste" drops Friday, August 23.
