Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart’s history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album units and streaming equivalent album units. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	Perry’s first-week sales were aided by 143’s availability across eight vinyl variants (including a signed edition), four CD variants (including a signed edition), a cassette tape and multiple digital download variants (including two exclusive to her webstore, each with bonus tracks).

	As for Roan at No. 1, her album garnered a 328% week-over-week sales increase, selling 56,000 copies. The growth is owed to the release of four new vinyl variants and a cassette tape in celebration of the album’s first anniversary on Sept. 22. Of the album’s sales, vinyl comprises 50,000 – easily Roan’s best week on vinyl and the sixth-largest week for any vinyl album in 2024.

	P1Harmony collects its best sales week yet, as Sad Song starts at No. 3 with 28,000 copies sold. It’s also the third top 10-charting set for the pop ensemble. The first-week sales were helped by the album’s availability across 24 collectible CD variants, a vinyl edition and a cassette. All variants contain branded paper ephemera like photocards and postcards.

	










	Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet rises one spot to No. 4 with 15,000 sold (up 1%).

	Lil Tecca nabs his best sales week ever, and first top 10, as his new album Plan A arrives at No. 5 with 13,000 sold. Previously, the rapper had never sold more than 4,500 copies of an album in a week. The new set’s sales were encouraged by two CD variants (including a signed edition) and multiple digital download variants (including three exclusive to the artist’s webstore, two of which included bonus tracks).

	Keith Urban clocks his ninth top 10 on Top Album Sales as High bows at No. 6 with 12,000 sold. Its first week was helped by four vinyl variants, three CD variants – with some retail-exclusives containing branded paper ephemera.

	Future’s Mixtape Pluto enters at No. 7 with 10,000 sold – his best sales week since 2020. Nearly 7,500 of that sum was driven by vinyl sales – aided by three vinyl variants. The set was also available on CD and as a digital download. The album was issued as an 11-song standard album (on vinyl, CD and download) and as an expanded 17-song set (on download).

	Stray Kids’ former No. 1 ATE rises one rung to No. 8 with nearly 8,000 sold (down 13%).

	Rounding out the top 10 of the new Top Album Sales chart are debuts from the Grateful Dead’s expansive archival live boxed sets, Friend of the Devils: April 1978, which starts at No. 9 (7,500) and Seether’s The Surface Seems So Far at No. 10 (just over 7,000).

	The Dead package – sold exclusively via the band’s official webstore – captures eight concerts staged in April 1978 and is available either as a digital download or 19-CD boxed set, with pricing ranging from $159.98 to $199.98.

	










	For Seether, the new Surface marks the band’s ninth studio album and seventh top 10-charting effort on Top Album Sales.
