	After Manifest, another high-concept, serialized drama that ran on NBC for 3 seasons is making an impressive debut on Netflix. Season 1 of La Brea, starring Natalie Zea and Eoin Macken, was the #3 most watched English-language series globally on Netflix for the week of Dec. 2. That was despite the sci-fi drama being available only in selected countries, excluding the U.S., the UK, Brazil and other top Netflix territories. 

La Brea (5 million views) was only bested on the weekly list by Last week’s #1, limited series The Madness (13.3M) and the high-profile new Kiera Knightly thriller drama Black Doves (10.8M). Unlike Manifest, which went on to produce a final season for Netflix after a dramatic cancellation by NBC, the Universal TV-produced La Brea wrapped its story with its abbreviated third season on the broadcast network.

	










	Holiday special A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (2.6M) barely made the Top 10 in its opening weekend at #8.
