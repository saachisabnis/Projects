A New York City monsignor who raised eyebrows by allowing pop star Sabrina Carpenter to film a video in his church was relieved of duties after he allegedly mishandled nearly $2 million of church funds, church officials announced.
Monsignor Jamie Gigantiello, of Our Lady of Mount Carmel — Annunciation Parish, no longer holds any pastoral oversight or governance role at the parish, Bishop Robert J. Brennan of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn said in a statement Monday.
The decision followed an investigation after the parish was subpoenaed amid New York City Mayor Eric Adams' corruption scandal, NBC New York reported.
The Diocese said the investigation "uncovered a pattern of serious violations of Diocesan policies and protocols by Monsignor Gigantiello."
The Diocese accused the monsignor of transferring a total of $1.9 million in parish funds to bank accounts affiliated with the law firm of Frank Carone, as well as two companies affiliated with him. Carone was at one point the chief of staff to Adams, according to NBC New York.
In January 2019, Gigantiello allegedly transferred $1 million of parish funds to Carone’s law firm, the Diocese said. Gigantiello failed to inform the Diocese of the transfer or seek required prior approval, the statement said. The Diocese also accused him of failing to properly document the transfer and said Gigantiello did not obtain necessary details from Carone about what the money would be used for.
The $1 million transfer violated investment policies and protocols, the Diocese said. Carone's law firm paid back the money with roughly 9% interest.
In August 2021 and November 2021, Gigantiello allegedly made two more transfers, totaling $900,000 of parish funds, to two companies affiliated with Carone, according to the Diocese.
"Monsignor again did not inform Diocesan officials or seek the required approval for either transfer," the Diocese said. "The Monsignor apparently made both transfers pursuant to notes providing one-year repayment terms at agreed interest rates. Again, it appears that Monsignor did not obtain necessary details from Mr. Carone about the relevant companies or the use of these funds."
Gigantiello, without consulting the Diocese, requested early repayment of the principal amounts for both loans in February 2022 without requiring the payment to the parish of the substantial interest provided for under the notes, the Diocese said.
The investigation also found other instances of the monsignor transferring and using parish funds in violation of Diocesan policies and protocols. Gigantiello has also been accused of using a church credit card "for substantial personal expenses," the Diocese said, noting that the charges remain under investigation.
Arthur Aidala, an attorney for Gigantiello, told NBC New York that the credit card expenses were authorized in writing as part of the monsignor’s compensation agreement. Aidala also said the money transfers benefitted the parish, claiming that the church was paid 12% interest on the $1 million payment and not 9% as the Diocese said.
Carone and his spokesperson did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment on Tuesday.
Bishop Brennan said he was "saddened" over what the investigation uncovered.
"In order to safeguard the public trust, and to protect church funds, I have appointed Bishop Witold Mroziewski as administrator of the Parish," he said in a statement.
Gigantiello got in trouble last year after he allowed pop star Sabrina Carpenter to film a music video at the church, which the Diocese said violated its policy and triggered the investigation that led to Monday's announcement.
Brennan removed Gigantiello as the Diocese’s Vicar for Development and relieved him from all administrative and financial oversight at the parish after the music video incident.
Deacon Dean Dobbins was named as the temporary administrator, but in Monday's statement, Brennan said the deacon was relieved after he allegedly used racist and offensive language during a recorded private conversation.
Brennan said the conversation was "apparently recorded at Monsignor Gigantiello’s direction without the Deacon’s consent. It was wrong to secretly record Deacon Dobbins, but the use of such language by any church employee is unacceptable and will not be tolerated." Dobbins could not be immediately reached for comment.
