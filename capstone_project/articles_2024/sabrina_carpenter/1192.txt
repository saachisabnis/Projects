Netflix has an extremely busy month lined up in December.
This month, the streaming service will not only remove a bunch of titles, but add a huge roster of movies and TV shows, new and old, which will keep subscribers entertained right up until 2025.
Among the new releases are Black Doves, an action thriller starring Ben Whishaw and Keira Knightley, Gabriel García Márquez adaptation One Hundred Years of Solitude and Pablo Larraín’s Maria Callas biopic starring Angelina Jolie.
But it’s the second season of Squid Game that most people are anticipating. The follow-up arrives three years after the first season became a surprise hit for the streamer, amassing so many views it became its most-watched title in history. 
Find a full list of every movie and TV coming to Netflix this month below.
