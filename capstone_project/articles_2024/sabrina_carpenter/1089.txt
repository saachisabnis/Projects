Barry Keoghan had the best reaction to his rumored girlfriend Sabrina Carpenter's flirty lyrics while attending one of her concerts over the weekend.
The Saltburn star attended the "Espresso" singer's Short n' Sweet Tour stop in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sunday (October 20) and appeared to enjoy watching his girlfriend wow the crowd with her provocative performances, but at least one song had him seeming giddy and in awe, per People. 
As Carpenter rolled around a bed on stage for her steamy track "Bed Chem," from her latest album Short n' Sweet, she sang, "Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent?" 
The lyrics appeared to strike a chord with the Irish actor, specifically the "thick accent" quip, and he covered his mouth with a piece of paper seemingly trying hide his smile and maybe even a blush. The sweet moment was captured by a fan in the crowd and shared on social media. 
Carpenter and Keoghan first sparked romance rumors in December 2023, and he even landed a starring role in her "Please Please Please" music video. In August, some rumors began to spread that the pair had called it quits — with one source claiming the pair were "on and off" — but Keoghan seemed to shut down those rumors after leaving a cheeky comment on a post paying tribute to his girlfriend.
