Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” reaches No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the fifth total week. In addition to topping the Hot 100, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)’ is also the first song to lead in streams, radio airplay, and sales simultaneously since Adele’s “Easy on Me” accomplished the same feat back in 2021. Shaboozey’s crossover hit single also tops the Hot Country Songs chart for the ninth week, becoming the first song ever to lead in streams, airplay, and sales while also topping both the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts. The rest of the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 5 remains unchanged from last week, with Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, staying put at No. 2, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” sticking at No. 3, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” holding tight at No. 4, and Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” remaining at No. 5.
