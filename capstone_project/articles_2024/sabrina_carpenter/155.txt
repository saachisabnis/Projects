Over the past few weeks, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Feather” has emerged as one of the hottest songs at pop radio. The song has been posting massive week-over-week spin gains, steadily ranking as one of the format’s greatest airplay gainers since the start of the year.
The rise continues this week — and it should be enough to thrust “Feather” into the Top 10 of the Mediabase pop airplay chart.
“Feather” already holds a Top 10 position on the rolling chart; given its rate of gain and absence of imminent competition from below, it should have no trouble retaining its position through the close of tracking.
Should it indeed secure a Top 10 position, “Feather” will follow “Nonsense” as Carpenter’s second consecutive (and overall) #1 at the format.
