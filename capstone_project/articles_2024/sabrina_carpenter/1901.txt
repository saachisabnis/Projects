As a busy actress and mom of three — including a 4-month-old — Jenna Dewan admits that it can be hard to have hobbies and interests outside of her kids. Yet, that doesn’t stop her from obsessing over her favorite movies, books and other media.
“It tends to be when you have kids, a lot of times, their obsessions become your obsessions because you’re watching it altogether,” Dewan, 43, shared exclusively in her “What I’m Obsessed With” feature in the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. “You don’t have the time to like something on your own.”
Dewan welcomed her second child, daughter Rhiannon, with partner Steve Kazee in June. She also shares son Callum, 4, with Kazee, and daughter Everly, 11, with her ex-husband, Channing Tatum — both of whom were so excited to welcome a new little sister to the family.
“[Callum] is so sweet with her and he calls her baby,” she shared with Us. “He really gives her lots of hugs and kisses … So far he’s loving it. I think maybe when she’s a bit older and can actually start taking his toys, we’ll see, but right now we’re in a good place.”
Like many new moms, Dewan has been dealing with changes to her body, particularly her skin, post-pregnancy, which is why she teamed up with dermatologist-recommended skincare brand Neostrata.
“[Their products] work really well. I found them initially with my melasma issues,” she said, noting that products like the Triple Firming Cream helped with her skin condition, which causes darkened patches or spots on the body. “During postpartum, I was noticing things were shifting a little bit, and I was needing a bit more tightening and sculpting that I might not have noticed prior to having Rhiannon.”
Keep scrolling for more of Dewan’s latest obsessions, including the movie and TV show she and daughter Everly can’t get enough of:
Evie and I just watched a movie called Ophelia. It’s an older movie from a couple of years ago, [which we watched] because there’s a director that I might work with that did Ophelia [Claire McCarthy], and we loved it. It was cause for a lot of conversations about Hamlet. So that’s our fun obsession of the moment!
We’re very into Korean K-Dramas at the moment, so we binged a TV show called My Demon, which was a full experience. It was my first K-Drama. We were both crying. It’s so traumatic and good. There’s a lot of, ‘Mom, will you look up and see if there are any My Demon T-shirts?’ That’s the latest.
I recently started A Little Life because I saw so many people talking about how it was gut-wrenching. So I try to read before bed. I’m a few chapters in, and it does feel like it’s going to take me on quite a journey and be very emotional.

I was obsessed with the new Billie Eilish album [Hit Me Hard and Soft] right when Rhiannon was born, around the time it came out. Every single day I was playing it because I felt like, start to finish, it was a perfect album. I just loved it as a pop album. So that was getting played on rotation non-stop. I’m also really into Sabrina Carpenter’s new album [Short n’ Sweet]. I think she’s adorable and so cute and her music is really good. “Espresso” is a big hit over here, and her whole album’s really good.
I just did a podcast with Jonathan Mark, who is this mind-blowing medium. We are looking to produce a TV show together. So, I met him, and he asked me to do his podcast [“Connect”], and he did a little reading for me at the end. It was really incredible. It was mind-blowing. He’s this incredible guy: He’s young, he was a lacrosse player, he’s a full sports-y guy’s guy, and he’s always just had this ability, and I find that really interesting. His podcast is really good, so check that one out!
