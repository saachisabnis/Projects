That’s that smell, “Espresso”? Well, no. Sabrina Carpenter is launching a new fragrance, but it doesn’t appear that it smells like coffee.
Sabrina announced on Instagram that the website FragrancebySabrina.com is officially launching on July 25 and added a picture of a bowl of cherries. Then, referring to the line in “Espresso” in which she sings, “soft skin and I perfumed it for ya,” she wrote in the caption, “soft skin and I [cherries emoji] it for you.”
This new scent will be an addition to Sabrina’s other fragrances, Sweet Tooth and Caramel Dream.
