Are Sabrina Carpenter's 'Bed Chem' lyrics about Barry Keoghan? Here's what she's said about the song and who inspired it.
'Nonsense' and 'Espresso' are known as Sabrina Carpenter's horniest songs but now 'Bed Chem' has just entered the chat and fans think the lyrics are inspired by her first meeting with Barry Keoghan. 
Sabrina Carpenter has long been praised for being unashamedly horny in her music. From her custom 'Nonsense' outros to literally the whole of 'Espresso', Sabrina knows how to express lust in music. Talking to Rolling Stone, Sabrina said: "Those real moments where I‚Äôm just a 25-year-old girl who‚Äôs super horny are as real as when I‚Äôm going through a heartbreak."
Now, Sabrina has outdone herself with another bedroom banger and she's explained what her 'Bed Chem' lyrics are about. Not only that, but she's also explained where she came up with the title... and the hilarious reason behind it is actually much more innocent that you might think.

'Bed chem' is short for "bedroom chemistry" and it's essentially about Sabrina meeting someone and being so attracted to them that she starts fantasising what they would be like in bed together. Sabrina sings: And now the next thing I know, I'm like / Manifest that you're oversized / I digress, got me scrollin' like / Out of breath, got me going like...
The second verse reaches true levels of horny Shakespeare with Sabrina singing: Come ride on me, I mean, camaraderie / Said you're not in my timezone but you wanna be / Where art thou? Why not upon-eth me? / See it in my mind - let's fulfill the prophecy.
In the bridge, Sabrina adds: And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (Bed chem) / And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (Bed chem) / And I bet it's even better than in my head.

However, the title of 'Bed Chem' didn't initially stem from a sexual experience... it was actually inspired by a sleepover with her best friend. 
Explaining the title during her Tiny Desk Concert, Sabrina said: "I have a best friend, her name's Paloma, and we were having like, this weekend in an Airbnb. Her and I had to split this King bed and I'd never had a sleepover with her before where we were sharing a bed. We'd always be in like separate rooms so it was kind of a test for our friendship."
"So I had this sleepover with her, and we were like, talking and it's like, we fall asleep at the exact same time like, no one had to say, 'I think we should probably head to sleep now'," she continued. "We both just shut our eyes, went to bed, shut up and then no one was kicking, no one was snoring, and we both woke up at the same [time]."
"Like, you know when you roll over and it's very peaceful and you're like, 'Good morning! Good morning!' You don't have to like, punch them to wake them up. She just woke up and I was like, 'We have really good bed chem!'"
Sabrina then added: "And so I saved this as a title, and then I met a guy and I was like 'We'd have really good bed chem in a different way than I have with Paloma!'"

Fans think a few of the lines appear to reference Sabrina's relationship with Barry Keoghan. Sabrina opens the song singing: I was in a sheer dress the day that we met / We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec. She later adds: Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent?
Sabrina and Barry met each other for the first time in September 2023 at a Givenchy fashion show and Sabrina was wearing a sheer dress and Barry was wearing a white jacket. Not only that but the "thick accent" line appears to be a reference to Barry's Irish accent.
Barry has since called the song his favourite track from 'Short n' Sweet' on Instagram stories writing: "BED CHEM my fave just sayin".

Discussing 'Bed Chem' with Paper, Sabrina explained: "There was a lot of steam in the studio. It was real hot and heavy. No, I'm kidding. My friend Paloma and I coined the term ['bed chem']. I went to the studio that day and was like, ‚ÄòI have this title and idea, and we have to make it sexy and a little bit unserious at the same time because it is such a ridiculous concept."
Sabrina also said that she was heavily inspired by Christina Aguilera when she recorded the song. She said: "I love Christina. That was one of my very first idols and icons. I was 11 years old and you couldn't get her name out of my mouth. She's very special to me. Those songs raised me."
Brb - listening to 'Bed Chem' on repeat until further notice.
