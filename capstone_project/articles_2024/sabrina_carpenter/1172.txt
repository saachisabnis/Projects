Barry Keoghan and Sabrina Carpenter were definitely one of the more unexpected couples to emerge in 2024, but I guess it makes sense. Individually, their careers were at a similar point in terms of trajectory. Now, questions of whether they’re still together have begun to swirl, in no small part to one of her social media posts.

In an interview with Variety in early August, Carpenter sort of opened up about having Keoghan in her “Please, Please, Please” video. “He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that,” she said, before speaking about his acting chops.

“I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation,” she continued. “So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”
I mean, yes and no? It’s interesting because a source told People in August that they’re “on and off.” But would you put someone you’re just having a fling with in your music video? No, right? And then in an interview with Rolling Stone, Carpenter was asked if she’d refer to the actor as her boyfriend. “How do I skirt around this question?”
She continued: “The [dating] pool is the pool, and when you meet people that feel authentic and are so brilliant and amazing in every way, that’s what you do. Obviously, I write songs about exactly how I feel, so I guess I can’t be so surprised that people are interested in who and what those songs are about. That’s something that comes with the territory.”
The breakup rumors started in August with a tweet from DeuxMoi that read: “Sabrina and Barry broke up.” Grain of salt, of course, there’s a been online discourse about the decreasing reliability of the celeb gossip page (then again, they’ve never claimed to be trustworthy). 
There was also a TikTok made by Carpenter herself where she waved, saluted, and blew a kiss to the camera. “me saying goodbye to him bc i wasn’t his #1 streamed artist,” she wrote on a post published on August 29, 2024. The comments were full of “he’ll be that me EX-presso 😤” and “barry you better have ur girl on repeat or else,” not to mention “that truly was short n sweet.” But seemingly the post was a joke. 

 









Not hugely active on social media, Keoghan subtly shut down the breakup rumors in his own way. Shortly after the speculation began, the Saltburn actor liked one of Carpenter’s recent Instagram posts: a photo of her kneeling in blue lingerie for the cover of her new Short n’ Sweet Bonus Track LP.
This rather quiet interaction isn’t the only indication that things might still be going strong between the two. Sabrina still has a clip from her music video for “Please Please Please” pinned to the top of her Instagram account. Notably, this video stars Barry as her love interest.
