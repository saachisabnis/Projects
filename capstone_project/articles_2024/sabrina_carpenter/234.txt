	A pair of summer music festivals have new headliners. Tyler, the Creator has canceled his shows at Lollapalooza in Chicago and Outside Lands in San Francisco, replaced by Megan Thee Stallion and Sabrina Carpenter, respectively.

	Separately, singer and actress Carpenter announced her Short n‚Äô Sweet Tour, which will hit more than two dozen North American cities in the fall.

	‚Äúi hate saying this but i have to cancel lollapalooza and outside lands,‚Äù Tyler, the Creator wrote on X/Twitter today. ‚Äúi made a commitment that i can no longer keep, and that bums me out knowing how excited folks were. that is not sexy at all. please please forgive me or call me names when you see me in person. love.‚Äù

	The Odd Future alum had headlined both festivals in 2021 and was set to co-headline Night 1 of Lollapalooza on Thursday, August 1, at Grant Park and Night 2 of Outside Lands on Saturday, August 10, in Golden Gate Park. Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion is stepping into the Lollapalooza spotlight two weeks after her Hot Girl Summer Tour is set to wrap with a headline gig at the Broccoli City Festival in Washington, D.C.
