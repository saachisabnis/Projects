Good 4 her, if I'm honest.
Olivia Rodrigo is no stranger to absolutely devouring the MTV VMA red carpet and stage, but sadly she couldn't make it to the 2024 ceremony. Her 'GUTS' World Tour is currently in full swing, with its next show in Bangkok, Thailand later this week — so it's understandable that she wasn't able to squeeze in a trip to NYC where the awards are held. 
While Olivia didn't attend this year, she was nominated for several awards. Ready? Okay! First up she's in the Best Pop category along with Camila Cabello, Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter, Tate McRae, and Taylor Swift. Her video for 'obsessed' is also nominated for Best Cinematography, while 'bad idea right?' has secured a Best Art Direction nom, and 'get him back!' is nominated for Best Visual Effects.
Besides killing it on tour, Olivia also recently hard launched her relationship with Louis Patridge at the Venice Film Festival. 
These two have been dating for about a year, and last October a source told The Sun that "They met through mutual pals earlier in the year and have been messaging quite a bit. She has spent a few days in the capital hanging out with them all but it’s been Louis who she has been inseparable from. They have been for dinners and nights out. They hit a club together on Friday night and were acting very coupley. It’s really sweet to see her happy."
