During a new interview on CBS News Sunday Morning, Sabrina Carpenter praised Taylor Swift and the “graceful” way she handles her fame. Carpenter was an opening act on The Eras Tour earlier this year, and she revealed that Swift has been “very supportive of me and knows who I am as a person. So I’m grateful for that.” Swift is one of Carpenter’s role models for how to deal with pop superstardom. “You just watch her, like, walk in a room and it’s very easy to understand that she’s so composed, she’s graceful, she’s gracious,” Carpenter said. Having a No. 1 album and three Top 10 songs brings attention that Carpenter is still learning to navigate. “You just kind of have to exist and figure out what you can handle and what you don’t want to deal with,” Carpenter admits. “I really do think that you find the people that you surround yourself with that make you feel safe and go from there.” (Rolling Stone)
