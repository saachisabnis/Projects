Taylor Swift is sharing some love for fellow pop star Sabrina Carpenter! The 34-year-old superstar took to Instagram to reflect on her recent three-night stop in New Orleans for The Eras Tour, where 25-year-old Sabrina made a surprise appearance on stage.
On Saturday, October 26, Sabrina joined Taylor for a special acoustic set, much to the delight of fans. Together, they performed “Espresso,” worked in a mashup of “Is It Over Now?” and even added a bit of “Please Please Please” to the set. The crowd went wild over the unexpected duet.
Taylor couldn’t wait to recap the special weekend. “Wow, New Orleans. I’m still smiling thinking about that wonderful weekend,” she began on Instagram. “The city really welcomed us with open arms (with friendship bracelets on those metaphorical arms) and celebrated the tour with such flare.”
Reflecting on the unforgettable surprise performance, Taylor praised Sabrina’s dedication. “One of the things I’ll always remember from this weekend was getting to surprise the crowd with a performance by the pop princess of our dreams: @sabrinacarpenter,” she wrote. “Side note: She had one day off from her very exhaustive tour schedule. Her show is physically full on and spectacular, and she could’ve been resting in her time off. One of the reasons I respect her so much is that she does things like this, goes out of her way to give fans a surprise moment they didn’t expect. She’s as real as they come and I’m so thankful she did that for us.”
Taylor’s appreciation for Sabrina’s energy and commitment was clear. She wrapped up her post with a shout-out to everyone who attended. “Thank you to every one of those beautiful faces I got to see on 3 magical nights in Louisiana,” Taylor added.
Sabrina also posted a heartfelt message on her own Instagram to express her gratitude to Taylor. “Only stage I’d ever wanna see on a day off !!!!” Sabrina wrote. “Thank you for working late, thank you for being a singer and thank you for having me🤍 @taylorswift I love you!!”
The lovefest between these two artists left fans even more thrilled, especially as Taylor’s Eras Tour continues to pull off one surprise after another. For fans in New Orleans, this was one unforgettable night, and for Taylor and Sabrina, it was a reminder of the bond they share—and of their mutual dedication to creating memorable moments for their fans.
