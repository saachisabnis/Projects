These unexpected shoes are a serious winner 
No-one has changed the zeitgeist over the past few years quite as much as Sabrina Carpenter. 
The child star turned cool girl has been living in our heads rent-free since she dropped 'Espresso' aka theeee song of summer 2024 and quickly proceeded to release Short n' Sweet: an unapologetically raunchy album charting relationships, horniness and being a twenty-something woman. 
Naturally, her superstar ascent has been accompanied by a suitably iconic aesthetic. Specifically, Sabrina worked with stylists like Ron Hartleben and Jared Ellner to create looks inspired by retro pin-ups and old Hollywood: rocking babydolls, lingerie, camp swimsuits and more. 
Jared, in -particular, styled Sabrina across the US leg of her Short n' Sweet tour, meaning that he's the one responsible for her to-die-for custom Victoria Secret bustier covered in (*wait for it*) 150,000 hand-placed crystals. 
As Sabrina wraps up this part of her tour, Jared even posted an IG wrap-up of some of her best looks with a cute caption shouting out Sabrina's commitment to slaying: "Thank you to all of the incredible designers and craftsmen who worked so hard to bring these looks together. thank u to my team for putting your hearts into this project. and thank u sabrina for being so brilliant and serving sooo hard üçæü•Ç‚ú®"
But when Sabrina posted her own round-up from the tour, we were particularly taken by one outfit. 
Specifically, she can be seen wearing a hot pink bedazzled bustier with stockings and suspenders but, on her feet, she's rocking a seriously unexpected pair of shoes: white, flat, satin Mary Janes. While these shoes are an unusual choice (we were imagining stilettos or thigh-high boots would be more the vibe) they are kind of brilliant ‚Äì continuing the hyper-femme vibe of the overall look but likely being a lot easier to dance and perform in that high heels.
