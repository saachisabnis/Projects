Taylor Swift's Eras Tour continued its journey on Saturday night in New Orleans with the second of three total shows in Louisiana. The now 14-time Grammy winner will be touring almost non-stop for the entire year, and at each show she adds two "surprise songs" to her 44-song, three hour plus set list.

For her second night in New Orleans, Swift surprised everyone with pop star Sabrina Carpenter on stage for the acoustic portion of the show. On guitar, the duo sang Carpenter's hits "Espresso" and "Please Please Please" mixed with Swift's  "Now That We Don't Talk" from 1989 (Taylor's Version). On piano, Swift went with a mashup of "Hits Different" from Midnights (The Til Dawn Edition) and "Welcome To New York" from 1989. 
Next up, Swift has one more show in New Orleans before heading to Indianapolis.
