Sabrina Carpenter is going on tour, cause she's a singer.
The "Espresso" singer took to social media on Thursday (June 20) to announce that she is bringing her Short n' Sweet Tour to cities around North America this fall, with special guests Amaarae, Declan McKenna and Griff on select dates. The tour will kick off in September with a show in Columbus, Ohio, before she travels around the U.S. and to a few cities in Canada and wraps up in Los Angeles in November. 
"I can't wait to be singing with you all soon ðŸ’‹ :')" she wrote in the caption.
The tour will follow the release of her upcoming album Short n' Sweet, which drops August 23 and features previous singles "Espresso" and "Please, Please, Please," the latter of which has music video featuring Carpenter's boyfriend Barry Keoghan.
Pre-sale for the tour starts Tuesday, June 25, at 10 a.m. local time. Here are all the dates currently announced:
