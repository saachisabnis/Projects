Gomez has openly expressed her enthusiasm for being part of this groundbreaking and emotionally charged film. In a heartfelt interview, she shared her overwhelming joy upon receiving the news of being offered the role, highlighting the significance of the project and its impact on her.
"When I read it, I thought it was wild," said Gomez in an interview with Deadline. "I thought it was beautiful. I cried and when I did the audition, Jacques didn't know much about me, which I really appreciated because I feel as if he could see me as a blank canvas."
"And he really allowed me to help mold this character. I'm so deeply appreciative and honored to be a part of such a beautiful movie."
