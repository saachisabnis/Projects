Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” buzzes to No. 1 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart and Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” launches atop the Billboard Global 200. The songs mark each act’s first leader on the respective rankings.

	The Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	










	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

	Carpenter’s “Espresso” shoots 3-1 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart, with 59.6 million streams (up 7%) and sold 3,000 (up 15%) outside the U.S. May 3-9. The track previously became the first top 10 on the list for the Pennsylvania-born singer-songwriter and actress.

	As previously reported, “Espresso” adds a second week atop the Official UK Singles Chart, where it also became Carpenter’s first No. 1.

	Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” rises 5-2 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart, after eight nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 starting in February; Artemas’ “I Like the Way You Kiss Me” slips 2-3, after a frame at No. 1 three weeks earlier; FloyyMenor and Cris Mj’s “Gata Only” holds at No. 4, after reaching No. 3; and Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, falls to No. 5 after spending its first two weeks on the chart at No. 1.

	Concurrently, Lamar’s “Not Like Us” bounds onto the Global 200 at No. 1 with 108 million streams and 17,000 sold worldwide following its release late Sunday, May 5 (after the May 3 start of the latest charts’ tracking week). The song is one of multiple diss tracks volleyed between Lamar and Drake amid, as previously analyzed, a battle that heightened with the release of Future, Metro Boomin and Lamar’s track “Like That,” which topped the Global 200 upon its debut in early April.

	










	Notably, the sum of 108 million global streams for “Not Like Us” marks the top weekly total among rap titles (defined as those that have hit or are eligible for Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart) since the Global 200 began. It surpasses the 96.9 million that Drake’s “Way 2 Sexy,” featuring Future and Young Thug, drew in its first week, as reflected on rankings dated Sept. 18, 2021.

	“Not Like Us” also opens at No. 9 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart, marking Lamar’s third top 10, with 37.5 million streams and 2,000 sold outside the U.S.

	Tommy Richman’s first Global 200 hit, “Million Dollar Baby,” surges 10-2 in its second week on the chart, with 93.8 million streams (up 86%) and 7,000 sold (up 63%) worldwide. It also becomes his first top 10 on Global Excl. U.S., soaring 75-8 fueled by 35.8 million streams (up 184%) outside the U.S.

	Carpenter’s “Espresso” backtracks to No. 3 from its No. 2 Global 200 high; Lamar’s “Euphoria,” released April 30, soars 18-4, with 81.5 million streams (up 120%) and 9,000 sold (up 22%) worldwide, as, thanks to that track and “Not Like Us,” he now boasts six career top 10s on the chart; and Shaboozey scores his first top five hit as “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” hops 6-5.

	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated May 18, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 14. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard’s subscription-based service.
