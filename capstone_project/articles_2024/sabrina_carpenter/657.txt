Sabrina Carpenter has had a busy year that has seen her skyrocketing fame reach new heights, but there was one specific moment that had her realizing just how far her fame has stretched throughout the year. 
The "Please Please Please" singer recently sat down with TIME for her cover story in the TIME100 Next issue and explained how hearing her name mentioned in joke told by father-son duo and Schitt's Creek co-stars Eugene and Dan Levy during their opening monologue at the 2024 Emmys in September made realize that she reached a new level of fame, per People. 
"That was probably the first time I was like, 'Oh, I'm not even there,'" she said. 
Despite the attention she has seen this year, largely thanks to catchy tunes like "Espresso" and other recent singles from her latest album Short n' Sweet, she feels ready for the success after years of hard work. 
"I feel so prepared for these moments," she said. "If I was even 17 or 18, I think I would have been way, way more nervous and intimidated."
There are still moments where Carpenter realizes how far she has made it, like when she "literally threw up" after learning she would be a musical guest on Saturday Night Live and when she performed at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards last month, which she called "another dream realized."
As of part of Carpenter's appearance in this year's TIME100 Next, she received a sweet tribute penned by pop icon Christina Aguilera, who said the singer "proves great things come in small packages."
