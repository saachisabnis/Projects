Shawn Mendes revealed that he once thought he was going to be a father in his new single, "Why Why Why," released on Friday (August 9). 
The "Summer of Love" star shared a music video, in tandem with the single release, depicting simple moments in nature with his guitar as he attempts to heal from a relationship that still haunts his thoughts. Mendes reminisces a past relationship in which he chose himself in the end, despite the connection imprinting on his heart. As each lyric proceeds, the artist reveals that, at some point in this mysterious relationship, he thought he was going to be a father, leading fans to assume an alleged pregnancy scare. 
The 26-year-old GRAMMY winner bared his soul, stating that he still felt like a kid himself and sought his mother for advice amid finding out that he might be a father. Information regarding who he sings about in the new track has yet to be unveiled. According to People, Mendes has been romantically linked to Hailey Baldwin Bieber, Camila Cabello, and Sabrina Carpenter in the past. 
As if unleashing a new single and music video in the same day isn't exciting enough, Mendes also released a second track off his highly-anticipated upcoming record titled "Isn't That Enough," highlighting the simplicity of nature always being enough, as he questions the small, simple steps he's making towards becoming a better version of himself. 
Mendes is currently preparing to release his forthcoming album, Shawn, featuring new singles "Why Why Why," and "Isn't That Enough," out this October.
