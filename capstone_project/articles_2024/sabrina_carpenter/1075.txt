Taylor Swift is celebrating her pal and Eras Tour supporting act Sabrina Carpenter as the "Espresso" singer reached an impressive milestone in her career.
Carpenter seems to be feeling all the love from her fans after selling out all dates on her upcoming Short N' Sweet North American tour, which kicks off this fall. The hitmaker took to her Instagram on Thursday (July 4) to share her gratitude to fans for their support, especially with her recent success with her hit song "Espresso" and the tour selling out. The post includes stunning photos of the "Please Please Please" singer in an aquamarine gown, an espresso-flavored ice cream collaboration with Van Leeuwen and a clip of Ice Spice calling "Espresso" the song of the summer."
"and just like that you guys sold out the entire short n' sweet tour, espresso went #1 at pop radio andddddd i slid down this slide :') thank you all so so much!!!" she wrote in the caption. "i can't wait to see you on the road."
The post also grabbed the attention of Swift, who brought Carpenter along as an opening act for several shows on the international leg of her Eras Tour earlier this year. The Folklore singer was nothing short of excitedly supportive of the Disney alum, declaring in the comments under the post that it's the "summer of Sabrina."
"SUMMER OF SABRINA AND MAY IT CONTINUE FOREVER ðŸ˜‡" Swift wrote.
Carpenter wrapped up her Eras Tour appearances in March, reflecting in an Instagram post on the "whirlwind" experience and thanking "every crowd for being so welcoming and generous to us and making some of the most impressive friendship bracelets I've ever received."
Thanking Swift directly, she wrote, "I feel so lucky to witness the magic that is you and this tour. there is truly no one like you and there never will be!"
