We know — the economic times are hard. We believe that our work in upholding the First Amendment and reporting on these changing, challenging times is more important than ever.

We need to raise $5,500 to meet our goal by April 27. If you’re able to make a contribution of any amount, your dollars will make an immediate difference in helping ensure the future of local journalism in Dallas. 

Thanks for reading the Dallas Observer.
