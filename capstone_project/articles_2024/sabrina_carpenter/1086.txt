Amid the global discussions about the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) and its significant future applications, The Beatles exemplify an ideal approach.
The Beatles have notably returned to the Grammy stage, earning nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance with their song “Now and Then.”
Interestingly, the track has been refined using AI and will compete against artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Beyoncé, setting the stage for a rather unusual Grammys moment.
On November 3, 2023, The Beatles released their final song, "Now and Then."
Of the four legendary artists in the band, only two remain. Creating their final song wasn’t easy; it had been shelved for nearly forty years.
The song was originally written and performed by John Lennon in the late 1970s.
It wasn't discovered until 1994 when Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, shared the recordings of “Now and Then” along with two other songs, “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” with the surviving members of the band Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.
Although the other two songs were released in later years, the team encountered technical difficulties in isolating and separating Lennon’s vocals from the piano.
This was necessary to achieve the clear and unclouded mix required to finish 'Now and Then.'
With the assistance of AI tools, McCartney and Starr completed the song.
In an interview with the BBC in June 2023, McCartney revealed that the song had been recreated using AI.
In 2021, McCartney and Starr collaborated with director Peter Jackson on a documentary series titled 'The Beatles: Get Back.'
The award-winning docuseries surprised audiences by restoring old band audios.
They used MAL audio technology, which the production company WingNut Films employed to de-mix the film's mono soundtrack.
According to a statement by McCartney, this technology allowed them to isolate individual instruments and vocals and separate the various voices within The Beatles' conversations.
In 2022, they asked themselves, “What else can we do with this technology?” Consequently, they utilized it to enhance the ‘Now And Then’ demo.
The technology improved the clarity of Lennon’s singing by separating it from the piano, helping to preserve the original song.
“There it was, John’s voice, crystal clear. It’s quite emotional. And we all play on it, it’s a genuine Beatles recording. In 2023 to still be working on Beatles music, and about to release a new song the public haven’t heard, I think it’s an exciting thing,” McCartney said at the time.
In the same year, McCartney and Starr set out to revive this relic of the past by incorporating Harrison’s 1995 electric and acoustic guitar recordings, adding a new drum part from Starr and bass, guitar, and piano from McCartney.
McCartney included a slide guitar solo to honor Harrison. Starr and McCartney also added their vocals to the mix.
“It was the closest we’ll ever come to having him (Lennon) back in the room, so it was very emotional for all of us. It was like John was there, you know. It’s far out,” added Starr.
A wordplay at the beginning and end of the band, ‘Now and Then,’ was released as a vinyl and cassette single alongside the band’s first song, ‘Love Me Do.’
