“Please, Please, Please” did not age well, unfortunately. 
A few months ago, celebrity gossip site, Deuxmoi, reported Barry Keoghan and Sabrina Carpenter had taken a break. They cited an off-and-on-again relationship, but the pair were shortly after pictured at a romantic dinner together.
This put worries out of the minds of fans…who have grown attached to the A-list couple. However, it turns out things have taken a turn for the worse. 
I went to sleep on Tuesday not expecting to wake up to the news that Barry Keoghan had cheated on Sabrina Carpenter with OnlyFans model and influencer, Breckie Hill. 
The news was seemingly confirmed by Hill herself on TikTok, where she reposted videos saying Barry cheated on Sabrina. 
Gymnast and influencer, Olivia Dunne, also took a moment to poke shade at the situation. Dunne and Hill have infamously feuded for years now, but added fuel to the flames by saying “When her true colors are finally revealed in the national media.” 
I just sit back and laugh
In a comment, she clarifies that she’s not talking about Sabrina, but the girl who “homewrecked” her relationship, indicating Hill. 
Saltburn’s Keoghan and rising star Carpenter were together for a short year, but they made their mark as an “It Couple” for a while. Keoghan starred in her “Please, Please, Please” video and was the inspiration for songs on her recent album like “Bed Chem.” 
In a DeuxMoi blind item, a user submits that Keoghan was “getting very cozy” with a “blonde, semi-famous influencer” while Sabrina was touring. 
While neither parties have confirmed the news themselves, it’s definitely seeming like infidelity was at play. 
A source told People that the couple decided to split in order to focus on their respective careers.
