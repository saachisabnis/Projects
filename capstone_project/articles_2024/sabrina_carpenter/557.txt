Keith Urban wowed the the late-night crowd with an impromptu banjo cover that might surprise you.
This week on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Urban stopped by to promote his new album, High. Right before leaving the show, the country star pulled out his ganjo (6-string banjo) to show everyone just how talented he is. Check out the surprise performance below.
The Aussie covered "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter, which seemed to fit his falsetto vocal perfectly, and he added his signature banjo sound to the performance.
Lots of fans in the comments agreed that this was a perfect fit.
"This man.... There is nothing he can't do. Love you Keith Urban.. why do you make every other persons song sound soooo good when u sing it," commented one fan.
"How is this man NOT entertainer of the year, EVERY YEAR!?!?" said another user.
The talented superstar also made news on the late-night stop when he shared a prank that he and the late night host pulled on his A-list wifey, Nicole Kidman.
Apparently, Kidman was chatting with someone else while holding hands with Urban. While Kidman was absorbed in another conversation, Urban asked Jimmy to slip into his seat.
Fallon slipped into his seat and slid his hand under Kidman's in place of Keith's and the actress had no clue. The Aussie actress looked back after her conversation was over and noticed Fallon was sitting in Urban's place holding her hand and was very confused.
This couple is always so fun to watch.
