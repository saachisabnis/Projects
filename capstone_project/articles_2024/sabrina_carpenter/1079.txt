 Taylor Swift is having a girls’ night out in Sydney! 

 After arriving in the Australian city ahead of her first Eras Tour concert at the Accor Stadium on Feb. 23, Swift headed out for dinner on Tuesday with fellow singer Sabrina Carpenter. 

 The pop superstar, 34, wore a black gypsy top and brown pleated skirt for the outing at Pellegrino 2000 in Sydney’s Surry Hills, finishing her look with a gold bar necklace and black belt. The “Karma” hitmaker also wore her hair in curls and sported a pink lip, a move away from her signature bold red shade.

 Meanwhile, Carpenter, 24, who is supporting Swift on her Eras Tour, added a pop of color in a red and white spotted mini dress by Bella Venice. The “Feather” singer also carried a Louis Vuitton handbag and draped a black leather jacket over her arm.

 The duo will play four dates at the Accor Stadium until Feb. 26, before heading to Singapore for the next stop of the Eras Tour on March 2. 

 Swift’s latest outing comes after she was spotted leaving Melbourne on Sunday wearing a Kansas City Chiefs cap and her diamond “TNT” tennis bracelet in tribute to her boyfriend Travis Kelce. 

 The black and white Chiefs cap had the words ‘Super Bowl Champions’ embroidered across the front, honoring Kelce’s team's victory against the San Francisco 49ers at the 2024 Super Bowl on Feb. 11.

 The musician wore the accessories while boarding a private jet out of Melbourne after completing her Eras Tour stop in the city.

 Swift celebrated wrapping her three shows at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Instagram as she thanked her thousands of fans for coming out to see her.

 "Melbourne, what do I even say to you after over 288,000 of you came and danced with us in the last 3 nights ??!" she wrote on Sunday alongside a carousel of images from the shows. "That was unforgettable. You were on another LEVEL. Thank you for the memories. I’ll revisit the ones from this weekend often 🥲🫶."
