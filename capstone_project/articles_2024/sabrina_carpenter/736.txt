Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” sits at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the 14th week. The crossover hit became Shaboozey’s first career No. 1 in July, and the track now has the second longest rookie reign at the top of the charts in history, behind only the 19-week run by Lil Nas X’s 2019 debut, “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus). Sabrina Carpenter again places three songs in the Top 10 for a seventh consecutive week, as “Espresso” jumps up one spot to No. 4, “Taste” moves up two slots to No. 7, and “Please Please Please” moves up one spot to No. 9. Elsewhere in the Billboard Top 10, Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” stays at No. 2, Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, moves up a slot to No. 3, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” jumps up one spot to No. 5, Chappell Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!” slides up one to No. 6, Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” sticks at No. 8, and Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” moves up two spots to No. 10.
