2024, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni shocked Hollywood with a legal battle following their film It Ends With Us. Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and a smear campaign, leading to his dismissal by his talent agency. Despite the film’s $350 million box-office success, the allegations overshadowed its release and sparked industry-wide discussions about misconduct.
The drama intensified when Baldoni’s former publicist also sued him for defamation and breach of contract. Lively received widespread support from peers, including It Ends With Us author Colleen Hoover, and advocacy groups like SAG-AFTRA. The case became a defining moment, making headlines as one of 2024’s biggest celebrity stories.
