Please, please, please, don’t send him backlash.
Sabrina Carpenter is defending Jack Antonoff from those who claim his production style is ruining their favorite artists’ music.
We already knew Jack co-wrote and produced her latest hit single, “Please Please Please,” but in a new interview with Rolling Stone, Sabrina revealed he worked on about half of her upcoming sixth studio album, Short N’ Sweet.
Sabrina had a message for Jack’s critics who claim his monotonous production style has ruined artists like Taylor Swift, Lorde and Lana Del Rey.
“F*** them all,” Sabrina said of those critics. “I think he’s one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. When he’s in a room, he’s able to literally touch every instrument in the room and make it sound magical. He also works very fast, which I really appreciate because I work very fast.”
Sabrina recalled meeting Jack for the first time outside of a comedy club in New York City a couple of years ago. “I was peeing my pants because I wanted to work with him for my whole life,” Sabrina said. “After that, we, luckily enough, became friends; personalities meshed, and it was only a matter of time. He heard some of the stuff that I was working on for this album, and we just started to make magic.”
Short N’ Sweet arrives on Aug. 23.
