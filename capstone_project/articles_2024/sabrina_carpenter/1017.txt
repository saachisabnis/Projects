As a beauty writer, I'm fortunate to sample a range of skincare products, but one gem has stayed in my thoughts since I first tried it in a beauty bundle last year: ESPA's Overnight Hydration Therapy. Currently, it's available for 30% less on Amazon, priced at just £27.30, down from £39, making now the perfect time to incorporate this hydrating hero into your nightly regimen.
When I initially experienced this sumptuous treatment during the previous winter, it made a lasting impression. Crafted to provide deep moisture as you slumber, the cream left my skin feeling supple, nourished, and exceptionally smooth.
However, what really distinguishes ESPA's concoction is is its ability to transform my bedtime routine into a calming ritual. Its combination of lavender and ylang-ylang essential oils creates an irresistible home spa experience, reports the Liverpool Echo.

So, it wasn't only my complexion that benefited; the tranquil fragrance also contributed to my relaxation at the end of a hectic day, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep. That's quite an achievement for a night cream.
And it's not just me who thinks so; the overnight hydration therapy cream boasts impressive ratings of 4.5 stars on Amazon and 4.6 stars on John Lewis. A glowing five-star review on Amazon reads: "I use once a week overnight (and it) leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. A little goes a long way. It takes a while to work into the skin, but it's beautiful, and I highly recommend it."
A second person commented: "The cream looks like a face mask until absorbed into the skin. Next day, (I had) soft skin." They continued: "I also like the fragrance."
Meanwhile, an enthusiastic customer exclaimed at John Lewis: "This is the one product I wouldn't be without. It's really moisturising, and a little goes a long way. I'd say one jar has lasted me about six months. You wake up with your skin feeling perfect."
While there are no negative reviews on Amazon, a John Lewis customer did express dissatisfaction, noting that the product "just sat on the surface of my skin and remained very sticky to the touch". They elaborated: "I still had residue the following morning. I tried a number of times with varying amounts of product but always had the same result."
However, for those looking for an overnight treatment that also serves as a soothing self-care ritual, ESPA's Overnight Hydration Therapy could be the answer. It's available on Amazon here, but act swiftly if interested, as the discount won't last forever.
Alternatively, Liz Earle's £43 superskin overnight mask is a hit with shoppers for being "wonderfully creamy and nourishing". Paula's Choice is also an excellent pick for overnight skincare; its super hydrate overnight mask is designed to provide long-lasting hydration for all skin types.
