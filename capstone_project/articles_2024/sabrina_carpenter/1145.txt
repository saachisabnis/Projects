Sabrina Carpenter is feeling very thankful at the close of the North American leg of her "Short n' Sweet" tour!
She took to Instagram writing, "That’s a wrap on the North American leg of the Short n’ Sweet tour!!!!! I have always dreamt of bringing this tour to life but it was even better than i could have imagined because of every crowd that showed up and gave 100% of their energy and time… cry because it’s over for now… but we can’t wait to see you in the new year Europe."
