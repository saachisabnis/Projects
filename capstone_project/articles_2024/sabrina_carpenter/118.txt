Life doesn’t exactly imitate art for Barry Keoghan.
The Saltburn star shared that his unconventional relationship with his 2-year-old son Brando—who he shares with ex Alyson Kierans—made it hard for him to draw on personal experience when preparing for on-screen fatherhood in his new drama, Bird.
“I didn’t have a father figure growing up, so even my relationship with my son isn’t quite of the normal father-son relationship,” Keoghan, 31, told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published Sept. 12, “because I don’t have that figure to draw experience from and to base it on. Love, you don’t need anything to draw from, love is pure, and so I’m not on about that, but I’m on about little stuff like teaching your son this or teaching your daughter that.”
So when it came to getting into character, the Oscar-nominated actor—who went public with his romance with Sabrina Carpenter in February 2024—took a more unusual approach.
