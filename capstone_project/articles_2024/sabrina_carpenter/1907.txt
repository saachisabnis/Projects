While many things are constants at Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concerts, from her adoring fans to her calculated choreography, one aspect remains ever-changing: her surprise songs. 
Swifties eagerly await the acoustic section of every tour stop, where the popstar picks random songs to play live on the guitar and piano. The built-up excitement and anticipation around which songs she would chose was no different in New Orleans, where Swift took the stage at the Caesars Superdome for three nights during the last leg of her record-breaking tour. 
Adding to the surprise song hype, Swift began performing mash-ups of her songs while on the tour in Europe, giving fans the chance hear her perform even more of their favorites. 
In the Crescent City, Swift's song choices spanned seven of her 11 albums and even included a song by another artist. 
Her night one choices paid tribute to her history with touring in Louisiana, highlighting a song from her very first album that she released in 2006 when she was 16. 
But arguably the most exciting surprise song set was on night two, when Swift called up Sabrina Carpenter to join her in performing two songs off the singer's new album "Short N' Sweet," "Espresso" and "Please, Please, Please."
Meanwhile, on night three, Swift used the time to highlight her 1989 album on the 10 year anniversary of its release. 
Here's a full list of surprise songs that Taylor sang in New Orleans.
