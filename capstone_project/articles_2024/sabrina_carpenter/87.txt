“BBC, I wish I had it in me” Carpenter adlibbed during her set at Radio 1 Big Weekend
Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the BBC after she was allegedly told to keep her performance “PG” at their Radio 1’s Big Weekend 2024 festival, which took place on Sunday (May 26) at Stockwood Park, Luton.
During the outro of her single ‘Nonsense’, Carpenter adlibbed by mentioning BBC by name: “BBC said I should keep it PG / BBC I wish I had it in me”, during which she gestured with her hand before singing “There’s a double meaning if you dig deep” and blowing a kiss to the crowd.

This is likely in reference to her performance of the song on BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge in 2023, where she riffed during the outro: “How quickly can you take your clothes off, pop quiz / I’m American I am not British, so BBC it stands for something different / This live lounge is so lit because I’m in it, innit.”
According to Deadline, the clip of her performance on YouTube originally featured the line before being taken down and re-uploaded without it. In the US, BBC is a term used to describe a specific subgenre of pornography. Charli XCX responded to Carpenter’s 2023 performance, tweeting “sabrina carpenter explaining bbc on the bbc is so funny i can’t”.
This time, BBC uploaded her performance of ‘Espresso’ on YouTube, where she thanked fans for keeping the song atop the UK Singles Chart, where it has stayed at Number One for an entire month. Last week (May 24), it stayed in its position and beat Billie Eilish’s ‘LUNCH’.
“What the hell was that about, you guys?” she said in a tongue-in-cheek intro. “I was really concerned because I was like, ‘Surely the UK only drinks tea. They would never drink Espresso.’”
During their headline set at the festival, Coldplay brought out Carpenter to sing ‘Magic’. Prior to that performance, Chris Martin sang “that’s that me espresso” at the end of Coldplay’s hit ‘Fix You’ in reference to Carpenter’s single.
‘Espresso’ has also gained a fan in Adele, who hailed it as “my jam” and that she found herself singing the song while getting into bed. Carpenter responded with a tweet: “All i read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.”
