“When I was growing up, I loved to do covers of songs, that’s what made me want to write songs,” Carpenter said as she introduced Jones, “and my mom, in particular, introduced me to this song when I was seven. It’s one of my favorites. I just thought it’d be so, so cool for Norah Jones to come out here to Coachella and sing ‘Don’t Know Why’ with me.”

The 2024 festival marks the first time Carpenter has performed at the annual event, something she celebrated with the crowd frequently throughout her set.
During Weekend 1, she debuted her new single, “Espresso,” which she performed again for Weekend 2’s crowd, pleasing social media influencer Emma Chamberlain who held a sign begging Carpenter to play it.

One of the most talked about moments from every Sabrina Carpenter performance is her viral “Nonsense” outro, during which she freestyles her lyrics to reflect the venue or city that she’s in. During her Weekend 2 outro, the singer made a bold declaration with her closing lines: “Coachella, see you back here when I headline.”
