Sabrina Carpenter knows people are interested in her dating life, but she doesn't feel the need to explain her relationships.
The "Espresso" singer shared her thoughts on the public's fascination with her relationships in a new cover story with W Magazine that was published Thursday (September 5). During the chat, she revealed that, instead of speaking openly about her relationships, she would much rather have people hear what she has to say through her music, per People. 
"I get why people are interested," she said. "But they can listen to my album and decide for themselves what the songs are about."
Carpenter has been romantically linked to Saltburn actor Barry Keoghan since December 2023 and he even had a starring role in the music video for her song "Please Please Please," the lyrics of which he reportedly had a sweet reaction to. However, it was reported last month that the pair were "on and off."
Last week, Carpenter's rumored beau seemingly shut down breakup rumors after leaving a cheeky comment in relation to the hilariously gory music video for her latest single "Taste," off her new album Short n' Sweet. 
While she doesn't want to discuss the exact details of her relationships, she did open up about her "messy" and "fun" approach to dating earlier this year, revealing some of the qualities that she is "super attracted" to.
