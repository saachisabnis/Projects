Karma is two icons reuniting and absolutely serving.
Last night, one of our absolute fave collaborators and friends Taylor Swift and Ice Spice were nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for their track "Karma" at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Despite not taking home the trophy, however, the celebs truly could not have been more pumped about simply being at the awards ceremony and seeing each other.
And the two seemed to share their excitement with tons of other A-listers, including Jon Batiste, Sabrina Carpenter, and Jack Antanoff in an iconic after party moment that has since gone viral. Ahem:
Back in July 2023, Ice Spice chatted about how her "Karma" collab came to be and dished to Billboard the following *chef's kiss* anecdote: "I was home and my manager called me, and was like, ‚ÄòOh, Taylor wants you on a record.' And I‚Äôm like, 'Taylor?' I was having a really bad day also, I would like to say that. I was having a terrible day. I was crying all morning because I was just so mad at something. And then he called me with that news. And then I cried more, because it was good news. My life is a rollercoaster. How I started the day crying and I‚Äôm ending it crying, but for different reasons."
The musician then added that, "We went to the studio and [Taylor] is so humble and so nice. I kid you not. I pulled up to the studio and she outside waiting for me. So she‚Äôs great. She‚Äôs so funny. We text all the time. She is fucking hilarious. I‚Äôm not going to lie. She‚Äôs the funniest person ever."
Meanwhile, Taylor told Spotify that getting to know Ice Spice has "been so special because I‚Äôm blown away by her. She is, in my opinion, she is the one to watch. Just watching her work ethic and how thoughtfully she approaches her career. She‚Äôs, like, my new favorite artist and I‚Äôm so honored that she‚Äôs on the song."
Truly living for this friendship duo and a hundred percent manifesting another collab in the works. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
