C’est fini! Vogue World: Paris has wrapped, and here’s a shoppable breakdown of the best fashion and trend moments from the spectacle, from Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner’s unforgettable catwalk entrance on horseback to turns from FKA twigs, Karlie Kloss, Sabrina Carpenter, Venus and Serena Williams, and more. The event served as a celebration of fashion and sport, a look back at 10 decades and present-day French fashion alongside the best in summer sportswear, from cycling and swimming to tennis and gymnastics. All the sports and decades proved equally stylish.
The runway itself—which unfolded in the famed Place Vendôme, surrounded by haute couture ateliers at the center of the 1st Arrondissement in Paris—was chock-full of pieces from iconic French houses like Chanel, Dior, Saint Laurent, Alaïa, Balenciaga, and Givenchy. Styled by Ib Kamara and Carine Roitfeld, the fashion show gave us a cheat sheet for what’s important now in fashion—which can be distilled into six trends.
For summer, there’s a handful of takeaways. To start, Jacquemus has declared this summer the season of stripes. In an ode to the 1940s, we saw colorful striped dresses from Jacquemus and bikinis from Jean Paul Gaultier. Speaking of color, richly hued chiffon capes and flowing gowns kicked off the 1970s section, featuring pieces from Givenchy, Alexandre Vauthier, Giambattista Valli, and the new Chloé by Chemena Kamali in wonderfully saturated shades that are most welcome for high summer.
Looking ahead, take a cue from houses like Dior and Hermès, and you’ll see that it’s going to be a horse-girl fall. Blazers and riding jackets with nipped-in waists nod to the 1950s, and a resurgence of these silhouettes was seen on fall 2024 runways, from Thom Browne to Maison Margiela couture; complete the look with a full skirt and pair of riding boots. All that and more standout trends to shop from Vogue World: Paris, below.

The worlds of fashion and equestrianism have always been intertwined; it’s no secret that many women in the industry are riders (Bella Hadid, Edie Campbell, and Mary-Kate Olsen, to name a few). What better way to honor that history than with pieces from the French fashion houses of Dior and Hermès? The silhouettes on the runway resembled those of the 1950s, with nipped-in blazers and full skirts. Here’s how to do it for fall 2024.
