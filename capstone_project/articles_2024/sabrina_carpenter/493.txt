Die-hard Strictly Come Dancing fans think one couple has an advantage over the others - and it is not fair. Strictly Come Dancing viewers have taken to social media to claim that Tasha Ghouri's performance was 'unfair'.
Strictly's Tasha Ghouri has faced allegations of a "fix" due to her professional dance experience prior to the show. On Saturday, she and Aljaz Skorjanec rocketed to second place on the leaderboard with their cha cha to "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter, scoring an admirable 30 points, tying with Sarah Hadland and Vito Coppola.
Fans have raised questions over fairness as Tasha had dance training before joining the BBC contest. Disgruntled viewers took to social media to air their opinions: "Tasha getting all high scores but sure she's a professional dancer, bit unfair," commented one.

Another remarked, "Isn't Tasha Ghouri a professional dancer? Wasn't that a thing when she was in Love Island? " and yet another stated, "I love tasha but she isn't meant to be on the show because she is already a PROFESSIONAL DANCER."
Conversely, supporters defend her, pointing out: "shes not ballroom or latin trained though, there are multiple 'trained' dancers on the show" The judges were thrilled with the routine, lauding her for picking up the skill so rapidly, with Craig Revel Horwood and Motsi Mabuse awarding the duo 8s in week one. Motsi Mabuse cheered, "What a way to introduce yourself! " and advised her to maintain the momentum.
Shirley Ballas praised Tasha's potential for incredible leg action but added a caveat: "You're on your way to have one of the most spectacular leg actions I've ever seen on the show," although admitting they had not fully arrived there yet.
Tasha, who trained in commercial dance at the Creative Academy in Slough and later took part in dance competitions before her stint on Love Island, has opened up about the transition to ballroom and Latin for her appearance on the show. She explained to The Independent, "Commercial dance is very different to ballroom dance and latin, I'm still having to strip down and relearn, even walking in cha cha step is weird to me you have to turn out your feet and lead with your hips, so it's based on muscle memory," and admitted, "Even letting a man take the lead is a lot."
Judges were impressed with her performance; Anton Du Beke described them as "absolutely fabulous" and noted Aljaz Skorjanec's evident enthusiasm now that he's returned to the dance floor.
Craig Revel Horwood also praised Aljaz's comeback, remarking that they "slay, slay, slayed" their routine.
Despite their efforts, Tasha and her partner were just edged out of the top spot by JB Gill and Amy Dowden, who scored 31 points with their waltz to Leo Sayer's "When I Need You," leaving the audience in awe.
