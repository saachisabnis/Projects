WRAL is reporting a closure on Hillsborough Street in both directions at I-440 in west Raleigh because of a gas leak, causing a traffic headache for those heading to the North Carolina State Fair on Tuesday (Oct. 22).
Before 9:30 a.m., the road between Beryl Road and Blue Ridge Road near the fairgrounds was closed. I-440 between Western Boulevard and Wade Avenue was also closed.
The leak was caused by a damaged gas line. An Enbridge Gas spokesperson said that their team hopes to secure the leak by sometime Tuesday afternoon. So far, no word on possible injuries.
This marks the latest traffic issue since the start of the NC State Fair this year. On Saturday, congestion was persistent throughout the afternoon as both fairgoers and those heading to Lenovo Center to check out pop singer Sabrina Carpenter ran into traffic and parking issues. The ongoing construction on Blue Ridge Road has also slowed traffic in recent years. The project should be completed in time for the 2025 state fair.
In the meantime, drivers can take Trinity Road, Wade Avenue, and Edwards Mill Road to navigate around the closure.
