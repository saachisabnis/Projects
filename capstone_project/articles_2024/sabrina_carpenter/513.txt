It is with sadness that we note the sudden passing of noted studio potter Reid Ozaki in July, 2024 of a heart attack. He was 73. Originally from Hilo, Hawai’i, he came to the Northwest to study at the University of Puget Sound where he fell in love with ceramics. He taught for years at Tacoma Community College and was instrumental in providing a pillar of knowledge and tradition for the Northwest ceramic community. He nurtured the local ceramic community by starting the Tacoma Pottery Studio with fellow ceramicist Kristina Batiste where local artisans could gather, do their work and trade stories. He felt strongly that the rich local history of Northwest ceramics needed to be preserved and passed on. In his own work using soda-fired and wood-fired processes, he created pieces with a natural organic quality no doubt influenced by his childhood by the natural environment and seascape of his native Hawai’i. As he would say in an interview on the CANVAS REBEL website, “My ceramic vessels are informed by my interest in and love for the natural world and the aesthetics of the Japanese Tea ceremony. My work endeavors to synthesize this aesthetic with Western techniques and materials.” A program on him will make its debut on Brangien Davis’s PBS Cascade video series “Art By Northwest” on August 25, 2024 and later stream. Some of his work can be seen at Bainbridge Arts & Crafts on Bainbridge Island. Besides his active involvement with Tacoma Pottery Studio, he was also involved with curating a show of work by ceramic artists from Hawai’i for KOBO at Higo in Seattle at the time of his passing. His presence in the Northwest ceramic community will be sorely missed.
