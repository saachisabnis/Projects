Sabrina Carpenter and Christina Aguilera joined forces at the "Espresso" hitmaker's Los Angeles Short N' Sweet tour stop at Crypto.com Arena on Friday (November 15), and fans could hardly believe their eyes! 
Video footage captured by Pop Crave shows the "Genie In A Bottle" icon walking out on stage as the crowd (and Carpenter) screamed in sheer surprise. The "Beautiful" songstress took center stage in a jaw-dropping, black ensemble with shiny, silver, thigh-high boots as she belted, "Ain't No Other Man." 
Carpenter, dressed in a similar black, lace look, made her way to the front of the arena where she joined Aguilera in song and the two effortlessly serenaded the crowd with the 2006 track. 
Aguilera posted a series of photos from the performance to Instagram that perfectly encapsulated her sweet friendship with Carpenter, including the sign that surprised the 25-year-old, and a few snaps of them slaying the stage together. The "Please Please Please" standout also shared a carousel of photos from her L.A. set, referring to the event as a night she'll "never forget." 
This is not the first time the blonde bombshells have surprised fans with a fabulous collaboration. In September, the beloved artists posted an Instagram reel together, teasing a possible collab that turned into an anniversary spotlight! On October 2, Carpenter helped Aguilera celebrate the 25-year anniversary of her self-titled album with a joint "What a Girl Wants" cover.
