xtinaâ€™s debut song, genie in a bottle, was released the same day sabrina was born and now sheâ€™s featured on the 25th anniversary live album like thats mother and daughter pic.twitter.com/E7gEyxEviN
The other 4 songs on her new live EP are: Come On Over, Obvious, I Turn To You, and Reflection.
This is going to be amazing! Sabrina Carpenter and Christina Aguilera together? A fresh take on "What A Girl Wants" is exactly what we need. Can't wait to hear their voices blend on such a classic.
Even better than I imagined ðŸ˜­
