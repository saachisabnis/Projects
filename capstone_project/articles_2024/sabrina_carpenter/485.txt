To say 2024 was an eventful year of ups and downs would be an understatement. I've always found interesting to see what the most important events, songs and general searches.
Every year Google Trends releases top searches by zip code, which spit out data from the metro areas of Portland and Auburn. At the time of this article, I was only able track down top searches in a few specific categories. Here's what our little corner of the country was most obsessed with in 2024.
1. Eclipse glasses near me
Yeah, that one doesn't surprise me too much. Remember? It seems like just yesterday everyone was scrambling to get their hands on a pair of these. What did surprise me a bit was the rest of the top 5. Mainers were clearly obsessed with their phones. And Drive-in movies over restaurants? I respect your curveballs, Maine.
2. Prepaid phones near me
3. Phone deals near me
4. Drive in movie near me
5. Restaurants near me open now 
1. Espresso - Sabrina Carpenter
Again, not surprised by this one. Don't know it? Yeah you do, trust me, it was everywhere this year. The rest of the top 5 seemed to be pretty on par as well.
2. Good Luck, Babe! - Chappell Roan
3. Houdini - Eminem
4. Pink Skies - Zack Bryan
5. Thick Of It - KSI
1. Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul
I think I missed this one. Oh wait... so did everyone else. Despite all the hype around 58-year-old Mike Tyson stepping back into the ring to fight young buck Jake Paul, Mainers—and most of the world—were let down thanks to Netflix's technical difficulties. Turns out, we didn’t miss much.
2. Dallas Mavericks vs Boston Celtics
3. Baltimore Ravens vs Kansas City Chiefs
4. Michigan Wolverines vs Washington Huskies
5. Edmonton Oilers vs Pittsburg Panthers
I, for sure, expected to see Trump/Vance vs Harris/Walz on this list but then I realized, they were referring to a different type of "match."
