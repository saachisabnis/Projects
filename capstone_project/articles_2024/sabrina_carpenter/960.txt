	The performance wraps up an exciting year for Kravitz who dropped his 12th studio album, Blue Electric Light, back in May via Roxie Records/BMG. The project was written and recorded by Kravitz in his studio in the Bahamas, and features the singles “Paralyzed,” “TK421” and “Human.” The collection, he told Jimmy Fallon for a late-night interview that aired in March, is about “celebration, life, humanity, sexuality, sensuality, spirituality.” Blue Electric Light is “just that vibration of love, of god, of spirit.”
