Barry Keoghan has nothing but supportive things to say about girlfriend Sabrina Carpenter and her music. 
The "Espresso" songstress recently sat down with Variety to discuss advice she's received from bestie Taylor Swift, how it feels to be a chart-topping artist, and of course, Keoghan (who was featured in her latest music video) and his opinion on her lyrics. Referring to summer smash hit "Please Please Please," Carpenter shared that Keoghan was all for the lyrics, and that she was all for his acting. 
"He loved the song. He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that. I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation. So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special."
The music video, existing as a hard launch of the beloved power couple's relationship, was released in June, and the single rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that same month. Carpenter and Keoghan pack on the PDA as the story of "Please Please Please" is told through iconic visuals, highlighting the unity of rebellious con man and a lover girl who wants her partner to give up his ways and feel complete with her affection to avoid embarrassment in the long run. 
Carpenter is gearing up to release her highly-anticipated album, Short n' Sweet, featuring previously released tracks, "Please Please Please," and "Espresso," in addition to unreleased singles, "Good Graces," "Sharpest Tool," "Coincidence," "Bed Chem," "Dumb & Poetic," "Slim Pickins (which she debuted at the GRAMMY Museum earlier this week)," "Juno," "Lie To Girls," and "Don't Smile."
