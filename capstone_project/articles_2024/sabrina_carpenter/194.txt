When Taylor Swift comes to town, celebrities will follow. 
The Caesars Superdome was filled with A-listers and Swift's inner-tribe for all three nights of The Eras Tour in New Orleans. 
They sat in VIP and traded friendship bracelets, took selfies with Swifties and danced and sang the night away. A few even made TikTok videos from the floor of the Dome. 
The final night of Swift's New Orleans shows were just as star-studded as the two shows before it.
Taylor Swift's parents, Scott and Andrea Swift, were there to watch their daughter. Andrea was also spotted on Friday night, when Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and "Hunger Games" star Josh Hutcherson were there. Camilla Luddington from "Grey's Anatomy" was also there Friday, and "Good Morning America" co-host Robin Roberts came Saturday.
Chris Olsen, a TikTok star and best friend of Meghan Trainor, also showed up Sunday. Angela Kinsey of "The Office" fame took her daughter, and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band got VIP treatment from Swift, who met them when she visited New Orleans in 2022. 
New Orleans' own Kelsey Anderson, who won her season of "The Bachelor" and is engaged to Joey Graziadei, was in the Dome Sunday in a "Reputation" era outfit. 
Swift's shows in the Crescent City sold out every single night. She shared many emotional moments with fans, and explained why she chose New Orleans for the last leg of her tour. 
The most surprising moment was when Swift brought Sabrina Carpenter out for an "Espresso" mash-up and duet on Saturday.
