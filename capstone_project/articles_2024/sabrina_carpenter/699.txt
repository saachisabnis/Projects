 Sabrina Carpenter is bidding goodbye to the Eras Tour.

 On Saturday, the "Nonsense" singer, 24, shared an Instagram post featuring some of the final photos of her run as a opening act on Taylor Swift's record-breaking world tour. One photo showed Carpenter and Swift, 34, visiting the Sydney Zoo together in Australia. They could be seen strolling alongside each other as they took in the sights.

 Other shots captured Carpenter performing onstage and cheering on her team as they prepared backstage.

 "That’s a wrap for us on the eras tour :’)," Carpenter began her lengthy caption. "Sitting at home reflecting on what a whirlwind this was and how very honored I feel to have been part of it. I want to thank every crowd for being so welcoming and generous to us and making some of the most impressive friendship bracelets I’ve ever received."

 "Also a huge thank you to the incredible crew for being so hardworking and talented," she continued. "And the most thank you’s I’ve ever thank you’d to Taylor."

 She concluded her post with a heartfelt message for Swift herself.

 "I feel so lucky to witness the magic that is you and this tour," she wrote to the 14-time Grammy winner. "There is truly no one like you and there never will be! I love you with all my heart and I will cherish this taybrina era (and all the eras) till the end of time 💞💞💞."

 Swift first revealed that the Disney Channel alum would be joining her as an opening act for the Eras Tour in June 2023. Carpenter was announced as an opener for her international dates in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, and Australia and Singapore were added in a later announcement.

 Since then, the two singers have seemingly become even closer since touring together. Earlier this month, after Carpenter had her opening act canceled as bad weather delayed one of their Sydney shows, Swift and Carpenter sang a duet of Swift's songs "White Horse" and "Coney Island" for excited fans at Accor Stadium, as they leaned against each other and swayed to the music.

 Sharing a clip of the performance on Instagram, Carpenter later thanked Swift for her support and addressed the pinch-me moment of performing the duet with the megastar. “9 year old Sabrina singing white horse would never see this s--- coming! I love you so so so dearly Taylor. Always have, always will," she wrote.

 In the same March 1 Instagram post, Carpenter nodded to her longtime love of Swift's music as she shared an old Facebook screenshot from her page in 2009 that read, “Was trying to enter a Taylor Swift contest to win tickets and a chance to meet her but they said I had to be 13.”
