Concert-goers were left stunned after Sabrina Carpenter screamed and fled the stage as pyrotechnics appeared to hit her mid-performance.
The Espresso singer is gearing up to head out on tour and has been performing her latest hit tracks at various festivals over the summer.
While atÂ Outside Lands in San Francisco, her usually carefree and cheeky set took a turn as she got a little too close to the fireworks.
Fans grew concerned as Sabrina, 25, shrieked as the stage lit up with sparks from behind her, with some suggesting a spark landed on her chest.
â€˜Oh my god,â€™ the Please Please Please hitmaker shouted and moved towards her backup dancers as the camera panned to them in a chaotic clip.
The strap of her blue glittering dress, matching her signature knee-high boots, had slipped down during the commotion.
The camera then turned to show Sabrina rushing off stage with her dancers as the fireworks continued.
Sabrina â€“ who is currently dating Irish actor Barry Keoghan â€“ did not address the mishap in her Instagram post after the event, which fans have taken to mean she is not injured.
â€˜HeadlinedÂ @outsidelandsÂ :o,â€™ she wrote. â€˜Thank you to everyone who came. special thank you to the angel that isÂ @spaceykaceyÂ for coming out to sing and dance to Nancy Sinatra with me :â€™)
â€˜And thank you to my whole team and crew. all the talented people who made this show happen on and off stage, I love you all so much.â€™

leave it to sabrina to almost get taken out by a pyro at the end of her set Ã°ÂŸÂ’Â€ #outsidelands @TeamSabrina
sheÃ¢Â€Â™s not used to having the budget for pyro Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â­
Concerned fans commented asking for more information about the fireworks debacle. 
â€˜Sabrina girl are you okay? you scared us with your screams at the end of the show with the pyrotechnics,â€™ wrote Kamire Lacole.
Leftoverplates joked: â€˜Our Polly Pocket was NOT prepared for the pyro and fireworks at the end of the show.â€™
â€˜those screams at the end of the showâ€¦ THAT WAS NOT PLANNED AT ALLðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,â€™ added username398494.
Numerous fans joked she â€˜wasnâ€™t used to the budget for pyrotechnicsâ€™, given the former Disney starâ€™s meteoric rise to fame.
Sabrina had been a relatively minor artist before her stint as an opener for Taylor Swift on the Eras Tour in South America.
Her performances of Feather began to go viral for her dances as well as her cheeky improvised outros to hit song Nonsense.
After this, Espresso hit the charts and launched her into stratospheric fame â€“ including a UK tour next year which has already caused some controversy.
Fans werenâ€™t happy that the star was charging Â£240 for â€˜nosebleedâ€™ seats for her gigs in London,Â Birmingham,Â ManchesterÂ and Glasgow.
Metro.co.uk has reached out to Sabrinaâ€™s team for comment.
