It’s just one guy! Kevin Parker’s psychedelic music project has become widely known for wobbly synths and smooth bass work. Tame Impala really took off with the release of “Lonerism” in 2012. “Currents”, the follow-up album, is what really put this act on the map. Some of his biggest hits including “The Less I Know The Better”, “Let It Happen”, and “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” all come from this LP.


This album marks a turn for Tame Impala, shifting toward more dance-based music. The lyrics throughout this project talk a lot about personal transformation and an overall period of metamorphosis. The album cover is also very widely recognized, contributing to this album’s popularity. It depicts vortex shedding, which is a principle in fluid dynamics where a fluid body takes on vortices or waves, and it moves around an object. This could represent the movement of time, and how Parker experienced obstacles that caused a change.


The highlighted track, “Nangs”, is a short track that has some sharp synths to contrast the reverb-heavy vocals.


9) Mildlife – “Chorus” 2024
This Australian psychedelic rock group takes influence from jazz to create their unique sound. The group has been making music together since 2013, with their first album, “Phase” coming out in 2017.


In their earlier work, they lean into being nonsensical while retaining elements of their musicality that were later fleshed out to create a richer sound. The band takes inspiration from acts like Tame Impala, upbeat and dancey with a bit of a rock twist.


The highlighted track, “Yourself” is dreamy and playful in both its lyrics and some syncopation throughout the song.


8) The Jesus and Mary Chain – “Glasgow Eyes” (2024)
This alt-rock band was formed by brothers Jim and William Reid, hailing from Scotland and credited with being key players in the development of shoegaze. Inspired by British acts like The Velvet Underground and Siouxsie and the Banshees the group started out scrounging for gigs. They would pretend to be a supporting band at a venue they weren’t booked at, play a quick set, and then leave. The group became controversial for their rock and roll lifestyles including violence and drug use. “Glasgow Eyes” marks the band’s first release in 7 years.


This week’s highlighted track, “Silver Strings” is eerie and mysterious. With soft vocals and plucky bass strings, the song finds its power in its restraint.


7) Rachel Chinouriri – “What A Devastating Turn of Events” (2024)
UK singer/songwriter, Rachel Chinouriri, released her debut album earlier this year. She’s been releasing music on SoundCloud since 2018 but really found her audience after gaining some traction on TikTok. Born in Zimbabwe to parents who didn’t know much about British pop culture, Chinouriri found curiosity in British music as a teenager. She was especially inspired by the music of Daughter and Lily Allen.


After her single, “So My Darling”, the singer gained notoriety for her bubble pop sounds and artistic music videos. With support from other celebrities collaborations with her. One includes the appearance of actress Florence Pugh in the music video for “Never Need Me” which debuted ahead of the release of “What A Devastating Turn of Events”. She also gained a following when it was announced that she would be a supporting leg of the European leg of Sabrina Carpenter’s upcoming “Short n’ Sweet” tour.


The Highlighted track, “I Hate Myself” is somber as it reflects on a more dour subject matter than most of the record.


6) Floral Cow – “Wasteland Disco” (2022)
Floral Cow’s sophomore EP “Wasteland Disco” is a collection of indie folk mixed with some grungy vocals. The singer/songwriter hits on moments of quiet to contrast the more intense songs. Based out of Bloomington, Indiana the musician debuted with the EP “Somewhere in Between” in 2019 leaning more toward indie than rock compared to this later project.


The highlighted track, “Champion Chariot” uses a unique chord progression to create and hazy feeling for the listener.


5) Caleb Landry Jones – “Hey Gary, Hey Dawn” (2024)
Caleb Landry Jones began releasing music in 2020 with his debut album, “The Mother Stone”. Before this, he was mostly known for his acting. You may recognize Jones from his roles in “Breaking Bad”, “X-Men: First Class”, or “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”.


Despite a successful acting career, Jones couldn’t resist stepping into the world of music where he provides his take on experimental rock while drawing inspiration from some of the giants of the past, including The Beastles.


Our highlighted track, “The Moonkey Light”, while only about a minute long, packs a punch with intensity in the instrumentation and vocal delivery.


4) Pinback – “Blue Screen Life” (2001)
Pinback marks this week’s oldest release on the list with their 2001 album, “Blue Screen Life”. Hailing from San Diego, Armistead Burwell Smith IV and Rob Crow showcase the beachier side of life. The duo gets their name from Dan O’Bannon’s character in the movie “Dark Star”, a comedic sci-fi film from 1974.


This album holds the attention of Pinback fans for being their last project before signing with a record label. Many fans appreciate the intimate feel of the band making music as friends and this album draws upon that sound.


Our highlighted track, “Talby” has a hypnotic quality with its somber guitar loops and ambient vocals.


3) Miranda Hardy – “The Price of Happiness” (2024)
Originally pursuing a career in advertising, Miranda Hardy began professional songwriting to take after her dad, Jack Hardy. She was inspired by being at shows with him as a child and decided it was time to take her turn with a pen and guitar.


The singer’s sophomore album is her take on the choices and challenges of life. Making decisions and prioritizing what is important. Hardy has said that on this album she is treating her music with more seriousness while still having fun.


The highlighted track this week, “Strawberry Moon” is sweet in both its bright vocal delivery and folksy instrumentation.


2) Childish Gambino – “Atavista” (2024)
Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, started his musical career in 2011 with his album “Camp”. He was known widely as a comedian who got his start as a writer for “30 Rock” before becoming an actor. Both of us on the music team were big fans of his work in the show “Community” as Troy Barnes.


His comedy background and musical inclination explain the silly nature of his earlier work. When Gambino shifted into a more serious tone while maintaining his whimsy, he really began to shine as a musician. A good example from this album is the track “Psilocybae”, a quirky chronicle of his first time trying magic mushrooms.


This week’s highlighted track, “Final Church” is hard-hitting and reminiscent of gospel styles with the backing vocals.


1) Khal!l – “HEART: Melodies of the Eternal Flame” (2024)
R&B artist Khal!l hails from Milwaukee, where he found his love of singing by participating in his church’s choir. This led to his passion for music inspiring him to learn how to play instruments and produce music.


Khal!l takes inspiration from artists like Blood Orange, Bon Iver, and Toro y Moi. These artists are known for different things like disting melodies, omnipresent vocals, and electronic production. Khal!l fuses all of these elements together to create this latest album.


The highlighted track, “The Red Camellia” is a fun track with some imitation radio breaks, making us here at KCSU partial to it.

This week’s highlighted track, “Silver Strings” is eerie and mysterious. With soft vocals and plucky bass strings, the song finds its power in its restraint.


7) Rachel Chinouriri – “What A Devastating Turn of Events” (2024)
UK singer/songwriter, Rachel Chinouriri, released her debut album earlier this year. She’s been releasing music on SoundCloud since 2018 but really found her audience after gaining some traction on TikTok. Born in Zimbabwe to parents who didn’t know much about British pop culture, Chinouriri found curiosity in British music as a teenager. She was especially inspired by the music of Daughter and Lily Allen.


After her single, “So My Darling”, the singer gained notoriety for her bubble pop sounds and artistic music videos. With support from other celebrities collaborations with her. One includes the appearance of actress Florence Pugh in the music video for “Never Need Me” which debuted ahead of the release of “What A Devastating Turn of Events”. She also gained a following when it was announced that she would be a supporting leg of the European leg of Sabrina Carpenter’s upcoming “Short n’ Sweet” tour.


The Highlighted track, “I Hate Myself” is somber as it reflects on a more dour subject matter than most of the record.


6) Floral Cow – “Wasteland Disco” (2022)
Floral Cow’s sophomore EP “Wasteland Disco” is a collection of indie folk mixed with some grungy vocals. The singer/songwriter hits on moments of quiet to contrast the more intense songs. Based out of Bloomington, Indiana the musician debuted with the EP “Somewhere in Between” in 2019 leaning more toward indie than rock compared to this later project.


The highlighted track, “Champion Chariot” uses a unique chord progression to create and hazy feeling for the listener.


5) Caleb Landry Jones – “Hey Gary, Hey Dawn” (2024)
Caleb Landry Jones began releasing music in 2020 with his debut album, “The Mother Stone”. Before this, he was mostly known for his acting. You may recognize Jones from his roles in “Breaking Bad”, “X-Men: First Class”, or “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”.


Despite a successful acting career, Jones couldn’t resist stepping into the world of music where he provides his take on experimental rock while drawing inspiration from some of the giants of the past, including The Beastles.


Our highlighted track, “The Moonkey Light”, while only about a minute long, packs a punch with intensity in the instrumentation and vocal delivery.


4) Pinback – “Blue Screen Life” (2001)
Pinback marks this week’s oldest release on the list with their 2001 album, “Blue Screen Life”. Hailing from San Diego, Armistead Burwell Smith IV and Rob Crow showcase the beachier side of life. The duo gets their name from Dan O’Bannon’s character in the movie “Dark Star”, a comedic sci-fi film from 1974.


This album holds the attention of Pinback fans for being their last project before signing with a record label. Many fans appreciate the intimate feel of the band making music as friends and this album draws upon that sound.


Our highlighted track, “Talby” has a hypnotic quality with its somber guitar loops and ambient vocals.


3) Miranda Hardy – “The Price of Happiness” (2024)
Originally pursuing a career in advertising, Miranda Hardy began professional songwriting to take after her dad, Jack Hardy. She was inspired by being at shows with him as a child and decided it was time to take her turn with a pen and guitar.


The singer’s sophomore album is her take on the choices and challenges of life. Making decisions and prioritizing what is important. Hardy has said that on this album she is treating her music with more seriousness while still having fun.


The highlighted track this week, “Strawberry Moon” is sweet in both its bright vocal delivery and folksy instrumentation.


2) Childish Gambino – “Atavista” (2024)
Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, started his musical career in 2011 with his album “Camp”. He was known widely as a comedian who got his start as a writer for “30 Rock” before becoming an actor. Both of us on the music team were big fans of his work in the show “Community” as Troy Barnes.


His comedy background and musical inclination explain the silly nature of his earlier work. When Gambino shifted into a more serious tone while maintaining his whimsy, he really began to shine as a musician. A good example from this album is the track “Psilocybae”, a quirky chronicle of his first time trying magic mushrooms.


This week’s highlighted track, “Final Church” is hard-hitting and reminiscent of gospel styles with the backing vocals.


1) Khal!l – “HEART: Melodies of the Eternal Flame” (2024)
R&B artist Khal!l hails from Milwaukee, where he found his love of singing by participating in his church’s choir. This led to his passion for music inspiring him to learn how to play instruments and produce music.


Khal!l takes inspiration from artists like Blood Orange, Bon Iver, and Toro y Moi. These artists are known for different things like disting melodies, omnipresent vocals, and electronic production. Khal!l fuses all of these elements together to create this latest album.


The highlighted track, “The Red Camellia” is a fun track with some imitation radio breaks, making us here at KCSU partial to it.

Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, started his musical career in 2011 with his album “Camp”. He was known widely as a comedian who got his start as a writer for “30 Rock” before becoming an actor. Both of us on the music team were big fans of his work in the show “Community” as Troy Barnes.


His comedy background and musical inclination explain the silly nature of his earlier work. When Gambino shifted into a more serious tone while maintaining his whimsy, he really began to shine as a musician. A good example from this album is the track “Psilocybae”, a quirky chronicle of his first time trying magic mushrooms.


This week’s highlighted track, “Final Church” is hard-hitting and reminiscent of gospel styles with the backing vocals.
