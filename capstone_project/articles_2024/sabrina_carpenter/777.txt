	The recent influx of fans Sabrina Carpenter has received since “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” began permeating pop aren’t fully caught up on all of her lore just yet. In a recent TikTok post, The Simpsons voice actress Nancy Cartwright is helping catch them up to speed on the familial front. “The rumors are true,” the actress, who has voiced Bart Simpson since the Eighties, wrote on the video app. “Sabrina Carpenter is my niece!” 

	Cartwright shared the caption beneath a video responding to a comment from a fan asking about their connection. “Isn’t that amazing?” she responded. “Maybe you’ve known me for a little while doing this little 10-year-old boy voice for like 35 some years, and some of you guys for way less than that — and find out that I’m related to this superstar. She’s pretty amazing.” 
Replying to @sapphirem__ The rumors are true! Sabrina Carpenter is my niece! 🥰 #sabrinacarpenter #bartsimpson #celebrities @Sabrina Carpenter 

	The video has more than 60,000 likes and over 600 comments, mostly made up of fans having their mind blown by the revelation. But Carpenter has spoken publicly about the niche Hollywood connection dating as far back as 2021. “By relation, I am also a legend,” she joked to Capital FM that year. “I will say, my whole life that was the coolest thing in the world to me. I wasn’t even really allowed to watch the show until I was a little bit older. But the woman is a woman of many talents, not just Bart. She always blows me away.”

	Carpenter continued: “It was always really cool growing up when she would just pull out the Bart voice if we were at a restaurant. She didn’t do it all the time, but there was a couple of times when we couldn’t get a table and she was like, ‘Hey man, I’m Bart Simpson. What the hell is going on?'” 
why is @romankemp talking to @SabrinaAnnLynn about her aunt the most pure thing in the world?! 🥺🥺🥺 pic.twitter.com/LsJ7rtfonf

	The pop musician’s own celebrity is more forward-facing that her aunt’s, enough that it’s unlikely she’ll ever have to try too hard — or slip into a character — to secure a reservation. Next month, Carpenter will release her latest studio album Short n’ Sweet. “My mom has been like, ‘Do you feel crazy right now?’” Carpenter recently told Rolling Stone about being propelled into such an intense level of fame this year. “I just love that people get my sense of humor.”
