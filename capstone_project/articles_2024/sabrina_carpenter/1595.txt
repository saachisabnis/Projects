"Please, please please," we could NEVER be sick of Sabrina Carpenter's hit "Espresso." 
At this year's Time 100 Next Gala in New York City, Sabrina took over the stage to perform two of her biggest hits, "Espresso" and Please, Please, Please," and before singing the first of these beloved fan favorites, she proclaimed, "If you’re sick of it, I’m sorry. If not, sing along!"
Carpenter attended in the awards in a gorgeous custom Versace silver strapless gown, showing some leg with a side slit. She shared on social media, along with a few snapshots of the night, after attending the gala, "honored to be on this cover and thank you @versace for the beautiful custom dress." She was honored on the Time 100 Next list, which honors the world's most influential rising stars.
The pop star had an incredible year as she supported Taylor Swift on her "Eras Tour" and released her newest album Short n' Sweet, which includes "Espresso" and "Please, Please, Please." After releasing the record, she wrote in a message to fans on social media, "I feel extremely lucky that each time I write a new record I learn a little bit more about myself, and can create from that place. the making of short n’ sweet was one of the most special, honest, up and down, stupid and fun experiences of my life. I thought if something was funny enough to make me laugh then maybe it belonged in a song. Happy or sad!"
