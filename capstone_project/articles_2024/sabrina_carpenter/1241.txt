The 2024 Billboard Music Awards are about to hit your TV screens.
One of the biggest nights in music, the annual BBMAs honor the year’s biggest artists, albums, songs, producers and songwriters, newcomers and music legends across multiple genres, based on data that tracks artist’s performance on the Billboard Charts.
In 2023, Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen were the big winners with Swift taking home 10 awards including Top Artist, Top Female Artist and Top Billboard 200 Artist. Wallen, meanwhile, won Top Billboard 200 Album for his record One Thing at a Time and Top Hot 100 Song for “Last Night.”
Tate McRae, meanwhile, gave an unforgettable performance of “Greedy,” her highest-charting Billboard Hot 100 hit.
Who will take home the top prizes this year and perform? Scroll down for everything we know so far about the 2024 BBMAs:
The BBMAs air on Thursday, December 12, at 8:00 p.m. ET on FOX and Fire TV. Viewers can also tune in on-demand on Paramount+. Performances will roll out across Billboard.com and on Billboard’s social media channels throughout the night.
