Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2024, a marathon, 5-1/2 hour production which eased ABC TV viewers into the new year, saw ratings increases in all four time quadrants measured, from the start of prime-time until late-late hours.

	The show, which Dick Clark originated in 1972, has ballooned over the years in hours of programming, just as the title of the show has expanded. Clark’s name remains in the title nearly a dozen years after his death, a unique and rare show of respect from a network for a long-time network star.

	










Ryan Seacrest, 49, is six years older than Clark was when the show launched. Seacrest shared hosting duties this year with Rita Ora and Jeannie Mai.
