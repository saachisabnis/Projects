Sabrina Carpenter’s career is on fire, and she’s now blazing her way to the top of the charts! The 25-year-old pop sensation has just scored her very first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with her catchy new single “Please Please Please” from her upcoming album Short n’ Sweet.
Last week, “Please Please Please” made a spectacular debut at #2 on the chart. Adding to the excitement, Sabrina also snagged the #3 spot with another track, “Espresso.” This week, she’s taken it up a notch, claiming the coveted #1 spot with “Please Please Please” and holding onto the #4 spot with “Espresso.”
Overwhelmed with gratitude and joy, Sabrina took to Instagram to share her excitement with fans. She wrote, “MY FIRST #1 on the @billboard HOT 100!!!!!!! And espresso at #4.. I’m very immensely grateful so i will surely always remember this day for the rest of my life! @jackantonoff @amyallen i deeply love this song and i love you both!!!!! I love our pitchy claps!!!!! I love @sharp_stick !!!! good things come in three’s 🥲. thank you everyone who’s listened and made it so much fun to have these songs out in the world. more to come soon 💋💋.”
Sabrina’s heartfelt post didn’t just celebrate her success—it also delivered a sharp comeback to a Twitter troll. The critic had dismissed “Please Please Please” with the comment, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone fumble a second single this hard. my goodness.” Sabrina clapped back by sharing a screenshot of the tweet, letting the chart-topping success of her song speak for itself.
In addition to her chart triumphs, Sabrina is gearing up to hit the road with her upcoming tour. Due to overwhelming demand, she’s adding extra shows in major cities. Fans in New York City and Los Angeles will be thrilled to hear that she’s performing second shows in both locations. Pre-sale tickets are available now, so fans should act fast to snag their spot at what promises to be an unforgettable concert experience.
The excitement surrounding her upcoming album Short n’ Sweet is palpable. With her recent chart successes, anticipation for the album is at an all-time high. Fans are eager to hear more of Sabrina’s new music and to see her perform live. Her dynamic presence and infectious energy are sure to make her tour one of the highlights of the year.
