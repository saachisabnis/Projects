Here’s our top takeaways from Day 1 of Weekend 2 at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival.
Do Lab vibes
With its own unique vibe, the Do Lab stage is basically its own mini-festival within Coachella. People who hang out all day at the Do Lab stage really love their electronic dance music and on Friday, April 20, of weekend two that love pulsated like a deep bass beat.
Friday’s lineup included house star HoneyLuv, experimental producers CocoRosie and South African DJ Jon Casey EDM. Fans were all smiles as they danced the day away to the pulsating beats.
This year adding to the vibes were several tall structures covered in loose fabric that danced in the wind as colored lights flashed underneath them. It seemed as if giant dancing flowers had joined the EDM-loving crowd.

Release the beers
Coachella has always been pretty strict when it comes to where people can drink alcohol on the festival grounds. In the past, people could only have drinks inside the designated beer gardens. Well, look out Las Vegas, because this year people could walk around anywhere they wanted with their drinks.
So not only could music fans grab a cold one and cheer on their favorite musicians, but the new rules also affected the various beer gardens. With fewer crowds and shorter and faster lines, it seemed like people didn’t feel like they needed to stay there and binge before going out to see the artists perform.

On stage
Sabrina Carpenter managed to surprise the Coachella main stage crowd when she introduced Norah Jones. Jones sang “Don’t Know Why” with Carpenter while playing a blue piano that matched the blue motel and car that were also on stage.
Carpenter continued to keep the crowd engaged between songs while performing fan favorites such as “because I liked a boy” and “nonsense” before playing her new single “Espresso.”
Chlöe Bailey was among the featured acts to perform on the Gobi stage, opening her set with the song “Have Mercy.”
She encouraged fans to sing along with her as she performed new singles “Boy Bye” and “FYS.”
Chlöe will have a new album coming out called “Trouble in Paradise” but was unable to give a release date.

Lil Uzi Vert brought fantastic energy to the Coachella Stage as he managed to perform virtually all of his hits in one set. The set was visually fun and full of life.
The rapper brings a Michael Jackson-esque energy to the stage with theatrical dance moves — definitely a fun time for fans and those who happened upon the performance alike.

Faye Webster brought her best game to Weekend 2 of the festival, where she performed a good mix of her classic songs like “Right Side of My Neck” and “A Dream With a Baseball Player,” as well as some off her album “Underdressed at the Symphony,” which released on March 1.
She effortlessly mixes an Indie sound with a bit of a twang, and it sounded awesome live. Plus, she opened with a Minions visual, which was weird, but the crowd was into it.
