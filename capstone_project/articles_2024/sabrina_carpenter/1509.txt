Things got a little "strange" at one of Sabrina Carpenter's recent tour stops when Millie Bobby Brown joined the crowd and was hilariously placed under "arrest" by the "Taste" singer.
Brown attended the Atlanta stop on Carpenter's Short n' Sweet Tour on Tuesday (October 22) with her Stranger Things co-star and close friend Noah Schnapp when the 25-year-old musician noticed the star and decided to place her under arrest for being "too hot," per E! News.
"I'm really distracted right now because I see this gorgeous girl," Carpenter said, bringing the cheering crowd's attention to Brown. She added, "I've never fallen in love at a concert before, but stranger things have happened." 
As Carpenter said she was just "too beautiful" and the jumbotron declared, "You're under arrest for being too hot," the 20-year-old Enola Holmes star played along, holding up her wrists and shouting, "Please!" Videos of the moment were also shared across social media.
The "Espresso" singer then switched costumes during the choreographed exchange, ditching her long yellow skirt for another shorter outfit as she joked, "Now I just feel like my clothes are embarrassed. What have you done to me? Oh my god, not my skirt falling off in front of so many people."
The cheeky exchange ended with Carpenter dedicated her song "Juno" to Brown and gifting her with a pair of fuzzy pink handcuffs as Schnapp watched in awe in the background.
Another special guest was in attendance at the show, Carpenter's rumored boyfriend Barry Keoghan. He was seen supporting his girlfriend from the crowd, wearing what appeared to be a shirt with her face on it. At another recent Short n' Sweet show, the Irish actor had the best reaction to one of her flirty lyrics.
