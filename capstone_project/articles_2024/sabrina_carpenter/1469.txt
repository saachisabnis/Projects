Strictly Come Dancing enthusiasts are buzzing with excitement, suggesting Tasha Ghouri has what it takes to clinch this year's BBC competition after a significant hint was dropped.
The ballroom bonanza that is Strictly Come Dancing returned with a flourish for its 2024 series following an electrifying launch show. Viewers saw the return of legendary hosting duo Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, guiding audiences as 15 new pairings twirl their bid for victory and the coveted Glitterball trophy.
In the opening week, the celebrities and their professional dance partners got their first opportunity to impress and score leaderboard points with their inaugural dances.
This year sees Tasha Ghouri paired up with the professional whirlwind Aljaz Skorjanec, who made his comeback to the Strictly stage. Tasked with a Cha Cha routine to the rhythm of Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso", their performance captivated head judge Shirley Ballas, reports the Mirror.
After bestowing her critique on Tasha, Shirley remarked: "You're on your way to have one of the most spectacular leg actions I think I have ever seen on the show."
A visibly impressed Claudia labelled Shirley's feedback as "extraordinary", while home viewers promptly began forecasting that Tasha would be raising the glitterball in triumph.
Social media platforms were abuzz with compliments; one viewer took to X, writing: "I loved Tasha. What a dance! ! ! ! #Strictly." Another enthusiast tweeted: "Tasha is SENSATIONAL #Strictly" followed by another fan who echoed: "Tasha Ghouri was absolutely incredible on strictly, she is sooooo good #Strictly."
One more supporter predicted a bright future for the pairing: "ALJAZ is back Him and Tasha for the final #Strictly."
Although the judges will provide feedback and the celebrities will receive scores, no one will be sent home in the first week. The real tension begins in week two when one celebrity will be eliminated permanently.
Audiences can get involved when the lines open next Saturday (September 28) for week two, with the first elimination of the series airing the following night (Sunday, September 29). Tonight's action will commence at 7pm on BBC One, but there won't be a results show this weekend.
Currently leading the betting odds are X Factor winner Shayne Ward and JLS star JB Gill however, former professional dancer Erin Boag has highlighted Miranda star Sarah Hadland as another contender to keep an eye on.
