Travis Scott added yet another career triumph to his long list this week when “Goosebumps” became his second song to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
On Wednesday (August 28), the Kendrick Lamar collaboration from 2016’s Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight vaulted over the 10 million mark in sales — the standard for Diamond — and jumped from its previous certification of 8 million back in 2021 all the way to 13 million.

“Goosebumps” is now Scott’s second Diamond track, following “Sicko Mode,” which reached the 10 million mark in 2020 (and likewise on Wednesday received additional certifications, pushing it up to 14 times platinum).
As for Kendrick, it’s his first-ever Diamond plaque.

Going Diamond again wasn’t Scott’s only good sales news of the week. His recently re-released 2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo is on course to outsell most other Hip Hop albums from 2024.
Released commercially for the first time last week to celebrate the project’s 10th anniversary, Days Before Rodeo is estimated to sell 217,000 equivalent units in its first week, according to HITS Daily Double.

The mixtape is competing for the number one spot on the Billboard 200 and in most other weeks would easily top the chart. However, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short N’ Sweet is currently tracking at over 300,000 equivalent sales and is expected to beat Travis.
HITS Daily Double reports that the Houston rapper still has an outside chance of topping Carpenter, though, as he is known for putting up big physical and digital sales numbers.

While Days Before Rodeo was released on streaming services, a deluxe edition featuring five bonus songs is exclusively available to purchase on the rapper’s website, along with vinyl copies.
If the estimates are correct, Days Before Rodeo would have the third biggest first-week sales of any rap album this year, behind only Eminem’s The Death of Slim Shady (281,000) and Future and Metro Boomin’s We Don’t Trust You (251,000).

The 10-year-old mixtape would outsell major releases like Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 1 and Vultures 2, J. Cole’s Might Delete Later, 21 Savage’s American Dream and Gunna’s One of Wun.
Travis Scott has even teased putting together a tour dedicated to Days Before Rodeo.
