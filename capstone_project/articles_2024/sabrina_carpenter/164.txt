Sabrina Carpenter is opening up about what she looks for in a partner, describing her approach to dating as "messy" and "fun."
The "Espresso" singer shared more about her romantic life in a new interview with Cosmopolitan UK that came out Tuesday (May 21), giving some insight into her dating life and the qualities she is "super attracted" to, per People. 
"I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends," she said. "So a lot of it is energy and humor and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions."
When it comes to finding a partner, Carpenter said that a lot of the time it "has been fate" as she doesn't necessarily go looking for love, telling the outlet, "I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love."
Carpenter, who has been romantically linked to Irish actor Barry Keoghan since late 2023, also hit back at claims that she has a specific type when it comes to the appearance of a partner.
"Contrary to popular opinion, I don't think I have a type," she said. "But the internet loves to just put pictures next to each other of men who have the same hair color."
Since sparking dating rumors, the pair have been seen spending more time together, even seemingly made their red carpet debut at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in March. Earlier this month, they were seen sharing a kiss in a behind-the-scenes video of Carpenter preparing for the Met Gala.
