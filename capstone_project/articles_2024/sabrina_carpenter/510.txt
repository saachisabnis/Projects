Ah yes, “Good Luck, Babe!” — exactly what we’d tell anyone attempting to hit all of the same high notes as Chappell Roan. Me espresso brewer Sabrina Carpenter put her own spin on her labelmate’s track when she covered it for BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge, showing off her lower register and adding in a bit of country twang. Carpenter recently told Rolling Stone that she listens to fellow rising pop princess Roan “all the time” and specifically has “Good Luck, Babe!” on “loopty loop,” so it sounds like she’s had plenty of opportunities to think about how to add a shot of her personality into the song.
