Ashley Avignone has been in Taylor Swift‚Äôs inner circle since long before the duo attended Kansas City Chiefs games together.
Avignone was in Swift‚Äôs star-studded suite in October 2023 when the Chiefs played the New York Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey. She was by Swift‚Äôs side in December 2023 at the Chiefs game against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium.
The following month, Avignone joined Swift again to see the Chiefs take on the Buffalo Bills in the playoffs at Highmark Stadium. She clearly earned her spot in Swift‚Äôs star-studded suite at Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024 to watch the Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers.
In addition to football games, Swift and Avignone have also enjoyed nights out going to dinner. In December 2024, Swift celebrated Avignone‚Äôs birthday in New York City.
‚ÄúHappy birthday to me, emphasis on the *happy* üòÜ,‚Äù the stylist captioned a pic of her and Swift sharing a sweet embrace in a restaurant booth. In February 2025, Avignone joined Swift at Super Bowl LIX to watch the Chiefs play against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans.
Keep scrolling to get to know Avignone:
Avignone was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Arizona. When it was time to go to college, she moved back to LA to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM) to study fashion design. She moved to New York City in 2013.
After finishing her studies, Avignone began her career as a stylist. She got her start as an assistant celebrity stylist and appeared on season 3 of The Rachel Zoe Project in 2010. Two years later, Avignone went out on her own and signed with the agency, The Wall Group.
‚ÄúI assisted the best stylists in the game for about 6 years, and when I decided to break out on my own I was nervous,‚Äù she said of her accomplishment in an October 2013 interview with Simply. ‚ÄúI was extremely lucky in finding representation right away. You have to believe in yourself, but it also helps when others believe in you too.‚Äù
She later moved away from red carpet styling, focusing on styling directly with major fashion brands on various campaigns as well as interior design.
Avignone also runs her own company, aptly titled Avignone Studio.
Avignone and Swift connected through mutual friend Emma Stone, who also grew up in Arizona. In addition to being childhood friends, Avignone previously styled Stone for events. While Swift and Avignone met through Stone, the duo‚Äôs friendship has flourished over the years. In December 2019, Avignone posted a touching tribute in honor of Swift‚Äôs birthday.
‚Äú30 years of life for you, 11 years of friendship for us. Thanks for being the bestest friend, listener, dance party-starter, story teller, haircut enthusiast, with the biggest, warmest, and most generous heart,‚Äù she wrote via Instagram at the time. ‚ÄúHappy Birthday Tay!! Love you to pieces ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù
