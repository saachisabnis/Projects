You are such an annoying user on this site. You hate everything, you are incredibly rude. Why has no moderator ever banned you?
Let Gucci be lol.

Gucci is like that neighborhood dog that takes a dump on your lawn every morning.  There is always a new pile so you just learn to ignore it and move on with your day.

@ProfessorChaos
I feel like there’s opportunity for Summit in the song categories, but I’m not sure at whose expense.
Dance Electronic Recording
I think the locks are
• Disclosure – “She’s Gone, Dance On”
• Fred again.. & Baby Keem – “leavemealone”
• Justice & Tame Impala – “Neverender”
Likely but not a lock
• Jamie xx & Honey Dijon – “Baddy on the Floor”
Last spot, I have:
• Kaytranada & Childish Gambino – “Witchy”
The Kaytranada tune isn’t exactly a big hit. I think Dom Dolla, Caribou, Diplo & Hugel or John Summit & Sub Focus could take that slot. My gut tells me go with Dom Dolla’s “girl$”, but I’ll be lazy and go with the name recognition choice.
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”

BEST DANCE/ELECTRONIC ALBUM
Charli XCX, Brat (BARF!)
Justice, Hyperdrama (BARF!)
Kaytranada, Timeless (BARF!)
John Summit, Comfort in Chaos (BARF!)
Zedd, Telos (BARF!)
These will be the final five. I think Nia Archives is just too obscure to make the Final Cut. Charli, Justice, Kaytranada, Zedd & John Summit are all playing to 20k+ people in L.A. & NY where most votes will be coming from. Nia is playing a 1000 seat club in Hollywood. Visibility is everything, unfortunately.

I was wondering too. I assumed this one: https://www.amazon.com/Afterimage-Justice-Remix-Amazon-Original/dp/B0D3FHXG2G
Fuck it, let’s cause some Chaos.
Best Dance Pop Recording:
• Madison Beer – “Make You Mine”
• Charli XCX – “Von Dutch”
• Ariana Grande – “yes, and?”
• Kylie Minogue, Tove Lo & Bebe Rexha – “My Oh My”
• John Summit & Hayla – “Shiver”
I’ll save  @Gucci the trouble and respond for him
”Honey, Get real, not happening, pure delusion, BARF! FART! *gives birth*”

How do you feel about “Life” getting in this category,  @ProfessorChaos? I think it has a shot but I don’t see anyone predicting it.
It’ll definitely get votes. I just think the Jamie xx and Robyn combination will get lost in the mix behind Billie, Calvin & Guetta. There’s so many interchangeable possibilities in that category, it’s kinda exciting. By so many assumed favorites not competing, I think there’s room for some risky predictions! This was a fun category to do some cross-tab analyzing. 
We know Charli & Ari are locks. Madison Beer seems to be peaking at the right time. Then we look at where the Dance votes might go (I think Summit/Hayla have the track that DJs actually play every weekend) and the previous winner/previous nominee combo of Kylie/Bebe squeezes by, in the slot that probably would’ve gone to Guetta.
