It's giving noughties Bratz doll realness 
We love a good Y2K look here at Cosmo, whether it's Sabrina Carpenter in a mini bubble skirt, Rihanna's #Back2Skool hairstyle, or Addison Rae literally channelling Lizzie McGuire in a nostalgic Trevi Fountain photoshoot. Seriously, it gives us life. 
And, the latest celebrity to lean into the iconic noughties aesthetic is none other than Jennifer Lopez. The 54-year-old just took to the gram to share three pics of her wearing an all-white outfit that looks like something we deffo would have dressed our Bratz dolls up in back in the day. 
Consisting of a pair of white denim jeans and a plunging white fitted halter top, JLo took things up a Y2K notch by adding a chunky brown suede belt and an oversized tan leather bag. Oh, the nostalgia! 
Not forgetting the accessories, the singer paired the casual look with a pair of chunky gold Chanel hooped earrings and a statement gold bangle. Then, JLo styled her honey blonde locks in a slicked back low bun with a middle parting to tie the aesthetic together. Makeup-wise, she opted for a subtle winged eyeliner, a touch of blush, and a nude-pink shiny lipgloss. 
After posting the carousel to her grid - which reached her 252 million followers - plenty of the actor's fans took to the comments section to rave over the look. This included fellow Y2K lover Sabrina Carpenter, who simply typed: "beautiful!!!!" Not to mention the queen of noughties fashion herself, Paris Hilton, who dropped a heart-eye emoji. 
Officially *obsessed* with this vibe.
