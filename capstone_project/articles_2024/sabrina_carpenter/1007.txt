Releasing her sixth studio album, Short n’ Sweet back in August, Sabrina Carpenter decided to celebrate her newest record with a tour. Just a month after releasing her album, she hit the road for her Short n’ Sweet Tour. The tour kicked off in Columbus, Ohio on September 23rd and will run until March 2025 with one last show in Milan, Italy. While not having a great deal of time away from the stage, the hitmaker recently surprised fans at a Taylor Swift concert when she appeared on stage for a special duet of her hit song “Espresso.” 
Getting a chance to see Swift in concert is more than enough for countless Swifties, but to see her share the stage with Carpenter had the entire arena on its feet. Although Swift usually spends her concert diving into her own discography, on Saturday night, she decided to honor Carpenter by covering “Espresso.” Not wanting to sing the song alone, she asked the crowd if she could call her friend. After sharing a short conversation, Carpenter appeared on stage.

Together, Swift and Carpenter not only performed “Espresso” but they also covered hits like “Is It Over Now?” and “Please Please Please.” Expressing her gratitude, Swift explained, “She has literally one day off. She is on tour. This is crazy that she came to perform for us.”

While Carpenter appeared to love her moment with Swift, the singer recently opened up about her stardom growing. Back in May, the singer took over Saturday Night Live with Jake Gyllenhaal. Still shocked over the invite, she said, “There were so many things I dreamt of doing as a little girl I got to do this year that felt like such a cool, sweet, little bucket-list moment for my younger self. I literally threw up when I found out about SNL. Not to be graphic.” 
With Carpenter performing on SNL and sharing the stage with Swift, she thought her time in the spotlight would be different. “I grew up watching those performances and being like, I want to do that. But then it all just seemed so – not even out of reach, just like I had a different plan in my head of when it was all supposed to happen.”
Enjoying her career in the music industry, Carpenter looked to the future as she hoped to perform at the Grammys next.
