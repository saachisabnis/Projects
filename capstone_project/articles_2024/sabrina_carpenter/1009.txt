Imagine the song from Madagascar being your top track
It’s a bit later than usual, but Spotify Wrapped is finally here and everyone is loving looking back at their listening stats from the past year.
As always, the feature tells you all kinds of info including your top artists, songs, and how many minutes you spent listening to them.
For many, Spotify Wrapped Day is super embarrassing as they find out what rubbish they’ve really been listening to for the entire year.
Perhaps you spent 100 whole days listening to Taylor Swift, or all fives top songs were from that same Nicki Minaj album.
Well, if you thought your Spotify Wrapped was embarrassing, wait until you see these.
