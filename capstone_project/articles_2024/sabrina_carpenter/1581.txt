Federal investigators are looking into two more prominent figures with ties to New York City Mayor Eric Adams -- a close advisor and a monsignor with the Brooklyn Diocese, NBC News New York reported.
A Catholic church in Brooklyn received a subpoena requesting information about financial or business dealing between Frank Carone, the former chief of staff to Adams, and Monsignor Jamie Gigantiello, the station reported. 
Several sources familiar with the matter told the news station that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are looking into any possible business dealings involving Carone and the monsignor. Neither man has been charged with any wrongdoing and it appears the federal inquiry is in its early stages.
A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Diocese did not deny that a subpoena was issued to the monsignor's church and issued this statement: “The Diocese is fully committed to cooperating with law enforcement in all investigations, including of conduct at individual parishes or involving any priests.“
The monsignor posted photos on social media with Carone and Adams from a trip to Rome in May, the station reported. 
He was demoted in 2023 after pop star Sabrina Carpenter filmed a controversial music video inside his Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Williamsburg. He said he regretted the decision and had been unaware of the video's contents.
