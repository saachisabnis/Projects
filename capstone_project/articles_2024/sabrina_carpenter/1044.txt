Rock legends Manic Street Preachers will be heading to the South West as band return to perform in Bristol. The chart-topping band, who formed in Wales in 1986, have just announced that their 15th studio album will be released in the new year.
The rockers have previously played shows in Bristol in 2013 and 2017, as well as their last appearance in the city when they headlined at Ashton Gate Stadium in May 2022.
And now, the band are set to return to Bristol in 2025, performing at Bristol Beacon for one night only on April 26, 2025.
The tour coincides with the news of their new album, which the band announced on X (formerly Twitter), on October 25, writing: "The new album 'Critical Thinking', out 31st Jan 2025."
The post went on to also announce the album tour, stating: "Pre-order a copy from the official UK store before Tues 29th Oct 3pm for pre-sale access to the Spring 2025 UK tour. Pre-sale starts Weds 30th at 9.30am. General sale starts Fri 1st 9:30am. "
 The first single from the new album, 'Decline & Fall', was released back in August, spending four weeks in the Top 100 on the Official UK Singles Charts. And the band's brand new single, 'Hiding In Plain Sight', is available to listen to as of today, October 25, with lead vocals from the band's lyricist and bassist, Nicky Wire.
The new album will be available from January 31, 2025, on CD, LP, hardbook CD, and even cassette, with two exclusive songs available on a limited-edition 7" record. For all versions available, visit the band's website. 
Meanwhile, fans who are keen to go to the tour when it hits Bristol can pre-order the album between now and next Tuesday (October 29), to secure pre-sale access to tickets. The pre-sale will begin on Wednesday, October 30, at 9.30am. General sale will be available from next Friday, November 1, also at 9.30am.
Elsewhere in music, fans who missed out in the Coldplay ticket sale last month can still bag tickets to any one of the band's 12 shows in London and Hull next August and September.
