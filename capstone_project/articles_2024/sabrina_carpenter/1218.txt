...and, of course, lacy stockings
Girlies, it's no secret we're all out here trying to steal Sabrina Carpenter's style. 
The 25-year-old music sensation has crafted a personal style that's, well, short n' sweet: mini dresses, lace negligees, girly bows and feathers. At this point she's basically the human embodiment of "sugar and spice and all things nice".
Need a recap? We've gotcha. She's strutted the runway in a retro red and white striped swimsuit, rocked a vintage Old Hollywood gown once worn by Madonna, posed in an iconic denim hot pants bikini, and graced us with a tiny white corset worn with frilly underwear. Yep, some truly iconic scenes!
And now, with the Short n' Sweet tour underway, there will be plenty more gorge Sabrina fits to look out for. Opening her tour in Columbus, Ohio, Sabrina stepped out on stage in a seriously gag-worthy outfit. 
Specifically, she opened up a bejewelled blanket to put a vvvvv special basque on display. (Side note: don't you just love a dramatic outfit reveal?)
The long corset/playsuit extended past her hips and featured a lace trim, a sweetheart neckline, in-built bra cups and a camp lipstick kiss embellishment and was accessorised with lacy stockings. The best bit, however, was that Sabrina was simply covered in crystals: 150,000+ hand-placed crystals, to be exact. 
Sadly, we won't be able to buy this exact look since it's custom Victoria's Secret (please, please, please can Sabrina release a VS line?) so you may well catch us trying to glue diamantÃ© onto our lingerie...
