	It’s Sabrina Carpenter for the win on Australia’s charts as Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds enjoy the top album debut.

	Carpenter’s sixth studio album and first leader, Short n’ Sweet (via Island/Universal), extends its stay at the ARIA Chart summit for a second week, in doing so denying Nick Cave a homegrown leader with Wild God, new at No. 2. 

	It’s the alternative lock legends’ 14th ARIA top 10 album, and the followup to Ghosteen, which peaked at No. 2 in 2019. Cave’s 2021 collaboration with Dirty Three leader Warren Ellis, Carnage, also reached No. 2.
