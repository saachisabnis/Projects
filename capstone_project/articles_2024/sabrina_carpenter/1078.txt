If anyone can pull off wearing a hazmat suit to Coachella, it’s Doja Cat. The star stunned everyone by changing six different times during her Coachella headlining show—and somehow, each of Doja Cat’s Coachella outfits was better than the last. The star’s set was full of songs from her 2023 album Scarlet, and she made sure to capture the music’s darker vibes with her elaborate production choices and outfits. While Doja Cat’s been known to pull some weird looks, hers are by far the strangest outfits we’ve seen grace the Coachella stage this year.
Doja Cat’s previous outfits gave us high expectations for her Coachella set. Let’s not forget she once dressed up as a cat for the Met Gala and showed up to fashion week covered head-to-toe in red Swarvoski crystals. Although Coachella performers like Sabrina Carpenter and Lana Del Rey switched up their looks mid-set, Doja Cat’s commitment to serving six different looks is unmatched. The star started in hazmat suit, stripped down to a furry bikini—and ended up in a leotard covered in hair. While her performance was over-the-top, her clothes were even wilder, giving us enough weird fashion inspo to last the rest of the year. 
While Coachella fashion has long been associated with flower crowns and boho silhouettes, Doja Cat is paving the way for all of the weird fashion lovers out there. And her experimental fashion choices have us hoping that future headliners will wear looks just as out-of-this-world as hers. Sure, we probably won’t see hazmat suits become a big festival trend anytime soon. But furry bikinis, hair leotards, and galactic costumes? It’s all to play for.
Who knew a hazmat suit could look so chic? While Brockhampton once wore silver coveralls for their Coachella set, something about Doja Cat’s yellow rubber gloves has us wanting to live out our Breaking Bad fantasy.
Doja Cat loves a hair moment, and the unveiling of her long blonde hair gave us a sneak peek of the hair-raising look that was soon to come. 
We love a hairy fashion moment, and these blonde hair boots and bodysuit make the perfect head-turning Coachella look. Accompanied by a few Sasquatch-looking back up dancers, the Coachella stage has never seen a ‘fit this weird work so well.
Of course Doja Cat couldn’t settle on just one hair moment. This time sporting her blonde buzzcut, the star wore a belted bodysuit with white tights and gold boots to match. 
Doja Cat looks like she just stepped out of a sci-fi movie in this clear set. The star wore a corset top with shorts and thigh-high boots for a truly out-of-this-world look. 
To complement her head-to-toe blonde look, Doja Cat wore a furry two-piece bikini and oversized sunglasses. The look is a perfect twist on the usual Coachella bikini with all of the weirdness that Doja loves.
