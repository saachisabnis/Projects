Sabrina Carpenter celebrated her birthday in style! The “Espresso” singer rocked a mini version of the iconic yellow dress from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days at her birthday party over the weekend. Andie Anderson herself (a.k.a. Kate Hudson) even approved of the nostalgic nod! “That’s that Andie Anderson Espresso 💛💛💛💛😘,” Hudson commented on the post.
