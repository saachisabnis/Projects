	The season finale of Saturday Night Live arrives this weekend, and the occasion brought together Jake Gyllenhaal, cast member Bowen Yang, and musical guest Sabrina Carpenter for the traditional Thursday promo. 

	As usual, it was an exercise in hilarity.

	In the first segment, the lads claim to have a Carpenter song stuck in their heads. Only it’s not her song.   

	Then Yang mentions that Gyllenhaal’s body in Roadhouse was the inspiration for his own fitness journey, before scoffing at the notion.   

	Finally, the big finish: Where does the name “Carpenter” come from? Watch the clip for the surprising answer.
