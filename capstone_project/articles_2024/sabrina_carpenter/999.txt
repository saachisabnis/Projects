In terms of yearly music recaps, Spotify Wrapped is the It Girl. 
Often imitated, but never duplicated, Spotify has something special. Throughout the calendar year, they are collecting user’s listening data to give you an overview of your top songs, artists, and podcasts. 
While most music streaming platforms have created their own version, Spotify Wrapped remains superior. With personalized artist videos from your top artists (and now podcasters, too!), multiple playlists dedicated to your top songs of 2024, and more, Wrapped is much more than meets the eye. 
But…we all know the best part about Wrapped: bragging to your friends.
This was my year of Lana Del Rey, so I bragged to my friends that I was in the top 1% of listeners out of all Spotify users. 
On the other hand, since my top songs included “BIRDS OF A FEATHER” by Billie Eilish and “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter, I have been deemed “basic” and “predictable” by my friends. 
It’s cut-throat during Spotify Wrapped season…but one thing I always wonder is what the artists themselves are doing on the big day. 
Sure, they’re obsessing over their own numbers…but I know a good share of them are equally as excited to see who their own top artists are. 
I would pay good money to see Harry Styles’ Spotify Wrapped results, if only he’d be so kind to share…
But this year was exciting because many artists like Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, and more revealed their results. 
Artists…they’re just like us: streaming BRAT all summer long.
