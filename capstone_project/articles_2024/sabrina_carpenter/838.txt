Boise has lots of great music artists coming and going. We love when big artists come to Boise and perform for everyone. There have been a lot of great artists that have announced shows that are coming here as well. We have upcoming shows from The Driver Era and The Wrecks in 2025 that we could not be more excited about. But what happens when an artist stops coming to Boise?
Boise was heartbroken that Sabrina Carpenter would not be coming back this year after performing in Boise for her last tour but she's not the only artist to make this decision.

Country artist Kelsea Ballerini was here not too long ago on tour and played an amazing summer show at the Idaho Botanical Gardens. Everyone was over the moon that she was coming to Boise and people were lining up to be front row at the concert hours before it even started. There was a lot of excitement about her coming to Boise and the concert was amazing however there was one little hick up during the show.
People were so excited to see Kelsea Ballerini that they seemed to forget decent concert etiquette including that is not a good idea to throw things on stage. While it would definitely be fun to trade bracelets with Kelsea Ballerini it is also important to remember she is a person too and it's not okay to throw things at her.
Sadly, this morning Kelsea announced her newest tour and Boise was not included in the stops. After the incident it doesn't seem like she is coming back so going forward we have to remember to make sure musical artists are welcome here so that they can continue touring in Boise.
