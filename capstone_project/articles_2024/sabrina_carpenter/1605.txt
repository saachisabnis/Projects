As this year comes to an end, apparently there were lots of words that we all mispronounced... Here are the ones that were mispronounced the most!
Barry Keoghan - Award-winning Irish actor Barry Keoghan kind of became a household name in 2024 for his relationship with Sabrina Carpenter and his role in Gladiators II. 
Shein - Fast fashion seems to be everywhere these days and Chinese-founded fast-fashion giant Shein, pronounced [SHE-in] and not [SHEEN], has often puzzled shoppers with its name.
Semaglutide - One of the active ingredients in injectable weightloss drug Ozempic, Semaglutide, has caused a buzz this year. The weight loss ingredient has been a hot topic â€“ but are we saying it correctly?
Chappell Roan - She really made waves in 2024 for her music and her Christmas collab with Sabrina Carpenter.
