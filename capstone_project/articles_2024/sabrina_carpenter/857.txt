With this latest summer concert announcement, the Maine Savings Amphitheater is getting ready to say, ‘Let’s go, girls!’
We absolutely love the summer concert season here in Maine, especially in Bangor. It gives us something exciting to look forward to during the colder months when we’re missing that classic ‘summer concert’ weather. The anticipation of which big names will be announced next adds to the excitement, and it’s something we look forward to every year.
On Monday, December 16th, Shania Twain announced a new show at the Maine Savings Amphitheater on the Bangor Waterfront. The event, titled ‘Shania Twain: Live in Concert,’ is set for Tuesday, July 22nd, 2025.
Shania Twain has a stack of awards, countless hits, and over 100 million albums sold worldwide. From ‘Man! I Feel Like a Woman!’ to ‘You’re Still the One,’ her songs and music videos are unforgettable classics that shaped a generation.
Artists like Post Malone, who performed in Bangor in 2024, Rihanna (who we’d love to see in Maine someday), and Harry Styles have cited her as a major influence. Styles, in particular, surprised fans by bringing Shania out during his Coachella 2022 set. Most recently, Shania joined Sabrina Carpenter on Netflix’s ‘A Nonsense Christmas’ special, where they performed a duet of ‘Santa Baby.’
Don’t miss your chance to grab tickets early! The presale runs Thursday, December 19th, from 10 AM to 10 PM using the code VOCALS, and tickets go on sale to the general public on Friday, December 20th, at 10 AM.
