It’s a chilly morning. Here’s a thing to warm up the tenors.


By Bryan MacKenzie

It’s rivalry week, so this is the perfect time to discuss this year’s most entertaining rivalry: Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar.
For those of you who are unaware, Kendrick Lamar and Drake are a rapper and a Canadian bandwagon sports enthusiast, respectively. They are two of the most popular and well-known (and well-paid) musical performers of the last decade. Drake has sold more than 170 million records. Kendrick has won 17 Grammys and a literal actual Pulitzer Prize. I don’t know why I’m explaining this. You know who they are.
Well, the two got themselves involved in a running rap battle this spring. Things escalated and escalated, until Kendrick’s release of the diss track “Not Like Us” on May 4. At which point the rap battle ended. Because the moment the words “tryin’ to strike a chord, and it’s probably A-minor” were uttered, Drake collapsed like a bouncy castle when you disconnect the inflating motor thingy.


[After THE JUMP: Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence.]

But then things got worse for Drake. Because most rap battles, even between very high-profile rappers, stay pretty insular. But Not Like Us, being the catchy little ditty that it was, broke contain. Every human being on the planet had heard the song within about 20 minutes. By fall, Junior High bands were playing it in halftime shows. Banks were using the instrumental version as customer service ‘hold’ music. It replaced the national anthems of like seven different countries. It was retroactively added to the collection on the Voyager spacecraft.
On the one hand, social media is destroying America. On the other hand, social media allowed us to discuss this when it dropped. So it’s impossible to say whether social media is good or bad.
It should have ended there. But this week—six and a half months later—Drake responded. By filing two lawsuit-type substances; one in New York, and one in Texas. He claimed, among other things, that Kendrick’s record label (which is also DRAKE’S record label) engaged in illegal shenanigans to promote Not Like Us, and that Kendrick’s accusations on Not Like Us constituted defamation.
The response was, universally, laughter. Laughter so long and loud that my sides hurt. And then, after the laughter died down for a moment, more laughter as we remembered again. 
It wasn’t just those lawsuits were/are never going to be successful… though, to be clear, they were/are never going to be successful. We spent an entire semester in law school on rap feuds, and the short version is that saying “he called me names in round 7 of a rap battle” is the equivalent of arguing in a personal injury case “…and then the Waffle House employee threw the chair back at me.” Like, you handed a trained professional a convenient and deadly weapon, so what did you expect was going to happen?
No, people laughed primarily because that’s not how rap battles work. You can’t sue during a rap battle. That’s so far away from rap battle decorum that it isn’t even addressed in the handbook. Your opponent released a diss track on YouTube, and you handed your response to a 57-year-old court clerk named Peggy with a $200 filing fee.
I do appreciate Drake doing this, though. Because I now have a reference point to explain to my non-football-fan acquaintances my take on Ryan Day.
Day has a lot going for him. He has a 66-9 record as Ohio State’s head coach, and a 46-4 record in Big Ten play. His teams have won at least 11 games in every full season they’ve played. He has recruited as much talent as any team in the country. 
But Ryan Day is Football Drake. He’ll put together some head-nodders and sell as many albums as anyone, but you don’t hear people saying “Day was straight FIRE on that verse” anymore. No, he’s a good artist making good music that you can safely slot in between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter on the XM Radio pop station (largely on the back of other peoples’ talent). That’s how you end up with an 88% winning percentage, but with a 1-3 record against Michigan, a 2-4 bowl record, and a sub-par record against his handful of elite opponents. 
It explains the weird beard dye situation, at least
You can tell he wants to be more. He wants to be seen as a singular force, like an Urban Meyer or a Jim Harbaugh or a Nick Saban. That’s why he’s always picking fights with Lou Holtz or taking offense to someone who looks at numbers about Ohio State and says “hey, look at these numbers.” It’s why every loss has an excuse and why no error was his fault. And its why, when he finally started taking shots on the chin from his biggest rival, he reacted by tattling to the NCAA about Connor Stalions. 
That’s not rap battle behavior. And when people say “he doesn’t get the rivalry,” I think this is what they mean. He’s looking to move to 2-0 against Michigan, with three other games that we will all agree didn’t happen because Assorted Reasons. Urban Meyer, for allllllll of his flaws, took beating Michigan on as part of his whole soul. Even when he beat Michigan, he kept his program entirely focused on that task for the next year. Ryan Day seems content to beat the hell out of Michigan State on the theory that Michigan is just Better Michigan State and not an entirely different creature.
Fortunately for Day (at least in the short term), Michigan is not very good right now. Ohio State is a flat track bully, but Michigan is a pretty flat track right now. So we’ll have to wait for next season to figure out whether he really learned anything, or whether there are any additional appeals that need to be filed. Ohio State 34, Michigan 13

In a lot of ways, modern life is better than it’s ever been. Life has never been as convenient, abundant, and hyper optimized as it is today. 
Want to make it across town in the next 45 minutes? No need to take 2 different subway lines and a bus. A few taps on the phone and personalized driver will be at your doorstep in under 5 minutes. 
Want to watch a movie? No need to pore over the local newspaper’s entertainment section for movie reviews, blindly trust a friend’s “word of mouth” recommendation, and hope that there are still extra VHS copies tucked behind the cover display at the local Blockbuster. A few taps of your remote control and you’ll have a limitless queue of content perfectly curated based on your preferences and viewing habits on your TV screen before you can say “Siskel.” Even if you aren’t sure about what to watch, you can instantly squash every single movie review in existence into a soulless two-dimensional aggregated percentage score. Who needs friends for something as antiquated as “word-of-mouth” when you have Rotten Tomatoes?
Want a particular meal from your favorite restaurant? No need to call ahead and wrangle for a reservation or make a takeout order. There’s a delivery app for that. You can get what you want in under 30 minutes without having to walk further than your front door or uttering a single word to another human being.
Want an answer to a hard question about science, mathematics, history or anything in between? No need to drive to the local library, pull out an Encyclopedia, or flip to the back and use something as arcane as an “Index”. You just need to punch your query into ChatGPT and an omnipotent large language model that has ingested the trillions upon trillions of words ever uttered in human history will serve you a milquetoast, sanitized answer in 0.36 seconds.
In a lot of ways, modern life is a modern marvel. The world’s information and resources, ranging from arts to commerce, are at our fingertips. But, in a lot of ways, modern life has sapped the spontaneous delight and serendipity from our older, more laborious traditions. Seeing the wonders of downtown while walking to public transport instead of mindlessly jumping into an Uber listening to your AirPods. Eagerly listening to the whispered excitement of your childhood friend breathlessly explaining why you had to go see Reservoir Dogs as if it was a mischievous secret just between the two of you. Having to walk to your favorite restaurant without an OpenTable reservation and actually having to wait to be seated, opening the possibilities of a cheeky drink at the bar or actual human conversation. Falling headfirst into a book instead of asking an app to summarize it for you.
Yes, I know I sound like the old man shaking his fist and yelling at the clouds. Yes, I know these technological wonders have unlocked untold benefits and value. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t certain charms and benefits to an older, slower way of living that exposed us to a larger surface area for wonder and surprise. And maybe that’s what I love about college football.
If our day-to-day life, which has been carefully curated, nudged, and outright steered by the clandestinely all-knowing algorithms around us, then college football is the exact opposite. Even amidst the current sea change in college sports that will inevitably culminate in the full professionalization of amateurism—big money NIL collectives, transfer portals, and conference realignment—at its core, college football has remained true to itself for decades. A bunch of 18- to 22-year-old kids playing a chaotic game, making an equal amount of amazing plays and gasp-inducing mistakes, all in a stadium filled to the brim with the most irrational, tribalistic dullards (I say this as a proud card-carrying dullard myself) cheering and jeering them along the entire way. Sure, the players are getting paid (a bit more), the commercial breaks are a little longer, and there are some new unfamiliar helmet colors in the conference, but the fans, the frenzy, the bands, the rivalries, the tailgating, the pageantry, and—most importantly—the chaos, remain as profound and pervasive as ever. If our day-to-day lives seem to be slipping into the dull deterministic “sim-to-end” world of predictability, then our favorite sport and its volatile pandemonium may be the perfect antidote.
Michigan is a 20+ point underdog in this game. But it’s not just any game. It’s The Game. There’s no “sim to end” for this one. The odds are long but so are four quarters. A win today would belie every single trend and data point we have on Michigan this season, but it would also be pure, uncut College Football.
Michigan 17, Ohio State 16

Raj, as usual, doing a great job of explaining something. This time it’s why cell phones have been a net negative for the world. We’ve never been fatter, angrier, and more mentally ill, and those phones have played a big part in how we got here. Before what makes college football what it is slips away even further , I’d love to see an intense, entertaining three hours that ends in a stunning upset.

I like Raj's version better. In 20 more years we'll simply choose which one of the ten thousand simulations we like best and watch that. Or let the AI choose for us. And we'll all go undefeated in our personal chambers.

Day as Drake is the best thing I have read in my entire life. Years ago “Ghostface” called Drake the softest rapper ever so the comparison is even more apropos

Drake is the perfect comparable for Ryan Day. And this corny rock country is the perfect anthem for the  endless blandness that is Ohio. But Raj, you are discounting the loss felt in our current situation. To the extent our window to the world is increasingly technologically-curated and commercially-defined within the confines a worldwide foolproof Skinner box, our epistemology dissolves into mush, the collective umwelt shrinks, and our spirits wither to the point where we are virtually defenseless against the exponential gishgallop of digital fraud. This is our concern, Dude. But a win for the good guys today will be a small point of light in the encroaching darkness. What matters the inexorable descent into cosmic and social heat death in a world where at least Michigan beats Ohio?

Gentlemen,
Chef's kiss to both of you for your columns on the penultimate (but most important) game of the season. Thank you for another sumptuous feast of words this fall, and I look forward to the dessert tray before the Bowl game (such as it is, and what there is of it).
