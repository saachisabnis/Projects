Taylor Swift reigns again on the U.K. albums chart with The Tortured Poets Department, and narrowly misses out on the chart double. 

	The leader at the midweek phase, Tortured Poets (via EMI) holds on for a second week atop the U.K tally, to become her fifth studio album to log more than one week at No. 1, the Official Charts Company reports.

Tortured Poets, Swift’s 11th studio album, joins multi-week leaders folklore (three weeks in 2020) and evermore (two weeks in 2020), Midnights (five weeks in 2022) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version) (three weeks in 2023).
