Wanted: a friend who knows how to extinguish accidental fires/is a song-writing genius. 
Taylor Swift has added some new friends to her inner circle over the past few years (rudely not me), including but not limited to Sabrina Carpenter and Gracie Abrams—which yep makes total sense considering they both got super close to Tay while opening the Eras tour. Check out a timeline of Sabrina and Taylor's friendship over this way, but today we're here to chat about Miss Swift's friendship with Gracie. 'Cause it turns out they have more in common than an ability to extinguish fires, kay?!
Exact dates are TBD, but Gracie told Vanity Fair that she got a call from "an unknown number" inviting her to Taylor's birthday in December 2021. The...DREAM!
Gracie also confirmed this fun fact to Rolling Stone in 2023, saying, "She texted me out of the blue like two Christmases ago. Like, 'Hey, it’s my birthday.' I was like, 'I know.' She’s one of the brightest lights ever, a writing genius, an artistic genius, angel from above."
Taylor announces the Eras tour, with....Gracie Abrams as one of her openers. 🤗 
Gracie talks about meeting Taylor for the first time, telling the Recording Academy, "It's like meeting an immediate best friend and also a superhero. You know what I mean? She's like the coolest person of all time. She is the warmest. She makes you feel like family instantly. And to have admired her and her work for my entire life, to also then be able to feel that way on a personal level is such a lucky, cool thing. And she's everything that you would ever hope she would be."
Gracie opens for the Eras tour in Los Angeles, dreams come true, etc.
Taylor and Gracie level things up by performing together:
Gracie tells Vanity Fair that “Every formative memory in my life is paired with a Taylor Swift song that helped me get through. My boyfriend the other day did the thing where we shuffled her discography and played a song for one second…I got them all.”
Gracie celebrates even! more! Eras tour!
Taylor and Gracie are spotted stepping out for dinner in NYC:
Gracie wishes Tay HBD!
...and then attends her party (along with every other famous person ever).
Gracie calls opening the Eras tour “the best experience of my life. To have that become a part of my weekly routine for four months straight has bled into kind of all ways of my life, not just how joyful I feel internally, but the songs that we’ve been making.”
Gracie tells Jimmy Fallon that she pretty much "blacked out" performing on stage with Taylor.
Gracie drops her new song "Us," which casually features (you guessed it) Taylor Swift:
Anddddddd she provides some BTS footage of them recording the song/accidentally lighting part of Taylor's kitchen on fire. You know, a typical night in.
FYI, Gracie told Today the backstory of this wild night, saying, "We drank a lot. We were talking about our lives and our albums and got really excited about all of these stories. She was like, 'We have to go home and listen to the songs'. She played me 'The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.' I end up on the floor. That's how that went and then we went home and wrote 'Us' based kind of off the conversation that we had at dinner."
Taylor brings Gracie on stage to perform their new song during the Eras Tour stop at London's Wembley Stadium.
Gracie gushes about how "magical" it is being in Taylor's orbit and the inspiring experience of song-writing with her.
Gracie commemorates her return to the Eras Tour with a lil clip on Instagram:
The duo's track, "Us" was nominated in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category at the 2025 Grammys.
A few days after Grammy noms, Taylor and Gracie perform a mashup of "Us" with "Out of the Woods" during the Eras Tour in Toronto. 
"You can't even imagine, like, the phone call between the two of us when the nominations came out and we saw that song was nominated," Taylor told the crowd. "It was just screeching. It wasn’t even words, it was just feral screeching for the entire call."
Taylor writes a lengthy Instagram caption to recap her Eras Tour stop in Toronto, where she drops a sweet shoutout to Gracie. " I got to play a mashup of the *Grammy nominated* song ‘us’ with @gracieabrams, mashed up with ‘Out of the Woods’ and I just adore her. She’s been giving the most amazing performances every night on this tour!!" Taylor wrote, in part.
Gracie joins Taylor on stage during the final night of the Eras Tour, where they perform a stunning mashup of their songs "I Love You, I'm Sorry" and "Last Kiss."
During Z100's Jingle Ball in New York, Gracie revealed she sent Taylor a "long, sappy text" for her birthday.
"I sent her a very long, sappy text this morning. I feel like every day is a day worth celebrating Taylor, but especially today," she told iHeart Radio. 
Gracie graces the cover of NYLON, where she gushes allll about Taylor and her time on the Eras Tour. “Every time I’ve opened for Taylor, I watch and learn. I learned from her every time we have a conversation about the weather, even,” Gracie said, adding that she's endlessly inspired by the "Fortnight" singer.
“I am inspired by Taylor in a million ways, but especially by the pace with which she puts things out into the world,” Gracie told the publication. “There’s less pressure the more you release — that’s how I consider it for myself. I want to just keep it coming while I’m in this period of writing as frequently as I am.” 
She also shared details about their final day on tour together, saying, “Everyone had been crying all day. It felt like the last day of school backstage…Everyone was walking around with their [Eras Tour] books, signing each other’s books. We were all walking around with Sharpies.” 
“I watched the live streams on shows that I wasn’t at…I’m feeling emotional and grateful and in a state of shock that we don’t, as a global community, get to experience that source of light anymore,” she added.
Gracie is the face of Chanel's spring/summer 2025 pre-collection, and naturally, she gushed about her Grammy nod with Taylor during a conversation with Sofia Coppola for Elle.
 “It’s such a crazy, full-circle thing to be nominated for a Grammy with Taylor, who I grew up idolizing. Especially all of her moments at the Grammys over the years have been so ingrained and burned in my head,” she told the director, adding that she had “a fun, squeal-y conversation on the phone” with Taylor upon receiving the news.
Gracie is Cosmopolitan's February digital cover star, and naturally, she gushed all about her friendship with Tay.
“I couldn’t be more different from Taylor. We are different in all the ways that my friends and I are different or that you and I are different. Taylor is an athlete, a brilliant businessperson, and a genius writer. She’s a grounded human being who makes time for everyone in her life,” Gracie said, adding that  “it’s been really cool to be in the orbit of a person like her.” 
She also praised Taylor and her iconic music career, saying, “There’s also nothing that comes close to what she has done. People will still gaslight her and her capabilities and all this shit. But please point me to one man who has come close to defining pop culture in this way. There is nothing! But people are not ready for that conversation.”
Oh, and she casually told us that she has, in fact, introduced boyfriends to Taylor before. Gracie also said she confided in her “Us” collaborator after some sore breakups.
“Last year when I was breaking up with my then-boyfriend, after talking to Taylor, I felt very backed by my decision. I felt deep support,” she revealed. “Talking to her helped me maintain my stance in the breakup. And, of course, her songs help me through any breakup. They’re all one big love poem.”
Stay tuned for more updates/we'll be living vicariously through this friendship 'til further notice.
