Sabrina Carpenter is very proud of the "boudoir-inspired" tour she continues to pour her heart into despite criticism from dissatisfied parents who attend her iconic "Short N' Sweet" shows.
The "Espresso" songstress recently sat down with Time Magazine to discuss fan reaction to tour choreography, her grandparents attending her most recent show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and more! 
"You’ll still get the occasional mother that has a strong opinion on how you should be dressing."
Despite firm opinions regarding the content of her shows, Carpenter revealed that she's quite fond of her performances, the clothes she wears, and the choreography she displays night after night. 
Fans were surprised to see Carpenter "embrace her sexuality (per NME)" during her MSG concert on Sunday (September 29) in front of her grandparents who attended the show. The artist was quick to shut down disproval, assuring that the only thing her relatives were paying attention to was the size of the crowd she brought to the legendary venue. 
"My fans online are like, I can’t believe she’s bending over in front of her grandparents! I’m like, girl, they are not paying attention to that. They’re just like, I can’t believe all these people are here.”"
The "Taste" hitmaker is slated to take the stage at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, on October 3rd as part of her next performance.
