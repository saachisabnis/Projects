As Election Day 2024 intensifies and voters continue to get their votes in, actress Anne Hathaway is encouraging those still waiting to vote to stay in line by singing her own rendition of Sabrina Carpenter's "Please Please Please."

Hathaway cleverly tweaked the lyrics, changing the chorus to "Please please please stay on the line / Especially in UPENN and Temple, just wait out your time / Voting is magic but also annoying / You waited this long, let's not make it boring."
As waits intensify following the post-work rush, Hathaway emphasized to her followers the importance of not abandoning the polls and staying the course. The Devil Wears Prada star confirmed she voted for democratic candidate Kamala Harris early Tuesday, noting "I voted like half of the country's lives depended on it."
