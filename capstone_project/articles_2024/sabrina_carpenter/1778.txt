Future notches his 11th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart — and third in 2024 — as Mixtape Pluto debuts atop the list dated Oct. 5. The long-teased set’s Sept. 20 release date was announced on Sept. 11. Mixtape Pluto earned 129,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending Sept. 26, according to Luminate, largely driven by streaming activity.

	Future scored two No. 1s earlier in 2024 with his two co-billed sets with Metro Boomin: We Don’t Trust You (a debut atop the April 6 chart) and We Still Don’t Trust You (also debuting at No. 1, April 27). The last act to notch three new No. 1 albums faster than Future — who has earned his three latest in a span of just six months — was the Glee Cast, which notched three chart-topping soundtracks in less than two months in 2010. If one discounted the Glee titles, as they were soundtracks and not traditional artist-driven albums, the last act to notch three new No. 1s as fast as Future was The Beatles in 1965-66. The Fab Four collected its fifth, sixth and seventh No. 1 albums also in a span of six months, as Beatles VI hit No. 1 on the July 10, 1965 chart, followed by the Help! soundtrack on Sept. 11 and then Rubber Soul on Jan. 8, 1966. (Since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March of 1956, no other solo artist has accumulated three new No. 1s as fast as Future.)

	










	With an 11th No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Future ties Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and Ye (formerly Kanye West) for the fifth-most No. 1s on the Billboard 200, dating to March 1956. Ahead of them are The Beatles (a record 19 No. 1s), Jay-Z and Taylor Swift (each with 14) and Drake (13).

	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200 chart, Chappell Roan scores her best week yet in terms of units and album sales, as The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess returns to its peak of No. 2 in the wake of promotion surrounding its first anniversary. Plus, Katy Perry lands her sixth top 10 with the arrival of 143, and Lil Tecca nabs his fourth top 10-charting set with the debut of Plan A.

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Oct. 5, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Tuesday (Oct. 1).

	Of Mixtape Pluto’s first-week equivalent album units of 129,000, SEA units comprise 118,500 (equaling 156.62 million on-demand official streams of the 17 songs on the streaming edition of the album; it debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 10,000 and TEA units comprise 500. The album was available to purchase either as a standard 11-song album (via download, CD and vinyl) or as an expanded 17-song album (download).

	Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess rises 3-2 on the Billboard 200 for a third nonconsecutive week at its peak position. The set earned 105,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week (up 64%) — it’s biggest week yet by units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise a career weekly-best 56,000 (up 328%; it’s also the top-selling album of the week, reaching No. 1 on Top Album Sales for the first time). The week-over-week growth is owed to the release of four new vinyl variants and a cassette tape in celebration of the album’s first anniversary on Sept. 22. Of the album’s sales, vinyl comprises 50,000 — easily Roan’s best week on vinyl and the sixth-largest week for any vinyl album in 2024.

Sabrina Carpenter’s former No. 1 Short n’ Sweet slips 2-3 on the Billboard 200 with 100,000 equivalent album units earned (down 7%); Post Malone’s chart-topping F-1 Trillion is a non-mover at No. 4 (53,000; down 12%), and Morgan Wallen’s former leader One Thing at a Time is steady at No. 5 (53,000; up 2%).

	Katy Perry lands her sixth top 10-charting effort on the Billboard 200 as her new studio album 143 debuts at No. 6. The set earned 48,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week ending Sept. 26. Of that sum, album sales comprise 37,500 (her best sales week since 2017), SEA units comprise 10,000 (equaling 13.11 million streams of the album’s songs) and TEA units comprise 500. The album’s first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across eight vinyl variants (including a signed edition), four CD variants (including a signed edition), a cassette tape and multiple digital download variants (including two exclusive to her webstore, each with bonus tracks).

	










	The album was preceded by a trio of songs, including its first single, “Woman’s World,’ which reached the top 30 on the Pop Airplay, Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary radio charts.

	Taylor Swift’s chart-topping The Tortured Poets Department falls 6-7 on the latest Billboard 200 (47,000 equivalent album units; down 9%), while Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft is steady at No. 8 (45,000; up 2%).

	Lil Tecca captures his fourth top 10-charting set on the Billboard 200 as Plan A arrives at No. 9 with 42,000 equivalent album units earned — his biggest week by units since 2019. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 28,500 (equaling 40.45 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs), album sales comprise 13,500 (his best sales week ever) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The set’s sales were aided by its availability in two CD variants (including a signed edition) and multiple digital download variants (including three exclusive to the artist’s webstore, two of which included bonus tracks).

	The album was preceded by a pair of charting songs on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs: “Number 2” (peaking at No. 45) and “Bad Time” (No. 25).

	Closing out the top 10 of the new Billboard 200 is Noah Kahan’s Stick Season, falling 9-10 with 38,000 equivalent album units earned (down 1%).
