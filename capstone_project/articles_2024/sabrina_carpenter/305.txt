That's that me espresso! Sabrina Carpenter appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert where she talked about her recent Grammy nominations and more ... and challenged the late-night host to an espresso martini chugging contest!
After welcoming Carpenter on his show, Colbert offered Sabrina an espresso martini to celebrate the occasion. And after taking a sip, the singer said, "That is very good. Should we do a chugging contest?" Colbert accepted Sabrina's challenge, and after a quick cheers, the two began chugging! The outcome? Well, the "Espresso" singer lost to her opponent, noting, "That's so terrifying how fast you drank that."
Then, as Colbert asked Sabrina about her Grammy nominations, before answering, she admitted, "I'm very drunk now."
Elsewhere in the interview, Sabrina opened up about her love for Paul McCartney and the song that made her fall in love with the Beatle. She explained, "When I was very, very young, my dad played me 'Rocky Raccoon' for the first time and I was so mesmerized by that song and the songwriting of it all that I fell in love with Paul McCartney."
In fact, Sabrina was so infatuated, she was convinced that McCartney would be her future husband. She recalled, "I was convinced that was my husband, my future husband. But he was quite old, and I was so young. I didn’t understand that he was much older than me because I was looking at all these photos." Sabrina added, "I didn’t understand math. I was a child."
