What does every tortured poet have besides their typewriter? A nice li’l cup of “Espresso.” Sabrina Carpenter’s No. 1 on the Billboard “Hot 100” will have to wait a few more weeks as her professor, Taylor Swift, takes the top 14 spots with the release of The Tortured Poets Department. “You’ve outdone yourselves, this is unbelievable,” wrote Swift on Twitter on Monday — presumably she also said this while looking in a mirror. This is Swift’s second time dominating the top-ten spots, and she is the only person to do so; the first was with Midnights in 2022. Fan favorites (and potentially Eras Tour additions) include “Down Bad” at No. 2 and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” at No. 3. But what does “Espresso” have to do with any of this?

While Tortured Poets has knocked every other song out of the top ten, “Espresso” still has a chance for a refill. Last week, Carpenter’s song rose to the No. 7 spot, making it her first top-ten hit. Plus she’s broken into the top five across the pond in the U.K. and could possibly hit No. 1, reports Charts. As for back in the States, Talk of the Charts is predicting “Espresso” will move up to No. 2 right behind “Fortnight” next week. Isn’t that sweet?
