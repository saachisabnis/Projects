"I wanted the song to sound quite chaotic, it's basically my story squished into three and a half minutes"
Jade Thirlwall has released her debut solo single, ‘Angel Of My Dreams’ following Little Mix‘s hiatus in 2022.
Following in the footsteps of her former bandmates – Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson – Thirlwall has launched her solo career with the three-minute pop track. It was written in Los Angeles alongside Steph Jones – who worked on Sabrina Carpenter‘s ‘Espresso’, Pablo Bowman (Calvin Harris) and producer Mike Sabbath (RAYE).
“You only care about money (Money) / Sellin’ my soul to a psycho / They say I’m so lucky / Better act like you’re lucky, honey,” she sings in the first verse of the track, which has been described as a “shape-shifting banger”, while referring to her love/hate relationship with the music industry.
Speaking to Capital, the singer shared: “The song is basically about my love/hate relationship with the industry, which, as we know, I’ve been a part of for quite some time.
“So, I’ve got a little bit to say about that, the good and bad. I wanted the song to sound quite chaotic, it’s basically my story squished into three and a half minutes.”
Thirlwall previously told Beat that she had originally wanted the single to sound like a “loving relationship that was toxic”, but decided “No, let’s let them have it; let’s tell them what it’s about in the verses.”
Angel Of My Dreams is officially out in the world and I don’t know whether to cry or laugh or shit myself 😂 This song means everything to me –  my love/hate letter to the music industry, telling my story from the beginning of my journey to now.https://t.co/7mL8Lri4fS pic.twitter.com/wV3ZQFZ8pZ

The song’s accompanying music video features Thirlwall in 11 different looks with the singer sharing “The concept is sort of rags to riches, and it was emotional actually, because for one bit I’m busking and walking past a Sainsbury’s Local. When I was 16, I would stand outside my local Sainsbury’s and sing Christmas songs,” (via Capital)
The video features a cameo from Fontaines D.C. frontman Grian Chatten sporting a lime green tracksuit, the same one he wore in the video for the band’s single ‘Starburster’. The scene in which he appears was also featured in the band’s video where Chatten is seen walking into Thirlwall’s video shoot before walking into the dressing rooms and changing into an all-white outfit and angel wings.
Elsewhere, earlier this year, Perrie Edwards released ‘Forget About Us’ her debut solo single. Speaking to NME about the creation of the track, the singer shared: “I was just so insecure, I think, I was just so shy. And it’s really a drastic change when you go from being in a girl-group and having your girls constantly with you holding your hand – I was literally the baby [of the group]. And it can be quite overwhelming when there’s loads of people in a room and you’re supposed to be talking about your feelings and your emotions and what you want to put in a song.
As for Leigh-Anne, she recently confirmed she will embark on her first headline tour in venues across the UK and Ireland this October.
Having recently performed an intimate headline show at London’s Lafayette, the former Little Mix member has expressed her excitement as she begins her solo career and plays additional dates this autumn.
The new tour dates come on the heels of the release of recent single ‘Stealin’ Love‘, the first in a collection of songs she’s set to release soon. Visit here for a list of dates and to purchase tickets.
