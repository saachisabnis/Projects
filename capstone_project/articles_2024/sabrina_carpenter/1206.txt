Amazon may be the loudest when it comes to events like Black Friday, but it’s not the only retailer in town. As you emerge from your post-turkey stupor, the Walmart Black Friday deals should be on the top of your shopping list. We find they’re are always comparably priced to what you’ll see at the everything store, and there’s at least a brick-and-mortar component to its sales if you want to show up in person and eyeball something IRL. These days, in-person shopping isn’t your only option, and you no longer have to elbow your way in to snag any of the savings the retailer has to offer. We’ve got the intel you need to make the most of your early Black Friday sale shopping, so make sure your laptop’s battery life is topped up and your browser is primed to open a bunch of new tabs.
Whether you’re getting some holiday shopping done early, scheming about which smart TV will distract your parents this Christmas, or you want to shore up your Wi-Fi connection or snag a cordless vacuum for pesky holiday messes, Walmart’s Black Friday deals have you covered. As all sales go this time of year, prices will only be marked down for a limited time, so take advantage while you can (oh, and don’t wait until Cyber Monday).
Walmart
A Dyson vacuum cleaner (very good, yet very expensive) is a quintessential Black Friday buy that you save up for and then pounce when it’s on sale. The V15 Detect is one of Dyson’s greatest cordless vacuums, highlighted by the detangling head and illumination technology that lights up all of the dust in your path.
Walmart
Sonos and Walmart are also rolling out deals on portable speakers, discounting the Roam 2 just in time for holiday hosting. Drown out the noise coming from your air fryer with some holiday jazz or Sabrina Carpenter. No doesn’t matter what you play, it’ll sound great on the Roam 2.
Walmart
A Drew Barrymore–designed boucle chair for $100 off? Sign us up. This comfy accent chair comes with three pillows, swivels 360 degrees, and is stain-treated against errant spills and messes.
Walmart
Adirondack chairs never go out of style, so even if you’ll be gazing at it lovingly out your window all winter long, buy one now so it’s ready to go when spring comes. At less than $100, you’d be losing money if you didn’t buy a couple of these.
Walmart
Cocoon by Sealy makes one of our favorite mattresses in a box, so we can confidently say that buying one of these while it’s marked down is well worth it. A queen is only $357, a pretty wild deal that rarely comes up—even during the myriad mattress sales that go on throughout the year.
Walmart
Be prepared for winter weather with a portable power station like this one from EcoFlow. It has a 1800W AC output, which means you can power more than 90% of your home appliances or plug in up to 15 devices at once.
Walmart
Winter weather also means dry air. Keep your sinuses free-flowing and your home smelling like a fancy yoga studio with a cool mist humidifier that can also diffuse essential oils. This one can run for 32 hours on a full tank and will humidify a room of up to 300 square feet.
Walmart
One thing that can easily ruin a holiday dinner: undercooked meats. The Meater Pro 2 ensures that you cook the turkey, beef, or chicken to the perfect temperature before plating it. Hook it up to your phone’s Bluetooth and monitor the temperature from your couch.
Walmart
If you’re looking for over-the-ear headphones that don’t cost as much as Apple’s AirPods Max, the Beats Solo 4 are a premium alternative. They use the same chips as the Apple AirPods and have spatial audio that pairs nicely with your Roku TV or Xbox console to maximize your TV and gaming experience.
Walmart
If you’re all set on TV deals but still want to boost your at-home entertainment setup, the Sonos Beam 2 is an addition that will boost your sound quality regardless of what TV you already have, be it a Sony, a Hisense, a TCL, or some other smart TV.
Walmart
Send a text, make a call, tune up your favorite podcast, or even check your heart rate with this smart watch (one of our top picks for pricey gifts that are worth the splurge).
Walmart
Gone are the days of waiting in endlessly long lines for that TV you’ve been eyeing. Skip the trip to the store and save big on this best-selling smart TV from LG. Backed by more than 1,000 five-star reviews, it gets high marks for the quality of the picture, easy setup process, and solid price—which is even more solid at $150 off.
Walmart
We love a stick vacuum, but everyone could use a robot vacuum for hands-free cleaning—especially when holiday hosting is on the calendar. This one can hold up to 60 days worth of dirt and debris, and it self-empties into a bagless base…aka there’s no need to take multiple trips to the trash. When you’re out and about, you can schedule cleanings on the SharkClean app, or ask Alexa or Google Assistant to get it moving.
Walmart
Save yourself a coffee run this Christmas (and every day thereafter) with another Black Friday favorite: the Keurig. Pop in a pod, press a few buttons with your preferences, and wait for a fresh cup of joe. This model brews five cup sizes (four, six, eight, 10 or 12 ounces), makes iced drinks, and has a hot water setting to pour out hot water for anyone who prefers tea.
Walmart
Or take your tunes to go with the JBL Clip 4, a super small waterproof speaker with an integrated carabiner to hook onto a bag. It has 10 hours of battery life with just one charge, and there are seven discounted colors and patterns to choose from.
