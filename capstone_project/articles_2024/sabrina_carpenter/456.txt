Fans of Sabrina Carpenter will get an early present later this year when she drops her very first holiday special.
On Thursday (September 19), the "Espresso" singer and Netflix revealed they are teaming up for Carpenter's first-ever holiday special, A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter, which will drop this December. She and the streaming giant announced the project in a joint post on Instagram, featuring the musician decked out in a sparkling red bodysuit and fur-trimmed boots asking, "Expecting someone else?"
"This is really gonna jingle your bells," the caption states. "A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter — her first-ever holiday special — features unexpected duets and comedic guests you will not want to miss!"
Carpenter, who also recently teased a potential collaboration with another pop star, also reshared the clip on her Instagram Stories expressing her excitement for the holiday season, writing, "me eager asf for Christmas."
The news comes days before Carpenter sets off on her Short n' Sweet Tour, which kicks off September 23 and will take her all around the U.S. with some additional stops in Canada. The tour follows the release of her latest album of the same name, which features singles like "Espresso," "Please Please Please" and "Taste."
A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter will be available to watch on Netflix starting December 6 at 9 p.m ET/6 p.m. PT.
