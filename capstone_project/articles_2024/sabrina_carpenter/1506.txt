Sabrina Carpenter has had quite a year! The former Disney star topped the charts with her pop hits, opened for Taylor Swift on the international Eras tour and performed on New Year’s Rockin’ Eve. While we can’t get Carpenter’s music out of our head, it’s her beauty routine that has really broken the Internet recently. We can’t scroll through TikTok without seeing someone recreating the “Nonsense” singer’s Barbie-esque glam (think: flushed pink cheeks and darker lips). And now we know exactly what lip gloss Carpenter uses to achieve her perfect pout.
It’s the Hourglass Phantom Volumizing Glossy Balm! In a new video posted by Who What Wear, the Girl Meets World alum shared what’s in her everyday makeup bag. “These are my essential-essential-essentials if I’m going out and need all the things that I will use,” Carpenter said, before holding up the Hourglass gloss. “It’s such a beautiful, sheer, glossy finish and it doesn’t look too heavy or matte. It almost looks like you just bit your lips and that’s their natural flush color. This is in the shade Desire.”
