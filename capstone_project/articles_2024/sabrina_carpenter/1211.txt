Addison Rae came prepared to make a point at Variety’s Power of Young Hollywood event on Aug. 8, dressing up in sharp peep-toe mules from Jimmy Choo and a velvet top with a conical bustier.
The “He’s All That” star attended the event celebrating Sabrina Carpenter, Sadie Sink and Marcello Hernandez. Rae opted for a distinctive ensemble, including skin-tight, high-waisted velvet pants in a warm shade of burgundy. She complemented the pants with an eye-catching lavender velvet crop top featuring ruched fabric and thin traps. The focal point of the outfit was the top’s unmissable bustier, adding significant dimension with a pointy conical design.

Rae slipped into a pair of burgundy shoes from Jimmy Choo to further embolden her fashion statement last night. Known as the Maryanne 100 patent leather mules, the peep-toe shoes featured a pointed sole and a glossy upper with a V-shaped outline in lieu of a curved vamp. Rae was given additional height with a 100 mm thin heel that widened into a square base. The shoes were backless, keeping the design relatively minimalistic and offering the musician and actress less restriction. The heels are available for $850 from Net-A-Porter in shades of burgundy and blush.
The heeled mule is a popular summertime trend, blending casual and formal design elements for an easy yet chic footwear look. Ariana Greenblatt recently wore a black leather pair with cutouts from Thom Browne for an appearance on “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” Her “Barbie” co-star Margot Robbie turned heads at Wimbledon this summer in a black peep-toe version of the style from Alaïa.
Additional guests at the Power of Young Hollywood event included Joey King, Laufey, Lukas Gage and Lizzy McAlpine, among other young people in entertainment.
