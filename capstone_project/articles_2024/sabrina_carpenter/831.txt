Her final US shows were also filled with mouth-trumpet competitions and fans showing off their gymnastic skills 
Clairo has ended her North American ‘Charm’ tour in support of her latest album and closed it out with a fan rap battle.
The indie pop singer wrapped up her US tour last night (December 18) after a three-night run at Massey Hall in Toronto, Ontario – which was rescheduled after she had postponed the dates back in October citing “extreme exhaustion”.
The final three gigs saw Clairo interact with fans, with the first night (December 16) seeing her invite a fan onstage to perform a cartwheel into a split which the attendee stuck but in doing so, ripped her trousers. The gymnastic skill was far more tame than the previous trend that took over her gigs that saw fans do backflips on stage.
Perfect tour. Thank youTo my band and crew and everything in between To everyone who showed up ❤️I love you to the moon
See you in February !

During night two (December 17), a select handful of attendees were brought onstage for a mouth trumpet competition in honour of Clairo’s viral clip of her performing her song ‘Juna’ on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in which she performed a mouth trumpet bit during the track.
To close out the three-night run and the North American leg of the ‘Charm’ tour in its entirety, Clairo invited four fans to partake in a rap battle. The freestyle cypher was accompanied by the singer’s backing band who provided a soft, smooth groove for the battle.
The highlight of the night’s battle was when one fan spat out the bars: “Then we got you /I don’t wanna be rude /But you should go to someone else for your tattoos,” leading the crowd to erupt in cheers.

Earlier during her tour, Clairo called out the male attendees of her shows to “stop yelling” at her and “be respectful” to other crowd members.
After her show in Portland, Oregon back in October, the ‘Sexy To Someone’ singer took to her official X/Twitter account and tweeted: “Portland was fun! Can the guys at my shows stop yelling at me :).”
She continued: “To be clear, it’s fine that men enjoy my music. U don’t have to be embarrassed that U like my music. But when u come to my shows at least be respectful of me and other people in the audience! Thank you.”
The singer’s most recent release was her third album ‘Charm‘. In a four-star review of the LP, NME shared: “While desire might be the main focus of ‘Charm’, it’s also an ode to connection and the comfort that comes with that – whether it’s fleeting or long-lasting, with a romantic partner or just other loved ones in your life.
“‘Glory Of The Snow’, the gorgeously wintry penultimate track, pays tribute to the support of others. “When I cry, I wanna give you a ring,” she shares. “I can breathe with you right there alone with me.” In the end, that’s what the desire of ‘Charm’ boils down to – the yearning to see and be seen, to be with people who not only want you back but understand you and make life that little bit easier to make it through.”
In other news, Clairo is set to embark on the UK and European leg of her ‘Charm’ tour in March 2025. She is also slated to perform as a guest at Sabrina Carpenter’s BST Hyde Park 2025 headlining show. Check out a full list of tour dates below and visit here to purchase tickets.

Elsewhere, ‘Charm’ landed the 17th spot on NME‘s 50 Best Albums Of 2024 list, with Alex Flood writing: “Clairo has always written introspective pop songs about basic human desires such as acceptance, love and connection. But on third album ‘Charm’ – from body image bop ‘Sexy To Someone’ to smooth ballad ‘Nomad’, concerning an imagined late-night hook-up – she finally felt confident enough to spell out her own wishes a bit more forcefully.”
Her song ‘Sexy To Someone’ also earned the 34th spot on NME‘s 50 Best Songs OF 2024 list, with Flood sharing: “On her first two albums, Clairo crafted cosy and complex indie-pop songs – the kind of woozy, melodic tunes that instantly put you in a state of happy calm. With this funky standout of her more assertive third record ‘Charm’ – all catchy hooks and rhythmic basslines – she proved she could get us up and dancing, too.”
