Please, please, please leave Barry Keoghan alone. After deactivating his Instagram on Friday night, he returned to X with a statement asking fans and strangers to be “respectful” of him and his loved ones after his name was “dragged across the internet” since his breakup news with Sabrina Carpenter dropped on Tuesday. “The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent, and every other inhumane thing you can imagine,” Keoghan wrote on December 7. “Dragging my character and everything I worked extremely hard for and stand for. Talking about how I was a heroine baby and how I grew up and dragging my dear mother into it also. Knocking on my grannies door. Sitting outside my baby boys house intimidating them. Thats crossing a line.”
Since Tuesday, when the news of the breakup was first reported, internet sleuths began claiming that Keoghan cheated on Carpenter, with some suggesting he cheated with influencer Breckie Hill, which may have been a reason as to why he’s been on the receiving end of so much hate. “I need you to remeber he has to read ALL of this about his father when he is older. Please be respectful to all Thank u,” Keoghan concluded.
