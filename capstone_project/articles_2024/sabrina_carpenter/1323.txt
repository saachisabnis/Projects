Attn: @ Swifties!!! Coachella is right around the corner and the buzz surrounding which celebrities will make an appearance is reaching a fever pitch. Enter: Fans eagerly speculating whether Taylor Swift and our fave football player Travis Kelce will attend, while the more delulu ones (read: me) are out here manifesting that she ends up being a surprise guest performer IRL. 🕯🕯🕯
Does the Tom Hiddleston era really count at this point??? Help.
Alexa, play “...Ready for It?”
Correction: screaming!
Luckily, sources have been feeling ~chatty~ and are opening up about the likelihood of the hitmaker and pro athlete making their way to the desert (hint: it's looking pretty 📈📈📈).
“They both want to see Lana Del Rey and [Jack Antonoff’s band] Bleachers,” one insider recently dished to Us Weekly. (JFYI, both Lana and Jack are some of Tay's closest friends and collaborators, so it definitely makes sense why she'd want to watch them perform at Coachella.)
Apparently, the couple will be “renting a house in the area” for one of the two festival weekends, which run back-to-back on April 12-14 and 19-21. A second source who spoke with the outlet noted that Travis is planning on shooting a commercial in Los Angeles the weekend of April 12, which definitely means he'll be 1) close to Tay and 2) close-ish to Indio, California, where the event is set to take place.  
As for what Tay or Trav themselves have said re: the likelihood of them attending? “I am a Coachella guy,” the footballer recently dished to People. “I love going to Coachella. I love live music in general. So you might see me pop up over there at some point.” That! Said!!! Travis *also* mused, “I'm not sure if I'll go to a weekend, one or two, or if I even have time knowing my schedule's filling up pretty quick before we get started back up for football here.”
Taylor, for her part, has kept mum about being present at Coachella, but she *does* have an ample amount of reasons (aka musical acts) to consider going. Besides seeing Lana and Jack, both Ice Spice—who joined Tay in the Super Bowl suite, was a surprise guest on the Eras Tour, and collaborated with the celeb on a remixed rendition of “Karma”—and Sabrina Carpenter—who is currently the Eras Tour opening act—are set to perform at this year's event!!!!!
FYI, Taylor showing up for Coachella 2024 would be a Huge Freakin' Deal, since her last appearance at the festival dates back to 2016. Dubbed “Bleachella” by fans due to her bleach-blonde hair at the time, Tay's Coachella debut coincided with her then-boyfriend Calvin Harris headlining the event. And, yes, to say we're still stuck on 2016 and fully not over this cultural reset is a serious understatement:
Travis, on the other hand, has been a regular at the festival in recent years, and even attended with his best friend Aric Jones and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Thankfully, the footballer has fully documented his trips to the desert, meaning that even years later, we can still look back at his “Brochella” days lol.
Now if you'll excuse us, we're off to make friendship bracelets in the event that we end up running into our fave couple at the festival. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
