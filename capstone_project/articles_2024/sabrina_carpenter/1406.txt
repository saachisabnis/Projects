"Is Sabrina Carpenter your niece?" Nancy read the question in her latest TikTok video. "Yeah, absolutely. Isn’t that amazing? When you find out that somebody that… maybe you’ve known me for a little while doing this 10-year-old boy for like 35-something years … [When you] find out that I’m related to this superstar," she said.
"The rumors are true! Sabrina Carpenter is my niece!" she wrote in the caption, making fans excited for the latest discovery. "Sabrina Carpenter is related to Bart Simpson, Ay, caramba!” one person wrote in the comments, while someone added, "But why does Sabrina being related to Bart Simpson make so much sense??? it really is a family attitude."

The singer has previously worked as a voice actor, having voice roles on Disney Channel’s Phineas and Ferb, Sofia the First, and Milo Murphy’s Law.
