Listen, we never thought we’d say it either, but hear us out: Bubble dresses (and skirts) aren’t just back in the conversation—they’re everywhere. We spotted the 2025 fashion trend on the spring-summer runways at Simone Rocha and JW Anderson, just to name a few labels. Zendaya cosigned the look late last year, and we just named it one of the key dress trends of the season. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, it’s officially time to give this balloon look a go.
Last seen en masse at the tail end of the aughts, bubble skirts once signaled preppy, moneyed glamour. (It’s no surprise, then, that Princess Diana famously wore a striped puffball dress in the ’80s, the first heyday of the voluminous silhouette.) While the look still carries those connotations—prep is having a major moment this year, after all—it’s shifting into something lighter and more refined. (No offense to your prom dress.)
Styling bubble dresses takes very little effort: Midis and maxis call for mixed-metal earrings, and strappy heels or ballet flats. Minidresses, meanwhile, leave plenty of real estate open for statement jewelry, knee-high boots, and trendy bags. If you go with a bubble skirt, try a tank top and sheer tights. And the cloudlike silhouette is great for dressed-up events like spring weddings and birthdays; throw on a pair of kitten heels and sweep your hair into an updo before you head out.
