During each show on Sabrina Carpenter‘s Short n’ Sweet Tour, the chart-topping pop superstar “arrests” someone in the crowd for “being too hot.” During Tuesday night’s (October 22) performance in Atlanta, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown was the latest hottie to be taken into “custody” by Carpenter. “I’m really distracted right now because I see this gorgeous girl,” the 25-year-old singer said from the stage. “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up. This girl is so hot.” In fan captured footage of the exchange, Carpenter asked, “Who are you, what is your name?” as the arena’s camera revealed Millie Bobby Brown in the crowd. A caption of “you’re under arrest for being too hot” was displayed over Brown’s face, as the actress enthusiastically received her fuzzy pink handcuffs. “I’ve never fallen in love at a concert before but stranger things have happened,” Carpenter said to complete the well-executed bit.
