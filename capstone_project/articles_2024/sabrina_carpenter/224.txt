Sabrina Carpenter gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at her time on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.
The “Feather” singer – who joined the global superstar as an opener in South America, Australia and Asia – shared a snap of herself at the Sydney Zoo with Swift during a day off.
“That’s a wrap for us on the eras tour :’),” the former Disney Channel star, 24, captioned an Instagram post Saturday. 
“Sitting at home reflecting on what a whirlwind this was and how very honored I feel to have been part of it. I want to thank every crowd for being so welcoming and generous to us and making some of the most impressive friendship bracelets I’ve ever received,” Carpenter went on, before thanking Swift personally. 
“The most thank you’s I’ve ever thank you’d to Taylor. I feel so lucky to witness the magic that is you and this tour. There is truly no one like you and there never will be! I love you with all my heart and I will cherish this taybrina era (and all the eras) till the end of time 💞💞💞,” she concluded. 
One of the candid photos showed the “Girl Meets World” alum walking beside the “Cruel Summer” songstress, 34, during their day off in Sydney. 
The two became close throughout their time on the road, grabbing dinner together in Australia and even performing a sweet duet of Swift’s hit ”White Horse.” 
The 14-time Grammy winner’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, wasn’t pictured. However, he notably joined the duo for a day at the zoo when he jetted Down Under following his third Super Bowl win. 
“The kangaroos were pretty sweet. I got to see a red panda up close and personal,” he told his brother, Jason Kelce, during an episode of their “New Heights” podcast earlier this month. 
“I saw a crocodile, which is f–king way bigger than an alligator,” he went on, before detailing his experience with Australia’s native koalas.

“[We fed] the eucalyptus leaves to koalas. They weren’t doing anything. They were just chilling. That’s what koalas do. They just chill.”
The Kansas City Chiefs player also attended one of his girlfriend’s Sydney shows last month, where he was spotted waving to fans, singing along in the VIP tent and even giving out guitar picks.
“Sydney did not disappoint. I’m pretty sure the crowds over there are — well, they’re already rowdy. The Australians are pretty rowdy. They like to have a good time. I like to have a good time,” the tight end said.
“Shout-out to Australia for showing up, showing out.”
