	The lineup for Coachella 2024 is set and includes a No Doubt reunion, with the band performing together for the first time in almost a decade.

	The music and arts festival is set to take place over two weekends: April 12-14 and April 19-21. Lana del Rey, Tyler the Creator and Doja Cat are headlining the music festival. Other artists confirmed include Peso Pluma, Blur, J Balvin, Bizarrap, Sabrina Carpenter, Deftones, Ice Spice, Sublime, Grimes, Bleachers, Carín León, DJ Snake, Suki Waterhouse, Lovevoy, Tinashe, Jon Batiste, Jhené Aiko, Lil Yachty, Bebe Rexha, and Mean Girls star Reneé Rapp, among many others.

	No Doubt teased their reunion earlier in the day in a video shared on social media that had Gwen Stefani texting her bandmates to hop on a video call. The band all agree to hang out and do a show together, with the lineup to Coachella dropping a couple of hours later. 

	The presale for Coachella starts Friday, January 19 at 11 a.m. PT, with the official site suggesting that for the “best chance at passes,” look at Weekend 2. General admission passes start at $499 (plus fees) for Tier 1 and go up to $599 (plus fees) for Tier 3. For those festival-goers looking for a VIP experience and have access to exclusive areas, the passes start at $1,069 (plus fees) for Tier 1 and $1,269 (plus fees) for Tier 2. The passes allow entrance to the festival for all three days of the chosen weekend.

	YouTube will live stream the live performances on both weekends.
