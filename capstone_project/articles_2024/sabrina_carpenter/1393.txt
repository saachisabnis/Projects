On Friday’s album release day for Short n’ Sweet, the highlight of Sabrina Carpenter’s entire day might be her impromptu interview with Judi Jupiter. The one-time house photographer for Studio 54 stopped the pop superstar on the street to have a quick chat during her TikTok Live video. The trouble is, Jupiter didn’t know who Carpenter was, and had no idea how popular the singer is. Jupiter encouraged Carpenter to share her social media handles to promote them, though Sabrina doesn’t need any help there, with more than 22 million followers on TikTok and nearly 39 million on Instagram. 
But Carpenter enjoyed the interaction, asking, “What kind of content do you–“ before Jupiter responded, “I do really cool people in Soho. All the hot girls in Soho, and in Fire Island.” Jupiter then led a quick back and forth, “You’re spectacular. Did you just come out with an album?” “I did. Today.” “What’s the name of it?” “It’s called Short n’ Sweet.” “By?” “Sabrina Carpenter. Me.” Jupiter then suggested that Carpenter, “Say hi to my followers.” “Hi to your followers,” Carpenter said, before telling Jupiter, “I’m obsessed with you, honestly.” (Billboard)
