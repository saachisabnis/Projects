In the first week, the show's glitterati make their debuts alongside their professional dance partners, each vying for a spot on the leaderboard with their initial dance routines.
Tasha, teamed with returning professional dancer Aljaz Skorjanec, took to the Strictly stage with a riveting Cha Cha set to Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso". It wasn't just the crowd that was left in awehead judge Shirley Ballas lavished praise on the performance.
 Following her critique, Shirley heaped further acclaim by saying: "You're on your way to have one of the most spectacular leg actions I think I have ever seen on the show.", reports the Mirror. To which Claudia replied with admiration, describing Shirley's comments as "extraordinary". Meanwhile, audiences at home feel certain Tasha will be claiming the glitterball triumph.
