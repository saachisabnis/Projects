"What a fucking honour, I love you"
Adele embraced Meryl Streep at her show while dressed as her character from ‘Death Becomes Her’ – check out the footage below.
The ‘Hello’ singer was playing the latest in a run of shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Friday (November 1) and was dressed up for Halloween as Madeline Ashton, Streep’s character in 1992’s Death Becomes Her.
The cult classic horror comedy has had something of a renaissance recently, particularly after Sabrina Carpenter, who Adele praised earlier this year, released the video for ‘Taste‘, in which she and Jenna Ortega reference the film throughout.
At Friday’s show, the singer spotted Streep midway through performing ‘When We Were Young’, and said a quick “hello” before embracing the actress. “What a fucking honour,” she shouted, adding: “I love you” before continuing with the song – you can watch fan-shot footage below.

It’s not the first time Adele has spotted one of her idols while performing. Last Saturday (October 26) – notably at a venue originally built for Celine Dion‘s 2003 residency –  she saw the legendary diva in the crowd and promptly broke into tears.
Later referencing the moment on Instagram, Adele wrote: “I have been performing in Celine Dion’s room at the Colosseum for almost 2 years now. 4 weeks to go! It was the only venue I wanted to play in Vegas because it was built for her.
“I have a picture of her right next to the stage that I touch every night before I walk on and she came to the show this weekend and it was a surprise and it was a MOMENT!!”
Six dates remain on the ‘Weekends With Adele’ run of Vegas shows, with the final coming on November 23. After that, the singer has said she will be going on an indefinite hiatus, which caused tickets for the final show to skyrocket in price, with some going for over £18,000.

Ahead of the break, Adele has played a slew of shows, including a 10-date residency at the purpose-built Messe Munchen arena in Munich. During one performance, she took a moment to praise Chappell Roan, calling the rising singer “absolutely amazing”. “She is spectacular, and it turns out, she’s not just got one song,” she said. “She’s got, like, seven fucking brilliant songs.”
Elsewhere, The Maccabees have recalled the time when she supported them at a pre-COVID show in London.
