Kelly Clarkson put a country twist on Sabrina Carpenter’s first No. 1 single.
Clarkson delivered her rendition of “Please Please Please” on The Kelly Clarkson Show on Wednesday (November 13). The song appears on Carpenter’s latest full-length album, Short n’ Sweet. The 12-track record also includes “Taste,” “Espresso” and other highlights. Clarkson said it was “shocking” that Carpenter hadn’t scored a No. 1 hit before “Please Please Please,” which Clarkson always envisioned as a country song.
“Ever since I heard this song, for some reason, I hear like Dolly Parton singing it as well,” Clarkson said after her performance. “For some reason, it lends itself to country for me, so I asked my band if we could make more of a country version of it because we have the amazing pop version already. But I love that song, and I love when a song is so good that you can kind of go into different genres with it. But thank you, Sabrina, for that song. Thank you for letting me sing it.”
Clarkson has previously performed country songs on The Kelly Clarkson Show, including by Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Brooks & Dunn, Reba McEntire and many others. Watch her put a country spin on Carpenter’s “Please Please Please” here:
