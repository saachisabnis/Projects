Christmas and Hanukkah are only a few weeks away. I asked Yahoo gifting editor Amanda Garrity about what’s on people’s lists this season.
Amanda: Overall, I’m seeing the brand-new Meta Quest 3S and Our Place Wonder Oven getting lots of attention. Yahoo readers have also been loving light-up beanies, magnetic grill lights and candle warmer lamps in our main Christmas gift guide.
Amanda: Personalized gifts from Etsy, Mark & Graham and Minted should be ordered stat. And if you’re shopping for kids or teens, I wouldn’t wait to buy Squishmallows or Jellycats — they’re already hard to track down and we’re still a couple of weeks out.
Amanda: White elephant: These duck lamps have been selling. They’re silly but useful. Legos are a great option too — I love this $40 tiny plant set. Secret Santa: Games are always fun. Monopoly Deal and UNO are popular, and Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is an Amazon bestseller at just $10.
