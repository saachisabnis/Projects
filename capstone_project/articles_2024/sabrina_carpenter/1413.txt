Shirts have been rendered irrelevant Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Katy Perry is currently in Paris for Fashion Week (much like every other celebrity â€“ 
Sabrina Carpenter, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid, to name just a few), and her outfit at the Balenciaga Haute Couture show can be best described as 'what you wear when it's 30 degrees out, but you're also freezing from the AC being on all day.'
And by that, I mean she showed up in nothing but a ripped-up pair of shoe tights, no shirt or bra, and an open oversized jacket. And she looked incredible, tbh!!! Seriously, only Katy could pull this look off.
She previously gave a look at those washboard abs when she dropped the cover art for her new single 'Woman's World' wearing just a tiny crochet bikini and giant metal robot legs but the dangerously low rise on her tights have us begging for the ab routine.
Elsewhere in her new KP6 fashion era, this ~lewk~ comes just a few days after Katy walked in Vogue World wearing a leather cut-out naked dress constructed from diamond-shaped panels. As one X, formerly Twitter, user joked, "Katy Perry on her way to save pop music" in reference to the power of her strut combined with her new naked aesthetic.
And yesterday, she showed up at the Ritz  wearing a dress with the longest train e-v-e-r, printed with what appeared to be lyrics from her upcoming single "Womanâ€™s World."
We've got all the details plus fan reactions to the look here.
Katy also went on Instagram Live with fans while wearing the dress (she had the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop, casual) and chatted about her new music, saying "Yes, there are features on the album, and they're super fun and some you know some you might be introduced to." 
Already seated for this era, tbh.
