RAYE, Sabrina Carpenter, David Guetta and more will take the stage at Wembley Stadium this summer
A staple in Londonâ€™s summer festival circuit, Capitalâ€™s Summertime BallÂ (with Barclaycard) is back with a bang. This summerâ€™s ball is the first with Capitalâ€™s all-new breakfast team (Jordan North, Sian Welby and Chris Stark) at the helm â€“ and itâ€™s apparentlyÂ set to be â€˜one of the best Summertime Balls ever.â€™
This yearâ€™s Summertime Ball line-up is looking as huge as ever (consisting of David Guetta, Becky Hill, Perrie and RAYE, to name a few), and 80,000 ticketsÂ will go on general saleÂ this week. Donâ€™t want to miss out on one of the summerâ€™s biggest parties? Hereâ€™s all you need to know.
This yearâ€™s ball is taking place on Sunday June 16.
The star-studded lineup for this yearâ€™s show will take to the stage atÂ Wembley Stadium.
General sale for the ball goes live tomorrow, on Wednesday May 1 at 9am on Global Player, Capitalâ€™s official app. Make sure you have downloaded the app so that you donâ€™t miss out on tickets. You can try Ticketmaster, too.
The pre-sale, open to Capital listeners logged into Global Player, went live today (April 30).
Weâ€™ll update this page when we know the specific prices for this yearâ€™s event.Â 
As a benchmark, tickets in 2022 ranged from Â£56 to Â£106. Keep an eye on Ticketmaster for full details.
Yep, you can do that through the official hospitality partner,Â Seat Unique.Â PackagesÂ get you things like premium seats,Â arrival via the hospitality entrance, premium dining options and other cool things.Â Find out more here.
The lineup this year is full of chart-topping stars, such as:
