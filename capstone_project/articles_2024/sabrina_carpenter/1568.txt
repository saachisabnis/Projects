Amy Allen from Maine, has a great chance of filling her cabinet with Grammy Awards.
The Portland Press Herald reported that Amy was recently nominated for four Grammys: Song of the Year, Album of the Year, Best Song for Visual Media, and Songwriter of the Year. I'll be watching our Mainer on CBS on February 2, 2024.
Amy has written hit songs for some of the biggest artists around: Sabrina Carpenter, Tate McRae, Oliva Rodrigo, and Justin Timberlake to name a few. She was also a co-writer on all the songs on Carpenter’s huge album 'Short n’ Sweet,' which was also nominated for Album of the Year. What's the best song for visual media? That's from the song 'Better Place' from the movie 'Trolls Band Together!'

The Waynflete School graduate already has a Grammy from last year's Album of the Year by Harry Styles, 'Harry's House,' which she worked on. She was also nominated last year for the first time for songwriter of the year. Hopefully, she will pick up that Grammy this year.

She lives in Los Angeles full-time but has family in Maine and is often back here. She is also a very talented singer in her own right. Her first solo album as a singer was released in early September called 'Amy Allen' with 12 songs she wrote and performed.
Amy is a special person. Her talent is only outshined by her humility and grace. I've had the pleasure of meeting Amy a few times and seeing her perform. If you ever get the chance, don't miss it.
