Camila Cabello smashed a laptop on stage during her 2024 MTV Video Music Awards performance on Wednesday night (September 11).
The pop singer-songwriter, 27, began her performance with a video that captured Cabello with her former platinum blonde look. Returning to her darker locks, Cabello delivered a stunning rendition of “GODSPEED” when she paused the video playing on the laptop and moved to the forefront of the stage at UBS Arena in New York City. The ballad is the first song Cabello wrote for her new album, C,XOXO, she said as she debuted the “GODSPEED” music video and C,XOXO (Magic City Edition) earlier this month. By the end of her performance, Cabello threw the laptop to the floor.
Cabello was one of many artists to take the stage during the epic annual show, which honors the most iconic videos and moments in music throughout the year. Other performers included Chappell Roan, GloRilla, Halsey, Lenny Kravitz, LL COOL J, Megan Thee Stallion, Sabrina Carpenter, Fat Joe, Eminem and more. Katy Perry also delivered a career-spanning medley when she was honored with the Video Vanguard Award, introduced by husband Orlando Bloom.
