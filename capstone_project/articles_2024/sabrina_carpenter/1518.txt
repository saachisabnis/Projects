Beyoncé may be a global superstar, but she’s still got time to keep up on what’s current in music — and her tastes in contemporary Hip Hop are running to GloRilla, Doechii and That Mexican OT.
In an email back-and-forth with GQ that was published on Tuesday (September 10), Bey shared what she’s been listening to these days.

“I love and respect all of the female singers-songwriters who are out right now.… Raye, Victoria Monét, Sasha Keable, Chloe x Halle, and Reneé Rapp,” she began, before moving on to Hip Hop.
“I love Doechii and GloRilla, and I just heard That Mexican OT, he’s from Houston…. He goes hard!” she continued. “I really like ‘Please Please Please’ by Sabrina Carpenter, and I think that Thee Sacred Souls and Chappell Roan are talented and interesting.”

The superstar admitted that she spends “most of my time” listening to classic r&b.
“[L]ike Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and music from artists on the Stax label,” she specified, shouting out the documentary Stax: Soulsville USA.

Elsewhere in the interview, Bey revealed the significance behind the name of her latest album Cowboy Carter — and it goes deeper than just its country sound.
The “Texas Hold ‘Em” hitmaker explained that she wanted the title to be a teachable moment for fans about the often buried history of Black cowboys in America.

“I wanted everyone to take a minute to research on the word cowboy,” she said when asked about her decision to name the album Cowboy Carter instead of Cowgirl Carter. “History is often told by the victors. And American history? It’s been rewritten endlessly.
“Up to a quarter of all cowboys were Black. These men faced a world that refused to see them as equal, yet they were the backbone of the cattle industry. The cowboy is a symbol of strength and aspiration in America. The cowboy was named after slaves who handled the cows.

“The word cowboy comes from those who were called boys, never given the respect they deserved. No one would dare call a Black man handling cows ‘Mister’ or ‘Sir.’”
This unfortunate reality also inspired the name of Bey’s new whisky brand, with the singer adding: “For me, SirDavis is a sign of earned respect. We all deserve respect, especially when we give it.”
