Sabrina Carpenter has announced her sixth studio album.
'Short N' Sweet' will arrive on August 23, following up 2022's 'Emails I Can’t Send', a subsequent deluxe edition of that record, and her 2023 Christmas EP, 'Fruitcake'.
She previously teased the project with the single Espresso in April, and more recently the pop singer shared that she has a surprise coming this Thursday (June 6).
The American vocalist will play New York's Governors Ball and the Capital FM Summertime Ball in London in June.
