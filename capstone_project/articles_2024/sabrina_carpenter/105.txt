Music superstar Sabrina Carpenter kicked off her highly anticipated 'Short n Sweet Tour' in the United States. The tour excited not only fans but also some celebrities who didn't want to miss her show, starting with Selena Gomez, who brought some friends to the New York City concert, including her "Emilia Perez" co-star, Venezuelan actor Édgar Ramírez.
Thanks to a post made by Selena herself on her Instagram account, fans saw the former Disney star enjoying the concert while singing and dancing to Sabrina's song "Juno." The video was accompanied by a simple caption where only Selena's producer and partner, Benny Blanco, was tagged.

Although the video got people talking because of Selena's dance moves, the real news would come later when a video showing Selena dancing with Ramírez went public.
In this second clip, the Emmy-nominated actress is seen together with him, along with model Connar Franklin and Ariel Taylor, in what appears to be a box at Madison Square Garden, where the event took place.
What caught people's attention was the peculiar dance between Selena and Édgar during the song 'Espresso,' one of Sabrina's greatest hits. In it, both actors are seen dancing very closely with the Venezuelan actor holding Selena by the waist, showing what's known in Latino social media as Los pasos prohibidos, or in English "the forbidden moves."

While the dance lasted less than ten seconds, reactions were quick to arrive. In the comments accompanying a TikTok user's post, fans were surprised and confused by what was happening between the two Latin artists.
Some people went so far as to suggest supposed infidelity on her part, to which her fans came to her defense, arguing that Selena was just having a good time with her friends. Not to mention that in the full video, Édgar is also seen dancing with Ariel.
The best part of the whole thing is Benny's response to her video dancing by herself: "I can't keep my hands to myself," referencing to Selena's 2015 song.
Many were surprised by Selena and Ramírez's dance and bond, especially since the actress publicly shared her select group of friends through social media, and fans didn't register him before.
The Venezuelan actor and Selena met while filming the movie Emilia Pérez, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2024. The film, presented by France to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, tells the story of Rita (played by Zoë Saldaña), a lawyer who must help a Mexican mafia boss disappear while becoming a trans woman.
Since then, they have been seen at various events to promote the film and on friendly outings, including Sabrina Carpenter's concert and, a few months ago, Beyoncé's.
