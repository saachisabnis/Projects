It’s no surprise to anyone that Ashley Park loves to send voicenotes
The Emily in Paris season four finale left us with one of the biggest plot twists ever: She’s finally leaving Paris! Many things in the season’s second half shocked fans, such as her new gorgeous Italian man, her amazing new job and a brand new city to explore. Lily Collins is just as – if not more – excited than Emily herself. The Emily in Paris star spilled all the juiciest production secrets in an interview with Buzzfeed, and some of them are pretty wild.

Starting off the Emily in Paris production secrets is more of a funny fact: Lily Collins is a woman of many talents, but skiing apparently isn’t one of them. She told Buzzfeed it was “more like falling” than skiing for her, and that “there’s a lot of outtakes” which are “hilarious.” She did actually have to fall down the mountain in the shot, but she ends up meeting someone at the end of it, so I guess her falling skills were put to good use.

Lily revealed that the episodes are shot “mostly in order.”
“Sometimes they’re writing the episodes as we’re there. So at the beginning of the season, we don’t have all 10 scripts to read. We have the first few. And then as we’re experiencing the city and we’re finding the characters that year, the writing is happening in real time,” Lily told Buzzfeed.
This was news to me – I genuinely thought they all knew how it would end from day one on set. It kind of adds some authenticity to Emily though, because even she doesn’t know what path she’s going to take yet!
Two of the biggest plot reveals from season four, without spoiling too much, involve a wedding and a baby. Before the show was even filmed, Lily thought there was “no way” these could both be true: Little did she know she’d be wrong. She said “I think people assume that we just know, but we don’t” – they’re completely in the dark too.

Emily has had some pretty crazy storylines over the seasons, and nobody knows that better than Lily. She revealed one of the best Emily in Paris production secrets which was that she actually gets input into how Emily’s character develops.
“I’ve definitely been in conversations with all of our other producers, showrunner Darren (Star), and of course the writers and helped give my opinions and thoughts,” she said.
“Also with casting decisions, which is to me one of the most important things when you’re dealing with chemistry with people. And also just the way that you see Emily’s changes in her own personality and what she gravitates more towards and just being an active viewer myself of other shows and kind of understanding character arcs and like where would I wanna see Emily go? But also who do I wanna see on screen? And what kind of stories do I wanna tell?”
Lily said the food in Rome was the best food she ate on location, and that affogatos are her new favourite thing given that you need “the right gelato and the right coffee” and in Rome, “you get both.” Brb putting this on my bucket list!
Emily’s had some very questionable outfits considering the fact she lives in the fashion capital of the world – they’ve caused international outrage online. Lily has put her foot down on outfits before, but also been pleasantly surprised once she put on an outfit she originally thought wouldn’t be Emily’s vibe.
She also said she loved to lean into Marilyn Fitoussi’s aesthetic, and her general “geniusness.”
When asked about an Emily playlist that gets her into character, Lily confessed that Emily would love the top 40 or any big pop hits. It seems Emily is a big pop girl stan who would jam to “Dua Lipa, Lizzo, Sabrina Carpenter and Beyoncé.” She “loves an anthem,” and I can’t not agree.

To nobody’s surprise, the most active cast group chat is between Lily and Ashley Park. Lily gushed that “no matter where we are in the world, we’re sending each other things. Ashley is big on voice notes and sometimes it’s just her laughing, which makes me laugh because she’ll just send a voicenote and I’m like, ‘Oh, what is this?’ And it’s just her laughing at whatever I just said.” That’s a group chat I NEED to be in.
She also acknowledged that Samuel Arnold is “great with some memes.” I bet they’re hilarious!

One of the main themes of the show is the cultural differences between the French and American. Lily said she’s definitely into “taking longer time for meals,” but she just can’t deal with a nine o’clock dinner time, because she’s already “in bed.” She spends a lot of the time convincing people to do “an early bird special” when it comes to cast meals. Not very Parisian of you, Lily!
