Sabrina Carpenter surprised fans at Taylor Swift's Eras Tour stop in New Orleans!
According to USA Today, during her "secret set" part of the show, they note she started to sing Sabrina's "Espresso." After a couple lines she asked the crowd if they liked it - of course they did! Taylor then pulled out her phone and called Sabrina asking her if she was in town! 
Of course, Sabrina was and just a moment later she popped out on stage! 
The two sang a mashup of their hits and fans on social media, and in the crowd, went wild!
