Tom Smith is the hair whisperer. He predicts the future of cuts and colour in his seasonal trend reports, so when he declares that ‘the set’ is back, taking Sabrina Carpenter as the inspiration, Team Metro are desperate togive it a try as soon he can get us at the backwash.
For many Gen-Xers like me, getting a ‘set’ is a throwback to our gran’s weekly visits to the hairdresser where wet hair would be put in rollers, doused in setting lotion and then she’d sit under a hooded dryer with a copy of Woman’s Realm for an hour until her hair was curled, crisp and even. 
But what does it mean to Gen Z? ‘A big, blowout similar to how my grandmother’s 1960s hairstyle would look with hairspray, hairspray and more hairspray,’ says 23-year-old Metro reporter Lucia Botfield.
So with Lucia’s long hair and my shorter cut – not to mention our different interpretations of a set – we head to Billi Currie’s salon in Marylebone where Tom works as International Artist, to see if it will work for us.
The first thing he does is make it clear that The Set 2.0 is definitely ‘not the same’ as we imagine.
‘I’ve modified the modern set to make hair look healthy with movement so you can see the texture and bounce while it holds the shape,’ Tom explains. ‘It also looks fuller so ideal for hair that is thinning.’ 
No setting lotion, no hooded dryer, not even wet hair these days – so what is the technique? 
‘I use dry hair and create ‘invisible’ rollers formed with an heated curler and then use tiny clips to pin it and leave it for thirty minutes depending on the length and thickness of the hair,’ says Tom. 
The difference of a set to a blow-dry is that ‘with a blow dry I start with wet hair and dry with the flow of the movement of your hair,’ he adds. ‘I take dry hair from hot to cool allowing the hair to set because that’s when the bonds of the hair are malleable so I can transform your hair to however you want to wear it.’   
However, unlike the old days, this is not about longevity. Tom emphasises that the look isn’t going to last a week – sorry grandma, but it was helmet hair – although it will retain the shape for maybe a day or two longer. 
One thing I was keen to know, was why this look had become a trend again. ‘Health and wealth signalling is the macro trend in hair and beauty, which everyone now knows is harder and more expensive to achieve,’ explains Tom. 
He’s reluctant to reveal his celebrity clients, but when I twist his arm – not my finest moment given his has a hot curling iron in his hand –  Tom tells me they include Geri Halliwell and Louise Redknapp.

But can his magic work on mere mortals like us?
With clean dry hair, I jump into the chair announcing I want to look like Marilyn Monroe –  seeking my inspiration from the current  Marilyn The Exhibition.  But given that the length of my hair reaches the nape of my neck, Tom told me before the appointment that it’s too short for that look – I could end up looking like Mrs Thatcher, he warns. 
Even so, I know I’m in very safe hands; my last cut was with Tom who gave me the La Dolce Vita Crop, one of his trends for this season that he describes as ‘softly tousled, strong yet un-fussy’, now seen on Florence Pugh and Kristen Scott Thomas. And me.  
Tom conjures up the ‘invisible’ rollers without so much as an ‘abracadabra’ but with a GHD Curve Classic Curl Wand, used because of my shorter hair,  which is wrapped around in small cylinder spools held with a small clip.  
‘Rollers put a lot of tension on the roots, which helps with volume but creates a stiff look,’ he says. ‘Whereas invisible rollers support the hair and create shape but keep the natural movement and bounce.’   
My head of hair is prepped in 15 minutes, sprayed with Evo Builders Paradise Working Hairspray and while I wait for the set, the baton is passed from Gen X to Gen Z, with Lucia ready to see how it will look on her luscious, long red violet hair.   
‘Given I normally straighten my hair plus it is the day of the work Christmas party, my nerves have intensified tyring something completely new,’ she admits as she settles into the chair.

Following the same technique, Tom tongs her hair with GHD Curve Soft Curl for more modern bounce and curls and there is a blast of Olaplex Volumising Blow Dry Mist for Lucia’s hair to set.   
Then I am ‘unpinned’ and I look like a 20’s flapper so I’m overjoyed until Tom brushes out my hair and I am staring at Margaret Thatcher. 
Thankfully, equilibrium is restored as Tom brings out the curls and waves and the set is unlike any another style I have had with a blow-dry; far more defined and glamorous. 
From Mrs T, soon I feel as close to Ms Monroe as I shall ever be. Though there is a lot of hairspray which does feel strange but given the style which I love, I get over it because the volume on top makes my face longer and the movement at the side I like to think raises my cheekbones.  
As for Lucia, Va Va Voom! ‘I strutted back to the office with a spring in my step,’ she tells me later, adding, ‘and the style brought in a few Jessica Rabbit comparisons – which I wasn’t complaining about.’ 
As for longevity, the office knees-up could not be more of a test. 
‘The hair-do lasted very well for a night of intensive drinking and partying. The next morning, although it had lost a lot of its shape, there were still some strong curls,’ Lucia reported back.  
Is she a convert to the modern set?  ‘Yes, for a special occasion, which I think keeps the novelty of the style.’ 
As for me, I didn’t have a late night of partying and my set lasted well till three days later.  
I did find the amount of hairspray a bit uncomfortable, but then I normally only use a serum. It did make me wonder how my grandmother’s hair, who I would estimate used half a bottle of Silvikrin a week, felt like.  
Still, over a simple blowout, it is a brand-new look winning hair, set and thatch.
