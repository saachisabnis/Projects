Like so many of us, Sabrina Carpenter was embarrassed to share her Spotify Wrapped — but it wasn’t because she didn’t want to advertise that she was listening to uncool music. It was because she didn’t want to advertise that she was listening to herself.
Speaking to Vogue, Sabrina says, “I did. It’s funny because when I first saw mine, my initial reaction was, ‘Oh, damn, I can’t post that, because I’m on my own [list]. It’s a bit conceited.’”
But she reconsidered, after realizing that being happy with her own work isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
“I was like, ‘I guess it’s a good thing that I’m on my list and listening to my own music, because it means I f*** with what I do,'” she notes. “But the other [artists on my list] were Dolly Parton, ABBA, Kacey Musgraves, and the Bee Gees.”
Sabrina also spoke to Vogue about starring in the new campaign for Versace Biggie eyewear, but she said she doesn’t want to glam it up this holiday season. 
“Honestly, I really hope to be in pajamas the whole time. But if I do leave the house, which I did the other night, my main request was that I really wanted to wear something that wasn’t sparkly, just because I wear so many damn sparkles on stage all the time,” she says.
“I’m constantly in a sparkly number, so I want to do the holiday season in a different way. I save the sparkles for New Years [sic].”
