THIS NEW HOLLYWOOD “IT COUPLE” WAS SEEN OUT THIS WEEKEND AT LUNA LUNA AND I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS
OVER THE WEEKEND SALTBURN ACTOR (AND MY LATEST CELEB OBSESSION) BARRY KEOGHAN WAS SEEN OUT ON A DATE WITH SABRINA CARPENTER.
SABRINA IS 24, BARRY IS 31…FEELS LIKE THE PERFECT AGE GAP IMO
(LUNA LUNA IS THAT ART AMUSEMENT PART WAS THAT LOST SINCE 1987…AND DRAKE WAS PART OF THE EFFORT TO PUT IT ON DISPLAY. IT RUNS THROUGH SPRING ON 6TH STREET IN BOYLE HEIGHTS)
BUT I WANTED TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO THESE 2 AS A COUPLE.
BARRY KEOGHAN IS A LIBRA AND SABRINA IS A TAURUS.
OVERALL…THEY HAVE A 33% SUCCESS RATE…
BUT I WENT DEEPER TO FIND THAT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THESE 2 SIGNS IS WHAT IS THE WORST (5%)
IF THESE 2 CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRULY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER…THEY COULD BEAT THE ODDS!
