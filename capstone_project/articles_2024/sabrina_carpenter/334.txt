It’s been an eventful week for Taylor Swift. Her new album “The Tortured Poets Department” comes out Friday, April 19, and despite announcing it after winning the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal album, she hasn’t spoken about it much aside from some of her Eras Tour performances and announcing different variants of the album with exclusive bonus tracks.
Taylor Swift has launched a pop-up in Los Angeles for her new album “The Tortured Poets Department” The popstar is partnering with Spotify to create an interactive experience for fans ahead of her new album “The Tortured Poets Department” which comes out April 19. The Spotify Library installation is open to the public and available to view April 16-18 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on 1st and Bow St at the Grove outdoor mall in Los Angeles, California.

After the Coachella lineup was announced in January, speculation emerged about Swift’s potential attendance and possible guest performances. It timed perfectly with a break in performances for her sold out Eras Tour. Her friends and collaborators Lana Del Rey, Jack Antonoff, Sabrina Carpenter and Ice Spice were all set to perform. And her boyfriend planned to attend this year. Surely if she didn’t come out on stage to sing a song, she’d at least go and support her friends?
Sure enough, on Saturday, the “Getaway Car” singer was spotted backstage with boyfriend Travis Kelce at Coachella, supporting her friend and collaborator Jack Antonoff during his band Bleachers’ set at the Mojave Tent.

Shortly after, the pair made their way into the crowd to watch Ice Spice perform at the Sahara Tent. Ice Spice hyped out the crowd by saying “Shout out to Taylor Swift” before the rapper performed “Karma (Remix)” that she’s featured on, as Swift watched the performance among fans, including her former tour mate Sabrina Carpenter.

On Monday, Swift’s marketing plan for her new album seemed to go pedal to the metal when various fan experiences emerged across the country and on social media. In Chicago, a QR code wall mural was painted using the acronym for her upcoming album, “TTPD,” as well as her favorite number, 13.  When scanned it takes fans to a YouTube Shorts video with the message “error 321”. On Apple Music, songs had random capitalized letters to indicate a secret message. And in Los Angeles, a library installation was installed in partnership with Spotify at the Grove mall.
so you know how we’ve been saying there’s going to be trial/investigation themes throughout #TSTTPD? the fonts and staggering of words/letters throughout the TTPD promo reminded me of stenographers/court reporters.. aka the person who takes notes during a trial @taylornation13 pic.twitter.com/IJfDIdgZYG

Swifties showed up in typically Swiftie fashion, early and prepared, posting updates to social media as the experience was being installed, as early as 5 a.m. TikTok user Alex Day, with the handle “repudaytion” appeared to be the first fan to make their way to the Grove. The Swiftie began documenting as the experience was being built to let fans know what they could expect.

Fans took to social media to share that the pop up seems to be filled with possible clues and Easter eggs for Swifties to decode ahead of her 11th studio album.
Birds? Gold cages? A calendar? Number two?? Tayloooor what that means!! #taylorswift #thegrove #ttpd #torturedpoetsdepartment #tpd @Taylor Swift @Taylor Nation 
 ♬ Style (Taylor’s Version) – Taylor Swift 
Notably, this is the first album from Swift where she has not released a single ahead of the album, making fans even more eager to experience the pop-up for crumbs of information.

someone said this is giving morgue and pointed out it could be 'I hereby conduct this post-mortem autopsy', that's because she's doing an examination of everything that died within the relationship!  last song released was you're losing me (I can't find a pulse) OMG #TSTTPD pic.twitter.com/1pWFaK9OT6

This is Diana of Ephesus, she is the goddess of childbirth and fertility and the goddess of the moon.

Puzzle pieces in jars, bird cages with dried lavender, a perpetual calendar set to Friday, December 13, books open with possible lyrics that change throughout the day such as “Even statues crumble, if they’re made to wait,” and a letter from Swift, or “The Chairman of the Tortured Poets Department,” as it’s signed.
“And so I enter into evidence
My tarnished coat of arms
My muses, acquired like bruises
My talismans and charms
The tick,
tick,
tick
Of love bombs
My veins of pitch black ink
All’s fair in love and poetry
Sincerely,
The Chairman
Of the Tortured Poets Department”
Note: There appears to be a typo in the above lyrics. “Talimans” should be spelled “talismans,” however with Swift’s background of leaving clues we’ve opted to leave the lyrics as is.
