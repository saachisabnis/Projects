‘This seems so regressive and icky’
Sabrina Carpenter unveiled her Halloween outfit at her show in Dallas last night. She dressed up as a Playboy Bunny, and the people are not pleased.

She also posted a TikTok of her Halloween fit. She’s wearing a black sparkly bodysuit, bunny ears and a bowtie, like the Playboy Bunnies of yore. In the TikTok, she poses in a dressing room and lip syncs to audio from the 2008 movie House Bunny.
Sabrina Carpenter looks as fire as always, but some social media users weren’t so sweet on her Halloween outfit.
Several felt it was disrespectful to dress up as a Playboy Bunny for fun now that so many former Playboy models have spoken out about how they were exploited by the brand. In the recent documentary series Secrets of Playboy, loads of former Playboy employees said they’d been sexually assaulted. Crystal Hefner, the wife of Hugh Hefner (who founded and ran the company) wrote a memoir about feeling “imprisoned” in the Playboy Mansion.

Reddit users were pretty unimpressed with Sabrina Carpenter for her choice of Halloween outfit.
One wrote, “This seems so regressive and icky. In the documentary, most Playboy models said they were abused and exploited by Hef. Playboy/Hef also built their empire off of leaked nude photos of Marilyn Monroe. She never consented to them being used and never got a dime. Sabrina – this is NOT it, girl.”
A Reddit user said, “Oh no is the Y2K era Playboy-as-feminism coming back? Every popular girl in high school wore Playboy bunny merch (or had logo tattoos!)”
Another wrote, “I appreciate her commitment, even though the bit is tired and regressive. Starting to feel like we’re trending backward culturally.”
“Maybe it’s just me, but I really don’t get it,” said a Reddit user,” she’s subverting the sexualization of women… by appeasing the male gaze?”
“She looks beautiful, but after her tour girl needs to catch up on some Playboy documentaries,” someone wrote.
