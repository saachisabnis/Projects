Taylor Swift’s tour opener Sabrina Carpenter traveled from Singapore to Los Angeles just to make Oscars night—and have her event debut with her boyfriend, Barry Keoghan. The couple confirmed their relationship while posing together at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. Carpenter wore a black Tory Burch dress with a transparent skirt. Keoghan, meanwhile, was dapper in a tweed jacket and black pants.
Carpenter and Keoghan posed on the official red carpet at the same time but not together:
The two stars had been sparking dating rumors for some time. Keoghan was seen in Singapore watching Carpenter’s Eras Tour show performance. She was even filmed running into his arms after one.
Keoghan returned to Los Angeles this week and wore a friendship bracelet with “Sabrina” on it, another clear nod to his partner. He was most recently seen wearing it last night at MPTF’s 22nd Annual Night Before party:
In early February, Carpenter spoke to Maya Hawke for Interview about how, just two years before, she’d been far from being in a happy relationship.
“I was at a really, really low point in my life about two years ago, so I was writing very few optimistic love songs,” she acknowledged. “That one [“Nonsense”] always stuck out, but I felt like it might discredit some of the songs on the album [Emails I Can’t Send] that were about more sensitive subjects, so it almost didn’t make it in. People in the past had told me my music didn’t have symmetry, that I didn’t have every song sounding the same, and that got in my head. So I’m grateful, because the fans decided on their own that it meant something to them.”
