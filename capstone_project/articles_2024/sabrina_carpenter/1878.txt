For celebrities at Coachella, the party doesn’t stop when the last performer finishes their set. Ashlee Simpson, Victoria Justice, Alix Earle and more stars hit up the Desert Nights by TAO Group Hospitality afterparty during the first weekend of the iconic festival.
From Friday, April 12, to Sunday, April 14, performers like Lana Del Rey, Tyler, The Creator, Sabrina Carpenter and more stars stunned audiences during the Indio, California festival.
The music didn’t end there, though. TAO’s invite-only afterparty featured performances by artists like Skepta, Martinez Brothers, Kaskade and DJ Tennis, drawing in VIPs including Carpenter and Barry Keoghan, Harry Jowsey, Alessandra Ambrosio and more.
Earle — who recapped her Coachella experience on her podcast, “Hot Mess” — stayed hydrated with the help of the aesthetically pleasing Poppi activation.
Travis Kelce was spotted dancing with his friends during the afterparty’s closing performance by Adriatique. Alesso also joined the EDM duo backstage during their set.
Simpson and Evan Ross took date night to the desert! The couple coordinated with black jackets, while Simpson donned khaki pants and accessorized with a shimmering, silver purse.

TAO Group Hospitality kept the party going for Weekend 2 of Coachella (April 19-21). With performances by RÜFÜS DU SOL (DJ set), SG Lewis, Dom Dolla and John Summit, the second weekend of the Desert Nights afterparty drew in celebs like Dillon Francis, Diplo, Klay Thompson, Dave Grohl, Gryffin, Alesso, Jimmy Tatro, Pasquale, Damon Albarn (Blur) and Camilla Cabello.
Cabello, fresh off her surprise performance with Lana Del Rey at the festival, hit the dance floor at Desert Nights with celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta.
“This was TAO Group Hospitality’s biggest activation to date at Coachella,” Pavan Pardasani, the CMO of TAO Group Hospitality, said. “With very successful back-to-back weekends behind us, working with incredible brand partners like Poppi and PATRÓN was great to bring our event to life. We had some great performances lined up for both weekends and a handful of musicians and DJs who came to unwind at Desert Nights. We can’t wait to welcome everyone back next year.”
