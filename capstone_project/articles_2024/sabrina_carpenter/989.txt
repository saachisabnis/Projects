Amanda Seyfried is rooting for Sabrina Carpenter to join the cast of the next ‘Mamma Mia!’ movie.

The 38-year-old actress starred as Sophie in the 2008 musical film and its sequel ‘Here We Go Again’ 10 years later, and Seyfried has now revealed she wants the pop star, 25, to appear in the third picture if it ever gets made.

When ABC News asked the Hollywood star whether Carpenter could play her daughter in the movie even though the singer was only 13 years her junior, Seyfried said: "You know what? Old age makeup for me. That’s what it will be. … I’m an actor. I’ll do it. 

"If Sabrina Carpenter wants to play my daughter, I’ll make it happen. It’s fine. She’s … I’m a big fan."

When asked for an update on the possible third ‘Mamma Mia!’ instalment, the ‘Mean Girls’ actress admitted she hadn’t seen a screenplay yet, but emphasised that "everybody says it’s gonna happen".

She said: "‘Mamma Mia! 3’, let’s go baby.

"Everybody says it’s gonna happen. But I mean, I haven’t seen a script."

In August, Seyfried’s co-star Christine Baranski revealed that producer Judy Kramer was currently working on a third entry in the series.

She told The Hollywood Reporter: "I was in London with Judy Kramer at our favourite watering hole, she is planning ‘Mamma Mia 3’. She gave me the narrative plotline of how it’s going to happen. That’s all I can say! 

"But, it’s not like, ‘Oh, I wish it could happen!' Judy Kramer makes things happen."

The previous two movies featured Hollywood giants like Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard and Meryl Streep, and Baranski believes that the producer has the pulling power to reunite the star-studded cast for another outing to the Greek Islands.

‘The Good Fight’ star explained: "[Kramer] made number two happen, and it was a phenomenal hit. I wouldn’t put it past Judy Kramer to get everybody back together."
