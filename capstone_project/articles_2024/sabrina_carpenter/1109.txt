Sabrina Carpenter's boots were made for...running!
The "Please Please Please" artist fearfully sprinted off the stage during her set at San Francisco's Outside Lands music festival on Sunday (August 11) after being struck by a stray firework. 
According to TMZ, the dazzling songstress was debuting some moves with her dancers to close out an action-packed performance when she ran to the back of the stage where a handful of fireworks suddenly ignited. Video footage obtained by the outlet shows the pyrotechnics sporadically shooting across the stage near Carpenter as she starts shrieking. She continues to scream as she runs off the stage with her dancers right behind her. 
The "Espresso" songstress looks to be unharmed as she seeks refuge backstage. The next day, Carpenter took to Instagram to share photos from the festival including her iconic Nancy Sinatra cover of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" with queen Kasey Musgraves, and solo snaps of her capturing the hearts and attention of all concertgoers. The standout was sure to thank her cast and crew in the caption, but didn't mention anything about the firework incident.
Fans took to the comment section of the post in concern stating, "Sabrina girl are you okay? You scared us with your screams at the end of the show with the pyrotechnics," and "Our polly pocket was NOT prepared for the pyro and fireworks at the end of the show."
The "Nonsense" star has yet to comment on the incident as she readies for the release of her forthcoming album, Short n' Sweet, out August 23rd!
