	It’s been a few years since she was popping and locking on TikTok — now, we’re the closest we’ve ever been to witnessing Addison Rae’s breakthrough pop star moment. After first capturing the ears of pop listeners with “2 Die 4” and her audacious remix of Charli xcx’s “Von Dutch,” Rae has unleashed “Diet Pepsi,” her major label debut single.

	Arriving on Aug. 9, “Diet Pepsi” pulled over 3.05 million official on-demand U.S. streams in its first week of release, according to Luminate. That number rose by 4% the following week (Aug. 16-22), collecting over 3.17 million streams. Although its third week of release (Aug. 23-30) is not yet complete, “Diet Pepsi” is already on track to once again rise in week-over-week streaming activity. From Sunday (Aug. 25) to Monday (Aug. 26), the Elvira-produced track jumped 20.5% in streaming activity, going from approximately 537,000 streams to 647,000 streams.  “Diet Pepsi” is currently playing in around 95,000 posts on TikTok, helping the track reach No. 8 on their Viral 50. The song has also topped Spotify’s USA Viral 50 chart and earned over 2.4 million YouTube views for its official music video. With a few dance trends seeking to truly take off, “Diet Pepsi” is off to a formidable start on streaming that could potentially lead to the social media star’s first commercial hit. – KYLE DENIS

	The nearly impossible, the previously unthinkable, is happening: Oasis has announced a reunion, with Liam and Noel Gallagher re-forming the British rock group that made them famous after 15 years and countless verbal jabs at each other. And over the past few days, U.S. music listeners have toasted the unlikely comeback by revisiting (or discovering) the band’s back catalog, nearly quadrupling their daily audio streams in the process.

	“Espresso” reigned as one of the songs of the summer, “Please Please Please” topped the Billboard Hot 100 and “Taste” is her latest smash – but Sabrina Carpenter isn’t letting up anytime soon. On the heels of the release of her new LP, Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter is eyeing an impressive fourth hit from the record.

	“Good Graces” — an Ariana Grande-esque kiss-off jam produced by John Ryan and Julian Bunetta – has been getting a lot of attention on streaming, easily becoming one of the most-consumed album tracks upon the album’s full release (Aug. 23). In its first day of release, “Good Graces” earned nearly 3.5 million official on-demand U.S. streams. While the song has yet to cross the three million threshold in the days since, it has pulled over 2.4 million streams everyday this with, including an impressive 2.89 million streams on Monday (Aug. 26).

	Given how early it is in the song’s run, there’s no viral dance craze or can’t-miss trend set to its R&B-indebted groove just yet. Nonetheless, the song currently soundtracks over 16,000 clips on TikTok, a substantial portion of which finds fans gushing over how much they love the song. Notably, with 1.6 million views, “Good Graces” is also the Short n’ Sweet album track with the highest-viewed lyric video. 

	Between three consecutive smashes and a slew of choices for her next hit, Sabrina Carpenter certainly isn’t dealing with “Slim Pickins” when it comes to pushing Short n’ Sweet. – KYLE DENIS
