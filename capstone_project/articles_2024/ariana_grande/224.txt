Lady Gaga isn't playing games anymore—she's playing doctor. The pop icon's latest single, "Disease," released Thursday night, prescribes a potent dose of electro-pop that signals a return to her dance-floor roots, a sound many fans have long been waiting for. As reported by Variety, the track—co-written with her partner Michael Polansky and produced by industry heavy-hitters Andrew Watt and Cirkut—offers the first glimpse of her upcoming seventh studio album.In typical Gaga fashion, "Disease" weaves a provocative narrative through its infectious beats, bringing back echoes of The Fame days when Gaga first made her mark with dance-floor anthems. "I could play the doctor / I can cure your disease," she promises in the opening lines before the track builds to its fever pitch. The diagnosis gets steamier as she declares, "Lay you down like 1, 2, 3 / Eyes roll back in ecstasy," followed by the sultry assertion, "I can smell your sickness / I can cure ya / Cure your disease."The single marks a significant shift from Gaga's recent musical ventures. While her companion album to "Joker: Folie à Deux"—titled Harlequin—explored American Songbook standards like "Get Happy" and "That's Life," landing at No. 20 on the Billboard 200, this new release suggests a return to the electronic landscape where she first made her mark. For Gaga’s fans, this shift back to her electronic roots promises an exciting, long-awaited throwback.
Meanwhile, Gaga's star continues to rise on the charts with "Die With a Smile," her collaboration with Bruno Mars, maintaining one of the longest-running positions at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 singles chart this year. The upcoming album, slated for spring 2025, promises to channel a different emotional frequency than her previous work. In a recent Vogue interview, Gaga revealed, "I feel like this new album, in a lot of ways, is about that time but from a place of happiness instead of misery."For fans who’ve followed Gaga since her 2020 album Chromatica—which topped the Billboard 200 with hits like "Stupid Love" and the Ariana Grande collaboration "Rain on Me"—their patience seems set to pay off, especially with a spring 2025 release around the corner. The doctor, it seems, is definitely in. Listen to the new single, "Disease," below or by clicking here.
