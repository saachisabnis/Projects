Eminem inspired former President Barack Obama to drop a few bars from one of his classic hits while campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris. On Tuesday night, October 22, the Detroit rapper took the stage at Harris' campaign rally in Michigan to voice his support for the Democratic presidential nominee. He encouraged the citizens of his hometown to hit the polls ahead of November 5 and make their opinions heard without fear of retribution. After his brief speech, Eminem introduced the 44th POTUS to the stage. President Obama said he felt some type of way about following up Em's speech before he began to rap the opening verse of "Lose Yourself." 
"I thought Eminem was going to be performing," Obama said on stage. "I was gonna jump out. Love me some Eminem." Slim Shady's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris comes after the rapper spent years criticizing her opponent former President Donald Trump. Following Trump's victory in 2016, Eminem ripped him and his policies to shreds during a viral freestyle at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards. "Trump, when it comes to givin' a s**t, you're stingy as I am," he rapped during the award show's cypher. "Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em/'Cause you don't got the f**kin' nuts like an empty asylum/Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for/'Cause that's how he gets his f**kin' rocks off and he's orange." Eminem is one of several celebrities who have expressed their support for VP Harris in the months leading up to the election. Lizzo and Megan Thee Stallion have participated in her rallies while artists like Jermaine Dupri, Ariana Grande and more have issued statements that endorse Harris' campaign.
