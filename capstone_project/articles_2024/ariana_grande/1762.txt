The 2025 Grammys are around the corner, and there are sure to be so many exciting moments from music’s biggest night.
Keep reading for everything we know about the award show, so far:
The Grammys will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, live at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.
It’s unclear whose hosting music’s biggest night in 2025 as of yet. Last year’s host was comedian and The Daily Show‘s Trevor Noah.
The Grammys announced several changes to the upcoming award show, with several categories being renamed.
For example, the Best Remixed Recording Category has been moved from the Production, Engineering, Composition & Arrangement Field into the Pop & Dance/Electronic Field. The Category formerly known as Best Pop Dance Recording has been renamed Best Dance Pop Recording and the Best Dance/Electronic Music Album Category was renamed to Best Dance/Electronic Album.
