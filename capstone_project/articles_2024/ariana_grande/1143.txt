Drew Barrymore is the queen of surprises and had a little something up her sleeve for her latest talk show guest, Ariana Grande.  
In a clip promoting the highly-anticipated December 5th episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the iconic actress prepared Grande, who played Glinda in the latest adaptation of Wicked aside Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba, for some extremely exciting news. 
"I have something that's extremely exciting and special. It's actually...it was owned by the Smithsonian." 
As Grande grew more perplexed, Barrymore explained: 
"...and now it's owned in private hands but for the purposes of our sit-down, they loaned it to us." 
The "Side to Side" songstress let out a big gasp and questioned "are you serious?" before Barrymore had "the original Glinda wand" brought onto the stage. Grande, immediately brought to tears, grabbed the timeless prop in awe and jokingly walked away with it, pretending to leave the venue quipping, "thank you guys, it's been fun! Bye. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding!" 
She continued, wondering how the Blended actress even pulled something like this off. 
"Oh my gosh how did you even pull this off...did you break in?" 
Watch the shocking clip in its entirety below and check out the full episode on CBS this Thursday (December 5).
