The 82nd Golden Globes kick off the 2025 awards season next week! Hollywood’s Party of the Year will be hosted by Nikki Glaser (who is also nominated). This year, Viola Davis will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award and Ted Danson will be given the Carol Burnett Award. Emilia Pérez and The Bear are set to dominate the evening with the most nominations. Wicked, The Substance and Challengers will all be going head-to-head in the Best Musical or Comedy category, and Selena Gomez is crossing categories, nominated on both the film and TV side, for her work in Emilia Pérez and Only Murders in the Building, respectively.
Adam Brody, Ariana Grande, Dakota Fanning, Glen Powell, Kathryn Hahn, Pamela Anderson and Zoe Saldaña are all first-time nominees this year. The Golden Globe Awards are this Sunday, Jan 5, kicking off at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and streaming live on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME.
