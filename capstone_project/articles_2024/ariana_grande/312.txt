There are certain holiday traditions that have held up over time. Enjoying the marathon presentation of “A Christmas Story” and debating the merits of “Die Hard” as a Christmas movie are two that come to mind.
If you haven’t started binge watching the annual slew of Hallmark Christmas movies you better get busy before they’re gone.
Movies
“Wicked” released Nov. 21 is a Christmas present to the world. Based on the record-breaking Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman, “Wicked,” turns “The Wizard of Oz” on its head, in a good way. If you ever wanted to know how the Wicked Witch became “wicked” and learn “the other side of the story,” you can’t miss this movie. An exceptional cast lights up the screen with Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Yeoh.
Other holiday highlights:
“Moana 2” in theaters now is the sequel to “Moana,” a Disney animated children’s movie which was released in 2016 and stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as the demigod Maui. Moana and Maui head off in a new adventure in this film from Walt Disney Animation Studios joined by other returning characters from the first film.
“Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is releasing on Dec. 13. The film is a prequel, set 183 years before Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” film trilogy. It’s an anime adaptation of Tolkien’s world. The cast includes Brian Cox, Miranda Otto and Gaia Wise.
“Mufasa: The Lion King” releases Dec. 20. This is a live action sequel to the 2019 live action film “The Lion King,” based on the famed Disney animation original released in 1994. In this sequel, the legend of Mufasa is told in flashbacks to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, while Timon and Pumbaa offer up comedy relief. The cast includes Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and Blue Ivy Carter.
