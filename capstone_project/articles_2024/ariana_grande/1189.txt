I mean this is one of the reasons so many people are fans of Adam Sandler. He's not just a comedian and actor, he continually proves how big and beautiful his heart can be.
Leave it to Adam to take time on his Instagram to share a beautiful goodbye to a celebrity most of us probably don't know.
Have you heard of Alec Musser? He was born in New York City and raised in New Jersey and Connecticut before heading to sunny Southern California to pursue acting and modeling.
You may recognize the name if you're a fan of the soap opera All My Children. Alec was on it from 2005 to 2007 playing the character Del Henry after winning season two of the reality TV show I Wanna Be a Soap Star according to Deadline and Wikipedia.
Alec also appeared in an episode of Desperate Housewives in 2012 as a massage therapist. Besides brief acting stints, he modeled for Abercrombie and Fitch as well as appearing in GQ, Cosmopolitan, and Men's Health, as well as modeling for Speedo, and Target.
So how did Adam know who he was and take the time to post a tribute on his Instagram on Saturday night, January 12, 2024, the day he passed away?  Alec had a role as the 'hot guy at the water park' in the movie Grown Ups that Adam co-wrote, produced, and starred in along with Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph.
The comedy is about five friends who won their junior high school basketball championship in 1978 and are reunited 30 years over a 4th of July weekend because their basketball coach passed away.
The wives are totally fawning and drooling over this hunk which is definitely a scene stealer in the comedy Grown Ups.
Here's Adam's tribute.
I loved this guy. Cannot believe he is gone. Such a wonderful, funny good man. Thinking of Alec Musser and his family and sending all my love. A true great sweetheart of a person.
Alec was 50 years old.
