Ariana Grande has been “an incredible support system” for Normani.
The 28-year-old singer has heaped praise on Grande, 31, acknowledging that the award-winning star has helped her through some of the most difficult moments in her life. Grande has won two Grammy Awards and has accumulated over 90 billion streams globally. Her support for fellow artists has been widely recognized in the industry, making her one of the most respected mentors among young performers.
“Ari has been such an incredible support system for me.” Normani, who released her debut solo album, Dopamine, earlier this year, told E! News.
The album features collaborations with multiple award-winning producers and took over three years to complete. Industry insiders have praised the album’s innovative sound and complex production, noting its potential to reshape the current pop landscape.
Normani delayed the release of her debut album after both of her parents were diagnosed with cancer. However, Grande was a supportive presence throughout the difficult times. Normani has been open about using music as therapy during this challenging period. Her transparency about these personal struggles has resonated with fans worldwide, creating a stronger connection with her audience and inspiring others facing similar challenges.
“Even just when my album came out, whatever I have released she is always one of the first to text me and just let me know how proud she really is.” said the singer, who first found fame as a member of Fifth Harmony, the chart-topping girl group. Fifth Harmony achieved multiple platinum records and toured in over 40 countries. Their impact on modern girl groups continues to influence new artists emerging in the industry.
Normani explained that Grande has “always gone above and beyond” to support her in recent years. The two artists first connected professionally when Normani opened for Grande’s “Sweetener World Tour” in 2019. The tour was a massive success, grossing over $146 million worldwide and showcasing both artists’ exceptional performing abilities to global audiences.
“She also knows what I’ve endured,” Normani said. “This has not been an easy process for me, but she’s been there really every step of the way and has always gone above and beyond to make sure that I know how proud she is. It means a lot.”
Normani’s single “Motivation” reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been certified platinum. Music critics praised the song’s choreography-heavy music video, which paid homage to early 2000s R&B classics and demonstrated Normani’s versatility as a performer.
Similarly, Normani feels “proud” of Grande for her starring role in the new Wicked movie, observing that her showbiz pal is “pushing her limits and stepping into a completely different territory.” The highly anticipated Wicked adaptation has a reported budget of over $100 million and features groundbreaking special effects that are set to revolutionize movie musicals.
“I’m so proud of her,” Normani said. “Especially the fact that she’s just pushing her limits and stepping into a completely different territory. I honestly feel like she thrives in this space and I honestly can’t think of a better person to take on the role.”
Grande plays Glinda in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical, which has grossed over $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide. The role marks a significant milestone in Grande’s career, as she transitions from pop superstar to serious actress, following in the footsteps of other successful crossover artists.
