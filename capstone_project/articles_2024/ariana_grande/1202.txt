Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt reignited the Barbenheimer battle during Gosling’s “Saturday Night Live” monologue with an epic rendition of Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well,” complete with real-life Barbies and dancing Oppenheimers. 

UPDATE: Taylor Swift has enthusiastically approved “All Too Well (Ryan and Emily’s Version).” “Watch me accidentally catch myself singing this version on tour. This monologue is EVERYTHING,” the singer-songwriter posted on X.

All Too Well (Ryan and Emily’s Version) !!! Watch me accidentally catch myself singing this version on tour. This monologue is EVERYTHING 🫶🫶👏👏 https://t.co/yMo9dhbOFN

	Gosling kicked off his third “SNL” monologue with a callback to Ken, the role that nabbed him an Academy Award nomination and wild live performance at the Oscar ceremony. In a startling reveal, Gosling said he wasn’t going to make any jokes about Ken because they had to sever their relationship. “It’s not funny,” said Gosling. “Ken and I, we had to break up. We went too deep. And it’s over.”

	However, the actor revealed he wasn’t fully done processing the loss and that, “letting go feels like a breakup, and for processing a breakup, there’s really only one thing that can help: the music of the great Taylor Swift.” Cue the piano, shades and a new take on the Swift classic “All Too Well,” which is featured prominently in Gosling’s next film, “The Fall Guy.” 

	As Gosling continues going full-Ken, donning the iconic white fur coat and singing for the crowd until he’s quickly interrupted by his “Fall Guy” co-star Emily Blunt, upset that he has deviated from their “Fall Guy” monologue plan, who tells him he’s “embarrassing himself.” 

	The jabs kept coming as Gosling continued to expel his Kenergy until Blunt reappeared, this time smacking him in the head with a glass bottle and eventually a chair. Surprised, Gosling appeals to Blunt’s softer side by recalling her recent experience with “Oppenheimer,” which was also Oscar-nominated.  

	“I mean, I know it was an inferior movie,” Gosling said throwing shade at Blunt. “It wasn’t. We like won everything, actually,” Blunt retorted.  “But did you win people’s hearts? I don’t think so,” said Gosling.

	Blunt agreed, and they combined for a Barbenheimer send-off for both of their characters, backed by dancers and signs. 

	










	Gosling previously served as host in 2015 and 2017. His past notable sketches include the beloved “Papyrus,” “Santa Baby,” and “Close Encounter,” in which he broke acting against “Barbie” co-star Kate McKinnon several times. 

	Last week, Gosling made a special appearance during the opening monologue of Kristen Wiig, who was celebrating her induction into the coveted  “Five-Timers Club,” a group reserved for those who have hosted “SNL” five times. Gosling was joined by Martin Short, Will Forte, Fred Armisen, John Hamm, Matt Damon and Pual Rudd to help usher the former “SNL” cast member into the exclusive “Five-Timers” crew.

	Saturday night’s musical guest was 10-time Grammy-winning country star Chris Stapleton, who won best country song with his track “White Horse” at the 2024 Grammy Awards. He has been a musical guest on “SNL” two other times, in 2016 and 2018.
