Here's why you can't use your favorite musicals on TikToka anymore.
POPULAR
After the fallout between Universal Music Group and TikTok, several cast recordings have been taken off the platform.
While Universal Music Group's departure from the social media app meant that artists like Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande will no longer have their music featured in TikToks, the move has also affected several musicals.
Decca Broadway, a frequent contributor of Broadway cast recordings and movie musical soundtracks, is a subsidary of Universal Music Group. The fallout with TikTok has led to several iconic cast recordings being wiped from the app, with users no longer permitted to use the music in their videos.
The move has inspired several TikTok users to create their own covers of songs for use on the app. Since the original Broadway cast recording of Wicked has been banned, Kristin Chenoweth has released her own cover of "Popular" for future use.

Dead Outlaw is the darkly hilarious and wildly inventive musical about the bizarre true story of outlaw-turned-corpse-turned-celebrity Elmer McCurdy. As Elmer’s body finds even more outlandish adventures in death than it could have ever hoped for in life, the show explores fame, failure, and the meaning – or, utter meaninglessness – of legacy. Dying is no reason to stop living life to its fullest.
