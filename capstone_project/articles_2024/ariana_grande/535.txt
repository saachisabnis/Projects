We're holding space for these
After a whirlwind Wicked press tour—and holding space for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity”—it seems Ariana Grande found time to share even more behind-the-scenes clips from the Jon M. Chu film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. The singer took to Instagram on Friday to post a roundup of photos from her time on set, giving fans a peek inside the filming process of the highly anticipated movie. 
In the snaps, Grande shows off the intricate set design behind Shiz University, walking underneath the fictional school’s archways and courtyards. In one photo, she’s accompanied by co-star and friend Bowen Yang, while in another, she embraces Chu while filming in a classroom. 
Grande’s sweet bond with co-star Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, has become increasingly apparent throughout the Wicked press tour—and photos made it clear the two were also close on set. The friends could be seen posing in multiple snaps, each wearing their character's respective pink and green looks. 
Grande also shared several images of her and co-star Jonathan Bailey, showing the two giggling while filming, pouting for a photo, and embracing with fellow co-star (and Grande’s beau) Ethan Slater. She also can be seen getting her Glinda crown and costume fitted, taking a work break in baggy gray sweats, and practicing her choreography for “What Is This Feeling?” 
Earlier this week, the pop star posted another behind-the-scenes photo from set, sharing an image of her very first crown fitting in September of 2022. While Grande still had her dark locks back then, she wore a satin pink ensemble to embrace her character. “sept 2022, first crown fitting ♡ made of laser cut paper 🫧 i love you @paultazewell🩰🍡,” she captioned the photo, tagging Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell.
