Lorna Luft, the daughter of Judy Garland and Sidney Luft, watched an early screening of Wicked and could not wait to share her thoughts on the film.
Garland was an iconic American actress, singer, and dancer, best known for her portrayal of Dorothy Gale in the beloved 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Garland's career spanned decades, and she was celebrated for her incredible voice and acting talent – which was apparent in her performance in the iconic film.
Lorna, 71, posted a series of photos from the screening on her Instagram Thursday, November 14, and gave her review in the caption. "This movie is astounding! It's epic, brilliant, touching and honest," she wrote, adding, "It is breathtaking to look at ... the sets, costumes, makeup, performances, choreography, and the entire scope of the movie, is everything I wanted it to be."
Garland's daughter went on to praise Jon Chu, the director of the film, calling him a "genius" and revealed that she told him "that he had picked up the torch, the broom, and the wand, and carried it forward," and also thanked him for "adding to the family."
Lorna, who is half-sisters with Garland's other daughter, Liza Minelli, also applauded Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande –– who portray Elphaba Thropp and Galinda Upland, respectively. She wrote that the two are "nothing short of magnificent!" and added, "Their performances are honest, subtle, funny, and absolutely perfect." She also praised the rest of the cast, including Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, and more.
Lorna shared that she attended the talkback after the screening, where Chu and the cast discussed the making of the film. The Broadway performer described the movie as "a lot of fun" and felt it was "done with a great deal of love and respect for the original."

The caption ended with Luft encouraging fans to see the movie, writing, "Go see it and be taken on the journey of the witches! And buckle up, because it's one joy filled ride!"
