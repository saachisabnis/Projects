A performer’s wardrobe malfunction became the talk of the town after the grand opening of the 2024 Paris Olympics.
This year’s opening ceremony made history, as it was the first that was not held in the confines of a stadium. But amid performances by superstars like Lady Gaga and Celine Dion, a different kind of star stole the show on Friday, July 26.
Eagle-eyed viewers noticed an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction as the cameras panned across the dancers during one of the performances at the Olympics opener.

One keen observer pointed out the mishap on X with a photo that appeared to show a performer’s “scrotum” hanging out of their underwear for the world to see.
“And amongst the records broke by #Paris2024 #OpeningCeremony goes also the first scrotum ever showed at #Olympics,” read the tweet shared by Tancredi Palmeri.
Netizens commented on the eyebrow-raising sight, with one saying, “That’s nuts.”
“Surely not by accident,” one assumed, while another called it an “incredible catch.”
“That’s very … ballsy of him doing that lol,” another joked.

One wrote, “This is what the Olympics has devolved to? Disgusting!”
The dancer was seen in the background of a performance given by none other than French singer and actor Philippe Katerine. The now-55-year-old artist rose to fame in the 2000s with his hit Louxor j’adore.
Philippe’s act has become one of the most surreal moments of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony this year, as the singer was nearly nude while captured sprawling across a massive fruit platter.
The scantily clad performer, adorned with flowers and leaves, was the centerpiece of the show.

As viewers across the world watched on Friday, Philippe serenaded the crowd with a song called Nu, which means “Naked.”
“Where to hide a revolver when you’re completely naked?” he sang as he pointed toward his privates. “I know where you’re thinking. But that’s not a good idea.”
“No more rich and poor when you go back to being naked. Yes,” he continued.
Following the performance, he explained that his get-up included being coated with “gallons” of blue paint to represent Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and fertility.
“I’m a bit of an exhibitionist,” the French entertainer said, as quoted by NBC News.
A post shared by The Olympic Games (@olympics)
Despite the controversy sparked by his semi-nude act, he said he was “proud” of it and wanted to respect the original Olympic Games in Greece with his performance.
“Nudity is really the very origin of the Games. At first, they were naturist Olympics,” he said.
He also had a message to share with his song Nu, which was: “If you’re naked, there’s no war because there are no weapons.”

Why are (some) people so obsessed with genitals? We all have them. Get over it.
Why dont they show female genitals ever and only males?
Would you just “get over it” if your child were near his nut sack?
Bored Panda - Protecting viewer's eyes from words like "k**b" but featuring an article about a man's ball sack. Thanks for the morning coffee laugh BP.
What the actual hell, BoredPanda. You’re so focused on someone’s genitals and can’t even report on the incredible athletic feat’s of these amazing athletes. What the hell has happened to this site!? It’s embarrassing. 😳
I don’t know, I’m not really into feet. I think there are websites that cater for that sort of thing though! 😆👣
Hah hah, cursed typos!
This is an article about Katerine and the dancers. If you wanna read about the athletes, WTF are you doing here? There’re entire sites dedicated to the Olympics. Going to a site dedicated to something else and then whining that it’s not covering the athletes is just plain boneheaded. It’s like going to Sports Illustrated’s site and moaning about how there’re no articles about cats.
What if they were female genitals? It would be world news and cries of sexism and misogyny, make them male, and every feminist and gay supports it.
*feats
Nobody likes a grammar jerk. Gasp, I’m allowed to make a f*****g typo on a website that promotes photos of fuzzy kittens. 🙄
