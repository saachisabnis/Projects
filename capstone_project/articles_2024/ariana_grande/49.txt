Ozian witches past and present gathered to celebrate the release of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.
It's good to see them, isn't it? Past and present actors of Wicked on Broadway were invited to a special screening of the film adaptation October 28. Attendees included original stage Glinda Kristin Chenoweth, the show's composer Stephen Schwartz, former stage Glinda Brittney Johnson, current stage Elphaba Mary Kate Morrissey, and more—as well as the film's stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, and the film's director Jon M. Chu. The first part of the two-part Wicked film will be released November 22.
In post-screening remarks, Chenoweth shared her in-the-moment reactions with the film's stars and its director, saying "I'm so happy that I am alive when they made this movie and that's it. Jon Chu. I can't imagine a more perfect director than you for this. And Cynthia, your heart and soul is everything. Ariana, since you were 10, I knew this was what you want to do. I'm so glad it happened this way. I'm glad I'm alive to see it. I'm proud of both of you."
Said Grande, "And we're just really, really grateful to have been chosen to be a part of it." Then, turning to Chenoweth, she said, "This is a love letter to you, to Idina, to every Glinda and Elphaba in this room. We love you all so much. This is a love letter to Wicked and to Oz." She then exclaimed. "I'm out of body."
The sentiment was echoed by Erivo, who said, "I'm having the most out-of-body experience I could possibly have to be standing in front of my theatre family." She then said the film was dedicated to everyone who's ever been in Wicked on stage, saying, "You made so many people happy and we really, really hope that we can make you happy too."
Original stage Elphaba Idina Menzel could not attend, but she did send in a video that was played during the post-screening Q&A session: "I wish I could be there, I swear, to celebrate this beautiful beautiful movie—which I've already seen, so I can say that." 
But that wasn't all. After, Chenoweth recorded her reaction to the film in a video posted to Instagram, sharing: "Oh my gosh I just saw the movie and I'm dying. I'm deceased, I'm actually dead, I'm not here. People are not going to be well when they see this film. It is so good, it is so special. The story is so wonderful, and Cynthia and Ariana are amazing. The whole cast is amazing. Jon Chu nailed it. I was so moved, emotional, happy, filled with joy. Please everybody go see Wicked, you'll be blessed." You heard it from the Good Witch, herself.

Wicked, injecting a new backstory onto the classic tale The Wizard of Oz, debuted on Broadway in 2003 and continues to be an audience favorite at the Gershwin Theatre. Based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, the musical features music and lyrics by Schwartz and a book by Holzman. The musical is now the fourth longest-running production in Broadway history.
The show won 2004 Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Musical (Idina Menzel), Best Costume Design (Susan Hilferty), and Best Scenic Design (Eugene Lee).
