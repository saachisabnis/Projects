So the most comedy musical nominated ever is only getting songâ€¦ IDK
Emilia Perez is mostly likely going to underperform during ceremony night.

I think it will get only Zoe and even then Arianaâ€™s breathing into her neck lol.
Song will be Kiss the Sky.
Stream MAYHEM, give Sarah Snook her Tony, Colin Farrell his Emmy and make Severance, The Studio + The Pitt sweep all awards!
The 3x Emmy Winner for Best Drama Series, Succession!
Emilia Perez is mostly likely going to underperform during ceremony night.
Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s winning everything. But I wouldnt Underestimate it winning for SaldaÃ±a or Comedy Musical

Song will be Kiss the Sky.
Itâ€™s definitley between her and Ariana but if Ariana wins I think itâ€™s taking Comedy or Musical. They are gonna wanna give it a big award!
I think we might have 2-4 upsets in 2025 Golden Globe winners:
Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) â€“ Wicked (especially the singalong movie version will come during the Golden Globe final round voting which starts December 13 until New Yearâ€™s Day)
Non-English Language Motion Picture â€“ All We Imagine as Light
Best Supporting Actress â€“ Ariana Grande (I donâ€™t see a EmilÃ­a Perez buzz anywhere which is why EmilÃ­a Perez movie has been flopping in regional critics circle awards in the US so far)
Cinematic and Box Office Achievement â€“ Inside Out 2

Emilia had the Globe noms because the film collapsed so far with critics groups in USA. Also, the Guilds start today and till Friday, we will see where is the industry support actually.

EmilÃ­a Perez is this yearâ€™s Barbie as usual.

Darling, I donâ€™t even like Trashyfier 3 that much, but it really shouldâ€™ve gotten in that box office whatever category. Being an unrated gorefest no budget indie and ended up grossing almost $90 million is the real box office achievement of the year than any of those surefire moneymaking blockbusters. 
Completely agreed. Plus, a nom for Song. Terrifier 3, should have gotten 2 Globe nominationsâ€¦ and a lot of Razzie ones, as well.
The way I rly thought Unstoppable would be a thing and predicted both Jerome & JLo ðŸ¤¡. It could still surprise at SAG but I feel like itâ€™s no1curr after all.
Ngng. Iâ€™ve got a few of those myself.

I predicted both too but it seems thereâ€™s no buzz for that movie unfortunately

Would it have any effect tho? Wicked was released just in time for GG voting with tons of promo, great reviews and still couldnâ€™t get more nods than what everyone was already predicting.
IMO Anora is pretty safe for Picture.

2-time Oscar winner, EMMA STONE
Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK
Oscar & Emmy nominee, SEBASTIAN STAN
