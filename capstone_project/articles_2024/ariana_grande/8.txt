After several weeks of competing and passionate performances, Mississippi-native Deon Jones' journey ended Monday night on Season 26 of NBC's "The Voice."
During Monday night's knockout rounds, Jones, a Wiggins native, competed against fellow contestants Jose Luis and Camryn Brooks. All three contestants were on judge Gwen Stefani's team and were hoping to advance to next week's competition.
Jones gave an impressive performance of Ike and Tina Turner's "Nutbush City Limits," prompting the judges to sing along and dance in their chairs.
But, ultimately, Jones' soulful performance couldn't beat Brooks' emotional rendition of Pink's "Glitter in the Air." Brooks also won out over Luis' performance of Ariana Grande's "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)."
Jones originally began the season on country singer Reba McEntire's team after he wowed her during the blind auditions with a heartfelt performance of Donny Hathaway's "Little Ghetto Boy." McEntire was the only judge to turn her chair.

Then, during the battle rounds, Jones lost to fellow Team Reba contestant Danny Joseph. After the battle, the judges had the chance to steal the losing contestant, and Stefani quickly seized the opportunity.
"I had to steal Deon," Stefani said at the time. "I couldn't let him go home. He's not only just a good singer, he's a great performer."
Ultimately, Jones' chapter on "The Voice" closed Monday night, and the singer was sent home."
