We are a world obsessed with lymphatic drainage right now – Google searches have gone up by 60 per cent in the last month, while on TikTok there are over 79 million views on the term. Lymphatic drainage massage (and other techniques, such as dry body brushing), can help to reduce water retention, puffiness and inflammation by flushing out toxins and excess liquids. Celebrities love it, but is it accessible to the rest of us?

Yes, if Rebecca Faria (also known as @DetoxbyRebecca on Instagram) has anything to do with it. Based in Beverly Hills, she specialises in Brazilian lymphatic drainage (a rhythmic massage, which combines pressure and long strokes), and has a roster of A-list clients who swear by her techniques (including Jennifer Aniston, Hailey Bieber, Ariana Grande and Anne Hathaway). While a treatment with one of Faria’s team starts from $350 (£276), she’s shared some of her favourite (easy) exercises that are designed to stimulate your lymphatic system at home. And they’re free.
Hug one knee into your chest. Hold for 20 seconds, then do the other side.
Lie on your back and place the soles of your feet together, letting your knees fall out in a butterfly formation.
While lying down, hold your legs straight up, then lift one as you lower the other. These are called flutter kicks – do 20 of them. (Incidentally, these are also great for your core.)
Remain lying down. With one leg on the floor, lift the other leg and move in a circular motion 20 times. Repeat on the other leg.
With your legs in a table-top position, straighten one leg, then the other, 20 times.
Lying on your left-hand side and keeping the legs relatively straight, circle your right leg 20 times. Do the same on the other leg.
Stand with your feet flat on the floor, then raise up onto your toes, lifting your heels off the ground. Do this 20 times.
