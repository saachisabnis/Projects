Ariana Grande is detailing her experience handling the public reaction to her relationship with Wicked co-star Ethan Slater following her split from ex-husband Dalton Gomez. 
In a interview with Vanity Fair published Monday (September 30), Grande explained how the response to her and Slater's romance was "disappointing" to watch unfold as many of the stories and much of the speculation couldn't have been further from the truth, per TODAY. The pair first sparked romance rumors in July 2023, shortly after her separation from Gomez, her husband of two years, and amid filming of the upcoming film adaptation of the beloved musical. A source at the time also confirmed to TODAY that Slater was also separated from his now-ex wife Lilly Jay, with whom he shares a son.
"The most disappointing part was to see so many people believe the worst version of it," she said. "There couldn't be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him..."
The "We Can't Be Friends" singer added of her Broadway star beau, "No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about. There is no one on this earth with a better heart, and that is something that no bulls--- tabloid can rewrite in real life."
While Grande and Slater have kept details of their relationship private, they have been seen enjoying spending time together. Earlier this year, they were photographed on a "rare" date night in public when they attended a hockey game, chatting with other fans otherwise having a fun, sporty night out.
