Cynthia Erivo has explained her heated response to a fan edited version of the Wicked poster during a new interview. The Oscar-nominated actress will star as Elphaba in the upcoming film adaptation of the Broadway classic.

	“It wasn’t necessarily a clapback,” Erivo told Entertainment Tonight. She was referring to posts she made on her Instagram stories in early October, where she took offense to fans making edits of the Wicked film poster to look more like the classic Broadway one. The edits covered Erivo’s eyes and altered her smile, which the star called “deeply hurtful” at the time.

	“I’m really protective of the role,” she told ET. “I am passionate about it, and I know that the fans are passionate about it, and I think, for me, it was just like a human moment of wanting to protect little Elphaba. It was a human moment.”
