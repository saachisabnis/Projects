During his new Netflix special, Turbo Fonzarelli, Pete Davidson told the audience that he was high on ketamine when he attended Aretha Franklin’s funeral with his ex-fiancée, Ariana Grande, in 2018.
“I’m embarrassed I was out and about like that. That’s not cool,” the Saturday Night Live alum said. He then shared the cringeworthy thing he said to Franklin’s family.
“I was so high I thought it’d be a good idea to go up to her family and go, ‘Hey! I’m just here to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts,’” Davidson said. He added that if the “Think” singer were there, she’d say to him: “’Hey! Who are you and what the f–k are you doing at my funeral?’”
