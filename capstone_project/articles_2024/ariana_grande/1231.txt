Lizzo has a message of positivity for followers following Donald Trump’s election win this week. 

	Two days after Election Day ended with the twice-impeached former POTUS securing his second term in the White House, the 36-year-old musician shared a video on Instagram captioned with a simple rainbow emoji Thursday (Nov. 7). In the clip, only Lizzo’s hands are visible as she writes on a sheet of printer paper: “Sending LOVE to everyone in the WORLD.” 

	The Grammy winner paired the video with Beautiful Chorus’ ethereal “Faith Hymn.”

	The post marks Lizzo’s first since the election concluded, resulting in Kamala Harris – whom the “About Damn Time” artist had championed throughout the 2024 race – after a whirlwind three-month campaign taking over the Democratic ticket for President Joe Biden. Before the results came in Tuesday (Nov. 5), Lizzo posted a photo of herself meeting the VP and wrote, “Today’s the day! Let’s win this💙❤️🤍” 

	










	In July, right after Harris’ campaign kicked off, Lizzo defended the former prosecutor against critics who accused the politician of not doing anything during her term as vice presidency. “For everyone saying that Kamala Harris didn’t do anything when she was VP, please, for $5,000, do not use Google, tell me what any vice president has ever done during their term that was notable that you noticed,” she said in an Instagram video at the time. “Can we all just be for real? Let’s all be for real and say our quiet parts out loud, because the discourse is tired.”  

	Lizzo is just the latest musician who’s posted since Trump won the election. Many of the musicians who also endorsed Harris this election – Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Cardi B and more – have also spoken out over the past 36 hours, while Jack Antonoff recently tweeted to his followers, “do not be cynical. do not have the conversation alone in your head. go be together. be around those who do not assume the worst of you.”
