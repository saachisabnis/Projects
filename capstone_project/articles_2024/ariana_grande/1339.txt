Mattel has apologized for unintentionally posting a link to an adult website on some “Wicked” doll packages. The toy company said they will take action to remove the misprinted toys’ packaging. “We deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this,” a Mattel statement reads. It’s unclear how many toys were affected, but Mattel says the misprinted boxes were primarily sold in the United States. The link on the boxes unfortunately sent users to a website which bears the same name as the upcoming “Wicked” movie. The film, which stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, is set to hit theaters on November 22nd. (UPI)
