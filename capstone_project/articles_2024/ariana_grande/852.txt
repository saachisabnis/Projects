Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions (Part 2)
Any predictions for rap? I have a feeling the front runners in terms of noms is Carnival, Agora Hills, First Person Shooter, Rich Baby Daddy, and Lovin on Me
Also because I still have hope for her, my Nicki submission predictions (IF she submits) 
Let Me Calm Down – Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, Best Melodic Rap 
Everybody – Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, ROTY, SOTY (the last 2 will probably not happen) 
FTCU – Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance
Blessings – Best Gospel whatever she’s eligible for. I’m not savy with gospel categories.
Pink Friday Girls – Best Pop Solo Performance 
Pink Friday 2 – Best Rap Album, AOTY (yes I know AOTY is 99% not happening) 
Also I doubt she’ll or her label will submit this but
Needle – Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song 
Also given Nicki’s not so great track record these past 2 years, I feel like the Grammys will do something dumb and have her compete in Best Pop Vocal Album for PF2 IF she submits. I doubt it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they did.
Everybody should be submitted to Best Pop Dance Recording. It’s basically a remix of iconic dance hits with 4 new verses. If Super Freaky Girl was moved from Rap then Everybody shouldn’t be accepted there neither.
Nicki just released the extended version of LMCD A.K.A. the best song from Pink Friday 2. I still don’t like her but if I were her I would take full advantage of this collaboration, send it to all the radios and put a good music video to it. Having J. Cole on her side is an opportunity not to be missed.
It's me... Hi
Pop Dance Recording? What would be her chances if she submitted there? I do see it tho since it samples Move Your Feet.
I feel like LMCD is her best choice for any type of nom at least, but if Drake submits FPS, I don’t know if they’ll choose her collab over his. They can probably put LMCD in melodic and FPS in performance right?
Ariana Grande should submit for the 67th Grammys:
eternal sunshine – AOTY, BPVA and Engineered Non Classical
We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) – ROTY, SOTY, Pop Solo, and Music Video
Yes, And? – Pop Dance Recording

Taylor swift will get a ton of grammys. I feel like TTPD will be her tapestry.
Nicki should def submit :
FTCU – Rap Performance
Fallin 4 U – Rap Song
Let Me Calm Down – Melodic Rap Performance
Everybody – Pop Duo Group, ROTY, SOTY
Pink Friday Girls – Pop Solo
Pink Friday 2 – AOTY, Rap Album.
I can see her maybe getting 3 nods at most. Which would be great for her.
i see nicki getting zero nods maximum
I don’t see anyone predicting Billy Joel’s first single in almost two decades, “Turn the Lights Back On”. As of right now, I could maybe see it happening in Record of the Year.
i just need to warn you guys that i’m about 3 delusional nicki minaj prediction posts away from becoming gucci 💕
At least we all agree that “yes, and?” won’t happen in the GF. I used to be big on Ariana, sweetener is one of my favorite albums ever and the art direction was stunning. I was hoping to be positively surprised (still am) with this new era because positions is my least liked album from her (including the not so great My Everything) but if the album is on par with the lead… welll… let’s go back to playing “get well soon”.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
Listen, I haven’t heard the album either, but Ariana compared “yes, and?” as a first-single choice to “thank u, next” based on the narrative, despite “seven rings” being the bigger hit (and her ROTY submission). We’ll have to see if she has another hit in store. The stans that heard the album seem to be very pleased. 
Soon we’ll know!
This is probably gonna be a hot take but I think Beyonce should put the reclaiming the black origin of the genre’s aside for a bit and get a collab with Taylor in ACT II. Should probably give the album a second hit, which would strengthen it’s chances in AOTY and the country field might be more open to Bey if Tay is in.
Beyonce should reopen the Fearless vault and get a song with a similar vibe to “You All Over Me”. It’s gonna be beneficiary for both parties.
