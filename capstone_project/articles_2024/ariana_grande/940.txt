STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Good news, “Saturday Night Live” fans!
After a brief break, the show returns with a new episode tonight.
Irish actor Paul Mescal will take the stage as a first-time host with musical guest Shaboozey.
Mescal was first introduced to American audiences as Connell in the television series “Normal People,” and recently played the lead role in Ridley Scott’s latest and long-awaited film “Gladiator II.”
Shaboozey is also set to make his first “SNL” appearance. His song, “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” recently marked its 19th week at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100, matching a record set by Lil Naz X’s “Old Town Road” for most weeks at No. 1.

“SNL” fans will be excited to know that former Staten Islander Colin Jost, the longest-serving “Weekend Update” anchor in the show’s history, is still at the desk.
Joining Jost for Season 50 is his longtime “Weekend Update” co-anchor, Michael Che, along with Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang.
Featured players Marcello Hernández, James Austin Johnson, Michael Longfellow, Sarah Sherman and Devon Walker have also returned. “SNL” also welcomed three new cast members for Season 50: Ashley Padilla, Emil Wakim and Jane Wickline.
In late summer, Punkie Johnson, Molly Kearney and Chloe Troast announced on social media that they were not asked back. Johnson had been a cast member for four seasons, Kearney had been a featured player for two years, and Troast had just wrapped up her first year.
