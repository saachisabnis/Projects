Of all major console game publishers, Square Enix has been one of the more supportive of the mobile platform – releasing a ton of ports as well as dedicated mobile titles. One of its most successful has been Final Fantasy Brave Exvius; and so it comes as a surprise that the game is shutting down its services this October.
Making the announcement on Facebook, the team at Square Enix revealed the unfortunate news, saying:
“Thank you for playing FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS. We regret to announce we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS app service as of October 30, 2024 23:59 (PDT). From the FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS Development Team, we apologize for the difficult decision, but are sincerely grateful for the support we've received from our players.”

In a rather harsh move, following the ending of service “all player accounts will be deleted” – marking the end of what is nearly a decade long journey for some players.
For the uninitiated, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius first launched worldwide in June of 2016, and since then has been updated and added to countless times, including a ton of interesting and unique crossovers – just some of which included: NieR: Automata; Deus Ex: Mankind Divided; Just Cause 3; Xenogears; Fullmetal Alchemist and even Ariana Grande.
It is worth noting that the game will remain active and playable in Japan, but for the rest of the world, one of Square Enix’s longest-running mobile games is coming to a definitive end.

For a while, it seemed as though both digital and physical mediums could co-exist in the games industry. Unfortunately, through the evolution of technology, the de-evolution of the industry and what seems to be a concerted effort to make the overall experience worse, physical media is now in many ways objectively inferior to digital.
