He came in like a wrecking ball.
Keith Urban paid Miley Cyrus a bizarre “compliment” in a new interview.
“I love Miley. I’ve always loved Miley,” the country singer, 56, said on the “Fitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie” podcast Wednesday.
“I love that voice, man, that voice. She sounds like an ashtray — and I mean that as a compliment,” he continued. “I literally mean that as a compliment.”
Urban’s admiration for Cyrus, 31, is no secret, as he has covered her hit song “Flowers” numerous times on the road over the past year.
The former “American Idol” judge has also performed live renditions of Taylor Swift’s “Anti-Hero” and Ariana Grande’s “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” in recent months.
“I mean, God, Taylor’s songwriting, it’s so extraordinary. There’s really no adjectives for it,” he raved to People in May.
“She’s such a great, great writer. So this new album [‘The Tortured Poets Department’] is just more proof of that in really great ways.”
As for Grande, Urban told the magazine, “She doesn’t sound like anyone. It’s like Taylor. I like singers that you know their voice immediately, and there’s a lot of other singers that sound like them, but they don’t sound like anyone.
“Ariana has always had that unique vocal gift,” he enthused. “On top of that, she’s a phenomenal writer and producer.”
The “One Too Many” crooner even went so far as to compare “We Can’t Be Friends” to “audible heroin,” saying he “cannot stop playing it” around the house.
“That’s my absolute current obsession song right now,” he shared.
