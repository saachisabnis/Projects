Music is an omnipresent aspect of human culture. Every country has its own traditional, national, and popular music. In much a similar fashion, every country has its own long-standing gambling industry. Both of these forms of entertainment have been around for as long as humans have existed; which begs the question: are they related somehow? Let’s find out.
Online casinos are the hot button issue among gamblers. Some view them as a fad that will soon pass. But most see them as the future of gambling. Indeed, we are more likely to side with the latter, as the online gambling industry has been around for a couple of decades, and, as the popularity of this website proves, is already capable of competing with the land-based casino industry.
But, how do online casinos incorporate music? Well, music actually plays a huge role in iGaming. The games that benefit most from musical accompaniment are online slots. Game developers create music that they know will fit the theme of online slots. The music used is usually upbeat and friendly, in order to entice the players to continue playing.
Land-based casinos have used music to attract customers for a long time. In the past, gambling was widely associated with men. Viewed as a manly activity, the music reflected the taste of men. Lounge music to calm your nerves, or upbeat jazz was the casino standard. However, recently, studies have shown that women are much more likely to visit casinos. So, how has that changed music?
Well, most casinos today are much more likely to play popular music, made by female creators. It seems women are much more likely to relate to what other women create, so don’t be surprised if you visit a land-based casino and hear musicians like Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, etc. These have become staples of gambling establishments.
Finally, musicians have been inspired by gambling for as long as music has been around. Popular songs exist from all genres that discuss the life of a gambler, or the thrills associated with playing casino games. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular songs that are obviously about gambling.
Motorhead is one of the most iconic metal/rock bands. They gained prominence in 1980, when their fourth studio album, Ace of Spades dropped. The title track, as you might expect, is an absolute ode to gambling by the legendary rock band, and talks about games like roulette, craps, poker, and blackjack. The song remains a heavy metal anthem to this day, and is most people’s first introduction to Motorhead.
The Gambler is an iconic country/rock song, that has been covered by a variety of artists, including the legendary Johnny Cash. However, the most iconic rendition of the song is Kenny Rodgers’. Accompanied by an incredibly popular music video, the song tells the story of an old gambler, who shares his life with a young man, before he passes away.
Lady Gaga’s Poker Face has become a modern classic. The pop tune is not about gambling per se. However, it does reference gambling imagery in order to tell a passionate, erotic love story.
