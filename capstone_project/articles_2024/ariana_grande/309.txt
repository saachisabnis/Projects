The movie theatre industry has had its ups and downs in the past few years in Colorado. The streaming wars have certainly been a game changer and movie theatres have been trying to find solutions to compete in this new era. I am a big fan of going to the movies. I believe the movie theatre experience is a ton of fun and I, too am guilty of not going as often as I should be.
A message has been played at AMC theaters in Colorado. While it brought joy to many, it also left some customers dissatisfied.
We all want to have a good time when we pay to go watch our favorite movies at the movie theater. However, having a good time varies based on the experience that you want to have.
The highly anticipated “Wicked”, movie has been released. The film, which stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, is by far one of the biggest movies released of the year. The film is an adaptation of the musical of the same name. The film screening at AMC theatres across the country discourages audiences from singing along during the viewing.
Yahoo says this is the message shown before the movie begins.
At AMC Theatres, silence is golden. No talking. No texting. No singing. No wailing. No flirting. And absolutely no name-calling. Enjoy the magic of movies.
Audiences in Colorado interpreted the sign as a direct message to not sing during the movie. They believe the stars should be doing the singing.
There are ten AMC theatres in Colorado. This message has reportedly been made at all “Wicked” screenings.
I might sound grumpy when I say this, but I am glad that this message was shown. I am sure there will be sing-a-long versions in the future. People pay money to watch the movie and the actors perform. Most people probably do not want to hear a stranger scream off-tune over their shoulder during the entire movie.
I feel the same way about, what I call scream-singing, at concerts.
