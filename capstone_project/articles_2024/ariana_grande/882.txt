Sir Elton John might have sang that “Saturday night’s alright for fighting,” but Saturday nights are better used for another pastime: tuning in to Saturday Night Live.
The hit NBC sketch comedy show is in the midst of its 49th season, and per usual, has boasted a star-studded lineup of guest hosts and musical guests. SNL alum Pete Davidson returned to his old stomping grounds to kick off the latest season last October.
Since the Season 49 premiere — which even featured a surprise appearance from Taylor Swift — the slew of celeb hosts have included Bad Bunny (who also took on the role of musical guest), Emma Stone, Dakota Johnson, Ayo Edebiri and the controversial comic Shane Gillis.
Meanwhile, among the musical guests that have taken over the Studio 8H stage this season are Ice Spice, Noah Kahan, Justin Timberlake, Reneé Rapp, Jennifer Lopez and 21 Savage.
Tonight, Anyone But You star Sydney Sweeney is at the helm for the first time alongside musical guest Kacey Musgraves. Meanwhile, Josh Brolin returns to host SNL for the third time with musical guest and Wicked star Ariana Grande next week (March 9).
Keep reading to find out out how to watch SNL tonight.
SNL airs tonight at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT.
SNL is broadcast live on NBC and will also stream live on Peacock. Next-day streaming and all previous seasons of SNL are available on Peacock, as well. Peacock plans start at $5.99/month or $59.99/year.
