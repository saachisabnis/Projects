On Tuesday, the band gave their Brisbane, Australia, audience a real-life Bluey collaboration. The second half of their show began with an homage to the show’s theme song — where the names of Bluey’s family members were replaced with Joe, Nick and Kevin. “The collab you never knew you needed,” Jonas Brothers captioned the video on Instagram.
