Many people start their day with coffee (or another caffeinated beverage) and celebrities are no exception.
Ree Drummond exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2020 that she forgoes popular coffee chains in favor of brewing her own java. “I make it myself,” she dished, noting that cold brew is her pick-me-up of choice. “Most of the glass is filled with ice, cold brew concentrate, a splash of half-and-half and sometimes sweetener.”
When it comes to sweeteners, Drummond said that sometimes she uses raw sugar, but other times she adds flavor to her coffee using sweetened condensed milk. “But that’s not an everyday thing,” she told Us with a chuckle.

Given Ariana Grande’s last name — which is the same word Starbucks uses to describe its large beverages — it’s no surprise that she has a penchant for the coffee giant. However, as Grande explained to Time in August 2014, she doesn’t limit herself solely to grande drinks. “Sometimes I get that venti, you know? Some days that’s what you need in your life,” she said. “I love soy lattes. Obviously I don’t have dairy because I’m a vegan, but they taste out of this world to me.”

Though the former America’s Next Top Model host prefers her coffee without “those syrups and those powders” she still enjoys a flavorful cup of java. As the California native explained to Harper’s Bazaar in April 2020, she prepares her version of the caffeinated beverage using beans that have been “soaked in some vanilla or some caramel infusation [sic]” but skips the sugar and cream.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star’s coffee order was revealed via her costar Kyle Richards’ Instagram Stories in October 2019, as the American Woman creator shared a video clip of the RHOBH ladies placing their caffeinated beverage requests at a Los Angeles Starbucks. For the record, Rinna asked for a grande “dirty chai with soy milk.” (FYI, a dirty chai latte means that the drink has a shot of espresso in it.)

The Vampire Diaries alum forgoes the big coffee chains in favor of making his own caffeinated concoction — tea, which he whips in a NutriBullet along with coconut oil, cacao and a pinch of salt. “You’re getting the electrolytes, you’re getting the caffeine and you’re getting the fat with the cacao,” he explained to Harper’s Bazaar in November 2019. The Lost alum is also a fan of the coffee and coconut oil combo. “If you whip it [together,] you’re binding caffeine molecules to a fat lipid, so your body burns it slower and more evenly.”
