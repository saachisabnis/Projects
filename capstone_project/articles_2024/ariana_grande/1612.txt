Billie Eilish returned to Saturday Night Live yesterday to perform a pair of Hit Me Hard and Soft tracks. Watch her do “Birds of a Feather,” surrounded by a screen setup of bright blue skies, and a somber “Wildflower” below.
Previous guests for Saturday Night Live’s 50th season include Jelly Roll and Stevie Nicks, the latter in an episode hosted by Ariana Grande. Michael Keaton hosted last night’s episode, promoting Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. He was joined by Andy Samberg in the opening monologue.
Eilish’s last Saturday Night Live appearance was in December, when she did “What Was I Made For?” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”
