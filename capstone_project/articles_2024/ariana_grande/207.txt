Patrick Milling-Smith, co-founder and CEO of SMUGGLER, and James Razzall, U.S. president, integrated advertising, of Framestore, have been named chairpersons of the 2025 AICP Show: The Art & Technique of the Commercial, and the 2025 AICP Post Awards, respectively.
“I feel honored and excited,” noted Milling-Smith, of being asked to chair the AICP Show. “I’m touched by the generosity of previous chairs, who nominated me and immediately reached out to offer any help and perspective. My goal is just to be a worthy custodian and champion of the 34th year of the show. We plan to do our industry proud as we continue to remind our peers of this competition’s unique place in the advertising, creative, and production landscape.”
“For me, it’s a huge honor,” echoed Razzall. “I am very excited, if a tiny bit daunted by the task at hand. What makes it more gratifying is that, in the fall of 2025, I’ll have been part of Framestore for 25 years, so it’s a nice landmark to be recognized by my peers.”
Razzall said being the first executive or artist from the visual effects sector reflects the discipline’s impact on the overall advertising content creation process. “It’s a testament to the way the visual effects industry has grown and matured over the years,” he adds. “I think it’s great that we’re now being viewed as such an integral part of the creative production process.”
“SMUGGLER has consistently been at the forefront of our industry, producing creative, engaging and effective content for brands,” said Matt Miller, AICP president and CEO. “The AICP Show Board of Governors tasked Patrick with Chairing the 2025 installment of the AICP Show because of his longstanding commitment to excellence in craft, creativity, and innovation – all hallmarks of the AICP Show.”
“Similarly, James is an outstanding leader in visual effects, and his selection reflects the scope of the AICP Post Awards,” Miller noted. “Framestore has set so many standards in creative and executional excellence under his leadership, while pushing the needle forward in terms of visual effects achievements, so having someone with his insight and experience as the Post Awards Chairperson is a true privilege.”
Commenting on the role that the AICP Show plays in the constellation of industry honors and recognition, Milling-Smith believes the competition is truly unique: “The Museum of Modern Art archiving partnership gives the show an added gravitas and sense of purpose, as does the standard of the judging and the curatorial structure,” he observed. “There is a real clarity and integrity to the AICP showcase and the nominated work traditionally has a sense of durability to it, with a distinct appreciation of craft. There is nothing disposable about the AICP.”
“On the whole, the AICP Show is a recognition of the work and the people behind that work,” Milling-Smith continued. “The entire judging process represents an opportunity for many to come together, evaluate the state of the industry and be inspired by what’s possible. And then, of course, the black-tie ad-prom gala at the MoMA in New York City. Always a beautiful moment to take a breath and appreciate, perhaps even celebrate.”
Added Razzall, “One of the many things I love about the AICP Post Awards is that it’s totally dialed in when it comes to its categories; it’s very well broken-out from a post perspective. And now that the presentation of winners during the MoMA gala has been combined with those of the AICP Show, it really shines a spotlight on the fact that the post community is such an integral part of the overall commercial making process.”

One of Harvey Weinstein 's accusers broke down in tears and cursed on the witness stand Friday as a defense lawyer questioned her account of the former Hollywood mogul forcing oral sex on her nearly two decades ago.
"He was the one who raped me, not the other way around," Miriam Haley told jurors.
"That is for the jury to decide," Weinstein lawyer Jennifer Bonjean responded.
"No, it's not for the jury to decide. It's my experience. And he did that to me," Haley said, using expletives as tears began streaming down her face.
Judge Curtis Farber halted questioning and sent jurors on a break. Haley, her eyes red and face glistening, did not look at Weinstein as she left the witness stand.
Haley, 48, was testifying for a fourth day at Weinstein's rape trial. Questioning resumed after the break, with Haley composed but occasional flickers of frustration in her voice.
By midafternoon, the judge grew impatient with contentious cross-talk and extraneous comments from Haley and the attorney. Farber pounded his fist on the bench at one point and banged his gavel at another, telling them: "Let's behave, both of you."
Farber later said it was the first time in 13 years that he'd used the gavel.
Weinstein is charged with sexually assaulting Haley and another woman, Kaja Sokola, and raping a third, Jessica Mann. Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify.
Weinstein denies the allegations and his lawyers argue that his accusers had consensual encounters with a then-powerful movie producer who could advance their careers.
