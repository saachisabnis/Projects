Ariana Grande’s dream collaboration is now a reality. The pop superstar has announced a remix of “The Boy Is Mine” featuring R&B legends Brandy and Monica. The remix is set to release on June 21, and fans are eagerly anticipating this iconic union.
Grande shared her excitement on Instagram, writing, “I cannot believe this is real. I don’t know if I will even long after it’s out.” She expressed deep gratitude, stating, “My deepest and sincerest thank you to Brandy and Monica. Your generosity, kindness, and countless ways you have inspired me mean the world.” She continued, “This is in celebration of you both and the impact you have had on every vocalist, vocal producer, musician, and artist today. I love you both so, so much. Thank you!!!!!!”
This collaboration is more than just a musical project for Grande. It’s a full circle moment, given her admiration for Brandy. In a 2013 Billboard article, Grande described Brandy as one of her “most inspirational female singers.” She shared, “I’m obsessed with the sweetness of her voice and I love her songs. Her riffs are also incredibly on point.”
Grande’s respect for Brandy has been evident for years. “Nothing excites me more than an extraordinarily precise run,” she said. “I also met her once and she was just as sweet as can be. I’ve watched the Cinderella with Whitney and Brandy a million times!” Brandy responded to Grande’s admiration, calling her a “mind blowing singer” on Twitter.
The announcement comes shortly after Brandy and Monica made surprise cameos in Grande’s “The Boy Is Mine” music video. This cameo and the upcoming remix mark a significant moment for fans of all three artists. The original “The Boy Is Mine” by Brandy and Monica spent 13 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1998. Now, with Grande’s involvement, the song is being introduced to a new generation.
Grande first hinted at this collaboration by interpolating the hook of the original “The Boy Is Mine” during her performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. With the remix and its accompanying music video, Grande’s “The Boy Is Mine” is poised to be a standout track from her album, “Eternal Sunshine.”
