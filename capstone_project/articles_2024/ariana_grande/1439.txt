Happy beginning of October! The countdown to Halloween has officially begun. With only 29 days to go before partaking in spooky celebrations, the costume-planning excitement is in full swing as searches for “Halloween costumes” have risen 85% over the last month, a new study shows.
Every October, the costumes we see at parties, on the streets, and on social media reflect the most significant cultural moments of the year, as well as iconic movies and TV shows that have gone viral throughout the years and remain timeless.
This year is no different, as fashion experts at British online fashion retailer Boohoo have listed a lineup of characters and themes that we are bound to see this October 31st, inspired by those who have dominated the headlines and our imaginations.

Thanks to the successful release of Deadpool 3, which featured both characters together for the first time, you can expect to see a surge in Deadpool and Wolverine costumes. 
This is especially because of their iconic personalities and costumes, which can be found at costume stores or online, the price depending on the quality.
Certain websites offer adult body suits that are half Deadpool and half Wolverine, retailing for about $50.
However, if in the mood for a little DIY, a Deadpool ensemble can easily be put together through red and black tight pieces, preferably leather, while Wolverine’s costume might need some more creativity to create some claw accessories.

The enduring appeal of Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice has kept the character a staple of Halloween for decades. 
With his wild green hair, which can either be recreated with a wig or some spray hair paint, a striped suit, which can be bought at a costume store, but also in any other apparel shop, and mischievous grin, Beetlejuice remains a beloved choice for those looking to channel their inner ghost. 
To complete it all, add some face paint and practice that scary yet familiar attitude, and Beetlejuice will be ready to come to life.
Given the release of Beetlejuice 2, which has generated a wave of nostalgia and excitement, this iconic character is set to haunt Halloween once again, making a big comeback as one of this year’s top costume picks.

With the release ofDune: Part Two, the characters from this epic sci-fi saga are bound to be popular choices this Halloween. 
From the enigmatic Paul Atreides to the formidable Chani, and even the idea of a unique “sandworm costume” gaining traction, fans have a plethora of options. 
In fact, searches for “sandworm costume” have surged by 270% on Google Trends over the last month, highlighting the growing interest in bringing the vast, mysterious world of Arrakis to life.
A desert-style outfit can be created using flowing robes and scarves in neutral tones. Moreover, online marketplaces like Amazon sell Dune-inspired ensembles for approximately $53.
While these basic looks can be easy to recreate, more detailed costumes such as the sandworm might require DIY efforts and creativity, making it a bit more challenging.

Despite the movie now being one year old, Barbie has left a lasting mark on society, particularly inspiring young girls to chase their dreams and embrace their true selves.
This cultural impact is likely to spill over into this year’s Halloween once again, where the excitement of emulating the iconic doll, with all her flaws and fabulousness, will be just as strong. 
While there are no fixed rules to embody Barbie and Ken, pastel colors, especially pink, are ideal for replicating the iconic looks.

As the musical Wicked continues to captivate audiences on stage, Elphaba and Glinda remain timeless choices for a costume, even better if paired up.
With the upcoming Wicked movie adaptationstarring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo generating buzz, these witchy costumes are sure to cast a spell over Halloween, bringing a bit of Broadway magic to the festivities.
The contrast between the green-skinned misunderstood Elphaba and the bubbly, pink-clad Glinda offers a fun dynamic for pairs or individuals. 
For Elphaba, you’ll need green face paint, a black dress, and a witch’s hat, while Glinda requires a pink gown and a tiara.

Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour has not only been a musical sensation but also a fashionable one. Fans have embraced the idea of celebrating the pop star’s various musical eras, each with its distinct look and vibe.
Whether it’s the country charm of her early days, the edgy style of Reputation, or the pastel hues of Lover, dressing up as Taylor from any era is likely to be a popular and creative costume choice this Halloween. 
Depending on what you’re trying to go for, recreating these outfits can either be quite easy, going for some simpler yet iconic looks like her gowns or two-piece sets, or a lot of work. 
But if you’re up to the challenge of bedazzling an entire bodysuit like the ones she wears on the tour, this will draw all the attention to you.

It’s a simple, affordable costume that fans of the show will instantly recognize, making it a likely hit this Halloween.

Pennywise the Clown from Stephen King’s IT remains a perennial Halloween favorite. Thanks to his unsettling grin and eerie presence, the terrifying, child-hunting clown has become one of the most iconic horror characters.
Recent adaptations have kept the character fresh in public consciousness. Google Trends data suggest a surge in searches for “Pennywise costume” of 138% over the last 30 days, a clear indication that people are looking into recreating the iconic character.
Therefore, Pennywise is set to be once again a popular choice for those looking to scare their way through Halloween, and to recreate it you’ll have to put extra care into the iconic makeup, which is made a lot easier thanks to the pre-made kits available. 
Pair this with an orange wig, a grey shirt with large red buttons, and a red balloon and it will be a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for horror fans.
Alternatively, complete Pennywise ensembles retail for approximately $73 online.

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.

Bet good money you can go to any Halloween Party and see at least three "Australian Breakdancer" costumes.
haha, that is a must! 😸 if you wrongfully get yourself into olympics and get zero points, then I'm sorry but then you had it coming..
I don't get the many kids that want to dress up as the "It"! clown monster. How do they know about the character? Do parents really let their 6-year-olds watch "it"?!??!
I don't get that hype around Taylor Swift. She is just another singer.
