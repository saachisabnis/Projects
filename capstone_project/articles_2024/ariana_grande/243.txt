DW: Well, I always had a thing for Glenda..
Mattel’s "Wicked" dolls have accidentally listed the website of an adult entertainment site instead of the official film website on their packaging. The "Wicked" movie, a new adaptation of the popular Broadway musical, stars Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and is set to premiere in theaters on November 22. However, fans noticed that the back of the dolls' boxes directs users to wicked.com, rather than the correct site, wickedmovie.com.
This mistake appears widespread, as numerous listings on eBay show the same error on Mattel’s packaging. Other "Wicked" merchandise, like a LEGO set, displays the correct site. The dolls are being marketed to children aged 4 and up. Alongside Grande and Erivo, the film features Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Peter Dinklage, and Jeff Goldblum.
