Tom Cruise gave the Paris Olympics closing ceremony a Hollywood flair when he dove off the top of the Stade de France to mark the handover from the Paris Olympics to the L.A. Games in 2028.

	After H.E.R. played the U.S. national anthem, the actor jumped off the roof of the Stade de France — the country’s biggest stadium — and landed on stage. He was welcomed with deafening cheers and greeted by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who was handed the Olympic flag by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo during the bash. He then hopped onto a motorcycle with the flag in tow and rode out of the stadium to make the symbolic delivery to L.A. As the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “By the Way” played in the background, Cruise rode down the Paris streets and drove into a plane. In a pre-recorded segment, he then parachuted out of the aircraft, landing by the Hollywood sign. Once he touched down at the famous landmark, Cruise attached the five Olympic rings to it.

Games’ handover festivities, along with Grammy, Oscar and Emmy winner H.E.R., who performed the U.S. national anthem. Famous French bands Phoenix and Air as well as Belgian pop star Angele performed earlier in then event, which was orchestrated by Paris Olympics artistic director Thomas Jolly alongside executive director Thierry Reboul.

	Speaking to reporters in Paris on Friday, Bass said the L.A. Games “will really show the diversity and the international character of our city.” 

	“And we do have Hollywood, so I expect a lot of magical opportunities, which might begin at the closing ceremony,” Bass told Reuters. She also said she wants to replicate the joy she’s seen across Paris during these Olympics.

	The Paris Olympics have set a high standard by hosting almost all competitions at iconic landmarks, from the Place de la Concorde, the Eiffel Tower, the Chateau de Versailles and Grand Palais. The blockbuster opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics also took place outdoors for the first time in modern history. It ran along the Seine River and featured Lady Gaga and Celine Dion.
