Cynthia Erivo has made history as the second Black actress to portray Elphaba in a major production of the beloved musical “Wicked.” This role — characterized by her green skin —  symbolizes the struggles of being an outcast, a theme that resonates deeply with audiences, particularly within Black communities. Erivo’s performance brings a fresh perspective to Elphaba’s journey, highlighting the intersection of race, identity and resilience.
Elphaba’s character has always been a powerful representation of the fight against societal norms and prejudices. However, with a Black woman in the role, the narrative takes on a new depth. The challenges Elphaba faces — fear, humiliation and rejection — mirror the experiences of many Black women who often find themselves marginalized and misunderstood. The character resonates with Black women in this particular moment in light of Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat in the 2024 election, in which 92 percent of them voted for her as a strategy against the policies President-elect Trump and his administration plan to implement. Erivo’s portrayal allows audiences to see their own struggles reflected in Elphaba’s defiance against a world that seeks to diminish her.
One of the most iconic moments in Wicked is the song “Defying Gravity.” In this climactic scene, Elphaba rejects the manipulative forces of The Wizard and Madame Morrible, choosing instead to embrace her true self. This moment is not just a turning point in the story; it serves as a powerful anthem for anyone who has ever felt constrained by societal expectations. Erivo’s rendition of the song resonates with Black women who have often been expected to remain silent in the face of adversity.
As Elphaba sings, “I’m through accepting limits / ‘Cause someone says they’re so,” it becomes a rallying cry for empowerment. The emotional weight of her performance captures the essence of resilience, reminding us that we all have the strength to rise above the challenges we face.
Unfortunately, Elphaba’s journey does not end with her triumphant moment. In the second act of the musical, she becomes the target of vicious rumors and lies, a situation that many Black women can relate to. The narrative illustrates how standing up for oneself can lead to being labeled as “angry” or indeed “wicked.” This is a reality that extends beyond the stage, as seen in the public scrutiny faced by figures like Vice President Harris.
Elphaba’s desire to be true to herself and help others is overshadowed by the false narratives spun by those in power. This reflects a broader societal issue where Black women are often vilified for asserting their voices and opinions.
Looking forward to Wicked Part Two, audiences can anticipate a continuation of Elphaba’s struggle against the forces that seek to undermine her. The second act will delve deeper into her character, showcasing her vulnerabilities and the complexities of her relationships, particularly with Glinda. Songs like “As Long As You’re Mine” and “No Good Deed” will further explore Elphaba’s emotional journey, revealing her depth and humanity.
The highly anticipated duet “For Good” between Elphaba and Glinda promises to be a poignant moment, encapsulating themes of forgiveness and growth. With Erivo and Ariana Grande taking on these roles, fans can expect an emotional performance that will leave a lasting impact.
Cynthia Erivo’s portrayal of Elphaba has transformed Wicked into a richer and more meaningful experience. Her performance not only honors the character’s legacy but also elevates the narrative to reflect the realities of Black womanhood. As Wicked continues to captivate audiences in theaters, the upcoming release of Wicked Part Two on Nov. 21, 2025, is sure to further explore these themes of identity, resilience and empowerment.
In a world that often seeks to diminish the voices of Black women, Erivo’s Elphaba stands as a powerful reminder of the strength found in embracing one’s true self and defying the odds.
