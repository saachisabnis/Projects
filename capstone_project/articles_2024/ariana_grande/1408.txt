Toy giant Mattel says it "deeply" regrets an error on the packaging of its "Wicked" movie-themed dolls, which mistakenly links toy buyers to a pornographic website.
The error gained attention on social media over the weekend, where numerous users shared photos of the URL printed on the back of the boxes for the special edition dolls, which feature characters from the movie adaptation of "Wicked" set to hit theaters later this month. Instead of linking to Universal Pictures' official WickedMovie.com page, the website listed leads to an adult film site that requires consumers to be over 18 to enter.
In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Mattel said it was "made aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls," which it said are primarily sold in the U.S. "We deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this," the company added.

Mattel did not confirm whether this action included removing unsold products with the incorrect link from stores. But as of Monday morning, at least some of these "Wicked" dolls appeared to be no longer available or not in stock on sites like Amazon, Target and Mattel.
In the meantime, the company is advising consumers who already have the dolls to discard their packaging or obscure the link â€” and contact Mattel's customer service for more information.
Mattel unveiled its special "Wicked" collection earlier this year. Back in July, a promotion shared on Instagram showed Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who star as Elphaba and Glinda in Universal Pictures' upcoming film, seeing the line's singing dolls for the first time.
The beloved Broadway musical has been split into two parts for its movie adaptation. The first chapter of "Wicked" will hit theaters on Nov. 22, with part two set for a fall 2025 release.
