On Wednesday in New York City, Justin Timberlake graced the stage and shocked audiences with his reaction to Britney Spears‘ recent apology.
Before performing “Holy Grail” and “Cry Me a River,” the singer addressed the crowd, saying, “I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely f**king nobody,” as seen in footage posted by Instagram user @gilbertohoraa. While this occurred, Timberlake’s wife, Jessica Biel, was in attendance and led the audience in singing “Happy Birthday” to celebrate the star’s 43rd birthday, and a cake was presented to him, which was captured by TikTok user Makeup by Helenn.
“I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely f—ing nobody,” Justin Timberlake said during his set at Irving Plaza in New York City Wednesday night right before performing “Cry Me a River.” You may recall a few days ago, Britney Spears posted (then deleted) an apology to Justin for some of the things she wrote in her book, ‘The Woman In Me.’  “I wanna apologize for some of the things I wrote about in my book,” Britney wrote. “If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about I am deeply sorry… I also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake’s new song ‘Selfish’ 🌹 It is soo good.” #justintimberlake #britneyspears 
This comment was in response to Britney Spears’ recent Instagram post, where she apologized for some of the content in her memoir, The Woman in Me, while also commending Justin’s new single, “Selfish.” This release marks his return to the limelight after the book revealed details about their past relationship, which cast Timberlake in a negative light.
Spears wrote, “I wanna apologize for some of the things I wrote about in my book. If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about, I am deeply sorry… I also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake’s new song ‘Selfish.’ It is soo good… How come every time I see Justin and Jimmy [Fallon] together I laugh so hard??? Ps ‘Sanctified’ is wow too.”
As Britney praised Justin, her fans rallied behind her 2011 hit song “Selfish” and propelled it up the charts in a show of support for the pop princess.
WELP. Britney Spears had something to say about that.
Now, Britney is seemingly clapping back at Justin on Instagram. She wrote, “Someone told me someone was talking sh*t about me on the streets !!! Do you want to bring it to the court or will you go home crying to your mom like you did last time??? I’m not sorry !!!”
