The long-anticipated film adaptation of Wicked, (Part One), featuring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda, has finally hit theaters, but some people are bummed that no singing is allowed. Don't worry though, that will change soon.
If you went to see 'Wicked: Part One' on opening weekend, I'm sure you noticed a new warning added to the movie watching no-no list: No talking, no texting, and NO SINGING.
According to Variety;
Interactive showings of Universal’s upcoming movie musical will be offered in roughly 1,000 North American cinemas starting on Dec. 25
Ok, cool! Now the big question is; what Illinois theaters will the interactive 'Wicked' showings be coming to?
Here's the answer...for now...from WGN in Chicago;
Specific theater locations that will offer the sing-alongs have not yet been announced.
Bummer. I think it's a safe bet some movie theaters in the Chicago area will be showing the special interactive screenings of 'Wicked', but what about Showplace 16 in Rockford and Showplace 14 in Machesney Park? The truth shall be revealed soon.
