	Inspired by The Beatles‘ iconic Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, “Smeraldo Garden Marching Band” masterfully blends hip-hop beats with the lively, brassy sound of a marching band. Jimin collaborated once again with renowned producers Pdogg, GHSTLOOP, and EVAN, who previously worked on his debut solo album, FACE.

	The impressive production team also includes Tommy Brown, known for his work with Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and Mr. Franks.

	The song’s title references the fictional flower “Smeraldo,” which symbolizes “the truth untold.”

	The lyrics delve into themes of longing and unspoken love, connecting to the “Smeraldo” legend previously mentioned in BTS’ “The Truth Untold” featuring Steve Aoki from their LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘Tear’ album.

	The accompanying music video, out now via HYBE LABELS’ YouTube channel, opens with a serene landscape before zooming in on Jimin, who performs as the lead vocalist with producers Pdogg, GHSTLOOP, and EVAN playing as the band’s musicians, and a special appearance by Loco. The video’s nostalgic, vintage feel is amplified by cinematic opening credits and a faded, grainy texture while showcasing Jimin’s smooth dance moves and versatile voice.

MUSE, Jimin’s highly anticipated second solo album seven will feature interconnected tracks, all revolving around the theme of love. 

	The album’s tracklist includes “Rebirth,” “Interlude: Showtime,” “Smeraldo Garden Marching Band” featuring Loco, “Slow Dance” featuring Sofia Carson, “Be Mine,” “Who,” and “Closer Than This,” which was released in December.

	Jimin has wowed audiences across the globe with his distinctive vocals and impressive range, as demonstrated in solo tracks like “Lie,” “Serendipity,” and “Promise,” as well as collaborations such as “With you” from the Our Blues OST and “VIBE” with Taeyang. 

	His debut solo album, FACE, made history when he became the first South Korean solo artist to top the Billboard Hot 100.

	BTS, consisting of RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, have enjoyed a meteoric rise since their debut in June 2013. 

	










	The group is celebrated worldwide for their self-produced music, packed performances, and deep connection with their fans, known as ARMY. They have achieved numerous accolades, including six No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 singles and multiple sold-out stadium shows worldwide.

	“Smeraldo Garden Marching Band” featuring Loco is out now, while MUSE drops July 19.
