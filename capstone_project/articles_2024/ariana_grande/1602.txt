With Pete Davidson's Prehab Tour coming to the Coronado on Saturday, July 27th in Rockford, here are 12 local places we think he'll visit while he's in town.
It's not completely delusional of me to think Pete Davidson would hit up a few of our local bars in downtown Rockford after his show.  Why?  George Lopez spent his night at Cj's Public House after his show, who says Pete won't do the same?!

I have a strong feeling Minnihan's or Mary's Place are more his vibe, though.  Obviously I don't know the man personally, but you never know his next move - considering all the women he's dated; Ariana Grande, Kim Kardashian... those were major plot twists none of us saw coming.

We took it to Facebook and asked everyone where they thought Pete Davidson would visit while he's in Rockford.  Here are the top 12 local spots that were mentioned:
Whether it's for breakfast, lunch, late night dinner, a beer or glass of wine, or just a place to satisfy his munchies, he's bound to stop somewhere.  Right?!
Also, this isn't a suggestion but I think we can we all agree with this comment: "All i know is if your girlfriend is hot, keep her at the crib while Pete is in town..." 
If you really, really want to get a glimpse of Pete Davidson in person, maybe grab a few tickets... or a single ticket if your boo won't go with you!  He'll be in Rockford on Saturday, July 27th at the Coronado.
