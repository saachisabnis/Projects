Ariana Grande has long been hailed as a style queen.
While she may be a fashion expert now, it took Grande a few years in the spotlight to nail her dramatic style.
When Grade first graced the small screen in 2010 as Cat Valentine in Victorious, she looked trendy in blue skinny jeans, graphic T-shirts and mini dresses.
Through the years, the singer elevated her style to glamorous gowns. For instance, at the 2016 Grammy Awards, the performer stunned in a simple crimson Romona Keveza gown that fit like a glove and featured elegant buttons down the front bodice. But for the American Music Awards that same year, she opted for white tuxedo pants with a cropped lace tank.
