 Alana Jackson, Office Manager at Freeman Street Market, told Grimsby Live: "The idea for this event was first brought to us by Unity Community, a supportive, creative community group for all ages in Lincolnshire, who hosted the LGBTQ+, Friends and Alliesâ€™ Group last year.
"It was a huge success in bringing people together, offering support and advice, and creating a fun, inclusive atmosphere. Unity Community was enthusiastic about returning this year, and their passion and commitment are at the heart of this event.
"Our Pride event aims to spread positivity and highlight the diversity within our community, emphasising how Freeman Street Market is a welcoming and inclusive place for all."
