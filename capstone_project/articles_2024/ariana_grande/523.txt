Jelly Roll made it a family affair on the 2024 Kids' Choice Awards red carpet in Santa Monica.
The Son Of A Sinner star, 39 — who recently revealed he's struggling to book international tour dates — brought his two kids to the annual ceremony on Saturday night and walked the star-studded red carpet. 
For the occasion, Jelly Roll posed up in a paisley patterned denim button-up shirt and black pants.
The hitmaker paired the look with layered silver chains and blue Nike sneakers as he posed up a storm.
He coordinated with his daughter Bailee Ann, 16, and son Noah Buddy, 8, in denim get-ups.

Bailee looked stylish is a denim vest and jeans while Noah sported a denim jacket and jeans. 
Jelly Roll presented an award on stage alongside supermodel Heidi Klum, which resulted in the country singer getting slimed.
His appearance at the awards show comes just weeks after the singer opened up about his weightless journey and goal of running a 5k by Thanksgiving.
'As long as I'm training for this thing, I'm just shedding weight,' Jelly said to People. 'I've been eating crazy good, so I'm excited.'
In April he told the outlet that he was 'probably down 70-something pounds' amid his revised regimen.
'I've been really kicking a**, man,' Jelly Roll said. 'I'm doing two to three miles a day, four to six days a week. I'm doing 20 to 30 minutes in the sauna, six minutes in a cold plunge every day. I'm eating healthy right now.'
The 37th Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards arrived at the Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles on Saturday.
This year's ceremony celebrated the 25th anniversary of SpongeBob SquarePants.
The star-studded event was hosted by the titular character and Patrick Star, with Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke reprising their roles for the very first time the ceremony will feature virtual hosts.
