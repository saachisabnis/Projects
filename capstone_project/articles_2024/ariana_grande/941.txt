A new show is coming to Liverpool this year. Tickets are on sale for Candlelight: Best of Bridgerton on Strings in the beautiful Grade II listed St George's Hall.
The 'one-of-a-kind' experience will feature hits from the Netflix show in a unique live multi-sensory musical experience with thousands of candles and display of blossoms that will transport guests to the Regency era. The shows will take place on November 9 and 14 and January 11, 2025 at 6pm and 8.30pm.
The setlist will feature songs from the show including Billie Eilish's Bad Guy, thank u, next by Ariana Grande, Give Me Everything by Pitbull, Afrojack, Ne-Yo and Nayer, Cheap Thrills by Sia, and more performed by a talented string quartet. String Infusion Quartet, an all-female electric-acoustic ensemble, are set to perform the hits.
