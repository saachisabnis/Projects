Childish Gambino/Donald Glover officially unveiled his upcoming album ATAVISTA — although the record isn’t entirely new.
The project is being billed as an “updated” version of his last studio album 3.15.20, which recently commemorated its fourth anniversary. Eagle-eyed fans noted that ATAVISTA is essentially the properly-titled edition of 3.15.20 but with a few changes: the track “32.22” is not included in tracklist Gambino shared on social media, and his popular 2018 single “Feels Like Summer” (entitled “42.26” on 3.15.20) is replaced with “Human Sacrifice.”
3.15.20 was originally released on the Donald Glover website but was taken down 12 hours after, and appeared on official streaming services about a week later. The 13-track record featured guest appearances from Ariana Grande, Kadhja Bonet, 21 Savage and Ink, marked the artist’s first full-length effort since his GRAMMY-nominated album Awaken, My Love! from 2016.
