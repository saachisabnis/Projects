The Investigation Discovery documentary breaks down what child stars and staff alike went through while working for Nickelodeon in the 1990s to early 2000s. With the release of a bonus episode airing in April 2024, viewers are wondering if more episodes are in the works.

There has been no news of a sixth episode as of yet.
However, Investigation Discovery confirmed news of a fifth episode weeks after its four original episodes aired in March 2024. Episode 5 was titled “Breaking the Silence,” and was released on April 7, 2024.
In the fifth installment, more startling claims were made as previous and additional Nickelodeon stars spoke about revelations that were brought to light from the prior episodes.
Following the episode’s premiere, viewers expressed their disappointment, accusing the documentary makers of “milking” the series.
One viewer wrote, “I feel like episode 5 of quiet on set was a little unnecessary 🫤 I’m glad we’re having open dialogue on this topic, but it seems like they’re milking it atp,” while another posted: “Quiet On Set episode 5 didn’t need to happen and didn’t add anything to the story.”
That being said, it’s unlikely that more episodes will be dropping anytime soon.
ICYMI, Quiet on Set documents the abuse Nickelodeon actors and crew members went through, it specifically focuses on longtime producer Dan Schneider, who created shows and is responsible for launching the careers of major stars like Amanda Bynes and Ariana Grande. The film series details Schneider’s alleged bizarre behavior on set, which included inappropriate jokes, massages and gender disparity.
