#1 FOR NEW COUNTRY
There's no doubt that the 2024 holiday season has become Wicked! The beloved Broadway musical is now a box office-smashing and gravity-defying movie. Here in my hometown of Owensboro, Kentucky, nearly every single showing of the film is selling out.
Ariana Grande (Glinda) and Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba) are captivating audiences and belting the show's sweeping and powerful score through those Dolby Atmos speakers. Wicked, after just its opening weekend, has already become, domestically, the highest grossing movie ever based on a Broadway musical.
As expected, and as you can see, Wicked is popular. Yes, that pun was intentional.
It's so popular, some folks are getting really creative with their holiday light displays and are incorporating Wicked into their Christmas celebrations.
Here's a prime example. I stumbled across this 'wicked' light show on YouTube over the weekend. Their holiday show is built around Wicked's show-stopping "Defying Gravity."
Here's another one! Honestly, this display is even more elaborate and impressive. It's presented by Lunar Family Lights, which is a private, residential show in Florida. This particular show is free, but the family does collect optional donations. All those donations, according to the family's YouTube channel, go directly to Give Kids the World Village.
And here's one more for you. This is the mastermind of Showstopper Sequences, a family in Ozark, Missouri that have designed a variety of popular Christmas light shows. Their 2024 offerings include Wicked, an stirring tribute that even features a singing Elphaba.
