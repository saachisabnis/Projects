Brandy recently spoke to E! News about teaming with Ariana Grande and Monica on “The Boy is Mine (Remix).” “Ariana called us and wanted us to be part of the remix, and we immediately said yes because I’m such a huge fan of hers. She’s one of the greatest singers ever,” Brandy said. “So I thought the song was great, and the moment with Monica and I was great. ‘The Boy of Mine’ was so huge for us. It’s our biggest song together so to come back together and do it again, it’s like a blessing to be able to get a second chance at it.”
