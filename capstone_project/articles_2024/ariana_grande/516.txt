Ariana Grande is having a massive week on Billboard’s charts. Along with claiming the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, the No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 and reigning as the No. 1 act on the Billboard Artist 100, she also rules the Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts for the first time.

	As such, Grande becomes just the fourth artist to top all five of those surveys simultaneously, a feat achieved just 10 times since Billboard launched the songwriter and producer charts in 2019. Here’s a look at every such week.

	Taylor Swift has led all five charts simultaneously a record seven times, and via three albums: Red (Taylor’s Version), Midnights and 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The Weeknd and Zach Bryan have both achieved the feat once, thanks to their LPs After Hours and Zach Bryan, respectively.

	Grande tops the latest Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts thanks to her credits on all 12 of her charting songs on the Hot 100, all from Eternal Sunshine. Notably, she’s the only co-songwriter and co-producer on all 12 songs. Here’s a recap.

Rank, TitleNo. 1, “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)”No. 10, “Yes, And?” (up from No. 31; debuted at No. 1 on Jan. 27)No. 16, “The Boy Is Mine”No. 17, “Supernatural”No. 23, “Eternal Sunshine”No. 25, “Bye”No. 28, “Don’t Wanna Break Up Again”No. 30, “True Story”No. 37, “Imperfect for You”No. 38, “Intro (End of the World)”No. 39, “I Wish I Hated You”No. 55, “Ordinary Things,” feat. Nonna

	










Eternal Sunshine is Grande’s first album cycle in which she’s credited as a co-producer. She logged her first career Hot 100 entry as a credited producer on “Yes, And?,” with Max Martin and ILYA. Of the 12 charting songs from the set, Martin is a co-producer on all but “Intro (End of the World)” and “I Wish I Hated You.” ILYA co-produced all except “Intro,” “Supernatural” and “Ordinary Things.” Martin and ILYA rank at Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, on Hot 100 Producers.

	Martin has an unprecedented history on Billboard’s charts, having produced a record 25 No. 1 songs on the Hot 100. He tallied his record-breaking 24th leader in January with “Yes, And?” (passing late Beatles mastermind George Martin). He tallies his 25th with “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love).”

	As for ILYA, 26 of Grande’s Hot 100-charting entries have been produced or co-produced by the hitmaker, including her two most recent No. 1s, as well as her first top five hit, “Problem,” featuring Iggy Azalea, in 2014. He also co-produced Sam Smith and Kim Petras’ 2022 No. 1 “Unholy,” along with songs by Justin Bieber, Jonas Brothers, Lizzo and Normani.

Billboard’s weekly Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts are based on total points accrued by a songwriter and producer, respectively, for each attributed song that appears on the Hot 100. As with Billboard’s yearly recaps, multiple writers or producers split points for each song equally (and the dividing of points will lead to occasional ties on rankings). Billboard launched its Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts, as well as genre-specific rankings for country, rock & alternative, R&B/hip-hop, R&B, rap, Latin, Christian, gospel and dance/electronic in June 2019. Alternative and hard rock joined in 2020, along with seasonal holiday rankings in 2022.
