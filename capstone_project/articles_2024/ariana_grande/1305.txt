Fans who want to see Ariana Grande on tour again may have to wait a little bit longer as touring isn't top of mind for the Wicked star at the moment.
Speaking to Variety, Grande said that even though she'll always keep music in her life, she is heading in a different direction, career-wise, over the next few years, and doesn't see herself touring. She explained, "I feel so grateful to the acting, and I think my fans know that music and being on stage will always be a part of my life, but I don’t see it coming anytime soon. I think the next few years, hopefully we'll be exploring different forms of art, and I think acting is feeling like home right now."
Grande added, "I am appreciative for [my fans'] understanding. I’m so grateful for the ways in which we've grown together over this whole journey with Wicked. But music will always be a part of my life." She joked, "I'll perform at my mother's house."
While Wicked was still in production, Grande released her latest album, Eternal Sunshine, which includes "Yes, And?" and "We Can't Be Friends (Wait For Your Love)," but no plans for a tour were announced.
Ariana was recently nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture category, for her role as Glinda in Wicked, and will carry over her part into the film's second part, Wicked: For Good which is set to hit theaters in November 2025.
