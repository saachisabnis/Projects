While some spend Christmas Day at home around the tree, many people head straight to the movie theater. Luckily, whether you need a family-friendly flick or want to get ahead on your awards season viewings, there are plenty of films to watch in cinemas on December 25.
Kid-friendly options were released earlier (more on those later), so the Christmas Day release list largely consists of R-rated flicks starring major A-Listers.
Babygirl (R) – Nicole Kidman plays a businesswoman who seemingly has it all with a husband (Antonio Banderas), two kids at home while she acts as CEO of her tech company. However, she puts everything on the line when she indulges her submissive fantasies and has an affair with her young intern (Harris Dickinson). Kidman scored a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the erotic thriller.
A Complete Unknown (R) – Timothée Chalamet plays 19-year-old Bob Dylan as he arrives in New York City and begins his meteoric rise to fame. Edward Norton, Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro also star in this biopic, which is up for three Golden Globes.
Nosferatu (R) – Realtor Thomas Hutter (Nicholas Hoult) is searching for a house for the wealthy Transylvanian Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) in this remake of the 1922 short film. Thomas learns that Orlok is a vampire, and he’s taken a liking to Thomas’ wife Ellen (Lily-Rose Depp). Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin and Willem Dafoe also star.
The Fire Inside (PG-13) – This biopic follows professional boxer Claressa “T-Rex” Shields (Ryan Destiny) as she trains for the 2012 Summer Olympics with coach Jason Crutchfield (Brian Tyree Henry). She becomes the first American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in the sport.
While some cinemas will bring beloved Christmas classics like Love Actually and The Grinch back to theaters, there is only one new holiday film on the big screen in 2024: Red One. After Santa Claus is kidnapped, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson plays an E.L.F. (Extremely Large and Formidable) operative who joins forces with a bounty hunter and perpetual naughty lister (played by Chris Evans) to track down St. Nick. Lucy Liu, J.K. Simmons, Bonnie Hunt and Kiernan Shipka also star in the flick, which is also available to stream on Prime Video.
There’s no time like Christmas vacation to catch up on your moviegoing — or to see Wicked for the third time. No judgement.
