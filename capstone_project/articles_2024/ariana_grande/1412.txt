People getting personal over whether or not Lady Gaga gets another Oscar nom is insane to me. It’s an awards show that’s months away it’s not the presidential election lol. 
I was thinking exactly the same way until I started to see Gaga’s trajectory from an unbiased perspective. She starred in three movies, and all the choices she made have been stellar compared to other well-established actresses: A Star Is Born, House of Gucci, and Joker 2. These are all high-profile movies for big studios and against mega stars. So it makes sense that her fans are excited about her second nomination potential.
Let's see who's 2026 ingénue Oscars pundits will root for.
Darling, cheap wizard of oz will not getting any acting nominations. 
cheap? Movie adapted from a Tony award winning broadway musical that has the second highest box office of all time for a broadway musical play?
 stop being delulu 
if everything all at once can garner so many nomination and America Ferrara can get a supporting actress nom for Barbie… anything is possible lol
Jesus Christ, some people are really delusional and it shows 
C’mon Joan Chen! And kudos to Sean Wang! Heartfelt, authentic, humorous, joyous.
Joan’s quiet nuanced perf deserves the nod.
The Sunne in Splendour.

America’s movie made over 1B dollars at the box office and was a cultural phenomenon that was a success during awards season
let’s be serious for a minute

avatar one and two made over billions of dollars and was a cultural phenomenon… did not garner any acting nominations.
Margot Robbie did not get Oscar nom as well for Barbie and she’s the center of it all lol so I still stand in the corner where anything is possible

 So it wasn’t about the performance then cos Lady Gaga looks a billion times better and more baity than America Ferrara

if anything, with what you said you just made us doubt of ariana’s chances even more 😭
Recently, I attended a private screening of Azazel Jacobs’ domestic drama His Three Daughters, and since it arrives on Netflix today, I thought I’d review it here for those of you who haven’t seen it.
For all the hype and Oscar buzz surrounding His Three Daughters, I’m ambivalent about it. Not because of it’s shopworn premise (watching it, I was reminded especially of Ingmar Bergman’s Cries and Whispers and Woody Allen’s Interiors), subject matter (mortality), themes (grief, sisterhood), or it’s confined setting (I love chamber dramas; Fences, The Humans, Mass, am I right?). I’m ambivalent about it, because while it has all the makings of a great film, much of it is a drag.
In the film’s dialogue-laden ninety-seven minutes (the other six are reserved for its opening and closing credits), Jacobs (who wrote and directed the film) doesn’t say much at all. We never connect to the characters or their backstories. We never understand why oldest sister Katie (Carrie Coon) and middle sister Rachel (Natasha Lyonne) resent each other or why Benjy (Jovan Adepo) oversteps his boundaries as Rachel’s boyfriend and confronts both Katie and their youngest sister, Christina (Elizabeth Olsen), when he only has issues with Katie. It takes 45 minutes for anything remotely exciting to happen (an argument between Katie and Rachel) and for the film to find its footing.
Still, Sam Levy’s cinematography is stunning, Jacobs’ direction is flawless, and the acting from leading ladies Coon, Lyonne, and Olsen is good, really good. But none of their performances elevate the material they’re saddled with and none of them—barring Coon, in a weaker year for Lead Actress—are Oscar worthy. That honor goes to the men of the film: the aforementioned Adepo and Jay O. Sanders, who portrays the the sisters’ father Vincent (his ten minute performance and monologue in the film’s final twenty minutes reduced me to tears). I have no doubt that had Netflix released His Three Daughters in any other year (i.e. the 2023 ceremony), one or the other—my money’s on Sanders—would reap a non-win competitive Supporting Actor bid (i.e. Bryan Tyree Henry in Causeway or Judd Hirsch in The Fabelmans).
Overall, I rate His Three Daughters 3.5 out of 5 stars (70%).
I'll always speak truth to power.

I think we are underestimating Ariana grande getting a nomination, she’s stellar in all the clips I’ve seen of her. Her role in movie would be a good light contrast against heavier darker competitors. it would be fun to see lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, Ariana as supporting actress noms esp since they’re friends in real life and they collaborate creatively as well. And throw in saoirse Ronan for blitz since she will get along with them although she’s not a singer, she has such a sweet personality and I can see her jam with them at award shows haha 
what’s so stellar about her in the clips? only thing I remember is that first “yOu’Re GreEen!!!” that social media mocked lol

and it was so bad that the scene was cut it out and another cut got into the last trailer. I think it’s perfectly fine to predict whoever you want, but sometimes, who predicts Grande to get nominated seem so unserious. She’s in a musical fantasy film and she isn’t Meryl Streep or Ian McKellen to be able to go that far. Her ceiling clearly is the Globes
Since Ariana is in supporting now I don’t think she can even make it in globes
