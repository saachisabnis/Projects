Everything that Rocks the River City
Is Chicago's biggest music festival popular because of the music? Or is it because it's one of the most 'Instagrammable' festivals in the U.S.?Â 
The sun is shining, you ditched your winter coat (hopefully) until the holidays and it is time to start thinking about what concerts you're hitting up this summer!
Will you find your favorite band on tour... or will you get tickets to a giant music festival instead? If you pick the fest, you're in for way more than just music. You're in for an 'Instagrammable' experience.
If we're talking Illinois, then the top music festival of the year is absolutely Lollapalooza! In fact, it's not just leading festivals in Illinois, it's actually the second most 'Instagrammable,' festival in the country this year.
Lolla is 'Instagrammable,' that's for sure. My one (and probably only) visit to Lollapalooza was the summer of 2019 with Steve Shannon's former producer, MJ. We had a BLAST listening to some huge artists - Ariana Grande was headlining that year (!) - but we also spent a huge chunk of time taking photos for the 'gram, duh.
And we aren't alone.
According to NoDeposit365.com, Lolla takes the second place spot on their Most 'Instagrammable' Festival list because of the more than 1,557,300 IG posts using #Lollapalooza each year.
You know our friends up North aren't doing so bad either, Summerfest landed in 8th place on this list, with the Milwaukee festival grabbing more than 472,800 Instagram posts in 2023.
Are you more into festival music or festival photos?
