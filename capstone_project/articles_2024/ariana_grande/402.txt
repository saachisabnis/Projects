New photos of Ariana Grande at the London premiere of Wicked have reignited health concerns about the artist, as fans comment on her appearing worryingly thin. 
Posing at the Royal Festival Hall on Monday (November 18), the31-year-old artist displayed her slim shoulders in a strapless yellow dress.
On November 9, the Thank U, Next singer sparked concerns when she appeared at theLos Angeles premiere of the musical film, which hits theaters on November 22. 
While some fans said theFlorida-born star looked “skeletal,” others considered the speculation around her health to be intrusive and a form of body-shaming.

Similar comments followed Ariana’sappearance on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday (November 15), where the actress, who plays Glinda in the Jon M. Chu-directed film, donned a strapless pink dress.
“I’m usually Ariana’s biggest defender when it comes to her weight but she’s actually starting to look VERY sickly. This cannot be healthy,” a concerned fan wrote, sharing asketch featuring Ariana and Jimmy.
“This is my first time EVER speaking on her body. She’s only gotten skinner since yes and was released it’s hard not to be concerned,” the user added on X (formerly known as Twitter).
“As someone who has been severely underweight, Ari does look very much so underweight here,” a separate user agreed.

“I’ve been thinking this but stay silent because everybody wants to sit on their high horse and crucify anyone that mentions their concern. I’ve been a fan of Ari for YEARS and it’s worrying to see this in her,” another fan shared.
“So our solution is to degrade her on the internet?” somebody else interjected. “I’m sure she’s well aware of how she looks. She could have a medical condition for all the internet knows.”
“Please focus on her talent, not her looks. Health is private, let’s support her well-being,” another commenter added, while a separate fan said, “Please do not comment on other peoples bodies, thank you.”

Following Ariana’s appearance at the London premiere, people have been drawing attention to two TikTok videos comparing the performer’s appearance in 2018 and 2024.
In thefirst video, Ariana’s 2018 interview with Jimmy Fallon is contrasted with her most recent one, in which her jawline appears more pronounced.
Thesecond clip features two red carpet interviews with the star, which some social media users have argued look drastically different.

Last year, Ariana posted athree-minute-long video asking people to be “gentler” and to stop commenting on her body.
“I just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to be a person with a body [that’s] seen and paid such close attention to,” she began.
“I think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people’s bodies, no matter what.
“If you think you’re saying something good or well-intentioned, whatever it is—healthy or unhealthy, big or small, this or that, sexy or not sexy—we should really work towards not doing that as much.
“There are ways to compliment someone or to ignore something you see that you don’t like.”

Ariana said that the older version of herself people were comparing her to wasn’t as healthy as they believed.
“There are many different kinds of beautiful. There are many different ways to look healthy and beautiful,” she continued.
“And personally for me, the body that you’ve been comparing my current body to was the unhealthiest version of my body.”
Ariana revealed that at the time she was “on a lot of antidepressants” and “drinking [while] on them.”
Additionally, while people thought she looked healthy, she was “eating poorly and at the lowest point of her life.”

“I know I shouldn’t have to explain that, but I do feel like maybe having an openness or vulnerability, something good might come from it. Healthy can look different.”
The songwriter urged viewers to be careful when speculating about other people’s appearances, even if they’re “coming from a loving and caring place.”
“You never know what somebody’s going through. That person is probably working on it or has a support system that they’re working on it with. You never know, so be gentle with each other and yourselves.”
Bored Panda has contacted Ariana Grande’s representatives for comment.

I don't think it's anyone's business. She has access to medical professionals. She's well off. This shouldn't even be a post. Judgemental and unprofessional opinions. It's not right.
People say they care.. but they're hurting her and making it worse with this thread.
-- *How thin are the Japanese from Japan?* They're one of the healthiest countries. I'd look at that more over what Americans say especially majority are obese!--
She's 5'1. I'm 5'5 and 110lbs/115lbs. I'm healthy and athletic and eat well. Doctors say I'm in great health and in great shape. I rarely get sick and have great stamina. I feel great. She's 5'1 about the same weight. 110lbs or a bit under. Again she's 5'1.
I disagree. It's a touchy subject, for sure, but if it truly is anorexia - which is a far more fatal disease than people realize - should people not speak out? It's a terrifying form of self-harm that one rarely finds their way out of on their own. I find this very important to be talked about, especially since she is such a champion to many young girls. Just to be clear: People shouldn't assume or judge, but the question of: 'Is she truly alright' is very much okay to be asked, I think.
Get off your high virtue signaling horse. People can have opinions and you're not the opinion police.
Who, me? If me starting politely with "I disagree" and then laying out an issue that is very important to me is virtue signaling in your book, then I guess we have different definitions. Also, tone. Calm down please.

Give me a break. For one: this is her own private business. Secondly, a bunch of y'all who are "concerned" about Ariana Grande are the same folks that celebrate the "body positivity" of dangerously obese people like Lizzo. Seems a little silly to me. Both women are people with enough money and support to get whatever help they need, should they choose.
