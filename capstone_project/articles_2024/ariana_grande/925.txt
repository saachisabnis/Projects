“Elphaba” may have been a little late for Halloween, but her fans were not disappointed in the least Friday afternoon.
Cynthia Erivo, who portrays “Elphaba” in the upcoming film “Wicked,” participated in a question and answer session at the Target store in Jersey City.
The film’s costume designer, Paul Tazewell, joined the discussion. The event was part of the promotion for the film, which also stars Ariana Grande.
The store was transformed in the Land of Oz, with installations, photo stations and specialty baskets ― even the bollards outside the store were decorated for the film.
