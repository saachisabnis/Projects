Are you as hyped for Wicked as we are? The upcoming movie-musical – starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda – is set for a 27 November release date, and we simply cannot wait for the project, based off this sneak peek image alone! While we’ll have to wait several months to see Erivo and Grande in their full-on theatrical costumes, Grande is holding fans over with her latest outfit post on Instagram. The star just served up a high-fashion take on Glinda the Good Witch’s signature colour, bubblegum pink.
We’re not sure if Grande’s look was plucked from the film’s costume department, or if it’s just her own stylish homage to the character. But regardless, Grande totally nailed what Glinda’s style is all about. Her gown – designed by Balenciaga’s Demna for the autumn/winter 2023 couture collection – is pink, frothy, and yes, a little over the top. The shredded silhouette, however, makes it less princess-like than your standard Glinda garb (save for the prim little waist bow); it reads way more cool and current.

Complete with her matching satin pumps and shining diamond jewels, Grande’s high-fashion take on Glinda has us even more pumped for the movie. November seems so far away, but luckily, it looks like more Glinda-inspired ensembles are on the way. “We’re going to have so much fun this year,” Grande wrote on her stylist Mimi Cuttrell’s Instagram page. Bring it on.
