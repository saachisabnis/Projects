Dwayne Johnson has heard the rumors about him, and while he says they’re “bullshit,” they aren’t completely wrong. Earlier this year, The Wrap published an exclusive piece about Johnson’s tardiness creating behind-the-scenes tension for the Amazon MGM film Red One, allegedly costing the production company hundreds of thousands of dollars, as well as delaying the release date. These allegations came up during Johnson’s recent cover shoot with GQ, where he admitted that tardiness happens, but insisted that the number that was circulating was “a bananas amount.” 
When asked about his proclivity for urinating in bottles, he responded, “Yeah. That happens,” and although we have a few questions as to why, it’s probably best he doesn’t answer them. 
Meanwhile, Mattel had a wicked blunder over the weekend. Special-edition dolls for Wicked, which feature recreations of Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Jonathan Bailey’s characters in the movie, were intended to include a link to the film’s website on the packaging. Unfortunately, a misprint omitted the word “movie” from the URL, sending a ton of traffic to an adult-entertainment website. The toy manufacturer quickly released a statement saying that they “deeply regret” the error, and are taking immediate action by recalling the dolls from stores.
Over on the timeline, the week is getting started with a new batch of hilarious tweets. Today’s funniest include those about a seating chart a wedding party will never forget, shy chicken and something for the calendarheads out there.
