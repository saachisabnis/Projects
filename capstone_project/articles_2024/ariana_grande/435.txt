Did Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande discuss the Pete Davidson of it all during their recent hangout? Us is dying for details.
“I just came home. Look what we’re watching tonight,” Kim, 44, can be heard saying in a video shared via her Instagram Stories. The clip shows the entrance to her home adorned in Wicked-themed pink floral arrangements, a green carpet and a movie poster.
Grande, 31, and Cynthia Erivo (who play Glinda and Elphaba, respectively) were present for the movie night.
“Look what Cynthia and Ariana set up for us,” Kim said. “I’ve never been more excited.”
In another video filmed in her home cinema, Kim says, “Alright guys, we have a special screening tonight of Wicked,” before panning to an array of Wicked-inspired Barbie dolls “for all the kids.”
Along with Kim and her children — North, Chicago and Psalm West — her mom. Kris Jenner, and sisters Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. Also pictured are several of the next-generation Kardashian-Jenners, including Kourtney’s daughter Penelope, Khloé’s children True and Tatum, and Kylie’s daughter, Stormi Webster.
Kim and company wore special green pajamas and pink socks for the screening. Grande, meanwhile, wore pink pajamas and green socks.
“We laughed, we cried (a few times) and we loved it so much!” Kim captioned a photo, showing off the Wicked crew. “Thank you @arianagrande and @cynthiaerivo for watching @wickedmovie with us tonight. The most magical pajama party.”
Other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family shared photos via social media as well. Kylie, 27, documented the magical movie night via her Instagram Stories, filming herself walking into her sister’s home and saying, “Oh my goodness, this is insane!”
Meanwhile, Kourtney, 45, wrote via her Instagram, “I feel empowered!” over a video of decorative green balloons that were on display at Kim’s house.
“One of the most incredible movies!” Khloé, 40, shared via her own Instagram Stories. Khloe also shared snaps of some of the cool treats the family feasted on: green and pink-colored cocktails, popcorn in Wicked-themed buckets and cakes featuring Grande’s character, Glinda, and Erivo’s character, Elphaba.
While the extravagant decorations are fun, Kim and Grande being in the same room is what seemed to raise fans’ eyebrows. Yes, both ladies have been in relationships with former Saturday Night Live star Davidson — and what Us would give to be a fly on the wall for their stories.

Grande famously got engaged to Davidson in June 2018, weeks after they started dating. By October of that year, they had split. (Grande has since moved on with Wicked costar Ethan Slater.)
Kim, for her part, had more of a slow burn romance with Davidson. The two met when she hosted SNL in October 2021 and started their fling shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, the magic didn’t last. Us confirmed in August 2022 that Kim and Davidson had split.
“There truly wasn’t drama between them when they decided to separate,” a source told Us at the time. “It was something they talked through; it wasn’t a sudden breakup.”
