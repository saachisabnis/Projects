UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- May 10, 2024 -- NBC unveils its 2024 fall schedule highlighting fan-favorite franchise dramas, two nights of laughs, huge unscripted hits and the biggest and best live specials and holiday programming. 
 
Three new series are set to premiere in the fall: Drama "Brilliant Minds," starring Zachary Quinto and inspired by the true story of a revolutionary, larger-than-life neurologist, Oliver Wolf, and his team of interns as they explore the last great frontier  -  the human mind  -  while also grappling with their own relationships and mental health; "St. Denis Medical," which stars Wendi McLendon-Covey, Allison Tolman and David Alan Grier, and is from co-creators Justin Spitzer and Eric Ledgin, brings the laughs with a mockumentary about an underfunded, understaffed Oregon hospital where the dedicated doctors and nurses try their best to treat patients while maintaining their own sanity; and Reba McEntire returns to comedy with multi-camera "Happy's Place," in which her character inherits her father's bar and is less than thrilled to discover that she has a new business partner in the half-sister she never knew she had. 
 
All new series will stream next day on Peacock along with the rest of NBC's entertainment lineup.

SPECIALS / HOLIDAYS 
The 2024 "People's Choice Country Awards" will once again air live from the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville on Thursday, Sept. 26 across NBC and Peacock.  

Last year, NBC's holiday programming reached more than 100 million people across the NBCU portfolio on the strength of an unrivaled lineup of dynamic live events, specials and beloved holiday classics. The festivities continue this season, highlighted by "Defying Gravity: The Curtain Rises on Wicked," a special behind-the-scenes celebration of Universal Pictures' upcoming feature film, led by superstars Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande and the all-star cast of "Wicked" on Nov. 25. 

For the second year in a row, NBC comes to the Opry, now featuring a new master of ceremonies with "Little Big Town's Christmas at the Opry," a festive two-hour music special from the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Join country music superstar group Little Big Town and friends for the holiday celebration of the year featuring performances and surprise special guests at the world-famous stage. 

These lineup additions join annual favorites "Christmas in Rockefeller Center," with returning host Kelly Clarkson, "The National Dog Show" and "Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," which reached a record-setting 40 million viewers as the #1 entertainment telecast of 2023. NBC will also return to Miami for an epic New Year's Eve celebration. 

MIDSEASON 
The network's highly anticipated, 10-part tentpole event series "The Americas" arrives on Feb. 23 with a special two-hour premiere. Narrated by actor, producer, and writer Tom Hanks with music by two-time Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, the natural history series is five years in the making and filled with extraordinary new discoveries. It marks the first time North America and South America, home to the largest variety of life on the planet, are at the center of a wildlife documentary series. The series features many iconic locations in the United States, which viewers and their families will instantly recognize, but experience like they've never seen before.      

Also arriving in 2025 are two new pulse-pounding shows: reality competition series "Destination X," which combines a spectacular adventure with immersive gameplay and the ultimate guessing game, and procedural drama "The Hunting Party" starring Melissa Roxburgh ("Manifest"), which will see a team of investigators attempt to capture the country's most dangerous killers. "Deal or No Deal Island" returns a new set of contestants to the Banker's private island for season two. 

"Saturday Night Live" will mark its milestone 50th anniversary with a celebratory weekend culminating in a live primetime special on Sunday, Feb. 16 from 8-11 p.m. ET.

The 2024 "People's Choice Country Awards" will once again air live from the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville on Thursday, Sept. 26 across NBC and Peacock.  

Last year, NBC's holiday programming reached more than 100 million people across the NBCU portfolio on the strength of an unrivaled lineup of dynamic live events, specials and beloved holiday classics. The festivities continue this season, highlighted by "Defying Gravity: The Curtain Rises on Wicked," a special behind-the-scenes celebration of Universal Pictures' upcoming feature film, led by superstars Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande and the all-star cast of "Wicked" on Nov. 25. 

For the second year in a row, NBC comes to the Opry, now featuring a new master of ceremonies with "Little Big Town's Christmas at the Opry," a festive two-hour music special from the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Join country music superstar group Little Big Town and friends for the holiday celebration of the year featuring performances and surprise special guests at the world-famous stage. 

These lineup additions join annual favorites "Christmas in Rockefeller Center," with returning host Kelly Clarkson, "The National Dog Show" and "Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," which reached a record-setting 40 million viewers as the #1 entertainment telecast of 2023. NBC will also return to Miami for an epic New Year's Eve celebration. 

MIDSEASON 
The network's highly anticipated, 10-part tentpole event series "The Americas" arrives on Feb. 23 with a special two-hour premiere. Narrated by actor, producer, and writer Tom Hanks with music by two-time Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, the natural history series is five years in the making and filled with extraordinary new discoveries. It marks the first time North America and South America, home to the largest variety of life on the planet, are at the center of a wildlife documentary series. The series features many iconic locations in the United States, which viewers and their families will instantly recognize, but experience like they've never seen before.      

Also arriving in 2025 are two new pulse-pounding shows: reality competition series "Destination X," which combines a spectacular adventure with immersive gameplay and the ultimate guessing game, and procedural drama "The Hunting Party" starring Melissa Roxburgh ("Manifest"), which will see a team of investigators attempt to capture the country's most dangerous killers. "Deal or No Deal Island" returns a new set of contestants to the Banker's private island for season two. 

"Saturday Night Live" will mark its milestone 50th anniversary with a celebratory weekend culminating in a live primetime special on Sunday, Feb. 16 from 8-11 p.m. ET.

Marking the first time acclaimed actor, producer and writer Tom Hanks will narrate an unscripted entertainment series, "The Americas" will also feature music by two-time Oscar winner Hans Zimmer. This incomparable project will employ revolutionary filmmaking technology that will showcase the wonders, secrets and fragilities of the Americas - Earth's largest landmass and the only one to stretch between both poles - and reveal extraordinary, untold wildlife stories that deeply connect with millions around the world.  
   
"The Americas" is executive produced by renowned Emmy and BAFTA Award-winning wildlife producer Mike Gunton ("Life," "Planet Earth II," and "Dynasties") for BBC Studios Natural History Unit, the world's largest production unit dedicated to wildlife filmmaking, in association with Universal Television Alternative Studio, a division of Universal Studio Group.   
 
"DESTINATION X" 
Merging fantasy with reality in this larger-than-life adventure competition series, viewers will follow contestants as they embark on the road trip of a lifetime but have no idea of their location. In order to win, they must figure out their mystery locations. Once they're on the blacked-out Destination X bus, the journey transforms into a real-life game board, with challenges designed to offer clever clues as to their location, along with a few misdirects to keep them guessing.   
 
At the end of each episode, the contestant who places an X on a map furthest from the actual location packs their bags. The first participant to reach Destination X will be crowned the winner. With high stakes and mind-blowing, spectacular gameplay, the series will keep viewers engaged and playing along on all screens. 
 
Caroline Davies, Andy Cadman Dan Adamson and David Clews will executive produce. Shireen Abbott and Karen Hudson will oversee production.
