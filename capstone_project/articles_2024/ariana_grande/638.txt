Maika Monroe and her real estate beau Dalton Gomez have taken a significant step in their relationship by going Instagram official, marking a milestone moment for the couple in the realm of social media.
The 31-year-old actress delighted fans by sharing a series of snapshots on her Instagram account on Sunday, June 9, offering a glimpse into her life and her blossoming romance with the 28-year-old Dalton.
In the photos, Maika radiates joy as she poses alongside her dashing beau, their affection palpable in every frame. From sweet kisses to tender embraces, the couple’s chemistry is undeniable, captivating viewers and sparking a wave of admiration from fans worldwide.
Accompanying the heartwarming snapshots is a simple yet meaningful caption adorned with a shining star emoji.
The photographs provide a candid glimpse into the couple’s life, capturing intimate moments shared between two individuals deeply in love. From romantic kisses to cozy cuddles aboard a boat, Maika and Dalton’s Instagram debut offers a touching tribute to their blossoming relationship.
Their journey to Instagram official status began back in October 2023 when rumors of their romance first surfaced after they were spotted locking lips in Los Angeles, igniting speculation about the nature of their relationship.
Just a few weeks ago, Maika and Dalton were spotted at the airport upon their return to Los Angeles, further solidifying their status as a power couple on the rise.
While Maika and Dalton are forging their path forward together, they both carry with them the weight of their past relationships. Maika’s previous romance with Stranger Things’ Joe Keery garnered attention, with Joe recently making comments pertaining to their split.
Similarly, Dalton’s high-profile divorce from Wicked star Ariana Grande made headlines, marking the end of a chapter in his life and opening the door to new beginnings with Maika.
