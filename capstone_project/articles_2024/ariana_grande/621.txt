Ariana Grande is hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend on October 12th, with Stevie Nicks as the musical guest, and we're getting our first glimpse of the episode in a new teaser.
In the video shared to SNL and Ari's social channels, Ariana is in the SNL offices for a pre-show meeting where she shared her one request as host of the show. She politely asked, "Guys, I'm so excited to be hosting this week, but before we start, I just wanna say, I would really prefer to not do anything related to Wicked or Wizard of Oz."
Then, the camera slowly pans over to some of the cast, who are dressed as the Tin Man, Scarecrow, Lion and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, as they all get up and leave to go back to the drawing board, saying, "May we come back in one hour?"
And, of course, Ariana obliged them the extra time.
This could be a hint that the show will feature a Wicked or Wizard of Oz sketch as Wicked is set to hit theaters next month on November 22nd, which sees Grande as Glinda, opposite Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba. 
Check out Ariana's Saturday Night Live teaser below, and tune in this weekend!
