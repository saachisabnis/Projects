DRMAGDN Cyborg Drummer / DJ’s new single, an EDM Pop Anthem called “My Best” featuring powerful singer Morgan Keller, has broken 630,000 streams. The midtempo synthwave inspired song was directly inspired by quotes of woman empowerment that Marilyn Monroe spoke during her iconic life in the public spotlight. With such lyrics like “when I fall down or apart I defy gravity” and “cause those shy or polite girls rarely make history,” DRMAGDN celebrates Marilyn Monroe’s talent, legacy and wisdom with his new track.
DRMAGDN says: “I am a big fan of the life and triple threat talent of the amazing actor, singer and dancer Marilyn Monroe and was inspired by the wisdom she spoke about how she challenged social norms and mused about the ups and downs of being a woman in the spotlight during such a bygone era. I was very surprised just how clearly her wisdom still rings true today, so I created a track that feels like it could be home on a Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez or Ariana Grande record to fit the melodies and truth-bomb lyric that we all can identify with: 'if you can’t take me at my worst, you can’t have My Best.' Shout out to Morgan Keller for the amazing lead vocal and Emily Victoria on the massive backing vocal choir that helps bring Marilyn's powerful legacy and messages to life.”
