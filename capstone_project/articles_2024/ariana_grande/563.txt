	Ariana Grande is Ethan Slater‘s biggest fan.

	The 30-year-old superstar was in the crowd at the St. James Theatre in New York City on Sunday night (April 7) for the final performance of Spamalot, which opened back in November. Grande was spotted by fans leaving the theater, hand in hand with her boyfriend Slater. She was dressed casually in jeans and a brown jacket with her blonde hair in a low bun. In the play, Slater portrays The Historian/Prince Herbert.

	The “Yes, And?” singer also celebrated the show’s successful run on Broadway on her Instagram Stories, writing alongside a photo of the stage: “Congratulations to the most beautiful and talented and kindest cast and crew on a magnificent run.”

	Reports surfaced back in July that Grande is dating her 31-year-old Wicked costar following her recently reported split from husband Dalton Gomez. Both TMZ and People reported that he and Grande started dating after both of their relationships were over. Slater was previously married to singer Lilly Jay, and the two celebrated their four-year wedding anniversary in November 2022.
