That's hot 🔥
Merry Christmas one 'n' all! December 25 brought us lots of laughs, an epic Gavin and Stacey finale and of course, many a gift. Whether it was a clementine in your stocking or an upgraded makeup stash, we hope that Santa delivered. However, if it still feels like you're missing a present, fear not! Paris Hilton is here to provide, having shared a completely naked video on social media to celebrate the festive season... natch.
On Christmas day, alongside a number of family photos, Paris took to Instagram to share a video reel lipsyncing to Ariana Grande's 'Santa Tell Me'. And as mentioned, the Y2K star did so while completely naked, wearing nothing but red leather gloves and a giant Xmas bow to censor.
To caption the video – which, at the time of writing, has amassed over half a million likes – Paris wrote: "My presence is a present 💅🏼🎁🎀 #ThatsHot 🔥 #Slivmas 🎄."
As expected, a number of Paris' 26+ million followers ran to the comments section of said post to share their thoughts. Read a select few of our faves below:
At 43 years old, Paris has now been in the public spotlight for over 30 years. Yes, 30! I mean, she hasn't aged a day! So, we have to agree with the fans above and conclude that this post is "iconic". Mic = drop.
