Metro Boomin has expressed his concern with the music industry’s shift toward a formulaic approach to creating social media ready releases.
Metro recently addressed his frustrations about the current climate of music on Twitter (X). In his sandwich method style tweet, the St. Louis-bred producer coupled his likes and dislikes about the impact of TikTok on artists at-large.
“I love the creativity and appreciation the kids show for the music on TikTok but I don’t like the forced pandering from artists and labels that results in these lifeless and soulless records,” Metro wrote.

Metro Boomin’s comments follow Universal Music Group’s announcement their artists’ music will no longer be available on TikTok after failing to renegotiate their contract with the social media platform. A UMG spokesman told Reuters all of its music will be pulled from TikTok—this would include songs from some of the world’s biggest artists, including Drake, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Eminem, The Beatles, Ariana Grande, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, SZA and many more.  
UMG also accused TikTok of engaging “obvious” tactics to “hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal,” and also claimed TikTok attempted to “intimidate” them during contract negotiations “by selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.”
