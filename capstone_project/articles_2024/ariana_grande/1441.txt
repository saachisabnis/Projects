Someone who attended the show said the opening act hit the stage a little after 7 pm. Then Pete came out for a "hilarious" 50-minute comedy set and then suddenly said good night to the Coronado crowd before running off the stage before 8:30 pm leaving many in the crowd wondering "Is that it?"
The former "Saturday Night Live" star, who has made a name for himself with his raw humor and personal storytelling, announced that he has scrapped eight upcoming gigs over the next three months, leading to a significant shake-up in his tour schedule.

Davidson has checked himself back into a mental health facility following the cancellation of his shows, where he's been on a run of nearly 200 stand-up shows across the country, according to People.
The specifics behind this decision remain undisclosed, and it’s unclear whether his return to rehab is directly linked to the recent show cancellations.
The news of his hiatus comes on the heels of his earlier announcement that he had to cancel performances in Florida and New Jersey, citing scheduling conflicts, according to Daily News.
