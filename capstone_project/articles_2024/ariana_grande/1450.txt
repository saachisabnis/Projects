Comedian Pete Davidson is funny and charming on camera, but his public persona can’t hold a candle to what people imagine he’s like in private. That’s because of his well-earned reputation as a ladies’ man. The former Saturday Night Live cast member has had a lot of famous girlfriends, which attracts a lot of interest from fans.
In an interview with W magazine in December 2024, Davidson shared his thoughts on the attention, saying, “I just want to be known for doing good work. I want to be out there only when it’s movie, stand-up, charity, or business ventures. That’s when I want to be seen. I don’t want to be this fucking loser who just dates people. That’s not who I am.”
When the interviewer objected to Davidson being considered a “loser who dates people,” he replied, “Thank you very much! Because that voice was very loud in my head for a while.”
The star went on to say he’s glad he got to take a step back and consider what he wants to work on from here on out.
“What do you want to be? Who are you?” he asked himself. “I’m someone who is from Staten Island, wanted to do stand-up, and if I got to do anything else because of stand-up, it was a miracle.”
Here’s Pete Davidson’s complete dating history so far.
Girl Code star Carly Aquilino dated Davidson briefly in 2015. She didn’t comment much about it until 2018, when she shared a screenshot she received from a friend that seemed to be in response to Davidson's engagement to Ariana Grande.
“I know I’m the 9 billionth person to text you today about this, but…I can’t,” the Instagram Story read, according to Us Weekly.
One of his longest known relationships was with author Cazzie David, who is also the daughter of comedian Larry David. They dated for two years, and Davidson confirmed their breakup to Complex just after his relationship with Grande came out.
“We’re not together anymore,” Davidson said at the time. “Very talented girl, she’ll be great and she’ll be fine. Yeah, I think she’ll be okay.”
They are supposedly friends again, but David wrote in her book No One Asked for This that Davidson broke up with her right the day before she found out about Grande.
Public interest in Davidson’s love life reached new heights during his relationship with pop star Ariana Grande. They fanned the flames by getting engaged just a few weeks after going public. But five months later, they broke up. Davidson has said the end of their relationship was partly related to the death of Mac Miller, Grande’s ex-boyfriend, which created a lot of stress.
In an interview with Vogue in 2019, Grande said, “I met Pete, and it was an amazing distraction. It was frivolous and fun and insane and highly unrealistic, and I loved him, and I didn’t know him.”
Davidson was first linked to actress Kate Beckinsale after they were allegedly seen flirting at a Golden Globes party early in 2019. Beckinsale is 20 years older than Davidson and has a daughter just three years younger than him. But, supposedly, the real issue was that they were getting too much attention following his split with Grande.
“Even though Kate has been in Hollywood for a long time, she struggled with the attention on her relationship with Pete,” a source said in April 2019. “He lives his life with his heart on his sleeve.”
Davidson and actress Margaret Qualley were first seen together at the Venice Film Festival as Qualley promoted her movie Seberg. But things were over by October, and Qualley recently married producer Jack Antonoff. “They remain friends,” a source told Us at the time of the breakup.
Shortly after he and Qualley split, he was linked to Kaia Gerber, the daughter of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber. The pair broke up in January as Davidson checked into rehab. The next month, Davidson told Charlamagne Tha God in an interview, “She’s very young, and I’m fucking going through a lot, and it was before I went to rehab. It just wasn’t the right place or the right time at all.”
In March of 2021, Davidson began dating Bridgerton actress Phoebe Dynevor. They seemed to be enjoying their relationship and even took some adorable photos together at Wimbledon, but ultimately the issue was distance. Davidson was working in New York on Saturday Night Live, while Dynevor is based in London. They split in August after five months together.
In October 2021, Kim Kardashian appeared as the host of SNL and was cast as Jasmine in a sketch where she kissed Pete Davidson's Aladdin. A spark was there, and they were soon seen together on cute dates in Los Angeles and New York.
By November, they were a couple and dated for nine months. But Davidson had to head to Australia to film a movie, and the distance apparently made it difficult to maintain a relationship. Davidson was also consistently targeted by Kardashian's ex-husband, Kanye West, adding drama to their love life.
Age also played a role in the breakup: “Pete is 28 and Kim is 41—they are just in very different places at the moment,” a source told Page Six. “Pete is totally spontaneous and impulsive and wants her to fly to New York, or wherever he is on a moment’s notice. But Kim has four kids and it isn’t that easy. She needs to focus on the kids.”
Davidson was very briefly linked to Emily Ratajkowski in November 2022. The model was recently divorced from ex-husband Sebastian Bear-McClard. A source told Page Six in December, “Their fling has moved into the friend zone. [That’s] fine with both of them.”
By December, Davidson was dating Bodies, Bodies, Bodies co-star Chase Sui Wonders. They were seen in public for the first time in January sharing some PDA at Universal Studios Hollywood. Early in the summer, Davidson checked himself into rehab again following a car accident. He and Wonders ultimately broke up in August.
A source told Entertainment Tonight that post-breakup, “both of them are focusing on themselves.” Davidson’s mental health issues were part of why they split, the source said: “Pete Davidson has been in rehab and is being treated for mental health issues. He can be manic and wasn’t sleeping well or taking good care of himself, so he decided to go to get help, take a break, and get back on track. Pete is focusing on himself.”
In mid-September, rumors began to circulate that Davidson was dating Outer Banks star Madelyn Cline.
A source confirmed to Us Weekly on September 25 that the couple was dating and that their connection developed fast. “Madelyn and Pete have been dating for several weeks but have grown close fairly quickly,” the source said.
The source added that “[Madelyn and Pete] had hoped to remain low-key for a while, especially because Madelyn is a really private person. But they’ve spent a lot of time together and have built a strong bond in a short period of time.”
But by the summer of 2024, things had come to an end. The U.S. Sun reported the news in July, with a source saying things “fizzled out.”
“They ended things fairly recently, and I understand it was amicable,” the insider added.
In mid-March, Page Six reported that Davidson was dating a “non-celebrity,” identified as model Elsie Hewitt. Hewitt is not exactly unfamiliar with celebrity, however, having been previously linked to Jason Sudeikis, Benny Blanco, and Ryan Phillippe. She also has one million followers on Instagram and has built up a following around food and influencing.
A source told the publication that Hewitt respects the comedian’s “desire for privacy,” adding, “He’s very happy.”
They were then photographed at a Palm Springs resort enjoying some PDA and beachside fun. On March 21, the model seemingly confirmed their relationship with an Instagram Story of Davidson joining her in his bathrobe as she watched Rugrats.
