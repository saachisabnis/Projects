Reba McEntire shared a throwback photo with Melissa Peterman on the set of Reba in the early 2000s, comparing the “dynamic duo” to Elphaba and Glinda in Wicked.
“I guess pink and green really do go with dynamic duos! 🩷💚,” McEntire wrote in her caption on Instagram on Wednesday (November 20). The photo captures the beloved country artist in a green gown and Peterman wearing a pink one in “The Pageant of Grandmas” episode (which also featured an appearance by McEntire’s mother, who passed away in 2020). McEntire and Peterman played unlikely friends on the sitcom, which ran from 2001 to 2007. The real-life friend duo recently reunited onscreen on Happy’s Place, a comedy series that premiered last month.
McEntire’s post arrives days before Wicked: Part 1 releases in theaters. The Jon M. Chu-directed musical film stars Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda. Wicked follows “Elphaba, a misunderstood young woman because of her green skin, and Glinda, a popular girl, become friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz. After an encounter with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads,” its description reads. The movie is set to premiere on Friday (November 22).
