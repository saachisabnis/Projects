If you were watching the Super Bowl, like the rest of the world, you probably saw a few film teasers or trailers. Let’s get into Wicked, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Wicked is the first of two Universal Pictures films directed by Jon M. Chu.
As reported on Shadow and Act, Wicked tells an untold story of the witches of Oz, and stars Erivo as Elphaba, “a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power” and Granda as Glinda, “a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart.” 
The official description of Wicked reads “The two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda’s unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba’s determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.” 
Wicked also stars Michelle Yeoh as “Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible, Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince, Ethan Slater as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student, Marissa Bode as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister and Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz. Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James and Keala Settle round out the cast.” As reported in Shadow and Act.
Expect Wicked to release on Nov. 27 … Hopefully in theaters.
