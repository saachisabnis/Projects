Ariana Grande is saying "Thank U, Next" to the haters who criticized her voice change during a recent podcast appearance on the Podcrushed show hosted by Penn Badgley.
Sitting down for a new episode of the Shut Up Evan podcast with Evan Ross Katz, the 31-year-old singer addressed the viral video in which she is heard switching from a lower, throatier voice into a higher-pitched sound. The actress -- who portrays Glinda in the upcoming Wicked film -- told Katz that switching pitches is "a normal thing people do, especially if you have a large range."
She explained that for so long, she trained her voice to sing and speak at a higher range for the "dream role" that it still sometimes sneaks its way in, even when she isn't exactly expecting it to. 
"I did just spend a long time playing a character every single day," Grande said. "[I trained] my voice to do different things for a long time before leaving for London and before any of this. The voice is in the body, it's an instrument and muscle memory is a real thing."
Furthermore, Grande called the criticism and mockery a double standard, pointing to actors and actresses who go "method" for a role. The term applies to an acting technique in which the actor attempts to become the character they are portraying, both on and off screen. 
"I mean, you see male actors, sure people make jokes here and there as well about everybody who experiences something like this, but it's always after the fact that they're like, 'Oh wow, how dedicated to his craft! What an amazing transformation! He's a brilliant performer!' But then it's like, God forbid I sneeze like Glinda or something," Grande said.
She added, "[Then] it's just that I am crazy [...] it's the weirdest thing."
The podcast host -- a longtime friend of Grande's -- agreed and told skeptical listeners that "both" tones are her real voice and that it all just depends on the time of day, the role or show she's working on, and how intense her vocal regimen is at that time. 
He also added that many people do not have a sense of "vocal literacy" or an understanding of what goes into being a singer. Katz even cited Celine Dion who has similarly opened up about her own careful care of her instrument. In the "My Heart Will Go On" crooner's recent documentary, I Am Celine, she shared that she has to sleep 12 hours a night and avoid alcohol completely to maintain her voice. 
Grande -- who made her Broadway debut in 13 more than a decade and a half ago -- wholeheartedly agreed, saying, "[It's] a full-time commitment and it's a lifestyle; it's not something you can f** around with."
After a video of Grande's appearance on Podcrushed amassed millions of views on TikTok, Grande responded to one reposting of the podcast episode with an explanation.
"habit (speaking like this for two years) and also vocal health :) 🍵 i intentionally change my vocal placement (high/low) often depending on how much singing i'm doing 😭 i've always done this BYE," she wrote in a TikTok comment back in June. 
While she may no longer be singing for Wicked, Grande's voice is still on her mind "24/7" -- especially as she continues to make TV, movie and podcast appearances to promote the upcoming film adaptation. 
Grande is also promoting her latest album, Eternal Sunshine, which released in March. While she tried to remain tight-lipped on her intentions to take the album out on the road, Grande told Katz that she is considering a "mini tour" for her devoted fans. 
"I think it would be a really lovely idea to be able to trickle in some shows in between the two Wicked films. I think there's a version of that that exists," she told Katz. Here's hoping! 
Wicked: Part One releases on Nov. 22, 2024 while Wicked: Part Two is expected on Nov. 26, 2025. The films also Cynthia Erivo, Bridgerton's Jonathan Bailey, Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.
