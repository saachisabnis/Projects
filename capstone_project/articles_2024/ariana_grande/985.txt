The backstory: As Oz citizens celebrate the Wicked Witch of the West’s demise, Glinda the Good Witch reveals a more complicated backstory linked to their university friendship.
That’s not the backstory I was talking about: The famed Broadway musical debuted on the silver screen on Nov. 22 with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Now, after a month of reminders that “silence is golden,” theaters are inviting audiences to join the chorus.
Group singing is good for you: Sure, you’ve been able to belt out “Defying Gravity” in the shower or during your commute alongside the movie’s official soundtrack, but there’s something special to the group singalong experience. Research has found people can feel less stressed and more connected after hitting the high notes together— or at least trying to. “You do not need to be a trained singer or highly talented singer to receive these benefits from group singing,” said Frank Russo, who co-directs the Toronto Metropolitan University’s SingWell Project. “I think what's critical is that everyone has the same collective goals, that we're here to have a good time. We're here to sing together and to enjoy singing together.”
Get tickets: In Los Angeles, there are singalong screenings scheduled at several AMC theaters including The Grove, Del Amo and Universal Cinema through at least Jan. 2. In Orange County, there are also showings at Orange and Huntington Beach Cinemark theaters.
