This is what happens when Eternal Sunshine meets Brat.  🔪
Ariana Grande is the latest addition to Charli XCX's brat pack. Charli just dropped a third (!!!) version of her chart-topping album—this time, full of reimaginations of the original 16 tracks—Brat and it's completely different but also still brat. The highly anticipated remix album features Lorde, Billie Eilish, The 1975, Addison Rae, and Tinashe, among other international acts. Ariana brought her signature flair to "Sympathy is a Knife," which fans originally speculated would feature Taylor Swift, as the track was rumored to be about Charli's connection with her.
The Brat hitmaker opened up to New York Magazine about the original song's meaning, saying, "People are gonna think what they want to think. That song is about me and my feelings and my anxiety and the way my brain creates narratives and stories in my head when I feel insecure and how I don’t want to be in those situations physically when I feel self-doubt."
Complete with Ari-isms—yes, even her infamous Sweetener/Thank U, Next era "yuh" makes an appearance—the new version of the song touches on a few topics from old friendships to misconstrued quotes in the tabloids. That being said! Let's dive into the potential inspirations and meanings of Charli XCX's "Sympathy Is a Knife" remix with Ariana Grande.
Lyrics provided by Genius
[Verse 1: Charli XCX]I-i-i-i-it's a knife when you know they're waitin' for you to chokeIt's a knife when a journalist does a misquoteIt's a knife when a friend is suddenly steppin' on your throatIt's a kn— when they say that you've been doing things you don't-don'tIt's a knife when your old friends hate your new friendsWhen somebody says, "Charli, I think you've totally changed"It's a knife when somebody says they like the old me and not the new meAnd I'm like, "Who the fuck is she?"
Of course, we'll never reeeeally know who these lyrics could be about, whether it's one person or a collection of different experiences Charli has had. But... here are some receipts that could fit, either way.
During an interview with Pitchfork in August 2019, Charli spoke about her experience opening for Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour, saying, "I'm really grateful that she asked me on that tour. But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up onstage and waving to 5-year-olds." She also revealed that the gig made her realize that she never wanted to be an opening act again. Her quotes got misconstrued, and she eventually released a statement clarifying what she meant on social media:
As for the lyrics about old friends and new friends, fans think it could point to Charli's relationship with singer Rina Sawayama, who was featured on her last album Crash. In 2023, Rina seemingly called out The 1975 frontman, Matty Healy, for comments he made on The Adam Friedland Show podcast. 
ICYMI, Charli is engaged to Matty's bandmate, George Daniel, and fans noticed that she and Rina seemingly had a falling out after Charli unfollowed her on Instagram. However, Charli reassured everyone that things are good between her and Rina in a series of tweets, per Billboard. Fans speculate that Charli's new "Sympathy" verse might be inspired by the alleged falling out.
[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]'Cause it's a knife whеn you're finally on top'Cause logically the nеxt step is they wanna see you fall to the bottomIt's a knife when you're finally on top (On top)'Cause logically the next step is they wanna see you fall-fall-fall[Chorus: Charli XCX]I-i-i-i-it's a knife whenIt's a knife when, it's a knife when (When, when)All this sympathy is just a knife when (When)It's a knife when, it's a knife when (When, when)All this sympathy is just a--
In the chorus and pre-chorus, Charli reflects on her success during the Brat era and how it's changed her personal relationships. 
During an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, she opened up about every move of hers being watched and taken out of context, saying, "It's hard. It's hard to be constantly scrutinized for things that you have said. It's hard for your words to be taken out of context and then really kind of feel that you just can't defend yourself because that would open a whole other can of worms."
She then shared that she has empathy for bigger artists, like Ariana, who go through it on a daily basis. "I had heard that Ari wanted to do something and I was like, this is somebody who definitely knows this feeling moreso than me," she said of the Wicked star.[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]It's a knife when you know they're counting on your mistakesIt's a knife when you're so pretty, they think you must be fake (Mm)It's a knife when they dissect your body on the front page (Mm, ooh)It's a knife when they won't believe you, why should you explain? (Yeah)It's a knife when the mean fans hate the nice fansWhen somebody says, "Ari, I think you've totally changed" (No shit)(It's a knife) When somebody says they like the old me and not the new meAnd I'm like, "Who the fuck is she?"
Ariana slams critics throughout her album Eternal Sunshine and continues the momentum on the "Sympathy" remix. From the onset, she addresses those who make comments on her physical appearance—something she's spoken about multiple times this year. 
The "We Can't Be Friends" singer also says it's a knife "when they won't believe you," which could potentially point to the rumors that she broke up Ethan Slater's marriage with his ex-wife, Lilly Jay. 
In a Februrary 2024 interview on The Zach Sang Show, she revealed that although she might want to clear up rumors, there "isn't enough time" to address them all. "I feel like we don’t need to go into any specifics. But of course, there's an insatiable frustration, an inexplicable, hellish feeling with watching people misunderstand the people you love and you," she said.
In September 2024, she echoed a similar sentiment during an interview with Vanity Fair when she came to Ethan's defense. "There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him," she explained. "No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about. There is no one on this earth with a better heart, and that is something that no bullshit tabloid can rewrite in real life."
[Pre-Chorus][Chorus][Outro: Charli XCX & Ariana Grande](All this sympathy is just a knife)All this expectation is a knife(All this sympathy is just a knife)All the things I've said are just a knife(All this sympathy is just a knife)All this expectation is a knife (Mm)(All this sympathy is just a knife)Yeah (Mm)(All this sympathy is just a knife)All this expectation is a knife (Mm, yeah, mm)(All this sympathy is just a knife)All the things I've said are just a knife (Mm, yeah, mm)(All this sympathy is just a knife)All this expectation is a knife-knife-knife-knife-knife (Mm, yeah, mm)
