 It doesn't matter what kind of bachelorette party your bridesmaids are planning for you—an awesome playlist of songs will set the tone for the entire weekend. When picking out songs for your bachelorette party playlist, be sure to mix tunes from different genres and eras. If you're planning an epic girls' night out, then a collection of chart-topping girl power anthems will have your entire bridal party singing along. Or, a low-key night in may call for a more laid-back playlist, or at the very least background music to keep energy levels up.

 From current hits to throwback classics that we all know and love, our playlist spans the decades. Regardless of the theme of your bash, you and your crew will love partying to Jason Derulo's "Want to Want Me," Jessie J and Ariana Grande's "Bang Bang," and Flo Rida's "I Don't Like It, I Love It" all night or weekend long.

Before your bachelorette weekend, ask each attendee to send a list of their favorite dance tunes. Then use Spotify to compile everyone's suggestions into one master playlist.
 These are our picks for the best bachelorette party tunes to get everyone dancing.
