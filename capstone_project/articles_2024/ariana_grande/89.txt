Ariana Grande has released her Eternal Sunshine album and fans have a lot to say about the project.
Eternal Sunshine was released on March 8 and features the lead single "Yes, And?" The song was a success upon its release and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Additionally, the album's second single "We Can't Be Friends (Wait For Your Love)" was released along with the album.
The project was lauded by critics upon its release with many of them highlighting Grande's vulnerability in her songwriting as the album is her first since divorcing her former husband Dalton Gomez.
Eternal Sunshine features 13 tracks and Grande has writing credits on all of the songs. Pop hitmaker Max Martin has production credits as well as Grande. Only one person is featured on the album and it is Grande's grandmother, Nonna, who appears on the closing track "Ordinary Things."
