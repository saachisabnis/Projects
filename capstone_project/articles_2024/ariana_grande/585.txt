When it comes to theaters in the United States later this month, it promises it be not only one of the biggest releases of the year, but it could prove to be one of the biggest movies to hit the big screen in a long time.
It's the film version of the Broadway musical Wicked, which has been in the works now for more than a decade.
The movie is rated PG and stars Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba), Ariana Grande (Galinda), Michelle Yeoh (Madame Morrible), and Jeff Goldblum (Wizard of Oz) and is set in the Land of Oz, largely before Dorothy Gale's arrival from Kansas.
The film is the first of a two-part series and covers the events of the musical's first act, following green-skinned Elphaba's studies at Shiz University and the beginning of her path to ultimately becoming the Wicked Witch of the West, alongside an unlikely friendship with a classmate who later becomes Glinda the Good Witch of the North.
You have a chance to see Wicked free in Sioux Falls, thanks to AARP.
