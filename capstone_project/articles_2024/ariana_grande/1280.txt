The Academy Museum Of Motion Pictures hosted its annual gala on Saturday honoring Paul Mescal, Rita Moreno, and Quentin Tarantino — and raising over $11 million for its museum exhibitions, education initiatives, and public programming. Co-chaired by notable figures like Salma Hayek and Nicole Kidman, attendees included a long list of Hollywood icons, including Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Meg Ryan, and Joaquin Phoenix. Tarantino announced during his acceptance speech for the Luminary Award that he’s donating his first handwritten draft of the script for Pulp Fiction to the Academy museum. Ariana Grande performed classic movie songs to close the event. (THR)
