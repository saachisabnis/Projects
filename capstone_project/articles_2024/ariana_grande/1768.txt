‘Cause I waited, I’ve been waiting forever / Right here for this moment / Between you and I / Everything is happening and it’s just what I imagined / I imagined it would feel like paradise / You know I’d give anything to be the only one / Just look at us, we’re right here where we belong / And it was written ’cause the stars said I was yours...
