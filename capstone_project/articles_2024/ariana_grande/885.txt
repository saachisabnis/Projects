ITV The Chase viewers didn't hold back their frustration at another question about pop star Taylor Swift. Hosted by Bradley Walsh, four new contestants named Andy, Jane, Hannah and Billy geared up to compete against brainy Chaser Darragh Ennis.
Jane was the second to grace the podium, managing to accumulate a tidy £4,000 by answering four questions right. However, controversy arose from one question during her duel with Darragh: "Who was Spotify's most-streamed female artist in 2022?" The possible answers were Olivia Rodrigo, Ariana Grande or Taylor Swift, with the correct answer being Taylor, Chronicle Live reports.
This sparked a flurry of complaints on social media regarding ITVs persistent use of questions featuring Taylor Swift. One unhappily declared: "It's always Taylor Swift #TheChase," while another said gruffly: "#thechase Course it's Taylor Swift." Another simply exclaimed: "TAYLOR SWIFT KLAXON #TheChase."

The Mirror noted that yet another user remarked: "ITV obsession with Taylor Swift klaxon #TheChase," and a similar sentiment echoed from another fan: "I like Taylor Swift but since the Superbowl I've seen more than enough #thechase."
One particularly disgruntled viewer added: "#TheChase Always going to be Taylor swift I knew that and I'm Ancient."
The episode of The Chase would ultimately end in defeat for Darragh, with ITV handing over £8,000 even with a low offer taken. Darragh later took to X himself to defend the choice, writing: "The team would have lost if the low offer wasn't taken. Anyone who thinks the low offer isn't worth considering doesn't understand the game."
