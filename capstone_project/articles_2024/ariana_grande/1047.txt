Hello, and welcome back to another round of cultural suggestions. 
It's been a week of Nobel Prize winners and naked nuns causing havoc in Germany - so a mixed bag. In regards to the former, take a look at our guide to South Korean author Han Kang's works - and maybe pick one up this weekend. 
While summer might be music festival season, Autumn is everything else festival season - from contemporary art at London's Frieze to cinema at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, and onions - yes, onions - at Weimar's annual onion fair. Scroll down for more on those.
In case you missed it, there's also The Essen Light Festival currently underway in Germany, while a new David Hockney exhibition, 'Living in Colour' just opened at London's Halcyon Gallery. 
Yep, there's a lot going on. Here are the highlights. 
'Frieze London' in Regent's Park - and across the city (UK)
One of the world's biggest contemporary art events is happening in London until 13 October, with Frieze returning to Regent's Park for an incredible and exhaustive showcase of new exhibitions alongside its sister fair, 'Frieze Masters'. There's a lot to sift through, with galleries and museums across the city joining in by unveiling fantastic new shows. Highlights include the Opera Gallery's recently opened ‘Orixás: Personal Tales on Portraiture’, the inaugural solo exhibition of São Paulo based artist Gustavo Nazareno. Robbie Williams (not as a CGI monkey) will also be presenting 20 years-worth of his drawings and paintings at the Mint Gallery, while British contemporary artist Alison Wilding shares her sensually-charged abstract sculptures in 'Testing the Objects of Affection' at Alison Jacques Gallery. 
'Art of Palestine: From the River to the Sea' at the P21 Gallery (London, UK)
Over 25 Palestinian artists have participated in this moving new exhibition at the P21 Gallery, in collaboration with the Palestine Museum US. On until 21 December, it documents the culture, heritage and adversity faced by Palestinian people, including works from those that reside in Gaza or have recently evacuated. There will also be a selection of embroidery panels on display from the award-winning Palestinian History Tapestry.
"This exhibition serves as a platform for Palestinian artists to express their experiences, identities, and narratives through art," P21 Gallery states. "Through paintings, sculptures, installations, and other forms of artistic creations, these artists shed light on the rich cultural tapestry and the challenges faced by the Palestinian people."
'Isola Design at Dutch Design Week 2024' (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
The biggest design event in Northern Europe, Dutch Design Week puts a spotlight on over 2,500 designers from around the world across more than 100 locations dotted about the city of Eindhoven. Unlike other design events, this one is more future focused, putting emphasis on experimentation, collaboration, and innovative solutions that encourage impactful change. On until 27 October, there's everything from exhibitions to workshops to seminars, collectively providing an exhilarating insight into the ways in which design can shape our world. 
‘Onion Fair’ (Weimar, Germany) 
Don’t cry, it's only an onion fair! So diverse, these vegetables form the basis of flavour for a plethora of dishes, sometimes starring in soups or Zwiebelkuchen (German onion pie). Some people even use their husks to create intricate decorations. It makes sense, then, that a food festival would be dedicated to them. An annual affair hosted from 11-13 October, the city of Weimar peels away its layers to reveal a melting pot of culture, history, community and, yes, onions. Live music events will take place alongside the opportunity to try local foods and get to know the city’s unique and lively character. 
The Apprentice
Ali Abbasi's controversial Donald Trump origin story has already had the Trump campaign vowing to sue. Now, with a bit more than three weeks before the presidential election, the film is beginning its rollout across European theatres. The question remains, however: Will there be an audience for it? "It will be berated for not being enough of a hit job by some; not political enough considering the current climate by others," writes Euronews Culture critic David Mouriquand, who also said the film "works best as a performance-propelled portrait of so-called American exceptionalism." Read the full review here.
'London Film Festival' (UK) and 'Lumière Festival' (Lyon, France)
Two major film festivals have officially begun, with both London Film Festival and Lumière showcasing some of the best cinematic gems on the 2024 circuit. At London’s in particular, many of our Cannes and Venice favourites are featured, including Bird, Anora, April, Emilia Pérez and The Room Next Door. The 16th edition of Lyon's Lumière Festival is fantastic for discovering both old and new cinema, with a lineup of cult and restored movies alongside retrospectives and documentaries - it's also a must for Isabelle Huppert fans, with the French actress receiving this year's prestigious Lumière Prize. Read our preview here. 
Terrifier 3 
Damien Leone’s super-splattered slasher franchise has gained somewhat of a cult status among horror fans since the first Terrifier was released in 2016, with its demonic miming star - Art the Clown - seen as a modern day Freddy or Jason. The third installment sees him return for some yuletide carnage after regenerating at the end of the sequel, so expect more non-stop and increasingly gruesome murders. In fact, if France’s rare -18 ban on the film is anything to go by, this might be the most disgusting one yet. ‘Tis the season to be gory.
Disclaimer (Apple TV+) 
Alfonso Cuarón’s new seven-part TV series stars Cate Blanchett as Catherine Ravenscrof, a journalist with a dark secret - one that’s threatened to be revealed after she discovers a self-published novel by an unknown author in which she is the main character. An adaptation of Renée Knight’s best-selling book, it’s a textured, stylish and at times frustrating furore of flashbacks that examine trauma, tragedy and the ways in which humans manage their memories to cope. Euronews Culture’s critic David Mouriquand wasn’t a fan, calling it “punishing in the extreme” - but you can always count on Blanchett to be excellent. 
Charli XCX: ‘Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat’
Goodbye Brat Summer, hello Brat Autumn (yadi yadi ya). Fresh off the slime-green success of her recent album, Charli XCX is back with a remixed version, intent on keeping hold of the cultural zeitgeist. The collaborations on it are huge, with everyone from Ariana Grande to Julian Casablancas to Bon Iver to Caroline Polachek and The 1975 taking their turn at reworking the album's original tracks with a new energy. But is it worth listening to - or just another cash grab? Two members of the Euronews Culture team share their takes here.
October Album Anniversaries
Each month, we share our pick of three albums celebrating a major anniversary.

It's the perfect excuse to rediscover (or discover) some musical gems, even if it does make us feel pretty old too. Find out more here.
