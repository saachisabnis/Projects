Ari fought off tough competition from last week's number 1 track, 'Stick Season' by Noah Kahan which dropped two places to Number 3, plus Teddy Swims' huge track 'Lose Control' climbed three places to the Number 2 spot. The hugely trending 'Murder on the Dancefloor' by Sophie Ellis-Bextor which is featured in 'Saltburn', the movie everyone's talking about, climbed up 22 places to Number 5. 
New entries on the chart this week include Sabrina Carpenter's 'Feather', 'Obsession' from Ultra Sonic, 'Kool-Aid' by Bring Me The Horizon, and James Arthur's 'Bitter Sweet Love'.
