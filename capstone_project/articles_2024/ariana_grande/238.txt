I told you I had the feeling Gaga wouldn’t  release an orginal song for Joker, she is too focused on getting that Best Actress award.
Lol. 
The Sunne in Splendour.
I prefer my roses white
"I want you to know, I will love you as long as I breathe"
Paul Atreides
 Lol. 
Yeah, I think Gaga should stop focusing on getting a Best Actress award, she needs to let it flow, the anti campaign is the best estrategy, let the performance speak for itself, otherwise the haters will make fun of her like they did with Bradley Cooper this year.
You mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darlings.
My Ideal Contenders for Best Original Song 2024:
(8 songs in preferred listening order; 40+ new releases seen as of reply; not restricted to official submissions)
– Amala Diamini, Bill K. Kapri, & Jeymes Samuel (“Jeezu” from The Book of Clarence)
– Jeymes Samuel (“Varinia” from The Book of Clarence)
– Josh Lambert, Yvonne Lambert, & Toto Miranda (“The Creatures of Nature” from Sasquatch Sunset)
– Jeymes Samuel (“Nazarene” from The Book of Clarence)
After the RRR win, was delusional in hoping that another Indian song would be nominated. 
Will probably still be that delusional again this year. 
Maybe this can cheer you up?:
– Vishal Dadlani, Rakesh Kumar Pal, & Shekhar Ravjiani (“Dil Banaane Waaleya” from Fighter)
– Fred Avril & Philippe Monthaye (“A Million Miles Away” from Mars Express)
– Stefa Marin Alarcon, Robert Ouyang Rusli, & Julio Torres (“Huele a Fraude” from Problemista)
…and last but certainly not least…
– Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (“Compress/Repress” from Challengers)
Yes, I go this hard.
I appreciate any and all of your thoughts.

 This. It seems to work for Men especially: Denzel Washington, Murphy, DDL, etc…. Everyone adores “the misterious men
A Diane Warren song
A Diane Warren song
When’ll she compose for an animated feature?

The way this thread is totally dead. Ain’t we getting songs this year?
TBD (Gaga & Phoenix?) – Joker: Folie à Deux
Relentless (Diane Warren) – Relentless
TBD – Sing Sing
El Camiño (Selena Gomez) – Emilia Perez
TBD – Moana 2
TBD (Beyoncé) – Mufasa: The Lion King
TBD (Cynthia Erivo and/or Ariana Grande) – Wicked
TBD – Piece By Piece
TBD – The End
Compress/Repress (Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross) – Challengers
I guess we’ll know who are the early top contenders (songs released before Aug. 30) when the Grammys release the submissions list for Best Song Written for Visual Media.
‘Joker 2: Folie à Deux’ Runtime Around 2 Hours 30 Minutes
“The cut shown had 20+ songs featured, four of them were originals. Although there is a duet, most of them are sung by Lady Gaga. In the film, Gaga sings a reworked version of Dinah Washington’s “The Bitter Earth,” with new lyrics, and it’s said to be a major highlight”
Gaga is most likely the frontrunner for song.
EGOT & Triple Crown of Acting winner, VIOLA DAVIS
2-time Oscar winner, EMMA STONE
Emmy & Tony winner, JODIE COMER
Emmy & Olivier winner, SARAH SNOOK
Oscar & Emmy nominee, SEBASTIAN STAN
Is it confirmed that the Relentless song from the Diane Warren doc exists? I’ve read nothing about it from people who have actually seen the movie

I just provided y’all 8.
I’ve seen 30+ more new releases since that comment, and that list of 8 original film songs hasn’t changed.
What’s stopping us from at least keeping the 8 songs I’ve provided as temporary placeholders, to at least give them some chance of growing in people’s minds over the summer and into autumn?
Why can’t it be the challenge of the film songs still on the horizon—the ones way too many Oscars prognosticators lazily predict for months without having heard a single note—to match or surpass the original songs from films that have already come out?

Diane Warren does have an original song for a major film being released this year by a major company. That’s different than some of her nominations recently for smaller budget movies. I was asked not to reveal the exact film or company yet.

there’s a whole speculation about a possible taylor swift connection to that deadpool movie. and she recently worked with diane warren, so maybe this is the case here
