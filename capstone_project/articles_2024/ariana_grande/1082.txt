Sweet, creamy, gourmand scents look set to stay in 2025, with a continued surge in TikTok searches and Google interest in these fragrant delights filled notes of vanilla and caramel that are utterly irresistible.
"Gourmand fragrances have been all the rage for the past couple of years, but the focus is now shifting away from sugary 'dessert' scents towards aromas that remind us of our favourite comfort foods-like tea, coffee, marmalade on toast, and warm nutty pastries," Floral Street's founder Michelle Feeney says.
But far from being saccharine, sickly concoctions more likely to attract wasps than compliments, the latest vanilla perfumes smell grown-up, luxe and sexy – if they're formulated well. "Natural vanilla over synthetic vanilla makes a big difference to the aroma," reveals Michelle, reports the Mirror. "It also really depends on what other ingredients the perfumer has woven together to create the overall perfume."

As someone who adores both vanilla and smoky scents, I was eager to try this, and I wasn't let down; it's utterly addictive. Interestingly, I think the smoke notes come through stronger than the vanilla ones, with distinctive hints of marshmallows toasting on a cosy campfire. I've received numerous compliments on it already, and it's quickly become a staple on my desk, where I'll reach for it to spritz on regularly throughout the day.
While it's a body mist and so not as long-lasting as, say, an eau de toilette or eau de parfum, at £25, I feel the price reflects its value.

Ariana Grande's fragrances have been a hit, even with the most discerning perfume connoisseurs.

I couldn't wait to open this as soon as it arrived; everything about it is simply stunning, from the beautiful packaging to the delightful scent inside. It combines cosy notes of vanilla, musk and condensed milk with strawberry liquor and leather, creating a truly unique fragrance that's powdery yet has a hint of fresh greenness. Plus, it lingers on the skin for quite some time.
"This is a blend of vanilla beans, jasmine, cassis, citrus, bamboo and sandalwood, offering a warm and comforting vanilla aroma with a modern, unexpected twist," shares Michelle. "Its natural vanilla provides a deeper, creamier feel to the fragrance, blended with woody notes, and exudes a comforting and confident scent."
This perfume is as tantalising as its name suggests, crafted with raw ingredients. It features not only the vanilla hinted at in its title, but also notes of cotton candy, frangipane, musk and tonka bean. It's reminiscent of a mouth-watering, Michelin-starred dessert.
The fragrances from Sol de Janeiro's Cheirosa line are generally sweet and caramel-like, but '71 stands out with its strong vanilla notes, paired here with white chocolate, sea salt, coconut blossom and toasted macadamia. It evokes memories of summer, like enjoying ice cream on the beach. If you're uncertain about vanilla scents, a perfume mist is an affordable way to give it a go.
This is a vanilla scent with a rich, woody twist, thanks to notes of amber, mahogany wood and roasted barley. Like many Tom Ford fragrances, it's incredibly seductive, and a little certainly goes a long way.
