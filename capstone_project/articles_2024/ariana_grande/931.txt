Singer and actress Ariana Grande hosted Saturday Night Live just over one month ago, taking the stand up show by storm on October 12 with Stevie Nicks as her musical guest. On Saturday night, one of Grande's most iconic and viral performances made a return, as the singing friend group once again told a story about Kelsey with hilarious lyric changes to a popular song.
In the first skit, Grande and SNL regulars Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, and Sarah Sherman serenade Kelsey at her wedding to an off-key version of "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter. The new lyrics tell the story of meeting mysterious Domingo (Marcello Hernandez) on the bachelorette party, much to the chagrin of the groom.
This time around, we're at a baby shower for Kelsey (Chloe Fineman), and the singers are back again. Charli XCX replaces Grande's character, and the quartet blesses everyone with a remix of Chappell Roan's "HOT TO GO!"
We just got "direct from Domingo" out of our heads. I guess "D-O-M-I-N-G-O!" will happily take it's place.
