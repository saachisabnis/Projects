Woohoo! Saturday Night Live is all new on Saturday, October 12, 2024, and if you're wondering who's hosting and the musical guest as Season 50 (!) continues, you've come to the right place.
That would be Ariana Grande, who continues to be an amazing singer and actress who will star in Wicked. As for musical guest? That would be the incomparable Stevie Nicks, who has been on the show before back in 1983.
There you have it! Enjoy SNL -- it's the third show of this season premiere, in case you didn't know! -- and here's a promo featuring them both making a bunch of funny jokes, as is the tradition leading up to Saturday night's show:
