DSW is dialing up the fashion this fall with a new collaboration with celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell.
Known for her work with Ariana Grande and Gigi Hadid, Cuttrell worked with DSW to curate a collection of this fall’s hottest shoes.
“I worked with DSW on highlighting how to wear a few of my favorite footwear trends for fall, including ballet, animal-themed print, kitten heel and court,” Cuttrell told FN in an interview. “All four trends are versatile from day to date night and everything in between. Ballet flats and kitten heels elevate any outfit but also provide comfort. Animal-themed prints shoes are a great accessory to any outfit and a cool court-style sneaker should always be in rotation.”

The stylist added that some of her favorite styles from her curated selection are from Adidas, Steve Madden, Steven New York and Madden Girl. “The Blanca Foldover bootie with a kitten heel from Steven New York is a staple piece for fall, the Madden Girl Krystal snake print Mary Jane looks great paired with a sleek suit,” she noted. “Sneakers are always great in the fall season. I particularly love the Adidas Grand Court 2.0 Sneaker in black.”

Sarah Crockett, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of DSW, told FN that partnering with Cuttrell gives the retailer’s customers exclusive access to her fashion expertise as they explore how to shop and wear the footwear trends of the season. “By integrating Mimi’s point of view and styling directives in our marketing, our customer receives the same attention as her A-list clients do,” Crockett said. “We are finding ways to continually remind our customers that they truly are VIPs here at DSW.”
DSW’s new tie-up with Cuttrell comes as the footwear retailer continues to collaborate with influential cultural figures. In July, DSW tapped actors and musicians Ashlee Simpson Ross and Evan Ross – and their children – to showcase the back-to-school season’s must-have shoes.
In April, the retailer paired up with “Vanderpump Rules” star Ariana Madix on an exclusive curated collection of shoes for spring.
