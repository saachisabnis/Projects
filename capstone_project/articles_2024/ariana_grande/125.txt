Ariana Grande has shared her perspective on the recent controversy surrounding an edited Wicked movie poster that stirred up strong reactions, especially from her co-star Cynthia Erivo.
Universal Studios recently released a poster for the Wicked film that captures the essence of the original Broadway musical’s iconic artwork, showing Ariana’s character Glinda leaning in to whisper to Cynthia’s Elphaba. However, some fans felt compelled to modify the image using AI, making it more closely resemble the musical’s original design. In this modified version, Cynthia’s face was partially obscured by her character’s hat, which she found deeply upsetting.
When the edited poster surfaced online, Cynthia responded passionately, calling it “the most offensive thing I have seen.” Her reaction sparked discussions across social media about fan edits and the growing use of AI to alter official artwork.
At a recent red-carpet event, Ariana was asked by Variety about her thoughts on the altered poster and Cynthia’s reaction. She responded thoughtfully, acknowledging the challenges and complexities surrounding AI in today’s media landscape. “I think it’s very complicated because I find AI so conflicting and troublesome sometimes, but I think it’s such a massive adjustment period,” Ariana shared. “This is something that… it’s so much bigger than us.”
Ariana also expressed that while she understands fans’ enthusiasm for creating and sharing edits, there is a line that can sometimes be crossed. “The fans are gonna have fun and make their edits,” she noted, showing an understanding of fan culture. However, she added a note of caution: “I have so much respect for my sister Cynthia, and I love her so much.”
As Wicked fans await the movie’s release, this discussion serves as a reminder of the fine line between celebrating beloved characters and staying true to the intentions of the actors and creators bringing them to life. Ariana’s supportive words for Cynthia demonstrate the strong bond between the two stars, a connection that will likely bring depth and magic to their portrayal of Glinda and Elphaba on screen.
