Starbucks is partnering with Universal Pictures on a promotion built around “Wicked,” an origins story about the Wicked Witch of the West in “The Wizard of Oz.”
The coffee chain is serving two cold beverages inspired by the main characters in the movie: Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo, and Glinda, played by Ariana Grande.
Elphaba’s Cold Brew is made with peppermint-flavored syrup, nondairy matcha cold foam and green candy sprinkles, according to Starbucks. Glinda’s Pink Potion is a Mango Dragonfruit Starbucks Refresher topped with nondairy strawberry cold foam and topped with candy sprinkles.
Starbucks is also selling “Wicked” gift cards and will begin selling “Wicked” merchandise, tumblers and cold cups, on Nov. 7, according to a news release.
“Wicked” is based on the long-running Broadway musical with a score by Stephen Schwartz. It opened in 2003. A tour is coming to the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood in December and San Diego Civic Theatre in February.
The movie version has been broken into two parts. Part One will hit movie theaters on Nov. 22, a week before Thanksgiving. Part Two is scheduled to open Nov. 21, 2025.
The director is Jon M. Chu of “Crazy Rich Asians” fame.
