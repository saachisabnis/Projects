Ariana Grande addressed haters who accused her of being fake in a recent interview due to the drastic change in her voice.  Grande was on Penn Badgley's "Podcrushed" podcast, and her voice drastically changed in the middle of the conversation.  As the clip made its rounds on social media, many people accused Ariana of being fake, but the singer says she changed her voice on purpose.  Ariana says she has switched between high and low vocal locations for the past two years, depending on how frequently she sings, to maintain her vocal health. Do you believe Ariana’s reason for her vocal changes? Why or why not?
