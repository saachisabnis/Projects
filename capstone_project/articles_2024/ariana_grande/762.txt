Vienna Eras Tour dates this week had to be cancelled after arrests were made regarding a planned terror attack
There are rising fears from fans that next week’s UK Eras Tour dates may be cancelled after Austrian police made arrests following a thwarted terror attack plot on the Taylor Swift concert as the tour comes to Vienna. It was set to begin tonight, but tickets have all been refunded. With the details of the plot releasing and sounding increasingly harrowing, many are wondering if Taylor Swift will continue with the tour when she’s set to come back to the UK next week for five more dates.
As of the time of publishing, the Taylor Swift UK Eras Tour dates for next week are not cancelled and she is still set to be taking it to Wembley. According to Variety, sources say that tour promoter AEG and Wembley stadium are working with Swift’s team to review the situation and increase security measures.
Taylor Swift is yet to comment on the thwarted terror attack, which was confirmed to be linked to ISIS. Diana Johnson, the UK policing minister, spoke to LBC about how Scotland Yard is investigating intelligence in preparation for the Eras Tour and Taylor Swift arriving back in the UK. “Clearly, the police will be looking at all the intelligence and making decisions, they risk assess every event that happens in this country, and that’s something for the police.”
She also spoke about how there is a provision to invoke Martyn’s law. This law was set up and campaigned for by Figen Murray OBE, the mother of Martyn Hett who was murdered in the horrific 2017 Manchester bombings at an Ariana Grande concert. Johnson explained the law “is about making sure that those venues which could be subject to terrorist attack have in place everything that they need in terms of keeping people safe, and that will be brought forward by the government shortly.”

The Met Police has said there is “nothing of note” to report on the Taylor Swift concerts when the Eras Tour returns to the UK next week, so not cancelled yet. The police also promised updates.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told Sky News this afternoon “I’m sure Vienna has got its own reasons to cancel the Taylor Swift concerts, we’re going to carry on, working closely with police ensuring that the Taylor Swift concerts can take place in London safely.”
The two arrested in Vienna, a 19 year old and a 17 year old, had planned to kill as many people as possible and then themselves. The 17 year old who was arrested had just become employed by the security team working at the venue, and was arrested by police outside the stadium.
Taylor Swift is yet to speak on what has happened in Austria. Just last week, three children were murdered and many more hospitalised in the Southport knife attacks when they attended a Taylor Swift dance class – it’s led to numerous violent, far-right riots. A stalker was arrested in Germany when he attended an Eras Tour date. I can imagine Taylor Swift is absolutely terrified, and whilst the dates of the Eras Tour in the UK are yet to be cancelled – no one could blame her for being too scared or worried to perform.
In 2019, Taylor Swift previously wrote a piece in ELLE, saying an attack at one of her concerts is her biggest fear. “After the Manchester Arena bombing and the [2017] Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months.”
