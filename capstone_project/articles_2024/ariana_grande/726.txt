Ariana Grande is taking fans on a magical journey to Oz with the launch of her highly anticipated r.e.m. beauty x Wicked makeup collection. The 31-year-old pop superstar, who is currently portraying Glinda in the upcoming Wicked movie, has combined her love for beauty and her connection to the iconic musical in this whimsical new range.
After dropping hints earlier in the month, Ariana officially unveiled the full r.e.m. beauty x Wicked collection, revealing everything from the product lineup to pricing and the official release date. Fans can mark their calendars for October 1, when the collection will be available for purchase on the r.e.m. beauty website and later at Ulta.
In interviews with Vogue and Allure, Ariana shared her inspiration behind the collection, discussing how her role as Glinda influenced the makeup line. “I pulled inspiration for the collection from the stage show, the movie, and the books,” she told Vogue. “I wanted it to really feel like part of the world [of the film]. I wanted it to be a means for the fans to feel closer to it than they ever could.”
The collection is packed with magical products that capture the essence of both Glinda and Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo in the film). There’s an ethereal eyeshadow palette filled with pinks and greens, paying homage to the characters’ distinct wardrobes. But that’s not all—fans will also find three lip stains, a pH-adjusting lip oil, and additional beauty products designed to make them feel like they’ve stepped straight into the world of Wicked. Each character even has their own personalized bundle of products, giving fans a chance to channel either Glinda’s bubblegum pink vibe or Elphaba’s emerald power.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the collection is how deeply Ariana connected with the role of Glinda, using beauty as a way to immerse herself in the character. She opened up to Allure about the transformative power of hair and makeup in shaping her portrayal of Glinda. “Beauty really helped me deconstruct that person and find Glinda,” she explained. “It started with going blonde down to my brows.”
Ariana shared the creative process behind perfecting Glinda’s look, which involved a lot of trial and error. “We tried many different eyebrow shades, so many different toner concoctions,” she said. “And so many different wigs because they all tell different stories. I’ll never forget when we finally landed on the perfect combination. Our director, Jon M. Chu, was like, ‘That’s her.’”
The connection between Ariana and Glinda didn’t stop at makeup—Ariana revealed that she and her co-star Cynthia Erivo would even shop in character. “I just wanted to live in the DNA and mindset of the character,” she said. “Now I love the color pink, and it feels like part of me. I think it’s something I’ll be forever intertwined with in a very special way.”
As for the Wicked experience itself, Ariana described it as nothing short of magical. During her chat with Allure, she recounted an emotional moment that came while listening to the soundtrack mixes. “The other week I was visiting my family in Boca and I was up late one night with my headphones on because the mixes had just come in for the soundtrack,” she shared. “I was sitting in my childhood bedroom with the poster across from my bed signed by the original Broadway cast and listening to our mixes of the soundtrack. It was really emotional. I just burst into tears.”
Fans eager to get their hands on the r.e.m. beauty x Wicked collection won’t have to wait much longer. The entire range will drop at midnight ET on October 1, and with Ariana’s dedicated fanbase, it’s likely to sell out quickly. The collection will also be available at Ulta, giving beauty lovers even more chances to snag a piece of this magical collaboration.
In addition to the makeup collection, fans can look forward to seeing Ariana’s portrayal of Glinda in Wicked Part 1, which is set to hit theaters on November 22, 2024. With both the movie and the makeup line generating buzz, it’s clear that Ariana’s journey to Oz is as enchanting as the world of Wicked itself.
