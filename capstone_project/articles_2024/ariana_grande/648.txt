About
Ariana Grande took to Instagram over the weekend in response to the “hateful messages” being sent to “people in my life” following the release of her new album, Eternal Sunshine. She asked fans to stop the hate, saying they were “absolutely doing the polar opposite of what I would ever encourage.”
Grande emphasized that her album’s painful moments were balanced by “deep, sincere love,” saying: “If you cannot hear that, please listen more closely. Thank you.” Eternal Sunshine deals with Grande’s divorce from Dalton Gomez and her subsequent relationship with co-star Ethan Slater.
The album is already Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day in 2024 so far. Grande’s grandmother, Marjorie “Nonna” Grande, has also become the oldest person to chart on Spotify (her vocals appear briefly on a track.)
