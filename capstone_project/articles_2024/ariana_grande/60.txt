Ariana Grande has sparked online backlash by naming notorious serial killer, sex offender, and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered and dismembered seventeen boys and men between 1978 and 1991, as her dream dinner guest, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The pop star made the shocking confession during an appearance on Penn Badgley's "Podcrushed" podcast last week after the Gossip Girl/You actor starred in her recent the boy is mine music video.
"I was infatuated with serial killers when I was younger," Grande admitted. "Years ago, before the Dahmer series, I was in a Q&A with young fans ... With a parent, someone said, 'If you could have dinner with anyone living or dead, who would it be?'"
"And I was like, 'Oh, honey, you’re so cute. Um, mom and dad, is it OK if I give the real answer?' And they were like, 'Sure, what’s the answer?' I was like, 'Jeffrey Dahmer’s pretty fascinating. I think I would have loved to have met him, maybe with a third party or someone involved. But I have questions.' The parents were like, 'We’ll explain it later, sweetheart.'"
Uh ... why share that now? Lots of people have an interest in true crime. Not too many people become "infatuated" with serial killers, especially to the point of inviting a cannibalistic one to dinner. But even if you went through that as a phase, why talk about it now? Ariana Grande hardly needs the clicks, after all.
