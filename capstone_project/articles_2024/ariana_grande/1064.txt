Ariana Grande thinks of London as her "second home".
Ariana Grande likes to think of London as her 'second home'
The 31-year-old pop star was born in Florida, USA and now resides mostly in Los Angeles but feels a connection to the English capital after spending months filming 'Wicked' there.
Speaking during a live stream of the London premiere on the movie's official YouTube channel on Monday (18.11.24), she said: "It feels like my second home just for being here for so long and I love it so, so much.
"I'm just so grateful, it's really full circle It's so overwhelming and the fans are so beautiful too."
The 'Into You' hitmaker stars as Glinda the Good Witch in the film adaptation of the smash-hit Broadway musical - which is the unofficial prequel to 'The Wizard of Oz' - and wore a yellow dress seemingly inspired by her character's outfit from the number 'One Short Day' as seen in the show.

Meanwhile, her British-born co-star Cynthia Erivo - who plays misunderstood green girl Elphaba and eventually becomes the Wicked Witch of the West -  gave a nod to the famous line said by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic as she spoke of bringing the film to her home country.

She said: "There's no place like home! It's definitely a full-circle moment. This is home for me, so bringing it back is really wonderful for me."

It was reported during the filming of 'Wicked' that Ariana had moved into a North London mansion while she worked on the project.

A source told The Sun: "Ariana is renting a stunning house in one of the capital’s most sought-after neighbourhoods.

"But anyone who thinks they might catch a glimpse of her has no chance, as the place she has found is like a fortress.

"The home has private grounds and is well out of reach of other people, so she’ll be able to totally switch off after filming."
