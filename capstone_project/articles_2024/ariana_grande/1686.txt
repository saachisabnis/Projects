HBO’s critically acclaimed series Euphoria is set to commence production on its third season in January 2025, The Hollywood Reporter reports. This news comes nearly three years after the teen drama’s Season 2 finale aired, sparking fan anticipation.
The show’s principal cast members, including Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney, Hunter Schafer, Jacob Elordi, Maude Apatow, and Alexa Demie, are slated to return for the upcoming season. This aligns with HBO CEO and chairman Casey Bloys‘ June statement regarding the return of the “core cast.”
Francesca Orsi, EVP of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films expressed her enthusiasm: “I’m delighted that we’re poised to begin production on Euphoria in January. Our creative partnership with Sam [Levinson, series creator] and this exceptional cast continues to exceed expectations. We’re eager to bring this new season of Euphoria to life for our dedicated audience.”
Euphoria received its Season 3 renewal in February 2022, just before its Season 2 finale. However, the intervening period was marked by controversy and tragedy. In March, HBO refuted claims of toxic or unsafe on-set conditions. August saw series regular Barbie Ferreira announce her departure via Instagram. In 2023, cast member Dominic Fike revealed he nearly lost his role due to being under the influence during several Season 2 scenes. Tragically, in July of the same year, Angus Cloud, who portrayed the gentle Fezco, passed away at 25. It remains unclear whether the new season will incorporate a significant time jump, a possibility Bloys hinted at earlier this year.
“Sam is contemplating moving beyond the high school setting,” the HBO executive stated. “That was the original context and it made sense then. Shifting away from that raises questions about the new setting and timeline. But I believe he’s developed an exciting approach and is currently in the writing process.”
Levinson himself alluded to a major shift for Season 3 in a September 2023 Elle profile of Zendaya. The executive producer envisions the upcoming chapter as a film noir, exploring “the meaning of individual principles in a corrupt world,” all narrated from Rue’s perspective.
