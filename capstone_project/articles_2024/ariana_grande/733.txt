The Detroit Youth Choir is continuing the musical charm offensive it began five years ago on “America’s Got Talent” with the release of a new album, “Equations,” on Friday, Oct. 11.
The 10-song set features songs written and produced by Dustin “D-Slate” Slater and “Buddy” Alexander Brown and was worked on during the past two years — with intensive recording taking place after the DYC returned from a two-week visit to Africa during the spring. The goal of the album, according to executive producer and DYC director Anthony White, is to place the ensemble in a contemporary R&B and hip-hop lane.
“Everybody looks at the Detroit Youth Choir as being, like, a Disney pop youth choir and things like that,” acknowledges White, referencing the six-part docuseries “Choir” that premiered during January on Disney+. “We wanted to change the tone of our music and just turn the title of how our style is a little bit.
“So we hooked up with (Slater and Brown), and I believe this is an album anybody of any age can relate to.”
The DYC’s Center Stage Choir performs one song on “Equations” (“The Real Thing”), while the top-level Prime Time Choirs featured on the rest, including “Mama We Made It,” which features sound bites from the troupe’s “America’s Got Talent” run. And while the DYC is exploring new sounds, White notes that, “we’re still the ‘America’s Got Talent Choir;” it performed on a couple of episodes, including the finale, of the NBC show’s latest season, and at judge Simon Cowell’s behest the DYC will auditioning for “Britain’s Got Talent” in January.
“Equations” is available via all digital streaming services. For more information about the DYC, visit detroityouthchoir.org.
