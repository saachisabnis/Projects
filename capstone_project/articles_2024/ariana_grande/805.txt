The 2024 Olympics have arrived in Paris. Kicking off tonight, the opening ceremony takes place on a (hopefully) poo-free River Seine – the first time the ceremony hasn’t been held in the official stadium. 
With LVMH as one of the event’s main sponsors – involving its brands like Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon, as well as Dior allegedly involved – the opening event is looking like it’ll be très chic and that’s without mentioning the performances by Lady Gaga and Celine Dion. 
If you missed out on the big barge bonanza, here we round up all the must-see fashion from the night. 
Making her entrance on a golden stairway, Mother Monster appeared in a grand ostrich feather coat, singing in French (au naturel). Performing with a troupe of dancers, holding giant pink pouffs rented from French cabaret theatre Le Lido, she revealed a satin corset with matching opera gloves and delicate headpiece – custom couture designed by Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri and milliner Stephen Jones. A quick change at the piano behind to add some a white ostrich feather tail, it was over before it started. 
Created in collaboration with stylist Carine Roitfeld, Berluti is behind the host team’s opening ceremony fits – its equally chic uniform was designed by Pigalle’s Stéphane Ashpool. The 1500 outfits created for both the Olympic and Paralympic athletes feature navy jackets with gradient lapels to mimic the French flag. “These outfits have been designed to invoke pride among the French athletes and coaches and to live up to their ambitions,” the brand says. “By wearing them, the members of Team France will become ambassadors of French savoir-faire, all primed to make a lasting impression during this momentous occasion.” 
We’re sensing a theme here... French singer Aya Nakamura appeared later in the ceremony, also clad in Dior. Drawing inspiration from the brand’s Fall 2024 couture collection, Chiuri combined shorts and a corset to create a dress covered in golden hand-stitched feathers. Paired with gold gladiator sandals – it was a chic nod to the Greek origins of the games. 
After outfitting the Liberian team for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, American-Liberian designer Telfar returned to design the nation’s opening ceremony looks this year. Flagbearers Thelma Davies and Emmanuel Matadi and their fellow Olympians showed up in floor legnth black and white jerseys with mesh sleeves, printed with Telfar’s logo and country name. Give them all Bushwick Birkins to hold their medals. 
Showing off its fashion chops, some of Paris’s upcoming French design talents Kevin Germanier, ASQUIN, Weinsanto, and Vincent Frederic-Colombo’s C.R.E.O.L.E put on a fashion show with Barbara Butch, Piche, and Drag Race France host Nicky Doll – who later performed herself – on the FROW. Featuring faces like Italian fencer and former Dazed cover star Beatrice Maria Vio Grandis, Raya Martigny, and GG Palmer sashaying down the rain-soaked catwalk, it was a fun alternative to the fashion giants that have been dominating at the 2024 games so far. 
While promoting the upcoming Wicked movie in Paris, Ariana Grande took the time to cheer on Team USA at the opening ceremony. Giving Glinda, she opted for a custom Thom Browne look a powder pink gown with matching gloves seemingly referencing a Givenchy number worn by Audrey Hepburn in 1955. Cute, but we hope she’s got a matching brolly. 
Well, sorta kinda! Representing the historic French heroine, a hooded figure appeared riding a mechanical horse – Reneigh, is that you? – up the Seine. The iconic armour was reimagined as a metallic hooded, buckled look that came courtesy of Paris-based genderless brand Jeanne Friot.

Completing the Dior hattrick, thee Celine Dion made her debut after stopping her tour due to her diagnosis with Stiff Person Syndrome in December 2022. Closing the ceremony giving a powerhouse performance of Edith Piaf’s “L’Hymne à l’amour” atop Tour Eiffel, she wore a sparkling gown embellished with 500m of fringing comprising thousands of pearls and silver beads. Keeping it in the family, conductor Scott Price, who accompanied the signer, wore a black tuxedo by Kim Jones for Dior Men’s. Not a dry eye in the house.
