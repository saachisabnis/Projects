Season 17 "gives a level to 'Drag Race' that we haven’t seen yet," new queen Crystal Envy tells EW, while Sam Star teases that "everything is going on all at once" this season.
 The RuPaul's Drag Race season 17 cast of queens has slipped into Mama RuPaul's her-storic lineage on the heels of Nymphia Wind's giant banana peel.

 Joining the season 17 cast are 14 budding drag superstars competing for a $200,000 prize across 90-minute episodes, with many of the prospective winners hailing from famous Drag Race families, including queens related to alums like Trinity The Tuck (season 9, All Stars 4, All Stars 7), Jasmine Kennedie (season 14), Irene Dubois (season 15), Luxx Noir London (season 15), and the infamous Plane Jane (season 16).

 Along for the ride is also the return of both the Untucked after-show and the Rate-a-Queen twist that ruffled a few ostrich feathers thanks to Plane's chaotic voting-based sabotage during the season 16 premiere. As some of the new queens on the Drag Race season 17 cast exclusively tell Entertainment Weekly in a new series of video interviews (premiering Wednesday, Dec. 11 on EW.com), there's also another new twist that's never been seen before on the Main Stage.

MTV
 “Girl, the twists, the tricks, the runways. My God. I went in like, 'I’m going to have the best looks,' and I went in and I’m like, uh, panic. It’s great," new queen Acacia Forgot tells EW. "The twists are twistering, all the way down!"

 Crystal Envy, drag sister of the aforementioned Jasmine, adds that, while the twist is shocking, fans might be even more gagged by the new cast's display on the runway.

 "The looks on this season are some of the most amazing looks I think you guys will ever see on the show," Crystal explains. "They are top-tier designs, looks, and fashions, and it gives a level to Drag Race that we haven’t seen yet. That’s really going to set the bar. There’s some fun twists and turns coming up, some things you might not be expecting, some gags. The game is new, I will say that!"

 RuPaul's Drag Race season 17 premieres Friday, Jan. 3 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on MTV.

MTV
 City: Los Angeles, Calif.Official bio: "This honky-tonk diva puts the country in California. Glitzy, glamorous, and with a penchant for blonde hair, Acacia Forgot has never met a rhinestone she didn’t like. Musically talented, as well as being a singer-songwriter, Acacia plays the guitar, piano, banjo, and ukulele. Will this aspiring country star also become America’s Next Drag Superstar?"

MTV
 City: Seattle, Wash.Official bio: "Arrietty hails from the House of Dubois — her drag mother is none other than Drag Race season 15’s Irene Dubois. Obsessed with the fantasy genre, this uniquely creative queen designs and sews her own outfits, often with a 'futuristic elf' aesthetic. Add in the ability to beat a mean mug when needed, and this talented, twisted queen is ready to go all the way in the competition!"

MTV
 City: Asbury Park, N.J.Official bio: "With looks so polished, it’s hard to believe this makeup artist and drag queen has only been performing for three years. In New Jersey, Crystal swiftly dominated the club scene. Crystal Envy’s name comes as a mixture of their birth name, Chris, and the fact that every outfit she wears is bedazzled and sparkly. This pageant princess commands a club crowd, but can Crystal hold that same command over the judges this season?"

MTV
 City: Chattanooga, Tenn.Official bio: "This Southern bubblegum babe was infamously plucked from the crowd by RuPaul on the Atlanta stop of his The House of Hidden Meanings book tour and invited to Hollywood. Now officially a part of the season 17 cast, this campy queen — inspired by Disney princesses and vintage screen sirens — hopes to catch the eye of RuPaul again, this time where it counts the most: on the Main Stage of RuPaul’s Drag Race!"

MTV
 City: Tampa, Fla.Official bio: "Out of drag, this youthful queen has a sweetness and an innocence, and is a self-described 'ditzy, clumsy bimbo.' But, don’t be fooled, Jewels intends to enter the competition with intention and strategy. With influences that range from Ariana Grande to Priscilla Presley, to her Puerto Rican and Cuban heritage, you’d be foolish to underestimate this talented doll as merely a 'look queen.'"

MTV
 City: Los Angeles, Calif.Official bio: "Joella calls herself 'The Slaysian Diva,' and with her own unique style of drag, mixing traditional Chinese costume with street fashion and pop culture, you can see why. Having already won local West Hollywood drag bar contests, Joella is now ready to represent plus-size queens in the biggest drag competition in the world."

MTV
 City: Boston, Mass.Official bio: "This boisterous queen has rapidly risen to the top of the Boston scene, amassing a respectable TikTok following along the way. Only in the drag game for 2 years, Kori has already been awarded Boston’s Best New Performer to Watch award, and is the name on everybody's lips. She is season 16 finalist Plane Jane’s drag sister, so expect a razor-sharp wit, and somebody who tells it like it is!"

MTV
 City: New York, N.Y.Official bio: "Lana’s drag mother is Luxx Noir London, from season 15 of Drag Race, so expect a level of fierceness from this fashionista! Luxx saw Lana competing in a New York drag competition and was so impressed, she approached her backstage and asked if she could adopt her on the spot. Bringing legs and body to the Main Stage, Lana is ready to strut away from this competition with a crown!"

MTV
 City: Louisville, Ky.Official bio: "Lexi Love is a full-time playmate at Play, Louisville, a bar known for its high-energy drag excellence. As a performer, Lexi knows how to turn the party up, but she’s also someone you’d love to kick it with. Having survived a period of homelessness and drug addiction, she has emerged a stronger and more independent queen, and is ready for the rebirth of Lexi to take over the world!"

MTV
 City: Miami, Fla.Official bio: "Born in Havana, Cuba, Lucky Starzzz is an expressive, colorful, living cartoon! Lucky’s drag meets at the intersection of club kid and camp, and this resourceful queen uses as much paper and spray paint as she does sequins and rhinestones. Lucky describes her drag as 'a Venus Fly Trap in a room full of roses.' Can Lucky’s eye-catching creativity catch the eyes of the judges this season and win her the crown?"

MTV
 City: Pittsburgh, Pa.Official bio: "To understand this absurdist, unique queen you only need to know that the 'B' stands for butthole. Named after Winona Ryder’s character in Beetlejuice, Lydia Deetz, and inspired by Tim Burton, John Waters, and David Lynch, Lydia B Kollins is a queen who values creativity over perfection. Will the judges find Lydia’s looks BOOTYful, or will her time on Drag Race be a disASSter?"

MTV
 City: Cleveland, OhioOfficial bio: "Smashburger cook by day, enchanting and in-demand drag artist by night, Onya Nurve got bitten by the performance bug in high school, and took an artistic career path to drag via a BFA in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art. A comedic actress as well as being able to belt out a tune, Onya represents a real threat in this competition!"

MTV
 City: Leeds, Ala.Official bio: "Stunning, stylish, Southern! Sam is quite the renaissance queen, having trained in musical theater, and being a retired gymnast/cheerleader who can do back handsprings! With polished makeup skills and a gorgeous mug, Sam has gone on to win an impressive number of pageant titles for such a young queen. It’s no surprise to learn that Trinity The Tuck is her drag mother and mentor."

MTV
 City: Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.Official bio: "Suzie’s uniqueness is her greatest strength in drag. A professional tap dancer with a look rooted deeply in 1920s and '30s fashions, Suzie describes herself as the 'cross section between Betty Boop and Lucille Ball.' A skilled actor with a wild sense of humor and excellent comedic timing, Suzie hopes to wow the judges with her quirky take on drag!"
