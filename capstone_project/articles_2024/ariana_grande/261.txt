Nicola Peltz Beckham attended a Cloud23 launch party held at Bar Marmont yesterday in Los Angeles. Nicola attended the event with her husband Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. 
Towering above the crowd, the “Transformers 4” star donned a pair of lofty platform heels in black. The sky-high shoe choice included thick platform soles, sharp pointed toes and glossy black leather uppers. Dainty thin straps wrapped around the thespian’s ankles, threaded through adjustable buckle closures. What looked to be 4 to 5-inch block heels finished off the set, offering even more height.

 









Brands like Valentino, Versace, Jimmy Choo, Gianvito Rossi and Saint Laurent all make styles comparable to Nicola’s own. Paired with sheer black tights, the footwear choice created dimension, effectively lengthening Nicola’s silhouette. This height-boosting trick is utilized by a myriad of vertically challenged celebs including Ariana Grande, Florence Pugh and Sabrina Carpenter.
