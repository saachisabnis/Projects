Cube Critics got Glicked this week, catching “Wicked” and “Gladiator II.”
“Wicked” is the winter blockbuster everyone’s been anticipating. It’s a vibrant adaptation of the Broadway musical (itself loosely based on a book), telling the story of a young witch finding herself in the Land of Oz. 
The film is led by the incredible Cynthia Erivo, who carries the movie with a stunning performance, and Ariana Grande, whose presence adds sparkle. The supporting cast shines too, with Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh as a cunning puppet master, and Jeff Goldblum as an entertaining Wizard.
“Gladiator II,” meanwhile, pales in comparison to its predecessor. While the performances are strong — Paul Mescal gives a solid lead turn, Pedro Pascal is intriguingly ambiguous and Denzel Washington steals the show as a villain — it struggles with plot depth. 
Mescal’s character feels underdeveloped, often merely reacting to action scenes, while Denzel electrifies every moment he’s on screen but doesn’t get enough interaction with Mescal to elevate the story. “Gladiator II” is worth a watch if you have time, but if you must choose, “Wicked” wins by a landslide. Both films are now playing in theaters.
