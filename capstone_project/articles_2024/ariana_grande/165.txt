Ariana Grande is setting the record straight on whether or not she has gone under the knife â€” while also revealing which cosmetic procedure she is "open" to getting in the future.
The "We Can't Be Friends" singer and her Wicked co-star Cynthia Erivo put their truth to the test in a Vanity Fair lie detector video published Monday (September 30), covering such topics like whether the moon landing was faked, if Grande always loves her fans, and how she always has "resting constant fret" face. 
At one point in the lie detector test, as Grande was hooked up to the machine to determine if she was telling the truth, Erivo asked if she had ever had "any work done to make yourself feel more popular?"
Grande quickly replied "thank goodness" because she appreciated the opportunity to address that she has had any surgical procedures, shutting down questions of whether she's had a "boob job," had her "nose done" or even had a chin implant." The only enhancements she admitted to were getting Botox and fillers "in various places" but said she stopped doing so around four years ago.
"This is the best day of my life. Take that you YouTube people!" Grande quipped, adding that she has nothing but "full support" for people who do choose to go under the knife.
The 31-year-old singer did admit, however, that she would be "open" to getting a face lift in the future, saying "not yet" when Erivo asked if she has had that done.
