Your ultimate guide to seeing RAYE, Sabrina Carpenter and David Guetta all in one place this weekend
The next few weeks at Wembley are set to be huge. Two weeks from now Taylor Swift will be bringing her record-breaking Eras Tour to the stadium, with hundreds of thousands of fans expected to attend across three nights. But before that is another feast of pop music:Â Capitalâ€™s annual Summertime Ball will be taking over Englandâ€™s national football stadium in northwest London for one day only.
The mini-festival, which was first held by the radio station in 2009, has seen many huge stars headline since its inception. Pretty much everyone who had a number 1 hit in the 2010s has attended at least once, including megastars like One Direction (still sorely missed by many), Ariana Grande, and even Ms Swift herself.

This year, the Ball is set to play host to 15 talented artists, all in one day. From Aitch to Time Out cover starÂ RAYE, thereâ€™s enough variety to have something for everyone.
Planning on going along? Hereâ€™s absolutely everything you could possibly need to know about this yearâ€™s Capital Summertime Ball.Â 
Capitalâ€™s 2024 Ball is taking place on Sunday June 16 in Wembley Stadium.Â 
Since the event takes place in Wembley, thereâ€™s only one stage. We donâ€™t have set times yet, but hereâ€™s a list of all the artists whoÂ will be playing at theÂ gig this weekend:
Unfortunately, tickets are sold out. However,Â Capital sometimes gives away tickets on their radio stations in the lead-up to the ball, so if youâ€™re really desperate make sure youâ€™ve got Capital FM on in the background throughout the day.Â 
Doors open at 1pm, but no one will be onstage until 3pm. The event will then go on until around 9.30pm and thereâ€™s no last entry before that time. However, Capital does say that times are subject to change, so make sure toÂ arrive in plenty of time to avoid missing your faves.Â 
At the moment, itâ€™s actually set to be a fairly nice day on Sunday (touch wood). With highs of 20C and lows of 12C, no rain and sunny spells, it could turn out to be a really quite nice afternoon. Of course this is the UK, so thereâ€™s no guaranteeing this wonâ€™t change before, or even on, Sunday, so make sure to keep checkingÂ for the most up to date forecasts here.
