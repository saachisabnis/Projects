Good morning. I‚Äôm Zachary Tracer, senior editor for business & policy at STAT, a health website affiliated with the Globe. Today I‚Äôm a guest writer for Starting Point, explaining what you need to know about insurance giant UnitedHealth Group and the killing of a top executive. But first:
The shocking killing of a top health insurance executive is focusing attention on UnitedHealth Group, the largest health care conglomerate in the US. Brian Thompson, the 50-year-old CEO of UnitedHealth‚Äôs insurance division, was shot and killed by an unknown attacker early Wednesday morning as he walked to an investor meeting in New York City.
New York police have not named a suspect or shared a motive, but they did say the attack was targeted. On Thursday, police sources reportedly said that bullet casings found at the scene had the words ‚Äúdeny,‚Äù ‚Äúdefend‚Äù and ‚Äúdepose‚Äù written on them. Those words could reference barriers some health insurers erect to avoid paying for medical care, suggesting that the murder was connected to Thompson‚Äôs work. They could, of course, hold other meanings, or be unrelated to a motive for the shooting.
As the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Thompson led a business that provides health insurance for more than 50 million people, and is on track to generate $300 billion in revenue this year. UnitedHealth is the biggest provider of private Medicare plans (a business known as Medicare Advantage), and is a major player in nearly every kind of health insurance, from Medicaid plans for people with low incomes to employer coverage. Thompson took home $9.1 million in 2023, a figure that includes his salary and bonus, as well as the actual realized gains of his stock.

Health insurers like UnitedHealthcare generate income in many ways, such as by charging fees to process claims or negotiating discounted care. But one source of profit comes from paying out less for medical care than they receive in insurance premiums from customers. UnitedHealthcare, for example, spends about 85 cents of every premium dollar on its members‚Äô medical care. The rest goes toward running the company or turns into profit.

Some of the money that UnitedHealthcare spends on care winds up back in the parent company‚Äôs coffers. UnitedHealth Group has amassed the largest collection of physicians in the US under its Optum brand, more than 90,000 in all. A recent STAT investigation revealed how the company presses those doctors to act in ways that boost its profit, such as by identifying more health problems in patients, even if those conditions sometimes seemed questionable. And it found that UnitedHealthcare often pays these Optum medical groups more than unaffiliated clinicians.
The strategies UnitedHealthcare and other insurers use to deny coverage or delay medical care and increase profits can infuriate patients, even after the 2010 Affordable Care Act transformed the industry in ways that made comprehensive coverage available to millions more people.
UnitedHealthcare doesn‚Äôt disclose how frequently it denies claims, or uses tactics such as requiring prior authorization for certain services such as hospital stays or surgeries. Federal data show that insurers operating in the markets created by the Affordable Care Act denied about 17 percent of claims. In Medicare Advantage, insurers denied 7.4 percent of prior authorization requests on average; in contrast, UnitedHealth initially denies about 9 percent, according to an analysis from KFF.

UnitedHealth‚Äôs Medicare Advantage business has faced scrutiny from the government, whistleblowers, and patients. The company is facing a Department of Justice lawsuit that alleges medical coding fraud within its Medicare Advantage operations and a patient lawsuit over its use of artificial intelligence to deny care for older adults, which was the subject of a yearlong STAT investigation. Other health insurers are also facing suits over care denials.
Citing STAT‚Äôs work, a Senate report released in October found that major for-profit Medicare Advantage insurers like UnitedHealth were increasingly refusing to pay for rehabilitative care for seniors in places like nursing homes and rehab hospitals.
‚ÄúYou can maximize your profitability if you‚Äôre able to get people out of expensive care settings as quickly as you possibly can,‚Äù one investment analyst told STAT last year.
Even as police work to identify a suspect and motive for Thompson‚Äôs slaying, the attack has prompted fresh reflection on the broken US health care system.
Related: The suspect made stops before and after the shooting, and police are examining a cell phone, water bottle, and protein bar wrapper for connections to the suspect. Follow updates here.

Meanwhile, president-elect Donald Trump announced more than a dozen nominations and appointments yesterday, according to Axios:
Paul Atkins, SEC chair. Atkins is a staunch crypto advocate who has a long history of supporting the industry.
Billy Long, IRS commissioner. The former Missouri congressman‚Äôs mission will be to downsize an agency that Trump wants to spend less time auditing people.
Gail Slater, assistant AG for the antitrust division. Slater was a key adviser to vice president-elect JD Vance, whose deep criticism of Big Tech may show its hand in Slater‚Äôs approach to (potentially) blocking mergers.

Even though the IRS has collected nearly $1.3 billion in overdue taxes from wealthy households due to new enforcement efforts, Trump‚Äôs pick to head the agency likely means those efforts will stop. (CNN)
