Lady Gaga has entered the 2024 Super Bowl discourse. The seminal pop star made her athletic allegiance known while strutting into Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium on February 11 wearing an oversized red No. 16 Joe Montana jersey underneath a bedazzled San Francisco 49ers varsity jacket. She paired her NFL paraphernalia with sheer stockings and signature black sky-high platform booties.

It’s unclear whether Lady Gaga is a noted 49ers fan, but she is football royalty, having played the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show to overwhelming acclaim. The 12-minute set was memorably chock-full of acrobatic feats, pop music nostalgia, and a brand of theatricality not typically associated with the NFL. It was everything Little Monsters wanted and more. Clad in a sparkly silver outfit, Gaga performed several of her biggest hits, including “Bad Romance,” “Just Dance,” “Poker Face,” and “Telephone.”
As for the other stars at this year’s Super Bowl, we’ve already seen Kelly Clarkson, Brittany Mahomes. Taylor Swift, who arrived with Blake Lively and Ice Spice, Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, Hailey and Justin Bieber, and more. And that list will only grow once Usher takes the stage for the anticipated halftime show.
