Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” adds a record-extending 18th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart (dated Jan. 6, 2024). The Yuletide classic, from 1994, also tops the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart for a record-tying 13th week.

	Not only are the entire top 10 of both tallies adorned with festive songs, but the top 19 titles on the Global 200 are holiday tracks, while the full top 20 on Global Excl. U.S. are seasonal songs. Those totals mark the most holiday hits from the summit on down since the surveys began in 2020; previously, the Global 200’s top 10 and the Global Excl. U.S. chart’s top seven songs were all-holiday on the rankings dated a year ago this week (Jan. 7, 2023).

	










	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts’ calculations.

Carey Wraps Up ‘Christmas’ Season Atop Global 200

	Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” leads the Global 200 for a fifth consecutive week, with 159 million streams (up 38%) – the song’s biggest global streaming week since the chart began – and 13,000 sold (up 9%) worldwide in the Dec. 22-28 tracking week (thus, encompassing four days leading up to and including Christmas Day).

	The song spends a record-extending 18th week at No. 1 on the Global 200, following four frames in both the 2020 and 2021 holiday seasons and five frames over last year’s holidays.

	The rest of the Global 200’s top five remains in place from a week earlier: Wham!’s “Last Christmas” at its No. 2 high; Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” at No. 3, after reaching No. 2 last holiday season; Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” at its No. 4 best; and Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me” at its No. 5 peak.

	










	Seasonal songs light up the top 19 spots on the Global 200, with Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” breaking up the holiday party at No. 20. The song, which hit No. 2 in early December, drew 45.3 million streams (down 4%) and sold 10,000 (down 3%) worldwide in the tracking week.

Carey’s ‘Christmas’ Ties Global Excl. U.S. No. 1 Record

	Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” concurrently tops the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart for a fifth week in a row, with 109.5 million streams (up 52%) and 6,000 sold (up 23%) outside the U.S. Dec. 22-28. The song tallies a record-tying 13th total week at No. 1, following one in the 2020 holiday season, three weeks the next year and four last season. It matches the 13-week reigns of Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” in 2023 and Harry Styles’ “As It Was” in 2022. (All three songs are on Columbia Records – Carey’s on Columbia/Legacy, Cyrus’ on Smiley Miley/Columbia and Styles’ on Erskine/Columbia.)

	Wham!’s “Last Christmas” holds at its No. 2 Global Excl. U.S. high; Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” keeps at its No. 3 peak; Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me” dashes to a new No. 4 best, from No. 6; and Michael Bublé’s “It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas” repeats at No. 5, after reaching No. 4 last holiday season.

	The entire top 20 on the Global Excl. U.S. chart consists of holiday songs, with Tate McRae’s “Greedy” the top nonseasonal song on the survey at No. 21. The track, which led the list for a week in early December, drew 35.4 million streams (down 8%) and sold 1,000 (down 4%) outside the U.S. in the tracking week.

	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Jan. 6, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Jan. 3, a day later than usual due to the New Year’s Day holiday Jan. 1).
