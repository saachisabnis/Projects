Ariana Grande is not being managed by Scooter Braun for music or movies.
Scooter — who’s actually been doing a great job with his Nova Music Fest remembrance events — announced this on Instagram.
Ariana is actually managed by Brandon Creed. She left Scooter last year.
But Braun says he’s helping her with with a Korean platform called Weverse, which Hybe — the corporation he runs in the US — owns. He’s also working with her on a cosmetic line called REM, which is not connected to the legendary rock group.
Clearly, Ariana must be invested in these two projects, so I guess Braun wanted remind us of that. For everything in her actual career, it’s Brandon Creed. 
Ariana just had a new album, “Eternal Sunshine,” which was not much of a hit. She will appear this winter in part 1 of “Wicked,” the movie of the musical, and part 2 after that.
