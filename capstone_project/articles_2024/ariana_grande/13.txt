Stevie Nicks returned this weekend for her second appearance on Saturday Night Live, four decades after her initial performance in 1983. Nicks performed two songs, "The Lighthouse" and "Edge of Seventeen" as the musical guest for host Ariana Grande.
Fans of pop star Taylor Swift noticed a nod to the 14-time Grammy winner as Nicks wore a bracelet for Swift's most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department. Nicks has a strong relationship with Swift, with the duo maintaining a friendship that has lasted over 10 years.
Swift mentioned Nicks in her Tortured Poets song "Clara Bow" and performed the song live when the former Fleetwood Mac singer was in attendance at her Eras Tour show in Dublin back in June.
