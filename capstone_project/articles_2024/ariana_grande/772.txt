Ariana Grande is finally addressing her relationship with Wicked co-star Ethan Slater, as well as the intense public scrutiny they’ve faced since their romance became public.
For those unfamiliar with the backstory, Ariana and Ethan met on the set of Wicked, where Ariana is portraying Glinda and Ethan, previously known for his role as SpongeBob SquarePants on Broadway, is playing Boq. At the time, Ethan had been married to his wife, Lilly Jay, for four years, though the couple had been together for nearly a decade. Meanwhile, Ariana had separated from her then-husband, Dalton Gomez, earlier in 2023. When news of Ariana and Ethan’s relationship broke, it sparked rumors about potential overlap between their breakups and new romance, fueling public speculation.
After the news went public, Ethan filed for divorce from Lilly Jay, further intensifying tabloid interest and stirring up more rumors. Questions about the timeline of their relationship and accusations of infidelity started swirling, with many assuming the worst. Now, Ariana is addressing these rumors head-on.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, Ariana opened up about the personal challenges she faced during the filming of Wicked. Reflecting on the whirlwind of media attention, she said, “Of course, I went through a lot of life changes during the filming of this movie. A lot of people that were working on it did. We were away for two years. So, of course, I understand why it was a field day for the tabloids to sort of create something that paid their bills.”
She didn’t shy away from addressing the rumors about her relationship with Ethan, expressing disappointment in how the narrative unfolded. “The most disappointing part was to see so many people believe the worst version of it. That was definitely a tough ride,” Ariana admitted, shedding light on the toll it took on her.
The article also touched on the widespread portrayal of Ethan as someone who left his wife and baby for a pop star. In defense of her boyfriend, Ariana fiercely shot down those claims. “There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she said, standing by Ethan. Although she refused to delve into certain details, Ariana made it clear that the public perception was far from the truth.
Speaking further about Ethan’s character, she praised him, saying, “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about. There is no one on this earth with a better heart, and that is something that no bullsh-t tabloid can rewrite in real life.”
Ariana also took the opportunity to reflect on how the tabloids have impacted her over the years, sharing the emotional toll of being under constant media scrutiny. “Honestly, it’s taken me a lot of hard work to be able to last this long and to heal certain parts of my relationship to fame and to what I do because of these tabloids that have been trying to destroy me since I was 19 years old.”
But despite the challenges, Ariana remained resolute, saying, “You know what? I’m 31 years old and I’m not a perfect person, but I am definitely deeply good, and I’m proud of who I’m becoming.”
With these comments, Ariana made it clear that while her relationship with Ethan has been the subject of public judgment, she’s determined to rise above the noise, defend her partner, and focus on her own growth.
