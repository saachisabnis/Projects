We’re rolling out the red carpet for the most endearing and devoted pet-loving celebrities.
The love for pets is universal, and especially appreciated as we celebrate on National Dog Day on Monday (August 26). Ariana Grande, Megan Thee Stallion, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, Kelsea Ballerini, Miley Cyrus, Miranda Lambert, Nick Jonas and many others have shared adorable photos with their dogs over the years. Some iHeartRadio personalities — including Ryan Seacrest and Bobby Bones — have also shared the spotlight with their beloved four-legged family members.
iHeartRadio even launched a new station specifically for your pets earlier this year. Pet Radio aims to keep dogs and other animals calm while you’re away at work, school, running errands or anywhere else. Some studies have even shown the benefits of playing music for dogs, including the relaxing effect of classical music compared with other genres. To access Pet Radio, you can visit the free iHeartRadio app or ask Alexa to “Play Pet Radio on iHeartRadio.” The iHeartRadio app is also available on your smart TV.
