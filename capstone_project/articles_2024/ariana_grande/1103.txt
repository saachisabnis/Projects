Kotb’s pumps for the Ralph Lauren Team USA celebration were crafted with patent leather material, and featured a triangular toe box in the upper. While the back of her shoes couldn’t be seen from the back completely, based on her preferences for tall shoes, it’s likely the heel measured somewhere between 4-to-5 inches in height.
As for the rest of her outfit, the popular host wore a sleeveless beige tank from Ralph Lauren, and a pair of cream palazzo pants that offered a loose-but-still tapered style. Wearing her hair in her signature side part, she kept her makeup minimal, with a red lip as the standout. As for her accessories, those were kept simple as well, with a couple of gold bangles on her wrist.
Her shoes were in-line with a pair worn on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in January 2023, in which she sported black pointed-toe ankle boots with a deconstructed look, a silver clasp and a stiletto heel measuring between 3-to-4 inches in height.
