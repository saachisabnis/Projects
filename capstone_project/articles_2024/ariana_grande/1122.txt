1️⃣ Super-polluters: A cutting-edge satellite is zooming around Earth 15 times a day, hunting for leaks of methane — an invisible gas that’s dramatically warming the planet. New images show where some of the biggest offenders are.
2️⃣ Cold turkey: At a Thanksgiving gathering 30 years ago, CNN’s David Allan stopped eating meat. While he still believes vegetarianism is the right choice for him, he’s made some unexpected discoveries about himself, others and the world.

5️⃣ Going international: Greenland is about to get a lot less remote. A new airport is opening in its capital, making it easier to get to. Before visiting, tourists should know they’re not in for a standard experience.
