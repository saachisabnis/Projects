Chu shared the news on X, writing, “5. DAYS. EARLIER!!!! Let’s goooo!!”
The film’s stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who play Elphaba and Glinda, respectively, also shared the news on their Instagram Stories.
This isn’t the first time that the upcoming, highly-anticipated musical film adaptation is getting a new release date.
