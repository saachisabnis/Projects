If you are a fan of true crime, and are looking for some new documentaries to stream on demand, there may be no better place to look than Philo. After the massive success of ID Network’s “Quiet on Set” docuseries about the dark side of kids TV and the abuse child actors faced on the sets of popular Nickelodeon TV shows, we’ve updated our list of true crime documentaries that have recently aired and are now streaming on Philo. You can watch them all right now when you sign up for a seven-day free trial.
Here are some of the best-rated and most-watched true crime documentaries from channels like Lifetime, Oxygen, Crime + Investigation, Investigation Discovery and others. All feature tales of high-profile murders, serial killers, kidnappings and other criminal cases available streaming on demand right now with Philo.
• As outlined above, the four-part Investigation Discovery documentary series titled, “Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV” has made headlines all over the world with details about the work environment created by producer Dan Schneider on the sets of his Nickelodeon shows. The series also profiles the experiences of former and current celebrities that were once child stars, including actors like Drake Bell, pop singer Ariana Grande, Amanda Bynes, Jamie Lynn Spears, Jennette McCurdy and others.
• Another new addition to our list is a two-part documentary about the well-documented sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey, the former Hollywood superstar and Academy Award winner. The series includes some background about Spacey’s rise to stardom, and his spectacular fall from grace amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior during his career. 10 men are interviewed in the documentary, and all allege they were victims of assault by Spacey.
• Perhaps the most-watched true crime series of the year so far, “The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard” was a hit when it first aired and continues to be in high demand as more true crime fans find the Lifetime movie streaming on demand for free. But that isn’t the only film and documentary about the murder of Dee Dee Blanchard, which has led to renewed new interest in the case after Gypsy Rose was released from prison in December 2023.
• If that wasn’t enough Gypsy Rose Blanchard for you, A 2018 documentary about the Gypsy Rose Blanchard case titled “Gypsy’s Revenge” is also streaming for free on Philo. This documentary features interviews with Dr. Bernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who treated Blanchard, but did not recognize her as a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. It also has detailed interviews with the killer, Nicholas Godejohn. Watch “Gypsy’s Revenge” now on Philo (free trial).
• Another documentary that is different than the other cases listed above, the story of Kyron Horman’s disappearance gripped the country and was one of the most compelling cases of disappeared children in American history. The Investigation Discovery film, “Little Boy Lost: An ID Mystery” is about Kyron’s disappearance and all of the figures involved in his life both before and after his disappearance.
• If you missed it back in November, be sure to catch up on “The Lost Women of Highway 20,” a three-part series about serial killer John Arthur Ackroyd who murdered women in Oregon over three decades before his capture. Produced by Octavia Spencer, the new series is based on The Oregonian/OregonLive’s original five-part narrative documentary videos called “Ghosts of Highway 20.” All three episodes of “The Lost Women of Highway 20″ series can be watched back-to-back-to-back right now.
• A shocking case that was in the news more recently, you can also watch “The Idaho College Murders” to catch up on the story about the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students at the hands of 28-year-old alleged killer Bryan Christopher Kohberger. This was a case that shook the small town of Moscow, Idaho back in November of 2022. Watch ID Network’s “The Idaho College Murders” on demand now.
• “Jared from Subway: Catching a Monster” An exclusive look into the rise and fall of the disgraced weight-loss sensation and the investigation that brought him down.
• “The Curious Case of Natalia Grace” isn’t so much a tale of murder as it is a disturbing recounting of the story of Natalia Grace, assumed to be a 6-year-old Ukrainian orphan with Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Congenita, a rare bone disorder; her adoptive parent alleged Natalia was an adult who was masquerading as a child with intent to harm the family.
• While it is more of a series rather than a documentary, “The Playboy Murders” has new episodes that tell the story of murders that intersect with players behind the scenes at Playboy Magazine, exposing the pitfalls of fame for those appearing on their pages and forcing audiences to question everything they thought they knew about one of America’s most recognizable publications.
Unlike some streaming services that produce and offer some of their own original movies and shows, Philo has over 70 cable networks available to stream live and on demand — all without actually having cable.
Philo is in the same class as streaming services like Fubo and Sling. It is a service that lets viewers watch live and on demand content from several cable networks, without subscribing to a cable service. Where it is slightly different from its peers, however, is Philo does not include local channels or live sports packages in its streaming subscription. It also does not come with an ad-free option.
Philo tends to be a great fit for folks that love reality TV, traditional drama series and more expanded cable network programming. If you want more information, be sure to read our detailed streaming guide for Philo TV.
Yes, Philo costs only $25 a month after your free trial is up. It is one of the least expensive services out there for streaming and on demand television. If you want the Epix add-on, it will end up costing you an extra $6 per month. If you also want Starz, that will add another $9 per month. Before you purchase, consider doing an unlimited DVR free trial to see how you like the service.
