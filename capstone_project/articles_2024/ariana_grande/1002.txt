Young Blues keeper Harry Wright has apologised for comments he made on social media in the wake of last night’s suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena. 
The Snapchat posts made while out in Manchester angered Blues supporters who dubbed them “disrespectful” and “crass and insensitive”, while a number reported the matter to the club.
Twenty-two people are confirmed to have been killed and 59 injured in the blast which came as young fans left an Ariana Grande concert.
In a statement Wright, 18, said: "I would like to apologise wholeheartedly for the insensitive comments I made on social media while out in Manchester last night.
“I wasn’t aware of the full situation regarding the tragic events when I made those comments but that is no excuse, it was a massive error of judgment and something I deeply regret. My thoughts and condolences go out to all the victims and their families."
Town are holding an internal investigation into the matter with spokesman Jonathon Ogle adding: "The club would like to reiterate that our thoughts and condolences are with all those people affected by the deeply tragic events in Manchester last night."

Ipswich-born Wright, who subsequently removed all his social media accounts, was an academy schoolboy with Manchester City until rejoining Town at 16.
His father, ex-Town and England man Richard, finished his career as a back-up keeper at City, where his grandfather, former Blues full-back Geoff Hammond, had also been a player.
Wright junior has just ended the second year of his scholarship with the Blues having featured for the U18s and U23s last season and was recently offered an extension to his professional contract.

He didn't say anything derogatory, just an error of judgement which he has admitted.   17 Europablue added 16:17 - May 23Burnzee1991, it's ridiculous to sack people for stupid things they say, especially when they are only 18.   It's ridiculous that an employer is allowed to fire someone for comments made on social media. What happened to freedom of speech?   It's a better example for children to see their heroes take responsibility for their actions.   As far as I'm concerned this is the end of this issue.  19 Premierbluez added 16:28 - May 23What did he say? I don't see how we can sack him for his personal views unless they are illegal.  0 JackSted added 16:28 - May 23Am I the only one who didn't find what he said that bad? I mean, yeah it was a stupid thing to say but it wasn't like he was mocking the poor people who lost their lives. I think people were too quick to judge his actions because he's a footballer  8 roytheboy added 16:31 - May 23Time to forgive a young lad out having fun, he clearly did not mean any offense, he will learn from this, it wasn't as though he said anything so bad and he obviously did not appreciate the seriousness of what was taking place at the time of his silly post.     4 woohoo added 16:31 - May 23Kids make mistakes. Unfortunately, with social media these days, their mistakes are visible to the world.    8 truckerblue added 16:32 - May 23Insensitive c**t. My daughter was at that concert. Fortunately she was out before it went off. Never met the bloke but if I do I swear I'll put one right on top of his beak.  1 Keaneish added 16:53 - May 23He's barely a bloke though truckerblue, more a child still. I doubt he realised the gravitas of his comments or the severity of the situation at the time. Live and learn.  13 ClausThomsen added 16:54 - May 23He didn't know what was going on.    Another post-tragedy storm in a teacup everyone will have forgotten about in a week.  3 Guru_of_Ipswich added 16:55 - May 2318 year old kid make stupid comment while drunk shocker.    yes it was ill timed but that was all it was, he will hopefully learn from it. end of story.    Im sure we have all done it at some time in our lives, and anybody who says they haven't is talking rubbish.  10 blueboy1981 added 17:02 - May 23......... social media again - at it's worst.    An error of judgement from the lad without doubt, but there are far worse things going on around us all - including the disgusting act itself last night in Manchester.    Sometimes the focus from people is on the less important issues - but that's people for you.    We only need to look at the current state of the Country to prove my point - but that will continuously be overlooked until we have no Country.  10 dirtyboy added 17:05 - May 23Mistake, apology made, move on.  11 happybeingblue added 17:23 - May 23obviously not the sharpest tool in the box! i have a 17 yr old and i would be saddened if they made a comment like they, thankfully they have a bit more savvy and respect !   Ignorance is bliss as they say! Embarrassed that he is an itfc player!    2 Brownie added 17:40 - May 23A crass & insensitive post & one I am sure he regrets.    Every young person makes mistakes. I did but luckily I didn't have social media to highlight them. I would hope I wouldn't have said something as poor as this but having done so he has shown maturity to apologise.    My thoughts are with those affected by last night. They are the ones to concentrate our support on. I suggest Harry will have learnt from his behaviour and he deserves the chance to show people that is the case.    Condolences to those affected.  11 Steve_ITFC_Sweden added 17:48 - May 23Childish and immature, yes, but at 18 he is not alone in that. As long as HE realises that he's been "disrespectful, crass, and insensitive" then it's a learning curve. Could be wrong, but I strongly doubt that he is capable of coming out with "it was a massive error of judgment and something I deeply regret. My thoughts and condolences go out to all the victims and their families" off his own bat. Instead of writing the apology for him, maybe the club should have left him to do it himself.  5 jas0999 added 17:59 - May 23An error of judgement which the lad has apologised for. Club will take care of any further investigation and or disciplinary. The key now is learning from that mistake.   6 Ipswichbusiness added 17:59 - May 23I can understand truckerblue's reaction; that of a father who might have lost his daughter.    However, when I was 18 I'm sure I said some crass, insensitive and downright daft things, one big difference being that there was no social media around to broadcast them.  9 pbishop1799 added 18:01 - May 23Teenage boys say awful things everyday. Many of them, anyway. It's as though they just "don't get" what wider society feels or deems acceptable. The ones that don't eventually develop empathy and thoughtfulness end up on the scrapheap.      He was wrong in every respect, but if he makes something of himself he'll be glad he made this mistake so early in his career.   5 Smithy added 18:14 - May 23Prat  3 Mullet added 18:15 - May 23He'll learn from this. So he should.     Think the club have got it right here and whatever happens to him regarding his football career shouldn't be affected by a clearly childish lack of perspective or thought.   5 blackcat added 18:20 - May 23Silly young boy, most of us have done stupid things and said stupid things at that age even now    Look at the foolish politicians getting caught out every day so cut him some slack.   5 Kesgraveblue57 added 18:32 - May 23We don't want him tear his contract up remarks he made are remarks from an idiot of which we have many down here already he will bring shame to the club get rid of him   -5 therein61 added 18:39 - May 23I really hope he is sincere in his apology and learns from his mistake social media and footballers are not a good mix and clubs should I feel curtail the use of them by young players.
