Ariana Grande is a master of impressions. Weeks after her hilarious impersonation of Jennifer Coolidge in a sketch while hosting Saturday Night Live, she gave a pitch-perfect recreation of a beloved movie character.
The Eternal Sunshine hitmaker appeared on the November 6 episode of the Las Culturistas podcast, hosted by comedian Matt Rogers and Saturday Night Live standout Bowen Yang, for a lengthy chat that also included Grande showing off her impressive impersonation of Hermione Granger, portrayed by Emma Watson, in the Harry Potter films. 
As soon as Yang asked his Wicked co-star to "do your Hermione impression," Grande immediately donned an English accent to shout, "Ron's been splinched!" referencing a line from 2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part I, per People. As they all continued to laugh, she kept going, absolutely nailing Watson's delivery of "No! You can't!" 
"I love the vocal fray so much," Grande said.
Check out the hilarious moment in the video below.
Elsewhere in their chat, Grande explained why her next career move will "scare the absolute s---" out of her fans and Yang apologized for the "over eager" kiss he shared with the singer in a sketch during her time hosting SNL.
On Las Culturistas, Rogers and Yang "get into the hottest pop-culture moments of the day" and even hang out with special guests like Mandy Moore, Agatha All Along star Kathryn Hahn and pop icon Mariah Carey, to name a few. Check out more episodes of the Las Culturistas podcast at iHeart.com.
