	It’s fair to say that a lot of people at first thought that Ariana Grande’s song “Boy Is Mine,” from her latest album, “Eternal Sunshine,” was a cover of the Brandy and Monica duet of the same title that dominated the summer of 1998.

	It’s not — but she’s doubled down on the resemblance by teaming up with Brandy and Monica for a remix of the song, which comes out on Friday. Grande made the announcement on social media on Monday morning.

	The news is not that much of a surprise, considering the fact that both singers make cameos in Grande’s recently released “Batman”/“Catwoman”-themed video for the song, which co-stars actor Penn Badgley.
