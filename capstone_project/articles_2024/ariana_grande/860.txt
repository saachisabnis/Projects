Ariana Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine” will unsurprisingly win this week’s US album sales and consumption races.
According to Hits Daily Double, the album is on pace to close the March 8-14 tracking period with 68K pure US sales. With units from track sales and streams included, it may generate 196K in total first-week US consumption.
The former will yield a #1 bow on Billboard Top Album Sales, while the latter will be enough for a dominant #1 on the Billboard 200. “Eternal Sunshine” will be her sixth album to top each of the charts.
The album campaign kicked off with the chart-topping single “yes, and?” The current radio representative is “we can’t be friends,” which itself is vying for a strong Hot 100 debut.
