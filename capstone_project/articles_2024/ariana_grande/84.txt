Victoria’s Secret has confirmed the return of its annual fashion show after a hiatus since 2018. The announcement comes in response to customer feedback, and the show is expected to deliver the glamour, runway, fashion, fun, wings, and entertainment that fans have been asking for. L Brands, the parent company, had canceled the show in 2019 to evolve the brand’s marketing strategy. The show, which began in 1995, featured performances by Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, and showcased models like Heidi Klum and Kendall Jenner. Last year, Victoria’s Secret experimented with a reimagined event called “The Tour ’23” that streamed on Prime Video.
