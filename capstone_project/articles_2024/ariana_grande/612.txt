Ariana Grande slammed all the haters criticizing her for the way her voice occasionally changes, calling out the double standard when it comes to the response to male method actors.
In a new interview, the Eternal Sunshine singer addressed the commentary she received last month over a video showing her voice fluctuating octaves from high to low while speaking with Penn Badgley on his PodCrushed podcast. Noting that her voice changing is "a normal thing people do, especially if you have a large range," she pointed out that she also spent a long time in her role as Glinda while filming the upcoming movie adaptation of the hit musical Wicked, per People. 
"I did just spend a long time playing a character every single day," she said. "[I trained] my voice to do different things for a long time before leaving for London and before any of this. The voice is in the body, it's an instrument and muscle memory is a real thing."
Grande also called out the double standards in place where she was criticized for reportedly staying in character outside of filming while other actors are often praised for doing the same thing.
"I mean you see male actors, sure people make jokes here and there as well, but it's always after the fact they're like, 'Oh wow, how dedicated to his craft! What an amazing transformation! He's a brilliant performer!'" she said. "But then it's like, god forbid I sneeze like Glinda or something, [then] it's just that I am crazy ... it's the weirdest thing."
