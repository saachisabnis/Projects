Kamala Harris held her first rally as the new Democratic presidential nominee at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta on Tuesday (July 30). Megan Thee Stallion opened the event with a mashup of hits. 
“I WANT TO start off by saying Hotties for Harris!” the “BOA” hitmaker yelled out to the crowd as she took the stage. She wore a bright blue cropped blazer over a button-down, pants, and a necktie to match. 
The Texas rapper and her dancers came out to her 2020 hit “Girls in the Hood.” She also performed her viral hit “Mamushi” as the crowd sang along. Before transitioning into “Body,” she said, “Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies. If you want to keep loving your bodies, you know who to vote for!”
As Megan performed the remix to “Savage,” she added that “real savages” vote. She continued, “I’m so happy to be here Atlanta! We’re about to make history with the first female president. The first Black female president! Let’s get this done!”
As reported by BET, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Harris. The vice president received support from other stars like Cardi B, Lizzo, John Legend, Maxwell, Ariana Grande, and more.
