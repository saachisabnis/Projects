Celebrities, designers, and stylists gathered at the Upper East Side for the 2024 Met Gala. The theme, “Garden of Time” was showcased under the title “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.”
Here are our favorite looks from the 2024 Met Gala red carpet roundup. We tried to keep the list to those who dressed in the theme but made a few exceptions for those who looked exceptionally hot or spectacular.
