Ariana Grande confirmed that her highly-anticipated new album, Eternal Sunshine, will include a reimagined version of Brandy and Monica’s classic song, “The Boy Is Mine.” Grande mentioned the track during a new interview, explaining that she wanted to create her own version of the popular “90s girl group vibe.”
Monica, one of the original singers of the song, has previously expressed her preference for the original to “remain untouched.” But Grande is excited about her version nonetheless. “I’ve always wanted to re-imagine [‘The Boy Is Mine’] in some kind of way… In a way, I was kind of like, ‘This is a very bad idea.’ But there is a large group of my fans that really do love a bad girl anthem, and this is an elevated version of that,” she said.
