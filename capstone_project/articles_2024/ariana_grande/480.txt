Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine spends a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated March 30), after debuting atop the tally a week ago. The set earned 100,500 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the tracking week ending March 21 (down 56%), according to Luminate. It’s the third Grande album to have logged a personal-best two weeks at No. 1. Her last two full-length studio sets, Positions (in 2020) and Thank U, Next (2019), both spent their first two weeks at No. 1.

	Plus, Kacey Musgraves’ Deeper Well starts at No. 2 with her biggest week ever by both equivalent album units and traditional album sales, while Justin Timberlake’s Everything I Thought It Was launches at No. 4.

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new March 30, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Tuesday (March 26). For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	Of Eternal Sunshine’s 100,000 units earned in the tracking week ending March 21, SEA units comprise 87,000 (down 41%, equaling 115.05 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs), album sales comprise 13,000 (down 56%) and TEA units comprise 500 (down 84%).

	Kacey Musgraves’ Deeper Well makes a splash, as it debuts at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 97,000 equivalent album units earned — her biggest week, by units, since the chart began ranking by that measurement in December 2014. Further, of the album’s first-week units, traditional album sales comprise 66,000 — Musgraves’ biggest sales week ever.

	Of Deeper Well’s first-week unit sum of 97,000, traditional album sales comprise 66,000 (it’s the top-selling album of the week), SEA units comprise 30,000 (equaling 38.06 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs) and TEA units comprise 1,000.

	










Deeper Well is Musgraves’ highest-charting album since her debut effort, Same Trailer Different Park, debuted and peaked at No. 2 in 2013.

Deeper Well is the fifth top 10-charting effort for Musgraves, and all of them have started in the top four of the ranking. She previously visited the region with Star-Crossed (No. 3, 2021), Golden Hour (No. 4, 2018), Pageant Material (No. 3, 2015) and Same Trailer Different Park (No. 2, 2013).

Deeper Well’s first-week unit sum surpasses Musgraves’ previous high, by units earned, when Star-Crossed debuted with 77,000 units. And, Deeper Well’s first-week sales figure is her best sales frame ever, beating the 55,000 that Pageant Material sold in its first week.

	The new album was led by a pair of charting tracks on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart: the title track (reaching No. 26 in February) and “Too Good To Be True” (No. 41 earlier in March). Deeper is Musgraves’ first album since 2021, while in 2023 she scored her biggest chart hit ever on the Hot Country Songs and all-genre Billboard Hot 100 charts, when Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” on which she’s featured, topped both tallies. The song, her first leader on both lists, was released on Bryan’s self-titled 2023 album, but is not on Deeper.

	Musgraves supported the album launch with appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (March 14), NBC’s Today (March 15) and SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show (March 18). Prior to the album’s release on March 15, Musgraves was the musical guest on the March 2 episode of NBC’s Saturday Night Live.

Deeper Well’s first-week sales were supported by its availability across nine vinyl variants, including eight different-colored versions and exclusive editions for Amazon, Spotify and Target. In total, the album sold 37,000 copies on vinyl — the top-selling vinyl set of the week, Musgraves’ biggest sales week ever on vinyl, the largest vinyl week of 2024, and the fourth-largest week for a country album on vinyl since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. (The only bigger sales weeks on vinyl for country sets were all registered by Taylor Swift’s re-recordings.)

	










Deeper Well was also issued in four different CD versions, three different digital editions (two were exclusive to her webstore — one with a bonus track, and another with the same bonus track an alternate cover art) and as a cassette tape.

Morgan Wallen’s chart-topping One Thing at a Time slips 2-3 on the new Billboard 200, pushed down with a 3% gain to 70,000 equivalent album units earned.

	Justin Timberlake returns to the Billboard 200 with his first album in over six years, as Everything I Thought It Was starts at No. 4. The set opens with 67,000 equivalent album units earned and marks Timberlake’s sixth consecutive top five-charting effort — the entirety of his solo releases, which includes four No. 1s.

	Of Everything’s first-week unit sum of 67,000, traditional album sales comprise 41,000, SEA units comprise 24,000 (equaling 31.13 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs) and TEA units comprise 2,000.

	The new album was led off by the single “Selfish,” which peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated Feb. 10. The track has also reached the top 20 of the Radio Songs, Pop Airplay, Adult Pop Airplay, Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic Airplay charts.

Everything’s release was ushered in by a much-buzzed-about one-off concert at The Wiltern in Los Angeles (March 13). The show featured a surprise reunion with his *NSYNC bandmates, with the group playing a medley of hits and the new Everything track “Paradise.” Timberlake also turned up on NPR’s Tiny Desk series on March 15 for a half-hour-long concert. Earlier in the week, on March 11, he performed the album’s “No Angels” on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Everything’s first-week sales were aided by its availability across four different vinyl variants (including exclusives for Amazon, Target and his webstore), four different deluxe CD boxed sets (each with a piece of branded clothing and a CD) and a standard CD.

	










Noah Kahan’s Stick Season falls 3-5 on the new Billboard 200 with 46,000 equivalent album units earned (down 5%). Five former No. 1s round out the rest of the top 10, as SZA’s SOS dips 5-6 (43,000; down 4%), Swift’s Lover climbs 9-7 (41,000; up 6%), Bryan’s self-titled album falls 6-8 (40,000; down 2%), Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) descends 8-9 (nearly 40,000; up 3%) and Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 1 drops 4-10 (39,000; down 13%).
