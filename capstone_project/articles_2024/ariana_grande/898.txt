We’re back at the Effra Social tonight to continue our Friday night residency, but this time we’ll be cracking out the tinnies and having a beach party to celebrate Australia Day.
As ever, you can expect another big, free night of fun, with DJs throwing down huge party tunes with tons of added Oz-ness, so you can expect hits from Kylie, INXS, AC/DC,  Natalie Imbruglia, Men At Work, Crowded House and more down-under greats. It’s going to be bonzer!

We’ll be shimmying in behind the decks at 10pm  and playing tunes until 1am – to guarantee entry you might want to book a table here.
Hope to see you on the dancefloor!
