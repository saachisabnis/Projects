This week:
Possible RFK Brain Worms, Ranked
I, like most of America, have not stopped thinking about the story that doctors found a dead worm in Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.‚Äôs brain. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúwell, that certainly explains things‚Äù anecdote in an era of entirely inexplicable nonsense. This bozo literally had ‚Äúbrain worms,‚Äù the catch-all phrase we use for someone whose asinine ideas suggest they are absolutely losing their mind.

Given my obsession with this, when I saw this tweet, I laughed for about two minutes, sent it to each of my four-to-five friends, laughed again each time I pressed ‚Äúsend,‚Äù and now am writing about it.

The tweet also made me think, who was that worm chomping on RFK‚Äôs brain? What‚Äôs her story? It‚Äôs my worms-for-brain idea of the week: Here is a ranking of the worms who are most likely to have been in RFK‚Äôs brain.
The sandworms from Dune
They‚Äôre too hip right now. RFK wishes.
Grey Worm from Game of Thrones
Noble. Very hot. A eunuch. None of those characteristics apply to what I think of RFK.
The space slugs from Star Wars
Tried to kill Han Solo. Seems like something dastardly that RFK would do.
The sandworms from Beetlejuice
They‚Äôre a little goofy, yet will give you a jumpscare when they show up. That tracks with my experience whenever I read a new RFK story.
Earthworm from James and the Giant Peach
Blind to the world and a bit of a doomsdayer. Also tracks.
The Very Hungry Caterpillar
Caterpillars are technically not worms, though, according to a two-second Google search, they are ‚Äúcold-blooded like worms.‚Äù That fits the bill for something that would eat bits of a Kennedy‚Äôs brain and then just die in there.
As this person posted on X, it would make for an apt addition to the classic children‚Äôs book:

The Most Important Met Gala Thoughts
Listen: People who have more expertise in the world of fashion than I do‚Äîas in, literally know anything about it‚Äîhave already weighed on the looks celebrities wore to the Met Gala. I can‚Äôt give any worthwhile commentary on that. What I can do, however, is point you toward the random moments that happened at the event that made me squeal with glee.
Donatella Versace arrived escorted by Andrew Scott and Jude Law, two hotties who have starred in adaptations of The Talented Mr. Ripley, and lived out a very specific sex dream I had last week.

Kylie Minogue danced to her own song at a Met Gala after party, and was grinded on by both Andrew Scott and Jonathan Bailey‚Äîweirdly also a very specific sex dream I had last week.

While Shakira was posing and being fawned over by photographers and press, Michael Shannon walked in front of the frame carrying a bag of potato chips, marching begrudgingly up the stairs into the gala. A very specific se‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just kidding.

Finally, Ariana Grande brought her Wicked co-star Cynthia Erivo on stage to duet to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen You Believe.‚Äù No jokes. Just chills.

Not This Casting‚Ä¶
Just when I was finally feeling at peace with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce as a celebrity couple‚Äîthere were no longer news stories written about them every six hours, and we‚Äôd been spared the weekly camera on Swift‚Äôs face as she watched her boyfriend‚Äôs football game‚Äîthis week ruined everything.
Swift‚Äôs Eras tour resumed after a hiatus in Paris, her first performance since the release of The Tortured Poets Department. You can only imagine how not-chill Swifties were about documenting every song on the set list, costume change, breath Taylor took, what her blood pressure was at any given moment‚Ä¶
Then there was also the news that Kelce was cast in a new Ryan Murphy series titled Grotesquerie. Stunt casting is fun‚Ä¶ to a point. I hate this. But I did laugh at this post:
Casting him in something he can‚Äôt pronounce is crazy https://t.co/Z6bnjBkevc
A Reason to Live
Wee-oo, wee-oo! (If your brain isn‚Äôt as broken as mine, that‚Äôs an alarm sounding, written out as text.) Important Reba McEntire news just dropped!
