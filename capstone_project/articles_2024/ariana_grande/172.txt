Ariana Grande had a funny response when she was scolded by her mom, Joan Grande, after being caught her checking her phone during the movie.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Ariana has "lost count" how many times she's seen the film, so checking her phone shouldn't be a big deal, right? Well, she recalled, "When I saw it with my nonna in Florida, I did check my phone a few times and my mom was like, 'Ariana, get off your phone!"
But, Ari defended herself, and hilariously replied, "And I was like, 'Mommy, not only have I seen it, but I’m in it!' I was like, 'I know what happens here. I think I can quickly check what was just sent to me!' She’s like, 'Ariana, you’re talking!'"
Moral of the story: Do not text or talk while watching Wicked.
Wicked received several Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy and Cinematic Box Office Achievement. Grande was also nominated in the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for her role as Glinda, while Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in the film, received a nomination for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy.
After learning she had been nominated for a Golden Globe, Ariana shared her reaction on her Instagram stories, writing, "I am floored and honored to be recognized by members of the Golden Globes. Crying (of course). It's impossible to find my words, but I am simply, so deeply grateful for this acknowledgement." She also congratulated Cynthia for her nomination, as well as the rest of the cast and crew.
