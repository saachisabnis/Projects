Jason Kelce and his pregnant wife, Kylie Kelce, reportedly had a “blast” with Pete Davidson at the NFL commentator’s holiday party Friday night.
The “Saturday Night Live” alum “went with a couple of friends and got onstage with Jason and Eagles’ Jordan Mailata to perform,” an insider told People following the festive shindig.
“Pete seems like he’s doing great,” the source added. “Everyone was having a blast.”
His presence at the party came a day after he admitted he does not “want to be this f–king loser who just dates people” while speaking with W magazine. 
“I just want to be known for doing good work. I want to be out there only when it’s movie, stand-up, charity, or business ventures,” he added.
Davidson, 31, has dated several Hollywood stars over the years, including Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale.
He is last known to have dated “Outer Banks” star Madelyn Cline. The comedian checked himself into a mental health institution in July — about a month after they were reported to have split.
It’s unclear what famous names attended Jason’s party alongside Davidson, if any. 
The former NFL star, 37, threw the party to celebrate his and his former Philadelphia Eagles linemen Mailata and Lane Johnson’s third and final Philadelphia-themed holiday album, “A Philly Special Christmas Party.”
The 12-track album, profits of which will be donated to Philadelphia-based organizations to help children in need, includes exciting special guests, including Kylie, 32, Boyz II Men and Stevie Nicks.
Jason’s brother, Travis Kelce, also sang on the album but skipped the festivities to celebrate his girlfriend Taylor Swift’s 35th birthday Friday evening. 
Page Six exclusively reported that the pair celebrated together and that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, also 35, showered the “Bad Blood” singer with gifts.
