The internet has been in a frenzy ever sinceÂ StormzyÂ was spotted locking lips with Grammy-winning R&B star Victoria MonÃ©t.
The news comes just three months after his final split from TV hostÂ Maya Jama, which shocked fans of the couple. 
The 31-year-old rapper, whose real name is Michael Owuo Jr., was photographed getting affectionate with MonÃ©t, 35, atÂ Londonâ€™s Heathrow Airport on Thursday evening, even sharing a steamy kiss. 
The moment comes after hisÂ much-publicized breakup from Maya Jama in July 2023. The couple first began dating in 2014 but split after five years, with rumours of infidelity playing a role, but they reunited in 2022. 
MonÃ©t is also recently single, having split from John Gaines earlier this year.
Now, it looks MonÃ©t has moved on with Stormzy, and many social media users are shocked.

For those unfamiliar with Victoria MonÃ©t and her incredible talent, hereâ€™s everything you need to know about Stormzyâ€™s latest romantic interest.
MonÃ©t is also recently single, having split from her two-year-old daughterâ€™s father, John Gaines, earlier this year. They had reportedly been dating since 2020.
Gaines works as a fitness instructor.
They shared this statement at the time: â€˜Ultimately, we decided to be open and address it in hopes to put a period on the question marks for the sake of our healing process.
â€˜We spent the last 10 months trying to respectfully and privately navigate the fact that we are no longer in a relationship. Though we still completely adore and respect each other, we are not a couple anymore.â€™
Itâ€™s been rumoured that MonÃ©t also previously dated singer Kehlani. 
Victoria MonÃ©t McCants was born on May 1, 1989, in Georgia but was raised in Sacramento, California.
Before shooting to superstardom as a solo artist, MonÃ©t first gained recognition as a songwriter and is best known for her work with pop superstar Ariana Grande, with whom she has developed a close creative partnership. 
MonÃ©t co-wrote several of Grandeâ€™s biggest hits, including Thank U, Next, 7 Rings, Be Alright, and Monopoly. She received her first Grammy nomination in 2020 for her work with Grande. Her songwriting credits donâ€™t stop there, though. 
MonÃ©t has also written for artists like Fifth Harmony, Nas, Chris Brown, and Chloe x Halle.
She soon transformed her success as a songwriter into an explosive career as a solo artist. 
Her debut EP, Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1 (2014), was released to favourable reviews and was followed up by Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 2 (2015).
But MonÃ©tâ€™s breakthrough moment as a solo artist came with the release of her critically acclaimed project Jaguar in 2020. 
MonÃ©tâ€™s growing influence in the music world was further cemented when she was nominated for a Grammy in 2022 for Best Traditional R&B Performance with her song Hollywood, which featured her daughter, Hazel, making her the youngest-ever Grammy nominee.
The album, which blends neo-soul, funk, and R&B, earned massive global attention for its fresh sound, with standout tracks like Moment, Experience, and the title track Jaguar.
The follow-up album, Jaguar II, which came out in 2023, was her breakthrough into the mainstream. It spawned a single which peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year.
MonÃ©t was nominated for seven Grammys in total at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, and she took home the trophies for Best New Artist, Best R&B Album, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.
Her music often explores themes of love and personal empowerment, with a focus on celebrating Black womenâ€™s beauty and strength.
Sheâ€™s also an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ representation. In 2018, she came out as bisexual and has since been vocal about the importance of visibility in the music industry. 
In interviews, MonÃ©t has discussed the importance of being open about her sexuality in order for people who feel misrepresented to feel seen. 
While it remains unclear what exactly is happening between MonÃ©t and Stormzy, the idea of two musical powerhouses in one couple is undeniably exciting.
