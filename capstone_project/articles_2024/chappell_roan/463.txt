 It’s a smart strategy too, to drop LG7 around the same time as the Grammys and Oscars. She will be visible everywhere! I wonder if she will perform. The lead single and maybe more will be out by the time of the Grammys, as well as Die with a Smile. I can see her and Bruno performing for sure, at the very least, and possibly her own performance too. 
That “new pop record” and “a secret music project” difference that Vogue makes on the article/caption makes me think there’s another project/album/ep/whatever coming besides LG7 (it’s obviously not the OST)
Maybe a duets album?

When she releases the secret music project during final voting next year to snatch that 2nd PVA win!
<p style=”text-align: right;”>The second biggest trad pop artist with Grammys is buble, maybe that’s gagas new duet partner</p>
LG7 snippets sound electro, dance, and industrial. She can easily be the frontrunner in Dance Pop Recording. Other Pop categories are TBD. Who are other Pop contenders expected to drop next year besides Harry? And possibly Taylor again lol.

The better question is who will be next year’s Chappell Roan/Sabrina Carpenter/Olivia Rodrigo/Billie Eilish. With a lot of the big names off the board, the potential for a new younger star to emerge is high.
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
Madison Beer just got a Top 10 radio hit and Twitter stans are pushing her since forever. I would keep an eye on her because Sabrina’s boom started similarly. Another option is Tyla moving from afrobeats to pop/r&b in her sophomore record. People want her to be new Rihanna so bad. Addison Rae is growing on daily charts with Diet Pepsi. Another pop newcomer to observe. Renee Rapp is still waiting for her breakthrough too.
When radio spammed nonsense, at least the song was able to make the top 100, peaking in 50s.
Madison did not
Rumors going around that Tay recorded The Tortured Poets Department: Long Pond Studio Sessions. If she releases this during the voting period I fear it’s over ladies! 
for real? The rumors stopped running my way since I’m off twitter
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
IMO, AOTY is 100% between Bey and Billie. Whoever wins it would be a nice choice. I like both records. Can’t see any other track beating “Die With A Smile” in all categories. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars are the frontrunners. This song is going to be everywhere: births, weddings, funerals, you name it. Pop Solo is really between the 4 girlies for me. I’m currently leaning towards Sabrina. 
I’m coming back from the dead to haunt whoever plays that travesty at my funeral

Honey, Lady Gaga will NOT ever win in the General Field.  We go through this every fucking time she is eligible.

I love the song but I cackled and spat my tea out! 🤣 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!
I love Gaga and happy for her but LG7 is part of next year’s race, let’s talk about this year’s contenders. Particularly DWA.

Pop Guy is right. Keep it on topic and take it to the LG7 thread

Get real!  Sabrina Crapenter is NOT top 2 in Record of the Year.  Pure delusion.
