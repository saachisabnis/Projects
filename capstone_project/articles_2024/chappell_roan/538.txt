Chappell Roan has canceled certain tickets to her upcoming show in Franklin, Tennessee, that her team believes were purchased by scalpers and bots. “We went through and canceled all the scalper tickets we could, so from that we’re going to release a limited number of tickets to you, because I want to make sure that tickets go to people who actually want to come and, like, our fans,” Chappell said in a video shared to her Instagram Story on Wednesday. “This is a larger issue … we’re dealing with it.
