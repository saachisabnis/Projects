Chappell Roan often references her small-town roots in her music. In fact, one of her most-listened to tracks is “Pink Pony Club,” where she directly mentions her mom. So, who exactly are Chappell’s parents — and does she have any siblings?
Keep reading for everything to know about her parents siblings and more. 
Chappell, whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, was born on February 19, 1998, in Willard, Missouri to parents Dwight Amstutz and Kara Amstutz. Her mother is a veterinarian while her father manages a family practice in Springfield, Missouri and is also a registered nurse.
The singer-songwriter has opened up about her conservative and Christian childhood, where she says she went to church almost three days every week. While she’s been transparent about her family’s differing “views and values,” she has said that “they still support” her projects.
In December 2024, Chappell’s parents were featured in Apple TV+’s special Christmas episode of Carpool Karaoke. At one point in the drive, her father gets teary-eyed while singing “Pink Pony Club,” which references Chappell telling her family that she would never leave them behind.

“I hope that that’s something that she always knows, that we love her so much, and we could never not be proud of her,” Dwight explained, after the song came to an end. “I think about this a lot and try not to get emotional about it.”
He continued, “What she has taught me as a father is respect for other people and all people, and that’s what I want people to understand. Everything that is about her is about loving everybody, and she has taught me that.”
Chappell is the oldest of four children; she has a younger sister named Kamryn and two younger brothers named Dawson and Drew.
“We’re just a very normal household,” she told Springfield News-Leader of her upbringing in 2017. “No one in my family is musical, none of my cousins, no one in my immediate family is musical.”
However, she got her musical footing after beginning piano lessons at age 12, then singing at a talent show in the eighth grade which she won. After that, she said she tried out for America’s Got Talent but ultimately didn’t make the cut.
“I was like 14,” she said of the audition. “I didn’t make it; I had no idea what I was doing.”
However, she was ultimately signed to Atlantic Records at age 16, and skipped her last year of high school to pursue a singing career in Los Angeles. While she was ultimately dropped from the label in 2020 after putting out her semi-autobiographical song “Pink Pony Club,” she was forced to move back home to Missouri — where she stayed until giving music another shot in 2021 (and thank goodness she did).
