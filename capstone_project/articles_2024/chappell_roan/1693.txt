Over the weekend, Chappell Roan made headlines for canceling her performances at the All Things Go Festival, which were set for September 28 and 29 in New York City and Columbia, Maryland.
In a message posted on Instagram Stories on September 27, Roan wrote, “I apologize to people who have been waiting to see me in NYC & DC this weekend at All Things Go, but I am unable to perform.”
She continued, “Things have gotten overwhelming over the past few weeks and I am really feeling it. I feel pressures to prioritize a lot of things right now and I need a few days to prioritize my health. I want to be present when I perform and give the best shows possible. Thank you for understanding. Be back soon xox.”
Roan’s cancellation has left fans concerned about her upcoming scheduled performances, including her next headlining set at the Austin City Limits (ACL) Music Festival on October 6 and 13.
As of the time of publication, Roan is still scheduled to perform at both weekends of ACL.
Tickets to ACL are still available for purchase online through secondary market platforms such as Vivid Seats, SeatGeek and StubHub, which offer verified tickets with a buyer’s guarantee.

The decision came after 26-year-old Roan revealed feeling overwhelmed by recent acclaim. In late August, Roan spoke out against “creepy” fan behavior on social media, expressing her desire for boundaries. She later opened up about her struggles with “severe depression,” indicating that if her career became too taxing, she might consider stepping away.
Despite Roan’s absence, performers and fans alike showed their support for the artist at the All Things Go Festival. MUNA delivered a lively headlining set, covering Roan’s hit “Good Luck Babe!” while drag performers energized the crowd by performing Roan’s songs in a DJ set.
