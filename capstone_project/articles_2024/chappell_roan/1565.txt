In order to avoid conflicting with the upcoming US Presidential Debate, MTV has changed the date of the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards from Tuesday, September 10 to Wednesday, September 11. In addition to announcing the new broadcast date of the VMA’s, MTV also revealed the first batch of performers scheduled for the awards show, featuring Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Camila Cabello, GloRilla, and Rauw Alejandro. This will be Cabello’s third performance on the VMAs, but the first appearance for all the other artists, though Carpenter did perform during last year’s pre-show festivities leading up to the ceremony. All five artists scheduled to  performer during the ceremony are also 2024 VMA nominees, with Carpenter up for six awards, GloRilla for three, Roan and Alejandro for two, and Cabello for one.
