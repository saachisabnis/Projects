At the MTV VMAs in September, Chappell Roan wasn’t shy about calling out photographers who yelled at her on the red carpet. And at the Los Angeles premiere of her friend Olivia Rodrigo‘s Netflix special on Friday, Chappell demanded an apology for another photographer who she accused of being rude to her.
In an exchange captured by Pop Crave, Chappell is posing for pics on the red carpet when she pointed at one photog and said, “You were so disrespectful to me at the Grammys.”
“You yelled at me at a Grammy party,” said Chappell, and then appeared to get into a back-and-forth with the photographer, who isn’t seen on camera. “Yes, I remember. You were so rude to me. And I deserve an apology for that … You need to apologize to me … don’t do that to another artist again.”
Then, someone came and dragged Chappell away.
At the same event on Friday, Olivia told Billboard of Chappell, who opened for her on her GUTS World Tour, “She actually gives me so much advice on taking care of myself and being me in an industry that’s so overwhelming sometimes. I really appreciate her.”
