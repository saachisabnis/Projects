Home » The Cure’s Robert Smith Identifies With Chappell Roan’s Struggle With Obsessive Fan Behavior
During a recent appearance on the BBC podcast Sidetracked, The Cure’s frontman Robert Smith said he could relate to Chappell Roan’s recent headline-making complaints about obsessive fans who continue to invade her privacy. While Smith has dealt with passionate fans who occasionally have crossed the lines over his 45-year career, he admits that the music world is completely different – and more dangerous – nowadays. “I think what you’re doing as an artist, you want people to feel like they’re engaging with you,” Smith explained. “But it is a modern-world phenomenon that there’s a sense of entitlement that didn’t used to be there amongst fans.” Smith reflected on his own early music fandom and how much things have changed in the social media era. “It was enough to see Alex Harvey or to see David Bowie,” Smith reflects. “I didn’t expect to hang out with them or get to know them, whereas now it seems almost like that is part of the deal.” (Variety)
