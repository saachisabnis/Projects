	“The juices have never dried up. They never want to dry up because I’m always looking to create things. It’s just having the space now to do it at my own time. Of course there will be new Elton John music,” he added to cheers from the crowd.

	










	Reflecting on his Apple Music show Rocket Hour, John spoke passionately about supporting emerging artists like Chappell Roan. “When I first heard [her], I think I was the first person to play ‘Pink Pony Club.’ I interviewed her, and then we became friends. These young artists have so much energy, they’re so good, and if I can help them in any way get a foot on a ladder, I will.”

	Brandi Carlile, Elton’s collaborator on the theme song for Never Too Late, joined him during the interview. The two shared stories about their friendship and creative process, including how Brandi’s heartfelt letter to Elton sparked their relationship. 

	Elton described their bond, saying, “I was doing a residency in Vegas at the time, so I asked her to come to Vegas and I played and sang on the record and as soon as I saw her, I became friends with her. It was like I’d known her all my life.”

	This revelation follows the release of Never Too Late, the theme song for his Disney+ documentary of the same name.

	Elsewhere in the interview, Elton reminisced about the artists who shaped his career. “Ray Charles touched my heart. Little Richard touched my heart. Elvis Presley changed my life with ‘Heartbreak Hotel.’ When I first heard that record, I knew I wanted to do this.”
