There's something charming about West Michigan if you're not a native. I spent my entire life in Kentucky, and the first time I visited, I knew I wanted to call this place home one day. It's easy to fall in love with all four seasons when you see them through the West Michigan filter.
That's exactly how One Republic guitarist Zach Filkins felt after visiting the area back in 2019. After playing a concert in Grand Rapids, they traveled south of the city to visit the wineries and fell in love with the area. Little did they know then, they would soon own one of their own.
Zach and his wife, Lindsay bought Karma Vista winery in Coloma, and have renamed it Filkins Vineyards. And, the place is adorable.

Filkins Vineyards officially opened to the public in May. According to their website, they currently produce highly acclaimed wines via sustainable farming and winemaking practices. You don't have to make an appointment to check them out, just show up any day but Tuesday. They say they should have wines available starting this fall, as well.

They also love to showcase their love of the area to their fans across the world on social media, which is a bonus to us.

It'll be fun to see what they do with the Vineyard in years to come, and if we'll ever get lucky enough to have a few extra One Republic concerts in the area as a result of this new venture for Zach and Lindsay. If you like what you see, you can follow their winery on Instagram.
