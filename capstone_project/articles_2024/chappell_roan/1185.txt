Home    Forums    Music    Best New Artist: 2025 GRAMMYs
Why is nobody predicting a nom for The Marías? Their Submarine LP was pretty big and they got widespread acclaim. 
i wasn’t even sure if they’re going to be submitted. if they are then i would maybe predict them for a nom
Honey, if eligible, Sabrina Carpenter is NOT winning Best New Artist.  Chappell Roan is making her know it!
Best New Artist launched in predictions center. But I’m still taking suggestions for additions.
Thank you!!!
Get real!  Chappell Roan is NOT locked to win Best New Artist like Olivia Rodrigo was.  Pure delusion.  There is no frontrunner.

Sorry guys, I think the AI chatbot is broken. It’s programmed contrarian settings appear to be glitching.
For your 2026 Grammy consideration

Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:

RAYE just released another live album. This time from her performance at Montreal Jazz Festival earlier in the year. Said it about her last year, but can really see courting the “real musicianship” vote of the Academy, plus a year out from her BRITs sweep proving she’s not a fluke/one hit wonder, don’t think NARAS will hesitate nominate her, similar to Maneskin.

I can see her getting in. The fact she had a major sweep at the BRITs shows that there is clear industry support for her. I was actually surprised she didn’t get a nomination at the 2024 Grammys, since “Escapism” was an actual hit on Billboard.
Sierra Ferrell was the big winner at the 2024 Americana Honors & Awards. She took home Artist of the Year and Album of the Year for her LP Trail of Flowers. The Red Clay Strays won Best Emerging Act.
This will be very good for their campaign. I’m predicting a BNA nomination for Sierra ‘til the end.

i don’t remember who originally mentioned that Sierra Ferrell made the most sense as an americana / country representative in BNA (Shaboozy aside, i guess), but i just took your word for it and so far you seem to be absolutely right … i think a lot of people owe whoever it was credit if she does get nominated!

She was already being mentioned here during the last GRAMMY cycle (though not much), but I guess this new era of hers just stuck out to me the most and led me to analyze her chances overall 😅
Honey, get real!  Raye is NOT happening in Best New Artist.  Give it up!

She could pull a Best Americana Album win even if Cowboy Carter is submitted there.
Can I just say…I think this has the potential to be the strongest Best New Artist lineup in YEARS!!!! Between Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, ShaBoozey, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims, etc…this is a great group. In fact, I’m going to say this is the strongest group of contenders since 2014. 
Just leaving it here
