Chappell Roan has announced her upcoming performance at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), but it hasn’t been without some controversy. As one of the breakout stars of 2024, Roan’s rise to fame has been meteoric, and her fans have been eagerly awaiting this major milestone in her career. However, a string of recent concert cancellations has left some of her followers frustrated, casting a shadow over what should have been an exciting moment for the singer.
The 25-year-old artist took to Instagram Stories to share a sneak peek of her costume for her debut performance at the VMAs on September 11. In the photo, Roan was dressed in a striking frilly black sombrero-style top paired with matching shorts, a black cone hat, and powdery white makeup. She completed the ensemble by holding two gold sticks while Bhad Bhabie’s song “Hi B***” played in the background. She captioned the post, “I am in @vmas rehearsals guys,” giving fans a behind-the-scenes look at her preparations.
While many were excited to see the singer in rehearsal mode, others couldn’t help but feel conflicted, especially given the timing of her VMAs performance announcement. Just weeks prior, Roan had canceled multiple European shows, leaving fans disappointed. Some fans speculated that the cancellations were due to her VMAs preparations, sparking frustration among those who had been eagerly awaiting her performances abroad.
Before the Instagram post, MTV had already confirmed Roan’s performance on August 12, calling her a “trailblazing breakout star” in a press release. The network highlighted her incredible success over the past year, including her first-ever Top 10 hit on Billboard’s Hot 100 with “Good Luck, Babe!,” her critically acclaimed album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, and record-breaking performances at major music festivals like Lollapalooza and Governor’s Ball. Roan is also up for multiple awards at the VMAs, including Best New Artist, Performance of the Year, Best Trending Video, and Song of Summer.
While this should be a celebratory time for the singer, her recent concert cancellations have stirred up tension within her fan base. Roan canceled shows in Paris and Amsterdam, which were scheduled for September 3 and 4, respectively. Fans quickly noticed that these dates were suspiciously close to her VMAs rehearsal schedule, leading some to speculate that the performance took priority over her international commitments. This sparked frustration, as fans had already purchased tickets and made travel arrangements for her now-canceled shows.
Roan said last August 29 on social media. “Due to scheduling conflicts, I have had to make the extremely hard decision to cancel my Paris and Amsterdam shows. I have rescheduled my Berlin show to 23 September. I am so sorry & very disappointed 🙁 I promise I will be back. I’m heartbroken 💔 thank you for understanding.”
However, this explanation didn’t entirely satisfy some of her followers, who felt that the timing was suspicious and that their support for her was being taken for granted. The frustration boiled over when a viral video of Roan surfaced in August, in which she criticized fans for expecting constant interaction and availability from her. “I don’t give a f*** if you think it’s selfish of me to say no for a photo or for your time or for a hug. That’s not normal, that’s weird!” she stated bluntly in the TikTok video, further intensifying the debate around her recent behavior.
Despite the controversy, many of Roan’s loyal fans continue to support her, understanding the pressures and demands that come with an artist’s growing fame. The VMAs performance represents a major moment in her career, and many are still eager to see how she’ll deliver on the iconic stage. After all, the pressure of balancing an international tour, award show rehearsals, and the spotlight of newfound fame is no small feat.
As Roan gears up for her debut at the VMAs, it remains to be seen how the situation will play out with her international fanbase. But one thing is for sure: all eyes will be on her come September 11, as she takes the stage for what will likely be one of the most important performances of her career.
