Halloween is exactly four weeks from today (October 3), and now we have the much-needed dark-dance bop to fill the month with all the shadowy beats n’ treats fit for spooky season. And this welcome soundtrack is provided by Kota Kira, the Seattle electronic music artist who teams with Staarz to deliver a massive witch house cover of Chappell Roan’s seductive synth ballad and SOTY contender “Good Luck, Babe!” 
Kota Kira’s cover, in all its heavy bass, trap beats, and chopped n’ screwed glory, dropped via Oklahoma label Re:Mission Entertainment, and it’s likely to be the best thing we’ll hear all month.
Of course, we’ve written a lot about Roan over the past 18 months, dating back to last spring when we called her “one of our generation’s greatest and most thrilling songwriters” well before The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess made her a household name. But this occultist re-imagination of her most recent mega-jam just fuels our darkly burning desire even further. 
Take it for a spin across a strobe-lit dance floor below.
