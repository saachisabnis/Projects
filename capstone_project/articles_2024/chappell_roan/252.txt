Ariana Grande is sharing the heartfelt reason behind using her full name, Ariana Grande-Butera, in the credits for the upcoming Wicked movie. 
“Technically, it’s my little girl name! It’s little Ari name,” she revealed, explaining it was the name she grew up with. “I just feel like this experience was such a homecoming for me. I feel like I came home to myself in a lot of ways through what I learned from Glinda, from Elphaba,” Ariana shared during a radio chat.
She continued, “That was my name when I went to see the show when I was 10 years old. It felt like a really lovely way of honoring that. It felt really full circle. It just felt like something I wanted to do.”
Ariana’s full name combines her mom Joan Grande and dad Edward Butera‘s surnames. The “We Can’t Be Friends” artist chose to shorten her name professionally, similar to her half-brother Frankie Grande – whose parents are Joan and Victor Marchione. The 41-year-old performer was born Frank James Michael Grande Marchione.
