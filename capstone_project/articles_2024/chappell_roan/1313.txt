The two recently collaborated on a new remix of the ‘Brat’ Deluxe Edition track
It has been just hours since it was confirmed that Charli XCX and Billie Eilish had joined forces on a new remix of ‘Brat’ deluxe edition track ‘Guess’, and already fans are suspecting that one of the lyrics might be a diss towards Taylor Swift.
Shared last night (August 2), the track is co-produced by The Dare and Finneas, and sees Eilish adopt her whispered cadence for the suggestive and explosive dance track.
It also dropped alongside an Aidan Zamiri-directed music video, which shows Charli and The Dare holding a party in a living room, before Eilish bulldozes her way through the wall.
Now, fans have already begun looking into the lyrics, and suspect that one of the lines towards the end is a subtle jab at fellow pop icon Taylor Swift.
“You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin’ about? (You’ve been disrespectful)/ Still tryin’ to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)/ You wanna guess the address of the party we’re at (You really are not invited),” the two whisper at the end of the track.
The shady lyrics about who the two have been gossiping about are suspected by some fans to be a diss towards Swift, seemingly because the artist blocked both Eilish and Charli from the Number One spot on the charts.
This happened as the ‘Midnights’ singer would release different variants of her latest album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ to maintain her hold on the chart-topping position – something which some fans interpreted as being unfair to other acts (via The Tab).
The outlet also recalled how fuel was added to the fire with the rumours about the ‘Guess’ lyrics following reports of some of Eilish’s team liked negative tweets about the TTPD variants when the album was released. Eilish also made comments about “wasteful” physical album variants.

that lady and her 45 album variants blocked them both from number one albums, but them having more cultural impact and critical acclaim than her in the end is most pleasing to me  pic.twitter.com/44VS9boXew

What’s more, Charli XCX also saw herself at accused of shady comments about Swift recently, as her song ‘Sympathy Is A Knife’ contained a line saying: “Don’t want to see you backstage at my boyfriend’s show”. This was seen by some fans as being about the singer as Charli is engaged to the 1975’s George Daniels, and Swift had a brief romance with the band’s frontman Matty Healy.
The collaboration with Eilish comes just a week after Charli revealed there is more new music on the way, responding to several op-eds that declared the end of her wildly successful ‘Brat summer’.
Among the countless ways that her album has taken over the summer is Chappell Roan sharing a selfie holding a CD copy of ‘Brat’, leading fans to believe that she will feature on a forthcoming Charli track, and Charli recently bringing the album’ to Ibiza for a ‘Party Girl’-inspired set at the Boiler Room.
As for Eilish, in June it was announced that the singer had become the third artist to reach 100million monthly Spotify listeners, and the youngest yet to reach the milestone.
