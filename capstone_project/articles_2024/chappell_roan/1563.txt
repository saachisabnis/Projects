Barack and Michelle Obama have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, according to a video released by Harris' campaign this morning. The endorsement caps a whirlwind week of campaigning for Harris. Yesterday, she reiterated her support for Israel after she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, she said she “will not be silent” about the humanitarian toll in Gaza. Harris expressed that Israel has the right to defend itself, but it's time for the war to end.

One of Mexico’s most notorious drug lords, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, is now in U.S. custody. He founded the Sinaloa cartel along with Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. U.S. authorities announced last night that he was arrested in El Paso, Texas. He will appear before an American judge soon. Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo and one of the cartel leaders, was also arrested. Zambada is arguably the most important drug lord in Mexico, and he had never been caught before. 
Hours before the Olympic opening ceremony is set to begin, SNCF, the French national state-owned railway company, was severely disrupted by what it described as a “massive attack.” The incidents, which included arson, aimed at paralyzing several high-speed lines linking Paris to the rest of France. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into the “willful damage." Many trains have been diverted, others canceled altogether, and repairs are expected all weekend. Even so, the ceremony is expected to go off without a hitch. Athletes and performers will float on boats down the River Seine, where Coco Gauff and LeBron James will be U.S. flag bearers. Here's how to watch the opening ceremony.

I’ve done this in just about every election for twenty years: show up in a politically interesting place and talk with any voter who will talk with me. I knock on doors; you learn so much when you meet people at home. If nobody is answering their door I try parks, parking lots, markets, anything. I ask people how they’re voting but try also to learn a little bit about their lives. Few people are political experts but everyone is expert in their experience.
Twenty or so interviews around Pittsburgh are not enough for a poll but are enough for impressions. I came away with three about Kamala Harris: 

                Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine.
