Like mother, like daughter <3 
2024 is the year of the it girl: from Chappell Roan to Sabrina Carpenter to Tyla. And one woman who has "it" (whatever that is) running through her very veins? Well, Kaia Gerber of course. 
The model and actress (we're still living for her role in Bottoms, FYI) has had campaigns with fashion houses like AlaÃ¯a, Celine, DKNY and Alexander McQueen and magazine covers with Vogue, British Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, as well as opening for Valentino on the runway. She's basically the EGOT of the fashion world at this point.
Naturally, part of her success is due to her incred DNA: her mother is the OG supermodel Cindy Crawford, AKA one of the most beautiful women to have *ever* lived. And Kaia's fashion has previously paid homage to her famous mum: rocking a retro power suit at Paris Fashion Week last year which looked like it had been taken *straight* from Cindy's wardrobe.
And now, she's back on it. Kaia stepped out at the Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of Shell â€” a new film, featuring Kaia (natch!), which explores the perils of the beauty industry through dark comedy. 
On the red carpet, the supermodel rocked a white, ankle-length HervÃ© LÃ©ger bandage dress with in-built underwire cups with a pair of matching white stilettos by Jimmy Choo. Sounds gorge, right? 
Well, the look wasn't just beaut, it was also a major throwback to a look worn by her mother on another red carpet: the 1993 Academy Awards, to be exact. At that awards show, overly 30 years ago, Cindy wore basically the exact same dress by HervÃ© Leger â€” proving that some looks literally never go out of style.
