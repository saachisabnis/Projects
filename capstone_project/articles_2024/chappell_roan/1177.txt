Artisan Maria Guadalupe Velázquez beads jewelry during Tucson's annual Tucson Meet Yourself Folk Festival in Jácome Plaza in downtown Tucson on Oct. 11, 2019.
October is when temperatures start to drop and our favorite festivals come out of hiding. It's when spooky season emerges, bringing haunted houses and pumpkin patches to our favorite desert city. 
Could October be Tucson's busiest month? It's definitely a contender, and we know this list likely only scratches the surface. This month brings Tucson Meet Yourself, Cyclovia, spooky markets, film fests, plant sales and even a big community-wide sing-along.
Of course, things can change quickly these days. Check for the latest info before heading out!
