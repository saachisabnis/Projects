Halloween is on the way, are you ready for it …? A Louisiana home known for extravagant Halloween decorations, nicknamed the Skeleton House, certainly is. The home, owned by Louellen and Darryl Berger, has gone with a Taylor Swift theme this year. “Welcome to New Orleans Terror Swift The scERAS Tour,” a banner in their front yard reads.

Only time will tell if she pays a visit to her skeleton counterparts.
