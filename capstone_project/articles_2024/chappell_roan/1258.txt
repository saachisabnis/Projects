So close … Vermont’s bronze-medal winning Olympian Ilona Maher and her partner, Alan Bersten, finished second in Tuesday’s finale of Dancing With the Stars Season 33
The winners were Joey Graziadei and Jenna Johnson, receiving the highest combination of judges’ scores and viewers’ votes during the semi-finals and finals.
Chandler Kinney and Brandon Armstrong finished in third place, followed by Stephen Nedoroscik and Rylee Arnold in fourth and Danny Amendola and Witney Carson in fifth.

Maher, the Olympic rugby star, and Bersten performed two numbers in the finale: a jive to “Shake a Tail Feather” by Ray Charles & The Blues Brothers in the redemption round; and in the freestyle round, “Femininomenon” by Chappell Roan.
Hours before the finale, Maher posted pictures from throughout the season on Instagram. In the post’s description, she wrote “Lets leave it all on the dance floor tonight. Tune in at 8:00 p.m. EST to see us dance for the final time together.”
Five couples, including Maher and Bersten, will dance tonight on ABC.
