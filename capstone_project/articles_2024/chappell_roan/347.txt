Barack and Michelle Obama have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, according to a video released by Harris' campaign this morning. The endorsement caps a whirlwind week of campaigning for Harris. Yesterday, she reiterated her support for Israel after she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

U.S. authorities announced last night that he was arrested in El Paso, Texas. He will appear before an American judge soon.
