Simple? Never heard of it. 
The 2024 MTV Video Music Awards are officially here, people! And like pretty much every year, celebs are expected to turn the red carpet into a high-voltage runway of iconic fashion statements and standout looks that we can't not obsess over. From glitzy gowns to sleek co-ords, group â€˜fits, and Taylor Swift Easter eggs (obviously), thereâ€™s always a ton to look forward to at the highly-anticipated awards show, which kicks off tonight at the UBS Arena in New York.
Luckily, with a slew of famous faces set to be in attendanceâ€”ahem: hot girl coach/host Megan Thee Stallion, Sabrina Carpenter (!), Shawn Mendes (!!), Camila Cabello (!!!), Vanguard winner Katy Perry, Chappell Roan, Eminem, GloRilla, Halsey, Karol G, LL Cool J, and more!â€”thereâ€™s no doubt the red carpet fashion will be *chefâ€™s kiss*.
Now, all this ^^^ means the time has officially come to put on our finest pajamas and celebrate the heck out of tonightâ€™s 2024 VMAs looks (like, the good, the bad, and the worst). After all, thereâ€™s truly no better way to spend the thick of Fashion Month other than right in front of your computerâ€”notably not in glam...or couture...or any kind of acceptable footwear, honestlyâ€”and scrolling through the ~lewks~. Letâ€™s get into it, shall we?
