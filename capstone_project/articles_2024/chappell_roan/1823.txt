Chappell Roan made quite an impression on the red carpet on Friday night (October 25) at the Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour concert movie premiere—not only with her look but with a surprising confrontation.
The 26-year-old singer, while posing for photographers, spotted a familiar face in the crowd of cameras: a photographer she remembered for all the wrong reasons. In a video captured of the moment, Chappell points straight at the photographer before walking over to confront him about a past interaction that left her feeling disrespected.
“You were so disrespectful to me at the Grammys. You yelled at me at the Grammy party. Yes, you did, at the Universal, at the after party. I remember,” Chappell says firmly in the clip shared by Entertainment Weekly. She continued, “You were so rude to me. And I deserve an apology for that. Yeah, yep you do! No, no, no! You need to apologize to me. You need to apologize to me.”
The video quickly made waves online, sparking a flurry of reactions from fans. Many supported her direct approach, applauding her for standing up for herself in an industry where artists often face pressure to smile and keep quiet. For Chappell, who’s quickly becoming a voice for confidence and self-respect, this was another example of her unwillingness to accept mistreatment, no matter where she is or who’s watching.
Fans and other celebrities alike have praised her, noting the importance of accountability in public spaces and acknowledging the impact of her words. Moments like these underscore the need for mutual respect in the industry, especially as artists are increasingly speaking up about their experiences.
As Chappell continues to make waves in music and beyond, it’s clear she’s just as committed to advocating for herself as she is to her art—something her fans admire.
