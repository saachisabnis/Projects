The Kit Kats of Cabaret, photographed by Jenny Anderson.
For the 10 dancers, or Kit Kats, in the sexy and immersive new Broadway production of Cabaret, the show begins well before the opening number. Arrive at the August Wilson Theater an hour early, entering through a dark, makeshift alleyway, and you’ll catch one of them gyrating at your tabletop or coquettishly serving shots of Schnapps, underscoring the point that this is not your garden-variety night at the theater. One of the primary draws of this revival—directed by Rebecca Frecknall and starring Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee and Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles—is the set and costume design by Tom Scutt, who has brought the carnal underworld of early 1930s Berlin to life by essentially recreating the Kit Kat Club on 52nd Street. This approach makes the Kit Kats themselves an even more essential part of the production, responsible for not only depicting Germany’s gradual slide into fascism but cultivating the club’s wild sense of revelry before the fall. As the Tony Awards approach—the show is nominated in nine categories—we wanted to get know the cast a bit more intimately, so we asked them a series of cheeky questions. Read on to find out how to eat a Kit Kat (we mean the candy, of course).

FRITZIE/KOST | UNDERSTUDY FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER
How do you unwind after a show? This is a first for me, but I actually get to unwind DURING the show. Kost’s scenes and the Kit Kat dances I’m in are all in the first act, with the exception of “Kickline,” which opens the second act. But after that I take my makeup off, get ready to go because all I have is the final company moment. So I’m actually unwound by the time I get home.
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Health happiness love. 
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Damn I haven’t had a kit kat in a long time, maybe I’ll go get one.
What’s your favorite number from the show? I love watching “Money.” 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Don’t remember, but I can’t believe I haven’t been in a production ’til now. I’ve always had a Sally in me. But with this production, life saved the best for last, I guess.
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? My slip from the scene with my sailors and Bebe. It’s a gorgeous champagne color.
What could make you forget your lines? Extraneous noises. Being tired. 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? I’ll leave that to the experts. 
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: We all work really hard here and everyone is on point. No one above anyone else. It’s a super strong and loving and supportive company.
What’s your Sardi’s order? Whatever is the classic thing to experience on the menu.

FRENCHIE / UNDERSTUDY SALLY BOWLES
How do you unwind after a show? After a show, I love to have a good meal, take a bath and stretch while watching TikToks. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Probably seashells and flowers.
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Well, I have celiac disease… so Kit Kats are off limits (Kit Kat please make them gluten free!) But back in the day when I could eat Kit Kats…. definitely layer by layer. Dissect ’em! 
What’s your favorite number from the show? “Wilkommen”! 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? I played Sally Bowles at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts… with our Lulu, David Merino! Never did I ever think that 16-year-old Gabi would be on Broadway in the same show.. or even understudy the same role on Broadway years later!! Younger me is screaming!! 
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? I want the Emcee’s “Money” costume. It’s really fierce. 
What could make you forget your lines? The other day during my Sally put-in, there was a lot of haze onstage. I think the crew went a little smoke crazy! I couldn’t see my scene partner… that definitely made me forget my lines. But it was funny! 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? Celine Dion… ’cause I love a power ballad! Stevie Wonder…Ooo! A Disco musical! I want DRAMA! 
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: Colin Cunliffe. 
What’s your Sardi’s order? Sardi’s Shrimp Salad and maybe a Soup du Jour (if it’s gluten free).

HELGA
How do you unwind after a show? Usually turn on the original Broadway cast recording of The Notebook musical and roll out my body alongside my sistah, MiMi aka Texas. There’s sometimes a class of champagne or wine involved on my end as well. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? I’d say it’s the day to day things that keep me going. Like my puppy, Alfie. My bike, Lilith, that I love riding especially through Central Park. Blooming trees. Sunrises and sunsets. The things we see daily and sometimes miss, but that remind us that we’re living!
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Snap that baby in half and eat it one piece at a time. And if you disagree, I think that may be a sign of a psychopath. 
What’s your favorite number from the show? To perform? “Mein Herr,” for sure. You can tap into something different everyday with that number if you want. Some days there are tears and some days there is unhinged, evil laughter. It truly depends on the day. But to watch? I’d say Gayle’s “Cabaret” is one of the most captivating theatrical experiences of my life so like, that’s a winner.
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Watching the movie one day while I was working abroad in Australia. I rented it on Amazon Prime and had a movie night with myself. 
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? Sally’s pink/purple lingerie with her green fur coat that cost her everything she’s got. That’s it. That’s the look. I mean.. I feel it’s self-explanatory. 
What could make you forget your lines? I rarely do this *knocks on wood* but I always have a fear that I will, then something else just ends up happening. The fear pops in when a loved one or someone famous is in the audience. Recently, Patti Lupone was in the audience and I tripped up the stairs so. Instead of forgetting my lines, I forget simple things like how to walk. 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? Ok I hate to say this.. but Taylor Swift… the woman has quite the catalog full of stories!
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: Lulu (played by David Merino) is unstoppable and even if she missed her mark, she’d create her own and prove us wrong. 
What’s your Sardi’s order? I’ll just take a spicy margarita with a side of fries, please.

HANS | UNDERSTUDY ERNST LUDWIG & HERR SCHULTZ
How do you unwind after a show? I strip, sit, sigh, gulp some water, pour a drink and start stretching. I’m typically the last one to leave a dressing room. It’s one of my favorite parts and places of the show. Shout out to the awesome people working the stage door who support and understand the unwind. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Laughs with the ones that make your stomach sore. Balloons, confetti cannons, and whiskey.  
How do you eat a Kit Kat? I divide and slide. I split the chocolate wafer in half lengthwise. Then, a good combo of suck and nibble. I love my Kit Kats. 
What’s your favorite number from the show? Number 17. The Spread Eagle. That, and number 4. It’s the perfect balance of tenderness and kinky.
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? When I was 11 or 12, my mom drove me and three friends to Perry Mansfield, a performing arts camp in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to see their production of Cabaret. I’ll never forget the Emcee. I’ve never forgotten the Emcee.
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? All my Hans leather. The collar, the cuffs, and the harness. It’s the most beautiful brown leather that keeps molding with me throughout the run. It would be an honor to take it out for a walk. 
What could make you forget your lines? A patron that is super good-looking but clearly not paying attention. I’d get distracted, then pissed, and then turned on. That’s too much when I’m trying to do my job.
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? Robin Williams. It’s not a musical about him or his life but someone gathers all of his favorite songs and puts it into a show. Can that be a jukebox musical? Steven Hoggett is the director/choreographer and David Zinn designs. Nick Blaemire is the artistic consultant.  
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: It’s not a cast member but our company member and assistant stage manager Derek never misses. He literally saves our lives. That and team Gorilla. Eight of us perform an insanely delightful and precise costume change in the second act.  
What’s your Sardi’s order? A window seat, an extra cold dirty martini and a legendary Broadway story told by an elderly chorus homo.

VICTOR / UNDERSTUDY EMCEE
How do you unwind after a show? It’s a heavy show obviously, so the best way to unwind is to find moments of silliness and laughter. I’m thankful to share a dressing room with David (our Lulu), we make each other laugh a lot.  
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? I’m a dessert girlie for sure, so my favorite kind of party favor is something sweet, maybe thumbprint cookies or a dessert wine.
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Cheeky! We all have different preferences, you’ll have to come see the show and find out. [wink wink]
 What’s your favorite number from the show? “Don’t Tell Mama” is my favorite. I’m so jealous I’m not in that number. It’s our introduction to Gayle’s Sally, and the Kit Kats get to be unhinged sexy babies. 
 What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Aside from hearing the songs here and there growing up, my first real encounter with the material was in college, where I was the same track I am in this production: Victor/Emcee understudy, ha!
 Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? My standard Kit Kat costume is really fantastic. A lacy blue blouse and leather booty shorts? Chic, danceable, breathable. It’s a no-brainer.
 What could make you forget your lines? Julian, who plays Bobby, makes me break the most on stage, I’m sure if anything would make me forget a line it would be Julian. If I hear even a giggle from him I’m toast.
 Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? She’s only one album into her career, but I think Chappell Roan’s music would make the coolest, dreamiest, sapphic love story. Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl, the Musical. Sign me up. 
 Name one cast member that never misses their mark: I would say all of us are very consistent! Our show being in the round, with a lot of audience interaction, means each performance really feels different. We have to ebb and flow with the changes as a collective, and I think that speaks to our connection and preparedness as a cast.
 What’s your Sardi’s order? Their grilled angus burger is always a slay!

LULU / UNDERSTUDY EMCEE
How do you unwind after a show? It has to start during the show! The heaviness of act 2 can REALLY weigh me down, so I combat that with some lovin’ and shenanigans with my fellow Kit Kats. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? The bruises. The scars. The wrinkles. The memories.
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Split ‘em and dive in. Same goes for the candy, too. 
What’s your favorite number from the show? “Mein Herr” always feels like the cathartic thrashing that my body and being CRAVES living in this city and doing what we do every day. 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Senior year in high school, I got to do a production of Cabaret, and it changed my, at the time, incredibly limited perception of what musical theatre could be in an exhilarating way. Fun Fact: Gabi Campo and I were classmates and did the show together— she was Sally Bowles and I think I was Hans? Haha! 
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? My itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, green ombré, crocheted bikini.
What could make you forget your lines? The buffoonery that happens CONSTANTLY on and off stage. We’re feisty performers playing feistier performers—we get away with a lot. 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? Don’t we have enough of those? If the answer is no, then let’s go with Yebba because it would be a musical masterpiece. 
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: Gayle Rankin. Wow. Every single show, at the same point at the end of act 1, I watch her get so viscerally moved that she gets goose bumps from top to toe. Every. Single. Show. You can always count on her bumps to hit their mark when the show gets ooky-spooky.
What’s your Sardi’s order? I’ve never been, and it’s not really in my fast food and ramen budget, but I dream of a big ol’ steak…do they have that? Someone take me to Sardi’s, I’m hungry!

BOBBY / UNDERSTUDY CLIFF BRADSHAW
How do you unwind after a show? I’ve got an amazing Spring Spotify playlist that’s been on repeat after the show finishes! It’s currently giving Amapiano, House, and 80s Funk music. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Champagne bottles, custom champagne flutes, and Gucci Sunglasses.
How do you eat a Kit Kat? I split them in half. My cousins and I have done that since childhood, so I still rock it like that.
What’s your favorite number from the show? I love how everyone gets introduced in “Wilkommen.” It’s the best way to meet the ensemble and introduce all of the vibrant energy of the show. 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Sophomore year of College – I was a part of the Kit Kat Ensemble and had such a fun experience doing the show! Anything Kander and Ebb is always a great time.
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? My Bobby costume is pretty unstoppable. We are serving you Midnight Velvet Elongated Realness. 
What could make you forget your lines? Marty (Victor) and Colin (Hans) make me laugh so much every single day. I could totally see myself flubbing up lines after a backstage encounter with them. It might have already happened, to be honest. 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? Destiny’s Child!! Could you imagine?!? The “Survivor” dance break or “Lose My Breathe” chorus number would be legendary. Let’s get that going ASAP!!
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: Colin Cunliffe, our Hans. Always full out and committed. Truly inspiring. Love you, Sister!!
What’s your Sardi’s order? Espresso Martini, but with Casamigos Tequila.

TEXAS | UNDERSTUDY FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER
How do you unwind after a show? Usually cooling down, listening to The Notebook Cast Recording and laughing with my sis, Ayla. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Best Party favor is a treat of some sort! Cookies to take home are the way to my heart!
How do you eat a Kit Kat? Left then right, aka the best way! 
What’s your favorite number from the show? It’s a tie between the opening and “Mein Herr.” In the opening, I love introducing the audience to Texas and making them fall in love with her. In “Mein Herr,” I love releasing the day’s and sometimes life’s frustrations. It’s truly cathartic. 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? Seeing the movie and knowing I wanted to be as good as Liza one day! 
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? Oh, my Kit Kat costume. Tom Scutt designed it specifically for me for the Broadway run and it’s truly gorgeous. 
What could make you forget your lines? I’m very much like the character Doug from Up, so if an audience member is acting up I will very much get distracted. 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? 100% Laufey! Please cast me! 
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: David Merino. They’re truly a superstar in every sense of the word. I’m so lucky to dance next to them every night. 
What’s your Sardi’s order? French 75.

PAIGE SMALLWOOD (SHE/THEY) 
ROSIE | UNDERSTUDY SALLY
How do you unwind after a show? I have a Dog — Miss Onion — so the first thing I do when I get home is take her for a walk. It’s a nice way to let my body move naturally to release any stiffness or physical stress from the show, but it’s also wonderful to spend that time to just reconnect with my Dog after a long day. She’s always there to greet me with a big smile and a slobbery kiss. 
If life’s a cabaret, what are the party favors? Party hats, of course!! No, I think they would be the people you meet along the way and the experiences you share. The best things of life aren’t things at all. 
How do you eat a Kit Kat? I can’t… I’m lactose intolerant. 
What’s your favorite number from the show? PINEAPPLE!!! Bebe and Steven are absolutely magic together. But if I had to pick my favorite to perform, it would have to be “Mein Heir.” Julia’s Choreography is so raw, so primal, so powerful; and the support we as Kit Kats (Sally included) have for one another when it comes to the context of that number is palpable. It’s giving “You mess with my family, you mess with ME!” 
What was your first encounter with Cabaret? I’m pretty sure I heard the song “Maybe This Time” on a “Broadway’s Greatest Hits” album my mom put on in the car. I asked her about the show, she told me everything she could, and it was game over from there—I was hooked. But I had never seen it live! Not until after I booked this show and had the opportunity to see the production still mesmerizing audiences on the West End. It was a life-changing experience.
Which costume from the show are you wearing to the after-party? My base Rosie look, 1,000%. Tom’s designs are beyond stunning and uniquely us. I couldn’t stop smiling from the second I put on the finished look. It was so different than anything I had expected; different than anything I had seen in footage from other iterations of this show. And for those reasons, I absolutely adore it. 
What could make you forget your lines? Hopefully, nothing! I’ve forgotten my lines once before on stage when I was out touring with Les Mis. I was Eponine entering what we called the “mini barricade” at the top of act 2 and started speaking/singing gibberish to our poor Marius. I kind of blacked out to be honest and don’t remember how or why it happened. I got it back eventually, though! I remember that much! 
Which artist desperately needs a jukebox musical? “Weird Al” Yankovic! I know we got the historically accurate biopic last year with Daniel Radcliffe, but I think we also need a stage show; a live performance to really do his story justice. I hear Daniel is free in July, you think he’d be game? 
Name one cast member that never misses their mark: Marty Lauter 💜 They are so beautifully meticulous with their work; you should see their understudy tracking sheet! They are so regimented and so dedicated to perfecting every aspect of their show. It is truly something so aspire to. 
What’s your Sardi’s order? I’ve actually never been to Sardi’s! Do you have any dairy free recommendations?
