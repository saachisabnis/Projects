Adele spotted the pop legend in the crowd during the latest of her Caesars Palace residency shows
Adele burst into tears as she embraced Celine Dion during her latest Las Vegas show on Saturday (October 26) – check out the footage below.
The ‘Chasing Pavements’ singer was playing the latest in a run of shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, ironically a venue originally built for Dion’s 2003 residency. During a rendition of ‘When We Were Young’, Adele spotted the legendary diva in the crowd and promptly broke into tears.
The two singers reached across the barrier for an extended hug, with Dion kissing Adele’s hand and taking her seat again, before wiping away her own tears.
“Give it up for Miss Celine Dion,” said Adele. See fan-captured footage of the tender moment below.

Eight dates remain on the ‘Weekends With Adele’ run of Vegas shows, with the final coming on November 23. After that, the singer has said she will be going on an indefinite hiatus, which caused tickets for the final show to skyrocket in price, with some going for over £18,000.
Over the summer, Adele played a 10-date residency at the purpose-built Messe Munchen arena in Munich. During one show, she took a moment to praise Chappell Roan, calling the rising singer “absolutely amazing”. “She is spectacular, and it turns out, she’s not just got one song,” she said. “She’s got, like, seven fucking brilliant songs.”
She also confirmed her engagement to Rich Paul live on stage and performed her 2008 single ‘Chasing Pavements’ for the first time in seven years. At another gig, she paused the set to stream the semi-final and final of the women’s 100m Olympic races.
Celine Dion, meanwhile, sang a showstopping version of Edith Piaf’s ‘L’Hymne a L’Amour’ at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony in June, her first public performance since revealing her stiff person syndrome diagnosis in 2022.
