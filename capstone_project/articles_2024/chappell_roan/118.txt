We got another look at one of the most anticipated holiday specials of the year!
Sabrina Carpenter’s Nonsense Christmas on Netflix won’t be out for a couple of weeks, but w=e know a little more about it now. Chappell Roan, Shania Twain and more will sing duets with Sabrina for the show which comes out on December 6th!
Maybe we’ll even get a guest appearance straight from DoMiNgOoOo!
