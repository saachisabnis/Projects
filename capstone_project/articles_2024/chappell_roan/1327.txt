Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department is No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart for the 11th consecutive week. TTPD has tied 1989 and Fearless for Swift’s albums that have spent the most total weeks at No. 1. 1989 was also the last album by a woman to spend 11 weeks at No. 1 in 2014-15. TTPD also becomes the first album by a woman to spend 11 weeks in a row at No. 1 since Whitney Houston’s soundtrack to The Bodyguard spent 13 straight weeks at No. 1 in 1992-93. Also in the Billboard 200 Top 5, Megan Thee Stallion’s Megan debuts at No. 3, while Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moves up to No. 2, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft stays at No. 4, and Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess reaches the top five for the first time at No. 5. This marks the first time in over a year that there are four albums by women in Billboard’s Top 5. (Billboard)
