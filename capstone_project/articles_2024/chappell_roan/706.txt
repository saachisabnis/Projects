Ian O’Connor has five books under his belt, including four New York Times best-sellers that have explored the lives and careers of legendary athletes. Now, the prolific writer is adding a sixth to his oeuvre. Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers is said to be the “definitive portrait” of the (in)famous quarterback who makes just as many headlines off the field as he does on it. While O’Connor hopes the book will be his fifth best-seller, one Twitter user sees a different future for the biography: a fantasy league punishment. 
But the cruel and unusual torture of being forced to read about the Jets play caller was hardly the only sting-worthy burn this week. Others included those about a guy with four ovens, Chappell Roan’s fanbase and someone who looks like an imaginary friend.
