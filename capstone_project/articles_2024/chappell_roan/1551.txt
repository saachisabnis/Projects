If I had to pick my all-time favorite holiday, it’s hands down Halloween. I spend months planning my costume and perfecting my makeup look. This year, I’m dressing up as Chappell Roan, which entails all the sequins and heavy, drag queen-inspired makeup you can imagine.
Normally, the amount of makeup I’m wearing would take hours to remove with plain ‘ole micellar water (okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but it would take forever!). Luckily, I found a skin-saving product to melt my heavy Halloween makeup in seconds. It’s the Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm — and I can’t name a harder working makeup remover to snatch ahead of the big holiday!

Cleansing balms have been a staple in South Korea for years. As K-beauty has become more popular here in the U.S., people have been ditching their irritating makeup removers for these calming yet effective formulas. The rich texture of cleansing balms — which are chock full of nourishing butters and oils — replenishes skin while quite literally melting makeup.
Instead of that dry, stripped feeling that’s often caused by micellar water or makeup wipes, cleansing balms leave skin feeling more hydrated and supple. The Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm happens to be the top-selling cleansing balm in all of South Korea — and it’s clear why.
I find this cleansing balm to be more enjoyable to use than standard face washes. Instead of wetting my face from the jump, I massage a dollop of the balm onto my dry skin and watch all my makeup dissolve in seconds. It’s so satisfying to see my foundation, blush and even waterproof mascara break down in front of my eyes.
I rarely need to double cleanse after one go, but my extra Halloween makeup might require two rinses. Still, even with a double cleanse, washing my face with this cleansing balm is less aggravating than wasting dozens of cotton pads trying to wipe away every last trace of makeup.
Nearly 10,000 Amazon shoppers agree this is the best makeup remover they’ve ever used.
“This cleansing balm has completely transformed my skincare routine, making the tedious task of removing makeup a delightful experience,” one reviewer writes. “The formula effortlessly melts away all traces of makeup, including stubborn waterproof mascara and long-lasting lipstick, without any tugging or irritation. It’s like magic in a tub! It’s efficient, gentle, and leaves my skin feeling pampered. If you’re on the hunt for a makeup remover that feels like a spa treatment, look no further.”
It’s not too late to get the Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm just in time for Halloween festivities. And if you have Amazon Prime, it will arrive in two days — just in time for all your spooky adventures on the October 31. Don’t delay, or your removing your Halloween makeup will be a serious fright!
