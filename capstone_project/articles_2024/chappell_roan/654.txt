Chappell Roan recently performed on Saturday Night Live, and in true Chappell fashion — there were a few great fashion moments! Including a burlesque-inspired outfit that took 500 HOURS to create!
Now, if you do the math (and don't sleep and do nothing but sew), that's almost 21 DAYS. The look's designer, Project Runway album Gunna Deatherage, shared in detail how the outfit came to life and the inspiration behind it. On TikTok, in a behind-the-scenes video of putting together the outfit, Gunnar explained, "It feels so surreal to be releasing this garment! It was an incredible labor of love, and it took a full month of 18 hour days to make it happen!"
So, if you do even more math, if this look took 500 hours to make, and a full month of 18 hour days, you're looking at almost 28 days! 
In an interview with PEOPLE, Deatherage explained of designing the burlesque-inspired look, "As we kept building and the look kept evolving and getting cooler and more complex, it was apparent that this look needed to be seen in a more stationary moment, rather than jumping around on stage. Because the last thing we wanted to do is prohibit Chappell from being able to be Chappell on stage — prohibit the magic."
Take a look at what it took to put together Chappell's SNL look below.
