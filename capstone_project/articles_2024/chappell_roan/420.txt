Sabrina Carpenter had a very special guest during her latest Short n’ Sweet Tour stop.
Throughout the tour, Carpenter, 25, has established a tradition of arresting audience members for being “too hot” before performing her song “Juno.” Celebs including Millie Bobby Brown and Rachel Sennott have been part of the bit, but the pop star got flirty with a fictional character during her Sunday, November 17, show at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California.
When Carpenter’s “Too Hot” cam fell on Marcello Hernández, he addressed the singer as Domingo, his overtly flirtatious character from a viral Saturday Night Live skit.
“Sabrina, I’m here,” Hernández, 27, said, prompting thunderous applause from the crowd.
Carpenter noted that she was “so flustered” by Domingo’s charm and told him “I wish you were from my bedroom” instead of Miami.
“I’m the cute boy with the blue jacket and the thick accent,” Hernández said, nodding to a lyric from Carpenter’s song “Bed Chem.” He then reprised the parody of Carpenter’s hit tune “Espresso” which was featured in the SNL sketch that introduced audiences to Domingo.
“Came all this way, had to explain, direct from Domingo / Sabrina’s a friend, she’s like my sis, but I would hook up though,” he sang, prompting Carpenter to cover her mouth as she giggled.
The Domingo sketch, which is titled “Bridesmaid Speech,” has racked up over 11 million views on YouTube since it aired on SNL last month. Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman and host Ariana Grande starred as bridesmaids performing an “Espresso” parody that gradually revealed the bride (Chloe Fineman) had cheated on her husband (Andrew Dismukes) with a sexy stranger named Domingo during her Bachelorette trip.
Domingo was so popular with audiences that he made a comeback during the Saturday, November 16, episode. Host and musical guest Charli XCX joined Gardner, 41, Nwodim, 36, and Sherman, 31, for a riff on Chappell Roan’s song “HOT TO GO!”
“D-O-M-I-N-G-O, Kelsey’s texting Domingo,” the group sang at Kelsey’s baby shower, outing their pregnant pal’s extramarital activities during a girls trip.
“Domingo gonna be in your life forever, we’ll raise our babies in Miami together,” Hernández sang after Kelsey’s friends revealed through song that Domingo and her husband each fathered one of her twins.
Sherman recalled the moment that everyone realized how funny the OG Domingo sketch was during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this month.

“The writers — Jimmy Fowlie, Ceara O’Sullivan, Sudi Green [and] Allie Levitan — they wrote the sketch, and everyone’s laughing, we’re loving it,” said Sherman, who has been an SNL cast member since 2021. “And then, when Ariana Grande did bad singing at blocking rehearsal? Everyone was like, ‘Ohhhh … This is funny!'”
Sherman noted that while Grande’s performance was impressive since “all she does is sing on key” normally, it was less of a stretch for her.
“Everyone was like, ‘Oh, my God, you were so funny, Sarah, at bad singing,’” she recalled. “And I was like, ‘I was trying my best!'”
