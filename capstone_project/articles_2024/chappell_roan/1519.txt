"Words will never sum up what you mean to me, or what you coming to my show means"
Adele has spoken out about Celine Dion following their tearful meeting at the ‘Hello’ singer’s recent show in Las Vegas.
This past Saturday (October 26) the ‘Chasing Pavements’ singer was playing the latest in a run of shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace –  a venue originally built for Dion’s 2003 residency. During a rendition of ‘When We Were Young’, Adele spotted the legendary diva in the crowd and promptly broke into tears.
Now, Adele has taken to her official Instagram account to share a photo of the emotional meeting and discussed the significance of the moment for her. “I have been performing in Celine Dion’s room at the Colosseum for almost 2 years now. 4 weeks to go! It was the only venue I wanted to play in Vegas because it was built for her,” began the caption of the post.

She continued: “I have a picture of her right next to the stage that I touch every night before I walk on and she came to the show this weekend and it was a surprise and it was a MOMENT!! @celinedion I love you so very very much. Words will never sum up what you mean to me, or what you coming to my show means, let alone how it felt seeing you back in your palace with your beautiful family.
“I have loved being there it has been such an honour and Saturday night will be something I remember forever and ever. Such a full circle moment for me to be there with you. Thank you so much.”

Eight dates remain on the ‘Weekends With Adele’ run of Vegas shows, with the final coming on November 23. After that, the singer has said she will be going on an indefinite hiatus, which caused tickets for the final show to skyrocket in price, with some going for over £18,000.
Over the summer, Adele played a 10-date residency at the purpose-built Messe Munchen arena in Munich. During one show, she took a moment to praise Chappell Roan, calling the rising singer “absolutely amazing”. “She is spectacular, and it turns out, she’s not just got one song,” she said. “She’s got, like, seven fucking brilliant songs.”
She also confirmed her engagement to Rich Paul live on stage and performed her 2008 single ‘Chasing Pavements’ for the first time in seven years. At another gig, she paused the set to stream the semi-final and final of the women’s 100m Olympic races.
Celine Dion, meanwhile, sang a showstopping version of Edith Piaf’s ‘L’Hymne a L’Amour’ at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony in June, her first public performance since revealing her stiff person syndrome diagnosis in 2022.
