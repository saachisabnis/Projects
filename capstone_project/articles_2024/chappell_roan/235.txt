Chappell Roan is one of the most talked about artists on the planet right now, and her meteoric rise has been tough to cope with—especially when it comes to receiving harassment from fans. The 26-year-old pop star spoke about her qualms with fame during an interview with The Face, sharing that she sought advice from another famous singer who knows all about skyrocketing into stardom: Lorde.
Roan recalled texting the "Royals" star for advice while crying in an airport bathroom. “She sent me a list of things I should do. Literally wrote down eight things she wished someone would have told her when she was going through it," she said. "And she went through f***ing hell. She was a baby!”
Lorde was only 16 years old when her critically acclaimed debut album Pure Heroine was released in 2013 and catapulted her into the spotlight.
Elsewhere in the interview, Roan confessed that the dangers of fame have made her consider quitting music. "I told myself, if this ever gets dangerous, I might quit," she said after telling a story about how two men followed her around the airport and berated her for refusing to sign a poster. "It's dangerous now, and I'm still going. But that part is not what I signed up for."
