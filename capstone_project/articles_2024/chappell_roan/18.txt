Bowen Yang is a man of so many talents and characters onÂ Saturday Night Live, and in the Season 50 premiere, he took on a new one: Moo Deng, the super-mega-viral baby pygmy hippo that turned into so many great memes and TikTok videos.
This version of Moo Deng is tired of performing and needs some boundaries ... but then he gets he with water from a hose multiple times and the hilarity really begins -- just check out how Colin Jost reacts. Even Yang broke for a second when food got thrown at him. And there's a Chappell Roan joke too.
Check out the video and enjoy:
