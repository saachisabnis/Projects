Chappell Roan has angered fans as she revealed that she is cancelling some of her European shows – just days before they were set to take place.
Fans are furious as the Red Wine Supernova singer, 26, took to social media to reveal that she had decided to cancel two concert dates and reschedule another just days before they were set to take place.
‘Due to scheduling conflicts, I have had to make the extremely hard decision to cancel my Paris and Amsterdam shows.
‘I have rescheduled my Berlin show to 23 September. I am so sorry & very disappointed :( I promise I will be back. I’m heartbroken.
Thank you for understanding,’ she said in a post.
She then added: ‘Ticket holders for Paris and Amsterdam – refund will come from point of purchase. Berlin, your tickets will be automatically transferred over to the new date.’
Although she thanked fans for understanding, many took to social media to say they did not understand and were confused as to how a scheduling conflict could arise when the performances are just days away and when the concerts has been planned for months.
The star also did not clarify exactly what the scheduling conflict was – leading to only further speculation and disappointment from fans.

The singer’s Berlin performance was scheduled for Saturday evening, with a Paris performance set to take place on September 3, and an Amsterdam gig scheduled for September 4.
Although she has rescheduled the Berlin performance, many fans highlighted that they had already flown to the German city for the gig and were now still stuck paying for a hotel and flight for no reason.
‘We’ve booked flights and a hotel, flying tomorrow from the UK to Berlin. Not cool at all. Hundreds of pounds wasted,’ said Domsims on X.
‘I’m literally at the airport right NOW cause I was supposed to come to your Berlin date. I’m so extremely disappointed, next time maybe don’t share this information this late,’ Destineddeath99 added.
girl berlin should be in two days?? sorry change your planning team.. this is not the first time this has happened and now i can pay a lot of money again..  also im so so sorry for those whose shows was cancelled. That’s not okay.
‘I’m literally sitting in my hotel lobby in BERLIN!!! 48 hrs notice !!! Seriously!!! After spending thousands to come see you basically no-show! 48 hrs your fans are already here waiting this is devastating I can’t believe you did this,’ David_sfxxx said.

Some fans did leap to the singer’s defence asking fans to be more understanding.
‘I’m so sorry for all of those who are affected. I can’t imagine the disappointment and flood of emotions you’re feeling. However, this happens. It sucks. Truly. But it’s not chappells fault. I’m sure she doesn’t make her schedule. Please try to be understanding,’ StacyPfaehler commented.
The Good Luck, Babe singer singer has amassed huge success over the past few months after several of her songs took off on TikTok, but this latest cancellation is not the first time the singer has upset fans.
In July, the singer once again blamed ‘scheduling conflicts’ as she pulled out of another German performance.
‘Due to some scheduling shifts, I’ve had to jump out of the lineups for Superbloom and Lollapalooza Berlin. Wanted to make sure I see my German fans so I’m adding a headline show in Berlin at Columbiahalle on 31 August to kick off my EU tour!!’ she said in July in a social media post.
The singer also recently ruffled feathers after she blasted ‘predatory behaviour’ by fans that left her ‘scared and creeped out’, and called some fans out for trying to hug her.
