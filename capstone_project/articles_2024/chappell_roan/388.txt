(TND) â€” Chappell Roan made her first appearance on the red carpet for the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards and had a heated exchange while posing for photos.
While on the carpet, a photographer yelled at the singer to "Shut the f--- up" as she was showcasing her dress for the night.
Immediately, Roan turned to the photographer, pointing her finger and replied, "You shut the f--- up."
After the exchange, Roan explained the situation to Entertainment Tonight.
This tense exchange comes after Roan has accused fans of harassment and stalking in a social media post.
Even though the beginning of the night started tense, she later won her first VMA for "Best New Artist".
