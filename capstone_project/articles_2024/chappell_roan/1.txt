Vice President Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), are hoping to cash in on the success from their camo hat merchandise by releasing similar beer can holders.
“We have camo [for legal reasons we must call these ‘can coolers’] now,” Rob Flaherty, the campaign’s deputy manager, said in a post on social media.
The can cooler is being sold for $15 on the campaign website and is made in the United States by a union.
The camo printed holder is branded with the same orange “Harris Walz” lettering that helped the campaign sell nearly $1 million in hats.
Earlier this week, after Harris announced Walz as her running mate, the campaign launched the hat. The campaign said it originally printed 3,000 caps, which sold out in less than 30 minutes.
In the announcement video where Harris tapped Walz as her vice presidential pick, the Minnesota governor is seen wearing a camo hat.
Users online picked up on the hat and began calling him a “Midwest Princess,” a nod to pop singer Chappell Roan’s merchandise. The artist’s hat reads “Midwest Princess” in orange font on a camo background.
The campaign said the inspiration for the hat came from the governor himself. They came up with the idea as soon as the announcement video was shared, and he was wearing the print.
Walz shared a photo of himself wearing the hat Tuesday evening after joining Harris for his first rally in Philadelphia.
