The lineup has been unveiled for the upcoming Outside Lands Festival, taking place Aug. 9–11 at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California.
Now in its 16th year, the festival will include performances by Sturgill Simpson, who is returning for his first full show in three years, as well as Tyler the Creator and The Killers. Post Malone will also return to the Outside Lands main stage to perform a special country set.

Also coming back for 2024 is Dolores,’ an inclusive dance floor where everyone is welcome. The space aims to be a celebration of queer and trans communities. The full lineup for Dolores’ will be announced in the coming months.
Soma, the festival’s techno stage, will return with a new, open-air format and an expanded dance space featuring performances from Idris Elba, Uncle Waffles, The Blessed Madonna and Shiba San B2B CID, among others.
“Every year we start with a blank canvas and because of the diverse and sophisticated palette of Bay Area music fans, we get to program a festival that is not only multigenerational but shows an incredible range of genres and musical subcultures,” says Allen Scott, Co-Founder of Outside Lands and Head of Concerts & Festivals at Another Planet Entertainment.
