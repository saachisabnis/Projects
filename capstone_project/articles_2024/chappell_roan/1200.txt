	The clouds above Germany’s open-air venue Messe München heard the Adele deep cut “Cry Your Heart Out” and took her up on it. During the singer’s latest show in her Munich concert residency on Wednesday, pouring rain fell from the sky for a stretch of the performance.

	Adele adapted quickly, switching into a pair of sneakers to avoid slipping on the massive stage. 80,000 people watched along as she performed “Oh My God” from her most recent album, 30, while strutting around the stage. “Get your camera off my trainers,” she told the crowd. “Who just said nice shoes? Stop making fun of me.” The audience covered up with ponchos, more or less welcoming the rain.

	The singer also realized that if the weather kept up, she could use it to her advantage. “If it stops raining when I do ‘Set Fire to the Rain,’ I’m going to be fucking furious,” Adele joked. The rain did get lighter as the night went on. “Oh My God” was the eighth song in the setlist, while “Set Fire to the Rain” appeared eight songs after that. It was more drizzle than downpour by the time she reached it, but the droplets, paired with her fiery pyrotechnics, made for a cinematic performance.

	










	The show marked Adele’s fifth in a run of 10 shows at the venue, which was “exclusively created for these special shows,” according to her official website. “This is my fifth show, and five is my lucky number,” she told the audience. “So even though it’s pouring with rain, this is actually the most fun I’m having out of all the shows so far.”

	In between songs and quips about the weather, Adele kept up her usual banter and candor with the audience. She also confirmed that Chappell Roan is, in fact, your favorite artist’s favorite artist. “I went down a rabbit hole on Monday all day long. She is spectacular,” Adele said. “She has like seven fucking brilliant songs. I think she’s absolutely amazing. I’m very excited for her.”

	Beyond her praise, Adele shared a piece of advice for Roan in case she was somewhere listening. “But my friend also said she’s a bit scared,” she said, nodding to the rising star’s recent comments about feeling overwhelmed by her quick trajectory. “Do what you gotta do, baby girl. But you’re phenomenal.”
