During a recent show on her Munich residency, Adele took a moment to praise Chappell Roan and gave her some advice.
After wrapping up an extended residency in Las Vegas, Adele is currently in the midst of a run of shows in Munich. During a recent show, she took a moment to give Chappell Roan her flowers, adding that all she has done this week is discover her music.
"Chappell Roan is her name. I heard her song a little while ago at my birthday, and I loved it. It was one of my friend's playlists, and I went down a rabbit hole on Monday, all day long," Adele revealed. "She is spectacular, and it turns out â€“ she's not got one song, she's got like seven fucking brilliant songs! I think she's absolutely amazing. I'm very excited for her. My friend said she's a bit scared, so do what you've gotta do baby girl, you're phenomenal."
