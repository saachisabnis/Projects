In the current cover story of The Face, Chappell Roan shares specific incidents of invasive fan behavior that have caused her to question if wants to be in the public spotlight in the future. “I told myself, if this ever gets dangerous, I might quit,” Roan said. “It’s dangerous now, and I’m still going. But that part is not what I signed up for.” Roan says her newfound fame has brought with it stalkers, online abuse, and obsessive fans who “won’t leave you alone, yelling at you in public. I didn’t know it would feel this bad.” Roan reached out to Lorde following a disturbing interaction with a fan, and the 27-year-old New Zealand pop star shared useful advice. “She sent me a list of things I should do [that] she wished someone would have told her when she was going through it,” Roan revealed. “And she went through f—ing hell. She was a baby!” (People)
