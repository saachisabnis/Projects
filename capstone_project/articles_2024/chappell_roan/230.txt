Music Festival Lineup Reveal season is officially in full swing, so much so that while we were hyping Boston Calling’s 2024 lineup yesterday (January 9), another mega-fest went live with its own goods. That would be Tennessee’s Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, which goes down this year June 13 to 16 at the Bonnaroo Farm, situated roughly 60 miles southeast of Nashville in the city of Manchester.
Bonnaroo boasts more than 150 performances across 10 stages over its four days of music, and leading the headliner charge this year are the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Post Malone, Fred again.., and Pretty Light, who pull double-duty — first headlining the What Stage on Thursday, and then performing a “sunrise set” later in the weekend.  
Also playing the ‘Roo are Megan Thee Stallion, Cage The Elephant, IDLES, Maggie Rogers, Melanie Martinez, Chappell Roan, The Beaches, Khruangbin, Cigarettes After Sex, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, Diplo, Carly Rae Jepsen, Fisher, Jon Batiste, Dominic Fike, Parcels, GWAR, Joey Bada$$, Lizzy McAlpine, T-Pain, Interpol, Joe Russo’s Almost Dead, Two Friends, Taking Back Sunday, Baby Queen, Reneé Rapp, Gary Clark Jr, TV Girl, Thundercat, Ashnikko, Brittany Howard, and way more. There’s also the “Once More With Feeling(s) – The Dashboard Confessional Emo SuperJam” on Saturday.   
A pre-sale for tickets starts Thursday (January 11) via bonnaroo.com/tickets, and a public on-sale will follow if any tickets remain. Hit the link for prices and tiers.
