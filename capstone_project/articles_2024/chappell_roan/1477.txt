We are in the swing of summer, full of blazing heat and humidity and trips to the beach. That also means it's time for the summer anthems, and there are a lot of candidates this year. We've picked seven of our favorites for this year, ranging from a TikTok ear worm to Kendrick Lamar's takedown of Drake.
This summer belongs to the ladies, however, with two -- Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan -- each earning a pair of spots on this list. Roan has burst onto the scene with incredible vocals and catchy lyrics, while Carpenter followed up one massively popular single with a somehow even more popular one.
And of course, what would this list be without the one and only Taylor Swift. The song "I Can Do It With A Broken Heart" has been rumored to be the second single off of The Tortured Poets Department, so it's likely we'll hear a lot more of it over the next few months.
Let's get to the list.
If you've been on TikTok in the last two months, you've likely heard this bop created by user @girl_on_couch. It's simple, she is looking for a man in finance. Trust fund. Six-five. Blue Eyes. It has since been remixed and meme'd, but it is undeniably a song that will hang out in your head.
