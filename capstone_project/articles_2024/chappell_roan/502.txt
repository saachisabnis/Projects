“Don’t hate the player, hate the game”
Lily Allen has claimed that she now makes more money from her OnlyFans feet pics account than she does from Spotify.
The singer launched the subscription account in July, which people can choose to join for a monthly fee of $10 (£8). She posts images and videos of her feet on the service, and now she says that the income stream from it has overtaken what she earns each month from Spotify.
She posted on X that she “hasn’t posted in a while but you can still check out the archive”, to which another user responded by questioning why she has been “reduced to this”.
Allen quote-tweeted the response, and replied: “Imagine being [an] artist and having nearly 8 million monthly listeners on Spotify but earning more money from having 1000 people subscribe to pictures of your feet.”

“Don’t hate the player, hate the game,” she added.
A report from Infinite Catalog earlier this year calculated that Spotify pays approximately $0.003 per individual stream, and that money would then have to be divided between the artist, the publishers and the owners of the recording masters.
Allen revealed on her Miss Me? podcast in the summer that her venture into the world of OnlyFans was the result of a conversation she had with her nail technician.
“I have a lady that comes and does my nails,” she told co-host Miquita Oliver. “They informed me that I have five stars on WikiFeet, which is quite rare. My feet are rated quite highly on the internet.”
Shortly after launching the page, Allen said she had received an “eye-opening” response. “I’ve had a lot of disparaging, you know, horrible messages in my DMs,” she said. “I’m talking really personal, nasty.”
“It seems to me what I’m taking from these, mainly men, is that women should only really be selling images of herself or access to her body when it is an absolute last resort.”
“I think its a socio-economic issue in a lot of ways, the fact that I’m making money from this podcast and that I’m in a relationship – which by the way my husband happens to support the choices that I make – and I have kids means that I shouldn’t you know be “stooping so low” as to be profiting from my own body.”
Elsewhere, Allen said earlier this month that she “can’t imagine” doing a 20th anniversary tour for her 2006 debut album ‘Alright, Still’. “That person singing those songs is a relative child,” she explained.
She also recently came out in support of Chappell Roan for “changing the landscape” around fan behaviour and personal boundaries for artists, noting that her husband, Stranger Things actor David Harbour, had experienced a “palpable” change in people approaching him on the street since Roan spoke out.
