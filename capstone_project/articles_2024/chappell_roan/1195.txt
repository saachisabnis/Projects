Chappell Roan took to Instagram on Saturday (November 30) to celebrate her hit single, “Good Luck, Babe!” surpassing one billion streams on Spotify. “Good Luck, Babe!” was released as a standalone single on April 5, 2024, and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The 3x-platinum certified track was recently nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance at the forthcoming 67th Annual Grammy Awards. “Good luck babe hitting a billion streams on Spotify is cuckoo loco,” Chappell captioned her post. “All I have to say is thank you. ♡” Roan worked on “Good Luck, Babe!” with Justin Tranter and her longtime producer and collaborator Dan Nigro, with the pop superstar admitting to Rolling Stone, “The song was a b**ch to write.” “I just wanted to write a big anthemic pop song,” she continued,” revealing that it’s “about wishing good luck to someone who’s denying fate.” (Billboard)
