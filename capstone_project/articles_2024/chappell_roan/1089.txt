On the latest episode of the Comment Section podcast with Drew Afualo, Chappell Roan spoke about her meteoric rise to fame, and how her newfound success has her feeling freaked out. Roan’s debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, currently sits at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, while her hit new song, “Good Luck, Babe!” cracked the Top 10 on the Hot 100 singles’ chart last week. Roan’s music is clearly resonating with her growing fanbase, but some fans have taken things too far. 
“People have started to be freaks — like, [they] follow me and know where my parents live, and where my sister works. All this weird sh*t,” Roan revealed. “A few years ago, I said that if [there were] stalker vibes or my family was in danger, I would quit. And we’re there. I’ve pumped the brakes on, honestly, anything to make me more known. It’s kind of a forest fire right now. I’m not trying to go do a bunch of sh*t.” (NME)
