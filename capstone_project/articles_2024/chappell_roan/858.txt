Woohoo! Saturday Night Live is all new on Saturday, November 2, 2024, and if you're wondering who's hosting and the musical guest as Season 50 (!) continues, you've come to the right place.
The host would be John Mulaney, who continues to be one of the funniest people on the planet. As for musical guest? That would be Chappell Roan, making her debut.
There you have it! Enjoy SNL -- it's the fifth show of this season, in case you didn't know! -- and here's a promo featuring them both making a bunch of funny jokes, as is the tradition leading up to Saturday night's show:
