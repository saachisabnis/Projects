St Albans-based band, Enter Shikari, are set for a main stage return at one of the UK's most famousÂ festivals.


  The rockÂ group are going to light up the crowd at Reading and Leeds Festival in 2025, just sixÂ years on from their slot on the BBC Introducing music stage.


  They join Becky Hill and Conan Gray as sub-headliners to Bring Me the Horizon on the Sunday at Leeds FestivalÂ and Saturday at Reading Festival.

  In what has been a sharp rise to fame, Enter Shikari have put St Albans on the map through their music, always sticking to their roots and supporting the community - alsoÂ sponsoring St Albans City football club.


  All four members,Â Chris Batten, Rou Reynolds, Rob Rolfe and Rory Clewlow, went to school in the area and three still live in the city.


  Currently, 637,000 people listen to the band's tracks on Spotify every month with their most famous hit 'Sorry You're Not a Winner' garnering over 37 million playbacks.

  TheyÂ will now brush shoulders with the likes of Travis Scott,Â Hozier andÂ Chappell RoanÂ at next summer's iconic festivals.


  This is not unfamiliar territory for Shikari, as theirÂ last main stage appearance was 2022, whenÂ they played hits like '{The Dreamer's Hotel}' and 'THE GREAT UNKNOWN'.


  A taste of what attendees can expect is below:


  The announcement comes three weeks after the release of their latest LP 'Dancing On The Frontline', featuring multiple BBC live sessions and concerts.


  Reading and Leeds Festival will take place on the August Bank Holiday Weekend (August 21 to 24, 2025)Â with the first wave of tickets releasing at noon on Monday, December 9.
