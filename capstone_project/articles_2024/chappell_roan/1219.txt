Tyra Banks is back in the running toward becoming America’s next top Victoria’s Secret runway model.
The former Victoria’s Secret Angel and host of “America’s Next Top Model” will return to walk in the lingerie giant’s reinstated fashion show, set to take place in New York City on Oct. 15.
Banks, 50, and fellow Angel Gigi Hadid announced the news via a cheeky Instagram video Wednesday, which showed the latter, 29, donning a sparkly silver minidress and strutting into the lobby of a luxe hotel.
Behind the front desk was Banks, whose back was turned to show off her black silk letterman jacket that read, “Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2024.”
Hadid tapped the bell, but Banks was too busy sorting through invitations to the runway event.
After Hadid tapped the bell a second time, Banks flipped her long, caramel hair to turn and face the blond beauty.
At that moment, Chappell Roan’s “Femininomenon” started to play.
The “Tyra Banks Show” alum then flashed her signature “smize,” handed Hadid a gold envelope containing the coveted invite and said, “See ya there.”
Starstruck, Hadid mouthed, “Thank you” and “I love you,” before walking away.
The snippet was captioned, “Sorry, couldn’t write a caption, we were too busy picking up our jaws off the floor at @tyrabanks and @gigihadid delivering VSFS invites. You understand. #VSFashionShow.”
Banks — who walked in nine fashion shows during her tenure with the brand, last one being in 2005 — commented, “What we really need is a femininomenon! 💛,” adding in a second remark, “Serving…and delivering Tyra Mail! iykyk 👀💛.” 
Hadid, for her part, walked in three shows for the company, not including last year’s “Victoria’s Secret: The Tour ’23.”
The annual catwalk event — which began in 1995 — was canceled in 2019 amid criticism that Victoria’s Secret’s products and models were not inclusive enough.
However, the brand revamped and came back in September 2023 with a reimagined Prime Video special that featured more diversified women wearing more diversified garments in different cities around the world.
The retailer’s return to the traditional format “will deliver precisely what our customers have been asking for — the glamour, runway, fashion, fun, wings, entertainment — all through a powerful, modern lens reflecting who we are today,” a spokesperson for the company told Page Six Style in May.
Banks and Hadid will be joined by Imaan Hammam, Candice Swanepoel, Grace Elizabeth, Devyn Garcia, Paloma Elsesser, Taylor Hill and Mayowa Nicholas, among others.
