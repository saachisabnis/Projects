A resurfaced post Chappell Roan made years ago proves that she's got a way of making her wildest dreams come true.
The "Femininomenon" singer made her Saturday Night Live debut as the musical guest for the November 2 episode, and it was apparently a long time coming for the 26-year-old musician, per People. Prior to taking the iconic stage, Roan, whose real name is Kayleigh Amstutz, took to her Instagram to share an old Facebook status post she made in April 2011 about her desire to perform on the legendary sketch comedy show, underscoring how much of a full-circle moment it is for the rising star.
"I am determined to be on SNL," the post reads. She also shared photos from the lead-up to the big show, including one snap of her wearing an eye-popping outfit next to host John Mulaney. 
The "Good Luck, Babe!" phenom made the dream a reality over the weekend when she sang two tracks during the show, and, as evidenced by her fiery performance at the VMAs in September, she didn't hold back on the set design and costumes. 
In addition to performing her popular song "Pink Pony Club" from her debut studio album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, per People, Roan premiered a brand new country-inspired track called "The Giver."
