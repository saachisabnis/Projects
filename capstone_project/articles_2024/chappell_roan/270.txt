Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet notches its third consecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Short n’ Sweet is only the second album to spend its first three weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart in 2024, joining Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department, which also spent its first three weeks at No. 1 back in April and May on its way to a total of 15 nonconsecutive weeks on top of the charts. The rest of the Billboard 200 Top 5 remains the same as last week, with Post Malone’s F-1 Trillion at No. 2, Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess at No. 3, Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time at No. 4, and Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department at No. 5. The only debut appearance in this week’s Top 10 is former Pink Floyd member David Gilmour’s first studio album in nine years, Luck and Strange, coming in at No. 10. (Billboard)
