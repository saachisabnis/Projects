Shaboozey was last night’s musical guest on Saturday Night Live, where he performed his smash single “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” and “Good News.” Though Shaboozey didn’t appear in any sketches, Heidi Gardner did promise to show him her “shapoozey” in her Weekend Update segment as a mother whose son just got famous. Mescal also starred in a pre-taped video that reimagined the trailer for his forthcoming film Gladiator II as a musical. Watch both performances below, plus Shaboozey’s promotional video with host Paul Mescal and cast member Chloe Fineman.
Last month, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” tied the all-time record for most total weeks spent at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, which it now shares with Lil Nas X and Billy Rae Cyrus’ “Old Town Road.” He also shared the song “Good News,” his first new song since the May release of his debut album, Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going. Shaboozey is nominated for five awards at the 2025 Grammys, including in the major categories Best New Artist and Song of the Year.
Saturday Night Live’s 50th season has featured performances from Mk.gee, Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, Stevie Nicks, Coldplay, and Jelly Roll. Ariana Grande hosted an episode, and Charli XCX pulled double duty as both host and musical guest last month. Next week, Chris Rock will be joined by Gracie Abrams, while Martin Short and Hozier are set as guests for the following episode.
