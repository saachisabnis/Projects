It‚Äôs finally Friday, and we‚Äôre about to officially transition into fall this weekend. Today, we‚Äôre visiting Beacon Hill and the Toy Hall of Fame, and revisiting Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre‚Äôs lavish lifestyle.
But first, Globe business columnist Larry Edelman answers my questions about what the Federal Reserve‚Äôs big half-point interest rate cut means for consumers. Larry writes the biweekly newsletter Trendlines; you can subscribe to it here.
Q: I‚Äôve wanted to buy a house for ages. How far do you think mortgage interest rates will drop? Will they go low enough for current homeowners to refinance?
Larry Edelman: Actually, rates on home loans had already dropped in anticipation of the Fed‚Äôs action; the average rate on a 30-year fixed loan was 6.1 percent this week. That‚Äôs down from 6.5 percent a month ago and 7.8 percent last October. Whoot! Mortgage rates don‚Äôt move in lock-step with the Fed, but they should fall even more when the central bank makes additional cuts. But here‚Äôs the thing: No one expects a return of the days when mortgages were under 3 percent. We probably won‚Äôt see rates under 5 percent for a while, if ever.
As for refinancing, it all depends on your loan rate. The rule of thumb is that current rates should be 1 to 2 percentage points below your existing rate so that you save enough on your monthly payments to justify the refinancing costs.

Q: Lots of people have student loans and/or credit card debt. Will this cut affect either of those?

Larry: Most federal student loans carry a fixed rate, so they won‚Äôt change. Some private student loans have a variable rate, but as our colleague Sean P. Murphy points out, private student loans do not offer the same benefits as federal student loans, such as deferment, repayment plans, and forgiveness programs.
As for credit cards, their outrageously high interest rates do change along with the prime rate, which is typically pegged to Fed rates. Will you notice a difference? Probably not, so keep paying your balances off each month if you can.
Q: I‚Äôm also thinking about my savings. It looks like this cut will mean that the interest rates on savings accounts will drop. Where should I put my money now?
Larry: Yes, the downside of the Fed lowering rates is that yields on bank CDs, money market funds, and online savings accounts will fall. If you‚Äôve got any spare cash that you can afford to lock up, put it into an FDIC-insured CD before rates drop more. You could also consider short-term government bills that mature in a year or less.
Q: I read that the Federal Reserve cut rates so much because it‚Äôs worried about the job market. How are those two things connected?
Larry: Employers are hiring less than they were last year because consumers are spending less and there‚Äôs uncertainty about the economy and the election. But lower interest rates will help the economy by making it cheaper for consumers to borrow money and for businesses to get loans for expansion. And when they expand, they hire.
Q: Is there anything else people should know about how this interest rate cut will affect them?

Larry: We‚Äôre in uncharted territory. Usually the Fed cuts rates after there has been some sort of shock to the economy ‚Äî like the pandemic ‚Äî or when a recession has started. Today, the Fed is taking preemptive action. It could be up to a year or more before the full impact of lower rates works through the economy. So it‚Äôs far from clear whether the Fed can forestall a slowdown.
The Globe‚Äôs Sean P. Murphy has more on how the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate cut may affect you in his column, The Fine Print.

There have been two conventions, two assassination attempts, one debate, and rallies galore. So who‚Äôs ahead in the race for president?
According to the averages of reputable national and state polls compiled by The New York Times, Washington Post, and 538 at ABC News, neither candidate has yet to gain a decisive advantage. Democrat Kamala Harris leads GOP nominee Donald Trump by 2 to 3 percentage points nationally as of yesterday.
The national number is one thing, but we all know that what really matters are the Electoral College votes. So when it comes to seven battleground states ‚Äî Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin ‚Äî Harris is either ahead or tied with Trump in most of them.
The Times‚Äô averages show:
The Washington Post‚Äôs averages also have Harris leading by 2 points nationally. As for the battleground states:
Finally, 538 at ABC News has Harris ahead by almost 3 points nationally, and gives Nevada to Harris (for now):
Note: These news organizations don‚Äôt compile all of the same polls and give more weight to different surveys. These are running totals that change whenever a new poll is added to the mix. And all of them have varying margins of error.
Are polls accurate? Here‚Äôs one view from Nate Silver.

I‚Äôve always wanted to do a corn maze omg https://www.vermontcornmaze.com/ 
Where we share our adventures around New England and rate them for Starting Point readers.
This indie movie theater that doubles as a concert venue is a perfect place to watch the latest films as well as classics while supporting a local business. The beautiful art deco architecture transports you back in time, complete with a retro concession stand. And the popcorn is pretty decently priced compared to the large movie chains: A small goes for $5. Rating: Bagged 9/10 (üí∞)
This eatery specializes in Mediterranean and Jamaican food, but my rating is based on my trying only the latter. The food is flavorful, and as someone who enjoys hot dishes, the high spice level actually surprised me. Some of the dishes are made-to-order so you might have to wait a bit for your food ‚Äî but it‚Äôs worth it. Plus, the restaurant is walkable from many historic Salem sites. Rating: Bagged 9/10 (üí∞)
