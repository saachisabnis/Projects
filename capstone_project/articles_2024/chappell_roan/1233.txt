Chappell Roan told her massive crowd at this year’s New York Governor’s Ball that she turned down an invitation from the White House to perform in honor of Pride Month, citing the war in Gaza.
Roan, in full green Statue of Liberty body paint, started her set on Sunday by addressing the audience:
In response to the White House, who asked me to perform for Pride — We want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.
Variety had more of her comments:
Referencing her costume, she continued later, “I am in drag of the biggest queen of all,” she said to cheers and laughs. “But in case you had forgotten what’s etched on my pretty little toes, ‘Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning to breath free,'” she said, quoting the poem written on the 1903 bronze plaque in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. “That means freedom and trans rights, that means freedom and women’s rights, and it especially means freedom for all people in oppressed” — she paused, apparently tearing up — “for all oppressed people in occupied territories.”
However, the seriousness of her statement was slightly undercut by her abrupt change in tone when saying “Thank you! OK, we’re gonna do ‘Hot to Go!'”

The White House confirmed to Variety that an invitation was extended and then turned down.
President Joe Biden and his administration have received continued pushback related to their support of Israel in their war against Hamas, which has left Gaza in a humanitarian crisis with tens of thousands dead. Biden has called for an immediate ceasefire.
