Just like most of us, many events take a brief pause this week as we enjoy our holiday break. 
Rest assured, there's still lots to do. Made in Tucson brings 300 artists to the Fourth Avenue area, the Black Owned Business Festival welcomes artists, food trucks and music, the City of Tucson's art fair features two days of shopping. Christmas festivities also debut this week, from a buffet that includes Buddy the Elf's iconic spaghetti to the 1 million twinkling lights at the Tucson Botanical Gardens.
Of course, things can change quickly these days. Check for the latest info before you head out!
