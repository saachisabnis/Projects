Drawing in a crowd of more than 100,000 festival-goers is an impressive feat for any artists, especially if that artist isn't even one of the headliners. That's reportedly what happened last week when rising pop phenom Chappell Roan hit the stage for Lollapalooza 2024 in Chicago, and now a spokesperson is claiming that the crowd she drew in may just be the biggest ever for the long-running festival.
The 26-year-old "Femininomenon" singer turned the Lolla grounds into her very own "Pink Pony Club" for her daytime set on Thursday (August 1) for the first day of the iconic festival, and the crowd was so big that it may have set a new record for the biggest Lollapalooza has ever seen, per CNN.
"Chappell's performance was the biggest daytime set we've ever seen," a festival spokesperson said. "It was a magical moment added to Lolla's DNA."
The festival shared a photo on X (formerly Twitter) of the packed crowd alongside the downtown Chicago skyline, writing, "It's Chappell's world and we're just living in it."
Though final numbers for the turnout haven't been shared, a spokesperson revealed that festival drew in 110,000 attendees each day this year. Sources close to the festival and to the "Good Luck, Babe!" musician said the crowd that packed in to see Roan is believed to be Lolla's biggest set of all time, including those seen at the festival's international extensions in countries like Brazil, France, Germany and Sweden.
