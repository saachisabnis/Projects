Chappell Roan put on a dazzling performance as she kicked off the sold-out UK leg of her tour in Manchester on Friday night - just days after she lashed out at a photographer at the VMAs.
The singer, 26, looked incredible in a mermaid-themed bejewelled bodysuit as she stepped out to perform at her first British concert since she rocketed to stardom.
Her gorgeous enemble, which she rocked for most of the show, featured an array of under-the-sea themed details, including pearls, a starfish, and shells.
The singer and songwriter, who performs in drag, completed her main on-stage look with pink cowboy boots and glittering green eyeshadow.
She treated the crowd to her biggest hits, including Good Luck Babe, Hot To Go, and Red Wine Supernova.

The next stops in her highly-anticipated tour are Glasgow and Dublin, before she's set to perform three sold-out shows at London's O2 Academy Brixton on 19, 20 and 21 September.
Her Manchester performance comes just after she was filmed furiously hitting back at a photographer as she walked the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday.
The singer was praised by fans for 'defending herself' as she delivered an expletive-laden response while posing for snaps ahead of the ceremony.
In footage of the incident, a photographer was heard shouting: 'Shut the f*** up,' Chappell turned and bellowed back: 'YOU shut the f*** up!'
She added: 'No! Not me, b****!' prompting whoops from some of the observers on the scene. 'Tell him, girl,' said one woman who was watching the encounter.
The exchange began when a male photographer off-camera was heard apparently shouting that someone needed to 'turn.'
Chappell at that point was facing away from the cameras, as she was in the process of having her extravagant red carpet outfit adjusted.
The star has previously been vocal about her exasperation over 'weird' fans making her 'uncomfortable' with their intrusive behavior - prompting a backlash from social media users who felt she was being ungrateful for her stardom.

However, fans have taken to social media to praise Chappell's response, with posts on X including: 'They hate when women are outspoke and confident and not scared to speak up and defend themselves;
'Love to see a woman defend herself; Ate him, up as she should;
'Love to see a woman stand up to disrespect; Finally a celebrity standing up for herself.'
Ahead of the ceremony, Chappell put a saucy spin in a medieval warrior princess costume, complete with a plunging chiffon frock, a large cross, spiked fingernails, gauntlets and a sword.
The Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl singer, who has come out as a lesbian, was accompanied by a towering mystery man dressed as a medieval guard.
She went onto win the VMA for Best New Artist, and gushed in her speech: 'Can you believe it? We're at the VMAs! I'm gonna read from - I wrote a speech - from my diary.'

'Thank you, MTV and Island Records and my team and my family and friends. I dedicate this to all the drag artists who inspire me, who inspire me, and I dedicate this to queer and trans people that fuel pop, to the gays who dedicate my songs to someone they love or hate,' she said.
Her red carpet outburst comes after she voiced her 'frustration' that people are only now beginning to take her seriously as an artist.
The Pink Pony Club singer made the comments in a cover story for Rolling Stone.
'What's so infuriating is how people are just now taking me seriously,' she expressed. 'Like, 'You know what, b***h? I've been doing this s*** and you're just now catching up.''
'Part of me hopes I never have a hit again because then no one will ever expect anything from me again,' the star told Rolling Stone.
But Chappell explained that music is her passion. 'It's my dream job. I never know if it's going to be like this ever again, which is kind of scary.'
