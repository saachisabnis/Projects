Bring Me The Horizon will headline Reading & Leeds Festival 2025.
On the news, Oli Sykes says “We are beyond excited to be returning to Reading & Leeds for our first fully fledged headline slot. We are going to bring hands down the greatest show of our careers. It’s going to be our only UK performance next year and the final European show of the NEX GEN campaign before the band take time away, so if you want to see BMTH next year, this truly is your only chance. Can’t wait.” 
Enter Shikari, Soft Play and Amyl And The Sniffers are among the other rock names on the lineup. 
The event, which will also be headlined by Travis Scott, Hozier and Chappell Roan, takes place August 21-24.
