"Pro wrestling doesn't get Eddie Vedder than this"
Fans of pro-wrestling and Pearl Jam have found themselves united by the entrance music of Steven Flowe.
Last Sunday (December 8) at Chicago’s Concord Music Hall, the grunge inspired wrestler featured in The SuperWrestlers: Unleashed event and channelled a ’90s Eddie Vedder right down to the long hair, as well as donning two plaid shirts and clutching a guitar.
Ahead of facing competitor Jordan Kross, he walked to the ring to a parody of Pearl Jam’s ‘Even Flow’ with his name repeated for the entirety of the track, much to the delight of fans.
Since footage of the moment emerged on social media, viewers have been praising the gimmick, as well as coming up with their own puns. “Pro wrestling doesn’t get Eddie Vedder than this,” joked one fan on Reddit, while others on X/Twitter were speculating what his finisher could be named.

In the match I saw online he took one of them off and threw it in to the crowd then delivered an elbow drop (like The Rock with his elbow pad).
I don't think the commentators mentioned the name but I'm hoping it's called The Stevens El-Flowe

Wearing a flannel shirt and then also having a second flannel shirt tied around your waist is such a cool move

Wrestling has a long-standing crossover with the music world, which this year alone has seen Chappell Roan debut a Lucha libre inspired outfit at her Lollapalooza 2024 set and WWE Hall Of Famer Shawn Michaels invite Kendrick Lamar and Drake to “settle” their feud in the ring.
Likewise, TNA wrestler Joe Hendry spoke to NME earlier this year about his theme song ‘I Believe In Joe Hendry’ entering the UK Singles download and sales charts.
In April, the Scottish athlete started a social campaign to get his upbeat theme song to the top spot on the UK Official Singles chart with the hope of “giving Taylor Swift a break from being Number One.”
His grassroots campaign saw his song go viral online with wrestling fans creating memes, leading to ‘I Believe In Joe Hendry’ to top the iTunes charts – beating competition Swift, Hozier, Sabrina Carpenter, Beyoncé and more.
The song also debuted at Number Four on the UK Singles Download chart – the highest accomplishment for any wrestling song ever.
Elsewhere, Pearl Jam – who WWE star Becky Lynch told MetalHammer were one of her favourite grunge bands – have announced their 2025 US tour dates in support of new album ‘Dark Matter’.
