Chappell Roan has cancelled two upcoming gigs amid a series of struggles

The 26-year-old singer has endured a meteoric rise to fame over the course of the last year and explained on Friday (27.09.24) that she has had to pull out of a couple of festival appearances because she has been "overwhelmed" by everything in recent times. 

She wrote on Instagram: "I apologise to people who have been waiting to see me in NYC and DC this weekend at All Things Go, but I am unable to perform. "Things have gotten overwhelming over the past few weeks and I am really feeling it.

"I feel pressures to prioritise a lot of things right now and I need a few days to prioritise my health. I want to be present when I perform and give the best shows possible. Thank you for understanding. Be back soon xox."

The 'Good Luck, Babe!' hitmaker  - whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz - did not elaborate on her situation any further, but has been open in the past about her struggles with suddenly becoming known around the world. 

She wrote on Instagram: "I want to love my life, be outside, giggle with my friends, go to the movie theater, feel safe, and do all the things every single person deserves to do. Please stop touching me. Please stop being weird to my family and friends. Please stop assuming things about me. There is always more to the story. l am scared and tired. And please—don't call me Kayleigh. I feel more love than I ever have in my life. I feel the most unsafe I have ever felt in my life.

"There is a part of myself that I save just for my project and all of you. There is a part of myself that is just for me, and I don’t want that taken away from me. "
