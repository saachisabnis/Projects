“Dance Moms” star JoJo Siwa was ruthlessly trolled for claiming she invented “gay pop” simply because she sings and she’s gay.
The reality television star gave herself far too much credit when she tooted her own horn during her April 6 interview with Billboard. “When I first signed with Columbia, I said I wanted to start a new genre of music,” she said during her interview. “They said, ‘What do you mean?’ and I said, ‘It’s called ‘gay pop.’ It’s like K-pop but it’s gay pop.'” In the same breath, she went on to rhyme off the names of several other artists before her who also recorded the same music. The bold claims were immediately noticed by fans, and they quickly took aim at her bizarre comments.

Siwa quickly found herself standing corrected by people from across the globe who reminded her she didn’t ‘start’ any sort of new genre of music whatsoever.
The former Disney star was attempting to revamp her image by shifting to a more adult style of marketing, with a steamy new music video for her song, “Karma.”
Instead, she missed the mark and is being slammed by people who can’t believe she had the audacity to lay false claims about initiating a new wave of music.

“‘I’m creating a new genre of pop’ and then proceeds to list the artists already making that kind of music,” wrote one social media user.
“I strive to be this delusional,” wrote another person.
“The ego on this girl WOO,” an internet user said.

Another person called her right out by saying, “Can someone explain to her that Kim Petras, Hayley Kiyoko, Tegan and Sara, Chappell Roan, Lil Nas X, Troye Sivan, Halsey, Demi Lavato, King Princess, Sam Smith, Miley, Lady Gaga and so many others have been out here doing ‘gay pop’ for a while, and it’s not ‘her new genre of music.'”
Someone wrote, “I have so much second hand embarrassment😬🫨😶,” which pretty much sums up how everyone feels about Siwa right now. (RELATED: JoJo Siwa’s Outfit Makes Me Think Signs Of Nickelodeon Damage Showed Up At A Young Age)
She seems to have canceled herself right before the release of her new album — this probably isn’t going according to plan.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
