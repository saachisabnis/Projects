The girlies already know that this is the summer of Chappell Roan. The singer exploded online this year after opening for artist Olivia Rodrigo, and she's been suddenly outshining the headliners on festivals like Bonnaroo, Coachella, Boston Calling and more.
One of her most iconic songs right now is the story of a girl who just won't listen to her mother, and instead insists on dancing at the "Pink Pony Club".
The song is catchy, and it has left people all over the internet trying to find the infamous Pink Pony Club referenced in the song. There are a few Michiganders that think maybe Chappell could be singing about Mackinac Island
There is a Pink Pony located on Mackinac Island, but it's less of a club and more of a restaurant.
A few people have already visited this summer and. made TikTok videos joking that they found the "Pink Pony Club" on Mackinac Island, but unfortunately, it's very unlikely that Chappell Roan is a secret Michigander.

While it's fun to think that the "Hot To Go" singer could be referencing the mitten state, the lyrics in the song indicate early on that she's likely referencing that the "Pink Pony Club" is located in California, specifically Los Angeles.
I know you wanted me to stayBut I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LAAnd I heard that there's a special placeWhere boys and girls can all be queens every single dayI'm having wicked dreams of leaving TennesseeHear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling meWon't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a sceneShe sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream
And, Chappell has come forward saying that the entire song was inspired by a night she spent at the Abbey, a gay club in Los Angeles.
So no, the Pink Pony Club isn't located on Mackinac Island, but that doesn't mean you can't bring your pink cowboy hat and live your best Pink Pony Girl life when you visit.
