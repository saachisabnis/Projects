After three long months, Taylor Swift has been vanquished.
Eminem came along with “The Death of Slim Shady” and knocked “Tortured Poets to number 4.
The new Marshall Mathers album sold 287,000 copies, with 100,000 of those streaming equivalent.
“Poets” really had the stuffing knocked out of it, selling just 83,000 copies — the first time it went under 100,000. After selling almost 5 million copies, I guess everyone who wanted it has “Poets” in all forms.
New to the charts: Clairo’s “Charm” album with 44,000 copies. Three years ago, Claire Cottrill’s father, a marketing exec, steered her first album to no sales and instant failure. So it’s nice to see she’s overcome that swing and miss — at least for now.
Singer of the summer: hands down, Chappell Roan. She’s everywhere, and she’s good! A genuine artist. Her “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” has sold around 600,000 copies. Her publicists don’t return emails, but that’s what happens when you become an overnight star!
Showbiz411 is now in its 13th year of providing breaking and exclusive entertainment news. This is an independent site, unlike the many Hollywood trades that are owned by one company. To continue providing news that takes a fresh look at what's going on in movies, music, theater, etc, advertising is our basis. Reader donations would be greatly appreciated, too. They are just another facet of keeping fact based journalism alive.Thank you
