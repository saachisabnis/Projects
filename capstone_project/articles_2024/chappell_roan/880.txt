	On the final night of Olivia Rodrigo‘s Madison Square Garden takeover for the Guts world tour, she welcomed Jewel onstage for a dazzling duet of the singer-songwriter’s 1995 hit “You Were Meant for Me.”

	“She is such an incredible songwriter. When I first started writing my songs, I would listen to her album Pieces of You before I went to bed,” Rodrigo said, before welcoming Jewel onstage. “She’s incredible and it’s such an honor that she’s here with me tonight.”

	Jewel took the stage dressed in a black top, flowy pants, and a hat. The two women strummed their guitars and took turns singing the song’s lyrics before joining together in harmony for the chorus. “Dreams last so long/Even after you’re gone/I know that you love me,” the pair sang. “And soon you will see/You were meant for me.”

	“You Were Meant for Me” was featured on Jewel’s debut album, Pieces of You, in 1995 and reached Number Two on the Billboard Hot 100.

	Rodrigo has featured several guests at several of her concerts on her recent tour. During her first show in New York City on Friday, April 5, she welcomed Noah Kahan onstage to perform a duet of “Stick Season.” Rodrigo, a longtime fan of Kahan, previously covered the track for BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge.

	Rodrigo also brought out Sheryl Crow onstage during her concert in Nashville to perform “If It Makes You Happy.” Tuesday’s show is her final set of the American leg on her tour before Europe. (Remi Wolf will open for her there.) She’ll be back in the United States later this summer.

	Rodrigo kicked off her run of shows in Palm Springs in February with Chappell Roan opening for her on the road. She’s made her way across the country with stops in Chicago, Nashville, St. Louis, and Miami.

	“Rodrigo cemented her position in pop culture as a generation-defining artist. As a rockstar. And as an energy-filled idol that is only just beginning her career,” Rolling Stone wrote in a review of the tour.
