	If you think Chappell Roan will let you cross her boundaries, good luck babe.

	The “Red Wine Supernova” singer took to TikTok on Monday (Aug. 19) to open up about “harassment” she’s been receiving from fans recently. “Just answer my questions for a second,” she says in the two-part clip. “If you saw a random woman on the street, would you yell at her from the car window? Would you harass her in public? Would you go up to a random lady and say, ‘Can I get a photo you with you?’ And she’s like, ‘No, what the f—?’ And then you get mad at this random lady? Would you be offended if she says no to your time because she has her own time? Would you stalk her family? Would you follow her around? Would you try to dissect her life and bully her online? This is a lady you don’t know, and she doesn’t know you at all.”

	Calling herself a “random b—-,” Roan continued, “I don’t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous. […] I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, the career field I’ve chosen. That doesn’t make it OK. That doesn’t make it normal. That doesn’t mean I want it, doesn’t mean I like it. I don’t want whatever the f— you think you’re supposed to be entitled to whenever you see a celebrity.”

	She concluded that she doesn’t “give a fuck” if it’s “selfish” to decline photos or hugs. “That’s not normal. That’s weird. That’s f—ing weird.”

	Roan has skyrocketed to fame in the months since she dropped her debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess last year. After a series of headline-making performances — including at Coachella and Gov Ball 2024 — the 14-track project earned a new peak of No. 5 on the Billboard 200 last month.

	The singer previously shared her thoughts on the ups and downs of fame with Drew Afualo on the latter’s The Comment Section podcast last month. “People have started to be freaks — like, [they] follow me and know where my parents live, and where my sister works. All this weird s–t,” she explained.

	She continued, “I’m just kind of in this battle … I’ve pumped the brakes on, honestly, anything to make me more known. It’s kind of a forest fire right now. I’m not trying to go do a bunch of s–t.”

	However, Roan also shared the positives of her newfound fame, including recognition from her idols. “People who I’ve looked up to my entire life are like peers, which is sick,” she told Afualo, noting, “Miley [Cyrus] invited me to a party, and I was like, ‘You don’t know that you were my first concert when the Jonas Brothers were opening for you.’”
