If you’re hoping to see Adele perform live any time soon, then it looks like you’re out of luck.
The singer has announced that she is taking an extended break once she has completed the remaining gigs in her Las Vegas residency in November.
At the weekend, the Brit ended her run of gigs in Munich, and told fans that, after her Vegas shows, “I will not see you for an incredibly long time.”

At the tenth show of her residency at the Messe München arena in Germany, she said: “I have really enjoyed performing for nearly three years now, which is the longest I’ve ever done and probably the longest I’ll ever do.
“And I have ten shows left after this, back in my residency… but after that, I will not see you for an incredibly long time.” 
She told the crowd: “I will hold you dear in my heart for that whole length of my break, and I will fantasise about these shows and any shows that I’ve done over the last three years. And I will really, really hold them in the bottom of my heart forever. It has been amazing, I just need a rest”
Becoming visibly emotional, she added: “I have spent the last seven years building a new life for myself, and I want to live it now.
“I will miss you terribly.”
The news follows Adele saying in July that she has no plans to release new music in the near future. 
Fans took to social media to respond to the latest news, with one writing: “Take all the time you need, live the life you’ve always been dreaming of. We’ll be here when you’re ready @adele”
Someone else wrote: “I'm gonna miss her 😭”
Another, having seen the video of her announcement on X, added: “Why am I so emotional watching this 🥺”
Earlier in her Munich residency, Adele gave some advice to Chappell Roan and revealed she is “very excited for her”. Read about it here.
