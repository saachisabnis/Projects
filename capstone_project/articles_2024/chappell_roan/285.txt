Leading up to Boston Calling 2024, which took over the Harvard Athletic Complex Memorial Day weekend, I was nagged by a persistent question: Who, exactly, is Boston Calling for in 2024?
The answer has undoubtedly evolved since the festival first dazzled audiences on a cold, rainy weekend at City Hall Plaza 11 years ago. That first edition, headlined by festival curator Aaron Dessner’s band The National, featured almost 100 percent bands that fell somewhere on the indie rock spectrum — a reflection of festival co-founders Brian Appel and Mike Snow’s origins at independent radio station WFNX and defunct alt-weekly the Boston Phoenix .
But times and tastes change, and Boston Calling has changed along with them. What was once indie becomes mainstream, what was mainstream becomes retro, and what didn’t exist until six months ago is the hottest thing on the planet. 
Dessner, a force in the indie rock world, has worked extensively as a producer for Taylor Swift, the most popular pop star of this generation — and quite possibly any generation, if she keeps breaking records. And since moving to Harvard Athletic Complex in 2017, Boston Calling has grown in capacity and ambition, landing stadium-level talents like Metallica in 2022 and Swift collaborator Ed Sheeran this year.
Change can be a good thing. Stars revered by Gen Z and Gen Alpha like Reneé Rapp and Chappell Roan were some of the highlights of Boston Calling 2024, and Megan Thee Stallion delivered arguably the most high-powered rap set at the festival since Travis Scott in 2019.
That’s not to say the festival has abandoned its roots, either. Young The Giant, who played the very first Boston Calling, were back again this year. So too was Frank Turner, who played the May 2014 festival, and the Killers, who didn’t play Boston Calling until 2018, but would have easily fit in the rock-heavy early lineups.
The answer, then, to the question of who Boston Calling is for? It’s for everyone.
It has always been for high schoolers and college kids who go with 10 of their best friends to see their favorite artists. It’s also for twenty- and thirty-somethings who now make enough money to pay festival prices to see their favorite bands from high school or college for a weekend. 
Most of all, it’s for music lovers of any age  who possess an open mind and an adventurous spirit. I had only a vague awareness of Chappell Roan’s music heading into the weekend, but by the end of her set on Sunday, I was a convert. Similarly, one of my college-aged coworkers was unfamiliar with Trey Anastasio, but came away impressed by the Phish guitarist and his Classic Tab band’s jam-heavy Saturday night performance. 
In honor of my colleague Chad Finn, whose unconventional reviews are a must-read after every Patriots game, here’s my unconventional review of Boston Calling 2024.
For the first few hours on Friday, you could easily move around the festival grounds. Then came time for Reneé Rapp’s 5:55 set, and suddenly the crowd swelled, with young fans filling the Green Stage area to support the “Mean Girls” star.
Beyond typical festival fashion, the most common accessory was Ed Sheeran merchandise. The English singer-songwriter has consistently filled Gillette Stadium, and the T-shirts from previous editions of the Math tours made it look like a physics conference.
Rapp made her apologies for the song “I Hate Boston” early and often. The Broadway singer turned pop star first clarified that the track was about a “trying time” she had in the city with some exes. When she got to the lyrics “As far as I’m concerned, they should just burn the whole city down,” she quickly added, “That’s not true anymore!” Not that her fans needed convincing, 
The Wolff Sisters weren’t part of Saturday’s country-influenced lineup, but the Americana/roots rock trio from Hyde Park would have fit right in. Check out their latest single “Hurricane,” or their most popular song “Down by the Lake” for a taste.
For the second year in a row, Dunkin’s two-story lounge was the hit of the festival. Two separate lines – one for the ground floor, one for the balcony — were each longer than the queues for every other concession, as fans waited for free coffee, gift cards, temporary tattoos, and other Dunkin’ goodness.

Leading up to the festival’s first-ever country headliner, Tyler Childers, Saturday’s lineup had country or country-adjacent acts on every stage. 
Walking to the Blue Stage for a 5:50 set from The Red Clay Strays, there was a noticeable change in the crowd’s aesthetic from Friday. Fans in Luke Bryan T-shirts and American flag cowboy hats lined up for the ferris wheel. A couple in matching Bass Pro Shop tank tops edged toward the front of the stage. Two guys in Alabama Crimson Tide shirts spit chewing tobacco into (hopefully) empty Miller Lite cans. For a day, Boston Calling had gone country.
Not that Red Clay Strays frontman Brandon Coleman saw it that way: He considers the Mobile, Ala. group to be rock ‘n roll. (Perhaps he’s onto something, as the group will be opening for the Rolling Stones at Gillette Stadium later this week.)
The other distinct demo at Saturday’s shows were jam band fans, who gathered en masse for a set from Phish lead guitarist Trey Anastasio on the Red Stage. Grateful Dead tees, gray dreads, and barefoot dance circles made for a festive atmosphere.

 On the Green Stage, Khruangbin played a mesmerizing, largely instrumental set of groovy tunes, with one track melding into another. The repeated chorus of “Time (You and I)” — “That’s life / If we had more time, we could live forever” — felt like a zen koan mantra, putting the the swaying crowd under the trio’s spell.
My favorite local discovery of the weekend was Paper Lady, a five-piece indie band formed in 2019 by a group of Berklee students. Singer Alli Raina showcased haunting, otherworldly vocals with a cover of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit” and on “Violet,” the powerful closing track on the band’s 2023 EP “Traveling Exploding Star.”
In terms of paying respect to the festival’s Harvard confines, Red Bull deserves some kudos for reviving Out of Town News to hand out free energy drinks to the music-loving masses.

I’ve been to every single Boston Calling, and I’ve never seen the festival more crowded than it was on Sunday, which was the only day that sold out. The number I heard from a few different festival sources was 40,000 people (compared to only 16,000 on Saturday), but it felt like even more than that.
Part of the reason the grounds felt so oppressively crowded was that almost all of those 40,000 people were already in place to see Chappell Roan on the Green Stage at 4:05 p.m. The festival has a history of putting up-and-coming acts in a midday slot, which is a cool way to let fans say they saw a future headliner “before they got big.” Noah Kahan, who is set to perform multiple sold-out dates at Fenway Park this summer, played at around the same time last year, for example.

But the consequence of Sunday’s schedule was almost no one left the area surrounding the Green and Red Stages for seven consecutive hours. There was a brief surge for concessions after Roan finished her set, but by the time Megan Thee Stallion walked onto the Green Stage at 6:25, many people were essentially stuck in place. 
Logistics that worked seamlessly on Friday and Saturday were suddenly overrun. Staff began handing out $5 waters freely to the crowds, but the number of overheated concertgoers who needed medical assistance – which is something that happens at every outdoor music festival, to be clear – spiked.
Meanwhile, I swung by the Blue Stage on the opposite end of the grounds a few times, and despite great bands like Blondshell and Alvvays playing, there was never more than a few hundred people there.
The performances throughout Sunday were some of the best all weekend, but as comments on Boston Calling’s social media accounts (and on our Instagram as well) showed, the crowds were a problem.

On Tuesday, Boston Calling organizers issued a statement promising to continue working to “create a better environment for everyone.”
“We deeply appreciate the audience, staff, and performers who make Boston Calling possible, and want to acknowledge feedback from Sunday,” organizers posted on Instagram. “While attendee count was several thousand below the official capacity rating of the site, we never want anyone to feel uncomfortable or unsafe at the show.
“The safety and well-being of our fans, artists, guests and staff is paramount,” the statement continued. “We will to continue to work with public officials and our operations team to improve the experience, layout, and ultimately create a better environment for everyone.”

 In honor of all the free water they handed out on a day when it was sorely needed, it’s got to be Liquid Death, which had a macabre country club full of skulls, grim reapers, and a casket full of new flavored waters.
After being unable to negotiate the crowd to see the start of Hozier, I encountered the heaviest music of the weekend from Fleshwater, a hardcore band part of the broader nu-gaze movement.
You could argue the real answer is Chappell Roan (and you can read my colleague Heather Alterisio’s recap of her performance), but letting my extreme millennial bias show, I have to pick The Killers.
Brandon Flowers and co. are old pros at this point, having played the exact same stage in 2018 and currently touring on the back of a greatest hits album. Songs like “All These Things That I’ve Done,” “Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,” and “Somebody Told Me” had the crowd singing along to every word. 
Ever the showman, Flowers waited until the very end to deliver the band’s biggest hits, finishing with “When You Were Young,” then coming back for an encore of “Human” and “Mr. Brightside.”
