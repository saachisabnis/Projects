The 'Ride' singer showed up to her headlining set in style – perched on the back of a motorcycle
Lana Del Rey‘s epic blockbuster entrance from Coachella 2024 has been making its rounds all over social media.
The ‘Summertime Sadness’ singer arrived in style at Coachella’s main stage on Friday (April 12) for her headlining set. Del Rey and her backup dancers showed up standing on the back of a black motorcycle, sporting a sparkly light blue dress.
Her unreleased track ‘Jealous Too’ served as the score for the epic moment as the trail of motorcycles made their way through the barricaded path to the stage. At the end of her set, she exited the same way she came in, perched on the back of a motorcycle, this time wearing a dress adorned with crystals.

In a four-star review of the ‘Ride’ singer’s headlining set, NME wrote: “As well as an impressive catalogue, what Del Rey has also created over the last 12 years is impact – something that’s evident across Coachella this year. Earlier in the day, Chappell Roan projects her image onto the screen behind her as she performs, while throughout the bill, you can spot more artists who’ve been inspired by the headliner, like Suki Waterhouse and The Last Dinner Party.”
It continued: “After ‘Video Games’ ends, Del Rey turns to the crowd to remind them Eilish is “the voice of our generation”, but her guest has her own truth to share: “This is the reason for half of you bitches’ existence,” Eilish bluntly declares. A short while later, Del Rey returns backstage on her motorcade. As she waves to the crowd like a 1920s beauty queen on an elegant victory lap, it’s clear redemption is not the theme of the night but a celebration of a star who always stays true to herself.”

Elsewhere, Del Rey brought out Billie Eilish as a special guest to perform a duet of ‘Video Games’ and ‘Ocean Eyes’.
Prior to Eilish’s surprise appearance, Lana Del Rey brought out Jon Batiste to perform ‘Candy Necklace’, and invited Jack Antonoff onstage to play piano for ‘Hope Is A Dangerous Thing For A Woman Like Me To Have – But I Have It’.
