If you were hoping to get tickets to see this artist in Franklin, but weren’t able to because they were sold out too quickly- you have a 2nd chance.
Chappell Roan is everywhere right now and is playing First Bank Amphitheater on October 1st, but tickets were sold out within minutes of going on sale.. BUT as of yesterday, there are more tickets available because they worked with Ticketmaster to cancel scalper and bot tickets, meaning those will be available again for fans.
You have to request a spot and then they’ll choose people from that list to purchase them! More details HERE
Good Luck, Babe!
