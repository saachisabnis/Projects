The former NME cover star also dressed as the Statue Of Liberty for the occasion
Chappell Roan showcased a new song at the Governors Ball 2024 yesterday (June 9).
The former NME cover star, who was dressed as a New York taxi during the performance, debuted the new track ‘Subway’ at Flushing Meadows Corona Park.
Later in the show, Roan who also dressed as the Statue Of Liberty at one point, introduced ‘My Kink Is Karma’ by revealing she turned down an invitation to perform at the White House for a Pride event. You can view both performances below.
She said: “This is a response to the White House, who asked me to preform for Pride. We want liberty, justice, and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.”

During the weekend at the Governors Ball, The Killers also covered Yeah Yeah Yeahs‘ classic track ‘Maps’ during their headlining set while Sabrina Carpenter also gave her latest song ‘Please Please Please‘ its live debut.
Meanwhile, Roan recently announced a a handful of live dates within the UK and Europe later this year.
Her string of gigs will kick off at the Le Bataclan in Paris on September 3. From there, Roan will make stops in Amsterdam, London, Manchester, and Glasgow before wrapping up at the Dublin Academy in Ireland on September 17.
The run of dates mark Roan’s largest international headlining shows to date, including a landmark night at London’s Eventim Apollo – visit here for tickets.
The shows are in support of her debut LP ‘The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess‘. In a four-star review of the LP, NME shared: “These sharp pop moments shine brighter than some of the weaker ballads that pad out the lengthy tracklist. Yet ‘The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess’ is a display of Roan’s bold and brazen pen, where she places searing revelations alongside some deliciously cheeky choruses.”
Elsewhere, Roan’s track ‘Red Wine Supernova’ landed the 47th spot on NME‘s 50 best songs of the year list in 2023. It was described as: “Three minutes of unadulterated joy, it came with killer hooks and lyrics ready-made for mass singalongs. Proof: did any pop song this year arrive with a better couplet than: ‘I heard you like magic / I got a wand and a rabbit’?”
The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.
