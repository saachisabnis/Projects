"It’s not: ‘Let’s do everything, let’s maximise every ounce of the success that’s currently happening’, that’s not the point"
Chappell Roan is reportedly working on new material.
Her manager Nick Bobetsky recently told Music Business Worldwide that the ‘Red Wine Supernova’ singer was currently “busy writing”.
In the interview, Bobesky touched on the slow-burn success of her debut, ‘The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess’, saying the making of that album was “about continuing to do what we’ve always done, and that’s to have a very clear focus on the world of Chappell Roan.”
The record became Roan’s first UK Number One album almost a year after its release. Her rapid ascent comes in part due to the huge global success of her one-off single ‘Good Luck, Babe!’, as well as the support slot she locked in on Olivia Rodrigo’s huge run of ‘Guts’ tour dates.
Looking towards future projects, he added: “I do think that we’re likely going to embrace a very similar plan that we did for this album, which is that when she finishes a song she loves, we put our heads together and quickly work to get that music out. That’s what we did with ‘Good Luck Babe’.”
The former NME cover star recently announced the cancellation of a handful of her European gigs, sighting “scheduling conflicts”, although her manager noted they were not “stretching things too thin” and not doing “a load” of collaborations.
Due to scheduling conflicts, I have had to make the extremely hard decision to cancel my Paris and Amsterdam shows. I have rescheduled my Berlin show to 23 September. I am so sorry & very disappointed 🙁 I promise I will be back. I’m heartbroken 💔 thank you for understanding. pic.twitter.com/nlEL2YhB2X

“And it’s part of our core strategy. It’s not: ‘Let’s do everything, let’s maximise every ounce of the success that’s currently happening’, that’s not the point,” he continued: “The word ‘marketing’ in the world of Chappell Roan means something really different than it does to a lot of artists right now.
“She’s not an artist who’s been driven by, ‘How loud can this moment be? How do I reach more people?’ That doesn’t come into it for her. People feel that, which means they feel part of the success, not separate from it – or from her.”
His comments come after Roan spoke out against “weird” and “creepy” behaviour from fans, telling them: “That’s not normal.” Her remarks earned her praise from Paramore‘s Hayley Williams, who took to Instagram to say the pop star was “brave”.
“this happens to every woman I know from this business, myself included,” wrote Williams. “social media has made this worse. I’m really thankful chappell is willing to address it in a real way, in real time. it’s brave and unfortunately necessary.”
