Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department claims the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart for the 15th total week. Swift’s TTPD ties Carole King’s Tapestry for the third-most weeks spent at No. 1 among albums by women, with King’s masterpiece spending 15 weeks at No. 1 back in 1971. Only Adele’s 21 (24 weeks in 2011-12) and Whitney Houston’s soundtrack to The Bodyguard (20 weeks in 1992-93) have spent more weeks as the No. 1 album among women. Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess made another big jump this week, climbing up to No. 2 on the Billboard 200, while hitting a new chart peak for the third consecutive week. 
No debut albums cracked the Top 10 for the second time in the past three weeks, while the rest of the Billboard 200 Top 5 includes Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moving up a spot to No. 3, Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft climbing up one slot to No. 4, and Zach Bryan’s The Great American Bar Scene jumping up two spots to No. 5.
