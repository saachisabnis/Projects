After performing at her first Coachella earlier this year and riding the high from her first Billboard Hot 100 entry for her single “Good Luck, Babe,” Chappell Roan graced the Green Stage at Boston Calling on Sunday, May 26. 
The singer brought her signature 1980s synth-pop, early 2000s pop sound and drag-inspired makeup to a crowd of thousands during day three of the 3-day music festival.
Roan’s setlist included hits like “Femininomenon,” “Red Wine Supernova,” and “HOT TO GO,” which she compliments with her signature arm dance during live performances.

Working with Olivia Rodrigo’s frequent collaborator Dan Nigro, Roan’s debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” was released in 2023. 
The album was included in several best-albums-of-2023 year-end lists. Roan’s popularity also surged from opening up for Rodrigo’s “Guts World Tour.” 
Roan performed Sunday along with other major acts including Royel Otis, The Revivalists, Megan Thee Stallion, Hozier and The Killers.
