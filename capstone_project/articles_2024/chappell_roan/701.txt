Singer Chappell Roan has recently came out and said she's been diagnosed with severe depression over her rapid rise to fame. Despite not feeling traditionally "sad," she experiences symptoms such as brain fog, poor focus, and a lack of enthusiasm. Roan believes her depression came on due to the challenges of navigating her newfound fame, explaining how simple activities like going to the park, thrifting or going to a yoga class, now require her to have security and plan ahead due to the public attention she now attracts. She has spoken openly about struggling with the pressures of stardom, expressing frustration with the bad behavior of some fans and her discomfort with the celebrity lifestyle.
You would think she would be so happy- but the truth is we are all struggling with something.  The grass definitely isn't always greener on the other side
