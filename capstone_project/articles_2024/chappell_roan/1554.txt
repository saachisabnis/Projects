Chappell Roan is having a challenging time adjusting to her newfound fame as she has quickly rocketed to pop superstardom. Earlier this summer, she performed for the largest crowd in the history of Lollapalooza, and currently has the No. 2 album on the Billboard chart. Amidst all of the chaos that comes with that unaccustomed level of intense popularity, Roan wrote a lengthy post on Instagram to set some boundaries with her surging fanbase. 
“I’ve been in too many nonconsensual physical and social interactions and I just need to lay it out and remind you, women don’t owe you s**t. I chose this career path because I love music and art and honoring my inner child, I do not accept harassment of any kind because I chose this path, nor do I deserve it. I am specifically talking about predatory behavior (disguised as ‘superfan’ behavior) that has become normalized because of the way women who are well-known have been treated in the past. Please do not assume you know a lot about someone’s life, personality, and boundaries because you are familiar with them or their work online.” (Billboard)
