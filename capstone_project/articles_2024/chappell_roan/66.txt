The NBC spot begins with an ode to “50 years of laughs” before the “Hacks” star gets bored by the walk down memory lane
Jean Smart is excited to kick of “Saturday Night Live” Season 50 as a first-time host — she just wants a little more of it to be about her. 
In a newly released promo for the gig on Wednesday, the “Hacks” Emmy winner grows increasingly frustrated that she’s promoting “50 years of laughs” and walk-down-memory-lane clips instead of focusing on her.

“You’re not actually going to show a clip from every sea–,” she manages to get out between quick cuts of Dan Aykroyd, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Gilda Radner and others. 
“You cut me off, and that’s kind of ru–,” she says next before resorting to a shout: “Knock it off already, all right?! Jeez.”
“So anyway, as I was saying. I’m very pleased to be hos–,” and it goes on from there.

Smart was among the first string of A-list hosts and musical guests announced for Season 50 last Wednesday. Her episode with Jelly Roll airs live this Saturday, Sept. 28. 
The “Hacks” star is just one big-name performer who will be leading this historic season. Nate Bargatze, Ariana Grande, Michael Keaton and John Mulaney will host in the coming weeks. They will be accompanied by Coldplay, Stevie Nicks, Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan, respectively. Here’s the full schedule to date below:
The lineup for “Saturday Night Live” is always strong, but this one is especially exciting, likely owing to the history-making season of the NBC staple.
