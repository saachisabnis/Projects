Macklemore, the Seattle-born rapper, has been removed from the Neon City Festival lineup in Las Vegas. This decision came after a video surfaced on social media showing the artist saying “F*** America” during a performance.
The 41-year-old musician, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, was initially announced as a headliner for the inaugural festival scheduled for late November. However, things took an unexpected turn.
“Due to unforeseen circumstances, Macklemore will no longer be performing at Neon City Festival,” the festival organizers stated. “We are excited to announce new artists joining the NCF lineup shortly.”
The controversy stems from Macklemore’s remarks at the recent “Palestine Will Live Forever Fest” in Seattle’s Seward Park. His comments didn’t sit well with many, including some of his hometown teams.
The Seattle Kraken and Seattle Sounders FC, in a joint statement, expressed their concern: “We believe that sports bring people together and unite us. We are aware of Macklemore’s increasingly divisive comments, and they do not reflect the values of our respective ownership groups, leagues, or organizations. We are currently evaluating our collective options on this matter.”
