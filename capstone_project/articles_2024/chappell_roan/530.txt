Home    Forums    Music    Grammy Nominations Reactions (Part 2)
 Would be undeserved, but knowing the Grammys it’ll probably happen. Ig it’s fine since she’s been robbed before. 
undeserved my ASS….Cowbow Carter is brilliant & the critics agree PERIOD
Chappell’s probably going 0/6 which sucks because she’s one of the few contenders this year deserving of a sweep. 
so who do you predict for BNA?????
Performers predictions:
Sabrina Carpenter
Chappell Roan
Beyoncé
Shaboozey
Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars – Die With A Smile
Billie Eilish
Kendrick Lamar
Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr
Muni Long
Taylor Swift and Post Malone – fortnight
Jon Batiste, Jacob Collier and Andre 3000 for In Memoriam segment
Charli XCX
Migs
my guess is she wanted an rnb nomination for Dolly Parton the same way she got LINDA MARTEL a rap grammy nomination
Maybe, although she supposedly submitted Bodyguard and Levii’s Jeans in R&B alongside Tyrant but they got moved to Pop. II Hands II Heaven should have made it in one of those categories.
Some of Beyoncé’s submission choices were questionable but she managed to get 11 nominations so whatever she did worked. 
Guys seriously what are Beyonce chances because why do I feel she is getting the Rihanna and Jay z treatment especially not campaigning. AOTY – She has the rnb and rap(split with Andre). Country most likely split with Taylor and Sabrina and prob 25% pop. Her biggest hurdle doe is the voters claiming she has had enough wins. If she can get them to actually vote for her she wins. 
Girl BEYONCÉ is not going home empty handed…thats literally not gonna happen be freaking foreal lmfao
Beyoncé won’t split R&B votes with Andre. If anything.. 100% of those votes will go to her. R&B voters are Beyonce’s biggest supporters. She probably has the most wins in that field.
Beyoncé could have quite easily got 15+ nominations if the submissions had been better. not sure why they were such a mess

Yep. Beyoncé left an easy nomination on the table not submitting to Music Film. Taylor certainly tried it (and failed). Hard to call 11 nods a disaster, but there could have been more. Reaching #100 would have been iconic.
Taylor and Posty will open with an eras tour inspired performance of Fortnight! 🤍
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Considering 4/5 of the American Roots Song nominees started with A, I imagine Ameriican Requiem would’ve had an easy time getting in, which would’ve gotten her to 100 and tied the record for most nominations in a single year (and she would’ve broken the record if AR was submitted and nominated for performance)

Her label did the same thing during the I Am… Sasha Fierce era. “Sweet Dreams” in Music Video over “Single Ladies” was certainly a choice. Her label trying to fraud “Scared of Lonely” into Urban/Alternative Performance was just…

Kendrick’s not performing. I’m sure there is a clause that stops him from performing at any shows prior to Super Bowl.
I know jazz can be versatile but I listened to André’s album and surprised this wasn’t in New Age instead

I don’t see Beyoncé, Taylor, or Kendrick performing, but the others are possible.

 I think that she didn’t submit there because you literally can’t watch the movie
