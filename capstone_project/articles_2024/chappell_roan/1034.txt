A summer in Iowa is not complete without an outing at a music festival.
This year, Hinterland Music Festival returns to Iowa during the first full weekend in August (August 2nd through August 4th).
The indie/pop/folk three-day event will bring in crowds from all over Iowa and beyond.
This music festival is located in St. Charles, Iowa which is not too far from Des Moines.
Hinterland takes place at the Avenue of the Saints Ampitheatre and the organizers bring in a stellar lineup of indie-folk/pop artists to the festival every single year.
If you plan on going this year, there's a few key things you should know.
Every single vehicle that will be entering the festival grounds will require a parking pass, which you can purchase here.
