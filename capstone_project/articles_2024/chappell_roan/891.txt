The first day of Hinterland Music Festival is over and I'm thirsty. 
The biggest music festival in the state of Iowa is taking place this weekend in rural Saint Charles, around 40 minutes south of Des Moines.
Fans crowd the barricade to watch The Last Dinner Party perform at Hinterland Music Festival on Friday, August 2, 2024, in St. Charles, Iowa.
The fest has featured headliners like Zach Bryan, Bon Iver and Phoebe Bridgers in the past, with a typical tally of more than 10,000 attendees. The 2024 lineup is stacked across the board, with 10 performers each day and headliners Hozier, Vampire Weekend and Noah Kahan.

Performers on Friday were: Hozier, Orville Peck, Hippo Campus, Sam Barber, The Last Dinner Party, Josiah and The Bonnevilles, Debbii Dawson, Valencia Grace, Molly Martin and Model/Actriz. 
Each day this weekend, we’re planning to have a recap of the highlights and lowlights from the previous day. 
Missouri-based artist Sam Barber performs at Hinterland Music Festival on Friday, August 2, 2024, in St. Charles, Iowa.
I'm starved for space, so this review doesn't get to the next viral country star, Sam Barber. Or the proud "gay cowboy" Orville Peck, who donned the diamond-studded Outfit Of The Day and wowed the crowd with "C'mon Baby Cry" and "Hexie Mountains."
But here are a few of the best and worst moments of Hinterland’s first day. 
After passing the almost literal mile-long line at the entrance, and making time for an interview with Friday performer Hippo Campus, the first song I heard on Friday was a perfect one: "Jesus Etc." The Wilco classic was covered as a duet by early afternoon act Josiah and The Bonnevilles and Mitch Cutts, of Saturday performer Richy Mitch & The Coal Miners.
Josiah and company are no stranger to a cover. They've made their mark on social media with rootsy, folk-pop versions of popular tracks like Chappell Roan's "Good Luck Babe" and Taylor Swift's "Anti-Hero." Despite its more somber tone, they did "Jesus Etc." justice. Cutts got the second verse. His limestone vocal timbre paired well with Josiah's steely voice. A few sound issues made the song an uphill battle at first, but it was worth climbing. 
I heard through the grapevine that water access was a problem at last year's festival, and thankfully, this year's Hinterland crew expanded the amount of water filling stations. However, the amount of fans expanded, too. So the line to fill up your water bottle — at one of the few stations on festival grounds — consistently tallied over 100 fans at a time. That's just not enough access.

The issue will hopefully change on Saturday, because the festival announced it would be allowing outside water in the grounds, in response to social media pushback.
"We’ve heard your feedback," the festival posted. "Our team is continuously working to make the festival a great experience for everyone."
I'll admit it. I wasn't all that thrilled for The Last Dinner Party. I enjoy their breakout single "Nothing Matters," but the ABBA-goes-Renaissance-painting style on their debut "Prelude To Ecstasy" didn't really appeal to me. On stage at Hinterland, it was a different story.

Vocalist Abigail Morris' frantic stage choreography gave each song some extra legs. Unreleased track "The Killer" was the best of them all. It turns out that TLDP's theatrical, triumphant catalog is built for a big stage, and a Spotify file just isn't enough to capture it.
Word about the great lineup must have got around, because returning fans around the grounds indicated that the Hinterland crowd this year has at least a few thousand more people than last year.

That part is obvious. Hinterland 2024 looks like Disneyland on a stimulant. And the highs were in the mid-90 degrees. The combination of crowds, heat and slim water supply made the first day, at best, frustrating, and at worst, dangerous. 
At least a half dozen times during the day, bands had to stop their set to get security's attention for a fan who fainted in the pit. Hippo Campus had to pull a double-play and start over their song "baseball" twice. It was momentarily scary every time, and I hope security can appropriately distribute water to the barricade campers on Saturday.
It turns out "Take Me To Church" is not just a great song. It's a thesis for a Hozier show, too. Hands were raised, "Amen" was shouted — on Friday night, the lovable folk-rockstar was the final act of the night on the main stage, and he took us all to the pews.

Now 11 years removed from the release of "Take Me," it's remarkable to see Hozier as a headliner now. But it's especially endearing that he rose to this level not with a few gimmicks, but with a steady drip of stellar rock songs over a decade of cultural relevancy.
It's a testament to Hozier's songwriting and musical dexterity, which was on display on Friday. Flanked by a seven-person band that included choir singers and two keyboardists, the six-foot-six, luscious-locked power forward of a singer ran the gamut of his most well-known hits.
"Jackie and Wilson" and "From Eden" had the crowd of thousands glued to the stage. The crushing wall of power chords and drums on the breakdown for "Francesca" added balance to its setlist successor "Cherry Wine," an acoustic crusher apt for performance under rural Iowa's galaxy skies. 
The most powerful moment came before "Nina Cried Power," a song co-written by Mavis Staples and dedicated to the American Civil Rights movement, whose title references Nina Simone. Hozier prefaced the song with a lengthy speech about the value of sticking up for your neighbors on a political level. The Irish singer urged festivalgoers to contact their representatives and ask for peace in Palestine. 
"I grew up in a peaceful Ireland as a result of international involvement," he said.
It was clear at the end of the set that recent hit "Too Sweet" may have trumped "Take Me To Church" as Hozier's new signature song, considering the exodus of fans after the former, minutes before the latter.
"Too Sweet" doesn't exactly work as a mission statement, but it does work as a descriptor for the feeling in your gut walking home from a Hozier show. Cheers to the Irishman.

I went in to the Model/Actriz performance without knowing their catalogue. The show started just after 12:30 a.m. at the Raccoon Motel Campfire Stage. The sort-of-secret stage is tucked in a cool, grassy ravine, and attracted a crowd of just a few hundred fans on Friday, many of whom were Quad-Citians. 
Molly Martin plays on the Campfire Stage, a smaller concert sponsored by Raccoon Motel, at Hinterland on Friday, August 2, 2024, in St. Charles, Iowa.
Molly Martin, who opened the stage, described Model/Actriz's sound as "a mosquito strapped to an electric chair." I'm here to confirm that that is an accurate and stellar definition. I raise her this one: audio of a train derailment, played at 10-percent speed. It absolutely rocked. 
Dressed in all-black except for a bedazzled silver conductor's hat and frilled elbow-height gloves, Model/Actriz singer Cole Haden quickly earned the title of the most erratic and entertaining performer I've ever seen. The lanky, emotive singer meandered through the Campfire Stage crowd, walking at least 40 yards into the lawn to gyrate, seductively twirl a black boa and sing in fans' ears.

The music itself was a magnetic, metal mix of club beats and industrial synths. You could feel the bass under your ribcage, in the space between your muscles and your bones, in the saliva in the back of your throat. Just after 1 a.m., Haden applied lip gloss and lit a cigarette for a throat-scraping medley of lyrics from performers from earlier in the day like Orville Peck and The Last Dinner Party.
It was the perfect finale for an imperfect first day. As a clear musical outlier, Model/Actriz reset my palate (and my eardrums) for day two. Let's just hope everyone can stay hydrated.
