Keira Knightley is done having kids solely due to the existence of one animated TV series. 
The Pride & Prejudice star shares 9-year-old daughter Edie and 5-year-old daughter Delilah with husband James Righton, per People. During a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Knightley hilariously quipped that there will be no more kids because she does not enjoy watching "Peppa Pig."
"You know that thing where you’re like ‘Oh, you know they’re so nice. Should we have another one?' And you think, 'Oh yeah, I could do the pregnancy. I could even do the birth but I cannot watch anymore Peppa Pig. So there's no more kids."
The Black Doves standout unveiled that she had to watch 7 years of the popular animated series, and is very glad her children are now into "Japanese movies by Studio Ghibli."
Speaking of what her "cool" children prefer, 9-year-old Edie is a big fan of artists like Chappell Roan and Lizzo and Knightley recently helped her plan a disco-themed birthday party. Much to the actress's dismay, Edie found her mother's party preparations to be totally "embarrassing," and asked her to stand in a corner. 
"You know when they're teenagers, you think ‘Yeah, they're gonna find me embarrassing.’ But yeah, but 9, right? 'Mom, mom you are so embarrassing, just go and stand in the corner,'...It was awful."
