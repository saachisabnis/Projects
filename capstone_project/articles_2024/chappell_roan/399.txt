Outside Lands returns to San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park August 9 – 11. Organizers unveiled the three-day music festival’s 2024 lineup featuring headliners Tyler, the Creator, The Killers and Sturgill Simpson.
Simpson’s set marks his first full show in three years. Additionally, OSL vet Post Malone will present a “very special country set” at the festival. The Postal Service, Grace Jones, KAYTRANADA, JUNGLE, Snoh Aalegra, Gryffin, Young The Giant, ScHoolboy Q, Chappell Roan, Reneé Rapp, Victoria Monét and The Last Dinner Party are just a few of the other acts on the diverse 2024 Outside Lands festival.
“Every year we start with a blank canvas and because of the diverse and sophisticated palette of Bay Area music fans, we get to program a festival that is not only multigenerational but shows an incredible range of genres and musical subcultures,” noted Outside Lands co-founder Allen Scott in a statement. In addition to the music, the festival boasts top culinary options with Taste of the Bay Area as well as Wine Lands, Beer Lands and Cocktail Magic. There’s also Grass Lands for cannabis connoisseurs.
