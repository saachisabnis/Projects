Chappell Roan thinks fame can feel "abusive".
Chappell Roan has struggled to cope with fame

The 26-year-old singer has enjoyed huge success in recent years - but Chappell believes there can be a heavy price to pay for fame and success.

She told The Face magazine: "I feel like fame is just abusive.

"The vibe of this – stalking, talking s*** online, [people who] won’t leave you alone, yelling at you in public – is the vibe of an abusive ex-husband. That’s what it feels like. 

"I didn’t know it would feel this bad."

Despite this, Chappell still loves getting positive feedback from her fans.

The 'Femininomenon' hitmaker said: "Everyone’s like, ​‘Oh yeah, she’s really intense,’ which, whatever, fine.

"But I don’t very often get: ​‘Oh my God, you have such a good vibe.’ I think that just stems back to childhood, of [wanting] people to believe that I’m a good person and me believing it, too. So it means a lot when I hear that.

"I can’t read my DMs anymore, because I cry so much.

"But when people are like, ​‘Whatever you’re doing, it helped me’ - I don’t think any award or any money or whatever can be exchanged for that compliment. I don’t care about anything else, except giving space to people to be free. Because that’s what I needed so bad: freedom."

Earlier this month, Chappell revealed that she met with Sabrina Carpenter to discuss their experiences of fame.

The music star feels like Sabrina and herself have been on a similar journey in recent years.

Chappell told Rolling Stone magazine: "We’re both going through something so f****** hard … she just feels like everything is flying, and she’s just barely hanging on. It was just good to know someone else feels that way."
