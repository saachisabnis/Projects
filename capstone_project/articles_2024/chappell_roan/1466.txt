“We don’t need to make America great again. Come on. We are great. All we need is to work together again"
Harrison Ford has endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ahead of the US election.
In a pair of clips recirculated by Harris’ rapid response page on X/Twitter, the actor explained his choice to tell people he had never met “who I’m voting for and why” after 64 years of voting.
This year marks the first time he has ever endorsed a president, and though he notes in the video he didn’t agree with every policy from the Harris Walz campaign, he said: “These two people believe in the rule of law.
“They believe in science. They believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans, they believe that we are in this together. These are ideas I believe in. These are people I can get behind.”
Harrison Ford: When dozens of former members of the Trump administration are sounding alarms saying ‘For God's sake, don't do this again,’ you have to pay attention. They're telling us something important. I've got one vote, same as anyone else, and I'm going to use it to move… pic.twitter.com/C4m4x2Y2qv

Touching on Republican candidate Donald Trump, Ford said he had spent four years “turning us against each other while embracing dictators and tyrants” around the world.
“That’s not who we are,” he continued. “We don’t need to make America great again. Come on. We are great. All we need is to work together again. All we need is a president who works for all of us again.”
In a second follow-up video, Ford addresses how former members of Trump’s administration have come out to say they are not voting for him. “When dozens of former members of the Trump administration are sounding alarms, saying, ‘For God’s sake, don’t do this again’ – you have to pay attention,” he said.
“Kamala Harris will protect your right to disagree with her” is one of the most powerful statements made yet in support of this ticket.

“Kamala Harris will protect your right to disagree with her about policies or ideas,” he added. “And then, as we have done for centuries, we’ll debate them, we’ll work on them together, and we’ll move forward.
He wrapped up the clip by concluding: “The other guy, he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge. I’m Harrison Ford. I’ve got one vote, same as anyone else, and I’m going to use it to move forward. I’m going to vote for Kamala Harris.”
He joins a growing body of entertainment world figures backing Harris, who has drawn support from Beyoncé, Charli XCX, Joni Mitchell, Chappell Roan, Megan Thee Stallion, Cher, Lizzo, Eminem, Usher, P!nk, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bad Bunny, Bon Iver, Quavo, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Mumford & Sons, Amy Lee of Evanescence and Finneas.
