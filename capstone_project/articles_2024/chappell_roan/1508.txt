SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Chappell Roan’s 2024 just got even better.
Rolling Stone magazine named the Willard, Mo., native’s song “Good Luck, Babe!” the best song of 2024. The song reached 1 billion Spotify plays for the year.
The magazine described the song as “Eighties New Wave-meets-Nineties soft rock in its pop perfection, as Roan dedicates the song to a lover who is afraid to admit to her world and herself that she likes girls. She howls the year’s most iconic bridge, the type of musical moment destined to become the stuff of karaoke legend for decades to come. As catchy as it is raw, Roan’s only released song of this year catapulted her to megastar status and brought all her other songs with it. It’s a pop fairytale that’s not ending any time soon.”
