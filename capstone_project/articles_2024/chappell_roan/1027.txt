Chappell Roan made her Saturday Night Live debut as the musical guest on this past weekend’s episode. Roan performed her hit single “Pink Pony Club” and unveiled a new country song entitled “The Giver” for her performances on the NBC sketch comedy show. 
Comedian John Mulaney hosted the installment featuring Roan. The episode was the last before Election Day and featured a surprise appearance from Kamala Harris.
Chappell Roan started her time on SNL by performing her signature song, “Pink Pony Club.” Initially released as a single in 2020, the cut was also issued on the pop star’s 2023 debut studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess.
Roan returned to the Saturday Night Live stage to premiere “The Giver.” Chappell Roan wore country gear, and her band was dressed in country western apparel as well. “Take it like a taker, ’cause baby I’m a giver / Ain’t no need to help me, ’cause baby I deliver / Ain’t no country boy quitter / I get the job done,” Roan sang in the chorus of the catchy song.
“All you country boys saying you know how to treat a woman right? / Well, only a woman knows how to treat a woman right!” shouted Roan during the bridge. The singer and her band performed in front of an array of animated animals.
