Taylor Swift delivered heartfelt remarks about her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, when she accepted the coveted Video of the Year award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday night (September 11). Swift took the stage at UBS Arena in New York City at the end of the show when she won the honor for “Fortnight,” her collaboration with Post Malone that appears on her latest full-length record, The Tortured Poets Department.
“I would always just hear, like, someone, like, cheering and like, ‘woo!,’ from across the studio where we were shooting it [the video]. That one person was my boyfriend, Travis. Everything this man touches turns to happiness, fun and magic, so I want to thank him,” Swift said as the crowd wildly applauded and cheered.
Swift was a leading nominee at the 2024 show, which honors the most iconic moments in videos and music throughout the year. She and Posty also won in the Best Collaboration, Best Editing, Best Direction and Song of the Summer categories for “Fortnight.” The star-studded evening also included epic performances by Camila Cabello, Chappell Roan, GloRilla, Halsey, Lenny Kravitz, LL COOL J, Megan Thee Stallion, Sabrina Carpenter, Fat Joe, Eminem and more, plus tons of behind-the-scenes celeb sightings you didn’t see on TV.
