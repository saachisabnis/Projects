NEW YORK - Chappell Roan debuted a new country song "The Giver (She Gets The Job Done)" on Saturday Night Live.
The lesbian country song is a new sound for the pop star, but the catchy tune celebrates the feminist lyrics for which Roan is known.
"All you country boys saying you know how to treat a woman right," sings Roan. "Well, only a woman knows how to treat a woman right."
Roan's 2023 album "The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess" became an overnight sensation with popular hits "Pink Pony Club," "Red Wine Supernova," and "HOT TO GO!"
The singer has been debuting songs from her presumed next album. Roan debuted "The Subway" earlier in June at Bonnaroo, the single has yet to be released on streaming platforms.
It has yet to be announced when her next album will be released.
