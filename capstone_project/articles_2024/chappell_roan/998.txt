Off her major label debut Same Trailer Different Park, “Follow Your Arrow” introduced listeners to Kacey Musgraves’ penchant for clever wordplay. It also established Musgraves as an artist unafraid to go against the grain: You’re damned if you do, and you’re damned if you don’t / So you might as well just do whatever you want. Since releasing the 2014 CMA Song of the Year, the 36-year-old Texan has dabbled in everything from dance music to folk. But a recent tour stop saw Musgraves returning to her roots with a beautifully stripped-down version of “Follow Your Arrow.”
Kacey Musgraves kicked off her Deeper Well World Tour Wednesday (Sept. 4) at the Bryce Jordan Center in State College, Pennsylvania. And the “High Horse” singer had a surprise up her sleeve.

“You guys came to the party in such a big way, that is way bigger than that will ever be,” she told the crowd. “So thanks, this is for you.
The audience cheered, and Musgraves continued. “Also, your internet bullying has paid off, because I haven’t played this song live in about, I don’t know, a decade,” she said. “So you f—ing win, OK?”
The GRAMMY winner strummed on her guitar and sang the familiar first line: If you save yourself for marriage, you’re a bore. Over the crowd’s delighted shrieks, she launched into a bare-bones rendition of “Follow Your Arrow.”
The performance took on the moodier, more introspective tones of Deeper Well, her fifth studio album. It was a bit jarring compared to the plucky original—but still a beautiful reminder to stay true to yourself. Can’t win for losin’, you’ll just disappoint ’em / Just ’cause you can’t beat ’em, don’t mean you should join ’em.
Kacey Musgraves shares a few commonalities with rising pop sensation Chappell Roan. Both are popular among drag queens. Both have a fondness for bitingly self-aware wordplay and sparkles. Last night (Wednesday, Sept. 4) Musgraves paid tribute to pop’s newest “it” girl with her own spin on “Pink Pony Club.”

When it comes to the industry’s latest batch of pop princesses, Musgraves has already demonstrated a willingness for collaboration over competition. She joined Sabrina Carpenter last month for a surprise duet of Nancy Sinatra’s “These Boots Are Made For Walkin.’”
