Chappell Roan, one of the breakout stars of 2024, was not a headliner at Lollapalooza this week. But you wouldn’t know that from looking at the massive crowd that gathered in Chicago.
Waves of fans packed the city’s Grant Park to see the singer, who emerged on the main stage Thursday in a wrestling-inspired bodysuit and luchador mask. Thousands of concertgoers sang along to her hit songs like “Hot to Go!”
Lollapalooza is one of the world’s largest music festivals, with a daily capacity of 115,000 people this year, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Lollapalooza was started in 1991 as a tour for the the rock band Jane’s Addiction. In settled in 2005 as an iconic Chicago festival.
Headliners this year include Megan Thee Stallion, SZA, Blink-182, the Killers, the Future X, Metro Boomin, Hozier, Stray Kids, Melanie Martinez and Skrillex.
Jane’s Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell told the Tribune that he gets a few “tasty picks” on the festival’s lineup ever year, citing “Laufey, performing Friday evening with the Chicago Philharmonic, as well as the Thursday acts Last Dinner Party and Blondshell.”
As to why Roan wasn’t a headliner, Farrell told the Tribune it “happened so fast.” He added: “It’s all because of the internet that that happened so fast.”
