Shaboozey’s crossover hit, “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” jumps up to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart this week, the first number one song in his blossoming career. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)’ also sits atop the Hot Country Songs chart this week, making the first time that a Black man has topped both charts at the same time. Shaboozey becomes just the second Black artist overall to achieve the feat, after Beyoncé did it earlier this year with “Texas Hold ‘Em.” 
Elsewhere in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 5, Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, drops to No. 2, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” stays at No. 3, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” sticks at No. 4, and Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” moves up a spot to No. 5. Carpenter’s previous No. 1 single, “Please Please Please,” drops to No. 6, while Chappell Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!” gives the singer her first ever Top 10 charting single, coming in at No. 10 this week.
