Throughout 2024, music lovers watched as country music took center stage. Not only welcoming rising stars like Lainey Wilson and Jelly Roll, but country music also played host to singers like Post Malone and Beyonce. For Malone, he entered country music with his newest album F-1 Trillion and Beyonce released her debut country album with Cowboy Carter. With Wilson declaring “Country’s Cool Again” with her new song, it seems that Chappell Roan might be looking to go country when she performed her newest song “The Giver” on Saturday Night Live. 
Taking the stage on SNL, Roan started the night off with a performance of her hit song “Pink Pony Club.” While fans loved the performance, the highlight of the night came towards the end when Roan showcased “The Giver.” With the stage and band covered in country attire, the singer sang verses like, “When you need the job done, call me, baby. Cause you ain’t gotta tell me. It’s just in my nature. Take it like a taker, cause baby I’m a giver.”
