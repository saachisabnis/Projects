Chappell Roan is standing up for herself.
The 26-year-old momentarily stopped posing for photos on the red carpet at the premiere of Netflix’s concert film Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour in Los Angeles to confront a photographer she alleged acted rude to her at a past event.
“You were so disrespectful to me at the Grammys,” she told the person, as seen in multiple videos shared on social media, which does not show their face. “You yelled at me at the Grammy party. Yes, I remember. You were so rude to me. And I deserve an apology for that. You need to apologize to me.”
The “Good Luck Babe” singer later said, “No, no, no, you need to apologize” before a woman working at the event gently coaxed her away.
The identity of the photographer has not been revealed.
This is not the first time Chappell has confronted someone at a celebrity event over alleged rude behavior.
