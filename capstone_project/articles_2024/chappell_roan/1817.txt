The name on everyone's lip this summer is without a doubt Chappell Roan. The popstar is your "favorite artist's favorite artist" — and judging by a video taken at the SPCA of Wake County, is probably your dog's favorite artist too. One Pittie even dressed up like the singer to celebrate Pride month and enter the shelter's Pride Pawrade. Now video of the dog doing her best "pink pony girl" impression is too cute.
A "pawrade" goer caught the whole adorable walk in a video that's gone viral online.
The clip shows the Pittie slowly walking into the room to the song, while her handler leads her on her leash. Fittingly, she's wearing a pink cowboy hat and shiny pink vest. The audience loved it. People couldn't stop laughing — the costume was a hit.

Something about that tough little Pit Bull face wrapped in all that pink really is just precious.
"Waaaait for it," the woman who shot the video joked in the caption.
People in the comments section couldn't get enough. "She is THE pink pony girl," joked one person. "Your favorite dog's favorite dog," another commenter teased. "Why did this make me emotional?" a third commenter wondered.
Although many people joked that they thought Little Sebastian, the miniature horse from Parks and Rec, was going to appear when they first watched the clip. "Close enough, welcome back Lil' Sebastian," someone joked.
Sadly, the "pink pony pup" didn't win the competition that day. But her stint as the parade's Chappell Roan did raise awareness for a good cause. The SPCA of Wake County is an animal welfare agency based in Raleigh, North Carolina.
They offer many services to help animals; including sheltering them, community education, and adoption services. They do so much! To keep all their wonderful programming, the organization needs volunteers and donations to support them. They rely heavily on private donations for their annual budget. Even a small donation can contribute to the care and health of the animals that stay with them.
If you want to donate to the SPCA you can make a monthly donation, or even a one time donation can really go a long way. You can also purchase items off their wishlist — or run a fundraiser online for your family and friends.
Helping can come in so many forms. And know that however you give, it'll help so many animals that deserve a good and safe place to live.
