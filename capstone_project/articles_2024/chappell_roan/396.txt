Perhaps the only silver lining to one very orange cloud 
Perhaps the only silver lining to Donald Trump‚Äôs election as the President of the United States has been the fictional cabinet memes to grace social media following his shocking win.
On November 5 Moo Deng‚Äôs prediction came true as Donald Trump was re-elected after his first stint in the White House from 2016 to 2020. The result was particularly hard for disenfranchised groups, many of which fear for their basic human rights going forward. Already, women are ditching their boyfriends and joining South Korea‚Äôs 4B movement.

For better or worse, Donald Trump memes have become a major feature of social media in 2024, from jokes about his ‚ÄúCheeto complexion‚Äù to mocking skits about his unique way of talking. Cabinet memes have already begun to pop up on X, which is rather ironic when you consider Elon Musk owns it.
The memes tap into the absurdity of Trump‚Äôs cabinet selections, suggesting celebrities, influencers, and even fictional characters for some of America‚Äôs most important roles. The most successful memes tend to make jabs at the celebrity too, like suggesting that Taylor Swift should be in the Department of Pollution as an obvious jab at her private jet usage.
