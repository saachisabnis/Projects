Time magazine has named Elton John their Icon of the Year in 2024. Sir Elton had plenty of quotable things to say in the interview, while also receiving praise from pop superstars Dua Lipa and Chappell Roan. John explained why he routinely turns down invites to appear as a judge on televised talent shows, “Being on TV all the time kills your career, kills your vibe, kills your charisma totally.” Roan said John was a mentor to her, calling him “one of the original queens” who advised her to be patient and “that the songs will come.” Lipa collaborated with John on “Cold Heart,” and said, “Singing alongside one of my musical heroes was a no-brainer. His music has been able to soundtrack my life from the very beginning.” 
John, who has been sober since 1990, also shared his opinion about legalizing weed. “I maintain that it’s addictive,” Elton said. “It leads to other drugs. And when you’re stoned — and I’ve been stoned — you don’t think normally. Legalizing marijuana in America and Canada is one of the greatest mistakes of all time.” (Billboard)
