Will be thinking about Chappell Roan for the next three business days.
New York’s hottest club isn’t another Lower East Side dive with cheap drinks—it’s actually Governor’s Ball music festival. At least, that’s what I experienced this past weekend as I made the trek from Brooklyn to Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens (yes, I went abroad across boroughs for this, and I have no regrets). I met up with my fellow Cosmo editors for some music and good vibes, and while I’ve touched down at a few festivals—and a ton of shows in general—over the years, this was actually my first time experiencing Gov Ball in all its glory. So to have the undeniable energy of a music festival married with the mystifying magic of New York all in one place felt like a dreamscape, especially with a lineup as good as this one. I’m talking Post Malone, The Killers, Peso Pluma, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, and Chappell Roan—and then, there’s more.
We bounced around sets all weekend, and honestly? Jogging across festival grounds was totally worth it as Gov Ball 2024 was one for the books. That’s why I tapped some Cosmo editors to share their favorite performances from the fest. Enjoy the pure fangirling/love fest/straight-up gushing that lies ahead!
Please, please, please Sabrina, do another tour ASAP. The rise of Sabrina has been such a fun thing to witness, especially as someone who has listened since her Singular era. She finally knows who her onstage persona is. Unlike other pop stars this weekend, she gave us both vocals and dancing presence. She is the quintessential pop girlie who has learned from her predecessors and it shows. But the best part wasn’t even seeing her perform her new song—it was seeing the crowd sing “Because I Liked a Boy” at the top of their lungs. For a second, the persona faded away as she felt the crowd support her during a song where she felt the most alone. It surprises her and you can still feel it in the audience, which proves how far she’s come since then. And believe me, they’re here for the long run. Hopefully, she finally feels that too.

Posty, the hitmaker you are! I made my v tired, reluctant friends stay to watch the headliner's late-night performance, and at the start of every song they'd turn to me and say, "Oh, I forgot he sang this!". And yes, they both walked out of there with their Spotify app open, adding his songs to their playlist. Post Malone's quite literal firework performance was just so fun and a reminder that he's mastered jumping from one genre to the next. His rendition of “I Had Some Help" has me campaigning for a full country album next, but perhaps more so reminiscent of Cowboy Carter and less so alongside featured artists like he-who-shall-not-be-named.

I’m obsessed, no notes. Post Malone knocked it out of the park—and this is coming from someone who was apprehensive about how he’d be live because of his soft, raspier tone. He had me dancing, singing, and honestly, screaming with joy (and rage, IYKYK, lol), the whole time and I truly wish I could relive it.

As someone who’s followed Chappell Roan since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic (thank you, TikTok!), it’s been such a pleasure to watch her star rise. Since she dropped “Pink Pony Club” in 2020, the pop-star-meets-drag persona has grown into her own—even through early-aughts Gaga comparisons. I first saw her live in October 2023 and even then, her stage presence was awe-inspiring. To see Chappell effortlessly command a massive crowd at Gov Ball to throw down “Hot to Go!” choreography dressed as the Statue of Liberty was next level, as well as her rightfully calling for liberation during her “My Kink Is Karma” speech. The energy in the audience reflected what she gave on stage, and at one point, I found myself breathless as I asked my friends, “Is she performing, or am I?” The answer is both—because a Chappell Roan show is a community in itself.

Gov Ball marked one of her best performances ever, from the outfits (Statue of Liberty coming out of a giant apple! A taxi cab dress complete with air freshener earrings!) to debuting a new song. The “Am I Gay?” quiz opening animation, her speaking out about human rights, and—obviously—the VOCALS were everything. I’m going to be obsessing over her performance all year.

Watching Chappell Roan onstage at Gov Ball felt like one of those moments you tell your kids you were fortunate enough to be at. It’s rare to see an artist this fully formed and grounded in their stage performance and persona. From the crowd bursting out in a perfectly cued “Hot to Go” dance to the grand entrance she made in Lady Lib drag, this was Chappell at her peak. She’s your favorite artist’s favorite artist!

Reneé's such a charismatic performer, and her live vocals FLOORED me. I’ve been streaming “Talk Too Much” on repeat. As a child of the BeyHive, I’m usually not into the whole ~bare bones~ live performance vibe, but her energy really made it feel like a choir and a crew of backup dancers were present.
—Annabel Iwegbue, assistant editor
Aside from her jaw-dropping vocals, I was obsessed with her sardonic commentary between songs, genuine fan interactions, and outgoing stage presence for the entire set. Not only can she SING but her sarcastic and relatable personality shone through her performance. And for that, I am a forever stan.

There was a moment where Rauw Alejandro steps into his set that re-creates an NYC subway and it felt so, so New York. Flags were all over the crowd as the singer belted out some of his biggest hits. It felt like the ultimate Latin American experience as he paid homage to the city that helped raise him and the culture in his blood and roots. He’s leading the new generation of reggaeton and, dare we say, he might be its newest prince as he continues his takeover.

FLO really is the whole package—the girl group not only has style, but they effortlessly lay down harmonies and let their personalities shine onstage. They’re in sync in every sense, and despite their dancers nearly missing their performance, the trio carried it with their vocals. Their mics were very much on! I overheard someone in the crowd lovingly refer to them as Destiny’s Grandchildren, and while they’re right—FLO is so much more than that. While the girls pay homage to early 2000s and ’80s predecessors like Destiny’s Child and En Vogue, respectively, they bring a modern flair with infectious hooks and cheeky entendres on tracks like “Walk Like This” and “Cardboard Box.”

Doechii put on a SHOW. Her energy was absolutely electric and it radiated off the stage. I came in with no expectations and not being very familiar with her discography, and she had me face down, booty up. That’s when you know! 
—Meg Uy, associate shopping editor
The first chords of “Somebody Told Me” came on and it was like something unlocked in everyone in that crowd. There was such an infectious joy as they brought Las Vegas rock ‘n’ roll into the big city. It was a beautiful celebration of a band and their debut album which both turn 20 this year and I’m sure all of NYC heard the the final notes of “Mr. Brightside” even all the way to Brooklyn as everyone danced the night away especially as Brandon Flowers and the band sang the lyrics, “Are we human / Or are we dancers?” Well, for their entire hour-and-a-half set list, we were both.

Brit-pop darling Mimi Webb brought her posh accent and her buttery smooth vocals to New York’s Gov Ball. We all know I’m keen on my pop girls, so hers was the first set I caught all weekend—and it was worth sticking around for. Between up-tempo bops fit for girls’ night and piano ballads tinged with soul-bearing vocals and diary-entry lyricism, Miss Mimi is definitely one to watch.

If karma's real, what did I do to deserve witnessing this performance live?! Transcendent doesn't even begin to cover what it felt like watching SZA on stage. She gave heartbreak, yearning, devotion, and hopeless romanticism all in one. Ending her set with "20 Something" felt ever so bittersweet on the anniversary of CTRL's release and it's a testament to just how far she's come and the fruitful career she's built for herself. Every track included in this setlist proved that SZA is a no-skips artist. Like, look at the material! SZA walked off stage sharing just how grateful she was for her fans, but it's truly us who are lucky to see her vulnerability and artistry in real-time. 
—Daisy Maldonado, associate shopping editor
I saw SZA play Austin City Limits in 2022 with a similar stage setup, costumes, and set list—she just seemed to be having so much more fun this time! Especially with this being the anniversary of her debut album Ctrl, it felt like an amazing celebration of her career so far.

Not even a broken foot stopped this man from giving us a PERFORMANCE. Not only was it a big moment for Latinos and the corridos genre, but it was a fierce display of artistry vs. the public’s ideas of an artist based on their art. With special guests, a slanted stage, a full band, and the energy of a man giving it his all, Peso Pluma proved to the giant crowd that he is the present and future of Latin music.
—Tamara Fuentes, entertainment editor
Dominic Fike is the Florida Man™️. And, no, I’m not referring to the chaotic headlines that helm from my home state. The Florida-born musician’s effortlessly cool stage presence shined through as he swapped between acoustic and electric guitars and played with vocal effects and chatty interludes. From spontaneously riffing the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Can’t Stop” for a blip to performing his hit “Baby Doll” with the crowd and bouncing between his Spider-Man pop banger “Mona Lisa” and his Paul McCartney reimagination “Kiss of Venus,” Dominic’s talent and charisma oozed with ease and proves he’s in it for the long run.
—Sam Olson, assistant news editor
One girl in the crowd called me a true CRJ stan because I knew EVERY WORD, but as soon as she got on that stage to sing “Now That I Found You,” Governor’s Ball turned into a grand dance club. “Psychedlic Switch” had the crowd doing their best disco moves and it all came to a grand end with “Cut to the Feeling” and Carly Rae Jepsen continuing the prophecy by receiving two swords from the crowd. The same girl left as a new fan and to  her, I say, “Welcome to the club; it’s a fun place to be!”

I've been following Ryan Beatty since his teen heartthrob days, and it’s so refreshing to see gen-pop gain a new appreciation for his evolving talent. From collaborations with Brockhampton and Beyoncé over the years to honing his songwriting chops and peeled-back production on 2023’s Calico, Ryan was fully in his element as he sat on a stool, plucked the strings of his guitar, and opted for oversized headphones in place of in-ears.
