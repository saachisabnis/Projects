Marsha Kearney, the mother of injured Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice, was arrested in relation to a viral incident that took place last month, TMZ Sports reports.
Kearney was charged with mail theft in relation to an incident in which Ring camera previously obtained by TMZ Sports showed Kearney stealing a package from her neighbor while wearing a custom "Momma-Rice" Chiefs jersey with her son's number on September 29, shortly after her son suffered a knee injury during the Chiefs' road win against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 4. Kearney then returned to the door, slid a package onto the ground with her foot, wrongfully suspecting it was moved out of the frame of the camera, and lifting it with her feet before walking away.
The package reportedly contained two limited-edition Chappell Roan vinyls purchased from Urban Outfitters and the buyer tried to work with Kearney, Rice and their apartment complex to get the items back before filing a report with police on October 2. The incident was the latest in what has been a tumultuous few months for Rice since winning the Super Bowl as a rookie in February.
The 24-year-old was arrested for an alleged assault incident in Dallas -- though the victim requested not to pursue charges -- in May, one month after being arrested in relation to a six-vehicle crash that took place in the same city. Rice was carted off the field during the first quarter of the Chiefs' Week 4 game after colliding with quarterback Patrick Mahomes while attempting to tackle Kristian Fulton on an interception return.
Rice recorded 24 receptions for 288 yards and two touchdowns prior to his season-ending injury.
