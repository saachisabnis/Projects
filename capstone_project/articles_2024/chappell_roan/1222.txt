Chappell Roan is just absolutely going for it. Still on the ascent via last year’s breakout debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess and currently on a sold-out headlining tour and an opening arena slot run for Olivia Rodrigo, which just rolled through town, the modern queer icon delivered another sticky-sweet alt-pop bop this past Friday (April 5) in “Good Luck, Babe,” a seductive synth ballad that explores leaving behind a romantic relationship to explore authentic love and self-acceptance. “I needed to write a song about a common situationship within queer relationships — where someone is struggling with coming to terms with themselves,” Roan reveals. “It’s a song about wishing well to someone who is avoidant of their true feelings.” We’ve written a lot on Roan over the past few months, so hit the link and join us up front when she plays Boston Calling next month.
