In a new interview with The Guardian, Chappell Roan has revealed that she has recently been diagnosed with severe depression. Roan’s interview with the British newspaper was published while the pop superstar is on a brief U.K. and European Leg of her Midwest Princess Tour, which finishes up at the Velodrom in Berlin on Monday (September 23). “I went to a psychiatrist last week because I was like, I don’t know what’s going on,” Roan disclosed. “She diagnosed me with severe depression — which I didn’t think I had because I’m not actually sad. But I have every symptom of someone who’s severely depressed.” Roan’s depression symptoms include brain frog, poor focus, forgetfulness, and “a very lackluster viewpoint.” “I think it’s because my whole life has changed,” she shared. “Everything that I really love to do now comes with baggage.” The 26-year-old Roan was previously diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder at the age of 22.
