Hollywood star Angelina Jolie was swept up in a mob of fans as one raced past security to hug her waist while she was at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). 
The Oscar-winning actor, 49, attended the Canadian film festival for the premiere of her war drama, Without Blood (which she co-wrote and directed) starring Salma Hayek and Demian Bechir.
‘As a director, Angelina Jolie has made a decisive turn from her glamorous on-screen image, crafting thoughtful dramas that illuminate the horrors war visits on individuals,’ TIFF wrote about the drama, based on the novel by Alessandro Baricco.
The movie follows a woman who is on the path of revenge after she comes face to face with the man who brutally murdered her father and brother.
At one point during the premiere, Angelina had her own battle to fight as a flurry of fans descended on the veteran screenstar.
As multiple videos show, Angelina admirably attempted to sign autographs and pose for selfies when one bold fan scurried past security and grabbed the actor’s waist where she then attempted to hug her.

Hold my purse, did someone say ANGELINA JOLIE?! 😱 🤩 The one and only just stepped out in Toronto for the TIFF 2024 red carpet 🥳 #ForYou #Fyp #Toronto #tiff2024 #TIFF24 #AngelinaJolie 
After the initial shock, one sweet moment shows Angelina embracing her right back as the two chatted.
Eventually, the girl was escorted away before Angelina turned around to continue interacting with her adoring fanbase. 
Although the A-lister handled the unexpected situation like a pro, online fans shared their relief that the situation didn’t turn more serious or sinister.
‘Thankfully the fan seemed harmless. Angelina Jolie is a legend for how she handled this. The kindness,’ @bstart515 wrote on X. 
‘Angelina handled that so great and she even told the security to be nice when the fan was being escorted out,’ @Scoby20 shared. 
‘That’s quite a security breach! Glad Angelina Jolie is okay despite the fan’s bold move,’ @harrisdeva reflected. 
Others pointed out that fans need to learn the meaning of ‘personal space’.
Neither Angelina nor her team have publicly addressed the concerning interaction.
The eyebrow-raising incident comes as the discourse around fans overstepping boundaries sparked up again after popstar Chappell Roan slammed some people’s ‘predatory behavior’.
‘I’ve been in too many nonconsensual physical and social interactions and I just need to lay it out and remind you, women don’t owe you sh**.
‘I chose this career path because I love music and art and honouring my inner child, I do not accept harassment of any kind because I chose this path, nor do I deserve it,’ she said in a statement
Meanwhile, during the film festival, Angelina opened up about the process of adapting the novel which does not specify when or where it is set. 
At a post-screening Q&A, she said: ‘He said to me, when I first met with Baricco, “They’re going to force you to change the end, they’re going to force you to pick a country, they’re going to force you to decide what year it is. Try to hold, because this is what it’s intended to be.”‘
According to Deadline, she added: ‘Now I think back, he was almost challenging me, instead of warning me.’
This is not the only film the outspoken human rights advocate has debuted at this year’s film festival circuit. 
During the Venice Film Festival in August, the actor was brought to tears during an eight-minute standing ovation after the screening of Maria for her brilliant embodiment of the titular role of opera diva Maria Callasopera.
The director behind the movie also worked on 2016’s Jackie and 2021’s Spencer which landed leading ladies Natalie Portman and Kirsten Stewart Academy Award nominations.
