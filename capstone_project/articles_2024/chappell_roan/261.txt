Global superstars such as Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, and Chappell Roan graced The Video Music Awards earlier this week. However, it was Katy Perry who turned heads with her impressive abs.
After stepping away from her American Idol judging duties to focus on new music projects, including the hit 'Woman's World', Katy made a splash at the event. The mum-of-one dazzled not just with her performance but also with her red carpet look that showcased her toned stomach.
The 'California Girls' singer has been open about her lifestyle changes, revealing she "cut out sugar and processed foods" and embarked on a rigorous fitness regime alongside her partner Orlando Bloom. At 39, Katy is reportedly enjoying her fitness level, feeling both "sexy and confident".
The pop star has also spoken about how it's important to make time for fitness since becoming a mother. She welcomed a little girl, Daisy Dove, with Orlando back in August 2020. 
For those inspired to achieve Katy's physique, the journey to fitness might be more straightforward than expected. Fitness experts at Mirafit have suggested a series of exercises that can be done at home without any special equipment, all within an hour.
 These seven exercises are particularly effective for sculpting your body in the style of the 'Hot N Cold' artist, reports the Mirror. They focus on boosting your endurance through tough cardio sets - but you can start out gently and slowly build up to Katy's level. 
Elbow planks are superior for strengthening and toning your core compared to forearm planks, as they restrict movement from your upper body, therefore working those core muscles more intensely. Begin by lying on your stomach with your toes tucked in.
Then, gradually lift your body off the ground using your forearms, maintaining a straight line. Make sure your hips are tucked in, your shoulders are relaxed, and you engage your core by pulling your belly button into your body rather than towards the floor.
Start by holding the plank for 20 seconds and slowly increase the duration of the plank as you gain confidence and strength.
This exercise targets the lower abdomen and engages your core. Scissor kicks also work your glutes, quads and abductors.
Begin by lying on a mat on your back, facing the ceiling, and resting your arms by your sides, palms facing downwards. Push your lower back into the mat and tuck in your pelvis to start engaging the core.
Lift both legs off the mat at about a 45-degree angle, then lift one leg while lowering the other. Repeat this motion by alternating lifting and lowering each leg.
Remember to keep your core tight while doing this to ensure you truly feel the burn. Start with 10 reps (repetition of exercise) and increase depending on your ability and strength.
This exercise is fantastic for toning and strengthening your core, arms, back, shoulders and legs. Begin in a high plank position with your shoulders aligned over your wrists, your pelvis tucked in, and your ribs drawn towards your hips.
Draw one leg into your chest, maintaining the other leg in its initial position. Switch legs and repeat this for 45 seconds or longer if you can withstand the burn.
Ab crunches are excellent for toning and strengthening your abdominal muscles, specifically targeting the zone that defines your six-pack. Ab crunches differ from regular sit-ups in that your shoulders and upper back are lifted off the floor, adding an extra level of difficulty.
Start by lying on a mat with your feet flat on the floor and your knees bent, resting your arms on your thighs. Keep your lower back on the mat, but lift your shoulders and upper back off the mat by contracting your abs and pulling your sternum towards your belly button.
Slowly lower your shoulders and upper back onto the mat before repeating, and remember to breathe while lifting and lowering. Start with 12-15 reps and increase to three sets of 12-15 reps when you feel ready and strong enough.
If you're looking to take your ab crunches to the next level and challenge yourself further, give bicycle crunches a go. These work the same muscles as a standard ab crunch but also engage your internal and external obliques.
Similar to an ab crunch, start by lying on your back with your feet flat on the ground, shoulders slightly raised and chest lifted. Keep one leg straight, lift it off the ground, and bend the other towards your chest.
As you draw the knee towards you, bring the opposite elbow to the knee using a twisting motion. Alternate legs and repeat this around 10 times, gradually increasing when you feel capable.
This exercise is not only beneficial for your abs, but bird dogs also strengthen the hips and back and help with improving your posture. Begin on all fours, wrists under the shoulders and knees under your hips.
Ensure your back is flat and your core is engaged before lifting one arm out in front of you while raising the opposite leg straight at hip height. Draw both your arm and leg into your body so that they meet. Do 10-12 reps on each side and increase if you feel strong enough to do so.
This exercise is excellent at engaging your upper and lower abdomen, specifically targeting your rectus abdominis. Lie on your back with your legs in the air at a 90-degree angle, then press your lower back onto the mat with your shoulders lifted off the mat.
Extend your arms and try to reach your toes, then lower back down to the mat. To make this exercise a little more challenging and effective, hold a dumbbell and lift it towards your toes.
