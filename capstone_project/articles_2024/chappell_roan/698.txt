Missing Saturday night's show: Bad idea, right?
Olivia Rodrigo's "Guts" tour stop at Fiserv Forum was another testament to her rising status as a mega-force in pop and the music industry as a whole. Transforming the sold-out arena into a pulsating hub of youthful energy and raw emotion, Rodrigo took the stage and delivered a performance that was nothing short of spectacular. The “good 4 u” singer’s fans enjoyed an unforgettable experience on Saturday night that showcased her evolution as an artist, her profound connection with fans and her ability to turn a packed arena into an intimate space. 

Here are eight reasons why you shouldn’t have missed Olivia Rodrigo’s unforgettable performance at Fiserv Forum on Saturday night. 

1. She leveled up

Olivia Rodrigo's return to Milwaukee was a clear indication of her meteoric rise in the music industry. Having initially graced the stage at The Rave's Eagles Ballroom, a venue that holds around 3,500 fans, her latest performance at Fiserv Forum was a significant leap, with the arena boasting a capacity nearly five times that. This transition from a mid-sized venue to a large-scale arena not only highlights the exponential growth of Rodrigo's fan base but also showcases her readiness to take on larger stages and more elaborate productions. It's a testament to her escalating popularity and the broadening appeal of her music, marking a pivotal "level up" in her touring career. Next stop, American Family Field? 

2. Her evolving artistry

Rodrigo's latest LP, “Guts," and her accompanying tour have marked a significant evolution in her artistry, reflecting a matured sound with her sophomore project. With "Guts," Rodrigo delves deeper into the complexities of youth, heartache and self-discovery. This evolution was mirrored in her live performance, where the raw energy and emotional vulnerability of her debut album "Sour" were elevated to new heights with more sophisticated production and a dynamic stage presence, parallel to the new heights of her debut tour and the one that’s filling arenas across the country. 

With Rodrigo’s performance of "vampire" early into her set, the selection set the emotional tenor for the evening. The 21-year-old singer invited the audience into the vulnerable and reflective space that characterizes her new album. The track’s themes of longing and introspection resonate through her performance and deepened the audience's engagement throughout the show. 

3. “Sour” fans ate 
X
Despite being the “Guts" tour, Rodrigo ensured that fans of her debut album "Sour" were not left wanting. The setlist cleverly incorporated the vast majority of "Sour," with Rodrigo delivering heartfelt renditions of tracks like "traitor," "brutal," "drivers license," and "jealousy, jealousy," among others. By performing nearly all but a couple songs from her critically acclaimed debut, Rodrigo not only paid homage to the record that catapulted her to stardom but also bridged the emotional and thematic continuities between her first and second albums. This comprehensive inclusion of "Sour" tracks underscored Rodrigo's appreciation for her roots and the deep connection her fans have with her earlier work, plus it treated those who weren’t able to catch her at The Rave a couple years ago.







4. She took us to the moon and back 
X
During the middle of her set, Rodrigo created a magical moment that seemed straight out of a Dreamworks movie's opening credits, performing her ballad "logical" and her heartfelt “Sour” track "enough for you" atop a large illuminated crescent moon. This imaginative prop lifted her above the captivated crowd, carrying her gracefully through the sold-out arena. This enchanting spectacle not only highlighted the emotional depth of the songs but also showcased the enhanced production capabilities that come with an arena tour. 

5. Her dancing is "embarrassing" (... but not really) 
X
One of the standout moments of the concert was Rodrigo's performance of "love is embarrassing," which featured choreography from herself and her dancers that was both awkward and cringe-worthy yet exceptionally executed, perfectly capturing the song's essence. The dance moves would make Seinfeld’s Elaine Benes proud – although that reference might soar over the heads of Rodrigo's younger fans. The performance’s spirited execution and charming awkwardness made it a memorable part of the show. 

6. Girl power takes center stage 
X
The "Guts" tour is a beacon of girl power, featuring an all-female band, talented female backup dancers, a female opening act and, of course, your headlining act Olivia Rodrigo. Personally, this cast of talented female performers is no surprise as I witnessed her perform her first-ever full concert just a couple years ago with a historic set for PBS’ "Austin City Limits," marking the first time in the show's 47-season history that a female performer and all-female band took the stage. Rodrigo's commitment to showcasing female talent makes her a modern role model, empowering girls and young women in the music industry and beyond.

7. She put a cherry on top of an already memorable night 
X
The encore to Rodrigo's Milwaukee performance was a high-energy culmination that left the audience buzzing with excitement. Rodrigo ramped up the intensity with a spirited performance of "good 4 u," a track that has become an anthem since its release and is still perhaps her biggest song to date. The atmosphere, though, reached an even-higher fever pitch as she transitioned into "get him back!" from her latest LP, wielding a bright red megaphone that added a raw, rebellious edge to her performance. As the final notes rang out, glitter cascaded from rafters, transforming the arena into a shimmering spectacle. In a heartfelt gesture to say farewell to the sold-out room, Rodrigo descended into the crowd, giving out hugs and high-fives, embracing her "livies" and expressing gratitude for their unwavering support. 

8. Chappell Roan rewarded fans for showing up on time 
X
Chappell Roan's performance as the night’s opening act was a standout experience on its own, showcasing her emergence as a compelling new artist in pop. Her collaborations with Dan Nigro, Rodrigo's go-to producer, added a layer of musical depth and continuity between their sets, making her performance an easy fit into the evening. Roan's finale with "Pink Pony Club," her most popular song to date, alongside other tracks from her debut album, "The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess," captivated the audience with her unique sound and energetic presence, making her segment of the concert unforgettable.

One of the standout moments of the concert was Rodrigo's performance of "love is embarrassing," which featured choreography from herself and her dancers that was both awkward and cringe-worthy yet exceptionally executed, perfectly capturing the song's essence. The dance moves would make Seinfeld’s Elaine Benes proud – although that reference might soar over the heads of Rodrigo's younger fans. The performance’s spirited execution and charming awkwardness made it a memorable part of the show. 

6. Girl power takes center stage

The "Guts" tour is a beacon of girl power, featuring an all-female band, talented female backup dancers, a female opening act and, of course, your headlining act Olivia Rodrigo. Personally, this cast of talented female performers is no surprise as I witnessed her perform her first-ever full concert just a couple years ago with a historic set for PBS’ "Austin City Limits," marking the first time in the show's 47-season history that a female performer and all-female band took the stage. Rodrigo's commitment to showcasing female talent makes her a modern role model, empowering girls and young women in the music industry and beyond.

7. She put a cherry on top of an already memorable night

The encore to Rodrigo's Milwaukee performance was a high-energy culmination that left the audience buzzing with excitement. Rodrigo ramped up the intensity with a spirited performance of "good 4 u," a track that has become an anthem since its release and is still perhaps her biggest song to date. The atmosphere, though, reached an even-higher fever pitch as she transitioned into "get him back!" from her latest LP, wielding a bright red megaphone that added a raw, rebellious edge to her performance. As the final notes rang out, glitter cascaded from rafters, transforming the arena into a shimmering spectacle. In a heartfelt gesture to say farewell to the sold-out room, Rodrigo descended into the crowd, giving out hugs and high-fives, embracing her "livies" and expressing gratitude for their unwavering support.
