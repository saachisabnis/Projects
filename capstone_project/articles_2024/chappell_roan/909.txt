Miley Cyrus, the multi-talented entertainer who became a household name through her iconic role as Hannah Montana, has added another milestone to her already impressive career. On Sunday, August 11, the 31-year-old artist was honored as a Disney Legend during a ceremony at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. This recognition is not just another accolade for Miley; it solidifies her place in Disney’s storied history, making her the youngest person ever to receive this prestigious honor.
Taking the stage in a sleek suit, Miley was visibly emotional as she accepted the award. She was joined by her mother, Tish Cyrus, and her sister, Brandi Cyrus, who were there to support her on this monumental day. The ceremony was a celebration of Miley’s contributions to the Walt Disney Company, recognizing her not just for her role in the wildly successful Hannah Montana series, but for the indelible mark she has left on Disney’s legacy over the years.
As part of the ceremony, country music star and actress Lainey Wilson delivered a powerful performance of the Hannah Montana theme song, “Best of Both Worlds,” bringing back memories for fans of the show. The tribute didn’t end there; a special video montage was played, featuring heartfelt messages from John Travolta, Chappell Roan, and Bret Michaels, each reflecting on Miley’s journey and the impact she’s had on the entertainment industry.
When Miley took the stage to accept her award, she was overwhelmed with emotion, tearing up as she reflected on her career’s beginnings and the journey that led her to this moment. “I’m gonna let everybody get in on a little Disney Legend secret,” she began, her voice cracking with emotion. “I’m the one that tells you what you’re not supposed to know. And what I want to say is that legends get scared, too. I’m scared right now, but the difference is we do it anyway, and all of you can do that every single day. It’s legendary to be afraid and do it anyway. There is no such thing as failure when you try.”
Her words resonated deeply with the audience, a mixture of longtime fans and industry insiders who have watched her evolve from a Disney Channel star into a global superstar. Miley’s humility and honesty in that moment were a reminder of the genuine person behind the larger-than-life persona she’s cultivated over the years.
Miley also took a moment to reflect on the early days of Hannah Montana, a role that catapulted her into fame at a young age. “In 2005, Disney was on a mission to rebuild the company. That’s why they hired Bob Iger, and me,” she joked, bringing a lighthearted moment to her emotional speech. The audience responded with laughter, appreciating her wit and acknowledging the truth behind her humor—Hannah Montana was indeed a pivotal show for Disney during a time of transformation.
“I stand here still proud to have been Hannah Montana,” Miley continued, her voice filled with pride and nostalgia. “This award is dedicated to Hannah and all of her amazing, loyal fans, and to everyone who has made my dream a reality. To quote the legend herself, ‘This is the life.’”
The quote, a nod to one of Hannah Montana’s most memorable songs, was a fitting end to Miley’s speech, encapsulating the essence of her journey and the joy she’s brought to millions of fans worldwide.
