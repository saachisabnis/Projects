Eminem achieves his 11th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart (dated July 27) as his latest studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), debuts atop the list. The set launches with 281,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending July 18, according to Luminate. It scores the largest week for any rap album in 2024.

	With an 11th No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, Eminem ties Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and Ye (formerly Kanye West) for the fifth-most No. 1s on the Billboard 200. Ahead of them are The Beatles (a record 19 No. 1s), Jay-Z and Taylor Swift (each with 14) and Drake (13).

	










	Also in the top 10 of the new Billboard 200, three acts all debut with their highest-charting albums ever, as ENHYPEN, Clairo and Megan Moroney’s latest releases enter at Nos. 2, 8 and 9, respectively. Plus, after 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1, Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department spends its first week outside the top slot, falling to No. 4 in its 13th week on the list.

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new July 27, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 23.

	Of The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)’s 281,000 first-week units, SEA units comprise 164,500 (equaling 220.08 million on-demand official streams of the tracks on the streaming edition of the album; Death also debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 114,000 (all from digital downloads; it wasn’t available as a physical album) and TEA units comprise 2,500.

Death’s first-week sales mark the biggest sales week in 2024 for a rap album. It also nets the second-largest sales week this year for a digital download album, behind only the debut of Swift’s Poets with 274,000 downloads sold in its opening week.

	










Death was available to purchase only as a digital download and was issued widely in both clean and explicit editions, in addition to three further variants sold exclusively in Eminem’s official webstore. Of the latter three, two were sold as a pre-order for a limited time before the set’s release, and each came with their own exclusive bonus track — one with “Kyrie & Luka,” featuring 2 Chainz, and one with “Like My Shit,” featuring FIFTEENAFTER. A third webstore variant dropped on Wednesday (July 17), carrying both bonus tracks and an exclusive “Steve Berman” skit. The CD and vinyl editions of The Death of Slim Shady are due for release on Sept. 13 and Oct. 25, respectively.

	Eminem’s new album was preceded by two top 40-charting hits on the Billboard Hot 100, “Houdini,” which debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the June 15 chart, and “Tobey,” with Big Sean and BabyTron, which climbed to No. 27 on the July 20 chart.

	ENHYPEN captures its highest-charting album ever, and fourth top 10, as Romance: Untold debuts at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with 124,000 equivalent album units earned — the act’s largest week ever by units. Of that sum, album sales comprise 117,000 (the group’s best sales week ever; the set debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 7,000 (equaling 9.53 million on-demand official streams of the album’s tracks) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The album’s sales were bolstered by its availability across 17 different CD variants, all containing collectible paper ephemera like photocards, stickers and a poster, as well as two vinyl editions.

Zach Bryan’s The Great American Bar Scene slips 2-3 in its third week on the list (88,000 equivalent album units; down 36%) while Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department falls 1-4 (82,000; down 50%). The latter spent its first 12 weeks on the chart at No. 1.

	










Morgan Wallen’s chart-topping One Thing at a Time dips 3-5 on the Billboard 200 with 66,000 equivalent album units earned (down 5%), Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft descends 4-6 with 57,000 units (down 2%) and Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess falls 5-7 with 54,000 units (down less than 1%).

	Clairo scores her highest-charting album ever, and first top 10, as Charm enters at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 with 49,000 equivalent album units earned — her best week ever by units. Of that sum, album sales comprise 33,500 (her best sales week ever), SEA units comprise 15,500 (equaling 19.78 million on-demand streams of the set’s tracks) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The set’s first-week sales was amplified by the album’s availability across eight vinyl variants and four deluxe boxed sets (containing branded merchandise and a CD). Vinyl sales comprise 15,000 of the album’s first week – Clairo’s best week ever on vinyl.

	The album was preceded by the single “Sexy to Someone,” which has reached the top 20 of the Adult Alternative Airplay chart, and the top 30 of the Alternative Airplay and Hot Rock & Alternative Songs rankings.

	Megan Moroney lands her first top 10-charting set on the Billboard 200 as her second full-length studio album Am I Okay? bows at No. 9 with 43,000 equivalent album units earned — the singer-songwriter’s largest week by units. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 30,000 (equaling 38.05 million on-demand official streams of the set’s tracks), album sales comprise 13,000 and TEA units comprise less than 500. The album was preceded by a trio of entries on the Hot Country Songs chart: “No Caller ID,” “28th of June” and “Indifferent.” The new album’s success follows Moroney’s chart breakthrough in 2023 with the single “Tennessee Orange,” from her debut full-length, Lucky (peaking at No. 38 on the Billboard 200 in 2023). “Tennessee” climbed to No. 10 on Hot Country Songs and garnered song of the year nominations at both the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards.

	










	Closing out the top 10 of the new Billboard 200 is Noah Kahan’s Stick Season, slipping 7-10 with 40,000 equivalent album units earned (though up 4%).
