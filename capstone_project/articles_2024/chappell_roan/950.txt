ROGERS, Ark. (KAIT) - For Pink Pony girls and boys who planned to see Chappell Roan in Arkansas: “You’re out of luck, babe.”
Just two days after announcing she would perform on Oct. 2 in Rogers, the Walmart AMP announced Thursday that tickets had already sold out.
The tickets were scheduled to go on sale to the public on Friday, July 19. But a presale was held on Wednesday.
Jennifer Wilson, senior director of public relations for the Walmart AMP, said there would be no public sales on Friday.
