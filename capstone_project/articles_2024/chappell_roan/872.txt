Kith Announced a Giorgio Armani Collaboration

















Ronnie Fieg




Kith is collaborating with Giorgio Armani on a “suit project,” becoming the first brand to ever partner with the Italian menswear designer on a collection.
Creative director and founder Ronnie Fieg took to social media on Wednesday afternoon to announce the partnership, calling Mr. Armani his “North Star” collaborator.
“To say Mr. Armani is an icon would be an understatement,” Fieg wrote. “His perspective on fashion changed the way the world chose to dress. He founded his own brand and built it into an empire that he still retains 100% control of 49 years later. He set the impossibly high standard that I push myself to reach every day.”
Jeremy Allen White Scored Another Calvin Klein Campaign

















Mert Alas




After stripping on a New York City rooftop and subsequently breaking the internet for Calvin Klein’s Spring 2024 campaign in January, Jeremy Allen White has secured another starring role in the American fashion brand’s Fall 2024 advertisement — this time, sun-drenched and poolside.
Directed and shot by Mert Alas, the sartorial delivery sees The Bear actor posing in the brand’s classic denim and underwear silhouettes while lounging on patio chairs, posing against sweeping views and chilling by a bright blue pool with a squad of big dogs. The photographs arrive alongside a video in which White lounges on his roof deck, splashes himself with water and plays with the animals.
“Jeremy Allen White is a sun-drenched daydream. See every moment through a new lens,” Calvin Klein captioned the video on Instagram.
Yoon Ahn’s Nike Women Collection Celebrated Naomi Osaka’s Return

















Nike




When Naomi Osaka stepped back onto the U.S. Open’s tennis court on Tuesday afternoon, she wore a one-of-a-kind kit designed by Yoon Ahn for Nike. The Japanese tennis player’s custom uniforms — in green for day and black for night —  included performance dresses crafted for the exact specifications of her game, along with walk-on skirts and coats with billowing bows.
“The inspiration that fueled the look for me — and this might be a Japanese term — is feeling like a ‘magical girl’ on the court,” Osaka says. “There’s a moment of transformation for me when I walk onto the court, and I have a lot of fun playing, so wanting everyone who sees the outfit to connect with that feeling is a really big motivation for me.”
Osaka’s one-of-one uniforms arrive alongside an all-new Nike Women by Yoon ready-to-wear collection, which takes inspiration from vintage school uniforms and classic athletic styles.

Joopiter




Pharrell‘s JOOPITER auction house announced its next sale: “Nothing But A ‘G’ Thang: The Art & Archive of G-Dragon,” with K-pop icon G-Dragon.
The sale will include rare fashion items, contemporary art, design objects and fan memorabilia that G-Dragon has collected throughout his illustrious career.
G-Dragon said, “As an artist I have a deep desire to always evolve and learn from other legendary creators, which is how I developed an interest in art, design and collecting. Over many years, Pharrell and I have developed a special bond over our shared curiosity for finding inspiration anywhere. At this exciting stage in my life, I have been looking back in order to move forward. JOOPITER is the perfect partner to help tell my story, and reveal pieces that have inspired me along the way.”
GANNI To Make Its Paris Fashion Week Debut

















Ganni




GANNI will show its Spring/Summer 2025 collection during Paris Fashion Week later this month. The Danish brand, which formerly showed its collections during Copenhagen Fashion Week, will take to the French capital on Tuesday, September 24.
“Ganni has established itself globally, and as we enter our next chapter of growth, showcasing in Paris is a natural evolution for our brand equity and scale,” said CEO Laura du Rusquec, who took over control of the label in April.
She added, “Paris offers an unparalleled global platform, and we are excited to present our SS25 collection, along with our ongoing vision and commitment to responsibility in the fashion industry.”
The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Is Coming Back This October

After confirming that its infamous runway show would return in true form earlier this year, Victoria’s Secret has shared an all-new promotional video for the event, starring supermodels Gigi Hadid and Tyra Banks, who reveal the much-anticipated catwalk’s official date.
In the clip, Hadid enters a luxury New York City apartment building and approaches the front desk, passing by pink-tinged Christmas decorations along the front corridor. Upon a gold bell’s ring, Banks reveals herself at the counter in a one-two step with Chappell Roan’s ”Femininomenon.” Banks then hands Hadid the show’s official invite, which states that the event will take place in New York City on October 15, 2024.

Michelle Yeoh, Isabelle Huppert and More Starred in Balenciaga’s Bel Air Campaign

















Nadav Kander




After dropping off its big-stepping 3XL sneaker campaign last week, Balenciaga has returned with another promotional delivery spotlighting its newly-released Bel Air bag.
This time around, the Demna-led label recruited ambassadors Michelle Yeoh and Isabelle Huppert, as well as actress Naomi Watts, to pose with the hero accessory in a series of studio shots by Nadav Kander. Seated on simple chairs, each star creates a “character study” while wearing the brand’s moody ready-to-wear pieces: trompe-l’oeil pantashoes, dramatic evening gowns and sharp knife pumps. Notably, the concept builds on “The Characters Campaign” that Balenciaga released for its popular Rodeo bag last month, in which Watts and Huppert also starred alongside ambassador Kim Kardashian.

When Naomi Osaka stepped back onto the U.S. Open’s tennis court on Tuesday afternoon, she wore a one-of-a-kind kit designed by Yoon Ahn for Nike. The Japanese tennis player’s custom uniforms — in green for day and black for night —  included performance dresses crafted for the exact specifications of her game, along with walk-on skirts and coats with billowing bows.
“The inspiration that fueled the look for me — and this might be a Japanese term — is feeling like a ‘magical girl’ on the court,” Osaka says. “There’s a moment of transformation for me when I walk onto the court, and I have a lot of fun playing, so wanting everyone who sees the outfit to connect with that feeling is a really big motivation for me.”
Osaka’s one-of-one uniforms arrive alongside an all-new Nike Women by Yoon ready-to-wear collection, which takes inspiration from vintage school uniforms and classic athletic styles.

The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Is Coming Back This October

After confirming that its infamous runway show would return in true form earlier this year, Victoria’s Secret has shared an all-new promotional video for the event, starring supermodels Gigi Hadid and Tyra Banks, who reveal the much-anticipated catwalk’s official date.
In the clip, Hadid enters a luxury New York City apartment building and approaches the front desk, passing by pink-tinged Christmas decorations along the front corridor. Upon a gold bell’s ring, Banks reveals herself at the counter in a one-two step with Chappell Roan’s ”Femininomenon.” Banks then hands Hadid the show’s official invite, which states that the event will take place in New York City on October 15, 2024.

Michelle Yeoh, Isabelle Huppert and More Starred in Balenciaga’s Bel Air Campaign

















Nadav Kander




After dropping off its big-stepping 3XL sneaker campaign last week, Balenciaga has returned with another promotional delivery spotlighting its newly-released Bel Air bag.
This time around, the Demna-led label recruited ambassadors Michelle Yeoh and Isabelle Huppert, as well as actress Naomi Watts, to pose with the hero accessory in a series of studio shots by Nadav Kander. Seated on simple chairs, each star creates a “character study” while wearing the brand’s moody ready-to-wear pieces: trompe-l’oeil pantashoes, dramatic evening gowns and sharp knife pumps. Notably, the concept builds on “The Characters Campaign” that Balenciaga released for its popular Rodeo bag last month, in which Watts and Huppert also starred alongside ambassador Kim Kardashian.

The sale will include rare fashion items, contemporary art, design objects and fan memorabilia that G-Dragon has collected throughout his illustrious career.
G-Dragon said, “As an artist I have a deep desire to always evolve and learn from other legendary creators, which is how I developed an interest in art, design and collecting. Over many years, Pharrell and I have developed a special bond over our shared curiosity for finding inspiration anywhere. At this exciting stage in my life, I have been looking back in order to move forward. JOOPITER is the perfect partner to help tell my story, and reveal pieces that have inspired me along the way.”

GANNI will show its Spring/Summer 2025 collection during Paris Fashion Week later this month. The Danish brand, which formerly showed its collections during Copenhagen Fashion Week, will take to the French capital on Tuesday, September 24.
“Ganni has established itself globally, and as we enter our next chapter of growth, showcasing in Paris is a natural evolution for our brand equity and scale,” said CEO Laura du Rusquec, who took over control of the label in April.
She added, “Paris offers an unparalleled global platform, and we are excited to present our SS25 collection, along with our ongoing vision and commitment to responsibility in the fashion industry.”
The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Is Coming Back This October

After confirming that its infamous runway show would return in true form earlier this year, Victoria’s Secret has shared an all-new promotional video for the event, starring supermodels Gigi Hadid and Tyra Banks, who reveal the much-anticipated catwalk’s official date.
In the clip, Hadid enters a luxury New York City apartment building and approaches the front desk, passing by pink-tinged Christmas decorations along the front corridor. Upon a gold bell’s ring, Banks reveals herself at the counter in a one-two step with Chappell Roan’s ”Femininomenon.” Banks then hands Hadid the show’s official invite, which states that the event will take place in New York City on October 15, 2024.

Michelle Yeoh, Isabelle Huppert and More Starred in Balenciaga’s Bel Air Campaign

















Nadav Kander




After dropping off its big-stepping 3XL sneaker campaign last week, Balenciaga has returned with another promotional delivery spotlighting its newly-released Bel Air bag.
This time around, the Demna-led label recruited ambassadors Michelle Yeoh and Isabelle Huppert, as well as actress Naomi Watts, to pose with the hero accessory in a series of studio shots by Nadav Kander. Seated on simple chairs, each star creates a “character study” while wearing the brand’s moody ready-to-wear pieces: trompe-l’oeil pantashoes, dramatic evening gowns and sharp knife pumps. Notably, the concept builds on “The Characters Campaign” that Balenciaga released for its popular Rodeo bag last month, in which Watts and Huppert also starred alongside ambassador Kim Kardashian.
