July brought a sea of pink to E Pike to see Chappell Roan as Capitol Hill Block Party nearly ripped apart at the seams with a record crowd
Here is a look back at the year that was across Capitol Hill and Seattle. It is a look back at massive investments like the opening of the more than $140 million RapidRide G transit and street overhaul to Madison. It is a look back at challenges and sadness like the killings of Ruth Dalton, Paul Ewell, and Kenji Spurgeon. It is, hopefully, a look forward to doing more to solve the intersections of community, safety, and security that took a young life Amarr Murphy-Paine from us much too soon. In the coming year, there will be stories of justice and CHS will tell those. We also hope to tell stories of sorting out these challenges and making new great things. CHS wishes you a happy 2025 — here are the things that happened in 2024 that will help build the year ahead.
