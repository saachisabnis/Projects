Chappell Roan is, by far, the most buzzed-about act performing at this year’s Outside Lands music festival in San Francisco.
And one lucky attendee (maybe more?) will have the chance to meet the pop star while she is town to perform on Sunday at the festival in Golden Gate Park.
To try and win the chance to meet Roan, festival-goers are instructed to text “OSL” (which stands for Outside Lands) to 99126.
There is also a QR code, shown in the photo below, which fans can scan to enter.
When you scan that code, it takes you to a page where you can enter to win a bunch of different Outside Lands-related prizes.
Prizes include being able to watch Sabrina Carpenter’s set (on Saturday) from the front of the house — as well as similar viewing spots for Sturgill Simpson and Post Malone sets (both on Sunday) — and VIP Outside Lands passes for 2025.
