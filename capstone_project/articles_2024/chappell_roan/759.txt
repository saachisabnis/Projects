“It’s my OPINION!!!!!” the “Pink Pony Club” singer says
Chappell Roan had some truly wild looks over the course of 2024, so it’s no surprise even she needed to take a moment, reflect, and rank them. “Why yes, i do consider myself to be iconique,” she quipped in her Instagram post with her personal rankings.
But, “It’s my OPINION!!!!!” the “Pink Pony Club” singer added.

Chappell Roan has had a meteoric rise this summer. Along with being named as  Billboard’s Top Artist of 2024, her daytime crowds at festivals broke records (nearly 80,000 turned out for her set at Lollapalooza). Following her performance as Lady Liberty at Gov Ball in New York City, she broke down in front of fans at her show in Raleigh, North Carolina. She admitted that her “career is just kind of going really fast and it’s really hard to keep up.”
The singer has been open about her mental health struggles in the past. Roan previously opened up about her journey with bipolar II disorder in a TikTok video in May 2023. And she’s been frank and honest about her need to set boundaries as her growing fame caused her to experience “too many nonconsensual” encounters with fans.
Fortunately, the fans have backed her wholeheartedly. Check out how her performance at this year’s Austin City Limits played out:
