In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Miley Cyrus disclosed that she is working on a new visual album called Something Beautiful that is inspired by Pink Floyd’s The Wall. Cyrus first saw The Wall as a teenager with her brother, where they smoked weed in a limousine while decked out in 70s-style clothes. “We really leaned in,” Cyrus admits. “And so I have this heart-first attachment to it. My idea was making The Wall, but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous and filled with pop culture.” She says her new record has a “hypnotizing and glamorous” vibe, describing it as “a concept album that’s an attempt to medicate somewhat of a sick culture through music.” 
Cyrus also showed support for Chappell Roan as she navigates pop stardom as a young musician, something Miley knows all about. “I wish people would not give her a hard time,” Cyrus said. “It’s probably really hard coming into this business with phones and Instagram. That wasn’t always a part of my life, and I’m not a part of it now.” (NME)
