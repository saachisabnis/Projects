On Monday (October 28), Chappell Roan achieved her very first RIAA certified Platinum-selling single with her Billboard Top 5 hit, “Good Luck, Babe!” Roan’s fan favorite song has now hit the 1,000,000 copies sold threshold, becoming the best-selling song of the pop superstar’s flourishing career. The track officially hit Gold status (500,000 copies sold) back on May 29, but following her triumphant performance at Lollapalooza – where she had the largest daytime crowd in the festival’s history – as well as her high-profile medieval performance of the tune at the MTV VMA’s in September – where it was nominated for Song of the Summer – “Good Luck, Babe!”  is clearly resonating with Roan’s fans as her audience continues to grow. In addition to the platinum recognition of Roan’s breakout single, her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, was also just certified Gold by the RIAA. (Uproxx)
