Dancing with the Stars
September 12, 2024

In less than a week from now, you are going to have a chance to see the Dancing with the Stars 33 premiere — want to know the songs?
Today, ABC confirmed both the music and styles for everyone who is going to be taking part in the premiere — and it honestly feels like a pretty perfect collection. After all, a lot of these songs are expressions of either who they are, or the story that they’ve had in the public eye.
To get some more info, just check out the spoilers below…
We’ve said this before but for now, it feels like Stephen and Chandler are probably the two favorites when it comes to dance ability. They each have the resume of people who tend to do well on the show.
Meanwhile, Anna is easily the most polarizing person on the season right now … not that this is a surprise.
Be sure to share right now in the attached comments! Once you do just that, remember to keep coming back for some other updates.
