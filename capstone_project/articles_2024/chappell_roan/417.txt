All the tears for this Pink Pony Girl!
According to The Pink News, Chappell Roan opened up about how Kesha made her cry at Lollapalooza!
Chappell had said the size of the crowd had completely stressed her out and Kesha came to talk with some words of comfort!  Chappell said, "Because with that huge of a crowd, maybe only five other people there understood what that’s like. Kesha came to talk to me after, and it felt like a big sister was helping me through it. Me and Reneé (Rapp) were crying because we felt like we were seen in a way we never had been before."
