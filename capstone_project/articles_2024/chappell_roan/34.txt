Spotify has released its 2024 Global Songs of Summer list, and “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” by Shaboozey is one of the five tracks on this year’s list of the various sounds and moments that defined summer 2024 for listeners.
“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” soundtracked summer for fans listening across the globe, hitting No. 1 on Spotify Charts in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Ireland, Norway and Sweden since June. It has been in the top spot on Billboard for six weeks so far, and reached No. 1 on Spotify’s U.S. Chart for the first time on July 4, proving it to be the perfect summer holiday anthem.
“The global success of Shaboozey really exemplifies a shift in the sound reaching new audiences globally,” says Spotify’s Emma Vikström, Editorial Lead, Nordics. “It’s been incredible to see the growth of country music outside of the U.S. over the last few years.”
Spotify’s 2024 Songs of the Summer also include “Birds Of A Feather” by Billie Eilish, “Hot To Go!” by Chappell Roan, “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar and “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter.
