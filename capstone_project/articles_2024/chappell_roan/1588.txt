New York dance-rock icons LCD Soundsystem have released a new single entitled ‘x-ray eyes’, their first proper release in seven years.
The group’s last studio album, ‘american dream’, dropped in 2017, while their ‘Electric Lady Sessions’ live LP arrived in 2019. Since then, they’ve been gigging regularly - including euphoric performances at this year’s Glastonbury and All Points East - but haven’t shared any new music (besides ‘new body rhumba’, a standalone track made for the 2022 film White Noise) until now.

For the initiated, their two hour stretch is near faultless.
‘x-ray eyes’ was first premiered on NTS Radio on 22nd October, but hasn’t been available to listen to on other streaming services until last night (31st October), when James Murphy and co. shared the news by simply posting an Instagram Story reading “X-ray eyes is a new single by LCD Soundsystem and is out tonight”. 
What’s more, it’s also been confirmed that we can expect a new LCD album in the near(ish) future too. Writing in a statement posted to Instagram, Murphy commented: “so there’s a new lcd song now called x ray eyes. it’s the first single of what’s shaping up to be a new album. don’t ask me when that is, because we’re still working on it. […] there’s no finished LP yet. but when we’re not playing shows, it’s getting closer and closer to completion. so that’s the news. anything else you hear is bullshit speculation. go vote.”
Apparently, this is happening! Watch this space for more details on LCD’s next move, and listen to ‘x-ray eyes’ below.
