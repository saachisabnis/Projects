	Over the last few months, Chappell Roan has gone from being a slow-rising pop up-and-comer to becoming one of the most talked-about names in music. As great as that may be, even Roan is feeling a little overwhelmed with her new level of fame.

	During her Midwest Princess Tour stop in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday (June 12), Roan had a candid moment with the crowd. In a fan-captured video, the singer is stopping herself from crying on stage as the crowd cheered her name, before taking a moment to explain to them what was going on with her. 

	










	“I just want to be honest with the crowd: I just feel a little off today,” she said between breaths. “I think my career is just kind of going really fast and it’s really hard to keep up. I’m just being honest … I’m having a hard time today.”

	The singer assured her fans that she’s thrilled with the level of success she’s managed to achieve recently, but that she needs to adjust to the change. “I’m sorry … I’m not trying to give you, like, a lesser show, it’s just that there’s a lot going on,” she said. “Thank you for understanding. This is all I’ve ever wanted — it’s just heavy sometimes.” 

	With the release of her breakout single “Good Luck, Babe!,” Roan’s fan base and public profile have risen dramatically. The star’s 2023 album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, recently re-entered the Billboard 200, climbing to a new high of No. 12 (on this week’s chart dated June 15). Meanwhile three of her songs are currently charting on the Billboard Hot 100: “Good Luck” at No. 26, “Red Wine Supernova” at No. 75 and “Hot to Go!” at No. 80.
