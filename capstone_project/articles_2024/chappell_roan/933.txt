OneRepublic is no stranger to the world’s pop charts, with seven Top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 — including “Counting Stars,” “Apologize,” “Good Life” and “Love Runs Out” — during the past 17 years.
But co-founder and multi-instrumentalist Brent Kutzle maintains the Colorado-formed sextet is “more of a rock-leaning band at the core.
“We grew up listening to U2, Radiohead, the Beatles — all of the usual suspects,” explains Kutzle, 39, who, outside of OneRepublic, has worked with artists such as Beyonce, Matchbox Twenty, Kelly Clarkson and others. “I think for us, anything with a rock edge is more our speed. The songs take shape differently on tour than the record. When you see us on stage, it’s more rock, it’s more live.”
Kutzle adds, too, that, “it’s a very eclectic show — that’s just who we are as a band. We’re all into different things. I grew up playing cello, so I’m a classical guy at the core. Our singer (Ryan Tedder) grew up singing R&B. Rock is the ultimate anchor for us, but we’re all pretty different in our approach.”
“Artificial Paradise,” OneRepublic’s sixth and latest studio album, came out in July, while the group released a new version of the track “Hurt” with Jelly Roll added to the mix. Kutzle co-wrote eight of the album’s 15 tracks and co-produced 10, and he’s comfortable with the diversity that’s become stock in trade for the band’s recorded work.
“We have to experiment with the music,” he acknowledges. “We have to try everything and anything, all the time. I think that keeps it fresh, too. We don’t place rules on ourselves as far as songwriting goes or how the songs should sound.
“There’s so many bands that say: ‘We’re this. We’re a three-piece. We always have a lead guitar solo. We always have a bass line that sounds like this.’ That’s never who we’ve been. We just let the chips fall how they will. That’s just fun.”
OneRepublic headlines the 96.3 WDVD Blaine and Lauren’s Not So Silent Night at the Fillmore Detroit, 2115 Woodward Ave., on Sunday, Dec. 8. Doors at 6:30 p.m. Judah & the Lion and the Blaine Fowler Experience open. 313-961-5451 or thefillmoredetroit.com.
