Chappell Roan is clearing the air after sharing her political stance — which proved rather polarizing.
In an interview with The Guardian published Friday, September 20, Roan explained why she hasn't endorsed U.S. presidential candidate and Democrat contender Kamala Harris.
"I have so many issues with our government in every way," said the "Good Luck, Babe!" hitmaker. "There are so many things that I would want to change. So I don't feel pressured to endorse someone. There's problems on both sides. I encourage people to use your critical thinking skills, use your vote – vote small, vote for what's going on in your city."
Since the interview was published, many fans took to social media to express their disappointment, suggesting that a non-endorsement for Harris implies an endorsement for Donald Trump.
Roan took to TikTok on Tuesday, September 24 to set the record straight. She clarified that she, in no way, was endorsing Trump, but still wants voters to hold their representatives accountable.
"I have encouraged people to use critical thinking skills to learn about what they're voting for, learn about who they're voting for, and ask questions," Roan said, "and it's being completely taken out of context, per usual."
Roan continued, urging fans and followers to do their own research.
"it's important for me to question authority, and question world leaders, and question myself. Question my algorithm," she continued. "Question if some person that tweeted something about something else is even true. It's important to question, because that's how I think we move forward."
Elsewhere in the video, Roan expressed that she does plan to vote. Once again, she did not share who she's voting for, but encouraged fans to think for themselves, as she wants to be part of a generation that sparks change.
"This is my third election voting and the world is changing so rapidly, and I want to be part of the generation that changes things for good, because we need it," Roan said. "Actions speak louder than words, and actions speak louder than an endorsement."
On Thursday, September 25, Roan shared a follow-up video, explaining that "Endorsing and voting are completely different," and that she is still unable to endorse a candidate.
"Obviously, f**k the policies of the right, but also f**k some of the policies on the left," said Roan.
Im done talking about it. If you dont get what im saying from this, its a lost cause. And im not forcing you to agree with me. This is my statement. Have a good day
She continued, saying, "There is no way I can stand behind some of the left's transphobic and completely genocidal views."
Though Roan is continuing to face backlash, she doubled down, saying she will not be pressured into voting in a way she truly can't get behind.
"I'm not gonna settle for what the options that are in front of me," said Roan. "And you're not gonna make me feel bad for that."
Once again, she clarified that her vote does not indicate an endorsement. But she did finally let fans know who she is voting for.
"I'm voting for f**king Kamala," she said.
