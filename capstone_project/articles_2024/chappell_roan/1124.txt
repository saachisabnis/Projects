WOUB Culture’s Suggested Listening series highlights the music that resonated with WOUB Culture contributors and regional artists in 2024. Today we spotlight Brandon Thompson. a.k.a DJ B-Funk. 
Born in Athens, OH, DJ B-Funk appreciates the Appalachian sounds he was surrounded by growing up with while advocating for broader acceptance of the 808s and electronic kick drum sounds responsible for energizing dance floors around the world for decades. He loves House, Trance, Disco — anything with energy. Movie scores and soundtracks are his favorite genre.
You can catch B-Funk djing the Trust Me Dance Party at Casa Nueva, the Athens Halloween Block Party, or at Good Night John Boy in Columbus (906 North High Street)  
You can join him at Side Bar on NYE this year with his friends Muchi Nochi and Barticus! 
One Night/All Night (live) — Justice, Tame Impala
1 of 10
Electronic
This is my number one song of 2024! The rest are in no particular order. This year, my love for Justice went into overdrive. The first single from their new album TRULY connected with me. Great songs take you to places you’ve never been—this one, with funky vocals by Tame Vocal just below the surface, feels like a never-ending party I’ll do anything to reach. Enjoy this live Coachella clip showing why Justice is the artist to see live. The wall of bass needs to be felt. Holy lights overload, Batman!
Make You Happy — Luttrell
2 of 10
House
I discovered this song at Anjuna Deep Red Rocks last October and waited 8 months (checking Reddit daily) for this bubbly pop gem to officially drop. The melody—a rework of Clocks by Coldplay (my all-time favorite)—and the line, “I want to make you happy, I want to set you free,” dance in your head until BOOM, 2:30 in, an unexpected bassline flattens you. This song works just as well in the Kroger cereal aisle as it does moving 5,000 house heads at Red Rocks. That’s the magic.
Teaser Music From Avatar 2: The Way of Water — Solstice Beats
3 of 10
Soundtrack
Avatar 2 was okay, but it’s disappointing how lacking it is in people of color. It’s the future—why is almost everyone blue and white?  Oh well. That said, the song used in the teaser trailer is BEYOND magic. Hearing it before a film in IMAX, I felt intense calmness and beauty, instantly transported to Pandora and underwater. Music themes are ultimate time travel, taking you to impossible places without moving. I sent this song to a coworker going through a tough time, reminding her that music this beautiful gives me hope things will work out.
A Time of Quiet Between the Storms – Hans Zimmer
4 of 10
Soundtrack
The first Hans Zimmer song on this list is why I bought a record player—to get the expanded Dune 2 vinyl. I saw the film three times—twice in Dolby Atmos, once in IMAX—and this theme SLAPS. The build, the release, the feeling of Arrakis engulfing you as Paul and Chani embrace—it’s pure magic. Sadly, some will feel nothing while hearing this theme. The beauty we seek is all around us if we just stop and let it in. Buy this album.
Namba – Yotto
5 of 10
Progressive House
Yotto returns to my top 10 list AGAIN! This was the first song I played at Athens Halloween this year and it’s HEAVY. A Hip Hop vocal and a disco diva vocal mix to make a floor mover. But it’s truly the unrelenting bass line that gives the banger wings. Can Yotto miss? Of course he can, but when he lands HOLY S**T watch out!
Starwave — Estiva
6 of 10
Progressive House
Have you ever closed your eyes and thought you were travelling through space while listening to trance? No? Oh! that’s just me! Ha ha, well,  I mean, no, that’s not what I meant. I meant to  say…oh hell, yes, that’s what happens to me. GUILTY.  Well, it’s an involuntary response. This music always reminds me of piloting a nondescript mech through the stars and I love it. The melody represents the stars dancing around me as we move toward whatever adventure we seek. Give it a try!
She’s Gone, Dance On— Disclosure

7 of 10
House
Disclosure is one of the greatest dance acts of my generation. This one snuck up on me—I almost skipped their set at ARC music festival after being underwhelmed at Movement. But friends convinced me, and this song GOES OFF LIVE! It’s like a 2000s dance classic with a carefree “just keep dancing” vibe. I played it at Athens Halloween to GREAT applause!
Wonder Woman Suite: Part 3- Live— Hans Zimmer

8 of 10
Soundtrack/Theme
Wonder Woman’s theme (one of the best superhero themes) puts the electric guitar front and center to start, and then  this song just GOES FOR IT. Recorded live, Zimmer and the Disruptive Collective bring incredible energy. At 2:51, when you think it’s either over or can’t get better, it shifts to a Wonder Woman 1984 theme, continually reaching for the stars. Then the choir joins for the final 30 seconds, and I suddenly know what song I’d pick to inspire anyone facing an impossible task.
X-Men ‘97 Soundtrack— Newton Brothers

9 of 10
Soundtrack
This clip shows the power of music. X-Men ’97 shouldn’t have worked, but the MUSIC—my gosh! This scene lives in my head forever. Storm’s regal presence, as an omega-level threat mutant, shines as her theme (“Give them the forecast”) kicks in. Her feet turn sand to glass, the sentinels take notice, and it ends with a triumphant rework of the iconic X-Men: The Animated Series theme. GET IT VINYL ON AT ROAR RECORDS LIKE I DID!
Pink Pony Club –  Chappell Roan
10 of 10
Pop
A song belongs on your top 10 list if you find yourself singing it, whether by force or choice. This song is infinitely belt-able and so easy to connect with—a girl singing about wanting to feel accepted. We all feel that, but this one captures it perfectly. You might even tear up while singing, and that’s how you know it’s a BANGER. An immortal song for sure, even my daughter, Parker, agrees. Though, she prefers Hot To Go more. That one’s great, but Pink Pony Club has the emotion!
