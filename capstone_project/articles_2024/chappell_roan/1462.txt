Literally. Iconic.
It's the weekend before Halloween, which means that things are getting seriously spooky around here.
Yep, if you've been on a high street anywhere across the UK, you'll have noticed any number of Halloween outfits, including sexy witches, blood-soaked vampires and bearded werewolves, out and about. Everywhere you look, there's fake cobwebs, plastic skeletons and ghoulish decorations. 
With the 31st October falling on a Thursday, plenty of people are getting into the spirit early and marking the occasion ‚Äî whether it's with spook-tastic parties or pumpkin carving ‚Äî this weekend. 
And the Halloween vibes aren't just for us regular folks, even our fave celebs are getting in on the act. 
This includes none other than Anne Hathaway: aka our fave actress and the romcom star who has just announced she will be appearing in a third iteration of the iconic Princess Diaries film series. 
As well as delivering ah-mazing movie news, Anne is nailing Halloween. Posting a series of pics to Instagram, she unveiled a seriously iconic makeover. 
Rocking a t-shirt with the slogan "Boo York City" (a spooky play on "New York City", we presume) and a black leather motorcycle jacket, she can be seen wearing a white bobbed wig, dark purple lipstick, and white and grey face paint. Atop her head, she rocked a green crown ‚Äî a clear reference to the State of Liberty. 
Either Anne is going for a ghostly State of Liberty OR a zombie version of Chappell Roan, dressed as the Statue of Liberty to perform at the Governors Ball. 
Either way, we're obsessed!
