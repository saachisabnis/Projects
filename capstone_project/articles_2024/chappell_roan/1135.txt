The Kamala Harris and Tim Walz presidential campaign is underway. As the respective Presidential candidate and Vice Presidential candidate are garnering much support and are already pulling in merch sales, pop music fans — young and old — may have noticed some similarities in some of the Harris-Walz merchandise to that of a rising pop star.
One of Harris-Walz's fashionable campaign accessories is a camouflage trucker cap with orange lettering reading "Harris Walz." Upon the reveal of the cap, fans of Chappell Roan noticed that this was similar to one of the "Red Wine Supernova" hitmaker's merch items promoting her The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess album. Roan's cap also contains a camouflage pattern, but hers reads "Midwest Princess" in the same shade of orange lettering.
A fan of Roan, 26, brought this to her attention on X (formerly Twitter), to which Roan — who hails from Willard, Missouri — simply responded, "is this real?"

While this could likely be a coincidence, it's no surprise that Roan's influence has reached Harris, 59, and Walz, 60. After all, a Google search for "Chappell Roan" will result in a link reading "Did you mean: your favorite artist's favorite artist."
But don't expect to get your hands on this hat anytime soon. According to a report from Washington Post, the trucker cap sold out within half an hour.
In regard to other remarkable feats, Roan recently drew in an astonishing crowd at Lollapalooza last Thursday, August 1. While an exact number of people in the audience is yet to be confirmed, it was reported that it may have been the largest audience for a daytime show in the festival's history.
Meanwhile, Harris and Walz are hard at work on campaigning. This week, the two are reported to be hitting the trail in Wisconsin and Michigan.
