Chappell Roan is continuing her campaign for red carpet etiquette, confronting another photographer in a heated exchange.

	While attending the Friday world premiere of Netflix‘s Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour concert documentary, the artist zeroed in on one shutterbug and pointed her finger before walking over to give them a piece of her mind in a video shared to social media.

	“You were so disrespectful to me at the Grammys. You yelled at me at the Grammy party. I remember, you were so rude to me. And I deserve an apology for that,” said Roan in the clip. “You need to apologize to me.”

	










	The photographer could be heard apologizing as Roan’s publicist pulled her away.

	Last month, before winning Best New Artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, Roan scolded a photographer on the red carpet who could be heard shouting “shut the f— up.” She turned while someone was styling her dress and yelled, “No, you shut the f— up! Not me, bitch.”

	Roan previously opened up on social media about her need to “draw lines and set boundaries” after encountering “predatory behavior disguised as ‘superfan’ behavior” from some of her “creepy” followers.

	“I’ve been in too many nonconsensual physical and social interactions, and I just need to lay it out and remind you, women don’t owe you s—,” she explained on Instagram. “I chose this career path because I love music and art and honoring my inner child. I do not accept harassment of any kind because I chose this path, nor do I deserve it.”

	Last month, Roan cancelled her All Things Go Music Festival performance after an “overwhelming” few weeks, explaining she needed “a few days to prioritize my health.”
