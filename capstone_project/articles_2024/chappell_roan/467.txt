Following the breakout success of Chappell Roan’s gold-certified debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, the pop superstar teased on Instagram on Tuesday (October 29) that she might have a new project in the works. In the post, Roan is shown holding up a copy of her record, along with the Love Island-referencing caption, “Album kinda popped off imo but it is time to welcome a hot new bombshell into the villa.” That hint, along with the recent New York Times profile on Roan’s producer Dan Nigro, suggests that Chappell might be close to sharing some new music with her growing fanbase. Nigro revealed that they have completed five new tracks together, including a “fun, up-tempo country song” featuring a fiddle, a “couple of ballads and a mid-tempo rock song.” Another new song, “The Subway,” has been featured in Roan’s recent live sets and is also expected to be included on her upcoming album.
