Chappell Roan's "Saturday Night Live" performances were epic — she even debuted a new song — but the night was almost ruined by a wardrobe malfunction just before hitting the stage. 
In a new interview with Nardwuar, Roan recalled ripping her long floor-length gown right down the back and having to be sewn in so she could carry on with her performance of "Pink Pony Club." Chappell told Nardwuar, "It ripped all the way down the back right before I walked on stage." Showing how big the rip was, she added, "I had to have SNL‘s in-house seamstress ... I was sewn into the dress because it ripped all the way down."
Nardwuar followed up the wardrobe malfunction story by questioning how to clean a used dress like that, to which Chappell replied, "They smell crazy, yeah." She added, "I don't know if I will clean it, I think I will just put it in a bag and put it back on the rack."
Have we seen the last of this dress or any other outfit Chappell has worn? The signer/songwriter said of outfit repeating, "I would love to, but my stylist is like, we have to keep it moving."
In addition to performing "Pink Pony Club" on the John Mulaney-hosted SNL episode, Roan also debuted a new country song called "The Giver," which is expected to appear on her second full-length album.
