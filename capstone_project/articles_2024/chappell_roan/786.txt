Chicago’s Grant Park has likely never seen as much pink as it did on Aug. 1.
That’s because Chappell Roan, self-proclaimed "Midwest princess" and rising pop phenom, requested on social media that her fans wear pink — or bring something of the color — to her set so she could spot them while on stage. Truth is, one would’ve had an easier time trying to find someone who wasn’t wearing pink.
“I think every person I’ve helped today has bought merch of hers,” said a worker at the artist merch tent. The tent was equipped for demand, stocked with pink bandanas from the “Pink Pony Club” singer’s merch line.
Roan’s 5 p.m. performance on the first day of this year’s Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago was something for the history books. Not only did Roan’s crowd surpass the numbers for all the nightly headliners, but a spokesperson for the festival told CNN that the crowd likely surpassed any crowd during the festival’s tenure in the city. 
“Chappell’s performance was the biggest daytime set we’ve ever seen,” said the spokesperson.
What’s bigger than the numbers, though, is what they mean. Roan is an outspoken lesbian artist performing at a mainstream music festival. She sings about kissing at slumber parties, trying new things (sexually or not), maybe going to hell (but probably being fine), and places “where boys and girls can all be queens.” 
Roan’s music has catapulted into the mainstream since she supported Olivia Rodrigo on her Guts World Tour earlier this year. To put it into perspective, Roan’s monthly listeners on Spotify hit one million just less than a year ago, in September 2023. At the time of publication, her monthly listens are nearing 40 million. And it won’t be surprising if we continue to see those numbers rise following this festival circuit.
She narrates her personal experiences in a way that still resonates with a wide breadth of people. That alleged record-breaking Lollapalooza crowd consisted of more than just queer people, but people of differing identities and walks of life from wide-ranging locations. Many people traveled to Chicago from out of state — and even out of the country — to see Roan, because it was cheaper to pay for transportation and buy a ticket to the festival than her individual shows, due to high scalper prices.
Leading up to the festival, Lollapalooza organizers swapped Roan’s stage assignment with pop singer Kesha to allow for the anticipated large crowd. But the impact on the festival — the "femininomenon," if you will — is something that likely wasn’t fully anticipated.

Roan's own small-town queer experience will resonate with anyone who grew up without the kind of visibility that makes it easier to be who you are.

“It was a magical moment added to Lolla’s DNA,” a festival spokesperson told CNN.
Now an annual Chicago-based festival, Lollapalooza originally started as a touring event in 1991, the brainchild of singer Perry Farrell of Jane’s Addiction as part of the band’s farewell tour. In its early years, Lollapalooza was considered an alt-rock showcase, with headliners like Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins and Rage Against the Machine. Now, it leans into being a multi-genre festival with a varied lineup, local artists and a vendor fair featuring food booths, social and political campaigns and nonprofit organizations.
Lollapalooza has a history of highlighting diverse artists and promoting conversation around acceptance and love. Their website states, “We dream of an America where ‘we the people’ means all of us and all people can thrive. A future beyond poverty, pollution, prisons and polarization. A future with freedom, dignity and opportunity for all.” 
Organizers try to adhere to that mission carefully considering which artists to invite and the overall aura of each fest. In fact, in 2021, the festival pulled DaBaby from its lineup after he went on a homophobic rant at Rolling Loud festival in Miami the week before he was set to perform.
On stage, DaBaby said, "If you didn't show up today with HIV, AIDS or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that'll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cellphone lighter up.” 
He continued the rant by adding, "Fellas, if you ain't sucking dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lighter up."

A statement on the festival’s social media said, “Lollapalooza was founded on diversity, inclusivity, respect, and love. With that in mind, DaBaby will no longer be performing at Grant Park tonight.” 
In addition to Roan, this year’s festival showcased other outspoken queer artists, including Renee Rapp, Megan Thee Stallion, The Japanese House, Ethel Cain, Victoria Monet and Kevin Abstract. Fans anxiously awaited each set, many with DIY shirts, Pride flags and “I Heart Pretty Girls” hats in tow.
“It feels very loving and accepting here,” said concertgoer Jason Sekili. “And it definitely doesn’t feel like that everywhere.”
Elena Garcia, another concertgoer, agreed: “In a time where the political climate is so charged, having celebrations of love, even when they aren’t supported by everyone, having a place [where you can] tell there is love and acceptance is incredible,” she said.
After her set, Roan shared on her socials that she was crying as she walked on stage due to “the overwhelm of support.” She then said she “will remember this moment forever.” It’s safe to say attendees will, too.
