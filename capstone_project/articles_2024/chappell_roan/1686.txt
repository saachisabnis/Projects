A 60-year-old tradition, the Grammy Awards allow music lovers to celebrate their favorite artists and songs. The Recording Academy receives around 20,000 artistic entries through the application process. While the competition is always fierce, this year’s music scene is unlike any other. Artists have redefined genres of country, pop and electronic music, and albums have sparked social movements. 
The discourse around which album will win Album of the Year has already begun, and although the official Grammy nominations won’t be announced until Nov. 8, there are some obvious top contenders. As a music enthusiast, I have some hunches about which albums have a stronger chance of winning. Here’s what you need to know about the top contenders, in order from what I believe has the least chance of winning to the most. 
“Cowboy Carter” by Beyoncé
Released on Mar. 29, “Cowboy Carter’ is Beyoncé’s eighth studio album. Her first seven albums have consistently showcased her versatility across genres like pop, R&B, hip-hop, soul and rock. A genre she had yet to conquer — until now — is country, a traditionally white-dominated field. As a Black woman, entering the country music arena is a political statement in itself. 
In “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé asserts her place in country music, weaving in anecdotes from her childhood, experiences with racism and references to art and cultural narratives. The album’s chances of winning Album of the Year based on the basis of creativity, boundary-pushing and talent are strong. However, due to its popularity among the masses, I believe it doesn’t have a significant advantage over its competitors — although Kanye West may beg to differ.
“Short n’ Sweet” by Sabrina Carpenter 
“I leave quite an impression / Five feet to be exact,” pop singer Sabrina Carpenter quips in her song, “Taste” from her new album “Short n’ Sweet,” released Aug. 23. Carpenter has solidified her legacy of producing irresistible pop hits. With a ‘90s pop star image adored by fans, “Short n’ Sweet” arrived at the height of her internet fame. Fans have dubbed it a “no-skip album,” filled with love songs, hate songs, catchy melodies and charismatic lyrics. While the songs are enjoyable, they don’t break new ground in the genre. For this reason, I don’t expect it to win Album of the Year, but given the public’s love for Carpenter and the album’s cultural impact, a Grammy win wouldn’t be surprising.
“The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” by Chappell Roan 
On Sept. 22, 2023, Chappell Roan challenged the music industry with her debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.” The album reimagines pop with fun ballads, relatable lyrics and carefree messages. Roan tackles themes like heartbreak, lesbain relationships and women’s unfair roles in the household. Although her talent is undeniable, Roan’s overnight success followed 10 overlooked years in the industry. She gained recognition as an opener for Olivia Rodrigo’s “GUTS” World Tour and skyrocketed to fame after her Coachella performance in April 2024. Her dynamic performances — featuring elaborate costumes and high-energy dances — have drawn comparisons to original pop icons. The album spread like wildfire on social media, boosting its popularity (and increasing its chances of winning). 
“The Tortured Poets Department” by Taylor Swift
Last released but far from least, “The Tortured Poets Department,” released April 19, is Taylor Swift’s 11th studio album (not including her four re-released albums). However, this may be her most controversial album yet. After 18 years of writing and producing, Swift has become a household name, and with that fame came immense pressure. The 31 tracks made some listeners question whether prioritizing quantity over quality is the right choice. Others criticized the lyrics, calling them random or even offensive. Nonetheless, her fanbase prevailed, and her songs took over billboards for weeks. Given her history with the Grammys — 52 nominations and 14 wins — I wouldn’t be surprised if TTPD takes home Album of the Year. However, based on lyricism and overall talent compared to her peers, I don’t believe this album deserves the award.
“Hit Me Hard and Soft” by Billie Eilish
Released May 17, “Hit Me Hard and Soft” is Billie Eilish’s third studio album. With the help of her brother FINNEAS, the two produced a remarkable and uniquely crafted piece of art. Per the Billie Eilish website, the album is meant to hit you “hard and soft” with its lyrics and musicality. It delves into topics ranging from Eilish’s body image struggles, magnified by the media, to her recent breakup. Eilish captures emotions you didn’t know you had with beats that make you move and a voice that breaks your heart — then heals it. At just 22 years old, Eilish has a unique ability to resonate with her target audience. This album dominated the charts and social media for months following its release. The songs are relatable, leading teenagers worldwide to post relatable TikTok after TikTok, globalizing her music even further. With her talent and widespread appeal, I believe this album has a strong shot at winning Album of the Year.
“BRAT” by Charli XCX
Now for the album that truly swept the nation this summer, “BRAT.” Released on June 7, the album dominated the past three months and owned the color lime green. The album is genre-bending, mixing hyper-electronic pop with traditional pop and club music. Every track is upbeat, playing with sound, reverb and feeling. Outside of the unique music talent, “BRAT” became a cultural movement. “BRAT summer” became viral on TikTok, with the songs everywhere, even appearing in Vice President Kamala Harris’ election campaign ads. In my opinion, this album is the most likely to win, thanks to its pure talent and cultural impact. 
There’s no denying that each of these albums is a strong contender for Album of the Year. They break musical norms, redefine genres and resonate with millions. Music is deeply personal, which is why award shows like the Grammys are so beloved. Be sure to tune into the Grammy Awards this year and see how my picks pan out!
