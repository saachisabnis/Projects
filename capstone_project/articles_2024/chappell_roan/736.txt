One of the cooler things in the music festival circuit of the past decade or so has been the continued success of All Things Go, the annual Washington, D.C.-area gathering that has proven, year in and year out, that a diverse lineup led by women and non-binary bands and artists can pack whatever venue it sets up shop in. 
Now, after selling out three consecutive years at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland, All Things Go has expanded to New York City — and it’s bringing an absolutely iconic lineup along for the ride.
The inaugural New York City edition of All Things Go goes down at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, and takes place September 28 and 29 — the same weekend as its southern counterpart. And as we suggested, the lineup is fantastic: The fest is headlined by Chappell Roan, Reneé Rapp, Janelle Monáe, Ethel Cain, and Julien Baker, and also features MUNA, Holly Humberstone, Maise Peters, Samia, Mannequin Pussy, Indigo DeSouza, Del Water Gap, Soccer Mommy, Annie DiRusso, Coco & Clair Clair, and Towa Bird. 
Like, damn. 
Tickets for New York’s All Things Go will go on sale Friday (June 14) at 10 a.m. ET via the festival homepage linked above. Peep the poster below.
