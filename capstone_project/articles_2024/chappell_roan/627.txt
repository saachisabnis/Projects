In a new session for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, Sabrina Carpenter has performed a cover of "Good Luck, Babe!" by Chappell Roan.
Both Carpenter and Roan have been going viral on the internet and experiencing a huge rise in popularity over the past year or so. Speaking to Rolling Stone Carpenter recently revealed that she’s had “Good Luck, Babe!” on “loopty loop", so it makes complete sense that she chose to cover the track for her Live Lounge performance in which she also performed "Please Please Please" and "Espresso".
