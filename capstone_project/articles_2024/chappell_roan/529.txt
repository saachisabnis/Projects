The pre-Election Day episode of “Saturday Night Live” has become a staple of the long-running sketch comedy series, on par with other celebratory-themed episodes they do for Halloween and Christmas. And while it may be hard to laugh about this particular election cycle, with half the country seemingly still ready to vote for a man who’s about to be sentenced for 34 felony counts against him and who still has further litigation pending related to his attempted coup, “SNL 50” was ready to pull out the big guns to give audiences a reprieve from their anxieties. Before six-time host John Mulaney and first-time musical guest Chappell Roan made their entrance, the crowd was greeted by none other than presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, who joined her “SNL” counterpart Maya Rudolph for a cold open sketch that scratched the funny bone and pulled on the heartstrings.

After cast members James Austin Johnson and Bowen Yang satirized some of Trump and Vance’s most recent gaffes, the scene cut to a green room where Rudolph as Harris was joined by Jim Gaffigan as running mate Tim Walz, Andy Samberg as Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, as well as Dana Carvey as current President Joe Biden. Needing a moment alone, the men leave as Rudolph sits in front of a vanity mirror, wishing she had someone to talk to who could relate to all she’s been facing over the last few months. As Rudolph turns to face the mirror, she’s met with warm, inviting gaze of real-life Vice President Kamala Harris. One the crowd’s excitement finally died down, Harris and Rudolph were able to go on with the sketch, in which both offered support for one another and a plethora of -ala related puns.
Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton made similar appearances on “SNL” ahead of their respective presidential elections, both to differing results. After both Harris’ commenced the episode with “live from New York, it’s SATURDAY NIGHT,” host John Mulaney took the stage to perform some of his new stand up related to his son, newborn daughter, wife Olivia Munn, as well as his mother-in-law. It was a typical monologue from the stand-up comedian, who prefers to rely on his personal material rather than prep an introduction that’s specific to the moment. As expected, Mulaney killed, kicking off an episode anchored by some of his trademark humor.

 









As if Vice President Harris wasn’t enough, “SNL 50” also rolled out the red carpet for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running mate and current Virginia Senator, Tim Kaine. Bringing back one of Bill Hader’s staple sketches, “What’s That Name,” cast member Michael Longfellow took the role of game show host against Mulaney’s contestant, who was forced to remember Kaine’s name despite it clearly escaping him. The sketch was mostly a joke on the similarities between the former VP pick and the current one, as both share similar physical features and the same first name, but also a parody of white liberalism, which views each election and political movement as something to get through rather than something of longtime value. Sarah Sherman also had some fun playing author of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Margaret Atwood, though getting the real author for the sketch might’ve made the final punchline land a bit better.
Another surprise appearance came from former “SNL” cast member Pete Davidson, who returned to join Mulaney and Andrew Dismukes for a new New York musical sketch that joins the ranks of “Diner Lobster” and “Bodega Bathroom.” This time, the action was set at the Duane Reade at Port Authority, where Mulaney tries to dissuade Davidson from drinking the milk found in a small refrigerator behind the cash register. As the set opens up to reveal more of Port Authority, we’re greeted to singing, lactating possums, bum fights, an escaped convict bus driver, and much more. It was a true spectacle to behold and maintained one of Mulaney long-held traditions: Calling out New York’s weirdness in a musical theater-style extravaganza.
