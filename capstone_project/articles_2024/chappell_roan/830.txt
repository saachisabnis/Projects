GloRilla nabs her second top 10-charting effort on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart (dated Oct. 26), and with her best sales week yet, as Glorious debuts at No. 6. The title arrives at No. 6 with nearly 12,000 copies sold in the U.S. in the week ending Oct. 17, according to Luminate. The album was available in both a standard and bonus track digital download edition, as well as a signed CD edition.

	GloRilla previously visited the top 10 with Anyways, Life’s Great… in 2022, debuting and peaking at No. 6.

	










Glorious additionally opens in the top 10 across multiple other charts: Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (No. 2), Top Rap Albums (No. 2), Top Streaming Albums (No. 4) and the Billboard 200 (No. 5) – all with her best ranks yet on each chart.

Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart’s history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album units and streaming equivalent album units.

	Elsewhere on the Top Album Sales chart, Jelly Roll racks up his best sales week ever, and first No. 1, as Beautifully Broken bows atop the list with 114,000 sold. The album’s opening week sales were bolstered by its availability across seven vinyl variants, three CD variants (the CDs sold a combined 65,000, including a signed edition sold through the artist’s webstore), a cassette tape and three download album variants (the downloads sold 32,000). Net profits from pre-orders of the CD and vinyl in his webstore benefitted four charity organizations.

	Charli XCX’s Brat flies 25-2 with 48,000 (up 1,281%) for its highest rank and best sales week yet. The surge follows the album’s two deluxe reissues released in the week ending Oct. 17. All versions of the album are combined for tracking and charting purposes. For the deluxe reissues (dubbed Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat), the album’s original tracklist was supersized on Oct. 11 to add in 16 remixes of the set’s songs (with guests including The 1975 and Ariana Grande; available on vinyl, CD, cassette and digital download). Then, on Oct. 14, the deluxe was plussed, adding a remix of “Spring Breakers” featuring Kesha (available as a digital download purchase).

	










	Chappell Roan’s former No. 1 The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess dips 2-3 (14,000; up 6%), Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet is steady at No. 4 (14,000; up 6%), Coldplay’s Moon Music falls 1-5 in its second week (12,000; down 89%), Stray Kids’ chart-topping ATE rises 8-7 (9,000; up 7%), Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft jumps 12-8 (8,000; up 14%) and ENHYPEN’s chart-topping Romance: Untold rises 13-9 (7,000; up 10%).

	Rounding out the top 10 is Myles Kennedy with the arrival of The Art of Letting Go, bowing at No. 10 with nearly 7,000. It’s the sixth top 10 for the artist.
