Chappell was Olivia’s top song on her 2024 Spotify Wrapped. 🥹
If you were lucky enough to snag tickets to Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS Tour, you likely had the pleasure of witnessing Chappell Roan’s star rise as her opening act. If you danced along to “Hot to Go!” or found a little too much of yourself in the narrative of the situationship anthem “Casual” and wondered how Chappell and Olivia crossed paths to begin with, allow me to catch you up to speed! Chappell first opened for Liv’s SOUR Tour in 2022, and they actually go way back. Both girlies also work with producer Dan Nigro on the reg—so much so that Chappell ended up serving background vocals for both of Olivia’s albums. 
Ahead, find every detail of Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan’s friendship timeline from the beginning of their sweet friendship to now. 
Chappell moved to L.A. and started working with music producer Dan Nigro (who eventually began working with Olivia in 2020).
The “Pink Pony Club” singer announced that she was joining Olivia on one of her SOUR Tour dates. “OMG I’M OPENING FOR @oliviarodrigo MAY 27 SAN FRANCISCO . I love u SO MUCH Olivia & I can’t wait !!!! LETS GOOO💜✨💜✨💜✨💜,” she wrote. Liv also left some love in the comments, writing, “YASSSSS LOVE U.”
Olivia attended Chappell’s birthday party! The “Femininomenon” singer also posed for a pic with Dan, Olivia, and Conan Gray that same night.
Chappell supported Olivia on the SOUR Tour and penned a lengthy caption showing her gratitude. 🥹 “This was f*cking crazy. Thank you @oliviarodrigo for asking me to open. It was truly an honor. Your fans were the sweetest angels to me,” she wrote in part.
Olivia supported Chappell at her headlining show at NYC’s Bowery Ballroom, and dear reader, she had the time of her life:
And while this is from a different show, Olivia and Conan joined in on Chappell’s “Hot to Go!” choreo: 
^^ That’s the only appropriate energy to have at a Chappell show, btw.
Chappell gave a shout-out to all her female friends who got her through 2022 and included a pic of her with Olivia backstage at her NYC show in August. “This year has been a femininomenon (❀ˆᴗˆ)(•́ᴗ•̀✿) thank u to my friends for everything,” she wrote in her caption.
NYLON joined Chappell for her first-ever NYC Pride, where she got candid about receiving support from Olivia and turning to her for advice regarding haters. “I [asked Rodridgo], ‘When you were getting big, did you talk to Billie [Eilish]? What did you do?’ And she was like, ‘I don’t have the answers—I’m sorry. No one has the answers.’”
She continued, “She’s so good at being a normal person when everything is abnormal around her. I don’t feel like a normal person right now, and I’m not even near where she is.”
Olivia’s GUTS Tour is announced, and Chappell broke the news that she’d be heading on the road with the “Vampire” hitmaker once more.
When asked how she felt about opening for Olivia, Chappell told Triple J’s radio host, “I’m so grateful that she even asked me. I was like, ‘Oh my god...I’ve only played my first headline show last May, and to go from, like, 200 people to 20,000 in less than two years is very intense and fast.”
She continued, “But I’m so excited because I opened for her one time in San Francisco last May as well, and it was 9,000 [people]. It was a lot less, but the energy was so electric because a lot of her fans are younger than my fans.”
Chappell recounted an instance where she turned to Olivia for advice on grappling with fame during an interview with The Independent. “I was just really struggling...with the bullying online,” Chappell revealed. “I was going to reach out to Phoebe Bridgers and see what she was doing and I asked Olivia if she had talked to Billie [Eilish] or anything. People who are in similar circumstances.”
She added that Olivia’s answer was “kind of sad,” saying, “She was just like, ‘No one has it figured out. No one has the answer. It’s different for every person.’ I do think it was really helpful for me to hear that no matter who you are or how big you are or how small you are, you feel the same.”
During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Olivia revealed that Chappell was her top artist on her Spotify Wrapped roundup for the year. “My Spotify Wrapped just came out. I think my number one artist was Chappell Roan. She just put out her first album, and Dan, my producer, produced it, and it’s amazing. So I’m listening to a lot of her. And I think number two was Simon & Garfunkel,” she dished.
In a rare long-form interview breaking down her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, Chappell revealed that she did background vocals for “Lacy,”  “Obsessed,” and “Bad Idea, Right?” on Olivia’s album. 
Chappell made a TikTok giving some fun facts about herself and her friendship with Olivia ahead of the GUTS Tour and her own headlining Midwest Princess Tour. “I love you, girl. I’m so excited to tour with you,” she said in the clip.
In a video interview with Time, Chappell gushed about Liv handling criticism with grace throughout her career.
Chappell celebrated her last night on the GUTS Tour by surprising Olivia during her fan interaction portion of the show.
Olivia also posted a sweet film pic with Chappell on her Instagram Stories after the show.
Because Chappell is somewhat of a drag performer herself, she was asked what the name of Olivia’s drag persona would be in an interview with ETalk. The answer? Sophia Rodriguez, because “everyone calls her Rodriguez instead of Rodrigo all the time.” According to a convo she had with Olivia recently, the “Good 4 U” singer was almost named Sophia. The more you know! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Olivia curated an Insta photo dump to capture moments from the GUTS Tour, featuring this cute pic taken by Chappell’s tour photographer, Lucienne. 
It may seem like a “teenage dream,” but it’s not—Chappell joined Olivia for a surprise performance of “HOT TO GO!” at her GUTS World Tour stop in L.A. The pair even took part in a silly TikTok trend, where Olivia says, “I hope she plays ‘HOT TO GO!’” and Chappell responds, “This is an Olivia Rodrigo concert, bitch.”
Oh, and check out pics from their high-energy performance:
Liv gushed all about her friendship with Chappell and reminisced on their duet of “Hot to Go!” back in August.
"Well, I certainly didn’t have to learn 'Hot to Go!' I think that was actually one of my top five Spotify songs like two years ago, so I know that song like the back of my hand. I love it so much, and it was so much fun to perform with her," Olivia told Variety before revealing the crowd's screams were the loudest she had ever heard during a performance.
"I’ve heard some pretty loud screams in my life. I’ve been lucky to hear lots of girls losing their minds over the years, and I truly don’t think I’ve ever heard a scream as loud as the scream I heard when I said that Chappell was coming on stage. People were so excited — I swear to God, they just screamed bloody murder for like six minutes. It was awesome." 
She continued, "But yeah, I’m really happy that she’s in this movie. She’s been there for so much of my journey, and I’ve been sort of there for her as we’ve known each other for a long time. She opened for my SOUR tour, too, actually, and she does background vocals on both of my albums. So we’re very intertwined in each other’s worlds, and I think it was only fitting that she was included in this movie, since she was such a huge part of this tour."
The very next day after her GUTS World Tour film dropped, Olivia appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to speak about the experience. Of course, she talked about Chappell joining her on stage at the Forum. 
"She opened for me on this tour and she's actually in the concert film, which is really fun, but I've actually known her for so many years," Olivia told Jimmy. 
She continued, revealing how far they really go back. "I love her. I used to go visit her when she worked at a donut shop, before she got signed, before she put out any of her music. I used to just go eat donuts with her and hang out."
Spotify Wrapped was officially released on December 4 and Olivia posted her results just like the rest of us. For the second year in a row, Chappell topped Liv's Wrapped—this time, her top song was "Good Luck, Babe!" and she commemorated the occasion on her Instagram Stories. 
"I know that's right," Olivia posted alongside the screenshot, tagging Chappell and their shared producer, Dan Nigro.
Chappell and Olivia reunite at the 2025 Grammys!
