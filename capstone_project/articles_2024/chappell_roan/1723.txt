Chappell Roan canceled both of her appearances at the All Things Go Festival over the weekend. The pop superstar was scheduled to perform in New York on Saturday (September 28) and in Washington, D.C. on Sunday (Sept. 29), but Roan backed out of both dates in order to focus on her mental health and personal well-being. “I apologize to people who have been waiting to see me in NYC & DC this weekend at All Things Go, but I am unable to perform,” Roan wrote in an Instagram story on Friday (Sept. 27). “Things have gotten overwhelming over the past few weeks and I am really feeling it. I feel pressures to prioritize a lot of things right now and I need a few days to prioritize my health. I want to be present when I perform and give the best shows possible. Thank you for understanding. Be back soon.” Roan’s next scheduled date on her Midwest Princess Tour is on Tuesday, October 1 in Franklin, Tennessee, with the show still set to go on as planned as of press time. (Variety)
