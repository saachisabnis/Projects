She's one of the most nominated artists at next year's Grammy Awards, but Chappell Roan is more than happy to walk away empty handed.
In a resurfaced interview with The Face from September, the 26-year-old admitted that she didn't want to win a gong at the Grammys. 
'I'm kind of hoping I don't win,' she told the publication.
'Because then everyone will get off my a**. ​"See guys, we did it and we didn't win, bye!" I won't have to do this again!'
She added, 'My mom would love to go to the Grammys or the Brits.'

In the same interview, Roan admitted that she wanted to 'quit right now' and 'take next year off.'
The songstress scored six nominations at the 2025 Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year.
It comes after Roan was praised by fans for 'defending herself' as she delivered an expletive-laden response while posing for photos ahead of the VMAs in September.
In footage of the incident, a photographer was heard shouting: 'Shut the f*** up,' Chappell turned and bellowed back: 'YOU shut the f*** up!'
She added: 'No! Not me, b****!' prompting whoops from some of the observers on the scene.
'Tell him, girl,' said one woman who was watching the encounter. 
The star has previously been vocal about her exasperation over 'weird' fans making her 'uncomfortable' with their intrusive behavior - prompting a backlash from social media users who felt she was being ungrateful for her stardom.  
Roan recently voiced her 'frustration' that people are only now beginning to take her seriously as an artist.

The Pink Pony Club singer made the comments in a cover story for the outlet which was published on Tuesday.
'What's so infuriating is how people are just now taking me seriously,' she expressed. 
'Like, "You know what, b***h? I've been doing this s*** and you're just now catching up."
'Part of me hopes I never have a hit again because then no one will ever expect anything from me again,' the star told Rolling Stone.
