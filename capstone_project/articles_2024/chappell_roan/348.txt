Meet Generation Z, the cohort born into a world where the internet, cell phones and iPods have always existed. For them, these technologies are not innovations but the very fabric of life as they've known it from an extremely young age.
If you're uncertain about where they fall on the generational timeline, read on to delve into the Gen Z age range and explore what truly sets this tech-savvy generation apart.

Many experts disagree on when exactly Generation Z begins. Some argue that the inaugural members were born in 1995 while others contend that 1996 marks the beginning of Gen Z.
However, the Pew Research Center, a widely recognized authority, provides a more specific definition. To maintain the analytical significance of the millennial generation and to explore the unique characteristics of the next cohort, the organization decided in 2018 to use 1996 as the final birth year for millennials.

According to their reporting, those born from 1997 to 2012 belong to Generation Z. This definition places the current age range of Generation Z at approximately 12 to 27 years old.
What is not in dispute is what sets this generation apart from any that came before, and that's the unique era in which they are being raised.

This group has lived their entire life with instant access to mountains of data on any topic that flutters through their imaginations. They've never known the frustration or sheer physical effort of rifling through the M-O volume of the encyclopedia to find out about the Magna Carta.
They're technologically savvy and just as likely to spend their time writing and programming video games as simply playing them.

But they also grew up in a world shaped by 9/11, Columbine and the War on Terror. They have a sense of social justice, philanthropy and maturity that comes with growing up during one of the most severe economic recessions in history.
A lot of kids these days prefer texting to actually holding a conversation with someone. The invention of short message service (SMS) makes you wonder how necessary the telephone would have been if Alexander Graham Bell had thought of texting first.
Generation Z prefers texting because it offers instant, efficient communication that aligns with their fast-paced, digitally connected lives. Texting also allows them to multitask and maintain multiple conversations simultaneously without the pressure of real-time responses, making it a convenient and (theoretically) low-stress way to stay connected.
Instead of having a single face-to-face or phone conversation that may cover a multitude of topics over several minutes, some Zoomers would rather communicate in spurts of shorter, but more frequent, bursts of information.
A 2023 study from Common Sense Media and the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital states that U.S. teens receive an overwhelming 237 or more daily notifications from their phones, including text messages.
And this gets to the heart of one of Gen Z's key differentiators: They crave constant and immediate feedback. This is the result of having every whim addressed with a few keystrokes.
Want to know who played bass on the new Chappell Roan album? Google it. Forgot which chapters to read for biology? Text a classmate.
The days of leaving a voicemail or shooting off an e-mail and waiting for a reply are long gone — and may have never really been part of this group's routine anyway. They need information now, and they're going to use the Internet and social media to get it.
But if this makes Gen Z seem like an over-stimulated, impatient lot, then consider for a second the challenges they recognize in their future.
For their entire lives, they've heard about the dangers of global warming, been subjected to terror alerts of varying colors and watched their parents weather the recent economic crisis.
This growing awareness of financial challenges reflects the broader economic anxieties that many in this generation face as they come of age during uncertain times.
They see themselves as the solution to these problems and, as a result, are more likely to pursue careers they think will help society. And because of their ubiquitous use of social networking, they're quick to jump in and help when their circle of contacts alerts them to a need.
This use of mobile technology makes them more available and being solicited by friends is more likely to interest them.

Generation Z goes by many nicknames. Here are just a few.

Every generation has trouble with the one that comes behind them. Their clothes don't fit right (or fit too right), their music is too loud and they have no respect for anything.
Things change faster than anyone realizes, and they rarely go back. Educators have been on the front lines of the Gen Z migration into adolescence and adulthood, and they recognize that this group is different.

More diverse than previous generations of Americans, Gen Z brings new perspectives and challenges to the classroom, reshaping educational approaches and expectations.
One of the challenges the constant flow of information presents is that when tasked with solving a problem, Gen Z students look for the quick answer rather than work toward solving the problem on their own. Their instinct is to pursue speed instead of accuracy.
Maybe the biggest hurdle facing teachers is that they're not on their home turf. They've had to learn technology as it was developed, experiencing these advancements as they happen while their students are "digital natives," meaning they've been raised in an environment where every piece of technology is intuitive, logical and mature.
At home, this diverse generation is being raised by statistically older parents, and they may be the last wave in a four-stage generational cycle that repeats itself known as the Fourth Turning.
Members of Generation X, or the MTV Generation, are now the parents, and they're more likely to be divorced and prefer to work outside the home.

According to some, absenteeism compounds an issue already at work in Gen X's parenting style: overindulgence. The overriding desire for parents today is to raise children with high self-esteem, even if that means never correcting them or challenging them to achieve something beyond their reach.
This approach to attachment parenting could be Gen X looking to overcompensate for being raised by Baby Boomers, who bucked traditional roles in the marriage, experienced the first spike in divorce rates and virtually invented the latchkey kid.

As a result, Gen X may have instilled in their children a stronger sense of security and attachment to home, which is reflected in Generation Z's behavior. They are also less likely to move out of the home than previous generations were at the same age.
In fact, studies show that young adults today, including those in Generation Z, are moving at lower rates compared to earlier generations like millennials and Gen Xers at the same stage in life. Several factors contribute to this trend, including economic challenges, higher student debt, rising housing costs and a preference for stability or staying close to family.
And of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has further reduced mobility, as remote work and education have made it easier to stay in one place.

Fortunately, it looks as though the planet is in capable hands. We've already discussed the generation's technological savvy and how information is at their fingertips, but this group is also more self-directed.

These kids and young adults have little need to await direction; they can access whatever information they need relatively freely, and that information is usually enough to base a decision on (provided it's not the misinformation that plagues social media and the rest of the internet).
In the workplace, these young adults expect flexibility. When Baby Boomers entered the workforce, working for the same company their entire career was a barometer of success. Gen Z has little interest in being a desk jockey for 40 hours a week.
Instead, Zoomers view themselves as professional, permanent freelancers. They swoop in with their particular expertise, collect their bones and be off to the next project. At least that's how they see themselves.
Finally, some argue that this generation is smart — maybe even smarter than previous generations. Their ability to process massive amounts of information quickly is actually preparing them to perform more mentally demanding jobs. In effect, an entire generation is training itself to handle more complicated tasks.
And as Generation Z grows into their roles, keep an eye on the up-and-coming Generation Alpha. With their innate comfort with technology and knack for adapting to new tools and environments, they might just take this trend even further, redefining what it means to be a freelancer in the digital age.
