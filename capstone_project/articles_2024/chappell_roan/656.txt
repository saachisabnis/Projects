It comes after the singer teased her sophomore album last month
Chappell Roan debuted a new country song, ‘The Giver’ on Saturday Night Live.
Ahead of her musical guest spot last night (November 2), she took to Instagram to share a Facebook post of hers from 2011, where she shared her hopes of one day being on the show, saying: “I am determined to be on SNL.”
She performed ‘The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess’ track ‘Pink Pony Club’, and then surprised fans by debuting the new song.
Joined by a fiddler, she sang: “You ain’t got to tell me, it’s just in my nature / So, take it like a taker, ’cause baby, I’m a giver / Ain’t no need to help me, ’cause baby I deliver… ain’t no country boy quitter / I get the job done” on its chorus.
Then, during the song’s bridge, she says to the audience: “All you country boys saying you know how to treat a woman right. Well, only a woman knows how to treat a woman right.”
Back in July, producer Dan Nigro told The New York Times fans could expect a “fun, up-tempo country song” that featured a fiddle, and said it would show “a new version” of the ‘Good Luck, Babe!’ singer.
‘The Giver’ is already being dubbed a “lesbian anthem” for it’s celebratory take on topping. “I just get so emotional thinking about how we finally have queer figures in pop culture that are able to SCREAM about how queer they are,” reflected one fan underneath a clip of the performance.
“No innuendos, no theorising, no vague lyrics to avoid controversy; she’s screaming it from the rooftops and not allowing any way around it. No room for interpretation, just Chappell screaming “only a woman knows how to treat a woman right” live on SNL. We’ve come so far guys,” one fan wrote. You can check out more fan reactions below.

Last night’s show also featured a surprise appearance from Kamala Harris. Roan had made headlines earlier this year after she said she wasn’t going to throw her undivided support behind any one candidate in the election, due to “problems” on both sides.
Following fan uproar on her comments, she later went on to further clarify her stance, saying: “I’m voting for fucking Kamala, but I’m not settling for what has been offered. Because that’s questionable. It’s questionable, the actions of our government, of the internet, of you and me.”
Premiering ‘The Giver’ comes after Roan teased her highly anticipated sophomore album. Last month, she shared a post on Instagram, where she hinted at the upcoming project with a reference to Love Island.
In the carousel post, she holds up her debut album, and another slide on the post sees her with a microphone in her hand, seemingly in a recording studio. She wrote on the caption: “Album kinda popped off imo but it is time to welcome a hot new bombshell into the villa.”
