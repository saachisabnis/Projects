Holiday viewing
"Carpool Karaoke" is making a triumphant Christmas comeback. The segment, which initially aired as a part of James Corden's late-night TV show, has announced a Christmas-themed episode, featuring some of this year's leading pop stars. 
Hosted by Zane Lowe, the Christmas episode dropped over the weekend and features Chappell Roan, Lady Gaga, and Dua Lipa in a new episode. The women joined Lowe on separate car rides as they all sang with different guests, including Roan's parents.
The women joined Lowe for some holiday classics and performances of their own songs, including Gaga's "Disease," which came out this year, and "Shallow," which she performed alongside Bradley Cooper in the film "A Star Is Born." 
Through the segments, the musicians discussed their careers, the upcoming Grammys, and more. 
In the case of Roan, she was nominated for six Grammys after a year of explosive success, which launched her as one of the most significant pop stars in the world. She's seen performing "Pink Pony Club" and "Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl." 
For Lipa's segment, she's seen driving the vehicle in Tokyo and performing Christmas songs and "New Rules," one of her biggest and first hits. 
Corden was also featured, making a cameo appearance through a phone call. The episode is now streaming on Apple TV+. You can check out the trailer below. 
The program's trailer shows Lowe speaking on the phone with Corden who asks him the favor to pick up three of his friends on different locations. 
“Sure mate,” said Lowe. “Just tell me where they are.”
“Tokyo, Missouri and Los Angeles,” Corden said with a wince, prompting a "Whoa" from Lowe.
As the singers join Lowe, they're seen singing various Christmas songs while hanging out in Lowe's car, which is decorated with various Christmas ornaments.
