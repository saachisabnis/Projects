Bill Maher has high praise for Chappell Roan when it comes to calling out BS ... but he says she's clueless when it comes to the Middle East.
The "Real Time" host says Chappell has no understanding of Israel's claim to its land because she's getting her news from TikTok, which Bill says is like getting your calories from Hostess.
He calls CR out for calling out Israel as colonizers, explaining colonizers are intruders who have no history in an area they seek to conquer. Watch the vid ... Bill explains Israel's history with its territory.
But his biggest point ... Chappell and other Gen-Zers are embracing Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, the Taliban and other terrorist groups despite the fact those groups abuse and kill women, members of the LGBTQ community and others who don't follow the program.
Maybe the most impactful part of Bill's take is what Meryl Streep said about the Taliban -- how women under its rule have fewer rights than a cat. Again, watch the video ... her reasoning deserves some thought.
