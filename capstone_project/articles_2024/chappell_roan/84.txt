AEW American Champion Maxwell Jacob Friedman will be facing off against Kyle Fletcher on this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite.
On Saturday night’s edition of Collision, Fletcher defeated Brian Cage. This led to a fan on Twitter attempting to troll MJF by mentioning Vince McMahon.
Initially, MJF wrote, “You can thank me later 🦘 Also cut your hair. You look like MGK and Ellen Degeneres’s dumpster baby.”
This resulted in a Twitter user responding with the following, “Vinny Mac would never allow his top guy to say something like this.”
True to form, MJF clapped back in only a way he knows how, writing, “You’re right. He’d ask me to f**k his secretary in front of him while he sh*ts on her head. Get lost Bot.”
As many of you know by now, former WWE employee Janel Grant has filed a lawsuit against Vince McMahon, WWE, and John Laurinaitis, alleging claims of sex trafficking, sexual assault and more.

You’re right. He’d ask me to fuck his secretary in front of him while he shits on her head. Get lost Bot.

Taking to Twitter on Saturday night, Willow Nightingale invited pop singer Chappell Roan to attend a future AEW event. She wrote,
“Hi @ChappellRoan! If you ever want to come to a wrestling show, you’re always welcome at @AEW.”
