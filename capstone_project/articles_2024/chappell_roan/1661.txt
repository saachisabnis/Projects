CHICAGO, Ill. (KY3) - Pop superstar and Willard, Mo., native Chappell Roan took the first day of Lollapalooza in Chicago by storm.
The four-day music festival kicked off Thursday, and according to the schedule, Roan started her set at 5 p.m. on the T-Mobile stage, one of the two main stages that bookend the festival grounds.
Lollapalooza officials say her crowd was the biggest daytime set the festival has ever seen. Officials also said, “It was a magical moment added to Lolla’s DNA.”
Rolling Stone magazine says the performance was more like a headline set without actually headlining. The magazine also states festival organizers switched Roan’s original performance time on a smaller stage across the field with another pop star, Kesha.
The festival took to social media, showing the expansive crowd’s support for Roan.
Roan has had quite the summer with two songs, “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Hot To Go.”
Her latest single, “Good Luck Babe,” reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
