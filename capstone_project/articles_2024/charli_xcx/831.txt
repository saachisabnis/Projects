Another day, another EmRata slay. On August 20, the supermodel and High Low podcast host took her pup, Colombo, out for a walk in New York City when a stranger straight-up told her to put clothes on. She wore a low-cut gray tank top from Tank Air, black yoga pants, gold hoop earrings, and glasses as the random man body-shamed her.
Emily even caught the whole interaction on camera and posted it on TikTok, writing, “Wait for it: a man tells me to put on a shirt.” As she crosses the street in the clip, he says, “Girl, put on a shirt.” 😬
On top of... ^^^ all of that, Emily simultaneously took part in two major trends. In true Brat fashion, she soundtracked the moment with Charli XCX’s “365” while captioning her post with “famously not demure, famously not mindful,” referencing the hilarious videos popularized by Jools Lebron.
Moments like these actually inspired Emily to take control of her narrative through her book of essays, My Body, in 2021. The project includes intimate accounts of her experiences of being objectified by the media and unintentionally being at the forefront of modern feminism. 
Naturally, fans flocked to EmRata’s TikTok comments section in her defense, writing, “Imagine saying that to Emily Ratajkowski,” and “I love the no reply he’s gotta b embarrassed😭.” And in a major moment of ~girlhood~, one user suggested, “We should band together and all by and wear the same top.” And to that, I say...I’m running to buy one right now!
