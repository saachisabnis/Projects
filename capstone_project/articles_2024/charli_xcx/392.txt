Brat summer is heading to the big screen. Charli XCX is joining Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman in Gregg Araki’s erotic thriller I Want Your Sex, per Variety. We don’t have details about her role yet, but presumably, Charli will be helping Wilde’s Erika Tracy have her own party-girl summer after striking up a relationship with Hoffman’s Elliott. Are we even ready for the power of this MILF phenomenon? This won’t be Wilde or Hoffman’s first time working alongside a pop star, after Wilde directed her ex Harry Styles in Don’t Worry Darling and Hoffman broke out in Licorice Pizza alongside Alana Haim. It will be just Charli’s second acting role, though, after Daniel Goldhaber’s upcoming Faces of Death remake. But as someone who knows how it’s confusing sometimes to be a girl, we’re sure she has a lot to bring to her mystery part.
