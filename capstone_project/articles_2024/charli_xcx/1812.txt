Charli XCX was unwilling to let the celebrations come to an end after the BRIT Awards on Saturday night at the O2, as she threw another party following the other star-studded bashes.
The British singer, 31, first appeared at the Warner Music afterparty at the Nomad Hotel, along with famous faces like Dua Lipa and Kylie Minogue.
She put on a daring display in a draped burgundy gown, which boasted a plunging neckline to show a glimpse of her ample cleavage.
Her jet black hair was slicked back in neat curls and she boosted her height with pointed high heels. 
Despite missing out on the award for Best British Pop Act at the ceremony, Charli was still in the mood to party.

And when the party came to a close, she stayed true to her hit song After The Afterparty, by hosting another bash in her luxury suite.
Charli was joined by her fiancé and The 1975 drummer George Daniel, as they invited a slew of celebrities to continue dancing the night away.
Even after Charli's after afterparty finally came to a close, the stars continued multiple suite parties in the hotel until the early hours. 
She recently revealed that she's working on new music with George, 33, for her next album, following their engagement in November.
She told the Spout podcast at the end of last year: 'We've done a couple of things together. We've got a few ideas in the works.
'It's funny, I have never been in a relationship with someone that I've worked with, so it's like a whole new dynamic, but it's cool.
'There will probably be a couple of songs that he's worked on with me.'

Charli and George first worked together in 2021, when they joined forces to record Spinning and and collaborated once again on her album crash.
The BRIT Awards saw Raye break records, as she won six gongs during a star-studded ceremony at London's O2 arena.
The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada. 
As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. 
The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.

Dua Lipa picked up the fan-voted Pop Act gong, gushing to her fans: 'I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I'm standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me.' 
A record 98 artists were up for the new 2024 BRIT award, which has been designed by British visual artist and painter Rachel Jones.
The only men to get accolades were Calvin Harris for dance act; Sheffield quartet Bring Me The Horizon in the alternative/rock category; Casisdead for best hip-hop, grime or rap act; and duo Jungle for group of the year. 
Miley Cyrus was a notable absentee on the night, sending her thanks for her International Song win for her smash hit Flowers in a video message.
'Hello to everybody at the Brits. I wanted to say thank you so much for voting Flowers as the international song of the year, and a special thank you for giving me somewhere to wear this dress, she said, showing off her minuscule gold number.
'It's incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.' 
Dua Lipa and Ellie Goulding pulled out all the stops as they led the performances. 
Double nominee Dua, 28, opened the ceremony with her new song Training Season from her upcoming her third studio album. 
She recently revealed that she's working on new music with George, 33, for her next album, following their engagement in November (pictured together in May) 
The songstress looked incredible in an all leather look while Ellie, 37, stormed the stage just a week after announcing the end of her marriage. 
The evening ended with Dua Lipa presenting Kylie with the Global Icon Award, leading into the Aussie popstar's finale performance.
'Alright I’m just gonna be sobbing with Raye, you did that!' an emotional Kylie said as she took to the stage.
'You did that. Brits, thank you so much. I really tried to think hard about what to say tonight but I knew I couldn’t plan anything and I knew it’d be just about the emotion.'
'For some of you it’s been a lifetime – 36 years and counting of experiences together and the thing that really gets me is the love of music and connection with people … I have friends in this room that I’ve worked with through the years.'
The pop superstar then took to the stage for a medley of her greatest hits including her recent chart smash Padam Padam, Can’t Get You Out Of My Head, Slow and Love At First Sight.
