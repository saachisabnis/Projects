Lorde has returned to the studio. The singer has been teasing her Solar Power follow-up for some time now.
Last month, she posted a clip of music just mere seconds long of her nodding along to a techno beat with the caption, “Will be back in touch.”
Producer Jim-E Stack has confirmed the buzz with a photo of Lorde in a recording studio working on her computer.

Stack has produced music for the likes of Bon Iver, Empress Of, The Kid LAROI, Dominic Fike, Caroline Polachek and more. He’s also worked with Charli XCX, who Lorde recently linked up with for the “Girl, so confusing” remix.
Lorde’s last effort, Solar Power, was released in 2021, following 2013’s debut Pure Heroine and 2017’s sophomore effort Melodrama.
