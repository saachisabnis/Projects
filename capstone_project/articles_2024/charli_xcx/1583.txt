Mercury Prize Nominees 2024​
GUESS WHO GOT IT HORRIBLY WRONG LAST YEAR?
Ahem. Anyways.
Last year, I made my thoughts clear on the names that were put up for the Mercury Prize. Safe to say, I couldn't have been more incorrect. Maybe, this year, I can make up for my misdeeds and get the right prediction for once. Hopefully.
Charli XCX - BRAT​
The easiest nomination you'll see all year. Loads of pop bangers, tales of what it's like to be a woman in the decade of our lord, the 2020s, and a sense that she would need to cut the head off a live chicken if she were to have a Top 20 hit. So obviously this isn't winning. I know how this award works.
The Last Dinner Party - Prelude To Ecstasy​
No shocks here either lads, guitar music's latest hopefuls casually swaying the critics over with their Wet Leg-meets-Florence + the Machine approach. I'm secretly praying they win it, but I know that ain't happenin', dawg.
CMAT - Crazymad, for Me
Ah yes, CMAT, a lady who is universally adored back in Ireland, but can't really add up to much outside of Radio 1 on these shores. Eh. Maybe a nomination for the most influential award in the country can attract us to her pop-country style.
Cat Burns - early twenties
Nope. How. Why has this been nominated. This can join Take That's Everything Changes, Ed Sheeran's Divide, and Simply Red's Stars in the list of nominees over the years that don't make a lick of sense. Please don't win, for my credibility's sakes.
Nia Archives - Silence Is Loud
Another national radio magnet that nobody else has really heard of. Sensing a pattern? I'm also not a huge fan of her either.
Corinne Bailey Rae - Black Rainbows
This is her first nomination since 2010. It also has New York Transit Queen on it, which has as much to do with Corinne Bailey Rae as it does with Rod Stewart. So I'd be happy with this winning.
Beth Gibbons - Lives Outgrown
ANOTHER FEMALE!? What are they feeding the girls this year? Anyways, you know Beth, member of Portishead who won it in '95, so don't get upset if she runs away with the trophy.
Ghetts - On Purpose, With Purpose
About time the men got some love. Right then, Ghetts. 40-year old rapper, big with the socially aware crowd, and deserving of it too. Just a shame his album tanked compared to his No.2 peaking effort from 2021.
Barry Can't Swim - When Will We Land?
Meanwhile, Barry Can't Swim is basically a successor to Calvin Harris, suffice to say, a Scotsman making bananas dance music. Songs like Dance of the Crab and Kimbara (which isn't on the album) are testament to this, and yeah, no, he's alright. Stop judging me.
English Teacher - This Could Be Texas
British guitar group, loud and obnoxious, but sometimes slow and obnoxious. 6 Music are in an arranged marriage to their work by now, but they deserve to win for The World's Biggest Paving Slab alone.
BERWYN - Who Am I
BERWYN. AKA, a poor man's Dave. Talks about social commentary and what it's like to be of a colour that's not the majority, but unlike Dave, is physically unable to grab a hit single. Having said that, Dave has a Mercury Prize under his belt, so don't be shocked if BERWYN runs away with it.
corto.alto - Bad With Names
And here's the traditional nominee that I've never heard of. corto.alto is the token jazz nominee. Usually, he wouldn't stand a chance. But after last year's.. ahem... "incident", anything is possible.
And that's that. I'll be back in September to gaze in horror at the winner. Because I know it's gonna be someone I couldn't care less about. Bye.
A
Nevermind. Take that last sentence back. I am secretly the next Doctor Who and I couldn't be more happier for English Teacher winning this thing. Just don't end up like Talvin Singh, Speech Debelle and Gomez, alright?
