In a year containing hyped releases from Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, few would have predicted that the record that would truly come to define the zeitgeist in 2024 would be a messy, erratic hyper-pop album from fringe hero Charli XCX.
But then came Brat. With her sixth album, the 34-year-old British popstar (real name Charlotte Emma Aitchison) exploded after nearly a decade of splattered success: equal parts highs (I Love It, her chart-topping 2012 collaboration with Icona Pop, 2014’s Sucker – containing the bubblegum-sweet Boom Clap – and her contribution to the Barbie soundtrack, Speed Drive) and niche lows (2020’s How I’m Feeling Now failed to produce a breakout hit).
Brat, however, was that rare thing: a commercial juggernaut not rendered uncool by its popularity. When Aitchison declared on X that “Kamala IS Brat,” the Presidential candidate’s team capitalised on their ‘cool’ stamp of approval. A month later, Barack Obama added her track, 365, a celebration of sniffing cocaine (“Should we do a little key? / Should we have a little line?”) to his annual summer playlist. Even those nods of approval from the establishment weren’t enough to slow down the onslaught of Brat – because, you see, Brat is a lifestyle.
The original version of Brat, released back in June, was a collection of 15 songs intended as an ode to hedonism: to sleeping in late or not sleeping at all; to spending your last tenner on cheap cigarettes; to crawling out of bed, head banging, reeking of spirits and questioning your very existence, ready to go out and do it all again.
The album’s slime green cover also took on a life of its own, becoming both a fashion trend and a savvy marketing tool used for billboards and merchandise, not to mention the colour of countless hungover disciples’ morning-after vomit. It didn’t take long for social media users to embrace it as the perfect rattort to the ‘clean girl lifestyle’ – promoting early nights, strict skin care regimes, working out; horror – that has dominated TikTok and Instagram since the pandemic.
It wasn’t just about aesthetics: the music was terrific, too, a toss up between feral club anthems (360, Mean Girls, Club Classics) and slower, more introspective reflections on fame and feminism (Rewind, I Might Say Something Stupid). The release of multiple ‘bonus’ tracks featuring stars like Lorde and Billie Eilish hinted that there was more to come from Brat – and now, here we are, four months on, listening to the deluxe version of the album: Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat.
The existing bonus tracks all feature: Girl, So Confusing sees Aitchinson extend an olive branch to Lorde after years of a rumoured feud (“You told me how you’d been feeling / Let’s work it out on the remix,” Lorde sings, before powerfully detailing her struggle with eating disorders and self-loathing); Guess, with Eilish, undoubtedly the year’s horniest single, hinges on – what else – underwear (and lesbian sex); Talk Talk recruits her Sweat tour co-star, Troye Sivan; Von Dutch has TikTok star-turned-pop sensation Addison Rae literally screaming with ecstasy.
The new remixes/additions are equally starry: Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas, arguably the original Brat (cool, messy, funding his love for getting wrecked with daddy’s money) lends his droll tones to Mean Girls; Bon Iver inflicts I Think About It All the Time, a candid track about motherhood, with his usual atmospheric beats and haunting melodies.

Elsewhere, The 1975’s notoriously controversial frontman Matty Healy – and his bandmates, including Aitchinson’s fiance, George Daniel – keeps tongue firmly in cheek on I Might Say Something Stupid, while Ariana Grande deplores the perilous nature of being a successful woman in music on Sympathy Is a Knife.
The new tracks are all shiny bangers designed to go viral; part of which makes this second version of Brat slightly less special than the original. The album’s magic lay in its messiness – the sense that Aitchinson had simply made another album and managed to strike gold. This time, she’s digging for that gold – she’s never been more famous, so it’s understandable – by recruiting these big names; willing it to storm up the charts and soundtrack every TikTok video made for the next month. Taken alongside Brat’s first iteration, it’s a fun, crazed musical triumph; explored as its own entity, it can feel somewhat like a cynical marketing ploy dreamt up by suited bigwigs.
Ocean Alley, TangerineThe Aussie indie rockers succeed in making us Northern Hemisphere-dwellers jealous of their reversed summer on this sun-drenched track, heavily influenced by Southern Californian pioneers like the Eagles.
Olivia Dean, You Can’t Hurry Love (live at Jools’ Annual Hootenanny)Finally available to stream on Spotify – almost a year after it was performed live on Jools Holland’s NYE Hootenanny – is rising star Olivia Dean’s fabulously frothy cover of the Supremes classic. Try to listen without grooving around your living room and beaming – it’s impossible to resist.
Sebastian Schub, Sing like MadonnaFans of Hozier will lap up this debut single from German singer-songwriter Sebastian Schub: it’s a tender, hopeful ode to pursuing your dreams, anchored by his pleasingly rich vocals.
The Cure, A Fragile ThingAnother beauty from Britain’s kings of goth, taken from their upcoming album Songs of a Lost World. Coming in at just over four minutes, it’s a haunting reflection on life, death and love, and may have been influenced by Robert Smith’s personal grief – he said in 2019 that the new album’s “darkness” was inspired by losing his mother, father and brother.
