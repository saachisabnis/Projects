Vinyl, ruffles, sequins—the red carpets this week were all about bold statements. The best dressed stars embraced unexpected delights, bringing interesting silhouettes and textures to splashy events such as the CFDA Awards in New York City and the star-studded LACMA gala, held just last night in Los Angeles (with a surprise performance from Charli XCX, no less!).
The LACMA gala is always a major showcase for evening wear, so it was no surprise that last evening’s event was heavy on style star power. Chloe Sevigny took a refreshing risk in Saint Laurent’s floral jacket, ruffled top, and layered lace skirt—fresh off the spring 2025 runway. Greta Lee chose a more minimalist look, opting for a sculptural black The Row gown reminiscent of the voluminous white Marc Jacobs dress that Sarah Paulson wore to the WSJ Innovators Awards in New York earlier in the week. Both designs put shapely curves on full display.
Clean column gowns also had a moment this week, though they came complete with ornate embellishments or slinky sequins. In Madrin, Diane Kruger shined in her pink Prada gown with floral embroidery. At the Wicked premiere in Sydney, star Cynthia Erivo looked to a black Louis Vuitton dress with an exaggerated waistline. Ariana Grande, meanwhile, went full Glinda in her pink Vivienne Westwood tulle ball gown. A princess worthy-fit, for sure.
