Gen-Z's convergence of the physical and chronically online self has led to the introduction of a new ... More office vernacular, reshaping professional communications.
One of the most significant shifts currently happening in the workforce is the rise of Generation Z. This cohort, born between the mid-to-late 1990s and the early 2010s, is projected to make up nearly 30% of the labor force by 2025, according to the World Economic Forum.
As digital natives, Gen-Z have no memory of a time before the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media. For this generation, the integration of physical and digital identities have become standard. This convergence of the physical and chronically online self has led to the introduction of a new office vernacular, reshaping professional communications.
Gen-Z's influence on workplace communication blends internet culture, social media trends and diverse linguistic influences into professional settings.
As workplaces become increasingly multigenerational, understanding and adapting to different communication styles is key. Gen-Z employees may choose to "code switch" or adjust their language depending on the context and the colleagues they're interacting with. This approach can help bridge generational communication gaps while still allowing for authentic expression.
The following are some examples of Gen-Z jargon, their meanings and origins.
Please note that this is meant as a fun guide to help you, dear reader, communicate better with your Gen-Z colleagues. When using in-group terms, memes, lingo and phrases in an office setting, it's essential to gauge your audience and the workplace culture.
"Slay" is used as a form of high praise, similar to "killing it." It originated in Black and LGBTQ+ communities and gained widespread popularity through social media platforms like TikTok.
In the workplace context, a Gen-Zer could use "slay" to express strong approval or praise for a colleague's accomplishment or performance. For example, after a successful presentation or project completion, a Gen-Z employee might say to their coworker, "You absolutely slayed that presentation!" This usage conveys enthusiasm and admiration for the colleague's work.
The phrase "no cap" essentially means "I'm telling the truth" or "I'm not lying." Its origins lie in African American Vernacular English and hip-hop culture, where it was used to assert authenticity.
In the workplace, a Gen-Z employee may use "no cap" to emphasize transparency, honesty or sincerity in their statements. For instance, during a meeting, they might say, "No cap, I really think our project will exceed expectations if we stick to this timeline." This usage signals to colleagues that the speaker is being genuine and straightforward about their belief in the project's potential.
"Lit" is used to describe something exciting, enjoyable or cool. This term has roots in jazz culture of the 1910s, but has evolved and gained new popularity among younger generations.
In the workplace, "lit" conveys enthusiasm and positivity, making it a casual way to express approval or excitement about a project, event or achievement.
An appropriate way to use "lit" in a sentence when communicating with a colleague or manager could be: "The team collaboration on this project has been lit; I really appreciate everyone's contributions!" This usage conveys a sense of excitement and positivity about the teamwork involved.
“Rizz” is a slang term that stands for "charisma" and refers to someone's ability to charm or attract others, particularly in romantic contexts. The term was coined by YouTuber and Twitch streamer Kai Cenat and gained widespread popularity in 2022.
It has since become a part of mainstream vernacular and was even named the Oxford English Dictionary's “Word of the Year” for 2023. While "rizz" originally described someone's "game" or ability to woo others, it has evolved to encompass general swagger, self-assurance and coolness.
In the workplace, a Gen-Z employee may use "rizz" to compliment a colleague's charisma or ability to engage others effectively. For example, in a meeting, they could say, "Your presentation had so much rizz; everyone was captivated by your delivery." This usage highlights the colleague's engaging and impressive performance.
"Ick" is used to describe a sudden feeling of disgust or loss of attraction toward someone, often for a trivial reason. This term has roots in psychology, but has been adopted and popularized by Gen-Z.
In a professional setting, using "ick" while maintaining a professional tone can be challenging but achievable. For instance, a Gen-Z employee might say, "I got an ick when I noticed the inconsistencies in the report; we need to address these issues before the client meeting." This usage conveys a sense of discomfort or dissatisfaction with a specific aspect of the work.
The phrase "understood the assignment" is a popular slang expression used to acknowledge someone who has performed exceptionally well or exceeded expectations. It originated from the context of academic or workplace assignments, where understanding the task leads to excellent results.
Its prominence was further boosted by American rapper Tay Money's song, "The Assignment," which included lyrics referencing the phrase.
In an office setting, a Gen-Z employee may say, "Our marketing team really understood the assignment with this campaign; they've exceeded our target metrics and captured our brand essence perfectly."
"Sus," short for suspicious, is used to describe something or someone that seems untrustworthy or questionable. This term gained significant popularity through the online game Among Us.
In the workplace, you may use "sus" in a sentence like this: "The way management handled the layoffs feels sus; it seems like there was no clear communication."
This usage reflects your feelings about trust and transparency.
