If you've ever felt like endless scrolling was melting your brain, you're not alone‚ÄîOxford University Press has declared "brain rot" its word of the year for 2024.
The phrase has seen a staggering 230 percent increase in usage over the past year, reflecting its resonance in contemporary discourse.
Oxford defines "brain rot" as "the supposed deterioration of a person's mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging."
Chosen through a combination of public voting and expert analysis, "brain rot" edged out other finalists, including demure, slop, dynamic pricing, romantasy, and lore.
The term is seen as emblematic of how digital consumption has shaped societal concerns, especially with the proliferation of superficial or unchallenging content online.
Though "brain rot" has become a cultural touchstone in 2024, the phrase has deep historical roots. Its first recorded use dates back to 1854 when Henry David Thoreau referenced it in "Walden," his seminal work on naturalism.
Despite its origins, the modern usage resonates as a critique of the digital age.
Oxford Languages President Casper Grathwohl highlighted its pertinence, stating, "'Brain rot' speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time.
"It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology," he said. "It's not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year."
The competition was stiff, with "brain rot" triumphing over five other finalists, including "romantasy" (a blend of romance and fantasy) and "dynamic pricing," a term increasingly used in economic discussions.
Yet "brain rot" stood out for capturing the zeitgeist, reflecting widespread unease with the effects of relentless online consumption.
Last year's Oxford word of the year, "rizz," showcased the internet's influence on language, describing someone's ability to attract or seduce. Collins Dictionary's 2024 word of the year, meanwhile, is "brat," inspired by the titular album by British pop star Charli XCX that exemplified the ideal of enjoying a "brat-summer."
But it's "brain rot" that encapsulates the digital exhaustion and cultural reflection that defined the past year.
Oxford's selection not only chronicles the evolution of language but also mirrors the anxieties and aspirations of an increasingly screen-focused world. It highlights how society adapts, responds, and evolves in a hyper-digitalized era.
