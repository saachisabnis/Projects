Although every year since 2010 has seemed to have many memes emerge, 2024 was definitely one for the books. With the rise of TikTok, we had so many characters emerge that instantly became meme-able. This generation may be the most unserious one yet. But, it makes for all the more fun. Here are our favorite memes of 2024: 
Where else could we even begin? This king, the Rizzler, lives rent-free in everyone’s mind. As his song says, you may know him as the Rizzler—he’s the panther dressed in black. For those who aren’t chronically online, that’s how he rose to fame: his father posted a video of him in a Black Panther costume, and the internet instantly fell in love. He has somehow become a household name, and many Gen Zers feel a sense of “big sister” or “big brother” energy toward him. Like many other TikTok stars, the Rizzler has started dropping music—and, of course, it’s fire.
Ah, yes. The symphony dolphins. The sarcasm runs rampant on this one. What better way to deliver a self-loathing, deprecating, or hard-to-communicate message than to put it on top of a dolphin scenery with a cheery song? It’s so unserious and all in good fun. We love it. 
Honestly, these hit every year and people often look forward to them more than their actual Spotify Wrapped. They’re always relatable and there’s no shame in admitting that. Everyone’s always so quick to drop these memes too. It’s awesome. 
“You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” lives rent-free in our minds. What does it mean? What is the context? What are the words that come before or after her saying that? We may never know. That is the joy of the meme. 
There’s no better—or more dramatic way—than using this military meme to describe the minor inconveniences in day-to-day life as a Gen Z. 
This paired with a simple “missed the train on my way to class” just makes sense. 
If we had a dollar for every time we’ve heard someone say, “Send it to me Rachel,” we’d have unlimited funds. Why this took the internet by storm, we’re not really sure. But, since it has, “Send it to me Rachel, show it to me please” has become a phrase that is used in our daily lives to replace the question “Can I see?” or “Can you show me?”
This muppet has taken over the internet—more specifically, Pepe the King Prawn from The Muppets has taken over TikTok. This picture is used in TikTok carousels where users give us their tell-alls of insane experiences that have happened to them. The olive oil story. The subway story. If you know, you know. The Pepe meme gives us the excuse to publicly fight our demons (with laughter). 
POV: You show up to office hours on the last week of classes to ask for an extension on a paper that’s due in 24 hours. 
At least you look cute. 🥰
Can’t you just hear this photo? “DOUBLE CHUNK CHOCOLATE COOKIE,” “chicken bake,” and “five big booms” were not on our bingo card for sayings from internet personalities in 2024, but here we are. This father-son duo has quite an excitement for life and has been side questing ever since their first Costco review.  Somehow, somewhere along the way, they have collaborated with the Rizzler, but they are in no way related? Honestly, love this journey for them. 
Not only is this child’s frontal lobe more developed than some college students, she is also funnier and cooler. She’s an icon who knows that she wants to spend her time at the Four Seasons. What a distinguished queen. 
This meme is our new mantra. We will channel this chill guy energy for 2025, and no one will get in the way of this. Big things coming. 🤞🏻
It is 2024’s version of Barbenheimer, Wicked and Gladiator II. We are holding space for Glicked. 
Me in the corner of the function when they ask who is on aux and why they’re playing Gracie Abrams.
Gen Z loves making any slightly attractive person bald with no context. So there’s this. 
This meme was funny for about a week until everyone started overusing it and dragging it out. However, this girl has an accurate depiction of the pep these Chick-fil-A workers have when taking orders. 10/10 service. 
This is Gen Z’s equivalent of elegance. “You see how I do my makeup for work? Very demure, very mindful. I don’t come to work with a green cut crease.” This was a critique of Gen Z on behalf of a Gen Z.
2024 was Jojo Siwa’s year…of getting meme’d.  The former Dance Moms star has always been a polarizing pop-culture figure, but this year, interview after interview, video after video, Jojo was taking the cake on 2024’s cringiest media moments. “Dream guest on my podcast?” “Disney World 21st birthday?” I don’t know which to pick. 
“What’s up, brother?!?!” and “Tuesday Tuesday”—does this sound like a secret language to you? Well, it’s not. It’s probably the top phrase frat boys are using this year to express their profound sense of camaraderie. +1000 aura points if you’re a girl and catch on to the greeting, we guess. The phrase was originally coined by Sketch, a famous Twitch streamer.
Turkish Quandale Dingle. Group Leader. Second in Command. Tomato Boy. These nicknames belong to a group of four boys whose antics have become the stuff of legend. After a DJ released a YouTube video from one of his monthly middle school dance events—later named the “TikTok Rizz Party”—it took the internet by storm. The video captured a sweaty dance floor full of middle schoolers attempting to impress the girls standing behind them.
Instead, a meme was born. The lore surrounding this group is dense and takes time to unpack, but if you’re curious, you can find thousands and thousands of Instagram Reels and TikToks analyzing the power dynamics within their clique. Truly diabolical work.
We have Charli XCX to thank for an iconic album and the brat culture. This is reserved for the divas.
So…2024 will be remembered as the year that Nikocado Avocado tricked us? But we’re not really sure if he did or not because his whole video was about how he’s always two steps ahead and we’ll believe anything he says? As confusing as that was, Gen Z made a meme out of it. Classic. 
In another life, maybe we’ll all reincarnate as a cute, mischievous, famous baby hippo named Moo Deng. One can only hope. 
“You have been promoted! You are now one of my elite employees.” This video scratched an itch that we didn’t know needed to be scratched. We love this icon. 
Mama, a semester behind you 💜 Congrats Terriers, we are so proud of you. 
We hope you and enjoyed these memes and had some laughs (and maybe some cringe moments) along the way. Happy New Year, Terries. Cheers to a little less brain rot in 2025.
