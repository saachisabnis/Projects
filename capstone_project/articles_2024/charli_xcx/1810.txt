"It’s actually BRAT to not get into the Charli XCX DJ set at Glasto"
Charli XCX was joined by Robyn and The xx’s Romy during her set at Glastonbury 2024 – watch footage below.
Last night (June 28), the ‘Brat’ singer took to the Levels stage for ‘Charli XCX Presents Partygirl’, and was joined by Robyn for a performance of ‘With Every Heartbeat’.
Robyn, who previously teamed up with Yung Lean on a for summer-ready remix of ‘360’, has been working with and Charli since last year, when the ‘Von dutch’ singer confirmed they’d been in the studio “making music together”.
Charli was also joined by Romy, who remixed Robyn’s track, ‘Dancing on My Own’.

Fans took to social media to share frustration that her set wasn’t available to watch, with one fan saying: “how in the name of brat summer was charli xcx on a non televised stage at Glastonbury 😭😭😭”
Others were quick to point at the capacity of the venue, which, although in keeping with Charli’s DJ roots, is capped at only 7,000 – joking: “It’s actually BRAT to not get into the Charli XCX DJ set at Glasto.”

Charli recently joined Troye Sivan to perform ‘1999’ at Wembley, and has been playing DJ sets and various live performances throughout the promotion of ‘Brat’.
In a four-star review of the album, NME wrote: “It all paints a picture of who XCX is in 2024.
“Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”. With ‘Brat’, XCX demonstrates that going her own way will always sound pretty good.”
