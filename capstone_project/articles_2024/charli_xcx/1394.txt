In a new interview with Variety, Charli XCX shared details about her recent collaboration with Ariana Grande on the “Sympathy Is A Knife” remix, and the advice that the Wicked star gave her. “She had a lot to say,” Charli recalls. “We went back and forth on the lyrics, talking about all the knives that we both felt in this industry.” Grande had hosted Saturday Night Live back in September, and gave Charli some tips before she served as host and musical guest during a November episode of the sketch comedy show. “She’d obviously just done [‘SNL’] and killed it, so I was getting tips,” Charli reveals. “She was just like, ‘You’re gonna be amazing, just relax, it’s so fun.’” Grande and Charli’s reworking of “Sympathy Is a Knife” is featured on Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat, a remix companion to Charli’s Grammy-nominated sixth studio album, Brat.
