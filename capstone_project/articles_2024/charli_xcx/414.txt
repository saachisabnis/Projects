The 1975’s George Daniel has unveiled the squelchy first track of his new electronic solo project, entitled ‘Screen Cleaner’.
Known for producing The 1975’s material, alongside his production work with Charli xcx, Caroline Polachek and The Japanese House, ‘Screen Cleaner’ comes after a summer of DJ sets alongside xcx, where the musician has been debuting a selection of this new material.
Daniel has also launched dh2 - a new electronic offshoot label of Dirty Hit, which will release his solo work. The label’s first outside signing, Kelly Lee Owens, will release fourth album ‘Dreamstate’ on 18th October.
Daniel has had a big summer, having co-produced ‘Brat’ with fiancé xcx and AG Cook. It was recently announced that The 1975, meanwhile, were being sued for $2.4 million by Malaysia’s Good Vibes festival, after singer Matty Healy protested the country’s anti-LGBTQ laws on stage by kissing bassist Ross Matthews during their set last July.
