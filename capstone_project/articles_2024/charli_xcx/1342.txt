Happy October! Would that we could finally move into sweater weather instead of this “false fall” we’ve been dealt, but I am still burning my cinnamon-y candles in defiance. Even when the temp says 93 degrees, it can still be a cozy autumn in my apartment.
I’ve been working on a personal art project for the majority of my free time, one that I’ll talk more about later this month. While a more sophisticated creator might throw on movies they’ve been meaning to catch as they work, I have instead elected to rewatch all of Twin Peaks. Wow! A real fall activity for the indoor queer, although the weather in this televised Pacific Northwest tends to either be a raging storm or beautiful sunny days. This time around, I’ve come to enjoy and appreciate James Hurley – dumb, sweet boy that he is – and I continue to be out on the Annie storyline. Sorry, dude! They introduce her as a love interest three episodes before the end: There’s no time for real romance to develop. Lynch should have just let Truman and Cooper kiss, but alas. We cannot change the past.
(I just started on The Return, though, so no spoilers! I will report back my thoughts when appropriate. You are also free to ask me about Twin Peaks if you see me in public, as that’s all I have been thinking about lately.)
How are you entering this fall season? A Gilmore Girls marathon? Practical Magic screening? Sipping a pumpkin spice latte from a local establishment and not Seattle-based scum? Even when the weather scorches our desire to wear sweatshirts – my personal desire – we have the ability to make it autumn in our hearts. When the first crisp leaf finally falls, we’ll be prepared.
OH ALSO: RuPaul’s Drag Race is casting once more, looking for all drag artists who have â€œthe Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent it takes to become Americaâ€™s Next Drag Superstarâ€ in season 18.
