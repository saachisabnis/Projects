Are you ready to drive all night? Because Charli XCX wants you to perform the Apple dance so hard your little arms fall off. So far, the Charli XCX and Troye Sivan Sweat Tour is off to a steamy start. When Charli’s song “Apple” plays, a camera cuts to an “Apple girl” in the crowd doing the TikTok-famous Apple dance in the pit. Most famously, at Madison Square Garden, Charli and Sivan brought out Addison Rae and Lorde, yes, but also Kelley Heyer, the originator of the dance. She started performing and got interrupted, but she still powered through. “Thank you, Kelley,” Charli sang, through immense Auto-Tune.
Thank you, Kelley, indeed. There hasn’t been a bigger dance trend on TikTok this year — it’s a simple, easy-to-learn routine that looks equally good when you’re cute and sober or sloppy and drunk. How brat! Below, we’ve compiled the dancers from every city so far on the tour, from Heyer at MSG to the award-worthy performance in Atlanta to the post-modern “reinterpretation” that occurred in Denver to another Apple-crasher pulling focus from Brittany Broski in Los Angeles. Watch these on your way to the airport, the airport, the airport.
anyways i love you @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan #sweattour #charlixcx #troyesivan #fyp #viral #appledance #apple #applecharli #applecharlixcx #dance #fypシ゚viral #abcxyz 
Detroit kicked off the tour, meaning the audience got to be the true guinea pigs. The result? A delightfully frightened girl doing the Apple dance with a smile smeared on her face while her eyes belied a deep-seated fear. We stan. Yes, she forgot the moves, kinda, but she had a passion few will ever truly experience.
got to apple with my girls on the big screen last night 😭 shoutout & dc to the apple queen @Kelley Heyer u are an icon ! 💚 charli baby i love u <3 @Charli XCX #charlixcx #sweattour 
Montreal got to see the first influencer Apple dance of the tour when TikTok icon and Charli superfan @grapejuicenads (also known as just Nadia) performed the dance with her friends. She had chutzpah, she had ferocity, and she had the choreo down cold.
wait guys… i look so beautiful and i don’t normally say that pic.twitter.com/CS89Y9s3mF
In Toronto, the dance centered around a superstar gay in chaps and a Rush T-shirt doing the dance perfectly. Then the camera panned out and revealed someone had brought their little daughter to the show and she wanted to slay too. But Sammy, the Rush-er, really was great.
yall i was nervous dont judge me but we got picked for APPLE DANCE COLUMBUS OHIO!!! APPLE GIRLS @bri miller #sweattour #charlixcx #brat #troyesivan #appledance @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan 
Columbus gave one of the more chill Apple dances thus far on the tour. The girls did the dance and looked like they had fun. Good for these queens!
Big screen POV 🍏💚 Love you #sweattour @Charli XCX Video from @themification 🫶 #appledance 
New York got the mother lode of mothers, which included Heyer, creator of the dance. Unfortunately, another girl near her got a little too excited and tried to get onscreen with Heyer. Like a pro, Heyer just performed her way through it, showed off her Brat underwear, and made a video the next morning encouraging people not to dox that girl. 2024!
last night’s apple girl!!! 🍏✨🪩 @Charli XCX #apple #brat #sweat #charlixcx #philly #wellsfargo #sweattour #dance #fyp 
The Philadelphia Apple girl was like an Apple dance sniper — she got in, she did the job, she got out. No drama, no shenanigans, just Brat T-shirts and strong knowledge of the choreo.
Someone find her!!! @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan #apple #appledance #sweat #sweattour #charlixcx #troyesivan #baltimore #cfgbankarena #brat #bratsummer #rush #fyp 
Baltimore gave us the platonic ideal of Apple girls doing the Apple dance: well performed, a little personality, no drama. We are particularly into the Apple boy on the left’s “homemade cult classic” shirt.

Look, Troye Sivan’s music makes up half this tour, so it was inevitable that a trendy twink would be emboldened. This is their space, and we have to let them take the center sometimes. In Boston, one such attendee, in a crop top and sunglasses, natch, got called a “cutie” by Charli before doing a quite blasé version of the Apple dance. Yeah, it’s cute, but if you live in Boston, please keep an eye out for any feral and jealous BoCo twinks for the next few months.
Apple girl Chicago you will always be famous @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan #sweattour #sweat #brat 
Charli deemed this one, through Auto-Tune, “the cutest shit evah.” We are inclined to agree.
we loved being bre’s backup dancers 💚🍏 #appledance #sweattour #charlixcx #nashville 
The main Nashville girl doesn’t necessarily appear to be an expert at the Apple dance, but she has a certain “drunk and tattooed” quality to her that means she’s an expert on “being brat.”
#sweattour #apple #charlixcx #toryesivan #brat #atlanta 
To nobody’s surprise, Atlanta killed it. Give this performance its 10s, nobody’s topping this. The choreography? Perfect. The interpretation? Inspired. The vibes? Immaculate. Go off.
Soooo cutieee 🍏⭐️🕺 @Charli XCX #miamiapple #miamiappledance #charlixcx #sweattourmiami #miamisweattour #appledance #miami #fortlauderdale #foryoupage #fyp #sweattourcharlixcx 
Rather than focus on one specific person, Miami had a broader, more community-focused Apple dance. Five people shared the spotlight and nobody pulled more attention than the rest. Marxist win!

What we love most about this dancer is the 2010s hipster glasses — a reminder that Charli’s indie-sleaze revival also means that big, wide frames are coming back soon.
We were all doing it in the crowd though so it was okay. Charli XCX apple dance in Dallas at Sweat Tour concert  #dallas #brat #charlixcx #concert #troyesivan #tour #sweat #sweattour #appledance @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan 
Well, this is awkward. The Apple dance did not happen in Dallas, though whether it was because of a technical malfunction, a human malfunction, or something else occurring is currently unclear. Charli seemed surprised by it, at least. Sorry to this city.
“I love a slight reinterpretation of the apple dance thats pretty sexy sometimes” 💀 😭💚🍏 #charlixcx #apple #sweattour #brat #denver
Somewhere along the way, the Sweat Tour started to get post-modern with the Apple dance. Charli herself referred to the Denver performance as a “slight reinterpretation of the Apple dance” after it finished. Okay, so the moves were largely wrong, but the creative spirit is definitely right.
Phoenix apples are just better 🤩🍏 @Charli XCX @Troye Sivan #sweattour #sweattourphoenix #charlixcx #troyesivan #apple #appledance 
The Phoenix Apple-dance dancer crammed a lot of performance in. Before it even began in earnest, there was an assless-chaps reveal, with red, zebra boxers. The dance itself went well too. This was a professional.
my friends n i were the apple girls :’) pinch meeee #apple #applecam #charlixcx #brat #appledance #sweattour 
Kesha and Tate McRae showed up to the L.A. Sweat Tour on night one, which is maybe why no great-quality videos have been posted of the Apple dance. Added pop stars pull focus! Still, from what we can see, this was a well-performed, juicy Apple dance.
Night 2 Apple Dance in LA! #SWEATTOUR #appledance #charlixcx #troyesivan #crazy 
The Apple dancers on night two in Los Angeles stayed committed to their energetic performance as a man came up and shouldered his way into the group, sending Brittany Broski off camera. If we had a nickel for every time someone went viral for crashing an Apple dance, we’d have two nickels — which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.
