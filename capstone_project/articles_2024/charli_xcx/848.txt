Harry Styles hasn’t released a record since 2022’s Grammy-winning Album of the Year, Harry’s House, and he wrapped up his Love On Tour jaunt two years ago. But the pop superstar is still clearly on the minds of his dedicated fans. Styles was just named as People magazine’s 2024 Sexiest Musician Alive as selected by their Readers’ Choice Poll. With almost 350,000 votes cast, the magazine claims it was the “most fiercely contested Sexist Man Alive readers’ choice poll yet.” Styles was in the running along with Shaboozey, Zach Bryan, and Role Model, who embarked on a large-scale TikTok campaign for the title. “Harry Styles already knows victory tastes sweet (after all, he’s won in this category multiple times before) but this year it was even more delicious,” People wrote. While Joe Jonas didn’t win Sexiest Musician, the Grammy-nominated musician was named “Makes BRAT Look Sexiest,” due to his “sassy social media presence, cheeky attitude and take on Charli XCX’s ‘Apple’ dance.” (Billboard)
