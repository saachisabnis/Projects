SAVE $39.96: As of Dec. 17, get a pair of Beats Studio Buds+ for $129.99 at Amazon. That's a discount of 24%.  
Trying to find a last-minute gift that's perfect for just about anyone on your holiday list? Why not get a pair of earbuds? Anyone can appreciate music, or if they're more into podcasts, they can enjoy their favorite on the go with a great pair of buds. They can also be used for taking calls or jumping on calls or meetings at work. And there's a great brand that's on offer right now thanks to Amazon.
As of December 17, get a pair of transparent Beats Studio Buds+ for just $129.99 at Amazon. That's $39.96 off their usual price of $169.96 and a discount of 24%.
These earbuds are a great alternative to Apple AirPods, given that Beats is part of the Apple ecosystem. And you can't deny how cool they look with their transparent design, a decision that obviously more tech companies should decide to undertake again like it's the 2000s. 
But on the tech side, these earbuds sound fantastic, whether you use them listen to Charli XCX or you log in to a Zoom call with them. They offer active noise cancelling and transparency modes for a custom listening experience, so you can block out the world or let the things in that matter. You also get up to 36 hours of listening time per charge, which means you can go all day and night pumping out the jams or even talking on the phone. 
For the price, you're getting a stellar pair of headphones. But given how close the holidays are, you'll probably want to pick them up now instead of later to lock this price in.
