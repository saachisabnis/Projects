Italian greyhounds are lean, agile, and shockingly fast on their feet. Originally bred as hunting dogs and companions for the elite, these athletic animals have also earned renown for their incredible racing skills. But Italian greyhounds aren't just the rulers of the racetrack - they kill it on the catwalk, too!
Italian greyhounds have the classic "lean and lanky" supermodel build, so it's not exactly shocking that they can pull off some fashionable threads - especially glamorous greyhounds Cindy, Claudia, and Twiggy Iggy. Forget about your Versaces and your Guccis, the Iggy family is the true first family of fashion!
This glamorous trio from @theiggyfamily is serving "hound couture," and I am here for it. These super-stylish Italian greyhounds (along with their older brother Winston) have gained a big following on TikTok for their impeccable fashion sense, bold outfits, and their innate ability to "work angles" on camera (paging Charli XCX...).

Whether they're rocking furry multi-colored ponchos, sophisiticated fleece turtlenecks, or fabulous sequined capes, these glammed-up greyhounds look like they'd be right at home on the cover of Vogue. With their powerful "lewks" and adoring social media following, I'd say these dogs are well on their way to joining the likes of Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell as true fashion icons! To quote TikTok commenter @lylx4, 'They are more glamorous than me and anyone I know."
The adorable Iggy family may have the rapt attention of thousands of adoring social media fans, but they're not the only Italian greyhounds to build a following for their fashion. Perhaps the best example is Tika, a 13-year-old greyhound from Montreal, Canada. Thanks to her bold wardrobe of avant-garde outfits, Tika has built up an enormous following of over a million on Instagram as @tikatheiggy, and even got her own favorable write-upÂ in the January 2021 issue of Vogue!
Even as a senior dog at the ripe old age of 13, Tika is still slaying the fashion game and posting the receipts for her followers on Instagram. In 2024 alone, she's met celebs like John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, rolled up to New York Fashion Week in cutting-edge threads, and even got to flaunt her fashion onstage at Dolly Parton's first-ever "Pet Gala" in Nashville!
Tika might have blazed the trail for Italian greyhounds as internet style icons, but new generations of glamorous greyhounds will follow in her pawprints. Claudia, Cindy, Winston, and Twiggy Iggy are out here proving to the world (or at least TikTok) that furry fashionistas aren't just a fluke!
