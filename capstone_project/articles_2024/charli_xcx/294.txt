	Kids love to push parents out of our comfort zones, and while we may act embarrassed, we (sometimes) actually love it. Take Kim Kardashian for example, whose been open about her dislike of dancing throughout the years. But she just admitted that she actually enjoys one dance that 11-year-old daughter North West “forced” her to do, and we can’t stop laughing at their cute photos.

	










	“I might enjoy the forced tik tok dances a litttttttle bit 😉,” the SKIMS founder captioned a post on Instagram, admitting to actually liking the fun and silly Tik Tok dances she does with her daughter on their joint TikTok account. (If you’ve watched Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, then you know how big of a deal this is for Kardashian!)

	The photos show a behind-the-scenes look of one of their TikToks, where they dance in a sped-up video to “Apple” by Charli XCX and make each other laugh. Kardashian wore tan flare pants with a yellow bandana-shaped top and North had on a fuzzy hat with a sweater vest, baggy shorts, and sneakers. The carousel of photos include a photo of North and Kardashian smiling at a draft of their TikTok, a picture of North posing while Kardashian gives her a look, a photo of Kardashian posing while North looks at her nails, and a video of their dance. The Kardashians star definitely seems happy spending time with her eldest daughter, even if they are dancing!



	“I love seeing her in her mom mode,” one person commented. “I love how much fun they have together,” someone else said.

	Others commented on how much North looks like her dad Kanye West. “The way she is her dad’s daughter bruh. She got that whole man’s everythingggggg down to his postures and traits,” one person said. Another joked, “I just know Kim has said ‘you look like yo damn daddy’ more than once 😂😂😂”

	Kardashian shares North and kids Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5, with West. In the past, they’ve publicly disagreed over their kids’ use of TikTok, with West once claiming that North was on TikTok “against my will.”


	In a June 2023 cover story for TIME, the American Horror Story: Delicate star addressed controversy over North rapping along to inappropriate lyrics on a song, which West noticed and called her out on. “As soon as I saw the words, I was like, ‘Oh no, we’re taking this down,’” she told the outlet. “I saw on the internet, [people saying] ‘Kanye was right,’ and maybe he was in that instance.”

	At the same time, Kardashian has safety measures in place, like disabled comments and only having the app on her phone so North has to ask her to look at it. “But she loves making slime videos and doing her little hair tutorials, and I will fight for her to be creative,” Kardashian added.

	These things may have started out as safety measures, but they turned into a really cool bonding opportunity for Kardashian and North. You love to see it!
