	Music legend Cher announced that she will be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. 

	“I have followed Kamala Harris since she was my U.S. senator,” said Cher in a video clip posted to social media on Friday. “She fought for me then and she is fighting for all of us now.”

	She added she would be “proudly voting” for Harris and Walz, adding, “I know they will fight to protect our rights and I’m so grateful to be able to make my voice count this year. I hope you will too.”

	Cher was among the celebrities who weighed in on President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race in July. The singer expressed that she was among those conflicted, adding that while she “loved” Biden, she also recognized he was unlikely to defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump in November. “In my heart I’m tortured, because I don’t believe the Democrats can win the Presidency with ‘Pres Biden’ ‘Joe’ whom I’ve loved since we met in 2008,” Cher wrote in a post at the time. “I campaigned for him I believe it’s time to pass the baton, time for dems to think ‘way’ outside the box. Maybe even a split ticket.”
