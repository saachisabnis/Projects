I need a dictionary to decode all of these
Right, after literally the most agonising wait ever, Spotify Wrapped 2024 is finally upon us, alongside a whole host of weird genres. Here I am thinking I just listened to Pop and Musical Theatre soundtracks when all of a sudden my Spotify Wrapped 2024 is telling me my top genres are Guaracha and Shoegaze.
There are over 1500 genres on Spotify with many more being added every day, so let’s have a look at what some of the weirdest ones that might have ended up in your Wrapped actually mean.
One of the new genres for 2024, what the After Hours Football Rap genre actually has to do with football isn’t all that clear. But think of the music from the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Sexxy Red, and Peso Pluma and you’ve found your vibe.
If Karol G, Bad Bunny and Maluma were some of your top artists on your Spotify Wrapped 2024 list then this might be one of your most listened to genres. Think of hot summer nights on the beach, preferably with a pina colada in hand.
This is probably the most buzzword genre I’ve ever seen and it’s exactly what you think it is. if, like all of us, you’ve been listening to the likes of Chappell Roan, Lana Del Rey, Charli xcx and Sabrina Carpenter on repeat whilst wearing a very aesthetic pink pilates outfit then this is the genre for you. It’s all I’ve ever wanted to be and more.
According to Spotify, Alt Z is described as: “Alt pop with story-full lyrics that theatre kids are likely to love.” Think of artists like FINNEAS, King Princess and Julia Michaels. Given my love for a musical theatre bop, it makes sense this genre crops up on my Wrapped every year.
Spotify classifies this genre as: “A subset of New York drill that emphasises distortion and long, clean 808 notes.”
Hyperpop is defined as: “Exaggerated take on popular music styles integrates avant-garde innovations while also drawing from electronic, hip-hop, and dance.” If you listen to a lot of 100 gecs, ElyOtto, glaive and Ericdoa then this might be one of your most listened to genres.
Mellow Gold might sound like a weird way to talk about urine but I promise you it’s not related to that at all. Spotify’s definition of this genre states: “Mellow Gold contains elements of soft rock and folk rock, with emphasis on clean production, harmonies, and melodic compositions.”
If relaxing with any light but the big light on whilst listening to The Eagles, Carly Simon or The Doobie Brothers has been something you’ve been doing a lot in 2024 then Mellow Gold is your kinda vibe.
Whilst Spotify hasn’t provided a specific definition for Goblincore, think of cottagecore, woodsy and overall cosy vibes – if you’ve ever listened to Noah Kahan or Liana Flores then you’re a Goblincore stan through and through.
Shoegaze is defined by Spotify as: “A subgenre of indie and alternative rock characterized by its ethereal mixture of obscured vocals and guitar distortion.”
