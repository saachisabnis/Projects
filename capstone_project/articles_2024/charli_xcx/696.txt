Charli XCX, Troye Sivan, and their brat pack ate it up at the Sweat Tour at MSG. In the words of Stefon, this place had everything: fluffy tutus, girlies working it out on the remix, and probably some (alleged) molly sprinkled in there. One of the big surprises of the night was Lorde strutting onstage with Charli to sing the “Girl, So Confusing” remix. It was highly anticipated — I mean, selling out MSG is a big deal, so it makes sense to bring out the collab of the summer on a Monday night as a sweet treat for dessert. But the real surprise was what came before it; after all, a drink comes before the meal. Addison Rae popped in to debut her song “Diet Pepsi” live. Not to mention, she slipped in a scream for the “Von Dutch” remix with AG Cook. How’s that for a full-course dinner?
