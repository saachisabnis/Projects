"Look at all the women in here. Let them know that you care about them and fucking give a fuck about them, Jesus Christ"
Billie Eilish encouraged her fans to vote for Kamala Harris at a recent Atlanta show ahead of this week’s US presidential election.
The pop sensation is currently on the North American leg of her ‘Hit Me Hard And Soft’ world tour to celebrate her third album of the same name. Yesterday (November 3) at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, Eilish took time out of her set to remind the audience to vote, urging them get behind the current Vice President.
“Times are really scary and a lot is at stake. I know that if you’re in this room and you support me, you support women and I hope that you will vote for Kamala Harris,” the 22-year-old said in a TikTok video uploaded by the US Democratic Party.
In another video, she continued: “Look at all the women in here. Let them know that you care about them and fucking give a fuck about them, Jesus Christ. I’m not going to keep going but I just really implore you to get out there and vote because it really, really matters. This is really such an important time for us.”
this is your sign to vote!

Eilish has endorsed Harris before. Back in September, she and her brother Finneas shared a video to promote National Voter Registration Day and revealed that they would be voting for the Democratic candidate and her running mate, Tim Waltz, “because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy.”
After the endorsement, Harris’ campaign released an ad that featured Eilish’s 2018 single ‘When the Party’s Over’, highlighting the negative impact of Roe v. Wade’s reversal on reproductive rights across the US.
Last month, Eilish said in an interview that she would “feel safe as a woman” in America if Harris was elected, adding that the upcoming vote is “the most important election of our time”.
Tomorrow (November 5) is National Voters Day in the US, where Americans will vote between Harris or the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, to be the 47th President of the United States.
Other notable figures who have endorsed Harris include Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, Madonna, St. Vincent, Beyoncé, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Quavo, Bad Bunny and more. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry will also headline the final pre-election rally of Harris’ campaign today (November 4).
In other news, Rihanna said she’d love to collaborate with Eilish in a recent interview, and Eilish responded via Instagram, saying, “What in the absolute fuck oh my god what the fuck”.
Eilish’s next stop on the ‘Hit Me Hard and Soft’ tour will be in Nashville, Tennessee at the Bridgestone Arena this Wednesday (November 6). You can find any available tickets here and click here for the rest of the tour details.
