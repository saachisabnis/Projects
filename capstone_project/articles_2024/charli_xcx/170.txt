Dua Lipa caught a Billboard Music Award before it went “Houdini.”

	During Thursday night’s telecast of the annual show, Lipa took home the Top Dance/Electronic Song trophy for her work on “Houdini,” which spent 17 weeks atop the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart.

	Accepting her award via video, the “Training Season” singer offered a message of support to her dedicated followers for their continued support. “This is so cool, thank you so much. Thank you for all the love and the support and for dancing with me to ‘Houdini.’ It means the world to me,” she said in the clip. “I’m so sorry I can’t be there with you guys tonight. I am currently on tour in Asia doing the Radical Optimism tour, but I’ll be in a city close to you very soon, so come down, let’s carry on dancing.”

	Lipa’s win came out of some fierce competition in the category, where the singer squared off against fellow finalists Ariana Grande (“Yes, And?”), Kenya Grace (“Strangers”), Marshmello & Kane Brown’ (“Miles on It) and even herself (for her other Radical Optimism single, “Illusion.”) Along with Top Dance/Electronic Song, Lipa was also a finalist in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist category, alongside stars like Charli XCX, Beyoncé, Calvin Harris and the Chainsmokers. 

	










	Zach Bryan led the finalists at the 2024 BBMAs with a whopping 21 entries across 18 different  categories. He’s followed by Taylor Swift who earned 17 total entries in 16 categories at the annual show, potentially adding to her record as the most awarded woman in the history of the BBMAs.
