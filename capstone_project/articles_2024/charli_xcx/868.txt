Right off the bat of his “Sweat” tour in North America, GRAMMY-nominated singer Troye Sivan is now preparing to take on a new role at Smirnoff as its first-ever “Chief Vibes Officer.”
Although an unconventional – and admittedly, not a real role but merely for promotional purposes – the multi-year partnership is still a match made in heaven for Sivan. Having spent the most part of the year reveling on stages alongside brat artist Charli xcx, the singer will channel his free-spirited attitude to advocating for the vodka brand’s wider “We Do We” campaign which focuses on getting people out and forming social connections. 
Sharing how he hopes to bring the movement to life, Sivan says he will be encouraging fans to “Go OFF” by “bringing people together and being ourselves.” In a similar sentiment, Senior Vice President for Vodkas Stephanie Jacoby adds, “We knew from the moment we first spoke to Troye that this was going to be something truly special – we share a passion for fun, for bringing people together and for not taking ourselves too seriously.”
