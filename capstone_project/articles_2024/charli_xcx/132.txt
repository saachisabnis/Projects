It's giving Carrie in 'And Just Like That'
We've got the strawberries and cream in the fridge, the tennis is on the tv and we're literally doing our best impression of Kirsten Dunst in the *iconic* noughties rom-com Wimbledon. 
And as sports go, Wimbledon is seriously serving when it comes to fashion - whether it's Margot Robbie rocking polka dots, Charli XCX giving it bratitude or Zendaya giving major Tashi Duncan vibes in Ralph Lauren. 
The latest celeb proving that the best fashion is court-side? None other than Anya Taylor-Joy! The actress and fashionista has already been having a fab summer (we caught our girl living it up at Glasto with Cara Delevingne!) and now she's stunting at the tennis. 
Outfit-wise, she rocked a plunging, nude halter neck top which featured a cleavage-exposing cutout and a BDSM-lite black leather belt fastening at the neck. She paired the statement top with a black mini skirt featuring a bow embellishment and accessorised with rimless, oval sunglasses and a pair of stiletto high heels. 
But there was one detail of this outfit which *really* took it the next level: Anya's choice of bag. 
At first glance, it looked like the actress had taken her pet bird along to watch the tennis but, on closer inspection, we can tell you that she was wearing a canary clutch by none other than JW Anderson. 
And if you know your SATC lore, you'll be aware that Anya isn't the first one to fall for this quirky choice of clutch: Carrie Bradshaw rocked a similar, pigeon-themed bag by the same brand in the second season of And Just Like That.
Well, if it's good enough for Anya and Carrie, it's good enough for us!
