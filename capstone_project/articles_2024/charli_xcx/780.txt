Quite possibly her most naked look of all time 
Whoever said it girls were over clearly hasn't heard about Addison Rae. 
Swiftly changing from TikTok teen to avant pop girly, her transformation is one for the history books. Now she's signed to Columbia Records (*stream 'Diet Pepsi'!!*), hanging with all our fave models and partying in true Brat summer style.
There's also the fact that the singer, model, dancer, TikTok sensation and, seemingly, Charli XCX's BFF, has us perennially gagged with her killer style. Whether it's Madonna cosplay (not once, but twice) in a Jean Paul Gaultier-style cone bra, rocking a corset Roberto Cavalli naked dress, dancing on a car in a bejewelled bra or styling out the no-trousers trend with a sheer bodysuit, we are seriously obsessed.  
She's giving editorial, chic, elevated...you know the vibes. So much so that she's becoming a fave among high fashion magazine editors, recently gracing the summer issue of Interview Magazine in a topless photo shoot.
Now, she's stepped things up with a simply *unreal* cover shoot with Perfect Magazine. In this nearly-naked cover shot, Ms Addison is captured kneeling for the camera wearing a truly unusual 'bikini': a strategic spray tan, leaving her with dramatic bikini lines.
Almost naked in the shot, she's wearing a pair of makeshift pastel pink bikini bottoms, no top or bra and a jumper tied around her shoulders. 
Accessorising this barely-there look? A pair of white trainers, a black Coach handbag with a pretzel (?!) attached, and the cover line "Addison Rae is Full-Hot". 
We think that says it all...
