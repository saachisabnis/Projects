Lorde assisted Charli XCX on a remix of "Girl, So Confusing" off her new album Brat, and during a new interview with Billboard, Lorde spoke about her contribution after hearing Charli admit she was "super jealous" of her success with "Royals."
The singer confessed that her first reaction to the song was a “two-part thing of both deep empathy for my friend and this feeling of ‘Man, I’ve been misunderstood, and I really want to make it right.’”
“When I was writing this verse, I was saying these things to her for the first time,” Lorde continued. “There was such a rawness and an immediacy to what I was saying. I love that we truly did work it out on the remix. There’s something very brat about that, something very meta and modern. Only Charli could make that happen."
“She had opened up a channel between us, and it made me say things that I had never said," she added. "I was articulating things I’d never said or maybe even things I’ve never even heard said. This whole thing has been such a huge honor.”
The pop star's comments came in May during an interview with Rolling Stone. “When ‘Royals’ came out, I was super jealous of the success that that song got, and that Ella got,” Charli said at the time. “You piece all this stuff together in your brain, like: ‘She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick.’ You create these parallels and think, ‘Well, that could have been me.’ But it couldn’t have because we’re completely different people."
“I wasn’t making music that sounded anything like ‘Royals’,” she continued. “I think you just read what you want into it because you’re feeling insecure about your own work.”
