It’s a not-so-subtle bit of marketing. 
After the less-than-universally-acclaimed release of her single “Woman’s World” earlier this summer, it’d appear Katy Perry—she of “Teenage Dream,” American Idol, and Left Shark legend—is attempting a new strategy for going viral: She’s wearing a brand-new lower back tattoo in the shape of a QR code. (Is it a Charli XCX reference? Or just a Y2K throwback?)
I’ll be honest: It took me several tries to get my phone camera to properly scan the fake tattoo, but it is indeed an eye-catching piece of marketing. The QR code links to a pre-save website for Katy’s upcoming studio album, 143, out September 20. (If your phone isn’t picking up on the QR code either, you can find the link it brings up here.) 
Whether you consider the QR code “genius,” “unserious,” or otherwise, the musician is, in fact, this year’s VMAs Video Vanguard Award winner. When asked about the honor on the red carpet tonight, Katy took the opportunity not to shout out the QR code or promote 143, but to say goodnight to her daughter, Daisy Dove, whom she shares with partner Orlando Bloom. “Hi, Daisy!” she called into the camera. “Don’t stay up too late, sweetheart!” 
When asked about how becoming a mother has impacted her music-making process, the celeb said, “I feel a sense of wholeness, more wholeness, and more grounded-ness. I’m writing songs from a place of really, truly empowered—feeling very connected to my feminine divine [energy]. It’s changed my whole life for the better.”
Couldn’t love her more if we tried!
