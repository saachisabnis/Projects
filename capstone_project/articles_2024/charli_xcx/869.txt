Fans are now speculating Lorde might feature on the upcoming project
Marina has teased new music after sharing a snippet of new material on social media.
On X/Twitter yesterday (August 10), the singer shared a three-second clip of an electronic track, along with a bullseye emoji. The same clip was then shared in an Instagram carousel alongside the caption: “You know I never miss. 🎯”
It left fans wondering what the significance of the emoji was, and if it may be a clue as to an album or song title.
Although little else was shared, she also seemingly confirmed the direction of her upcoming project, after pointedly liking one fan’s comment, which asked: “Are we finally getting our electro-dance pop moment?”

Others were also quick to note she included a picture of Lorde, who fans are now speculating might feature, particularly after her unexpected collaboration with fellow pop titan Charli XCX on ‘Girl, so confusing‘ recently.
Last month, the ‘Purge The Poison’ singer confirmed she was working on her sixth album, telling Attitude: “I am working on a new record, and I am loving it. It will definitely be out next year.” Marina also hinted at new music with a tweet that simply read: “album six.”
She also spoke about her poetry book Eat The World – which is set to be published on October 29 via Penguin Random House – saying: “I’m super excited about that. It’s something that’s a very different feel for me.”
At the time, she clarified that both were distinct projects that had nothing to do with each other, saying the book “exists on its own thing”.
She explained: “I can’t focus on more than one project at a time. It’s very difficult for me. I like committing fully, then moving on to the next thing. I’ll be doing some fun promo around it; lots of podcasts. There’s lots to talk about.”
Elsewhere, she reflected on what it was like to have Billie Eilish as a fan, and said she found it “flattering”, particularly when the “artist is amazing”.
