Florence Pugh dazzled in a glamorous white dress as she attended Netflix's BAFTAs 2024 afterparty at the Chiltern Firehouse, London on Sunday evening. 
The Dune star, 28, led the stars in attendance at the star-studded bash and was joined by the gorgeous Hannah Waddingham, 49, and Rosamund Pike, 45.
Florence exuded elegance in the semi-sheer lace dress and shielded her shoulders with a dramatic white feather boa.
As she arrived at the popular celebrity hotspot, where the afterparty was hosted, Florence turned heads in her stylish white gown.
She elevated her frame with strappy white high-heels and showed off her chest in the incredibly flattering, low-cut ensemble.
