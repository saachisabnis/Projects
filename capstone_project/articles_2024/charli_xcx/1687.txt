Brat summer just got a major dose of sexy.

 Jennifer Lopez isn't the only celeb embracing Brat summer. Bikini enthusiast Eva Longoria is the latest A-lister to share a video dancing to Charli XCX's viral hit "Apple." Wearing nothing but a tiny string bikini and a messy ponytail, the actress showed off her dance skills alongside friend Elsa Collins, an activist and the founder of The Ideateur, a sports, culture, and entertainment consulting group. Together, the two performed the instantly recognizable choreography, which has taken over social media and become the latest way for people to have a little fun and get in on the brat vibes that Ms. XCX has declared as the mood of the summer.

 "Latina BRATS for Kamala ✊🏽," Longoria captioned her clip, adding some not-so-subtle support for Kamala Harris, the vice president of the United States and presumptive Democratic nominee for this year's upcoming election. The Desperate Housewives alum's political activism isn't new. Back in 2020, she crisscrossed the country and urged the Latino community to come together and vote for Joe Biden.

 “I don’t know about you, but after all the attacks and the insults, I don’t just want Donald Trump out of office, but I want the Latino community to be the decisive group that votes him out of office,” she told voters in Kissimmee, Florida, according to the Texas Tribune. “I want to show our pride and our strength and our power as a community.”

 The New York Times reports that Harris "drew swift criticism from Latino elected officials and immigrant-rights leaders" because of a speech she delivered in 2021.

 “Do not come,” she said to migrants during a news conference in Guatemala. But now, Latinx groups and celebrities are rallying around Harris because of former President Donald J. Trump's proposed policies.

 Longoria co-founded the Latino Victory Fund in 2014, which works to elect "Hispanic Democratic candidates for local and national offices across the country."

 “I will tell you it’s not just that she lends her name or her fame to an issue,” Rep. Veronica Escobar, the first Latina to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, said of Longoria's political efforts. “It’s that she rolls up her sleeves and digs in.”
