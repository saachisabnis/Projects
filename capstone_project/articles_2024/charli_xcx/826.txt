Vice President Kamala Harris has picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate, turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state.
LOS ANGELES - Jeremy Green Eche, a 36-year-old trademark lawyer from Brooklyn, bought the website HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020 when Kamala Harris was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, the Associated Press reported. 
Now, with Harris having chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, Eche stands to gain significantly. He is ready to sell the domain, along with over a dozen other Harris-related websites, for $15,000.
Eche, who was known as Jeremy Peter Green before he got married, is a cyber squatter. Cyber squatting, also called domain investing, involves buying domains with someone else’s name or brand, hoping to sell them for a profit later. Eche's history includes purchasing ClintonKaine.com in 2011, five years before Hillary Clinton chose Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. After Clinton's selection, Eche offered the domain to her campaign, but they declined. Instead, he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing firm that used it for anti-Clinton content, funded by the Trump campaign.
Eche owns at least 15 domains related to Harris and her potential vice-presidential picks. This portfolio includes HarrisPritzker.com, HarrisEvers.com (for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers), HarrisFetterman.com (for Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman), HarrisWarnock.com (for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock), and HarrisPeters.com (for Michigan Sen. Gary Peters). Additionally, he holds several domains for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, anticipating a potential 2028 presidential run.
Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states. She will introduce Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.
Currently, HarrisWalz.com features a minimalistic design with Gov. Walz's name in lowercase black letters on a chartreuse background. This design choice is a nod to artist Charli XCX's tweet calling Harris a "brat" after President Joe Biden ended his campaign. The site links to Eche's startup, Communer, a platform for buying and selling domains and trademarks, where he lists the Harris domains for $15,000.
Eche has not yet been contacted by the Harris campaign, though he remains hopeful. Reflecting on his 2016 experience with the Clinton campaign, he said, "Hopefully Harris' people are more savvy than Clinton’s people were." Despite supporting Harris, Eche is prepared to sell the domains to any buyer, stating, "The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them."
A Harris spokesperson did not immediately respond to inquiries about their plans to purchase the domains.
