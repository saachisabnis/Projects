Emma Kumano-Maloney is a fourth-year Sociology and English major from West Chester, PA. She is passionate about music, arts, and all things creative. In college, she made the inevitable shift from classical music monster (18 years of viola) to hyperpop princess (Charli XCX and Rina Sayawana), and is currently in a love triangle between Adobe InDesign and Canva Premium. For the past three years, Emma has been the media head for Sequence Magazine, Grinnellâ€™s premier comic and Arts magazine. She is excited to expand her artistic storytelling, and she hopes to keep the community entertained and up to date on the artistic happenings of Grinnell.
