The Co-op Live music venue has many famous artists scheduled to appear over the next few weeks.
On Saturday, May 25, Nicki Minaj disappointed 20,000 fans in the Manchester Venue when her show was cancelled due to the star's detainment at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.
In a statement issued at the time, an arena spokesman said: "Despite Nicki’s best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight’s show happen, the events of today have made it impossible. We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused."

Fans were let into the Co-op Live Arena for her show at around 7pm on Saturday, before the promoter Live Nation announced at around 9.40pm that it would be postponed.
With fans in turmoil over the rescheduled event, there are still many acts set to perform at the venue, including Eagles, who are on their farewell tour and have multiple nights booked there.
