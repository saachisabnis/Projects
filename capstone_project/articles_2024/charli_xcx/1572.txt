Good Luck, Babe! makes it to both ROTY and SOTY or just SOTY
this era is giving reputation + Lover. 

Accurate. TTPD doesn’t have that inescapable pop anthem. Not counting Cruel Summer since its success was years after the album’s run
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
I know that most people are expecting Billie to win  AOTY again like a sure thing, but is it really that undeniable?
This year is shapping up to be a stacked pop album line up, with Billie, Taylor, Ariana, Sabrina, maybe Charli and maybe Chappel in the mix for AOTY nominations. Can Billie win that easily with so many pop artists splitting votes?
Don’t get me wrong, I also think that she is the frontrunner, but her losing for a veteran with support from other fields wouldn’t shock me at all
I guess her strenght comes from the alternative and  maybe rock field support, but, if an album like Only God Was Above Us gets nominated, would she still be undeniable?
Billie is not undeniable. At this point, trying to declare a frontrunner without knowing if the Sabrina album is good or not is pretty pointless.
I mention Sabrina specifically because the Grammys love coronating young female singers across the board in their breakout year. You could probably make the same argument in favor of Chappell Roan as well.

I mean, I agree with you about Billie, despite what Im seeing around on other forums and reddit
That said, I really don’t see Sabrina winning AOTY, even if her album is good. She is giving Olivia Rodrigo teas at best
Sabrina’s album won’t even be acclaimed let’s bfr
 When the US actually sends troops into combat, and our own soldiers begin taking lives, I’ll place blame. Until then, all we can offer is diplomacy. We’ve provided aid to both sides of the conflict. A ceasefire agreement was rejected by Hamas literally this month. The terrorist organization is insisting on this war (that they started on October 7th) continuing. It’s hard to help a region whose leadership doesn’t want to be helped, sadly. Ok, that’s all I will say. But I felt context was needed. There’s a lot of half-truths and misinformation about that war, and I know we have several Jewish people on these boards who probably feel their side isn’t getting fair representation. I know friends who have family in Israel who feel attacked by the online discourse but are afraid of publicly saying anything. ANYWAY… Fortnight is probably getting in ROTY, but not SOTY. Gooch is wrong, Chappell Roan is getting in AOTY. The Kamala “brat” bump is probably going to be forgotten by the time Taylor endorses the campaign in the fall. I’m tempted to blindly put “Short N Sweet” at the top of my AOTY predictions, despite having not heard it. And I’m tempted to put Pearl Jam over Vampire Weekend in my predictions. 
I think everyone knows that Israel is the one who rejected the ceasefire. Bare in mind that their parliament just voted and rejected the two state solution last week, completely denied the existence of Palestine. I swear Zionist always twisting fact but we are not fool. Anyway, I hope Macklemore wins Best Songs for Social Change.
Sexy, confident. So intelligent.
She is heaven-sent. So soft, so strong.
These news channels explaining Brat are cracking me up, crazy how it’s having this kind of impact and still will probably get snubbed from AOTY.

Nah nah nah, let’s be clear that both sides are delaying the negotiations. Hamas rejected the initial proposal for the 6-phase plan. I admit I completely missed the story about Israel’s parliament (bear with me, I’m dealing with a death in the family. I missed that story amidst all the Trump shooting/Biden drop out hysteria last week.) So I’m going to drop this, as no one ever wants a nuanced discussion. To be clear, a two-state solution (followed by UN membership for Palestine) is the only way forward.
But I’ll stand firm and say Macklemore is an antisemite based on that Jew costume he wore a long time ago. If we’re going to correctly call out Kanye’s antisemitism, Morgan Wallen’s racism and Dave Chappelle’s transphobia, Macklemore gets no free pass for the Jew nose either. Too bad too, cuz Hind’s Hall was actually pretty fire, but fuck him.

Whatever Gucci says, we all need to collectively say, “We disagree. Pure Delusion. Get Real.” 
The amount of times we see it and the amounts of time they are WRONGGGGG
I am by no means a Taylor Swift fan, but in no way is this accurate. Plenty of songs have decreased by over a 1,000 spins in a week. Plus all this means is her label asked radio to stop playing the song in favor of pushing the next single “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” which increases by 2,039 spins this week.
Checking Mediabase’s Top 40 chart now, it lists the “Fortnight” as decreasing by 5,896 spins… now THAT might be the biggest drop I’ve ever seen. But once again… it’s all the label’s doing.
Also on the same chart, Djo’s “End of Beginning” is decreasing by 1,983 spins… proving that it’s not a first or abnormal thing. 
I don’t think labels can exactly ask radio program directors to stop playing a song. The directors retain songs that audience don’t switch channels over.
A major label’s advantage is access to these directors for getting a song into the radio’s playlist. However, labels commonly pay directors to spin specific tracks irrespective of audience reaction…allegedly. 
So fluctuations like these suggest that the song was primarily carried by the alleged arrangement and few directors have justifications to spin it without, when the label moves on to another single.
I believe you’re correct by saying it’s not abnormal, every label uses “Payola”, this switch up was just more aggressive. 
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
Y’all I’m predicting Brat. The Brat Summer is a thing and now with the Kamala edits it will be even more viral in the US.
Unpopular opinion: I don’t get the BRAT appeal 🙈. Genuinely asking, could someone please explain to me what is good about the album?

Charli now smashing hard in the US, 4 songs on Spotify top 200. Brat is happening.
Honey, y’all know Gold Derby is obsessed with basic, mediocre white women.  Gucci also does NOT get the appeal of Brat.
