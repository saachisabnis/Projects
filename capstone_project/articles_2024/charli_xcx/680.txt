For better or worse, people had a lot of feelings about advertising this year.
Thanks to social media, advertisers can no longer launch their campaigns into a void, hoping their marketing investment later pays off in increased sales. Advertising is now a two-way street, and brands must be prepared at all times for consumer feedback.
Increasingly, that feedback is morphing into full-blown backlash at unprecedented levels. Whether it’s heightened tension in an election year, ongoing polarization, or anxiety around emerging technology, marketers are often wading into a heated environment when trying to reach consumers. 
Apple, Coca-Cola, Calvin Klein, and Bumble were among the brands that sparked emotion, criticism, and even outrage this past year.
