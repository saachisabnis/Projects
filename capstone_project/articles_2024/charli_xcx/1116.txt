In a current New York cover story feature piece on Charli XCX, the British pop superstar shared some interesting details about a future project that she is presently working on. After writer Brock Colyar quotes Charli describing how tired she is on the day of their interview, “Oyyyyy … ummmm … ugh. Yeah, sorry. I’m a little discombobulated this morning,” they revealed that Charli had a good reason to be exhausted with this juicy tidbit: “She spent last night in the studio working with Bon Iver and Danielle Haim and tells me she’s feeling dehydrated.”
Charli has previously collaborated with Danielle Haim on the Charli single “Warm,” though neither artist has worked with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver before. In addition to disclosing those thrilling potential musical collaborations, Charli also disclosed that she is working on a forthcoming film with Tony Award-nominated playwright Jeremy O. Harris, and teased a forthcoming new “full-length other project” that is “definitely in the bratosphere, so to speak.” (Pitchfork)
