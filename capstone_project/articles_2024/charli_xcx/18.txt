"Being a woman is so nuanced and complex all the time, let alone through the lens of a very male-focused industry," Charli said while accepting the Powerhouse Award.

Charli XCX debuted a new song, “So I”, dedicated to her friend and the late producer SOPHIE Wednesday night (March 6) at the 2024 Billboard Women In Music Awards held at YouTube Theater in Los Angeles.

	“This song is about a person who’s really, really special to me who’s no longer with us,” XCX announced ahead of the performance. “It’s called ‘So I.'”

	The spare, ultimately soaring ballad reflects on the famed creative partnership XCX had with the producer, who died in a fall during an accident in January 2021. “Always on my mind/ Every day, every night,” the song’s chorus goes. “Your star burned so bright/ Why did I push you away/ I was scared sometimes/ You had a power like a lightning strike.” 

	










	XCX and SOPHIE are credited with creating the influential electronic genre hyper-pop, along with producer A.G. Cook. (Read the complete lyrics to “So I”, which will be included on XCX’s forthcoming album BRAT, below.)

	After the performance, XCX accepted the Powerhouse Award, giving a candid, funny speech about the not-always-sexy realities of being a woman in music. 

	“I feel like so many women in this room have been asked, ‘What’s it like to be a woman in music?’ or ‘Do you feel like it’s getting better for women in music?'” she said. “And my answer to that … is ‘I don’t know,’ because being a woman is so nuanced and complex all the time, let alone through the lens of a very male-focused industry like the music industry.” 

	“Some of the things that I personally deal with on a daily basis as a woman are, I wake up sometimes and I feel so positive and confident and I’m like, ‘Hey, I look sick,'” she continued. “And on other days I’m like, ‘I hate my jawline. I wish I looked more like that beautiful woman, or I wish I was … like these beautiful woman, like these beautiful artists. I wish I was as successful as this artist; I wish I was as niche as this artist and it’s a f–king headf–k, you know?” 

	“And I know that we’re not supposed to stand on this stage and say that,” she went on. “I know we’re supposed to stand on this stage and say ‘I love every woman and we’re all supporting each other all the time and it’s epic.’ And you know what? On nights like tonight, we are. But it’s also really competitive and it’s really hard sometimes. And the media does that to us, labels do that to us, the narrative around being a women does that to us, and it’s really tricky. 

	










	“But it’s nights like this where we can all come together and we can not only celebrate the fact that we’re women, but the fact that we’re all really incredible artists making really incredible music each in our own different lane, being confident, doing our own thing, creating our own sounds and putting our artistry first.”

	Always on my mindEvery day, every nightYour star burned so brightWhy did I push you awayI was scared sometimesYou had a power like a lightning strikeWhen I’m onstage sometimes at nightSay that I’m singing these songs you left behindAnd I know you always saidIt’s OK to cryI can cry, I can cry, so I cry

	Wish I tried to pull you closerYou pushed me hardMade me focusYour words, brutal, loving, truthful, I was pushed too farYou’re a hero, and a human, trackwise, don’t I make excusesYou’d say come on, stay … and I’d say, “No I’m fine”

	Always on my mindEvery day every nightYour star burned so brightWhy did I push you awayI was scared sometimesYou had a power like a lightning strikeWhen I’m onstage sometimes at nightSay that I’m singing these song you left behindAnd I know you always said it’s OK to crySo I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

	Guilty feelings keep me fracturedGot a phone call after ChristmasDidn’t know how I should actI watched you burn so brightYour songs, your words, you’re goneUnless, when I make songs I remember things you’d suggest, make me feel … like this oneMaybe just a little bit

	Always on my mindEvery day every nightYour star burned so brightWhy did I push you awayI was scared sometimesYou had a power like a lightning strikeWhen I’m onstage sometimes at nightSay that I’m singing these song you left behindAnd I know you always said, it’s OK to crySo I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry
