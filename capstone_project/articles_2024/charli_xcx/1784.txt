Raye was the musical guest on last night’s episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by freshly robed five-timer Kristen Wiig. For her musical performances, Raye sang ornate, orchestral versions “Escapism.” and “Worth It.,” from her debut album, My 21st Century Blues. Watch her performances, and her SNL promo video with Kristen Wiig and Bowen Yang, below.
Raye released My 21st Century Blues in February of last year. While it’s technically her debut LP, the British singer-songwriter has written countless hits for other artists over the years, including six Top 20 hits in the United Kingdom and songs for Beyoncé and Charli XCX. She had a huge night at this year’s BRIT Awards in particular, winning six awards—the most ever for a single artist in a year—after her record-setting seven nominations.
