"Saving a life has never been so brat"
The American Heart Association has revealed that a few of Charli XCX’s ‘Brat‘ songs are the correct tempo for hands-only CPR.
The nonprofit – which works to fight heart disease within the United States – took to their official social media accounts to share that two of XCX’s tracks from her sixth studio album can be used while performing hands-only CPR on someone.
Both ‘Spring Breakers’ and ‘360’ are comprised of 120 beats per minute which is the correct tempo needed while performing CPR.
“It’s not #BratSummer unless you’re bumpin’ the beat of “360” by @charli_xcx to remember the tempo for Hands-Only CPR. If you see a teen or adult collapse, call 911 and push hard and fast in the center of the chest,” read one of their captions while another read: “We aren’t ready for brat summer to end! Thanks to @CharliXCX for the vibe and for this lifesaving beat.”

Fans took to the comments section to share their surprise. “Saving a life has never been so brat lol,” wrote one user while the social media team behind Beyond Meat wrote: “pumpin’ that, pumpin’ that 🫀,” changing the lyrics to XCX’s ‘360’ for something more appropriate.
Another XCX fan shared: “ah that’s what she meant when she said ‘i’m tectonic, moves, i make em, shock you like DEFIBRILLATORS’.”
The news of the ‘Brat’ songs being the correct tempo for hands-only CPR comes shortly after the ‘Guess’ singer officially declared an end to ‘Brat’ summer in a new post on social media yesterday (September 2).
‘Brat’ has been at the centre of its own cultural phenomenon since it was released back in June. Its simple lime green artwork became a meme, while fans on social media have embraced the record’s hedonistic aesthetic and attitude.
In the post, XCX wrote “goodbye forever brat summer and shared a series of clips on Instagram that show some of the key moments from ‘Brat’ summer, including the viral TikTok dance to ‘Apple’.

Last week, the singer teased a new remix on TikTok as she prepares to head into “Brat Autumn”. The new track appears to sample Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’ and would follow on from the Billie Eilish-featuring remix of ‘Guess’.
She has since teased that she has been working in the studio alongside the likes of Bon Iver and Danielle Haim, and that a “full-length other project,” is in the works but didn’t confirm if it would be a remix album. “But it’s definitely in the bratosphere, so to speak,” she said.
Charli has also been cast in upcoming film I Want Your Sex, directed by Gregg Araki in his first feature film in over a decade.
The ‘Brat’ pop star was added to the film’s main cast alongside Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman (Licorice Pizza), per Variety last Friday (August 30).
In a four-star review of ‘Brat’, NME wrote: “It all paints a picture of who XCX is in 2024. Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”.
“With ‘Brat’, XCX demonstrates that going her own way will always sound pretty good.”
