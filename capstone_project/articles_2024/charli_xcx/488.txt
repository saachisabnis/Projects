Nicole Kidman joined her husband, Keith Urban, on stage at the sold-out Concert for Carolina benefit show on Saturday, October 26, to celebrate his 57th birthday.
The actress, also 57, praised Urban for participating in the concert, telling the crowd at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina that he “wanted to be here with you” after fellow country star Eric Church gave him a call, according to a video from the event.
“I do wanna say, it’s his birthday tonight and he went, ‘The one thing I can do….'” Kidman told the crowd during her brief time on stage. Kidman kissed Urban before she and Church, 47, who coplanned the event with Luke Combs, sang “Happy Birthday” to the “Somebody Like You” singer.
Church stayed on stage for a duet with Urban after the birthday festivities — performing their 2013 duet “Raise ‘Em Up.”
When he initially introduced Urban to the stage, Church hailed him as a “guy I’ve always been able to count on,” who, “even before I ask the question, he just says ‘yes, and whose car are we taking?’”
The Concert for Carolina took shape after Combs, 34, a North Carolina native, vowed to do something to help those in his home state impacted by Hurricane Helene last month. The show also featured headliners James Taylor, Sheryl Crow, Billy Strings, Bailey Zimmerman and the Avett Brothers.
Over 83,000 concertgoers raised more than $24 million for hurricane relief efforts during the concert, which was hosted by Caleb Pressley and Marty Smith, and live streamed on Veeps and iHeartRadio.
The proceeds from the benefit were split between Combs and Church’s Chief Cares Foundation. Combs will reportedly send his portion to Samaritan’s Purse, Manna Food Bank, Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest NC and Eblen Charities.
“I love you, Carolina,” Urban said at the end of his set. “Thank you and God Bless you.”
“It was such an honor to be able to raise money for Hurricane Helene recovery,” Kidman wrote alongside a video on her Instagram Story Sunday, October 27. “Love you baby xx.”
Urban and Kidman have been through a tough time after the loss of Kidman’s mother, Janelle, who died last month at the age of 84.
“It’s been hard,” Kidman told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, October 23 at the Lioness season 2 premiere in Los Angeles. “It’s a hard road. I’m hanging in there.”
