Party girls unite! Charli XCX enlisted Kesha to perform their pair’s recent remix of “Spring Breakers” during the Sweat tour stop at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles last night. Kesha also performed her own hit, “Tik Tok,” during he show with Charli and Troye Sivan.

	Charli first hit the stage to perform her verse from the original version of “Spring Breakers,” before surprising the L.A crowd with Kesha, who was draped in a pink fur coat.

	After the concert, Kesha was spotted snapping photos and partying with Sivan and Charli at the pair’s Spotify-hosted Sweat Tour after-party. Lily-Rose Depp, Tove Lo, Fergie, Rachel Sennott, and Sasha and Malia Obama were also in attendance.

	










	Charli XCX and Kesha recently teamed up for a remix of “Spring Breakers,” a track of Charli’s hit album Brat. Unlike some other tracks on the singer’s remix LP, the new “Spring Breakers” remains sonically similar to the original, replacing Charli’s verses about blowing up the Grammys to make space for Kesha’s own lyrics, enhanced by an Animal-style autotune filter.

	The duo announced the single late on Sunday, sharing Brat-ty memes about their party girl reputations. Kesha reposted a screenshot of Charli calling a photo of her drinking topless in front of a sea of empty glasses and beer bottles, “brat.

	The new “Spring Breakers” remix comes just a few days after Charli released Brat and It’s Completely Different, which included reimagined versions of songs from the album, featuring artists such as Ariana Grande, Tinashe, the 1975, and Bon Iver. “Spring Breakers” is Kesha’s first release since “Joyride” in July.

	Charli XCX and Sivan are currently on their Sweat Tour, which hit Madison Square Garden in New York City last month. Rolling Stone wrote of the show, “Charli and Troye pulled out all the stops on a production that had even the most Brat-exhausted fans full-throttle bumpin’ that.”
