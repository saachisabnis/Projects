Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a former co-host of “The View,” slammed presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over her “lack of ability” Friday on “Hannity.”
Hasselbeck told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that “The View” is “not representing” the perspectives of America’s female voters, saying she doubts one person on the talk show’s panel would publicly admit to voting for 2024 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
The former “The View” co-host blasted the show as being “just part of a media swarm” that punishes conservative women. She tore into the media for propping up Harris as a relatable figure, pointing out that relatability does not neccessarily mean the vice president is capable of doing the job.
“The latest tactic of the media, and really everyone has to stay awake, is that they want to convince American voters that relatability is the equivalent of ability. And it’s not!” Hasselbeck told Hannity.
“You just talked about Kamala Harris supposedly eating a bag of Doritos, so emotionally charged after hearing this,” she continued. “That’s the commander-in-chief, potentially. That’s the emotional response of the leader of the world? To binge-eat a bag of Doritos? Are you kidding me?”
“Can you imagine Putin, how he deals with things, chugging down a bag of sour patch kids because he’s depressed about something not going his way? Or, back in the day, Soleimani binging on Funyuns? I doubt it. I doubt that’s the actual response of an elite leader whether you agree with what they’re leading or not. The relatability cloud that’s being dusted over Americans right now is only to hide that there’s a lack of ability. Kamala Harris failed at the border, so what do we want to do, give her the globe? Are you kidding me? I am just shocked,” Hasselbeck said. (RELATED: Tim Walz’s Dog Gets Media Interview Before Kamala Harris)
The Harris campaign sent out an email Friday asking for donations with an anecdote claiming the vice president “sat on the couch with a family-sized bag of Doritos” which she binge-ate upon discovering Trump won the 2016 election.

Harris has made several attempts to appear relatable to Gen Z voters, including trend-hopping on social media and celebrity guest stars. The vice president branded her campaign headquarters’s account in the green aesthetic of pop sensation Charli XCX’s sixth studio album, “brat,” in late July. She also featured musical guests such as Meghan Thee Stallion and Bon Iver at rallies.
Hasselbeck said it is a “big problem” that Harris has not taken a single adversarial question since she was “slotted in” to replace President Joe Biden, who endorsed her after dropping out of the race July 21.
“She was slotted in in, the most, like, I think unnerving moment for our democracy. And then now is denying that she’s part of the Biden economic problem. So, she wants to separate herself. Her only platform right now, and everyone’s like, ‘Get to know Kamala! Get to know Kamala!’ You can try, but she will change. She has a use ’em or lose ’em mentality — it’s awful,” Hasselbeck said.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
