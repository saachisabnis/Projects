Charli XCX and Yung Lean are joining the cast of the new movie Sacrifice, Deadline reports. The film, directed by Romain Gavras, also stars Chris Evans, Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek, Sam Richardson, Vincent Cassel, John Malkovich, Ambika Mod, Jade Croot, Jeremy O. Harris, and Miriam Silverman. Filming is underway in Greece and Bulgaria, according to Deadline.
Yung Lean, who was the subject of the 2020 documentary Yung Lean: In My Head, will be making his feature-film debut in Sacrifice. He released his latest album, the Bladee collaboration Psykos, in March.
Charli XCX has been doing a lot of acting, but most of her roles are in films and series that are not yet released. Beyond Sacrifice, she’s slated to appear in Faces of Death, I Want Your Sex, Erupcja, 100 Nights of Hero, and Overcompensating. Plus, she will be the host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live later this month.
Sacrifice is the first English-language movie from Romain Gavras. The Paris-born filmmaker has famously directed the music videos for Jamie xx’s “Gosh,” the Last Shadow Puppets’ “The Age of the Understatement,” Jay-Z and Kanye West’s “No Church in the Wild,” M.I.A.’s “Bad Girls” and “Born Free,” Justice’s “Stress,” and more.
