Will Charli XCX be featured on the next Britney Spears album? 
That seems to be the question on fan's minds after the "Boom Clap" star's latest interview with Andy Cohen on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Monday (May 6). Charli revealed that she was asked to write a few tracks for the potential album by the Princess of Pop's team, but is not sure if Spears was even involved in the process. 
“Britney then did this post where she was like, ‘I don’t have random people write for me.’ I was like, ‘OK, go off!’ So I don’t know that she was part of the process." She continued: 
“Her team was running before they could walk. Britney probably has a load of other projects that she’s focusing on. So I did get asked, but I don’t know if it’s, like, real.” The standout mentioned that she wrote some songs in hopes that they would be recorded by Spears, but they weren't. 
“Of course. I went to Malibu, and I wrote. You always write songs hoping Britney’s going to record them … but, you know, she didn’t record it.” The 31-year-old hitmaker told Cohen that it would be a dream to work with Britney Spears in the future.
The album, which has not been confirmed, would be Spear's 10th studio album following 2016's Glory. The "Oops!...I Did It Again" songstress has neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of another album.
