This section is always a grabbag of events and activities, a multi-genre arts smorgasbord we lovingly compile every season to cover those performances that aren’t quite one thing or another, and don’t quite fit within the confines of our other sections. It’s a mix of stand-up comedy, drag shows, dance parties, exhibits, readings, book and poetry readings, and a sampling of the many restaurants in Bethesda. And it adds up to a lot of additional offerings apart from our other categories of film, stage, dance, classical music and pop.
This fall, you could dust off your cowboy boots and dance with the DC Rawhides as they host their debut evening at Glen Echo Park. Or take in a reading of a queer author at D.C.’s newest bookstore, the LGBTQ-owned Little District Books. Or set your sights on a queer extravaganza put together to honor Hispanic Heritage Month at DC9. Or maybe you’d like to take in a rare in-person evening with Bob The Drag Queen at the Lincoln Theatre — or opt for the Jinx and DeLa holiday brew at the Lincoln.
And speaking of the holidays, The Birchmere is your ticket for both a frightfully delightful queer Halloween burlesque show and a merrily twisted Xmas with a holiday romp led by Baltimore’s infamous “Pope of Trash.”
This fall’s comedy lineup is diverse and includes Matt Rogers, Sarah Silverman, Leslie Jones, and David Sedaris, not to mention the re-emergence of Kathy Griffin.
In terms of drag, you can find queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race all over, including two Sashas — Velour at Strathmore and Colby at the Warner as part of the 10th Anniversary Drag Queen Christmas.
And don’t miss local queen Pussy Noir and crew for the very last BENT at the 9:30 Club on Halloween weekend.
Adding to the mix are a smattering of guided tours throughout town, including several focused on the gardens at the lush Hillwood Estate in Upper Northwest. Another set, perfectly timed for Halloween, highlight the ghosts that haunt Congressional Cemetery — or at least, the famous souls buried there.

With the well-timed arch of an eyebrow, or just a sharp glance, Nathan Lee Graham can command a scene in silence, well before he unleashes some artful, perfectly enunciated turn of phrase.
The actor has been brandishing his enviable diction and expressive mien for decades on Broadway, in The Wild Party and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, in films from Zoolander to Theater Camp, and on TV shows, like the new Hulu sitcom Mid-Century Modern, where he stars with Nathan Lane and Matt Bomer as three mature gay friends who move in together à la The Golden Girls.

"We're expecting it to be more of a local crowd than typical, just because we have WorldPride around the corner," says Sean Morris of next weekend's Cherry -- dubbed The Cherry Element -- which is aiming for a more intimate vibe than usual.
"And since it's going to be a more local crowd," the board president of the Cherry Fund continues, "we wanted to embrace the local DJ community and give our local DJs more opportunities. So Friday, Saturday, and Sunday all have a local DJ that will be doing the opening set for the big names that we're bringing in."
DJ Jake Maxwell kicks things off Friday, April 11, at DC9 (1940 9th St. NW) along with headliner Oral Sabag. DJ Tezrah will get the party started Saturday, April 12, at BETTE (1235 W St. NE), a relatively new medium-sized space in Brentwood complex that once housed BET Studios.

Hard to believe, but WorldPride 2025 is almost upon us. It's sure to be a pride for the ages, with more -- a whole lot more -- than any before in our city's now 50-year history of Pride. Yet, denizens of D.C. and the National Capital Region have plenty of reasons to be prideful all season long, thanks to a steady and ever-flowing stream of LGBTQ and allied artists, authors, comedians, celebrities, drag acts, DJs, storytellers, and extraordinary entertainers galore.
