It looks like a new ‘Brat’ remix may be in the works
Charli XCX has shared a cryptic new post, which could indicate that a collaboration with Troye Sivan and Dua Lipa is on the way.
Having recently declared an end to ‘Brat’ summer – the cultural phenomenon that saw her ‘Brat’ album take over social media – the singer has hinted that a new release is on the way.
It comes as Charli has recently made a post on her private Instagram account, 360_brat, sharing what some think is a teaser for an upcoming remix of one of the ‘Brat’ tracks.
Initially created as a way for the singer to tease upcoming, ‘Brat’-related projects with fans, last night (September 8) a post was shared which saw Dua Lipa speaking Spanish on a voicenote.
In the clip, the ‘Training Season’ singer can be heard saying: “Charli, Troye, un besito para ti,” which translates to “Charli, Troye, a little kiss for you”.

This, some are convinced, could indicate that the three of them will be sharing a remix of the song ‘Talk Talk’, as the outro of the original song sees Charli sing: “Talk to me in French / talk to me in Spanish / talk to me in your own made-up language”.
“Dua Lipa on the Charli xcx feat Troye Sivan talk talk remix…..talk to me in spanish yup!” one fan wrote on Twitter/X upon seeing the update, speculating if the post could indicate a collaboration. Another shared: “If it’s talk talk stoppp that’s like my fav song on the album and if I gets a ft with Dua omg”.

If the cryptic post does turn out to be a remix with both Sivan and Lipa, it will come just as Charli XCX and Troye Sivan are gearing up to start their ‘Sweat’ tour later this month.
The dates start on Saturday (September 14) with an opening show at  Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. From there, it’ll make stops in Boston, New York, Toronto, Phoenix, Los Angeles and more, before ending in Seattle on October 23. Visit here for remaining tickets.
While the potential remix hasn’t yet been confirmed by Sivan, Charli or Lipa, the speculation does arrive following Paris Hilton revealing that she wants to join forces with the ‘Von Dutch’ singer.
“Every time I’ve spoken with [Charli] she’s like, ‘You’ve always been such an inspiration to my music.’ So I just think it just makes so much sense for us to do a song together,” she said.
In a four-star review of the record, NME wrote: “It all paints a picture of who XCX is in 2024. Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”.

Last week, A. G. Cook and Finn Keane – two of the producers behind ‘Brat’ – spoke to NME at the 2024 Mercury Prize about what it was like to work on the album, as well as revealing the thing that sets Charli XCX apart from everyone else.
“This album was very different to work on than pretty much everything else that I’ve taken part in because it was so focused and relentless. Charli really has this clear vision,” Cook explained. “We knew it was going to be called ‘Brat’ for the entire two years of making it, and we cut anything that wasn’t ‘Brat. If it didn’t feel ‘Brat’, it was gone! We’d barely even talk about it again out of embarrassment of it not being ‘Brat’ enough.”
Keane continued: “Charli always has a vision of where she is and where she wants to go, but with this, I think it was more than ever.”
