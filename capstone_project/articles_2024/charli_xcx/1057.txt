Beyonce made history during the Grammys ceremony in 2023, securing the most awards won in a lifetime after picking up her 32nd gong.
However, the star has never won the prestigious album of the year prize.
This year, Cowboy Carter has secured nods for album of the year and best country album, while track Texas Hold ‚ÄòEm is up for the coveted record of the year, song of the year and country song of the year.
Tracks from the album include Bodyguard, which was nominated for best pop solo performance, and Levii‚Äôs Jeans featuring Post Malone, which is up for best pop duo performance, while 16 Carriages received a nod for best country solo performance and II Most Wanted featuring Miley Cyrus is up for best country duo.
Kendrick Lamar, Charli XCX, Post Malone and Billie Eilish all follow Beyonce with seven nominations each, while Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter each scored six nods.
Swift‚Äôs surprise double album The Tortured Poets Department will compete for album of the year, with her track featuring Post Malone titled Fortnight up for record of the year and song of the year.
It comes after Swift made Grammy history in February, as the first person to win album of the year four times.
The US star used her acceptance speech at the ceremony to announce the release of her 11th studio album, which saw her become the most-streamed artist in a single day on streaming platform Spotify.
The Grammy nominations on Friday also saw US star Eilish nominated in the top categories for her third studio album, Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is up for album of the year.
The fourth track on the record, titled Birds Of A Feather, scored nods for record of the year and song of the year.
The nominations also saw a host of British stars nominated, including Charli XCX whose sixth studio album Brat, which inspired a summer trend, is also competing in the album of the year category.
Her track 360 is also up for record of the year, while her duet with Eilish titled Guess secured a nod for best pop duo performance.
The Beatles Now And Then track is also up for record of the year, while British star Raye received nods for best new artist and songwriter of the year non-classical.
She shared a video of herself crying after receiving news of the nominations, writing: ‚ÄúGod knows all it took to get here. This is too much. I can‚Äôt stop crying.‚Äù
Raye will compete with breakout star Roan in the new artist category. Roan‚Äôs album The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess features in the album of the year category, while her track Good Luck, Babe! is up for record and song of the year.
