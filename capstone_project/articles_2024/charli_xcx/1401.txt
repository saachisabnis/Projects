Charli XCX recruited Billie Eilish for a remix of "Guess" off the deluxe edition of her latest album brat and fans are convinced a certain lyric in the song is a Taylor Swift diss. The lyric in question comes near the end of the track, when the two whisper: "You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin’ about? (You’ve been disrespectful)/ Still tryin’ to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)/ You wanna guess the address of the party we’re at (You really are not invited)."
Fans believe the duo is throwing shade at Swift for a few reasons. For one, Swift released a number of variants of her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, which helped her stay on top of the charts and blocked both Carli and Billie's albums from reaching No. 1. Swifties came for Billie after she criticized artists who released multiple vinyl variants to boost sales as being "wasteful."
“Okay so it would be so awesome if people would stop putting words into my mouth and actually read what I said in that Billboard article,” Billie wrote on her Instagram story at the time. “I wasn’t singling anyone out, these are industry-wide systemic issues. & when it comes to variants, so many artists release them – including ME! Which I clearly state in the article.”
Rumors have also swirled that Charli's song "Sympathy Is a Knife" features a jab at the pop star, when she sings: “Don’t want to see you backstage at my boyfriend’s show.” Fans speculate the line is about Swift because Charli's engaged to The 1975's George Daniel and Swift shared a brief yet passionate romance with the band's singer Matty Healy.
