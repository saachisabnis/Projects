Mind’s Eye is the debut release from NYC band Can’t Read. Inspired by ‘80s hardcore and evolved from a college punk band, the eight-track album is equal parts crunchy and dreamy. Aside from its core influences, it also takes swings at alt-rock, shoegaze and indie, creating a sound likened to rock staples like Pavement and Sebadoh. Mind’s Eye was also mastered by Harrison Smith, who has collaborated with Charli XCX and led his own musical projects, The Dare and Turtlenecked. Writer Marc Matchak writes of the debut: “In keeping with [Primordial Void] labelmeister Marcel Sletten’s pledge for honest music, this is an enduring sound made by hardworking individuals.” The show will be opened by team deathmatch, a dreamy rock band from Atlanta, local country rock supergroup Dividers and indie jangle pop band Nanocar.
