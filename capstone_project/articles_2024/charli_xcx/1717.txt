It was a big night for Taylor Swift and Beyonce! Both women making history.
Beyonce won Top Female Country Artist, her first award in a country music category. It’s a big one. Congratulations Bey.
And Taylor Swift became the most decorated artist in Billboard Music Award Show history, just ahead of her 35th birthday.
Taylor took home 10 awards at the Billboard Music Awards ceremony on December 12.  Among the 10 awards was the night’s biggest award, Top Artist, as well as Top Billboard 200 Album for The Tortured Poets Department.
With those new trophies, Swift becomes the winningest artist in the show’s 31-year history. Bringing her total career wins to 49.
“This is the nicest early birthday present you could have given me,” Swift said in a pre-recorded speech. “So, thank you very much. I love it. It’s exactly what I wanted.”
Taylor was not at the ceremony but she added in her speech that, “Everything that’s happened with the Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department, I just have to say thank you. It means the world to me that you guys embraced the things I’ve made, and the fact that you care so much about my music.”
