Summer might officially be over, but brat season is still in full swing, especially now that Charli XCX is bringing her famous album on the road. The British pop star is co-headlining the Sweat Tour with her friend and frequent collaborator, Troye Sivan, taking over arenas in 21 cities across the country (and parts of Canada). And if the footage spreading across TikTok is any proof, it looks like a total party, complete with Y2K-inspired looks, guest stars (like Lorde and Addison Rae), and hordes of well-dressed fans. 
While the shows kicked off on September 14 in Detroit, the duo will be touring together through October 23, so there’s still plenty of time to catch them live if you’re getting FOMO. (And if you need any tips on what to wear, check out our guide to brat style.) Plus, there’s more music to look forward to with Charli releasing Brat, and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat, featuring new versions of the songs on the previous album, on October 11.   
While there are still some seats up for grabs on Ticketmaster, most stubs online seem to be available via resellers. Try comparing your options online first, and check out the protections each site offers, before making your purchase. But once your tickets are secured, all you’ll need to worry about next is sweating the night away.
