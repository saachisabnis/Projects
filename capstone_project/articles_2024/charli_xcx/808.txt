Welcome to a special edition of mostly Olympics themed cultural things to do and see this week (Deadpool and Wolverine would probably take part if real). 
Running alongside the Games is the Cultural Olympiad, a vast array of free creative events being hosted across Paris, which all take inspiration from the themes and values of the Olympic Games. 
We've also been busy rounding up our best of 2024 movies, TV shows and music, so prepare yourselves for a content marathon that ensures great taste at the finish line. 
A reminder also that there's Fernando Botero open-air sculpture exhibition in Rome, a showcase of iconic cinematic props in Turin and a celebration of everyone's favourite plastic girlie at The Design Museum in London. Phew! 
All that's left to say is ready, steady, go forth and enjoy another week of golden recommendations. 
Paris 2024 Olympics-themed exhibitions
If you're in Paris for the Olympics, woah boy, there's a lot of art to check out alongside all the sporting events. In fact, it's not only in Paris. Cities all across Europe are celebrating the year's biggest event - from a Croatian exhibition dedicated to the ancient and modern Games, to a UK showcase of works and sculptures inspired by the Games a century ago. Find a full list of Olympic-inspired exhibitions here. 
'In the Eye of the Storm: Modernism in Ukraine, 1900-1930' at the Royal Academy (London, UK)
A striking collection of modernist Ukrainian art from between 1900 to 1930, this exhibition captures the expressions of a nation that has been troubled and torn by war for centuries. There are 65 works on display - from oil paintings to theatre design - each representing the diversity of styles and different cultural identities that were emerging within this time. It's also an opportunity to get to know some of the country's best and previously undiscovered artists, while continuing to support the cultural institutions that are still struggling to protect themselves following Russia's invasion (everything on show here was loaned from the National Art Museum of Ukraine and the Museum of Theatre, Music and Cinema of Ukraine in Kyiv). See it until 13 October 2024. 
Deadpool & Wolverine
“Your little Cinematic Universe is about to change forever,” Deadpool quips in one of the early teasers for Marvel's upcoming summer blockbuster... Times have been tough for the MCU following a series of cinematic flops, most notably 2023's The Marvels, which suffered the worst opening weekend at the cinema in the studio's history. After dominating the box office for over a decade, it seems superhero fatigue has well and truly set in. But if there's anything that could bring audiences back, it's a Deadpool x Wolverine (wearing the OG comic book costume!) crossover bromance. A classic team up to fight against world-ending evil, the pairing of two beloved characters and a screenplay laden with sardonic wit has the potential to breathe new life into the genre - or end up being another Thanos snap. 
Our resident film critic David Mouriquand got his claws out and isn't entirely convinced it's the MCU-saving blockbuster of the year. You can read his full review here.
Time Bandits (Apple TV+)
A reworking of Terry Gilliam's cult classic 1981 movie of the same name, this new Apple TV+ series is helmed by the kooky minds of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi (Flight of the Conchords, What We Do in the Shadows), and Iain Morris (The Inbetweeners). It stars Kal-El Tuck as 11-year-old history obsessive Kevin, who finds himself among a swarm of space robbers after discovering a portal to a parallel universe where time travel is possible. Also starring Lisa Kudrow as gang leader Penelope and Clement as 'Pure Evil', who's trying to get his hands on a stolen map, it's adventurous fun that gives a new tone to an old classic. 
Simone Biles: Rising (Netflix)
At just 27-years old, Simone Biles is one of the greatest gymnasts in the world. She has won a total of 37 Olympic and World Championship medals and was also the first American female gymnast to win four gold medals at a single Olympic Games and six world all-around titles. Then, in 2021, she made headlines after withdrawing from the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health after struggling with a sudden loss of spacial awareness - a gymnastic phenomenon known as the 'twisties'. This particular time is the focus of a new a four-part Netflix docuseries, which begins in 2020 and builds towards her upcoming participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics. A powerful look at the mental fortitude required to reach the physical pinnacles of achievement. 
The ultimate Summer Olympics playlist for Paris 2024

Whether you're throwing a themed party, absorbing to energy of Paris or even preparing to compete yourself, these tunes are designed to capture the passion and diversity of the Games. And to all those that plan on attempting some breaking to these tracks - careful, please!
