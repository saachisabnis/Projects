“She’s one of a kind”
Charli XCX has discussed her love of Rihanna, and shared how she ranks her above all other pop stars, barring one.
The topic arose during a new interview with the ‘360’ singer, where she was asked to rank some of the biggest names in pop, including Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga and Olivia Rodrigo.
During the discussion – which was shared on TikTok yesterday (June 17) – Charli was presented with some quickfire questions about which artists she prefers. “I’m so scared for this whole thing,” she said at the very start, before being asked to decide between the ‘Work’ singer and Lady Gaga first, for which she chose the former.
Her answer didn’t change for nearly the entire interview, with her laughing and explaining that she’s now noticed that she is a “stan” for the singer. She chose Ri over the likes of Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, Lorde, Phoebe Bridgers, Troye Sivan, Lily Allen, Olivia Rodrigo, Harry Styles, Camila Cabello and more.
Some were a close call for her though, with her expressing that while she thinks Rihanna ranks higher than Sabrina Carpenter, she does love the latter’s hit single ‘Espresso’.
She also added that she thinks Chappell Roan is “obviously God tier”, she does prefer the ‘Rude Boy’ singer. A similar argument was made for Doja Cat too, with Charli saying that even though she doesn’t rank her higher than Ri, she “loves Doja Cat’s record, and her whole, like, what she’s doing.”

“I’m the biggest Rihanna stan ever,” she exclaimed after picking the singer again, this time over The 1975, even despite being engaged to the band’s drummer George Daniel.
Only one artist managed to knock Rihanna off the top spot during the clip – Sky Ferreira. It was only once the two were pitted together that the ‘Boom Clap’ singer took a moment to think about the decision, before ultimately settling on the latter. “It’s really tough… That didn’t come lightly. I really love Sky. She’s one of a kind,” she said.
The clip has now gone viral, and has gathered over 44,000 likes and 356,000 views in less than 24 hours. It also comes following the pop star discussing what it’s like to be pitted against other female artists on her new track ‘Girl, So Confusing’.
The song is part of her latest album ‘Brat’, and in a discussion with The Guardian Charli opened up about the inspiration.
“In the music industry, it was distilled into this idea that if you support women, and you like other women, then you’re a good feminist,” she said. “The reverse of that is, if you don’t like all other women who exist and breathe on this Earth then you’re a bad feminist … That’s just such an unrealistic expectation of women.”
‘Brat’ was given a glowing four-star review by NME, with Hannah Mylrea writing: “Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”. With ‘Brat’, XCX demonstrates that going her own way will always sound pretty good.”
Following the release of ‘Brat’, Lorde has also praised Charli and the album, stating: “The only album I’ve ever pre-saved is out today. Charli just cooked this one different. So much grit, grace & skin in the game.”
