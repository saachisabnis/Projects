Charli XCX has been dropping hints about her new album for a few months now and her stans have had their own theories about the project, which was being referred to by the fandom as “XCX6.”
The latest update – which wasn’t so much a teaser as it was an actual preview – arrived in the form of Charli’s Boiler Room. Hypebeast was onsite at the Bushwick, Brooklyn event, where the British pop artist played several unreleased songs from the new album, alongside a few older fan favorites.
Charli has now revealed that the album is called Brat and will comprise 15 songs, running 41 minutes long. She previously shared that the LP is a “a club record.”
“i was born to make dance music.. i came from the clubs.. xcx6 is the album i’ve always wanted to make,” Charli wrote on X.
The singer will return tomorrow with the first song from Brat, “Von Dutch.”
