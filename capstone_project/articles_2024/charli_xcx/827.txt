Charli XCX is ready to conquer the big screen after dominating social media this Brat summer with her viral song and dance sensations. The pop superstar has just been cast in Gregg Araki’s new film, I Want Your Sex. Charli joins the previously announced leads Olivia Wilde and Licorice Pizza‘s Cooper Hoffman, though what specific role she will play in the movie has not been revealed as of yet. I Want Your Sex is the second movie role that Charli has been cast in, along with last spring’s announcement that the singer will be featured in Daniel Goldhaber’s upcoming remake of the cult classic, Faces of Death, from Legendary Entertainment. Charli XCX is also getting set to launch her North American tour in support of Brat later this month, as Charli and Troye Sivan’s collaborative Sweat tour starts up on September 14 in Detroit.
