After serving double-duty on Saturday Night Live as the show’s host and musical guest, Charli XCX turned Times Square into a dance club on Monday (November 19) by delivering a surprise pop-up performance at the H&M that brought out thousands of fans. The neon billboards in Times Square were lit up in Brat green for the occasion, as Charli performed in a small shop window of the store above the huge crowd while the music played over loudspeakers. Charli previously teased that she had a surprise planned for New York City after wrapping up her SNL gig, and the pop superstar shared the free show announcement in an Instagram video shortly before she hit the stage, “I’m performing live today in Times Square at 6:30 p.m. so don’t miss out if you’re in New York.” Charli performed a 5-song set featuring “365,” “360,” “Von Dutch,” “Apple,” and “Guess,” all taken from her Grammy Album of the Year nominee, Brat.
