Having partnered with Primavera Sound for the last three years, Barcelona-based car manufacturer Cupra set out to make this year’s activations bigger than ever. Amongst its offerings, the famous Boiler Room x Cupra stage returned to the beachside location and special unveiling of its latest cars also took place. However, it was Charli XCX’s surprise pop-up that became the brand’s most popular attraction over the weekend.
A regular fixture on Primavera Sound line-ups, the singer-come-DJ has grown to be a must-see performer with fans gathering in Barcelona to watch her sets. This year’s headline, however, came with unprecedented anticipation as the singer took to the main stage just days before the release of her new album BRAT. In a move to add to the excitement, the surprise Cupra pop-up saw Charli XCX join A.G. Cook and George Daniel, treating festival-goers to a special PARTYGIRL DJ set ahead of her headline performance at Primavera Sound.

Making a bold statement, the singer pulled up to the beach event in Cupra’s Born VZ, a performance-built, 100% electric automotive with a dynamic silhouette that appeared to naturally suit her futuristic look. Against a vibrant green backdrop, hinting at her new album cover, she went on to play a series of her own tracks remixed confidently with heavy dance beats. Like Cupra’s ethos, her set proved to be both rebellious and unconventional, leaving fans hungry for more.
