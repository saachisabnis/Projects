Dave Grohl’s eldest daughter, Violet Grohl, is planning on releasing her debut album sometime soon. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the 18-year-old singer has been “incredibly committed” to working on her music and “to growing as an artist.” Violet has been collaborating with producer Justin Raisen on the project, who previously worked with Kim Gordon on her Grammy-nominated album The Collective, in addition to past projects with Charli XCX, Lil Yachty, and Sky Ferreira. Violet is apparently writing and recording material in the studio space she received as a birthday gift from her father. Back in 2018, a then 12-year-old Violet made her live debut alongside her dad at a benefit concert, and went on to tour as a backing vocalist for the Foo Fighters in recent years. “She’s a true torch singer,” says one source. “Her vocals are tremendous. She’s very talented.” (Consequence of Sound)
