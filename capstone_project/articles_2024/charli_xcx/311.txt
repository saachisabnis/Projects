If you were down the pub instead of being at home watching the BRIT Awards on Saturday night, you missed out.
There were plenty of memorable moments as the stars descended on London‚Äôs O2 Arena for the biggest night in the British music calendar.
There were incredible performances from the likes of Dua Lipa, Kylie Minogue and Raye as well as some amazing red carpet looks and political statements.
So if you need bringing up to speed on what went down, we‚Äôve rounded up all the top moments you need to see...

Presenting the award for Best Song, Jo Hamilton, a former postmistress impacted by the Horizon scandal had her say.
‚ÄúI just want to thank everybody in the country literally for the love and support they‚Äôve given the postmasters,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúPlease could you keep on supporting us,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBecause in spite of what the government says, they are not paying the postmasters. Thank you.‚Äù
