In a new Rolling Stone cover story, Chappell Roan discussed the support she has received regarding her comments about toxic fan behavior. Roan revealed that a number of pop contemporaries have reached out with their support. Charli XCX, Billie Eilish, Hayley Williams, Katy Perry, Lorde, Muna, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Mitski have all shown solidarity with Roan. 
“I’m not trying to name-drop,” she said. “I’m trying to tell you there are girls who are good people, who are helping other girls out. I’m name-dropping them because people just need to know that people are good people.” Roan singled out Sabrina Carpenter, who also finds herself at the top of the charts and in the media spotlight. “We’re both going through something so f–king hard … she just feels like everything is flying, and she’s just barely hanging on,” Roan said. “It was just good to know someone else feels that way.” 
Roan did disclose that unfortunately, “Not a lot of boys have been like, ‘Let me know if you ever want to talk about it,’” she said, though Elton John, Orville Peck, Troye Sivan and Noah Kahan have offered their support. (Billboard)
