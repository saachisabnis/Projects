            "Von Dutch" is produced by PC Music affiliate EasyFun and is written from the perspective of someone who knows they are the center of attention. "It’s alright to just admit that I’m your fantasy /​you’re obsessing, just confess it ​’cause it’s obvious," she sings over the glossy club-pop beat.
          

            In a recent cover feature with The Face, XCX said that her lyrics on Brat are more true to the way she speaks than ever on previous albums. ​"I was sharing my process with friends and people who don’t make music, and [the lyrics] were becoming conversational, like things I would text people," she told the magazine. "It was beginning to feel gossipy in a fun way, so I leant into it."
          

Brat will be XCX's first album since she released Crash in 2022. 
          

            More recently, she has collaborated on new songs by A.G. Cook and Sam Smith, as well as getting engaged to her partner, The 1975's Geroge Daniel. Last year she contributed "Speed Drive" to the Barbie soundtrack.
