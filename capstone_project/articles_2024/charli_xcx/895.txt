You know what's better than a Brat Summer? A Brat Autumn. Because Charli XCX's Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat is set to drop on October 11th, and it looks like Ariana Grande is joining Charli's 'Brat' world.
Billboards have been popping up across the country, "Brat" style, with the names of artists backward in their respective hometowns to tease who will be featured on this "completely different" version of Brat. The newest billboard to pop up is located in Boca Raton, Florida (Ari's hometown), and of course has her name on it in the same fashion.
A few photos and videos of the billboard have surfaced online.
Charli has yet to release the full track list for Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat, but billboards have been sprouting up across the country to tease the new remixes. The original version of Brat was released over the summer, and featured 15 new songs, including "Talk Talk" which has already seen a remix from Troye Sivan. These new billboards have fans speculating which songs artists will appear on.
The new version of the album is set to drop next week on October 11th. In the meantime, listen to Charli's original Brat on iHeartRadio.
