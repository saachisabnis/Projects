Matty Healy, lead singer of The 1975, has been in a relationship with model and influencer Gabbriette Bechtel since late 2023. In an interview with Highsnobiety published in March, Bechtel candidly shared her feelings regarding the internet’s constant speculation about them.
“I don’t give a shit. I think it’s hilarious. Go for it. Have fun. People have a lot to say,” she laughed. “You don’t know me at all.”
Arguably, Healy’s most well-known relationship came just before he began seeing Bechtel. From May to June 2023, the singer briefly and memorably dated Taylor Swift. The musicians first met in 2014, and while relationship rumors swirled over the years, the two were never official. Now, social media is ablaze with talk that Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department, is actually about her ex, Healy.
So, who is Healy’s latest love? Ahead, everything to know about Bechtel and her relationship with Healy. 
Healy and Bechtel’s relationship timeline begins in September 2023. In some photos obtained by People, the pair is seen kissing, hugging, and holding hands while walking together in New York City. 
They have since had several PDA sightings, like in November, when they were spotted with their arms wrapped around each other in New York.
Things seem to be getting serious between them by February 2024, when Bechtel was seen spending time with Healy’s family. Daily Mail shared some pictures of Healy and Bechtel heading to the theater to watch his mother Diane Welch’s play, The Gap. Also in attendance was Healy’s brother, as well as his father, Tim Healy, and his wife. 
Previously, in October 2023, Welch showed Bechtel some support on her Instagram. When the model posted a photo wearing nothing but a G-string thong and leather apron from her collaboration with R & M Leathers, Healy’s mom commented, “That’s exactly how I hope to look in mine when it arrives!! 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️.”
On June 11, the couple announced they were engaged after attending Charli XCX’s Brat show in Brooklyn. Bechtel shared photos of herself wearing the ring, which she was first spotted wearing in May, according to People. The ring is centered with a black diamond surrounded by white diamonds.
“MARRYING THE 1975 IS VERY BRAT,” she wrote in the caption.
Denise Welch, Healy’s mom, confirmed the engagement on Loose Women the following day.
“I obviously have known for a few weeks that Matty got engaged,” she said. “They went over to see their friends Charli and George in New York [last night] and I woke up this morning to the fact they’ve put it on Instagram. Instagram official ... he's got engaged to Gabriella Bechtel—Gabbriette she's known as. Black diamond; he had it made for her...I couldn't be more thrilled. We couldn't be happier—she is everything I would want in a daughter-in-law. I'm thrilled.”
The couple were photographed at The O2 Silver Clef Awards on Friday, July 5, sharing a quiet conversation outside Grosvenor House Hotel in London. Healy was smoking a cigarette as Bechtel leaned into him and put a kiss on his cheek. The 1975 frontman was wearing a navy blazer with jeans and the model wore a black dress with a turtleneck and a pair of black heels. During the awards, The 1975 won the award for Best Group.
In a May 2023 interview with Vogue, Bechtel shared that she was born and raised in Orange County, and originally moved to Los Angeles to pursue a her dream of becoming a professional ballerina.
“I was convinced I was going to be a professional ballerina, and I still am,” she said. 
However, her career plans shifted after she was cast by MTV to dance in music videos for Blood Orange (Dev Hynes). 
“I put a few dance videos on my Instagram, and somebody reached out to me and said that Dev was having an open call,” she told Highsnobiety. “We had a few fun days of rehearsal and started to film the music video, and then I got a call that I was cut. I didn’t make it into the music video, but I did all of the rehearsals, and I think my feet are in it at some point.”
Her modeling career began shortly after. 
“I was an unpaid, hard-working model for a very long time,” Bechtel revealed.  
Now, Bechtel has modeled for brands like Heaven by Marc Jacobs, Diesel, Miu Miu, and Betsey Johnson. Most recently, on April 15, she graced the cover of HommeGirls.
 Bechtel is multitalented. In 2019, she was handpicked by Charli XCX to be the lead singer of a band called Nasty Cherry for a Netflix documentary series, I’m with the Band: Nasty Cherry.
“I met [Charli XCX] on the set of a music video, and we ended up partying together for a few years,” she recalls. “I didn’t see her for a while, and then she reached out and was like, ‘I’m doing this project and I’ve been trying to cast the singer…’” Bechtel told Highsnobiety.  
Unfortunately, Nasty Cherry is no longer active do to the the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We couldn’t do anything together, we couldn’t tour our second EP, and we weren’t able to make music together because we were all in different places in the world. So we just decided that it wasn’t going to work out anymore,” she revealed. “I miss it all the time. It ended too abruptly.”
Bechtel also has a social media presence. Aside from her 782,000 followers on Instagram, she has amassed 382,300 on TikTok, where she mostly posts cooking videos. In May 2023, she posted a video recreating Erewhon’s grain-free vegan blackout cake, which garnered 3 million views.
Per Highsnobiety, Bechtel shared that she got her love of cooking from her Mexican mother and Swiss-German father, both of whom would cook food from their respective cultures. 
 “We ate dinner together as a family every single night, so there was always a fresh meal. We never had takeout,” she recalls. “We had a lot of Bon Appétit magazines lying around, so [my mother] would always try new recipes. I would come home and she’d have it open and be like, ‘I’m making this tonight,’ and she’d nail it. I would help her prep, so I grew up with my mom testing out stuff.”
She also shared with Vogue that she is working on a cookbook and eventually would love to open up her own café.
“Not many people know this, but I’m really into interior design. So I’d love to open a space so people can have the full experience,” Bechtel said. 
Bechtel was born on July 28, 1997, making her a Leo. Healy, 36, was born on April 8, making him an Aries. According to the AstroTwins, per ELLE.com, “A pair of dynamic fire signs, Aries and Leo make a head-turning duo that whips up passion, adventure, and a heavy dose of drama everywhere you go. A flashy, outspoken pair, you’ll inspire envy. Get ready to reinvent the rules of relationships since your connection is certain to play by its own bold agenda.”
