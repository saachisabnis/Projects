Half a year ago, my cutefused sapphic muse (CFSM), a fellow frosh poet with angelic aura at Brown University, was ghosted by this yacht-owning boy who still possesses an undying passion for sticks. After their lovely first date, Valentine’s Day was coming up, yet the boy took on a cryptic persona. A particularly soulful interaction on Valentine’s Day went like this: 
Boy: *adds to Instagram note* 🕵️
CFSM: *replies to the note asking what he means* 
Boy: yeah imma detective 
CFSM: what are you detecting 
Boy: mysteries 
CFSM: what kind of mysteries 
Boy: spooky ones 
CFSM: *serving omniscient yet curious with an affinity for the grotesque and a tendency to find beauty in the mundane* are there any mysteries i can clear up for you?
(the end)
As an East Asian, I am a product of Confusionism (more than Confucianism), and Charli XCX’s “Girl, so confusing” further heightens my awareness of everything I find confusing. Perhaps the stick-loving bro was onto something—there must be so many spooky mysteries, especially during this spooky Halloween season. 
Some of these spooky mysteries I can possibly clear up for you. Others, perhaps not so much. Wishing you beauty in ambiguity, I hope this list finds you well-confused.
