Brat Summer is coming to a theater near you. Jeremy O. Harris and Charli XCX star in an upcoming movie, Erupcja, meaning eruption in Polish, with director Pete Ohs, reports Variety. It’ll follow an explosive relationship between a Polish woman who lives in Warsaw (Lena Góra) and a shy woman named Bethany (Charli XCX). “Charli is an excellent actress,” Ohs shared on her acting skills. “She is a performer. She understands what it’s like to have a camera pointed at her. She understands how to convey things through all the different ways in which we communicate, whether it’s with body language or your voice or your facial expressions. She had a scene where she cried, without being asked – she could deliver all the goods. She’s a legit actress. I am proud of us for making a movie this way during ‘Brat’ summer.” The two were introduced by Harris at a party, where Charli shared she’d love to do a movie in Ohs’s style.
But it was almost impossible to keep the film a secret; when they were filming in Warsaw, people wouldn’t stop asking for a photo with Charli, especially when she showed up to a Polish club. It makes sense since everyone has been doing the apple dance; they know who Charli is. Now, the biggest secret is figuring out how “opposite” Bethany will be from Charli.
