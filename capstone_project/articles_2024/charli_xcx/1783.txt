On Thursday, June 20th, the estival solstice officially kicked off summer in the Northern Hemisphere. With festival season in full swing, ‘Dancing Astronaut’ warmly presents the latest edition of its esteemed Pulsar Playback series. Highlighting 50 hand-picked dance records, Pulsar Playback: June 2024 exhibits one of the series’ most competitive track lists since its inception.
Boasting one of June’s most anticipated releases, Dom Dolla officially unlocked “girl$” on Friday, June 7th. Of similar echelons, Swedish House Mafia, with “Lioness,” and Fred again.., with “places to be,” contributed to the same rock solid foundation underpinning what would be an exceptional month in dance music. Nearing June’s halfway point, the dance community bore witness to a second wave of scene shaping music. Duck Sauce, for example, advanced their revival era with “Can’t Stop,” as John Summit, re-enlisting “Go Back” vocalist Julia Church, joined forces with Kaskade for a pivotal collaboration in “Resonate.”
The final wave of notable arrivals included Rüfüs Du Sol‘s monumental comeback single, “Music Is Better,” Hayden James‘ early release album track (and album announcement), “Deep Diving,” Gorgon City‘s collaboration with NORTH, “Breathe You In,” Charlotte de Witte‘s “How You Move,” and many more. Even Disco Dom, powered by Dombresky, returned after a year-long hiatus with Inferno (No. 2). Also featuring Charli XCX, Seven Lions, Matoma, and KREAM, among others, Pulsar Playback: June 2024 offers summer-primed dance records from industry defining artists.
