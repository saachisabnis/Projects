"I am so proud to call her my friend and we have been waiting to make a tune together"
Jessie Ware brought Romy out during her Glastonbury 2024 performance to debut their forthcoming track ‘Lift You Up’. Check it out below.
While performing on the West Holts stage tonight (June 29), Ware introduced Romy to the crowd saying it was a “huge honour” to welcome the XX singer to the stage. “I have seen her and her band grow up and I have seen her smash it,” Ware said. “I am so proud to call her my friend and we have been waiting to make a tune together.” The duo then performed their euphoric new track ‘Lift You Up’.
Built around an uplifting, dance piano, the track includes the lyrics “I’m gonna lift you up inside this feeling / I’m gonna give you something to believe in.”

The journey to West Holts has been long for Ware, who’s attended the festival as both a punter and a backing singer prior to performing under her own name. “I’ve sung where you are right there,” she told fans watching her headline slot. “I’ve sung to Janelle Monáe, FKA Twigs. Who else? Disclosure, Bryan Ferry and now we’re here.”
“Thank you so much. it means the world to me that you’ve decided to spend your evening with us,” she told fans.
“I’ve been playing this festival for a while, I’m very lucky. I came and watched all my friends be in really cool indie bands and I’d be there in the crowd lifting them up when they’d crowd surf,” she said. “I was so excited, sneaking backstage to meet Beth Ditto and being a punter and getting really in the thick of it.”
Ware first performed at Glastonbury as a backing singer, with her friend Jack Peñate. “I was like ‘this is so cool’,” she told the crowd while reminiscing her earliest gigs at Worthy Farm. “I’ve slowly gone round to the different stages and now we’re here at West Holts and it feels great.”
Ware’s performance re-imagined the West Holts Stage as a nightclub called ‘Club Pearl’, with the singer asking the crowd to call her “Mother of Pearl” for the duration of her set. Her performance also included an emotional cover of Cher‘s ‘Believe’, during which she left the stage to join the crowd on the floor.
Elsewhere in her joyful headline slot, Ware led the crowd in a choreographed dance routine to her 2023 track ‘Beautiful People’.
