(KRON) — Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris launched a TikTok page on Thursday. VP Harris launched the page with a single post, captioned, “Thought it was time to join!”
In the eight-second video, an off-camera voice asks the VP, “Madam Vice President, are you on TikTok?”
“Well, I’ve heard that recently I’ve been on the For You Page, so I thought I’d get on here myself,” a smiling Harris responds.
 What is the ‘KHive?’ 
Harris has emerged as the virtually uncontested front runner to assume the Democratic Party’s nomination for president following President Joe Biden’s seismic announcement last week that he would drop out. In the days since then, Harris has seen a strong surge in polls of younger voters, believed to be fueled in part by TikTok videos, memes, and social media engagement from a younger slice of the electorate.
Clips of the VP dancing, and memes referencing a “coconut tree” anecdote Harris shared regarding her mother, have been particularly popular. Harris’ campaign also appears to be trying to leverage a tweet from British pop star Charli XCX that read simply, “kamala IS brat.”
Although it was only launched Thursday afternoon, at the time of this writing, the Vice President’s TikTok has 94.5 thousand followers and 99.8 thousand likes. The account features a simple caption that reads, “When we fight, we win.”
