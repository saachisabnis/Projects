Ah, January. A new year, a clean slate, a fresh chance to… do what you’ve always done, maybe? Not that we at IndieWire don’t encourage personal growth, but we do support you if you decide to spend a lot of this month recovering from the holidays and melting into your couch in front of a watchlist. 
On Disney+, that means new episodes of “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew” and the premiere of “Goosebumps: The Vanishing.” If you’re into creepy crawlies (respectfully, check out “A Real Bug’s Life” Season 2 to document the bizarre brilliance of insects around the world, or “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man” — a new animated series from head writer Jeff Trammell and supervising director Mel Zwyer, with a voice cast including Colman Domingo, Hugh Dancy, and Charlie Cox (Daredevil cameo??).

Hulu will keep things busy as always with next-day premieres of network shows on ABC and Fox, including the new series “Going Dutch” starring Denis Leary and “Will Trent” Season. The streamer will continue to release standup under the banner “Hularious,” this time with the special “Roy Wood Jr.: Lonely Flowers.” On the originals side, look out for “Whiskey on the Rocks” set in Sweden during the Cold War, “The Best Heart Attack of My Life,” and the mysterious “Paradise”… 
Not much is known about Dan Fogelman’s forthcoming drama series, but here’s what we know (which happens to more than enough to go on): Sterling K. Brown, James Marsden, Julianne Nicholson. Brown plays secret agent Xavier Collins and Marsden plays President Bradford, who turns up dead on Collins’ watch. The teaser trailer hints that this is just the tip of the iceberg, based on clips of Collins being entrusted with highly confidential information and asked to lie while giving a police statement — and the show’s official synopsis stirs even more intrigue:
“Paradise” is set in a serene community inhabited by some of the world’s most prominent individuals. But this tranquility explodes when a shocking murder occurs and a high-stakes investigation unfolds.”
The series is executive produced by Fogelman, Brown, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, John Hoberg, Jess Rosenthal, and Steve Beers, and premieres January 28 on Hulu.
Here’s everything else coming to Hulu and Disney+ in January.
