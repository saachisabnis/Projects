LEILA FADEL, HOST:
For the first time this decade, women hold most of the top 10 spots in the latest Billboard albums charts. NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas counts them down.
ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: No big surprise. Taylor Swift's album "The Tortured Poets Department" continues its reign at No. 1 for a 10th consecutive week. But just behind her...

GRACIE ABRAMS: (Singing) I know you know it felt like somethin' old, it felt like somethin' holy, like souls bleedin', so…
TSIOULCAS: Breathy singer-songwriter, Gracie Abrams makes her debut at No. 2 with "The Secret Of Us." And did you know that she's the daughter of film director and TV showrunner J.J. Abrams? I did not.

TSIOULCAS: Billie Eilish's "Hit Me Hard And Soft" is down to No. 4 this week. And quirky new pop royal Chappell Roan continues her steady climb. Her album, "The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, " jumps up two spaces to No. 6.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "RED WINE SUPERNOVA")
CHAPPELL ROAN: Let's pick it up now. (Singing) I don't care that you're a stoner. Red wine supernova, fall right into me.
TSIOULCAS: Also part of the super women crew, Ariana Grande's "Eternal Sunshine" has sprung back up to No. 8, while Charli XCX holds her No. 9 position with her album "Brat."
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GIRL, SO CONFUSING")
CHARLI XCX: (Singing) Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl - girl, girl,
TSIOULCAS: That's six of the top 10 positions all held by women. To paraphrase the queen Beyonce, who runs the pop charts? This week, at least, it's girls.

CHARLI XCX: (Singing) How do you feel being a girl? Girl, girl. Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl. Girl, girl, girl, girl. You're all about writing poems. But I'm about throwing parties. Think you should come to my party. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.
