Jelly Roll, RAYE and Quavo have been named as honorees at Variety‘s annual Hitmakers celebration, not only for their music, but for their philanthropy and support of others.
Jelly Roll, who spent time behind bars as a young man, will receive the Changemaker of the Year Award for his work with prisoners and those in recovery.
In a statement, Variety music editor Jem Aswad said of the “I Am Not Okay” singer, “[He] speaks often of his own struggles as a young person, and has used those experiences to create and contribute to multiple efforts on behalf of incarcerated youth, addiction-recovery and more, even addressing Congress earlier this year.”
RAYE is getting the Triple Threat Award for being, Aswad says, “a forceful advocate for songwriters, who are inexplicably at the bottom of the music-streaming economy.” 
Migos rapper Quavo is Humanitarian of the Year, thanks to his establishment of the Rocket Foundation to end gun violence and to advocate for criminal violence intervention. Quavo lost his nephew and bandmate Takeoff in a shooting in 2022.
Ahead of those honors being announced, Charli XCX was named Hitmaker of the Year. All the stars will be honored at a Dec. 7 ceremony in LA.
