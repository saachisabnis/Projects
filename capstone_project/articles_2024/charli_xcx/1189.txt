Nestled in a neighborhood steeped in artistic rebellion, The Roxy Hotel New York is just a stone's throw from where NYC’s underground culture once exploded. In 1978, the Mudd Club — steps from the hotel — became a cultural lightning rod, with Keith Haring curating its edgy gallery while punk icons like The Talking Heads lit up Tribeca’s Ocean Club nearby. And as the neighborhood evolved, The Odeon emerged, Keith McNally’s iconic restaurant, drawing in the filmmakers and finance crowd who transformed Soho and Tribeca’s lofts into creative epicenters. But at The Roxy, that creative pulse is still palpable.
Channeling the glamor of a 1920s movie palace and the pulse of a ‘90s dance club, The Roxy is an exhilarating hub where art, film, and music collide. The guest rooms cleverly blend a NYC vintage ode with sleek, modern design that still emulates the real “Roxy” experience. Within its walls, a constellation of venues, from Paul’s Cocktail Lounge to Jack’s Stir Brew Coffee, continues to make Roxy a shining star within this creative epicenter. And with four incredible, new venues, The Roxy Hotel isn’t just a place to stay — it’s a lifestyle landmark and pioneer, beloved by entertainers and New Yorkers alike, always ahead of the curve.
For a quintessential downtown vibe, think cozy alcoves framed by plush velvet chairs, buttery leather seating, and the glow of soft lighting. Add in some expertly crafted cocktails, the smooth hum of jazz, and conversations that stretch late into the night. Hidden in plain sight, the Roxy Bar features all of this plus delivers world-class live jazz every night of the week — with no cover charge. Adjacent to the main bar, an opulent oyster bar dazzles with its Art Deco-inspired gilded chairs, glossy black counter, and celestial-themed wall accents — all tied together by impeccable service.
Regular performers include legends like Tim Reis, saxophonist for the Rolling Stones, and David Cook, music director for Taylor Swift. The bar’s commitment to making live music accessible is evident, attracting both seasoned jazz aficionados and curious newcomers alike. As the evening deepens, the vibe shifts — vinyl-spinning DJs take over the Oyster Bar’s decks, setting the mood with eclectic sounds. Recently, Kevin Aviance electrified the space with a set straight from his Renaissance album debut. The Roxy Hotel’s lobby and atrium, which houses the bar, also doubles as an ever-evolving art gallery, featuring exclusive photography exhibitions from icons like Pattie Boyd, Blondie’s Chris Stein, and Studio 54’s favorite photographer, Dustin Pittman.
Then, at The Django guests will be transported to a Parisian-inspired jazz club that blends old-world charm with modern flair. With its vaulted ceilings, exposed brick walls, and an intimate, subterranean ambiance, The Django features two sleek cocktail bars, an open dining area, and a performance stage outfitted with a state-of-the-art Meyer Sound system creating the ultimate setting for live jazz. Here, rising stars and Grammy-winning artists, such as Samara Joy and Steve Feifke, have honed their craft, and where legendary acts like The Roots have made surprise appearances. Night after night, the club delivers a diverse lineup of jazz performances, each paired with a sophisticated cocktail program curated by award-winning mixologist Natasha David. The Django has also become a favorite backdrop for photo shoots, attracting talent from the Jonas Brothers to drag sensation Violet Chachki.

Lastly, the Roxy Cinema New York, a true nod to the grandeur of 1920s movie palaces, offers an “old-school moviegoing experience for modern-day audiences.” This Art Deco-inspired gem in downtown Manhattan is a boutique arthouse theater celebrated for its 35mm cult classics, rare archival gems, and first-run indie films. Beyond its films, Roxy curates an eclectic array of cultural events — from director Q&As to artist collaborations—that keep cinephiles consistently engaged. And with a gourmet concession stand serving craft cocktails, beer, wine, popcorn, and candy, even the snacks are part of the experience.
Recently, pop sensation Charli xcx took the reins, guest-curating her the brat collection film series. Roxy also paid tribute to Madonna with a comprehensive film retrospective, complete with rare music video screenings and a special appearance by Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Furthermore, musicians like Weyes Blood, Steve Gunn, Adam Green, and Sunflower Bean have brought concerts and live film scores to the theater, making Roxy Cinema the prime intersection where classic cinema and cutting-edge music converge.
Lastly, the Green Room at The Roxy Hotel is a luxurious 600-square-foot venue seamlessly blends modern elegance with a flair for the theatrical. With its discreet entrance at 298 Church Street, the Green Room offers a chic and versatile setting perfect for industry insiders — whether for pre or post-screening cocktails, intimate dinners, panels, interviews, pop-up showcases, or creative gatherings. It’s a stylish hideaway where talent, filmmakers, musicians, and creatives can come together in privacy and style.
