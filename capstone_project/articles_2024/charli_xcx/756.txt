As the presidential campaign nears its end, plenty of A-list celebrities are showing up to campaign for Kamala Harris.  
Several musicians have been announced to perform at Harris’ last rallies, including Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.  
According to CBS News, Kamala Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga, The Roots, Ricky Martin and DJ Cassidy, amongst others, later today in Philadelphia. Oprah Winfrey is set to speak at the event, according to the event website. 
There will also be a Get Out The Vote rally and concert earlier on today in Pittsburgh featuring Katy Perry, Andra Day and D-Nice. 
Last night, Gaga took to social media to confirm her endorsement of Harris:

Other celebrities who have endorsed Harris include Bruce Springsteen, Harrison Ford, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Joni Mitchell, Spike Lee, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charli XCX, Cher, Eminem, Billie Eilish and Bon Iver.  
Beyoncé recently appeared with Harris in Texas at a Democratic Rally on Reproductive Rights, where she did not perform but delivered a powerful speech.
“I’m not here as a celebrity, I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother,” she said at the campaign rally.  
“A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in, a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we’re not divided.” 
“Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what’s possible with no ceilings, no limitations,” she continued. “We must vote, and we need you.” 
Trump’s stance on abortion and his previous decision to overturn the landmark reproductive rights bill Roe v. Wade have been a major point of debate in this election. Many celebrities have endorsed Harris specifically for her commitment to restoring access to abortion nationwide. 
The presence of Beyoncé seemed to irk Donald Trump, who told a crowd at his own rally on the same night: “Kamala is at a dance party with Beyoncé.”
Trump’s high-profile backers include Kanye ‘Ye’ West, Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock.
