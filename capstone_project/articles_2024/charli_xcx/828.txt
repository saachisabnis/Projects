TikTok has unveiled its ‘Songs Of The Summer 2024’, declaring that “the summer has been an iconic one for music.” 
The video sharing app continued: “Brat summers and eighties dancing, rising stars and the return of big industry names, new eras for female pop and exciting urban breakthrough genres: the summer’s biggest music moments have been popping off on TikTok.” 
The official global top spot goes to ‘Gata Only’ by FloyyMenor and Cris Mj, while the UK Song Of The Summer was Tinashe’s ‘Nasty’ - which was also Number Two on the global list.  
Tinashe’s song soundtracked more than 10 million videos on TikTok, where the lyric "match my freak" became a popular catchphrase.
Speaking about the accolade, Tinashe said: “Thank you to all my amazing fans who made ‘Nasty’ the number one Song of the Summer in the UK and number two globally! It’s been so fun and incredible to watch all the videos you have been making on TikTok. I love them all! I’m super grateful for your continued support and hope you all enjoy making more content to the rest of my album ‘Quantum Baby.’”
Other artists making the Top 10 in the global list are Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter – who also made the UK list.

Ole Obermann, Global Head of Music Business Development, TikTok, said in a statement: “Once again, TikTok’s Songs of the Summer list beautifully demonstrates how the magic of TikTok helps our global community to discover and promotes a diverse range of incredibly talented artists and their music.”
Obermann continued: “Latin music is one of the most popular genres on TikTok so it’s no surprise to see Gata Only top our global list, alongside some other amazing emerging artists like Sevdaliza and Tommy Richman, as well as superstars such as Billie Eilish.”
“The Songs of the Summer list is proof that both new and emerging artists of every genre, from anywhere in the world, can connect with over a billion music fans TikTok every day, build their careers and impact music culture."
Earlier this year, TikTok was at loggerheads with record company Universal, who threatened to pull millions of songs from TikTok over issues such as deepfake AI-generated music and artist compensation.
The dispute was resolved in May, with the two parties striking a new licensing agreement, and artists from Universal Music Group, which include Drake, Adele, Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift, returned to TikTok.
The platform remains vital for artists promoting their work, as evidenced by Charli XCX's zeitgeist-capturing ‘Brat’ album, the rollout of which was conducted on the app and became instantly memeable.
