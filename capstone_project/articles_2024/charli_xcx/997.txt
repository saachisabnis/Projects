Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions (Part 8)
2020s is a weak decade for music. By 2014, 2010s already had Adele, Gaga, The Weekend Katy, Bruno, Grande, Drake, Kendrick, Nicki, Ed Sheeran, Chance, Lana, Sam Smith, Imagine Dragons, even “Pop Swift”, “Serious Beyonce” and “Peak Rihanna”. Plus so many interesting one-hit/era wonders like Macklemore, Fun, Gotye, Carly Rae, Lorde, 21 Pilots. I could go on. 
 i blame the streaming era…many people won’t admit it but it ruined how hits are perceived
could you elaborate on that point? I would love to know your explanation/thought process! I mean obviously streaming changed music consumption but how did it change public perception of hits?
Oh man, Vox brought out the knives, lmfaoooo 
Why are so many female pop stars flopping?
Everyone from Beyonce to Dua Lipa has an album out this year. So why are the charts dominated by male country and rap?

Pop needed fresh faces and that’s what happens. Sabrina and Chappell are like big examples of it. Dua Lipa’s flopping is mix of bad luck and and not matching high expectations after FN. Camila was never a big, household name, Havana and Senorita were just big hits.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.

Correct.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Dua’s biggest album release blunder was turning down headlining Coachella (as reported by Hits Daily Double in January) because her live show for the new songs wouldn’t be ready in time.
She had the perfect bookings lined up to launch new material: Grammys -> Coachella -> SNL, that’s consistent momentum.
The Coachella livestream is massive. You know who had a star-making set? Chappell Roan. You know who launched the song of the summer at this year’s festival? Sabrina Carpenter. Dua fumbled the word of mouth ball.

2020s have Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles solo career, SZA, Taylor Swift peak, Beyonce’s trilogy… It’s not that bad. 
Billie achieved breakthrough in 2017 and peaked in 2019. That’s my problem. Dua, Harry, SZA & Billie all don’t scream “made in 2020s” if that makes sense.
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.

Yeah, SZA was literally an Oscar nominee before the 2020s. And Harry’s been in our lives for a decade. Hell, I saw Dua live twice before the pandemic hit.

This is too general, it’s Tik Tok that ruined the music industry. Most artists nowadays are no longer paying attention on releasing solid albums, they just go for little quick hits with cheap sound just for Tik Tok trend. Taylor has pointed this before lol. In adfition, I think Bebe? or Halsey maybe I forgot which pop girlies exposed how her label forced her to keep releasing singles and see what stick with the public otherwise they will scrap the album project. And it’s a shame that I have to admit even we start accepting this reality, I mean for example Beautiful Things is smashing and somehow we all agree that Bensoon should release an album although we all know that he’s not ready. The new pop stars of the 2020s have hits but the parent albums failed to deliver (with exception of Olivia) which is why they are pale in comparison with 2010s.
Sexy, confident. So intelligent.
She is heaven-sent. So soft, so strong.

I also feel like not owning the physical media makes today’s stars much more disposable. It’s no accident that Taylor is the biggest star in the world, and is selling massive amounts of actual physical product.

Honey, do NOT get delusional.  Lorde is the definition of an one era wonder.  Homegirl bombed after her first album.
Coachella’s impact is so overstated. it’s not that artists don’t benefit from it, but the benefits are not nearly enough to plan a whole album campaign based on it

Tell that to the artist whose album flopped after turning down a headlining slot that would’ve been 2 weeks before her release date. 
Overstated? Sure
Still valuable? Definitely
It sure as hell didn’t hurt Sabrina debuting “Espresso” there

Coachella would not have helped massively. like i said, it’s really not worth artists going out of their way to do it if it doesn’t allign with their plans
‘Espresso’ was gonna be a massive hit regardless
