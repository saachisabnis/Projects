Charli XCX is ensuring that Brat summer extends into Brat fall. The pop star just revealed an impressive array of guest stars who will feature on her upcoming remix album, Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat, which is set to drop on October 11. Charli will be joined on these new remixes by Ariana Grande, Tinashe, the 1975, Bon Iver, BB Trickz, the Japanese House, Julian Casablancas, Bladee, Caroline Polachek, Jon Hopkins, and Shygirl. Charli’s promotional team teased the various guest stars involved in the project by putting up neon ‘brat green’ billboards in various cities around the world featuring the names of the artists written in backwards text. The Brat remix album arrives while Charli is currently on her co-headlining Sweat Tour with Troye Sivan, which is set to hit up Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland over the coming weeks, before wrapping up in Seattle on October 23.
