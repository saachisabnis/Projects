	With eight nominations, Royel Otis is all set to reign at the 2024 ARIA Awards.

	The Sydney-formed indie act bags nods for album of the year, best group, best independent release, best rock album, best Australian live act and more, following their debut full-length album release, Pratts & Pain, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Chart.

	Royel Otis has been in sparkling form heading into the ARIAs. Led by Royel Maddell and Otis Pavlovic, and developed by Ourness, the music company behind Genesis Owusu, Royel Otis made their debut on the Billboard Hot 100 with a cover of The Cranberries’ “Linger” reaching No. 94, and impacted Billboard’s Alternative Airplay chart with another cover, hitting No. 2 with their rendition of Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s “Murder On The Dancefloor,” which they covered for triple j’s Like A Version.
