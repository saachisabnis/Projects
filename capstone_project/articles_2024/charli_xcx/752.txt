WASHINGTON (TND) — Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday launched her own TikTok account, just months after President Joe Biden backed a potential ban of the app.
Harris appears to be off to a strong start in popularity with young voters following a proliferation of memes poking fun at her infamous “coconut tree” remark and her affinity for popular singer Charli XCX. In a short clip shared to her new TikTok profile, Harris explained her decision to join the app is due in part to this popularity.
The clip has earned over 2 million likes and over 9 million views. The account also quickly rocketed to 1.5 million followers overnight. Harris’s account is separate from her campaign profile KamalaHQ, which appears to be run by staffers.
TikTok has proven to be a controversial topic among politicians. President Joe Biden in April signed a measure giving Chinese parent company ByteDance nine months to sell the platform or face a nationwide ban.
Former President Trump in 2020 also opposed the app and signed an executive order to ban it. Despite this, Trump also launched his own TikTok account in June.

Harris, now a presidential contender, is seeking to make up Biden’s lost ground with young voters. A poll from Axios and Generation Lab released Thursday shows Harris with a 20-point lead among 18 to 34-year-olds.
Resurfaced video of Harris appearing to call young voters “stupid” went viral on social media this week, earning thousands of views on TikTok. The remark was widely fact-checked in 2020 when Harris rose to prominence as Biden’s running mate. Both USA Today and Reuters said video circulating social media that year was “missing context.”
