Charli XCX’s Brat Wall may be gone, but Brat summer is everlasting. The latest person to get in on the drug-addled haze fun is Billie Eilish in her first-ever feature. A remix of Brat bonus track “Guess” drops at 6 p.m. ET on August 1. Charli first teased Eilish’s involvement on social media on July 31, promising a remix alongside a faceless boxer wearer. Turns out? It’s our favorite Chingy impersonator! The cover is in black and white because even though we know it’s Eilish, we still have to guess the color of her underwear.

“Hey, Billie, you there?” Charli asks in her very chic British accent. The teaser ends with Eilish’s trademark giggle. For what it’s worth, we hope the underwear is Billie Eilish root green.
