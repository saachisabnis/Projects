"Omg I’m dead"
Charli XCX has responded to Pulp frontman Jarvis Cover playing her track ‘Girl, So Confusing’ remix during his Glastonbury DJ set.
The ‘Common People’ singer took over the Stonebridge Bar in the Park on Friday (June 28) where he played a DJ set with Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip. During the set, Charli’s remix of her ‘Brat‘ track ‘Girl, So Confusing’ featuring Lorde was played.
Charli commented on a TikTok of the song being spun by Cocker to which she commented: “Omg I’m dead.” Fans took to the comment section to express their excitement. “The way I would have gone insane if I’d been there,” wrote one user while another shared: “This is me in a video”.

A fan took to X/Tweet: “Charli and jarvis collab WHEN PLZ” which as over 3.6k views and 1.8k likes. Upon releasing the remix, XCX fans went insane over the collaboration with Lorde especially those who have been cognizant about the duo’s relationship through the years – to them, the original ‘Girl, so confusing’ song had seemed to heavily allude to it.
Charli previously opened up about her relationship with Lorde, admitting to being “super jealous” of Lorde’s success when she was younger: “She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick. You create these parallels and think, ‘Well, that could have been me.’ But it couldn’t have because we’re completely different people.”
The inclusion of Lorde’s feature has added a whole new dimension to the song for fans – many reacted to her confessional verse as a deeply resonant look into the complications of female friendships, while some were moved by the ‘Melodrama’ artist singing openly about living with anorexia.
Elsewhere at Glastonbury, Charli took to the Levels stage for ‘Charli XCX Presents Partygirl’, where she brought out special guests Romy and Robyn for a performance of ‘With Every Heartbeat’ and a remix of ‘Dancing On My Own’.
Fans took to social media to share frustration that her set wasn’t available to watch, with one fan saying: “how in the name of brat summer was charli xcx on a non televised stage at Glastonbury 😭😭😭”
Others were quick to point at the capacity of the venue, which, although in keeping with Charli’s DJ roots, is capped at only 7,000 – joking: “It’s actually BRAT to not get into the Charli XCX DJ set at Glasto.”
In a four-star review of ‘Brat’, NME wrote: “It all paints a picture of who XCX is in 2024.
“Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”. With ‘Brat’, XCX demonstrates that going her own way will always sound pretty good.”
