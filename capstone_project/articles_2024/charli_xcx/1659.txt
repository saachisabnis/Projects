Reese Witherspoon attended WSJ Magazine’s 2024 Innovator Awards held yesterday in New York. The thespian was accompanied by her 21-year-old son Deacon Phillippe, whom she shares with ex husband Ryan Phillippe.
This year, the magazine celebrated seven revolutionary icons in recognition of their outstanding achievements in their respective fields. These icons included big names from fashion to film and sports including Charli XCX, Marc Jacobs and Salma Hayek, among others. Hayek received the Entertainment & Altruism Award from her friend Penélope Cruz.

 









The “Cruel Intentions” star was teal carpet-ready in a pair of glossy black heels. The style incorporated high-shine patent leather uppers in a jet-black hue accompanied by pointed toes and thin ankle straps threaded through adjustable buckle closures.

2 to 3-inch stiletto heels rounded out the set, offering Witherspoon a subtle boost in height, creating the illusion of length. The shoe is pretty simple in construction, however, the ankle straps act to revamp the silhouette, creating dimension. Similar styles to the actress’ shoe pick can be purchased from brands like Alaia, Zara, Nine West, Christian Louboutin and Pleaser, among others. Meanwhile, Phillippe matched his mom’s black leather aesthetic in a pair of loafers.
Updating the little black dress, Witherspoon donned a midi-length style featuring an asymmetric neckline, a form fit and flattering ruched detailing on the skirt. As for accessories, the “Sing” star sported gold jewelry, livening up her look. The LBD is a staple in many celebrities’ wardrobes. While the piece can be a bit overdone, actresses tend to gravitate toward little black dresses with unique details that act to revamp the classic construction.
For footwear, Witherspoon’s pairs often follow the simple route to complement her colorful attire. On the red carpet, the Hello Sunshine founder regularly slips on neutral and jewel-toned heels from Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Gianvito Rossi. 
When off-duty, she can be spotted in low-top leather or athletic sneakers by Common Projects, Veja and Hoka One One. The star’s also a fashion leader in her own right, launching her Draper James brand in 2015.
