It seems Taylor Swift started cheering for Travis Kelce at Kansas City Chiefs games long before anyone knew. Chiefs defense backs coach Dave Merritt said she was showing up privately at first in an interview on The Sports Shop with Reese and K-Mac podcast. “When she started to come around, it was privately. She was coming into the stadiums without people really knowing until the camera put a big spotlight on it,” Merritt said. “She actually affected the team in a positive way. It wasn’t a negative way. Everybody was excited that Travis was happy.”
