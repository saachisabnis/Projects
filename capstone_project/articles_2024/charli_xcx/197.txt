Charli XCX took a page out of PinkPantheress’s book: she performed with a chic little handbag clutched against her ribs. I would be shocked if you haven’t heard, but Charli XCX was this weekend’s host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live. It’s SNL’s 50th season, and they’ve been celebrating the hell out of it, booking icons left and right. But the streets are saying Charli’s episode is the best of the season. 
You could definitely say it’s very brat, very 365 party girl to perform with a handbag on stage. It’s kind of rude, it implies that she won’t be staying long enough to really see a need to put it down. It’s casual, without presentation. Like she’s chilling. Did you think this performance was a big deal? She’s just talking on the mic. But of course, everything brat is a performance of that vibe. That nonplussed energy that is actually, in fact, very much plussed. The bag she wore was a Gucci Jackie bag, named after Jackie O., who loved it. We can’t pretend Charli hasn’t been totally waiting for this moment her whole career, but acting too cool about it is who she is, and we love that about her. The Jackie bag itself, I would argue is cool and brat. It’s a really unfussy, low maintenance shoulder bag with not a lot going on. It doesn’t require much of you, and it doesn’t insist upon itself. As far as Gucci goes, it’s also quite low key and humble looking.

The style of bag is actually really popular, so you can get something similar too. Coach carries a really cute one that’s a fraction of the price.
