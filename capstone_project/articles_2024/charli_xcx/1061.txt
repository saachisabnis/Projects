Matty Healy has regrets over his recent feud with Azealia Banks on social media.
“What a bad day, I really let myself down,” the 1975 frontman, 35, wrote via Reddit on Thursday, December 5. “I have worked so hard to move past these impulsive self-destructive and honestly quite volatile outbursts I have.”
Healy admitted that he’s “constantly making trouble” for himself especially when he returns to social media after having “depressive episodes.” The musician noted that his mental health struggles should not be an “excuse” for how he acts online — especially towards others.
“I just feel dreadful about how I acted violent — I think Azealia and all obvious, flawed people all deep down have a heart and I hate that I have contributed to her mental fragility. She’s a human,” he continued. “This cultural discourse has become so violent in general. I don’t wanna act like I regret who I am or who have been. But Tbh at this point I feel gross even having said anything negative ever about anything — if it’s contributed to this culture.”
Healy shared that he wasn’t making this statement because he felt “bullied and scared” about his outburst. Instead, he wanted to acknowledge that he messed up.
“I’m embarrassed man. And I’m sad,” he penned. “And I want this 1975 world to be dreamy and wonderful again. Not some Black Mirror episode about being a f—ing hipster. I hope to put as much work into our need and desire for altruism and understanding and love as I have about the dangers of becoming an internet lunatic.”
Healy wrote that it was “time to move on” and he wanted to send his fans “love.” Many 1975 fans took to the comments section to voice their support for Healy and applauded him for taking accountability.
“Mate, you’re human. You admit your flaws. You’re sound,” one user replied. “You’re a damned sight more self-aware than most, and we respect and appreciate you for it.”
Healy was seemingly touched by the group’s response and commented on his post, “You guys rock.”
Earlier this week, Healy made headlines after he slammed Banks, 33, after she made remarks about his friend, Charli XCX’s appearance. (Charli, 32, is also engaged to Healy’s bandmate, George Daniel.)
“Azealia you seem to have a blind spot when it comes to your ‘reads’. All the women you attack seem to be culturally relevant, attractive, divisive and NICE people,” Healy wrote via X on Tuesday, December 3. “I think this makes you jealous cos you’re so talented but everything else about you is a failure. Just rap bro.”
After coming to Charli’s defense, the beef between Banks and Healy didn’t stop there.
“That wasn’t a read. I’ve known Charli since she was 16 and always thought she was absolutely gorgeous, but there’s a stark contrast between this and this,” Banks retorted via X on Tuesday alongside two pics comparing the Brat artist’s looks from 2014 to now.
After Banks’ response, the exchange between the twosome got even more heated. Banks then wrote that Healy’s fiancée, Gabbriette Bechtel, looks “like Frankenstein” — which led Healy to fight back.
“I’ll f—ing slap you so hard I’ll get a Guinness world record for the highest a rat some b—h calls a wig has ever flown,” Healy wrote at the time in a since-deleted tweet per multiple outlets.
Healy deleted the threatening tweet and subsequently apologized.

“Nah I can’t be saying I’m gonna hit a girl that’s insane I’m sorry,” he wrote via X. “You just can’t keep being so mean about my mates and my mrs it’s really hurtful gets me well defensive.”
Healy has since deactivated his account. Banks, for her part, was not impressed with Healy’s Reddit apology.
“The point of it all …. that really makes it a non apology… was Matt Healy apologizing for himself publicly, and not having enough respect to apologize to ME just as publicly,” she wrote via X on Thursday. “Clearly you can understand how this situation is bring[ing] up LOADS of PTSD, and still set up to disregard any modicum of basic respect that I deserve.”
