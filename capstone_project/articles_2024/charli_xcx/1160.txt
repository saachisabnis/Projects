The 1975 frontman Matty Healy is now engaged to Gabbriette Bechtel. The 26-year-old model shared the news of their engagement on her Instagram story. She shared a photo of her ring at a listening party for Charli XCX’s new album, Brat, in Brooklyn, which the couple attended together. Bechtel captioned her post, “MARRYING THE 1975 IS VERY BRAT,” which the 35-year-old Healy later reposted on his own account. Charlie XCX herself just got engaged to Healy’s bandmate in The 1975, drummer/producer George Daniel, back in November. Healy’s mother, Denise Welch, confirmed the engagement news on her talk show, Loose Women. “I have known for a few weeks that Matty got engaged,” she said. “Black diamond [ring], he had it made for her. I couldn’t be more thrilled. We couldn’t be happier — she is everything I would want in a daughter-in-law.” (Billboard)
