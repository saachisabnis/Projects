Megan Thee Stallion performed two songs at an Atlanta rally for Kamala Harris Tuesday night. She walked on stage in a blue suit and declared that the Hotties were for Harris, before jumping into radio safe versions of “Body” and “Mamushi.” Meg also performed the viral “Mamushi” dance on TikTok in her full presidential fit. The artist connected “Body” to women’s bodily autonomy, one of the main issues in this election. “I know my ladies in the crowd love their body,” she said. “And if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.” Quavo also appeared at the Atlanta rally, speaking out on Harris’ commitment to gun safety. “You can’t understand the struggle of gun violence if you not in the field or in the heart of it,” he said, alluding to the loss of Takeoff to gun violence in 2022. “So, one thing I learned from working with Vice President Harris is she always stand on business. From inviting me to the White House last year to discuss these solutions, to passing the biggest gun safety laws today.”

Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo are two of many artists who have gone coconuts for the presumed Democratic presidential nominee. Charli XCX famously declared that “kamala IS brat,” and Beyoncé approved the Harris campaign to use “Freedom” in her campaign ads, and when news broke that Biden had dropped out, Cardi B tweeted “AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate…..STOP FCKIN PLAYIN WITH ME !!!!!!!”

And before either Harris or Megan appeared at the Atlanta rally, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” was played for attendees. It’s not clear, however, if that song selection is indicative of Kendrick being Team Kamala OR Kamala being Team Kendrick.
