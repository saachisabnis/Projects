Because you’re about to! Ingrid Andress (“4-time Grammy losing singer songwriter,” according to her IG bio) sang the national anthem at the 2024 Home Run Derby on July 15, and from sea to shining sea, people were not impressed. The day after, Andress addressed the performance herself.
Ingrid Andress is a country singer-songwriter. Her breakthrough single was 2019’s “More Hearts Than Mine”; it hit Billboard’s “The Hot 100” and peaked at No. 30. In 2021, she collaborated with Sam Hunt on “Wishful Drinking,” which also hit “The Hot 100.”
Regarding those four Grammy nominations: In 2021, she was nominated for Best New Artist, and “More Hearts Than Mine” (she lost to Megan Thee Stallion) and its album were nom’ed for Best Country Song and Best Country Album. In 2023, “Wishful Drinking” got the nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.
Listen for yourself.

Andress admitted that she “was drunk” and would be checking into rehab. “That was not me last night,” she wrote on social media. “I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition. I’ll let y’all know how rehab is I hear it’s super fun.” Andress’s next show, at Row One in Nashville on July 17, is no longer listed on the venue’s website. Her new single, “Colorado 9,” still appears to be set for release on July 24.

I mean, not that bad. Roseanne Barr definitely got more flak for her 1990 rendition. And Fergie made bigger swings at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game.
Also, that song is too hard! The national anthem is an annoyingly difficult song, for its ubiquity. The range you need for it is psycho, and when sung a cappella, it’s that much harder. Andress may have irked people with her cursive-style singing and lack of support on some of those big flourishes.
Even if you don’t know the term, you know the vibe. That way people wayrm theyre vowayals and add a lot of vocal fry. When Camila Cabello was home for Quismoiss? That was cursive.
To paraphrase a French clowning instructor, a little cursive singing is okay, but a lot is more difficult. Plus she should take a page out of Charli XCX’s book re singing live.
Okay, first of all, Andress co-wrote underrated Charli banger “Boys,” so it’s more germane that you think. But here’s the tea: In a recent interview promoting brat, Charli XCX said, “I drink and I smoke and I use AutoTune.” Charli has been using AutoTune live for years, and there’s no shame in that. There’s so much software available now that no one needs to ever sound bad live ever again.
Yes, according to Matt Rogers. She’s a shoo-in to headline WeHo Pride next year.
See, that’s what I thought, but those are actually a little shorter. Can you imagine, though?
