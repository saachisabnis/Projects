Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon initially reached out to Bonnie Raitt to see if he could clear a sample of her 1989 classic, “Nick of Time,” for Charli XCX’s remix of Brat’s emotional standout, “I Think About It All The Time.” And between Charli introducing a new generation to Raitt, and Maggie Rogers honoring her by affectionately covering “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” the music legend is clearly experiencing a “Raittaisance.” “I’m just a working musician,” Raitt says. “But it’s been a remarkable blooming time for me.” That includes her winning Song of the Year at the 2023 Grammys for “Just Like That,” over music luminaries Taylor Swift, Lizzo, Adele, Harry Styles, and Beyoncé. As for what Raitt thinks of Charli’s use of her song? “It’s hard to know exactly which parts they used,” she says. “It mostly sounds like her, but it has a different tone to it, and I know there’s one isolated part of my voice. But they did a really artful job — I was very honored.” (Rolling Stone)
