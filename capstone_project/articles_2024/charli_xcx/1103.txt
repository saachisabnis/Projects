1) Bruno has always been powered by the public, hence moderate debuts but growth, stability & ubiquity. 
2) If you need hourly chart updates, distorted stats, notional snobbery and circular arguments, you know which fandom to engage. 
3) I hate mainstream Pop and would rather Bruno do something else, even at some commercial expense. 
4) I’m here to discuss my secondary interests with other enthusiasts, enjoy it, and maybe expand my network. 
5) Fuck unnecessary competition over artists who don’t know me.
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.

He’s done pop, rnb, soul, funk, reggae, hooks in Rap. What else is he gonna do? Maybe dance or country lol. I’m actually curious, cause returning to pop makes more sense. At least he’d be getting the numbers!
You asked for it, creating vision boards for anything is my guilty pleasure!
Genre:
Indie Pop + Folk Rock. 
Examples:

Reasons:
– Allows deeper writing while retaining commercial appeal.

5) Go Your Way (Fleetwood Mac) (play the end!)
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.
I was about to ask if you took ADHD meds lol, but it turned out to be an interesting read. I actually pictured Bruno’s voice over Riptide, went so well.
Can I order a vision board for  Adele’s? 👀
Just listened to Disease. I personally love it, but I don’t know how it’ll do Grammys-wise because it’s definitely very avant-garde. Plus obviously we won’t know how it does streaming-wise for a little bit. I’m excited about this upcoming era for Gaga though. This is a strong start 
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time”
sounds like she recorded it like 13 years ago, back when she was popular solo.
I don’t expect this new Gaga song to do much on the charts in the long run. I’ll keep an open mind that she’s holding her A-material for closer to the release date 
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
The first major competitor of the season has emerged tonight, and it’s a BIG one. Disease is phenomenal,  Best Pop song I’ve heard in 2024 so far. Congratulations, Gaga, on your potential ROTY, SOTY & Pop Solo or Pop Dance Performance nominations. 👏🏻
but I don’t know how it’ll do Grammys-wise because it’s definitely very avant-garde.

I respect her for not going the easy route. Coming off Die With a Smile, she could’ve gone completely vanilla, so her showing goth influences was a surprise. I hear some Gesaffelstein elements in there (surprised he didn’t produce it), even a little bit of Depeche Mode.
But yeah, I doubt it’ll be much of a pop smash, but clearly that’s not what she’s aiming for.

I doubt it’ll get anything but Halsey did her big one with The Great Impersonator. Keeps getting better with each release!
Sorry but diseases have no place in pop solo or pop dance, this song is fitting better in best electronic dance music record and if the committee accepted break my soul they have the logic and honor to accept disease too.
My opinion about the song. A great song, one of her best leads, easily. Maybe it won’t explode commercially, but that doesn’t matter. The song is good. I was really afraid it would be bad because Perfect Illusion is mid-range and Stupid Love is ATROCIOUS, but Disease is GREAT.

Break My Soul is the reason the Dance Pop category was created, and is why Charli XCX isn’t competing in the Dance Electronic Recording category. Disease is a midtempo 100 bpm track, so it would be sent to Pop Solo as it’s not upbeat enough to qualify as Dance Pop.

Disease is that girl
FYC: Leash by Sky Ferreira from the motion picture Babygirl
It’s Gaga best least single since Born this way! I don’t think it’s a song for the charts tho, but the album sounds so so promising! She’s back
not feeling the new Gaga. it’s not bad, just underwhelming. unfortunately i haven’t enjoyed a solo Gaga single in a long time
it’ll get a dance pop nomination if it goes there and that’s it, i imagine
