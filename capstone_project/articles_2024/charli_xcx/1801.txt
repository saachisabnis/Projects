Bumpin’ that!
Charli XCX is having one hell of a summer. The entire world, in an unprecedented turn of events, is obsessed with Brat. The new Charli XCX album Brat went from being a hyped record for her diehard angels and music nerds to becoming a pop culture phenomenon that has been consistently viral since it dropped and hasn’t left charts or hearts since. It’s her biggest commercial success in her entire career – wild for a record coming straight after Crash, which was Charli’s attempt to “sell out” and chase big hits and chart fame after a career where she’s always toed the line between edgy underdog and household name. But how much has this mass ascension to pop culture icon has Charli XCX actually been making in royalties from her music this BRAT summer and every summer going forward? Thankfully, Billboard has done some estimated calculations.
So, Charli has opened up about royalties across her career in a new interview with Billboard discussing all things Brat. If you didn’t know, publishing royalties are what is paid out to artists and songwriters credited on music for streams and sales, all that stuff. Charli XCX makes money not only off her own songs for her songwriting and performing, but the work she’s done for other artists pre Brat. She’s a prolific songwriter and is behind some huge hits for other artists, like the work she did writing Señorita for Shaun Mendes and Camila Cabello and Same Old Love for Selena Gomez.

When talking about royalties she would earn for her hit song last year from the Barbie soundtrack, Speed Drive, Charli told Billboard that because Speed Drive has interpolations of Cobrastyle by Robyn and Hey Mickey, the royalties aren’t much because of how many writers need to be credited. “There are now like 25 writers listed on it or something, which really sucks for us… though I don’t really make much money from publishing anyway,” Charli says.
When it comes to how much Charli XCX is making in royalties in general, including now Brat going forward, Billboard has estimated that annually the pop icon rakes in between $500,000 and $900,000 from her full catalogue and what she’s done for others.
Obviously, this isn’t all she’s making. That figure doesn’t factor in anything Charli will earn from touring and merch – don’t forget she’s currently selling a Brat towel for £50. And you know full well twinks across the globe are opening their purses to buy that.
