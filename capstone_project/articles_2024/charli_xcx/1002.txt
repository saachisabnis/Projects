Bill Burr will host Saturday Night Live for the second time on November 9th for the post-Election Day episode. The comedian will be joined by first-time musical guest Mk.gee. Charli XCX will then pull double-duty as both host and musical guest on November 16th. It’s her first time as host, but third time performing. The long-standing sketch show, now in its 50th season, was off last weekend but returns tomorrow with John Mulaney and Chappell Roan. The season premiere in September earned 5.3 million views, the most for an SNL season premiere in four years. (Variety)
