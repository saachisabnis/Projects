As the air gets chillier and the leaves get increasingly more crisp, it's time to prepare for some classic fall fun.
The humble apple is at the core of many fall festivities, and visiting a local apple orchard is the perfect activity for families, couples, and friend groups alike. 
Before you make a beeline for the nearest apple tree, you'll want to grab a basket, ladder and your coziest cardigan for this fruitful venture.
While you're at it, take some sweet snaps while you're enjoying all of that wholesome fall fun. Naturally, you'll want to show off your adventure on social media, so we've got you covered with the best apple picking captions of the bunch.
Whether you choose a classic apple pun or a trendy song lyric, your friends will be as green as a Granny Smith with envy when they get wind of your weekend plans.
Even after you've left the orchard, there's still more fun to be had. Turn your bushel of hand-picked apples into delicious fall treats like apple cobbler, caramel apple cheesecake, and of course, a classic American apple pie.
These adorable apple picking captions are the perfect way to celebrate a crisp fall day.
