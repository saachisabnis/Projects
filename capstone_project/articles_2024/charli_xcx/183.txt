In a new video interview with Variety, Charli XCX disclosed that she suffers nerve damage due to her intense performances, and that touring takes a mental and physical toll on the 32-year-old pop superstar. “I find touring really hard emotionally,” Charli shared. “I find the stage — especially these days — to be a very angry place for me. I’ve done a lot of physical damage to my body from performing, and I’m often in a lot of pain when I perform. Physically, I have nerve damage in my neck from things I’ve done on the stage.” Charli just finished up a short run of U.K. arena shows supporting her Grammy-nominated Brat album, and earlier this year played a co-headlining series of sold-out shows in North America with Troye Sivan as part of their Sweat Tour. Charli said those shows with her friend/collaborator were “a lot easier and less of an emotional battle for me.” Touring still feels like “kind of this hellhole” Charli admits, “but being with Troye softens that a lot.” (Billboard)
