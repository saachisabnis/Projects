Viral moments from the singer’s ‘Short N’ Sweet’ tour are being recreated in the game

A number of Roblox Dress To Impress fans are taking inspiration from Sabrina Carpenter and her ‘Short N’ Sweet’ tour.
Dress To Impress is a Roblox game that challenges players to pull together iconic looks before parading them down the runway. A special, Charli XCX-inspired update launched earlier this year in celebration of ‘Brat’ Summer but pop fans are now taking things into their own hands.
Sabrina Carpenter kicked off her massive, ambitious arena tour for new album ‘Short N’ Sweet’ last month, with the show featuring unique covers, an impressive production and a whole lot of sequins. “Me on the Dress To Impress runway,” wrote one fan on social media, alongside an image of Carpenter onstage.
Replying to the viral Tweet, others shared their Carpenter-inspired Dress To Impress looks.

Speaking about her onstage outfits and choreography, Sabrina Carpenter recently admitted that “you’ll still get the occasional mother that has a strong opinion on how you should be dressing.”
“And to that I just say, don’t come to the show and that’s OK,” she continued. “It’s unfortunate that it’s ever been something to criticise, because truthfully, the scariest thing in the world is getting up on a stage in front of that many people and having to perform as if it’s nothing. If the one thing that helps you do that is the way you feel comfortable dressing, then that’s what you’ve got to do.”
“My fans online are like, ‘I can’t believe she’s bending over in front of her grandparents’. I’m like, girl, they are not paying attention to that,” she continued. “They’re just like, ‘I can’t believe all these people are here’.”
Sabrina Carpenter’s North American ‘Short N’ Sweet’ tour is set to run until November 15, before the UK and European leg kicks off March 2025. Meanwhile, Dress To Impress is set to receive a halloween update in the coming weeks.
In other news, Halo fans have taken to social media to complain about the updated look of Master Chief in new game footage.
