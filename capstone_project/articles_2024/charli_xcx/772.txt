A. G. Cook is kicking off 2024 with a 10-minute new song. Find “Silver Thread Golden Needle,” along with a visualizer directed by Lena Weber and Aaron Chan, below.
Last year, the PC Music founder teamed up with Easyfun for the debut Thy Slaughter album. The full-length, Soft Rock, has contributions from Caroline Polachek, Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, Charli XCX, Alaska Reid, and the late SOPHIE.
Cook has said that 2023 would be the final year of new releases for PC Music, which he founded in 2013. The label will be dedicated to archival projects and special reissues going forward, he said.
