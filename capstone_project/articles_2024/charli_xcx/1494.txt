Violet Grohl has made a name for herself by performing with her dad and the Foo Fighters, and now it looks like Dave Grohl's eldest daughter is ready to step into her own spotlight. According to Hollywood Reporter, Violet has been working on her debut album.
A source close to the 18-year-old singer told the outlet that she is “incredibly committed” to the music-making process and “to growing as an artist." Dave reportedly gifted Violet the studio space for her birthday, and she's working with producer Justin Raisen (Kim Gordon, Charli XCX, Sky Ferreira).
“She’s a true torch singer,” a source said. “Her vocals are tremendous. She’s very talented.”
Although Violet's reportedly working on an album, no details have been confirmed.
Violet first took the stage with her father to perform Adele's "When We Were Young" when she was 12 years old. In the years since, she's toured with the Foo Fighters as a backing singer; released a cover of X's "Nausea" with her dad; performed at charity events; sang at Taylor Hawkins' tribute concert; and most recently joined David Bowie pianist Mike Garson to cover Bowie songs and duet with her dad on a Nirvana classic and newer Foo Fighters song.
