The Vice President’s campaign has been leaning into the memes, but the strategy doesn’t guarantee turnout
Kamala Harris
Vice President Kamala Harris’ sudden candidacy for president inspired an explosion of memes across TikTok, Instagram and X, delivering priceless publicity in the short months before the election. So far, her campaign has winked at the internet’s inside jokes in its own messaging, hoping exuberance will translate into votes.
The strategy — which involves referencing coconuts and playing with the lime green “Brat” aesthetic of pop singer Charli XCX’s viral album — is risky, experts said. Leaning too hard into a meme can drain its fun, alienate people who don’t get it, or distract from the more important messages on policy and the seriousness of voting. But Harris needs all the attention she can get.
