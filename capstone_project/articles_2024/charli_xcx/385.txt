The artist's teeny tiny thong was on full display ðŸ‘€
It's safe to say 2024 has been Charli XCX's year. The artist took over the collective consciousness this summer thanks to her viral Brat Girl aesthetic, but she's definitely not slowing down now we're well into the depths of winter. Sure, white cropped tank tops and minuscule hotpants may not be seasonally appropriate attire, even when worn under our winter coats and with fleece-lined tights. However, Charli's latest 'fit is simultaneously party szn perfection while being *so* Brat-coded.
The artist attended the LA premiere of horror film, Nosferatu last night [Thursday 12 December], though there was nothing scary about her look. Walking the spooky black carpet alongside the film's cast including Emma Corrin, Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Charli stood out in an elegant AF black knee-length dress.
Despite appearing at first glance to be relatively demure in design, the dress prompted a double-take as it was almost entirely see-through.
The slip silhouette featured a satin cowl neckline and asymmetric hemline separated by a sheer swathe of fabric decorated with black velvet embroidery in a floral motif print. The transparent nature of the design revealed that Charli was going braless in the dress, wearing just a teeny tiny black thong underneath that was on full display. Black slingback heels completed the overall ensemble that put a naked twist on an elegant LBD. 
This latest look follows a fashion formula Charli seems to have recently adopted. Attending the Variety Hitmakers Brunch earlier this month on 7 December, Charli repped a subtly sheer brown halterneck dress that freed the nip while nailing the season's biggest colour trend. So here for a wardrobe that works smarter, not harder.
