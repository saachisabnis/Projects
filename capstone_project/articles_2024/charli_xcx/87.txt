Charli XCX and The 1975's Matty Healy have a close relationship since the pop star got engaged to his bandmate George Daniel. The band was recently confirmed as a special guest on Charli's brat remix album, and during a new interview she spoke about how she considers Healy to be like a brother to her — a brother she "sometimes [wants] to strangle."
“I really wanted him to do the song. He’s like my brother now, you know?” she explained. “And I hope he wouldn’t mind me saying this but I have an endless amount of respect for him as a songwriter and him as a person. But I sometimes want to strangle him.”
“Even before being with George – years and years ago – I’ve always been such a fan of their work," Charli continued. "His thinking of the way everything is digested in terms of their work, their artwork, their font, their videos, their everything… it’s very, very holistic."
Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat drops on Friday (October 11) and also features collabs with  Robyn & Yung Lean, BB trickz, Ariana Grande, Jon Hopkins, Troye Sivan, Addison Rae, Caroline Polachek, Bladee, A.G.
