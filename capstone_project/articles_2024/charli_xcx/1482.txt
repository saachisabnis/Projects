We’re used to having music of all sorts playing in the metro area on any given weekend — or any given day, really.
But not so much Klezmer.
The Eastern European mish-mash of styles that dates back centuries and came to the U.S. during the early 20th century has enjoyed something of a global revival, but Alan Posner — director of bands at Bloomfield Hills High School and a member of the group Klezundheit — felt Michigan was missing the mark. “There was no big festival,” he explains. “We wanted to bring a group of people together to chat and spread the joy and love of Klezmer. What better way to do that than a Klezmer festival?”
KlezMitten, Michigan’s inaugural Klezmer festival, takes place from 3-7 p.m. Sunday, Sept 15, at the International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit, 111 E. Kirby St., Detroit.
Klezundheit will be joined by three other bands — Klezmephonic and Schmaltz from Ann Arbor, and Heartland Klezmorim from Lansing. Posner is excited to offer a concentrated dose of the tradition and he’s confident the exposure will bring new converts into the Klezmer realm.
“It’s a very soulful, joyous music,” Posner says. “There’s a certain rhythm to it, and chords and a tonality that we use that you don’t really find in other music. It has its roots in a lot of things that speaks to all people in a soulful, energetic way.”
