Dua Lipa bumped into her parents at a notoriously raunchy nightclub.
The star, 28, revealed the New York encounter with mum Anesa and manager dad Dukagjin, as she hosted Saturday Night Live in the US. At the weekend, she joked: “One night, I was out with my friends and we ended up at the club at 3am, and who do I bump into? My parents. It was embarrassing because the last thing you want to see when you’re super high and drunk off your arse is your daughter.”
Dua and singer Charli XCX met the pair, who are “pretty cool and love to party”, at The Box club. She added: “They let me move from Kosovo to London to start my career and now my third album just dropped.”
Her parents laughed along in the audience as she played a culture critic on a morning show, plus a nurse. She also sang. Dua joked at claims she jets off a lot, saying: “There are people who say, ‘Dua Lipa’s always on vacation’, which is wrong because I’m British and we call it a holiday.”
