Apple Music named Billie Eilish Artist of the Year for 2024 on Thursday. That makes her the first artist to receive the honor twice. The 22-year-old singer-songwriter previously won the inaugural award in 2019.
“Since day one, Apple Music has supported my music and artistry, and I am both honored and humbled to receive this recognition as Artist of the Year this many years into my career,” Eilish said.
Apple Music listed plenty of reasons for honoring Eilish a second time after her 2019 win and performance at the Apple Music Awards. Her remarkable year in 2024 began with critical acclaim for her contribution to the soundtrack for the hit film Barbie. The song “What Was I Made For?” earned her a second Academy Award and two additional Grammy Awards. That further cemented her status as one of music’s most decorated young artists.
“From ‘Ocean Eyes’ nearly a decade ago to today, we’ve witnessed Billie’s extraordinary evolution,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of Content and Editorial. “What’s truly remarkable is how she’s maintained her artistic integrity while expanding her reach, developing on her own terms and in her own distinctive way.”
The release of her third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, marked a significant artistic leap forward. The album, praised for its bold yet vulnerable approach, showcased Eilish’s maturation as an artist. And it topped Apple Music’s all-genre albums chart in an impressive 138 countries worldwide.
In addition, her influence extended beyond the recording studio to the global stage. She delivered a memorable performance of  “Birds of a Feather” at the Olympic summer games’ closing ceremony, representing her hometown of Los Angeles. The performance generated her highest single-day Shazam volume to date. Eilish also collaborated with Charli XCX on “Guess.” The track became one of the summer’s biggest hits.
Currently, Eilish headlines the sold-out Hit Me Hard and Soft tour, which continues into 2025. Seven new Grammy nominations, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year, further recognize her accomplishments.
The recognition comes as Eilish’s debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, continues to influence the industry. It listed at No. 30 on Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums list from May 2024. Fans can celebrate her Artist of the Year win by exploring Eilish’s entire catalog in Spatial Audio on Apple Music.
