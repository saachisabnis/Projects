Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions: Dance Field
Charli is more competitive in Best Dance/Electronic Album than in Best Dance Pop Recording. The latter has been taken over by A-listers.
I forgot about Bey and Billie. Seems more competitive than I thought. I agree that Charli is likelier in Dance/Electronic Album and that’d probably be her sole win if any at all.
Charli xcx is not beating Beyoncé or others main pop girls in pop field. Her possible win is Best Dance/Electronic Album if she’s allowed to compete. I’m even saying she would be a lock because all pop voters would pick her over all these DJs.
“All these DJs”
That’s really down talking the amount of work hours & years that go into these albums. ESP when Charli even hired one of these producers, Gesaffelstein, who produced her the best track on her pop album. And Gamma is a better album than brat. 
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”

Honey, Charli XCX will never enter the dance album field. Kaytranada has just released a new album. She can’t with him. She’s not a DJ. Beyonce only won and entered the electronic field because there is a great fraud in this academy where there are artists that they will benefit whatever the cost
And don’t give me speeches that charli is acclaimed and that her album has 90 on metacritic. Kaytranada won the Grammy in the dance field without having any of that. I hate this fraud that the internet provides a false success based on purchased PR and charts. This has to end! I can’t stand it anymore, it’s destroying good music and true careers
What the Charli fans are hoping for, besides not stepping foot in this thread the entire damn year until a pop star appeared, is that she’ll be the most famous name and win because they think the other contenders won’t have the name recognition. 
Look, I think Charli made the best pop album of this cycle, and deserves to win Pop Vocal Album. I also think she deserves a win in Dance Pop, despite Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande having more successful songs. I also would love to see her get an AOTY nomination. In this category, do I think she made better albums than Justice, Gesaffelstein or Nia Archives? No, I do not. But I can say I’ve listened to all these albums, Kaytranada as well, and will carefully listen to Kygo, John Summit, Sofi Tukker and Zedd’s upcoming albums as well. Because I love and respect this genre, and just want to see whomever made the best work be properly awarded. And right now, in my personal opinion, the best LP in this genre for the cycle was Justice.

Jamie xx’s collaboration with Robyn is being released as a single before the end of eligibility. I wonder if it could be a Dance Pop Recording contender.
If submitted, it’s going Dance/Electronic Recording. Another great track from Jamie.

I still think he should stick with Baddie on the Floor. That song absolutely throws down

Does anyone think that its possible for madison beer to get a nomination in the dance field for make you mine? She’s a previous grammy nominee so I feel like it’s possible

She’ll submit to Dance Pop but I don’t think the song will have much recognition to people checking their ballots. If the locks are Ariana, Dua, and probably Charli, with possibility of Gaga or that Beyonce movie song that everyone forgot about, that 5th slot probably goes to Guetta, Chainsmokers, Marshmello or possibly (probably?) Zedd. I don’t see a Madison Beer song sneaking in. One of the EDM pop-friendly producers is likely getting in.

Speak of the devil, Zedd is releasing his new single featuring Bea Miller, “Out of Time”, this Friday.
For those keeping track, this Friday we have an album from Kygo, and singles from previous Grammy winners Rufus du Sol and Zedd, as well as a new one from John Summit and 8-time Grammy nominee Kaskade. Very stacked release day
