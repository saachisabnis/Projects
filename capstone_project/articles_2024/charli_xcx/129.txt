"To be on the right side of democracy, the right side of women's rights, is hugely important to me. I'm happy to help to prevent democracy from failing forever"
Charli XCX has spoken about her viral “kamala IS brat” post, and what she expected would happen after sharing those three words on X (formerly Twitter).
In a new interview with New York Magazine, the ‘Brat‘ singer opened up the post, which came following Joe Biden’s endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential race. The tweet went viral and was adopted by Harris’s campaign team, leading to a strange collision of worlds when CNN attempted to explain the concept of ‘Brat’, live on air.
“To be on the right side of democracy, the right side of women’s rights, is hugely important to me,” the singer explained. “I’m happy to help to prevent democracy from failing forever.

“I obviously knew what I was doing,” she continued, though added that she didn’t expect the immense response to the tweet. “Did I think me talking about being a messy bitch and, like, partying and needing a Bic lighter and a pack of Marlboro Lights would end up on CNN? No.”
XCX also said that she doesn’t want to be “a political artist”. “I’m not Bob Dylan, and I’ve never pretended to be. My music is not political. Everything I do in my life feeds back into my art. Everything I say, wear, think, enjoy – it all funnels back into my art. Politics doesn’t feed my art.”
Elsewhere in her chat, Charli XCX also revealed that she has been working in the studio alongside the likes of Bon Iver and Danielle Haim. Speaking to the outlet, she said that the night prior to their chat, she had spent in the studio with the ‘Skinny Love’ hitmaker and the middle sister of the Haim group.

She also revealed that a “full-length other project,” is in the works, however, she didn’t confirm if it would be a remix album. “But it’s definitely in the bratosphere, so to speak,” she said.
In a four-star review of ‘Brat’, NME wrote: “It all paints a picture of who XCX is in 2024. Growing pains, grief and aching doubts come alongside self-confidence, celebration and the knowledge of the place XCX holds in the musical landscape – indeed, she kicks off ‘360’ with the knowing: “I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference baby”.
“With ‘Brat’, XCX demonstrates that going her own way will always sound pretty good.”
