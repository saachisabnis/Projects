Speaking of Charli, Kamala Harris‘ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, reacted to her vial tweet calling the vice president a brat. “kamala IS brat,” Charli tweeted on Sunday. Ella posted the tweet to her Instagram Story, writing “@charli_xcx gets it.”
Shaboozey is back at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. His track “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is at the top of the chart again after the single became his first leader two weeks prior.
