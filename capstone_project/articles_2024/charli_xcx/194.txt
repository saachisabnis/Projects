(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter is not dead, despite false reports on social media that appears to have duped some traditional media and politicians.
The Carter Center confirmed to NewsNation that there’s been no change in Carter’s health. The 39th president, who’s currently age 99, went into hospice care last February, where he’s remained to spend time with his family, according to the Carter Center at that time.

Several media outlets fell for a false statement online which purported to be from the “Office of Jimmy Carter.”
While from afar the letter may have looked legitimate, upon closer inspection, readers would find silly (and some vulgar) language, including referring to his late wife Rosalynn as a “baddie” and “the original “brat.” The latter of which is a reference to British musician Charli XCX’s recent hit album of the same name.
Last month, Carter’s grandson Jason Carter told Southern Living magazine that there had been “really no change” in his grandfather’s health but that the elder Carter is “experiencing the world as best he can as he continues through this process.” Jason, the oldest of Carter’s 22 grandchildren, said that while his grandfather isn’t awake every day, he speaks to his family whenever he is.
Jason said that he expressed to his grandfather that he doesn’t really know how to answer when people ask how Carter is doing, to which Jason said his grandfather replied, “I don’t know, myself.”
Carter will become a centenarian on his Oct. 1 birthday.
