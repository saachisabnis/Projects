As her “brat” album continues to reign as a summer pop culture force, Charli XCX’s focus single “360” enjoys new Billboard achievements.
The song makes its first-ever appearance on the Streaming Songs chart this week, while ascending into the Top 50 on the overall Hot 100.
“360” specifically scores #38 on the 50-song Streaming Songs chart, becoming the artist’s fourth career entry. She previously charted with the Iggy Azalea collaboration “Fancy” (#1), her solo hit “Boom Clap” (#15), and her Icona Pop collaboration “I Love It” (#18).
“360” meanwhile rises eleven spots to #44 on the overall Hot 100, which accounts for radio and sales in addition to streaming. The song marks her fourth Top 50 entry on the Hot 100; the aforementioned three songs all hit the Top 10 during their runs.
