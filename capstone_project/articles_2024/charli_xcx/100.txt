Charli XCX announced on Twitter/X that brat summer was finished — and Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign agreed.
Almost immediately after President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race in late July and endorsed his running mate, Harris garnered tons of support from the pop culture crowd, including Charli XCX who declared: “Kamala is brat.” It became a favorite silly topic amongst the cable news crowd, who volunteered themselves to look like a bunch of befuddled old people trying to understand what all the kids were talking about these days. But the Harris campaign — at least their social media operation — also latched on to the neon green, lowercase branding and used it for their Twitter/X banner along with the “Kamala is brat” slogan.
But now, with the passing of Labor Day, summer is (unofficially) over, and so is brat summer, as ordered by Charli XCX herself on Monday:
goodbye forever brat summer.

That’s it. It’s done, guys.
And it’s also done for the Harris campaign, which switched its Twitter/X banner image to a screenshot of former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social rage-posting “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” during the Democratic National Convention:

So, what’s next? Everyone is already over “very demure, very mindful,” so is it going to be a “y r u obsessed with me” fall? Only time — and internet culture — will tell.
