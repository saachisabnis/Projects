Tashi Duncan would be proud 
Whether it's the football, the tennis or the impending Olympics, one thing's for certain: it's a summer of sport (catch me wearing a football shirt for the first time in my *entire* life)! 
Even if or not you're interested in playing sport or, under normal circumstances, watching it, it's hard not to get swept up in the spirit. And, it seems, our fave celebs feel the same - at least if the long list of familiar faces sitting courtside at Wimbledon is anything to go by.
So far, the likes of Margot Robbie, Charli XCX and Vick Hope have made their way down to the tennis extravaganza - and as the tournament nears its end, the fashion stakes have seriously been heating up.  
And who's just thrown her hat in the ring in the race for the best-dressed celeb at Wimbledon? None other than literal goddess and fashion icon Zendaya. 
Of course, her appearance is all the more significant given that her role in Challengers dethroned aughts rom-com Wimbledon as the best tennis film of all time (I said what I said) - and especially so when we consider that she turned up dressed *just* like her character, Tashi Duncan. 
Yep, rocking a Ralph Lauren fit (veeery grownup, quiet luxury Tashi) she rocked a preppy fit consisting of a tweed blazer, blue Oxford shirt, knitted tie and denim trousers - topped off with a pair of pearl stud earrings and a Louis Vuitton monogram bag.
She slayed (pun very much intended!) with this look.
