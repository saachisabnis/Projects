'Brat' themed billboards have cropped up across the US
Fans think Charli XCX may be teasing a 2025 North American arena tour, in celebration of her recent album ‘Brat‘.
Earlier this year, Charli embarked on the ‘Sweat’ US tour alongside Troye Sivan, and now there’s speculation that she may be returning to the continent for a string of solo shows.
The rumours follow ‘Brat’-themed billboards cropping up in cities across the US. The signs all feature the album’s signature lurid green colour as well as its lo-fi font, reading ‘Chicago’, ‘Minneapolis’ and ‘Brooklyn’, in the respective cities.
Charli teased the featured artists on the ‘Brat’ remix album, ‘Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat’, in a similar way earlier this year.
Fans on Reddit have also noticed that the ‘Club Classics’ singer’s Ticketmaster page now says there are “16 events”, yet not all of these appear currently. “Oh something is happening…..” one fan wrote, while another added: “she is so good at promotion and building hype istg.”

NME caught Charli and Sivan’s ‘Sweat’ tour and gave it a glowing five-star review. “As they wrap up the night with performances of their collaborations ‘1999’ and the ‘Talk Talk’ remix, it’s clear that they’ve both not just mastered their craft but are now getting the recognition they deserve. ‘Brat’ summer might be over, but these two are just getting started.”
The extensive rollout of ‘Brat’ has seen a notable surge in popularity for the pop star – see how 2024’s ‘Brat’ summer came to be here.
Earlier this week, Charli performed a “surprise” mini-show in the middle of New York’s Times Square, with a setlist consisting of ‘365’, ‘360’, ‘Von Dutch’, ‘Apple’ and ‘Guess’, along with the remixes of ‘365’ and ‘Guess’.

The Times Square gig came just two days after she pulled double duty on SNL, hosting and performing. During the skit show, she debuted an impression of Adele that’s been hailed as “so accurate” by fans.
The SNL stint follows the release of her remix album ‘Brat And It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat’. In a five-star review of the LP, NME shared that the album “is a home run for its creator, letting her finish the game on her own terms. She has perfected the art of remixing, keeping the songs moving by giving them a brand new lease of life rather than letting them exist statically in their original form.”
Next week, Charli will embark on an arena tour in the UK with special guest Shygirl. Kicking off at Manchester’s Co-op Live on November 27, Charli will move on to London’s The O2 on November 28 and Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena on November 29, before wrapping in Glasgow’s OVO Hydro Arena on December 2. Visit here for tickets.
She’ll also play two outdoor shows in 2025 for fans in Belfast and Dublin, performing at Belfast’s Belsonic 2025 at Ormeau Park on June 18, and Dublin’s Malahide Castle the day before.
Outside of her touring schedule – which will see her headline Primavera Sound and play Coachella next year – she now has six screen projects on the way, including Gregg Araki’s I Want Your Sex and graphic novel adaptation 100 Nights Of Hero, and was recently cast in a film loosely inspired by Joan of Arc.
