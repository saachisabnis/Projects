Hardcore-led fest Outbreak is coming to Victoria Park for one day only next summer
Hot from the announcements of headliners Jamie xx and Charli XCX, new Victoria Park day festival LIDO has today (November 27) revealed details of its third festival next summer. And this time itâ€™s being put together by none other than legendary northern hardcore fest Outbreak. Â Â 
Outbreak, for those Londoners not in-the-know, is a hardcore festival that first took place in Sheffield in 2011. In the years since it has been held in Leeds and Manchester and expanded to include all sorts of alternative artists, from hip-hop to indie rock.
Next year will mark the first time that Outbreak has been held in London. Its LIDO day will be on Friday June 13, the day before its Manchester edition returns on June 14-15. Organisers reckon the Victoria Park event will be the biggest hardcore-led outdoor event ever held in the UK.Â 
Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about Outbreak 2025 in London, from the lineup so far to when tickets go on sale.Â 
Mark your calendars, hardcore fans. Outbreak will take place at Victoria Park on Friday June 13 2025.Â 
Headlining are hardcore crossover titans Turnstile, in what will be a UK exclusive show for 2025. Theyâ€™re also playing Primavera Sound in Barcelona and Porto around the same time.Â 
Also high on the bill are Alex G, Knocked Loose and Sunny Day Real Estate, though the rest of the lineup also features fab artists like Danny Brown, Have a Nice Life, SPEED and Model/Actriz.Â 
Hereâ€™s the poster so far, with more acts still to be announced.
Tickets will go on sale on the Outbreak website here on Friday November 29.
You can get access to a presale on Thursday November 28 at 10am by signing up here.
