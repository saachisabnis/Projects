adidas has unveiled its full-year financial results for 2023, which many on the business side of fashion have been paying close attention to given the brand’s severed relationship with Ye. The company’s net sales hit €21.4 billion EUR, which is down 4.8% for 2022. But it’s important to note that although the numbers were better than expected, the figure was flat on a currency-neutral basis.
“Despite losing a lot of YEEZY revenue and a very conservative sell-in strategy, we managed to have flat revenues,” said adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden. “We expected to have a substantial negative operating result but achieved an operating profit of €268 million EUR. With a very disciplined go-to-market and buying process, we reduced our inventories by almost €1.5 billion EUR. With the exception of the US, we now have healthy inventories everywhere.”
Additionally, adidas’ operating profit neared €1 billion EUR higher than expected due to the sale of its remaining YEEZY products. For more detailed information about adidas’ 2023 financial performance head to the link above and the full report here.
Y/Project FW24 Trades a Runway Show for a Fame-Filled Lookbook

















Y/Project




Each Paris Fashion Week, one of the most anticipated names on the roster is Y/Project due to Glenn Martens’ ability to subvert not just denim but the essence of contemporary warped styles. It’s fresh and something Martens has made a design signature of. But as last month’s PFW neared, the brand announced that it was canceling its runway show. Instead, the brand has revealed a fame-filled lookbook for the Fall/Winter 2024 season.
About the show’s cancellation, Martens told Vogue that the decision was a financial one – opting to alot the €450,000 EUR towards production pre-payment of the collection instead of a runway show. So to bring in the collection that celebrates Martens’ 10th anniversary at the label, the lookbook enlisted the help of brand friends featuring artists Ye, Charli XCX and Tyga; editors Camille B Waddington, Haley Wollens, Olivier Zham and Mel Ottenberg and models Irina Shayk, Kim Peers and Natasha Poly.
Inside the lookbook, you’ll see Martens’ vision of reimagined formalwear, warped denim, elegant yet modern draping and even the debut of a Salomon Speedcross 3 collaboration.

Y/Project

Each Paris Fashion Week, one of the most anticipated names on the roster is Y/Project due to Glenn Martens’ ability to subvert not just denim but the essence of contemporary warped styles. It’s fresh and something Martens has made a design signature of. But as last month’s PFW neared, the brand announced that it was canceling its runway show. Instead, the brand has revealed a fame-filled lookbook for the Fall/Winter 2024 season.
About the show’s cancellation, Martens told Vogue that the decision was a financial one – opting to alot the €450,000 EUR towards production pre-payment of the collection instead of a runway show. So to bring in the collection that celebrates Martens’ 10th anniversary at the label, the lookbook enlisted the help of brand friends featuring artists Ye, Charli XCX and Tyga; editors Camille B Waddington, Haley Wollens, Olivier Zham and Mel Ottenberg and models Irina Shayk, Kim Peers and Natasha Poly.
Inside the lookbook, you’ll see Martens’ vision of reimagined formalwear, warped denim, elegant yet modern draping and even the debut of a Salomon Speedcross 3 collaboration.

Walter Chiapponi announced his exit as creative director of Blumarine on Thursday, after showing just one collection for the brand.
Marco Marchi, the administrator of the brand’s parent company Eccellenze Italiane Holding, said, ““This experience will remain unique at a special moment in Blumarine’s history. I am grateful to Walter Chiapponi for pouring so much of himself into this collection. It has been an extraordinary adventure. I wish Walter all the best for the continuation of his journey.”
On his exit, Chiapponi stated, “For me, it was a sort of return to the future in which I focused all my love and creative passion. My thanks for this experience go first and foremost to Marco Marchi, who made it possible, but also to all those without whom I wouldn’t have been able to express myself as I did. I am especially referring to people I have loved and who are no longer with us, but who continue to instill strong emotions in me, to inspire my feelings and my journey. I now want to concentrate on new initiatives and projects with a social and humanitarian scope before returning at a later date, at the right time, to the catwalk.”

Kim Kardashian has been making waves with SKIMS. The brand has tossed up a range of campaigns with the likes of SZA, Cardi B, Lana Del Rey, Kim Cattrall, Coco Jones, Usher and many more. Aside from campaigns, the brand has become an official underwear partner of the NBA. In continuing its blazing growth and popularity, the brand has now unveiled its debut TV commercial.
Directed by Fran Lebon, the “SKIMS Lab” campaign heads to outer space where it sees Kim Kardashian in a laboratory alongside her working clones. “With this being our first-ever made-for-TV campaign, we really wanted to bring viewers into the SKIMS universe and create a film about our brand story and obsession with product development in a witty, yet extravagant way,” Kardashian said in a statement.
