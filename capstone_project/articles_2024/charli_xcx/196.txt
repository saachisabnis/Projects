"Is this real"
Chappell Roan has reacted to fans pointing out similarities between her merchandise and that of the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign.
This week, the Democratic candidate and her new running mate unveiled a cap in hunting camouflage colours, with the names ‘Harris’ and ‘Walz’ emblazoned in orange all caps.
Fans of Roan were quick to point out the apparent similarity to a merch item that was made available alongside her debut album ‘The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess’ last year. See the two side-by-side below.

Several stars of music have expressed their support for Harris’ campaign since Joe Biden stepped down from the presidential race last month, including Bon Iver and Megan Thee Stallion, who have both performed at her rallies, as well as Beyoncé, Charli XCX and Olivia Rodrigo.
For Roan meanwhile, it is an extremely busy period, with the singer recently announcing a series of limited-edition vinyl pressings to celebrate the first anniversary of debut album ‘The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess’.
The album is on course to hit Number One in the UK, while her Lollapalooza set last weekend is among the best-attended in the festival’s history.
In a four-star review of “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess’, NME called it, ”A display of Roan’s bold and brazen pen, where she places searing revelations alongside some deliciously cheeky choruses.
Back in March, Roan announced a run of UK and European shows to come later this year, beginning in Berlin, Germany, on 31 August. She’ll then be playing Paris, France and Amsterdam, Netherlands, before hitting the UK and Ireland. She’s set to finish at O2 Brixton Academy in London on 24 September, before a series of American dates to round off the year.
