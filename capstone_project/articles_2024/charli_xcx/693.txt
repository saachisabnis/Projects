 We don't know when the official opening of Jelly Roll's new bar in Nashville will be, but sources say it'll be "coming soon."
It's called Goodnight Nashville, and it's going to be five-stories tall on Broadway . . . Which means it's going to be a madhouse.
They just released the logo which says, "Goodnight Nashville . . . Burgers, Spirits, Tattoos."
It IS Jelly Roll's bar after all. So, it shouldn't be surprising that you can get some FRESH INK after you've had a beer or two.

A new Coheed & Cambria album is on the way, but it’ll be a few months. “The Father of Make Believe” is scheduled to release on March 14th through Virgin Music Group. It’ll be the tenth studio album from the band, and it’ll keep the narrative of “The Amory Wars”/”Vaxis” universe going. Their last album, “Vaxis Act II: A Window of the Waking Mind” brought the band its first-ever Top 10 radio single in “Shoulders,” and the expectation is that the new record will keep their rise going.

Garth Brooks was supposed to appear on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" for an "Outdoor Mini-Concert" next Monday. It was being hyped as recently as a few days ago, but it's now been scrapped, and it won't be rescheduled.
There's no specific reason why. Fans who had tickets just got a message that said, "Television production decisions can fluctuate due to a variety of reasons . . . unfortunately . . . these things sometimes happen."
There's no indication that the cancelation has anything to do with Garth's legal issues, but it's possible. He hasn't made a public appearance since mid-October, about a week after the sexual assault suit was filed.
