Miley Cyrus is standing up for pop music's rising stars.
In a new interview with Harpers Bazaar published Wednesday (November 20), Cyrus defended Chappell Roan for the way she has been navigating her skyrocketing fame by attempting to set boundaries with fans, especially in regards to how prevalent social media is today, per People. 
"I wish people would not give her a hard time," she said, adding, "It's probably really hard coming into this business with phones and Instagram. That wasn't always a part of my life, and I'm not a part of it now."
The "Flowers" hitmaker also revealed that she was one of the famous names who had reached out to the "Good Luck, Babe!" singer to show support for her previous comments about the complicated feelings that come with newfound success. Roan has even stated that she "might quit" music if her fame reaches "dangerous" levels.
In September, the 26-year-old musician praised Charli XCX for being the first artist to reach out and check on her amid her growing fame, telling her how it was "about to get really hard" and offering to be there for her should she need a friend. Lorde also connected with Roan to share some advice about how to cope with "abusive" fame.
