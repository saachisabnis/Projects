Leave it to Julia Fox to continue to find new ways to wear a bikini.
On Jan. 19, the Down the Drain author and mom, 33, was seen in Park City, Utah in a look that can only be described as "sexy snow bunny."
The Uncut Gems star, whose new film, Presence, will premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, conquered the chilly Utah temperatures in an unexpected outfit — a white cable-knit bikini layered over a black catsuit.
Her white faux fur coat and Sorel's $200 Caribou snow boots tied everything together while her KNWLS handbag and Gentle Monster sunglasses added cool touches to the bold look.

Her latest look proves once again that Fox never shies away from fashion risks.
Earlier in the month, at a Sotheby's exhibit in New York City, she wore a wedding-style white dress, with a gigantic cutout in the middle that revealed her abs and the upper half of her thighs. In between the fabric? A black thong.
She topped off the look with a bridal veil with ruffle trim.

It you ever wondered where Fox's affinity for cut-up, deconstructed clothes comes from (remember her DIY denim micro bandeau from that time in 2022), she explained all of it to Charli XCX for Interview magazine.

"I never had money for clothes so I would go to all these really nice stores on Fifth Avenue and steal gorgeous clothes. Then I would make them my own by cutting them up," Fox said in the December interview with the singer, adding that she used to unknowingly snub bigger designers when she was just becoming famous to wear clothes she found more unique.
