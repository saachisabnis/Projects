	Her mom and Support+Feed founder Maggie Baird added of the Hit Me Hard and Soft official sponsor, “Amex has been vital to our intersectional mission of providing healthy meals to communities experiencing food insecurity, and the fact that together we’re also able to support small businesses when they need it is incredibly meaningful.”

	Eilish has two more sold-out nights of her tour at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on Friday (Dec. 20) and Saturday (Dec. 21) before she heads down to Australia in February and early March, followed by spring/summer 2025 tour dates across Europe.
