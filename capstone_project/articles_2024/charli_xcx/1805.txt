On Oct. 30, 2024, rapper Quavo, known for his role in the iconic hip-hop group Migos, was honored with the Humanitarian Award at the Variety Hitmakers celebration. This recognition comes as a testament to his unwavering commitment to reducing gun violence, a cause that has become deeply personal following the tragic loss of his nephew and fellow Migos member, Takeoff.
Since the fatal shooting of Takeoff on Nov. 1, 2022, Quavo has transformed his grief into action. Takeoff was shot at a bowling alley in Houston during a private event, an incident that shocked fans and the music industry alike. The autopsy revealed that Takeoff died from multiple gunshot wounds, and his death was ruled a homicide. This devastating event propelled Quavo to take a stand against gun violence, leading to the establishment of the Rocket Foundation.
Through the Rocket Foundation, Quavo aims to make Atlanta a national model for gun violence reduction. The foundation focuses on promoting programming and grants that uplift communities and support violence prevention initiatives. Quavo’s efforts are not just limited to his hometown; he has partnered with influential figures, including Vice President Kamala Harris, to advocate for criminal violence intervention. This collaboration highlights the importance of community engagement and policy reform in addressing the gun violence epidemic.
In April 2023, Quavo hosted the Huncho Day celebrity football game, which successfully raised $2 million for the Rocket Foundation. This event not only showcased Quavo’s commitment to the cause but also brought together various celebrities and community members to rally for a common goal — ending gun violence. Such initiatives are crucial in fostering a sense of community and encouraging others to contribute to the fight against violence.
Quavo’s advocacy work has not gone unnoticed. At the Variety Hitmakers event, executive music editor Jem Aswad emphasized the significance of recognizing artists who leverage their platforms for positive change. He stated, “Music can make the world a better place on its own, but with these honors, we want to recognize the efforts of three musicians who also have used their platforms to improve the lives of others.” Quavo’s dedication to this cause exemplifies how artists can influence social issues and inspire their fans to take action.
Quavo, along with other honorees such as Charli XCX, will be celebrated at a brunch on Dec. 7 in Los Angeles, sponsored by AFEELA by Sony Honda Mobility Inc. This event will further highlight the contributions of artists who are making a difference in their communities.
Quavo’s journey from a grieving uncle to a passionate advocate for gun violence reduction is a powerful narrative that resonates with many. His efforts through the Rocket Foundation and collaborations with prominent figures demonstrate a commitment to creating a safer environment for future generations. As he continues to use his platform for good, Quavo serves as an inspiration for others in the music industry and beyond to engage in meaningful advocacy.
