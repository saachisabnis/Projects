Kylie Minogue has nabbed five nominations at the 2024 Aria Awards while Royel Otis has been recognised an impressive eight times.
The Aussie pop legend, 56, has received nods across five different categories, including for two of the top gongs - album of the year and best solo artist.
Her smash hit album Tension has also been nominated best pop release while the titular single is also in the running for song of the year.
In the best solo artist category, Kylie is up against huge Aussie stars including The Kid LAROI, Tones and I, Troye Sivan and Dom Dolla, among others.
She will also be battling it out against Amy Shark, Angie McMahon, Royel Otis and Troye in the album of the year category.
The huge achievement comes after Kylie confirmed she will be embarking on a 10-date Australian tour and releasing a new album, titled Tension II. 
Elsewhere, Indie pop duo Royel Otis, made up of singer Otis Pavlovic and guitarist Royel Maddell, have incredibly led the pack with a landslide eight nominations.
The group, known for their cover of Sophie Ellis-Bextor's hit Murder on the Dancefloor, are up for album of the year, best group and best rock album.

They are also in the running for song of the year, best Australian live act, best engineered release, best produced release and best independent release.
They are followed closely behind by Dom Dolla, who has secured six nominations including for best solo artist, best electronic release and song of the year.
Meanwhile, Troye, Tones and I, First Nations hip hop collective 3%, Amy Shark, Rüfüs Du Sol and The Kid LAROI have all landed four nominations.
Confidence Man and FISHER have also been recognised in three categories, with the winners set to be crowned at the Hordern Pavilion on November 20.
The 2024 Aria Awards in partnership with YouTube showcase the best of Australia's music talents and will air live from 5pm AEDT on Stan.
ARIA CEO Annabelle Herd said: 'Everyone at ARIA is absolutely thrilled to celebrate such an incredible list of commercially successful nominees for 2024, across a huge breadth of genres. 
'It is a list that covers global megastars, touring acts on the brink of world domination and a genuinely exciting group of up-and-coming stars with plenty of buzz.'
Kylie's award success is her latest achievement in an incredible year since the release of her smash hit album Tension.

Tension's lead single Padam Padam received critical acclaim from music critics and it won the inaugural Best Pop Dance Recording award at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in February.
After Tension outsold the entire top 20 combined on the UK charts gave Kylie her second Grammy, the songstress is now releasing a follow-up album titled Tension II. 
Tension II will hope to replicate the success of Tension and her fans have gone wild after learning of her new music plans.
She will also be jetting off on a world tour at the start of 2025, and is treating Aussies to an epic 10 shows Down Under.
It marks Kylie's first tour Down Under since 2019 and comes after her headlining stint at Splendour In The Grass festival had to be cancelled earlier this year.
As well as her Australia dates, Kylie will also be performing around Asia and the United Kingdom.
'I can't wait to share beautiful and wild moments with fans all over the world, celebrating the Tension era and more,' she gushed in an announcement this week.
'It's been an exhilarating ride so far and now, get ready for your close up because I will be calling Lights, Camera, Action… and there will be a whole lot of Padaming!'
