The Brat Tour is coming to London this week â€“ hereâ€™s everything to know about the gig
2024 has been Charli XCXâ€™s year. Brat (the album) has been an all-conquering force, getting hundreds of millions of listeners, defining a season (Brat Summer) and being named one of Time Outâ€™s records of the year. Charli herself has been touring the planet in support of the album, and Brat (the word) was even named Collinsâ€™ â€˜word of the yearâ€™.Â 
And this week London finally gets its dose of Brat mania. Charli XCX is playing the O2 Arena â€“ Londonâ€™s biggest indoor venue â€“ and itâ€™s going to be huge. This week Charli announced another gig in the capital for next summer at east Londonâ€™s Victoria Park.Â 
Heading to see Charli XCX and Brat at the O2 this week? Hereâ€™s everything you need to know, from timings to any remaining ticket availability.Â
