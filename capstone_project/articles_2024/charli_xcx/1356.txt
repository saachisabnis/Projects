Charli XCX is set to star in Cathy Yan's upcoming film "The Gallerist" alongside Jenna Ortega and Natalie Portman. The movie boasts a star-studded cast that includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Zach Galifianakis, and more. The film follows a gallerist attempting to sell a dead body at Art Basel in Miami and is set to start shooting at the end of the year. Charli is also working on other acting projects, including the Pete Ohs-directed movie "Erupcja" and the thriller "I Want Your Sex" with Olivia Wilde.
