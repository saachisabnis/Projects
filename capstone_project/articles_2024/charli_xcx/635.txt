Sacrifice, the forthcoming Romain Gavras-directed thriller loosely inspired by the Joan Of Arc Story and led by Chris Evans, Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek Pinault and Sam Richardson, just welcomed an onslaught of talent to its power-packed cast.
According to Deadline, the film will now also star Yung Lean, Charli XCX, Jeremy O. Harris, Vincent Cassel, John Malkovich, Ambika Mod, Jade Croot and Miriam Silverman.
The movie is based on a screenplay that Gavras co-wrote with Succession‘s Will Arbery. The story follows Joan (Taylor-Joy), who embarks on a mission to save the world from an evil volcanic spirit alongside her mystical squad. The radical group raids a star-studded charity gala and takes three hostages: fallen movie star Mike Tyler (Evans), the world’s richest man Bracken (Cassel) and an unlucky girl named Katie (Mod). The trio is then tied to Joan’s quest to defend humanity, one that requires sacrifice — hence the title.
Sacrifice is currently filming in Greece and Berlin. Gavras is producing the film alongside Iconoclast, Robert Walak, Jacob Perlin, Taylor-Joy and Evans, with Arbery on board as executive producer.
Notably, Yung Lean will make his film debut in this project. Charli XCX, meanwhile, has added several film and television roles to her plate in the months following brat‘s superstar success, with upcoming features in projects titled 100 Nights of Hero, Overcompensating and Faces of Death.
