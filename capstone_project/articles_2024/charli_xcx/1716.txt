TeeRoy's 2 Cents?:
It’s that time of the year again — when former President Barack Obama shares a playlist of the tracks he’s been listening to over the past few months.
On Monday, he tweeted out, “With summer winding down, I wanted to share some songs that I’ve been listening to lately and it wouldn’t be my playlist if it didn’t include an eclectic mix. I hope you find something new to listen to!” 
The presidential playlist includes cuts from Beyonce, Shaboozey, Charli XCX, Tommy Richman, H.E.R., Jill Scott, Saweetie, Moneybagg Yo, GloRilla featuring Megan Thee Stallion, Tyla, Gunna, and Skillibeng. But Barry isn’t just bumping the latest hits — there are plenty of throwback tracks in the mix, too. Those presidential picks include Blackstreet featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen “No Diggity” and 2Pac featuring K-Ci & JoJo’s “How Do U Want It,” Common’s “The People,” and Digable Planet’s “Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat).”
