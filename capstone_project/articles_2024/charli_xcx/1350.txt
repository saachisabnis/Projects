Megan Thee Stallion is giving her full support to Kamala Harris in her campaign for president, with the rapper slated to perform at the Vice President’s upcoming rally tomorrow in Atlanta.

	Megan confirmed on her Instagram that she’s heading down south to support Harris with a special performance at 7:30 p.m. ET. “ATL HOTTIES SEE YOU TOMORROW 🇺🇸💙,” she wrote in a caption accompanying the news.

	This wouldn’t be Megan’s first brush with Harris. In March 2023, Harris partnered with Glamour to cohost a Women’s History Month brunch at her residence in Washington, DC. Megan shared a gallery of photos on her social media profiles depicting her arm-in-arm with Harris.

	She joins a legion of musicians who have recently come out in support of Harris’ bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the upcoming election. Beyoncé, who joined Harris on her “Savage” remix, permitted Harris to use the song “Freedom” in her walk-out music as well as in the first advertisement for the campaign. Her “WAP” costar Cardi B also supported Harris, defending her against “disgusting” sexist attacks.

	Harris, who stepped up as the potential presidential nominee after Joe Biden withdrew his reelection campaign last Sunday, stirred up immediate online support after Charli XCX declared that “Kamala IS brat” on X (formerly Twitter), referring to the hip culture surrounding her sixth album “Brat.” Harris’ campaign was quick to jump on the endorsement, changing the header for their X profile to resemble the slime green color featured on the cover of “Brat.”

	Harris appears to be leaning into Gen Z and millennial culture, as she most recently joined TikTok and made a cameo in a Lance Bass post referencing *NSYNC’s “Bye, Bye, Bye.”
