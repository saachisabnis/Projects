What’s the apple of the Apple Music app’s eye? Apple Music finalized the top ten of its top 100 albums of all-time list on May 22, ultimately declaring Lauryn Hill’s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill the very best. “I appreciate the acknowledgement, I really do, but I’d be remiss not to also acknowledge all of the music and artists who informed and inspired me,” Hill said in a statement. “The leaders of community and movements that sparked me, the social dynamics and music scenes, both older and current at the time, that intrigued and inspired me to contribute.”
We surprised @MsLaurynHill at an intimate dinner in New York to tell her that The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was No. 1 on our #100BestAlbums list. 🏆 What does this album mean to you? pic.twitter.com/BslciRVEm0
Alongside Hill in the top ten were the usual suspects: Michael Jackson’s Thriller at two, the Beatles’ Abbey Road at three, Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life at six. New entries into the canon included Beyoncé’s 2016 album Lemonade at ten, Frank Ocean’s 2016 album Blonde at five (good year!), and Taylor Swift’s 2023 album (that’s a re-recording of a 2014 album) 1989 (Taylor’s Version) at 18. Some of the anger is, no surprise, Swift related. Also, the lack of Mariah Carey. P4ks have been sharpened, but getting mad at Apple itself is futile — Tim Cook’s favorite artist is quite literally One Republic.
The list is actually made from the opinions of music-industry insiders, including artists, songwriters, and producers, according to Apple, alongside a “team of experts.” Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives are just some of the artists polled. Oh, so that’s why Charli’s four-song Vroom Vroom EP wasn’t No. 1: a conflict of interest!
