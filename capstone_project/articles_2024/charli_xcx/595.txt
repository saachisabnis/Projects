‘Don’t dox her – we worked it out on the remix!’
The creator of the TikTok Apple dance Kelley Heyer has addressed her viral appearance at Charli XCX and Troye Sivan’s SWEAT tour after her big screen camera moment got stage invaded by another fan trying to steal the limelight. The moment was all over TikTok and Twitter / X yesterday as conversations increase regarding concert etiquette, with many calling out the behaviour of this person as Kelley Heyer was having her moment. After many incensed responses, Kelley Heyer addresses the Sweat tour moment as the Apple dance creator and puts it all to bed.
For context, Kelley Hewer is the TikTok creator credited with making the viral dance that goes with Apple by Charli XCX, taken from Brat. The dance and how viral it got has made the track a runway hit single from the album. During the Sweat tour, Charli XCX features someone in the crowd as ‘the Apple Girl’ – who has a moment on the big screen doing the TikTok routine. On Monday night, the Apple Girl was Kelley Hewer – but her moment was upstaged by a widely criticised fan jumping in to join in and get in the limelight.

As backlash towards the person who invaded Kelley Hewer’s moment, the Apple dance creator made a video on TikTok to address the drama following the stage invasion at the Charli XCX SWEAT tour. And it’s actually had a really happy ending!

Speaking in a very chill hair-in-towel video, Kelley explained “Okay guys, I just wanna nip this in the bud before it gets out of hand – the girl who jumps in to do Apple with me, I didn’t know who she was. We found each other on socials, she apologised so much I told her it was totally fine, I understand. The lights, the loud music and everything – she just got really excited. We worked it out on the remix. Do not f*cking dox her.
“It was such an amazing moment for me and Charli said those amazing nice words. I don’t want that girl’s experience of the SWEAT tour to be stained or soured because of comments you guys are leaving. I really appreciate how much you guys want to defend and support me, I truly do. All of you can have your own opinions – I’m just asking you guys to have a little bit of grace, and please don’t dox her. Let’s soften the comments a little bit.
“Also, I take a little bit of responsibility for posting the video because I didn’t even realise what had happened. My partner took that video of me and afterwards I was really excited, so I just uploaded it and didn’t realise you guys would focus so much on that. It’s kinda my fault for inadvertently putting her in the social media spotlight.”
