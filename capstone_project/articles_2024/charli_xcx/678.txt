See “brat” live when Charli XCX and Troye Sivan bring their “Sweat” tour to Detroit, Michigan in only two weeks. Initially known for upbeat pop songs like “Boom Clap,” the Essex star eventually pivoted towards more club-inspired hyperpop music, especially with her recent album. The record includes tracks like “Apple,” “360,” “365,” and “Girl, so confusing,” all of which have exploded on TikTok. And, following the meteoric album release, Charli XCX came out with collaborations featuring fellow alternative pop stars Lorde and Billie Eilish.
Charli XCX and Troye Sivan are also no strangers to collaboration, working together in 2018 to release their track, “1999.” With more of an indie/synth sound, Troye Sivan has released alt-pop songs like “YOUTH” and “Strawberries & Cigarettes.”
