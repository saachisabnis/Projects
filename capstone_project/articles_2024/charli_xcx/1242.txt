“I feel like we get caught into such a nostalgic thing that we’re forgetting to make new things”
Members of Fontaines D.C. have said that they “couldn’t really give a shit” about the Oasis reunion, and Liam Gallagher has responded.
The Britpop icons recently announced news of their long-awaited reformation, and took the world by storm by announcing 2025 live shows.
Already, the ‘Oasis Live 25’ world tour has sold out all of its initially shared 14 stadium dates – set to take place between Cardiff, Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin next summer. Two extra shows in London have also been announced for September 2025, and tickets will be available to fans who were unsuccessful the first time around.
However, some members of Irish indie band Fontaines D.C. have made it clear that they’re not excited about the reunion, but are instead bored at the idea of nostalgic music making a comeback.
Carlos O’Connell and Conor Deegan III shared their stance during a new interview with Studio Brussel, and said that the news of the reunion goes against what they were hoping to achieve with their own music.
“I couldn’t really give a shit, to be honest,” O’Connell responded when the interviewer asked him if he was excited about Liam and Noel Gallagher getting back together.
Deegan added: “I’m not excited about it either, to be honest. I feel like we get caught in the last era – like the ’10s – and into such a nostalgic thing that we’re forgetting to make new things.

“I feel like what we were wanting to do with this record [‘Romance’] anyway was to look into the future and make new things… So for Oasis to reform at this moment for us is really annoying.”
Already, Liam Gallagher has responded to the comments made by Deegan and O’Connell. Taking to X/Twitter to respond to a fan who asked if the band would be considered as an opening act for the Oasis tour, he said: “Fuck them little spunkbubbles I’ve seen better dressed ROADIES.”
“They look like a shit EMF,” he added in a separate tweet, as well as responding to another fan who forwarded a clip from the interview over. “State of em,” he wrote.

While Deegan and O’Connell aren’t too enthusiastic about the Britpop icons getting back together, the band’s frontman Grian Chatten has made it clear that he doesn’t share the same stance.
Posting a comment on one of NME‘s recent Instagram posts, the vocalist wrote: “I love Oasis. This is not my opinion”.

Fontaines D.C.’s latest album, ‘Romance’, was released last month (August 23) and marked their first LP under their new label home XL Recordings. In a glowing five-star review of the James Ford-produced record, NME shared: “‘Romance’ offers moments of wonder and gravity while also feeling occasionally foreboding.”
With the direction of the album, the band were clear that they wanted to implement a distinct move away from the rockier sound on their debut album, ‘Dogrel’.
Speaking to NME about the new record and explaining what the members were hoping to achieve, Chatten recalled how they actively wanted to surprise fans with their new direction.
“To be creatively understood by too many people feels like flies settling all over your clothes and all over your face. Every now and again you have to fucking shake them off, just to see who you are again. That’s what we wanted to do,” he said.
“We spoke a lot about visual references, films and stuff like that. I’m not even messing, but we used to speak about: ‘What kind of weather is it in this song?’ We could meet on a plain that didn’t have anything to do with music, arrangements or instruments. It’s more about abstractly getting to the right place. I think it’s more interesting to work in that way because you’re at less danger of sounding contrived or unoriginal.”
He went on to expand on the band’s new sound, and on comparisons to ‘KoRn’ and ‘cyberpunk’, which fits in with the band’s changing, more broodier aesthetic.
Chatten added: “Some of the music is exaggerated in that sense. The colours that I hear in the music are not colours that you’d find in nature. The songs sound neon and ridiculous. In order to communicate that idea thoroughly, I didn’t want to go out on stage dressed the same as I was for ‘Dogrel’ or whatever. I wanted to put the audience in the right mindset to render them sensitive to the message we were trying to convey.”
Later this year, Chatten and co. will embark on their 2024 UK and Ireland headline tour, which is set to take place in November and December. That stint includes two nights at Alexandra Palace in the capital.
The group also recently unveiled news of a huge outdoor show at London’s Finsbury Park, due to take place on Saturday July 5, 2025. It will mark the Irish band’s biggest headline performance to date, with support coming from Amyl And The Sniffers and Kneecap. Find remaining tickets to their shows here.
