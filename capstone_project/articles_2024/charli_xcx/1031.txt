Brat Girl Summer. Demure Fall. Fashion changes, but style endures.
Whether you’re a baby boomer just now learning of the newer generation or a millennial in a constant battle with their younger peers, one thing is for sure — Gen Z has left an incredible mark on the fabric of society. 
This is most evident on TikTok, where Gen Z users (typically born around the late 1990s — if not the early 2000s through the early 2010s) are taking a stand when it comes to style. Most notably, the “Zoomers” as some like to call them, have canceled skinny jeans, to the dismay and flat out disdain of Millennials and those who had to suffer through wide-leg gauchos and low-rise flares in their own youth. 
Other cancellations include having a side part in your hair, wearing crew-length socks, the laughing-crying emoji, and rose gold, to name a few. However, some fashion blasts from the past are back in style again according to Gen Z. This list includes loafers and platform shoes from the early ’90s, biker shorts from the 80s, crew necks from the 60s, and even kitten heels of the 50s.

Since Gen Z is now the largest generation alive as of 2020, maybe it’s wise to listen to the youngsters as opposed to the elders, as they have also been deemed to be more financially stable, frugal, health-conscious and body-positive than any previous generation. 
So, whether you think ‘hobo-bags’ are out-of-touch or you’re obsessed with slip dresses and skinny sunglasses, Generation Z and their loud and unapologetic fashion choices are here to stay. Take a look at some of Gen Z’s favorite looks from brands like Revolve, Meshki, Free People, Reformation, Urban Outfitters and more. 
Regardless of your opinion on Gen Z’s proliferating list of microtrends and aesthetics (sometimes it seems like there is a new one every week), most can agree that they’re making waves in the world of fashion and there is no way to ignore them. 
Below, The Post has rounded up some of the most popular Gen Z fashion trends of the year.
Old money, quiet luxury, finance bro fall.. call it what you want but this trend speaks for itself. It’s not to be overdone. Instead of flexing your wealth with name brands, and lavish jewelry, Gen Z has chosen to show off the ‘quiet luxury’ style a bit more subtly. It’s a style they might call, “very demure, very cutesy.”
This trend encompasses a range of classy looks that can be applied to a variety of settings — whether it’s walking around the city or a weekend away at the beach. Fabrics matter. Think silk, sateen, linen, and cashmere. Softer solids are suggested, but small pops of colors, stripes, and minimalistic accessories can be applied if done correctly.

While the purpose of Quiet Luxury is still to look expensive, this is a trend that can still be achieved on a budget. Abercrombie & Fitch offers some reasonably priced cashmere tops and linen pants. J.Crew frequently spins out new accessories that have that ‘old money’ edge — little gold earrings, sun hats, bows, and sleek sunglasses.
Dare we call these the purrr-fect shoes? Kitten heels aren’t exactly a new trend, but Gen Z has given them a major revival — particularly for the Gen Z woman just entering the corporate world. While neutral shades are great for an easy, ready-for-work style, these are also the type of heel that Gen Zers can grab in just about any color or print. Bright pink, denim, cheetah print — you name it.

So, what exactly makes a kitten heel a kitten heel? These dainty point-toe heels are not quite as far off the ground as some other pumps, making it much easier to walk around in them, especially if you’re on your feet all day at work or heading to the bar at night. But, they still have all the same class as your regular heels, plus a little more sass. 
Anthropologie has some lovely decorative options from Bibi Lou and Revolve has looks from Tony Bianco . Lola Cruz. Princess Polly is one of the best stores to score a pair of strappier kitten heels for under $50 — just consider sizing up a half-size if you plan to put on putting a good amount of miles on these shoes. 
There have been some mixed feelings about the “Office Siren” movement — a push by this year’s summer interns to explore more risqué styles at work. But, if there is one piece of clothing that has survived Gen Z’s evolving feelings about workwear it is the blazer.

But, not any blazer. The twenty-somethings have a particular admiration for oversized blazers. Something that might hit below the hips and leave a bit of room at the shoulders. These jackets are often thrown over a more casual outfit to add some sophistication. But, the goal is to look effortless. 
Artizia is housed with an ample variety of options. The Wildred New Generation Blazer features a tailored, single-breasted classic-fit twill with a soft, wool-like feel. Reformation has its Classic Relaxed Blazer, which comes in seven shades for endless styling opportunities, and Open Edit offers a variety of cuts, some of which are under $50. 
Having a bad hair day? Thankfully, baseball caps are back in (specifically, this one from Alo). So are biker shorts, oversized sweats, and giant straw clips. Pretty much anything you can wear on a #hotgirlwalk or throw on for a low-profile look after a long night out. It’s called “athleisure” — comfortable, casual athletic wear.
Comfort is key! #athleisure #fashiongirlies 
At half the length and half the price of regular leggings, we aren’t complaining that Gen Z is bringing back biker shorts. While many Gen Zers will just throw a sweatshirt over these shorts for a casual day on the couch, this collection is also perfect for low-impact workouts, such as yoga or cycling. Plus, many lululemon styles boast a hidden waistband pocket that fits a card or key that won’t get in your way. 
The athleisure aesthetic is no stranger to accessories. Clipped right from the magazines of the ’90s and ’00s, giant claw clips are stylish and super functional, securing even thick hair back off the face or up in a cute messy pony or bun. This six-pack from Amazon is great, especially if you’ve gotten rid of your middle school clips already and need one of every color to kickstart your new collection. 
Move over clogs. Another chunky shoe has clomped back into style with Gen Z. Marked by a squarish toe, smooth leather silhouette, and lace-free construction, the loafer is a popular choice for fresh college graduates entering the workforce. They’re comfortable, easy to wear, and instantly elevate any look.

When it comes to specific styles, most Gen Zers reach for something with a slight heel. Some opt for a one or two-inch platform to add some dimension. Like many of their pickings, the loafer is a unisex shoe, but there are more feminine and masculine options for styling. Pair loafers with a mini skirt or mid-thigh shorts and it’s an instant leg-lengthener. 
An open back like the one found in the Franco Sarto Giada Slingback Loafer Heel is one of the most popular choices. Matte is tolerated, but glossy is preferred. Steve Madden And ASOS also house a variety of loafers for everyday and business casual wear. 
A Coach bag has always been a classic, but now make it a baguette. The trending style was huge in the ’90s and is back again to take the fashion world by storm. This simple over-your-shoulder construction comes in a few different colors (like the maple in the video below), and each is anointed with the signature “C” logo of course. 
yes you need it !!! 🙂‍↕️🤎 #coach #fypシ #coachny #coachretail #shoulderbag 
But, this baguette isn’t the only one Gen Z is taking a bite out of. JW PEI Women’s Gabbi Ruched Hobo Handbag, is still a very popular choice. This croissant-shaped hobo bag was deemed the “IT-girl” bag on JW PEI’s website, everyone from Megan Fox to Hailey Bieber has taken this ruched, vegan leather baguette bag out for a swing. If ivory isn’t your shade, the grass green and bright pink bring a pop of color to any outfit. Or if you’re hungry for something different, you can try it in Nutella.
The great thing about baguette bags is they don’t have to be “designer.” Gen Z has embraced plenty of off-brand options from Amazon and loves a great thrift. But if names like Fendi and Balenciaga are more exciting to you, Saks has an extensive pre-owned section that does not disappoint.

Millennial women may have grown up aspiring to look like the Barbies they played with, but the Gen Z girls grew up with Bratz, and now everybody wants to be one. But, it’s not quite that simple. Gen Z has Charli XCX to thank for this trend. 
The fashion house wheels started turning as soon as the British Pop Icon released the lime green cover of her acclaimed ‘Brat’ album, a string of throwback songs that referenced everything from aimlessly flirting, to overdoing it at the club, and acting a bit like it-girl, Julia Fox. 
Brat Girl Summer is for those who identify as a bit wild, sometimes chaotic, perhaps even a bit messy. But, hot mess, messy. It’s for the ravers who drown their bodies in glitter, sheer mesh tops, low-waisted short skirts, leopard print camis, leather platform boots, and of course, lime green. Anything lime green. 
Nope, not a manufacturing error. Skinny jeans are out. Gen Z isn’t afraid to take some risks with their fashion, and low-waisted, baggy jeans are back in. It’s hard not to be a bit thankful for that added breathing room that these on-trend pants give us. 
It’s literally my size mom  #fyp#fypシ゚#foryou#foryoupage#pourtoi#furdich#protebe#relatable#baggyjeans#jeans#baggyclothes#trendingsound#fashiontiktok#fashion 
Pacsun and Levi’s are probably the most popular brands for back-to-school styles, but throw on a cropped tee and it’s just as easy to transform the low-and-loose look into an outfit with some street-style edge. The wash color doesn’t matter as much, so long as you’d classify them as mom or dad jeans. 
In addition to wider cuts and dropped waistlines, Gen Zers are also picking jeans with some more personality. We think criss-crossed denim is one of the best pairs they’ve chosen. These asymmetrical, upsized jeans from AGOLDE are sure to make heads turn. Sizes range from 23 through 34 – though sizing up is recommended. 
Silver, gold, pearls, charms, and more. When it comes to jewelry trends, mixing metals, and layering are true passions of Gen Z. Pretty much any type of jewelry is up for grabs — especially if it’s gender-fluid. The only thing off limits is rose gold, that shade has been deemed démodé. 
How to layer necklaces to actually look good together!!!
According to Gen Z, how you layer jewelry matters far less than where you get it. Amazon has plenty of bundles in a variety of styles and prices. Starting with a set of two or three gold necklaces that look great together is probably the easiest way to get behind this trend. But, you can also choose your favorites from your jewelry box. 
If there is anything we know about Gen Z, it’s that they love their identity to shine through their style. Bauble Bar offers a thorough customization service, which lets customers add a personal touch to their jewelry by creating a unique charm bracelet or designing a bubble nameplate.

Let’s not get this confused the Brat Girl Aesethic. The Brat Girl trend is built around going out, but the Y2K look is something much easier to integrate into your everyday wardrobe. Think of anything with a futuristic, monochromatic feel. Casual tees and crop tops with metallic texture, glossy cargo pants, and platform sneakers. Velour. Y2K is about celebrating the best of the early 2000s. 
Fashion repeats itself but repeats with improvements 👙👗#fyp#relatable#funny#y2k#fashion#comedy
While Gen Z has pushed back on the overconsumption of fast fashion, there is still a major demand for Shein’s Y2K styles. The brand is here for all the trends, and this one is no exception. You’ll find rhinestone tank tops, plated mini skirts, and plenty of co-ord sets. As an alternative, Forever 21 is also filled with more nostalgic styles — most of which are well under $20, so you’re not losing much if this trend goes away. 
Sunglasses are almost a requirement. Maybe, so you can’t see the haters. 
Teeny tiny glasses are now in style according to Gen Z, and this cat-eye pair is super hot for the summer. They are sold on Amazon and also come in black for the same price, as well as in packs of multiple pairs — should you need new shades for each of your new Gen Z-inspired outfits. 
Gen Z is anything but a homogenous group. Self-expression is at the center of Gen Z style, and that is reflected through the fluid fashion and microtrends that we see them wearing. 
Styles also changes seasonally. While summer might be centered around nostalgic Y2K styles and athleisure wear for #hogirlswalks, fall may lean more toward the finance bro vests, oversized blazers, and trench coats. By the time winter comes around, we could see an entire new trend pop up. 
Sustainability has also become more important to the younger generation, as more Gen Z shoppers prefer to buy from eco-friendly brands. 
Both Gen Z men and women have embraced looser-fitting clothing, from baggy jeans to bomber jackets, and oversized sweats. Even celebrities like Billie Eilish and Kylie Jenner have jumped on the baggy trend.
Some speculate that the tendency for Gen Z to opt for a size too big has to do with the younger generation’s embrace of body positivity and rejection of stereotypical beauty standards. 
However, there is also a greater emphasis on comfort-first clothing in general, and baggy clothes certainly fit the mark.
