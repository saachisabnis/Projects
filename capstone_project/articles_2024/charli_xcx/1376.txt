Erewhon Market, an upscale grocery store in Los Angeles, has become well known for its Smoothie collaborations with celebrities. Similar to the famed Millions of Milkshakes celebrity endorsed drinks of the early 2000s, Erewhon partners with various A-listers on beverages that typically coincide with promoting their work.
From Temecula’s own Olivia Rodrigo’s Good 4 Ur Guts smoothie, reality star Kendall Jenner’s Peaches & Cream smoothie and model Winnie Harlow’s Island Glow smoothie, these collaborations have fans lining up to spend around $20 on the drinks. Hailey Bieber’s Strawberry Glaze Skin smoothie became so popular that it inspired a new ice cream pint flavor with Cosmic Bliss. The grocery store’s latest collaboration isn’t even with a celebrity: the brand Vacation collaborated on a sunscreen drink inspired by its classic lotion.
JUST DROPPED 🔥 Olivia Rodrigo’s Good 4 ur Guts smoothie featuring our Pomegranate Kombucha….now available at @Erewhon Market for a limited time. Good 4 ur gut, good 4 u   #livies #guthealth #healthade #guthappy #erewhonsmoothie

So it wasn’t surprising to many this week when news spread on social media that the latest celebrity endorsed smoothie was with singer Charli XCX to promote her latest album “Brat.” The only thing? The smoothie isn’t real.
Creator Daniel Preda, @misterpreda on TikTok, used his account to share the new smoothie. Preda has a series on his channel where he tests viral food and drinks to determine if they’re “number one hater approved.” Preda has reviewed a few Erewhon treats on his channel in the past, so it didn’t surprise viewers when he started off his video introducing the drink.
“Charli XCX has just collabed with Erewhon to create the exclusive BRAT smoothie,” said Preda. “It’s $31 dollars, let’s see if it’s number one hater approved. This is your world exclusive.”

In the video, which has been viewed over 500,000 times, Preda goes into Erewhon and picks up the smoothie from the counter before trying it in his car. “I got to give them points for creativity, because this is probably their coolest looking smoothie yet.” After listing out the ingredients, he gives the smoothie a try. “The flavor profile is so interesting, you get the bitterness from the lime. Brazilian lemonade is water, limes and condensed milk and it’s so good, one of my favorite drinks ever.”
Preda continues to rave about the drink throughout the video, “Dare I say, this might be my favorite smoothie yet, I’m going to give Erewhon their points for creativity, ingenuity.”
He appears to close out the video by stating that the Brats smoothie in collaboration with Charli XCX is number one hater approved — only it isn’t actually the end of the video.
After cutting to black, Preda continues filming at the 2:48 mark. With just under a minute left in the video, Preda reveals to viewers that the smoothie is an “imaginary collaboration that I created on my own.” Preda says he dreamt up the smoothie to pay some respect to his love of Charli XCX and her sixth studio album. He put together his own drink filled with his favorite brands, ingredients and flavor profiles that he loves.
But despite Preda clarifying that the smoothie does not exist, fans and pop culture social media accounts ran with the news of a new beverage collaboration from the high-end grocery store.
In a now deleted post, PopCrave, a popular Twitter account known for sharing headlines focused on entertainment news, shared an announcement about the beverage. “Charli xcx just dropped her new ‘BRAT’ smoothie @ErewhonMarket. The brazilian matcha lemonade smoothie goes for $31.” The post was viewed over 160,000 times before it was deleted and no correction was posted.
Another creator on TikTok, Alyssa Yung, @_alyssayung_ on TikTok, vlogged her journey to get the new Erewhon smoothie, only to discover that it didn’t exist. When commenters informed her that the original creator had clarified in the end of his video that the smoothie wasn’t real she replied to other users comments sharing she hadn’t watched the whole video.
CHARLI PLS MAKE THE SMOOTHIE REAL #charlixcx #brat #360brat #erewhon #erewhonmarket #erewhonsmoothie
