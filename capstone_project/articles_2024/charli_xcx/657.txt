Vick Hope set pulses racing as she graced the red carpet at the MTV European Music Awards in Manchester on Sunday evening.
The Radio 1 DJ, 35, looked incredible in a sculpted bodice which she teamed with a matching white skirt for the annual event. 
Her skirt boasted racy thigh-high splits that perfectly showed off her long toned legs as she added extra height to her frame with GEDEBE Imaan heeled sandals in cocco sabia.
Vick's eye-catching ensemble was also adorned with fringe and she forwent a necklace opting instead for a gold bracelet and earrings. 
The stunner oozed confidence as she posed up a storm on the star-studded red carpet before taking her seat for the ceremony.
