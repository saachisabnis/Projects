There are a few rising artists poised to breakout in 2025, and Jillian Loux is near the top of the list. The Atlanta bedroom-pop performer releases new EP Granted later this month, and sets a seductive tone for it with the stirring “Help Me Remember,” an infectious earworm about struggling to let your guard down after the conclusion of a long-term relationship.
The buoyant alt-pop bop was produced by Frequency (Tate McRae, Rihanna, Eminem) and co-written by Nat Dunn (Charli XCX, ZAYN, Anne-Marie, Blackpink), so it’s clear Lady Loux already has some heathy musical muscle in her corner.  
“After a long relationship It’s easy to feel lost when it comes to love,” she says about the track. “‘Help Me Remember’ is meant to express those feelings you get when you finally begin to start opening up to someone new. It’s about the struggle to let your walls down all over again.”
“Help Me Remember” arrived on Friday (November 8) complete with a confessional visual directed by MOOD INFINITE. “For the video, I wanted it to be a fun play on the initial meaning of the song where this new situation-ship boy is the worst person ever,” Loux adds. “Obviously if that’s the case, the only thing you can do is kidnap them and lock them in a closet… but like, in a sexy way ;).”
We likely won’t need help remembering Jillian Loux anytime soon.
