Katy Perry showed Us her underwear at the 2024 Billboard Women in Music Awards.
At the Wednesday, March 6, ceremony in Los Angeles, Perry, 39, graced the red carpet in a red hot two-piece by Ellie Misner. The skin-baring design featured a waist-cinching corset and a lace-up skirt that exposed her bare bum in a black G-string. Just above the thong was a flesh-colored prosthetic tattoo of a butterfly. 
Perry drew attention to her back ink via Instagram on Wednesday, posting a carousel of images of her outfit with the caption, “You’re my butterfly, sugar, baby” — lyrics from Crazy Town’s “Butterfly.” (Fans seem to think the design is Perry teasing new music. “NEW ERA????” one fan wrote in the comments section as a second suggested, “She’s up to something!”) 
Perry contrasted the bold outfit with dainty accessories, including a pearl necklace and pearl-drop earrings. She wore her hair up in a Rapunzel-like ponytail, complete with micro bangs. For glam, the hitmaker opted for sharp brows, wispy lashes and a bright red lip.
