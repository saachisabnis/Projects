Just call it a blush with fame.
With so many cheek color trends going viral right now — from “sunset blush” to “boyfriend blush” — it’s hard to keep up.
But while it seems everything’s coming up roses (or should we say, rosy?) online in recent months, the below formulas have been Hollywood favorites for far longer.
Read on for the best blushes stars swear by — from Hailey Bieber’s favorite flushed-cheek hack to Meghan Markle’s pink powder pick.
Pros:
Cons:
It’s not rare to see celebs and beauty editors reaching for Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty blush.
Bella Hadid keeps a mini vial in her beauty drawer, while Mindy Kaling layered two different shades in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video, saying, “I think it looks so pretty, even if it’s the only makeup that I’m wearing.”
Page Six Style’s review: “This is the blush that changed my mind about blush,” says Page Six Style Editor Elana Fishman. “It’s so pigmented that I only need one dot on each cheek, so a single tube will last you ages; it’s a great value. It also blends beautifully, lasts hours and hours and looks really natural.”
“I wasn’t a huge blush fan prior to trying Rare Beauty’s liquid formula, but the formula converted me,” adds Page Six Commerce Reporter Hannah Southwick. “It’s a lot easier to apply than it looks — not to mention it’s super blendable, even if you over-apply at first.”
Pros:
Cons:
Celebrity makeup artist Gucci Westman’s worked with famous faces like Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow over the years, so it’s no surprise her blush sticks are just as celeb-coveted. (Case in point: She even used the pink-peachy shade Minette on Aniston for an Allure cover shoot in 2022.)
Westman’s blush stick also has a place in Martha Stewart’s beauty bag, while Storm Reid, Camilla Cabello, Brie Larson and Michelle Yeoh have all name-dropped it in interviews.
Pros:
Cons:
Nars’ powder blush — in the blush-inducing shade Orgasm, to be specific — is a longtime Hollywood staple. Kim Kardashian reportedly called it her “all-time favorite blush,” while Margot Robbie told Harper’s Bazaar it plays a role in her everyday makeup routine.
Meghan Markle, meanwhile, raved about the peachy-pink shade in her “Suits” days, telling Allure, “I use it on and off camera because it gives you a nice glow from within.”
Beauty pros are also on board; Patti Dubroff, who works with the likes of Sofia Richie and Kirsten Dunst, included it in a list of “products that are forever perfect” in a Teen Vogue interview.
Page Six Style’s review: “I have a few favorite blushes that I like to rotate, but I keep coming back to Nars Orgasm because it just looks so gorgeous on,” says Fishman, while Page Six Style Writer Kristin Contino adds, “The pinky-coral shade flatters absolutely everyone.”
Style Senior Writer/Editor Melissa Minton loves the brand’s Afterglow Liquid Blush ($32) in the same cheeky shade, which she combines with the Dolce Vita hue “for a slightly dimensional look — with Orgasm on the apples of my cheeks and Dolce Vita on the outer brown bone and temple.”
Adds Minton, “The formula blends like a dream and has a very subtle ‘glass skin’ effect that gives a lit-from-within glow.”
Pros:
Cons:
Plenty of stars’ backstage routines include Dior blush. Rita Ora and Ariana Grande both used the viral powder product in their respective Vogue “Beauty Secrets” videos, with the “7 Rings” singer even brushing some into her eyebrows after dusting it across her cheeks. 
Hailey Bieber also praised the high-end hue in her “Beauty Secrets” segment, saying, “This one is super beautiful and gives this baby pink glow.”
Pros:
Cons:
Talk about gold medal-worthy makeup. Suni Lee told Page Six Style she swears by this two-in-one beauty buy, which features both cream and powder shades.
“I love all Patrick Ta’s makeup but this is one of my favorites,” the gold medalist explained. “[She’s Blushing is] the perfect pink and something I always wear on and off the mat.”
She’s not the only one flipping over the cute compact, as Emily Ratajkowski and Brooke Shields have both worn the product, too. 
Pros:
Cons:
This portable blush has merited plenty of celebrity hype. Hailey Bieber name-checked the formula before launching her own Rhode blushes, while “The Summer I Turned Pretty” star Lola Tung uses it for her sun-kissed looks.
“I love it,” she raved in a Vogue video, matching the Raspberry Beret shade to bold berry-hued lipstick. 
Page Six Style’s Review: “If I had to pick one blush that has it all — compact size, easy to apply and perfect color for my complexion — I’d choose the Merit Flush Balm in Beverly Hills,” says Minton.
“I use it nearly every day in the fall and winter months to add a little peachiness to my face when I’m lacking a tan. No bronzer needed on light makeup days, either!” 
Pros:
Cons:
Stars are swiping right, so to speak, on this swipe-and-go formula. Mindy Kaling included it in an Instagram roundup of holiday gift picks — “I legitimately love and use all these things,” she assured viewers — while Brooke Shields, Haley Lu Richardson and Camila Mendes have all shouted it out in Vogue videos.
“It’s really creamy and light,” the latter “Riverdale” star said. “So the more I blend it in, the more it kind of disappears, which I like.” 
Pros:
Cons:
Leave it to makeup master Pat McGrath to create one of celebrities’ favorite cheek tints. Tyla’s a major fan, as she swiped some on in a Vogue video. Meanwhile, Serena Wiliams proved the powder works just as well on the go when she applied hers in a moving car for a TikTok. 
For those who prefer a blush stick, the brand’s Divine Cream Blush: Legendary Glow Color Balm ($29) has earned rave reviews, too.
Pros:
Cons:
Emma Roberts sang Chanel’s praises in a Vogue video, tapping this featherweight formula onto her cheekbones. “Emily in Paris” makeup artist Aurélie Payen is also a fan of the brand’s blush offerings, and uses its No. 1 de Chanel Lip and Cheek Balm ($48) on set.
“If you want to have the French-girl look, working with a lot of blush [will] give glow,” she told us in 2023.
Pros:
Cons:
Erin Lichy’s favorite blush costs far less than a Tribeca condo. The real estate mogul-turned-“RHONY” star shouted out this Revlon formula in an interview with Page Six Style, saying, “I’ve been obsessed with this blush serum lately … [Striking Rose is] the perfect rosy color that makes me look like I laid out in the sun for 10 minutes too long.”
She’s not the only one stocking up; Ashley Graham wore the Beaming Coral shade to the 2024 Met Gala. 
Pros:
Cons:
Another highlight of stars’ beauty bags? Charlotte Tilbury’s blush wands, a red carpet mainstay packed with both pigment and subtle shimmer.
Plenty of stars are enamored; Nicola Coughlan included the Pinkgasm shade in her Vogue “Beauty Secrets” segment, raving, “It just makes you look really fresh and glowy.”
And beauty influencer Meredith Duxbury shouted out the same shade in a chat with Page Six Style, noting it “blends really nicely on top of other products.”
Pros:
Cons:
“Brat summer” is here. And what better way to get into the spirit than with Charli XCX’s favorite blush?
“I’m kind of into this whole E-girl thing where it’s this vibe,” the “360” singer told Vogue while swiping a straight line of blush across her nose and cheeks. “I don’t want to speak out of turn here, but I think it’s an evolution of Tumblr-girl style.” 
Page Six Style’s review: “Milk Makeup’s blush sticks were the first blushes I ever tried — and considering they’re so easy to apply (and blend in like a dream) I’d recommend them to fellow blush newbies or anyone who prefers a stick-style formula over liquid and powder options,” says Southwick.
Pros:
Cons:
Leave it to a “Barbie” star to find the perfect pink blush. Issa Rae whipped out this blush-eyeshadow combo while detailing her dry skin routine for Vogue. And Myricks, the brains behind the formula, is a professional makeup artist beloved by fellow industry pros, including Gayle King’s go-to glam artist Rae Dawn. 
While the the perfect blush boils down to personal preference, celebrity makeup artist Kelli Anne Sewell — who works with stars like Alex Cooper, Paige DeSorbo and Brooks Nader — recommends a cream formula for the easiest application.
“I love the hydration that it gives to the skin, and I find they’re the most user friendly,” she tells Page Six Style, explaining that you can also layer cream and powder formulas for longer wear, given “blush is always the first thing to fade.”
“My favorite blush toppers [are] typically baked formulas and mineralized powder, which means they are a bit more sheer …. [they] layer beautifully over cream formulas,” explains the Makeup by Kelli Anne founder, who likes using Kylie Cosmetics Pressed Powder Blush in Winter Kissed on Alex Cooper. 
While there’s no one correct way to apply blush — and fresh trends are constantly emerging — Sewell recommends a technique called “shadow blush,” which entails picking two shades: an “earthier, muted-tone” and a “more bright vibrant color, such as a baby doll or poppy pink.”
She starts by blending the muted shade across the outer realms of the face, and then concentrating the more vibrant color on the apples of the cheeks. 
“You want the highest point of the cheek to be accentuated by the vibrant color, but blended seamlessly with the rest of the face with the muted color,” she instructs.
