Laneige’s famous fans have something new to smile about.
The K-beauty brand’s cult-favorite Lip Sleeping Mask ($24) is a staple for stars like Kate Hudson, Kyle Richards and Alix Earle — and now, the Laneige is expanding its lineup with the new Bouncy & Firm Plumping Lip Treatment ($26). 
While the brand’s original lip mask is intended for nighttime use, the new treatment — packed with collagen, ceramides and hyaluronic acid — is designed to plump and provide a boost of hydration at any time. 
Longtime Laneige ambassador Sydney Sweeney’s already given the pout product her stamp of approval; she posted on Instagram calling the drop — along with the corresponding Bouncy & Firm Eye Brightening Sleeping Mask ($36) and eye sleeping mask ($32) — “the pink skincare trio of my dreams.”
In its first days on the market, the product’s already racked up over 200 largely glowing reviews at Sephora. 
“It’s soothing and smoothing while not feeling sticky,” one satisfied shopper raved, while anther chimed in, “I have to say, Laneige makes the best lip masks period.”
Like its signature lip sleeping mask, the Laneige Lip Glowy Balm ($19) is a famous favorite; Simone Biles even swiped some on before her gold medal-winning routine in the Olympics all-around final last week.
In addition to actresses and Olympians, the brand’s fans also include Kendall Jenner, Brooke Shields and Charli XCX.
The “Brat” chart-topper even makes a 360 when she forgets hers at home, telling British Vogue, “I have turned Ubers around before … If I had enough money, I would turn the plane around too.”
With so many fans smitten with the original salve, Laneige’s Bouncy & Firm version seems destined to become a Hollywood hit.
