Kim Gordon may be expanding her list of “pop icons.”
The Sonic Youth bassist/vocalist has shared a video of her trying Charli XCX‘s viral “Apple” dance, which has been popular among celebrities. The dance is inspired by a song off Charli’s new hit album, Brat.
Gordon writes in the caption, “#flungbrat.”
In a recent interview with The Guardian, Gordon shared, “When it comes to pop icons, I would choose Billie Eilish.” She also said that she’s “not really a fan of Taylor Swift,” adding, “I couldn’t tell you what her music sounded like, actually.”
Gordon debuted a new solo single, “ECRP,” in June. It follows her new album, The Collective, which dropped in March.
