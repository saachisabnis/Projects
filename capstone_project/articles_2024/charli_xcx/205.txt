 Buy her exact set rn!!
ICYMI, Sabrina Carpenter is having her moment this year – from gracing a Cosmo UK cover to debuting the song of the summer (‘Espresso’ or ‘Please Please Please’, take your pick) to announcing her Short n’ Sweet tour—which, FYI, the full album drops on 23 August. Her latest takeover? Launching her own smoothie at the buzzy, celeb-loved LA grocery store Erewhon, following in the likes of Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner. 
Sabrina took to IG to announce the blue smoothie (which is appropriately named “Short n’ Sweet”), wearing a matching blue knit coordinating set from It Girl brand, GUIZIO. And while UK fans may not be able to get in on trying her smoothie from this side of the pond, you can steal her style and buy Sabrina’s exact same GUIZIO Knit Crop Top and Pleated Mini Skirt that you’ll no doubt wear again and again.
The equally short n’ sweet blue lace-trimmed crop tank and mini skirt set features bow details and is available in sizes XXS-XL. Whether you’re looking for a summer wardrobe boost or something to wear to Sabrina’s upcoming Short n’ Sweet tour, this lil set is add-to-basket-worthy. But I know each piece costs over £100, which is def a bit of a splurge, so I found some more affordable options below that offer the same vibe if you’re looking to save some £££: 
Sabrina isn’t the only pop star rocking the super trendy and cool brand GUIZIO rn—Charli XCX was just seen this past week in GUIZIO wearing the Soffiano Set. I think it’s pretty safe to say that the brand is also brat-summer-approved, no?
