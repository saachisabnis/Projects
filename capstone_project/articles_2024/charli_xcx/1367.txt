Britney Spears made it abundantly clear to fans that she has no intention of ever returning to music.
She posted her dramatic update on Instagram on Wednesday in response to media claims that she was lining up artists and songwriters for the creation of her 10th studio album. “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash!!!” she wrote. “They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry !!!” Spears said.

She went on to explain her position and debunked rumors that suggested she had enlisted Charli XCX and Julia Michaels to collaborate with her on the creation of new music.
“When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!!” she said.
The 42-year-old pop icon said she has no interest in being in the spotlight and resuming a full-blown music career but continues to contribute to the world of music in her own way.
“For those of you who have read my book, there’s loads that you don’t know about me … I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!!” she said, noting her current involvement.

Spears expressed that she was fulfilling her passion in an adjusted manner than the way fans may have hoped.
“I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!” she said.
After making it clear that she doesn’t wish to reprise her role as the Princess of Pop by taking center stage anytime soon, Spears also addressed rumors that were swirling around her memoir, “The Woman in Me.”
“People are also saying MY BOOK WAS RELEASED WITHOUT MY APPROVAL ILLEGALLY and that’s far from the truth … have you read the news these days ??? I’m so LOVED and blessed !!!” Spears said.

Rolling Stone reported that just “minutes before” Spears released this statement to her Instagram page, a source “close to the Spears project-in-the-works” told them her team was trying to get her back into the studio. (RELATED: Iggy Azalea Abruptly Abandons Her Music Career)
“Right now, management and A&R are trying to get her excited for the music. As of right now, she’s not actively in recording but they’re getting [songs] done to present to her,” the source told Rolling Stone.
“Nothing is cemented or in stone. … The hype around this is that everyone wants her to make music again, but I don’t know if she’s there yet,” the source said, according to Rolling Stone.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.
