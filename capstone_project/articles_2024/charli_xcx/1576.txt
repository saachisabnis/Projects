	Britney Spears has something up her sleeves.

	The pop superstar took to social media on Friday (Jan. 12) to share a brief teaser clip. “Something’s coming,” the screen reads, as “…Baby One More Time” plays in the background. Spears’ debut hit is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. She also linked a mailing list for fans to stay in the loop.

	While Spears didn’t indicate exactly what she’ll be releasing, the star recently revealed that she won’t be dropping music any time soon. “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash,” she wrote in a lengthy caption via Instagram earlier this month. “They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry !!!”
