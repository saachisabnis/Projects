Kathryn Hahn knows the impact her role as Agatha Harkness in the hit Marvel show WandaVision had on viewers, and she is reflecting on how "rad" it was to watch that scene — and the subsequent fan reactions — unfold.
The Step Brothers star appeared on Wednesday's (September 18) episode of the Las Culturistas podcast hosted by Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang, where they talked about everything from fan theories and keeping secrets to working with her "dear friend" and fellow Parks & Recreation alum Aubrey Plaza and the "incredible" Patti LuPone on their new show Agatha All Along, a WandaVision spinoff series started streaming September 18 on Disney+.
Yang noted that WandaVision felt very "monocultural" because it came out during the height of the pandemic and "it was like we're all watching the same thing for once" so when the reveal happened with Hahn's character, he wondered what it must have been like for her to keep such a big secret.
"Because it was the pandemic and because I don't have social media, I could really just live my life," she said. "Didn't tell my kids, they kind of forgot about it. So it was just like we were able to watch it live at home, and that was really, really satisfying because that big reveal is hilarious."
Hahn added that it was "pretty rad" while Rogers said that scene was now an "iconic moment in television."
When it came to other fan theories, however, Hahn didn't have much of an issue with keeping secrets. 
"No, it actually kinda makes the whole thing a little f---ing easier because there's nothing you can say," she said, adding, "We get to talk about anything."
On Las Culturistas, Rogers and Yang "get into the hottest pop-culture moments of the day" and even hang out with special guests like Mandy Moore, Charli XCX and Ben Platt, to name a few. Check out more episodes of the Las Culturistas podcast at iHeartRadio.com.
