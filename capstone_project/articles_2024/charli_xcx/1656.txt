After Britney Spears vowed she would â€˜never returnâ€™ to the music industry earlier this year, the Toxic hitmaker has announced a surprise career move.
The 00s icon, 42, made her mark as one of the biggest popstars in the world with hits including Oops.. I did it again, Everytime, and Piece of Me, and now sheâ€™s turned her attention to a jewellery line. 
Taking to social media to announce her new venture, Britney posted a picture of a delicate bracelet looped around her middle finger, and announced: â€˜My first jewellery line coming soon!!!â€™
Marketing the â€˜one of a kindâ€™ pieces as â€˜delicate and extremely differentâ€™, Britney said she was â€˜so excitedâ€™ for the launch, and announced the name as B Tiny. 
â€˜Realising how cool it is to be an artist that can be passionate in so many different ways !!!â€™ she wrote, before ending the post with: â€˜B Tiny coming soon ðŸŒ·!!! Girls youâ€™re gonna f**king love it!!!â€™
In January Britney shut down rumours she was potentially joining forces with Brat superstar Charli XCX toÂ record a new album and declared her popstar career as officially over.
Slamming the album speculation as â€˜trashâ€™, Britney wrote: â€˜Just so weâ€™re clear most of the news is trash !!!Â They keep saying Iâ€™m turning to random people to do a new album â€¦ I will never return to the music industry !!!â€™
In 1999 Britney rocketed to international stardom on the release of her debut album Baby One More Time, and her follow up Oopsâ€¦ I Did It Again. 
Her declaration about quitting the industry 25 years on from finding fame comes three years after the pop iconâ€™s crippling conservatorship was lifted, freeing her from 13 years under the complete control of her father.
In her memoir, Britney said the conservatorship stole her â€˜womanhoodâ€™ and she also detailed how it destroyed her love for performance.
Her father â€˜taking over everythingâ€™ was the â€˜worst thingâ€™ that could â€˜possibly ever happenâ€™ to Britneyâ€™s â€˜music, career, and sanity,â€™ she wrote.
â€˜I began to think that he saw me as put on the earth for no other reason than to help their cash flow,â€™ she wrote, adding that her father once uttered the words: â€˜Iâ€™m Britney Spears now.â€™
â€˜As far as my passion for singing and dancing, it was almost a joke at that point,â€™ wrote Britney, speaking about her time under the conservatorship.
Britney described that she became a â€˜child-robotâ€™ having lost her womanhood. She became an â€˜entityâ€™, rather than a person on stage, the star explained.
â€˜I always felt I had music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me,â€™ she wrote.
Despite saying she would never return to the music industry, in the same breath Britney also revealed she has been writing music. 
Britney added: â€˜When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!! For those of youÂ who have read my book, thereâ€™s loads that you donâ€™t know about me â€¦ Iâ€™ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!!
â€˜Iâ€™m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!â€™
