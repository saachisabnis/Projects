SKIMS keeps making power moves. Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand is one of the hottest brands around. According to the recent edition of The Lyst Index, SKIMS is the 12th most in-demand label of the quarter, just behind Versace and in front of Moncler. It certainly helps that Kardashian has managed to cast some major stars in the brand's advertising campaigns, like Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX. Now SKIMS is releasing a collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana that's all about la dolce vita.
It's only natural that the trio would collaborate once again after Kardashian curated Dolce & Gabbana's Spring 2023 offering. Dolce & Gabbana x SKIMS takes the Italian fashion house's sultry vibes and marries them with SKIMS' signature "fabrics and figuring-shaping styles." Expect lots of leopard and mesh. These pieces are made to be seen with many silhouettes designed to be worn both in and out of the bedroom.
