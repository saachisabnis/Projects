It was reported earlier this week that Britney Spears had recruited people like Julia Michaels and Charli XCX to write songs for a new album, but Rolling Stone confirmed that it was actually Britney's team who reached out. “Right now, management and A&R are trying to get her excited for the music,” the source says. “As of right now, she’s not actively in recording but they’re getting songs done to present to her.” But Britney herself responded to the reports yesterday in a fiery Instagram post. “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash !!! They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry,” she declared. “When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!!” Still, Spears has released songs with Elton John and Will.i.am in recent years.
