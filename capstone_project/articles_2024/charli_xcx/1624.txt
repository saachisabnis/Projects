Glastonbury festival enthusiasts are eager to discover who's set to grace this year's line-up, with recent whispers suggesting this British musician might make the list. In a whirlwind of speculation and unconfirmed gossip, Sam Fender has emerged as a potential act believed to be gracing the event.
Recently, Sam had to scrap a series of shows through to end of the current year due to a torn vocal cord that required him to enforce a strict voice rest. Announcing the upsetting decision on social platforms, Sam expressed being "absolutely heartbroken" about the cancellations, mentioning he was warned by two different medical professionals about the "risking lasting damage" he faced should he push forward with performances.
He is scheduled to resume live gigs in February across the pond, followed by a tour through Europe come springtime – conveniently ahead of Glastonbury Festival. Fans on Reddit are buzzing with the notion that Sam Fender will triumphantly return and climb onto the iconic Pyramid Stage at Worthy Farm.
Amid fervent fan discussions, one enthusiast crafted a hypothetical poster of the anticipated roster they're hoping for at the festival. Yet, while the excitement bubbles, some have noted the absence of Sam Fender from the speculative graphic.
"Interesting, I do reckon it could be Sam Fender instead of the 1975, but do think Olivia and Neil also," speculated a user, while another chimed in, "Pretty close but I think it’ll be Sam fender instead of Neil young". These new speculations surface following The Sun's scoop that musical heavyweights Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, and Olivia Rodrigo are all expected to hit the stage at next year's Glastonbury.
They will be joining the likes of The 1975, Stevie Wonder, and Neil Young who are set to grace the Pyramid Stage. Rod Stewart has also confirmed his appearance in the coveted Legends slot on Sunday, which he described as "the greatest honour" to such an extent that he's splashing out £300,000 to ensure the event is flawless.
Other acts rumoured to be added to the lineup include Fleet Foxes, who will be touring the UK during the festival period, and rapper 50 Cent.
