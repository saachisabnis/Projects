	Engines are being warmed up on “One,” the drama series set in the world of Formula One racing that Felicity Jones is attached to both star in and executive produce. 

Variety understands that the series is in development with Amazon MGM Studios for Prime Video, although it has not been officially ordered yet.

	“One” — which marks Formula 1‘s first officially sanctioned scripted series — will focus on a failing family-owned racing team, led by Jones’ character, as it contends with fierce personalities, ever-changing rivals and multi-million-dollar stakes.

Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby — who were Oscar nominated for “Children of Men” — will write and executive produce.
