	The tune for their night out started out typical enough: “On our way to the function/ We smokin’ blunts and/ Feeling so alive/ All the honeys lookin’ scrumptious.”

	But things turned sour: “I think we got too high/ Smoked too much and I got scared/ Haven’t smoked since high school/ This is not fun/ If I close my eyes, am I still like, here?/ Am I standing normal?/ Where is Ramy?”

	Youssef, hosting SNL, was not partaking in the same party activity as everyone else, but was he was not fine. He got lost in his own anxiety at the club and probably had the worst time of all. Feeling out of place, he agonized over something stupid he’d said earlier in the evening: “We’re gonna have a twisted, rockin’ ball.” Relatable.

	“Man, why’d I bring them?” Scott wondered. “They’re actin’ crazy/ And why is that guy being held like a baby?”
