A Playboi Carti fan has accused the rapper of ordering his entourage to jump him hours before the rapper confirmed an album date. 
According to a video shared by the fan, it all stemmed from an autograph request. Apparently, Carti didn’t like the image he was asked to sign and snatched it away before ordering his crew to go after the fan. 
“About ten minutes ago, Playboi Carti’s crew jumped me and my girlfriend all because I wanted to ask him to sign my picture,” the fan claimed.  
The clip shows the fan approaching Playboi Carti’s vehicle with the photo in hand.  
“He took my picture and he told his gang, ‘Go get his phone from him,’” the fan continued. “Me and my girl ran and they chased us down. And what I did is I gave him my girlfriend’s phone because I have the video of him snatching it and getting angry.”    
The video then cuts to a chaotic scene, allegedly of Parti’s crew attempting to retrieve the phone. A woman can be heard screaming, “Stop! Get the f### off of me!”
