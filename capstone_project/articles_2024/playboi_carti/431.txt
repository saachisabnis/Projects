The music industry is grieving the loss of Rich Homie Quan, the Atlanta rapper known for songs including “Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh),” “Type of Way,” and Rich Gang’s “Lifestyle.” A family member confirmed the news of his death at 33 to both Rolling Stone and TMZ on September 5. Although rumors have circulated online that he overdosed, no official cause has been shared. Tributes have been pouring in from friends, collaborators, and listeners who remember dancing to his music when it played on the radio or in the club. Jacquees, a member of the Cash Money Records group Rich Gang that Rich Homie Quan was a part of with Young Thug, shared his condolences on X. “Rest in Peace my brother Rich Homie Quan,” he wrote. “I love you for Life. #Richgang.”
Quavo reacted to the news on his Instagram Story, sharing a friendly group photo of himself with several other rappers. Rich Homie Quan was honored with a dove emoji; the late Takeoff got a rocket emoji; Young Thug, who is still in jail and on trial, was acknowledged with a broken-chain emoji; and Offset, the Migos bandmate with whom Quavo has a complicated history, received a broken-heart emoji. “May God be with US never saw this being apart of our journey,” Quavo reflected in the caption. Below, find more remembrances for Rich Homie Quan from Flo Milli, Boosie Badazz, Playboi Carti, and more.
