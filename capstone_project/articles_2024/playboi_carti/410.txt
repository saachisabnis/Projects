Rich announced the news as he celebrated going No. 1 alongside the pair for the Vultures cut “Carnival,” which also features Playboi Carti.

“# 1 on billboard with family @ye @tydollasign & @playboicarti,” he wrote with a screenshot of this week’s Billboard Hot 100 chart. “Thank you to all the fans, my family that always support love! #V2 & My [new] album exec prod. by Ye & Ty$ OTW”
The carousel also included behind the scenes images alongside Ty and Ye as well as other recent moments in his career.
Rich The Kid first announced Life’s A Gamble back in January with an unspecified release date of Spring 2024. At the time, Kanye was reported to be a featured guest, as well as Offset, Travis Barker and Rob49.
The LP will be Rich’s first album in four years. His last effort, Boss Man, dropped in March 2020. Lil Baby, DaBaby, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, Lil Tjay, NBA YoungBoy, Quavo and more made appearances, but the project failed to make a big splash and soon dropped off the charts following a No. 24 debut on the Billboard 200.

In addition to Rich’s aforementioned post, Kanye West also took a moment to celebrate having the No. 1 song in the country – and used it as an opportunity to lash out at various perceived enemies.
In a since-deleted post on Instagram on Monday (March 11), West said: “Rich Ty Carti and the supporters that stood by us through everything This number #1 is for you. It’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system.

“And fuck adidas and everybody who works there or with them. Anyone who goes to school with anyone who’s parents work at adidas. Just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the number 1 song in the world.”
He continued: “Like the fake dude I saw in the lobby at the Ritz that works at Goat You pussys don’t stand for shit. And fuck everybody at the Dailey Mail [sic].

“And Fuck everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber Fuck each and every single one of yall And fuck every so called Christian and so called friend or so called family member that watched me have my kids taken out of my control.”
Kanye ended his message by taking a shot at longtime rival and sometimes friend Drake, who recently recruited West’s “Vultures” collaborator Lil Durk to join him on his It’s All a Blur — Big as the What? Tour.

“That’s how I feel And it’s fuck Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more fuck you’s,” he concluded.
