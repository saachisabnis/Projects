Playboi Carti is known for keeping fans waiting, and it seems that his highly-anticipated Antagonist tour is no different. The tour, originally set to start in September 2023 with shows in February this year, has been rescheduled once more. The Orlando's Kia Center website states that his January 25 performance has been postponed, with no new date announced. As of now, this is the only officially postponed show, but all previous tour dates have been removed from Playboi Carti's website. 
Although the postponed Florida date may be an isolated incident, fans have expressed disappointment over continuous delays on social media. This news has also raised questions about Playboi Carti's upcoming album, believed to be titled "I Am Music or Music", expected to be released this month. DJ Akademiks shared a Tweet in December revealing the rumored release window and praised the project as "the greatest thing you ever heard." Fans are now eagerly awaiting updates on Playboi Carti's tour and album. 
Despite the tour setbacks, Playboi Carti has released several new tracks in recent weeks, including "2024," "H00DBYAIR," "Over," and a collaboration with Travis Scott on "BACKR00MS," receiving praise from fellow artists Kanye West and Ice Spice. What are your thoughts on Playboi Carti's tour postponements? Do you plan to attend his live performance? Are you anticipating his upcoming album?
