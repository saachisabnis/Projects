North West is following in her parents’ footsteps as she now seems to be embracing her status as a public figure.
On Friday (March 15), the 10-year-old rising star had a brief on-camera chat with social media figure and fellow child star Jazzy on the first night of Rolling Loud California.
After thanking Kim Kardashian for setting up the interview, the reporter and actress asked her guest about the release of Elementary School Dropout, to which North replied: “It’s gonna be great.”

However, the rookie musician didn’t have a clear answer for whether or not Kanye West will be on the album, saying: “Maybe! We don’t know yet!”
Additionally, she didn’t reveal when the album would be released either.
Watch their conversation below:
Ye’s eldest child recently announced her debut album, the title of which is a reference to her father’s breakthrough project.
In early March, she stood side by side with the Chicago native during the Vultures 2 listening event in Phoenix, Arizona and said to the roaring crowd: “I’ve been working on an album and it is called Elementary School Dropout.”

The name of the album, of course, is a nod to Ye’s 2004 landmark debut The College Dropout.
The news came shortly after she made her debut as a musician on Kanye and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Talking,” which was released on their Vultures 1 album.
The track peaked at No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100, making her one of the youngest artists ever to appear on the chart.

On the song, she raps: “I love it here/ We’re gonna take over another year/ It’s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie/ Don’t try to test me/ It’s gonna get messy/ Just, just bless me, bless me/ It’s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie.”
Kanye also brought out his two youngest children, Psalm and Chicago, while their older sister performed the above song at Inglewood’s Hollywood Park Grounds over the weekend.

At the listening party, Ye and Ty Dolla $ign played eight songs from the forthcoming Vultures 2, which include collaborations with Future, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk, Project Pat, Don Toliver and 070 Shake.
West is currently considering selling the album directly to his fans instead of sharing it on streaming services. He recently told social media fan account YeFantatics, with whom he has been communicating over the past week, that he is contemplating selling the record on his website for $20.
