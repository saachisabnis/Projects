On Friday (August 23), Drake shared three new brand new songs via his Instagram burner account, @plottttwistttttt. The new tracks are titled “Supersoak (SOD),” “Circadian Rhythm (The Language 2),” and “No Face,” which features Playboi Carti. The new version of “Supersoak” is notable because it no longer features a guest spot from Lil Yachty, which it did on the original version that was circulating earlier. A rift is rumored between Drake and Yachty, after Yachty leaked an early version of “Supersoak” that featured his verse, even though they couldn’t get clearance on a  sample from Mr. HotSpot that was included on the track. 
Yachty unfollowed Drake on Instagram as a result of the disagreement. “Circadian Rhythm” could be a reference to a line on Kendrick Lamar’s Drake diss track “6:16 in LA,” while “No Face” contains many lines that could be heard as lyrical responses to his ongoing beef with Kendrick as well as his long-running feud with Metro Boomin. These three new tracks arrive weeks after the Canadian rapper dropped a massive folder of unreleased music, behind-the-scenes footage, and studio clips. (Variety)
