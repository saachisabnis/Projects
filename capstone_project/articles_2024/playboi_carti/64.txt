Iggy Azalea won’t be finishing her fourth album. 
The “Fancy” rapper, 33, announced on Wednesday that she will be stepping away from music entirely to focus on other creative ventures. 
“I know a lot of people have this idea that I was ‘bullied away from music’ and that’s something I’ve always laughed at because I’d never be bullied out of anything!” she wrote in a lengthy message to fans via X.
“In fact, I’m too stubborn,” she added. “I think I’ve even resisted changes within myself at times, purely because I don’t like being viewed as someone who quits.” 
Azalea’s last musical release came in September 2023, when she dropped the “Money Come (Remix)” with Big Boss Vette. 
She now “[feels] more passionately about design and creative direction” than she does about songwriting, though.

“That’s why I want to let you know that I’m not going to finish my album,” Azalea continued, adding that the project has been on pause “for months” while she was tending to other business opportunities. 
“In truth I just haven’t felt the urge to go back to it,” she explained. 
“I feel really happy & passionate in my day to day life when my minds focused on that and so I want to stick to what’s undeniably best for me.” 
The Australian hitmaker — who released her debut studio LP, “The New Classic,” in 2014 — did acknowledge supporters who may be hoping for future tunes. 
“I know for some fans this probably makes you feel a little deflated – I’m sorry to let you down,” she wrote. 
“But, it’s more important I don’t let myself down. I hope youll understand.”
One of Azalea’s last live performances occurred in Saudi Arabia in August 2023, during which her pants split onstage — and she had to cut her set short because of the wardrobe malfunction. 
“Saudi Arabia… Wasssssss…. probably the worst possible place to have my pants split & unfortunately I wasn’t permitted to end the show. 🤷‍♀️🥲,” she captioned a slideshow on Instagram that showed clips from the show, including the moment her pants ripped.
The mother of one — who shares son Onyx, 3, with ex Playboi Carti — elaborated, “BUT silver lining. The promoters were amazingly kind to me & the PEOPLE who came were the absolute most supportive.”
