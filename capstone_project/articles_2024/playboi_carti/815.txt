Metro Boomin revealed that someone from Canada hacked his account, switched his number to another phone provider, and sent off tweets from his account.
Hitting X, Metro provided an update to fans.
“Jus got my phone # and accounts back today somebody hacked me the day the album dropped smh,” Metro wrote. “And all those corny ass tweets all my day 1s know that’s nowhere in my character.”
He would go on to reveal a tweet sending a subliminal to 21 Savage was not from him: “What I look like subbing savage and we were on the phone for an hour 2 days ago. Y’all shoulda known something was up then but negativity and bad news travels faster and further than anything else.”
