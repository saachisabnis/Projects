Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign appear to have released several songs from their Vultures 2 album but through unconventional means.
Those expecting to find the songs on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music will be disappointed, but multiple tracks are currently available on TikTok and Instagram.

As noticed by several Kanye fan accounts, “River” featuring Young Thug and Leon Bridges and the Backstreet Boys-sampling “Everybody” were available to stream on the social media platforms and could be added as tracks to posts.
Further songs from Vultures 2 were also available including “Worship,” “Promotion” featuring Future, the James Blake-assisted “Slide” and “Field Trip,” which is said to feature Playboi Carti, Kodak Black, Lil Durk and Don Toliver.
The same tracks also appeared on TikTok.
While the songs’ availability would suggest they were officially released by Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, the fan account Ye Fanatics claimed that they are simply low-quality rips uploaded by fans.
“The songs from Vultures 2 that were released yesterday are from a fan group,” they wrote on X. “The audios are distorted and sound bad.

“A Vultures producer contacted me today to clarify this. We hope to see a change in the next few hours or we will have to wait a little longer for the album to be available.”
Neither Ye nor Ty Dolla have yet commented on the availability of the songs nor the album, which was previously scheduled to arrive last week but has since been delayed.
While a new release date has yet to be announced, Kanye recently indicated that Vultures 2 wouldn’t be released on streaming services and would instead be available to purchase directly through his website.
“We sell albums on Yeezy.com. I got 20 million instagram followers. When 5% of my followers buy an album [t]hat’s 1 million albums sold[.] That’s 300k more than the biggest album last year,” he wrote in a DM to Ye Fanatics.

“We sold 1 million items on Yeezy.com on Super Bowl Sunday so we know it’s possible. How do you feel about us not streaming and only selling the album digitally[?]”
He also said he wanted to sell copies of Vultures 2 for $20 each, which is around double what an album is typically sold for.

Ty Dolla $ign appears on board with the decision as he commented: “That’s what these streaming services want u to to believe so they can stay on top. Music cost us money and time to make but they don’r want us to get paid for it.
“There selling the audience subscriptions and renting our music out while giving us a fraction of a penny [crying laughter emoji]. I hear what you’re saying but we’re already #1 with the first.”

He concluded: “It’s time to figure out the unlock on how to bring the music straight to our audience and cut the middle man out. Artists are getting raped and that has to stop.”
The release of Vultures 1 last month ran into a number of issues including a copyright lawsuit over the Donna Summer-sampling “Good (Don’t Die)” and a distribution complaint that temporarily led to the album being removed from streaming platforms.
