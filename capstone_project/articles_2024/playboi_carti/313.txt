Camila Cabello has returned with a new single called I Luv It.
The collaboration with rapper Playboi Carti includes a sample of Gucci Mane’s 2009 song Lemonade, and follows the former Fifth Harmony member’s 2022 album ’Familia’. She also teamed up with Oxlade for a remix of Ku Lo Sa and contributed to the Trolls Band Together soundtrack.
Written by the pop star and recorded with executive producer El Guincho and co-producer Jasper Harris, it comes with a cinematic video directed by Nicolás Méndez, below. Introducing the track, Cabello said:
"Certain things in our human realm do make me feel like I’m in outer space, and the very rare few times where I’ve had incredible chemistry with someone is one of them.  Part of that cocktail is also the emotional drama between you and that person, and the chaos and butterflies and nerves and passion. It’s unsustainable and not peaceful and exhausting, but also, I LUV IT."
Cabello is set to appear at this year’s Glastonbury Festival.
