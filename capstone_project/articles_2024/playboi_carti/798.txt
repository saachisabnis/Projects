Big Boi is incredulous after a woman questioned whether he and fellow Dungeon Family member Sleepy Brown were “migrants” when they stepped out to get something to eat.
The Outkast legend shared the story on X in a post on Wednesday (September 3).

The pair are currently on the road with Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue and are in California ahead of their Los Angeles tour stop on Thursday at the Hollywood Bowl.
“We’re on the tour bus in Cali right… we stopped for breakfast…,” he began. “why this lady ask sleepy brown  ‘Are ya’ll migrants being dropped off ‘ …Bish What ?”

In other news, Big Boi fans are not happy with his placement on a recent top 50 Atlanta rappers list put together by Complex.
While the list was expectedly topped by his partner in rhyme André 3000, Big Boi came in at the eighth spot on the list below Future, T.I., Gucci Mane, Jeezy, Young Thug and Ludacris.

Fans were not impressed with Big Boi being put outside of the top 5 given his impressive catalog of hits both with OutKast and as a solo artist.
One fan commented: “The Big Boi disrespect is corny as fuck and the normalization of it is pure bullshit. Also, 90% of this list can’t rhyme with Big Boi, Andre 3000, CeeLo, and Killer Mike. If it’s REALLY ABOUT RAP, if OutKast, CeeLo, and Killer Mike aren’t in the ATL’s top five, it’s a joke.”

Another criticized how he can often be overlooked in favor of Three Stacks: “The way Big Boi is routinely disrespected needs to be studied. You would think the way they rank him that he wasn’t the one with a solo catalogue and that he got washed on Outkast albums…”
One fan pointed out how Big Boi should be nearer the top if André is number one: “There’s no justification for putting Andre at 1 and Big Boi outside of the top 5 bruh.”

This was echoed by another who said: “I agree that Andre is great but the Big Boi disrespect is insane — Always has been but this is egregious.”
It was also argued: “To me the only rappers on Big Boi level out of Atlanta are 3k and TI. Them the only people you can argue over him and with TI is a very close one.”

The list also controversially placed Killer Mike at 14, below younger rappers such as Playboi Carti, Offset and Lil Baby.
Some fans were also annoyed that J.I.D. was at 27, just one spot above Soulja Boy and below the likes of Latto and Lil Yachty.
