Quavo has crossed paths with a fan who went above and beyond to show his admiration for the rapper, demonstrating his global reach.
A video shared on Instagram on Saturday (February 24) finds the Atlanta rapper having an awkward encounter with a male bystander, who upon taking off his shirt revealed a full back tattoo.

The tattoo, consisting of the rapper’s face was accompanied by more ink, that appeared to be Post Malone.
Although it’s unclear where the pair crossed paths it’s likely to have occurred at Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Vultures Listening Experience” at Milan’s Mediolanum Forum on Thursday (February 22).
Ye and Ty, who began the European leg of their Vultures 1 tour last week, were joined on stage by a long list of A-list celebrities including Quavo, Playboi Carti, Freddie Gibbs, Rich the Kid and Jaden Smith.
This latest fan interaction comes after Quavo had a similar moment in late 2023. While traveling through Japan, Huncho spotted a fan rocking a vintage-styled TakeOff t-shirt, paying tribute to his nephew.

Quavo asked for the TakeOff shirt right off the obliging fan’s back; and the rapper appeared to return the favor by forking over some cash.
“Let me see that shirt boy. Yeah, you got that motherfucker on. Oh that shit hard. Where you get this? Let me get one, please. Can I have it. I want it, yes,” he asked the fan.

“Thank you, bro. Hold on, what you want? I’ll give you some money for it. Let me take my camera off ya chest.”
Fans and friends loved to see the interaction thousands of miles away from the Migos’ hometown of Atlanta.

“That’s a real 1 right there hahahaha,” collaborator Murda Beatz wrote, while a fan commented: “MY BOY GON FOREVER REMEMBER THAT DAY QUAVO MADE HIM GIVE THE SHIRT!”
TakeOff was tragically shot following a “lucrative” dice game outside 810 Billiards & Bowling in Houston, Texas on November 1, 2022. Take was believed to have been an innocent bystander when things turned sour.
