Camila Cabello has announced that her new album, C,XOXO, is set to be released on June 28. Following the great reception of her recent single, “I LUV IT,” which featured a guest appearance by Playboi Carti, the former Fifth Direction singer has shared the release date and album art for her fourth record via an Instagram post. C,XOXO will arrive a little over two years after Cabello’s 2022 LP, Familia, which featured the singles “Don’t Go Yet” and the Ed Sheeran-assisted “Bam Bam,” and reached No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart following its release.
