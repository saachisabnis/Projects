This past weekend, Travis Scott was the guest performer on Saturday Night Live. The Houston-rapper performed his hits from UTOPIA including “MY EYES” and even “FE!N.” Travis Scott surprised the crowd by bringing out Playboi Carti to help perform “FE!N.”
On the official Cactus Jack Instagram, the team revealed that Scott enlisted Rick Owens to design the stage as well as his outfits for SNL. On stage, Scott was decked out in full Rick Owens leather jumpsuit and matching gloves for “FE!N” and a pair of graphic track shorts, a blazer, zip-up hoodie and tech gloves for “MY EYES.” VMagazine confirmed that the stage design came from “the minds of Owens and Michèle Lamy through Owenscorp.”
Watch the full performances above and below. The songs heard were from his UTOPIA album which released last summer. Since the release, Travis Scott has embarked on a sold-out stadium tour all around North America.
