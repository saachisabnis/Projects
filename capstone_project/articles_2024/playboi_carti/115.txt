	Camila Cabello’s new album era is upon us.

	The pop star took to Instagram on Monday (May 6) to announce her fourth solo album, C,XOXO, alongside the cover art which features a close-up shot of the “Havana” singer with her recently dyed blonde hair, licking a blue lollipop and looking into the camera. In the caption, she reveals that the project arrives on June 28. See the post here. 

	The former Fifth Harmony member’s new project will be the follow-up to her April 2022 LP Familia, which reached No. 10 on the Billboard 200 upon its release. The record featured singles “Don’t Go Yet” and “Bam Bam” with Ed Sheeran, which peaked at Nos. 42 and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.

	Earlier this year, Cabello introduced her new album era with the Playboi Carti-assisted “I Luv It,” which samples Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade” and finds her interpolating Rihanna.

	“Certain things in our human realm do make me feel like I’m in outer space, and the very rare few times where I’ve had incredible chemistry with someone is one of them,” she said in a statement about the track’s inspiration. “Part of that cocktail is also the emotional drama between you and that person, and the chaos and butterflies and nerves and passion. It’s unsustainable and not peaceful and exhausting, but also, I LUV IT.”
