"It's Kanye!"
Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori were seen at a Donald Trump rally in Beverly Hills this weekend.
Trump is currently campaigning to be the next President of the United States. Last Saturday (August 17), fans of the Republican candidate showed their support by gathering at the Beverly Hills sign near Santa Monica Boulevard (per FOX 11).
In a video uploaded to TikTok, Ye and his wife Bianca Censori were filmed riding past the demonstration in a camouflage-print Tesla Cybertruck.
The person who was recording the video walked towards the passenger side of the vehicle, curious to see who was inside. When he saw it was the Chicago star, he yelled, “It’s Kanye!” before also exclaiming Trump’s infamous 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

West has been a longtime supporter of Trump. Back in 2016 ahead of the businessman’s first run as POTUS, the rapper was a vocal advocate for him. Ye was seen wearing the red MAGA hat synonymous with Trump’s first election run and was often pictured with the president.
When Trump was elected, they had a meeting at the White House to talk about policing in Chicago, creating a better US manufacturing industry and releasing the notorious Gangster Disciples gang founder Larry Hoover.
The ‘All Falls Down’ rapper attempted to run for president in 2020. West later revealed he planned to run again in 2024,  and said he would have wanted Trump to be his running mate. However, in October last year, West’s personal attorney Bruce Marks told Rolling Stone that the rapper “is not a candidate for office in 2024”.
Ye briefly distanced himself from Trump last year after the former president allegedly insulted West’s former wife Kim Kardashian. But, he renewed his support back in February, saying, “Yeah, of course, it’s Trump all day”.

Recently, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign dropped ‘Vultures 2’ – the second instalment of their ‘Vultures’ collaborative album trilogy – five months later than originally planned. It was originally thought to top the Billboard 200 chart, but Taylor Swift‘s most recent album – ‘The Tortured Poet’s Department’ – blocked him from the top spot, ending his 19-year-long streak of having his album debut at Number One.
The duo put out ‘Vultures 1’ – which NME said was “far from one of his best efforts either” and “mired in misogyny” – back in February. It had features from Freddie Gibbs, YG, Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, West’s daughter North and more.
In other Donald Trump news, fans have reacted to the 45th president by suggesting Taylor Swift endorsed him in an A.I-created post.
