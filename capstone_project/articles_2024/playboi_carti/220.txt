Playboi Carti season appears to be on the horizon. After releasing his first song on streaming services since 2020 with “All Red” on Friday (Sept. 13), Carti has further opened up about Music while revealing Ye’s (formerly Kanye West) involvement.

	The Atlanta rapper took to his Instagram Story to shout out Ye, and said they have been in the lab working on his album together.

	“@Ye KANT WAIT 2 SHOW THE WORLD WHAT WE BEEN WORKIN ON WIT DIS ALBUM WE DA REAL 5L NO DOUBT,” he wrote in his caption over a photo of the “All Red” cover art. 

	










	Carti’s next IG Story showcased his DMs — one of which featured a message from Ye appearing to lend his cosign to his latest single. “Love this,” West replied. 

	It remains to be seen if that means West has collaborations on the album, production or is in more of an executive producer role. Carti also alluded to Mike Dean’s involvement behind the boards. “@therealmikedean WENT CRAZY AS USUAL GENIUS S–T,” he wrote in one Story.

	Ye and PBC have a rich collaborative history over the years. Carti made multiple appearances on Vultures and Vultures 2, including earning his first Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit with “Carnival.” West guested on Carti’s Whole Lotta Red cut “Go2DaMoon” in 2020.

	With the arrival of “All Red” and an official Music announcement, it’s finally looking like Carti’s first album in four years could be arriving soon.

	He posted vinyl covers for the project to his Instagram and directed fans to visit his website, where Carti’s webstore is selling digital albums along with merchandise bundles, but there’s no release date and it’s only promised to arrive before October 2025.

	As for Ye, he’s been busy this year releasing a pair of Vultures projects with Ty Dolla $ign, which are his first since he was condemned for his repeated hate speech. He’s now off to China for a solo concert slated for Haikou on Sept. 15.
