	Meanwhile, Billie Eilish’s “Wildflower” has been steadily climbing the chart and has now broken into the Top 20 for the first time, landing bang on No. 20. 

	Billie is no stranger to chart-topping success, having previously reached No. 2 with her 2019 smash hit “Bad Guy.” With “Wildflower” continuing to gain momentum, it could mean Billie may be heading for another chart milestone.

	In another impressive leap, Linkin Park’s “Heavy Is The Crown” skyrocketed 48 places this week to No. 18, marking the band’s 20th U.K. Top 40 single. It’s clear that even after years in the game and a new vocalist, their fanbase remains as dedicated as ever, proving their staying power in a constantly evolving music landscape.

	Addison Rae also continues to rise, as her song “Diet Pepsi” moved up 15 spots to No. 22. This marks her first time breaking into the U.K. Top 40, marking a major achievement for the emerging pop star.

	Rounding out the chart’s newcomers is London MC Nines, who enters the Top 40 at No. 39 with “Going Crazy,” following the release of his final album. His latest effort has garnered enough attention to secure his seventh U.K. Top 40 single.

	Additionally, Noah Kahan’s “Stick Season,” named the biggest song of the year so far in the U.K., has made a return to the Top 40, landing at No. 40. The track’s ability to rebound into the chart after slipping out showcases its enduring popularity and appeal across various audiences.
