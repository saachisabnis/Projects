Both Ye and Ty posted a promotional flyer on Instagram on Monday (February 5), confirming the location and date of the event. They also shared a graphic with the number “1,” indicating it’s specifically for Vultures Volume 1 — the first installment in the pair’s trilogy.
The United Center has a concert capacity of 23,500 and also serves as the home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks.
There’s no word yet on whether Vultures Volume 2 and Vultures Volume 3 will have their own events.
