Saturday Night Live has been keeping hip-hop fans pretty satisfied.
Just a week after Kanye West performed on the show’s season opener, Travis Scott hit the Studio 8H stage for his SNL debut. And, just as we all expected, the Houston rapper performed two standout cuts from ASTROWORLD, his third studio album that arrived in August.
Travis performed a medley of “Skeletons” and "Astrothunder" with the help of Kevin Parker and John Mayer.
He then returned to the stage for a performance of "Sicko Mode."
This weekend’s episode was hosted by Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean’s 8 star Awkwafina.
Fans can also catch Travis on the road this fall for his ASTROWORLD: Wish You Were Here Tour. The trek includes stops in Baltimore, NYC, Philadelphia, and Chicago.
The full list of tour dates are available on the rapper’s official website.
