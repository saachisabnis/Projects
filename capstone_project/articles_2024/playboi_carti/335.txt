Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori have received a public apology from Adin Ross for his prior comments.
In a Kick stream on Thursday (February 22), the popular personality apologized, noting he spoke out because he’d gotten an email that he hinted may have been from Bianca herself.

“I have to apologize. This message is straight to Ye’s wife Bianca, because I just got an email about it,” Ross said.
The issue stemmed from a prior stream where Ross – who is known to pay rappers for their appearance on his channel – said he had backing from the related businesses Kick and Stake to pay Kanye for an appearance. However, he phrased it in a way that many assumed meant that no brands are doing deals with West at all. But the streamer clarified that he meant that streaming platforms are reluctant to pay for appearances — from anyone.

“When I said that I had money for Ye to come on stream from Kick and Stake, I wasn’t saying, ‘Nobody is throwing money these days,’ as far as like, nobody is paying him. Obviously, he’s Ye, one of the biggest artists of all time. But I mean, streaming platforms. Nobody is throwing money to anyone these days. Except for Kick. That’s all I meant.”
He continued: “I would love to have Ye come on stream. The offer still stands. Kick said it. I spoke to them a week ago about it. And, I’m sorry. I’m sorry publicly, all right, Bianca? Mrs. West and Mr. West, I’m sorry. We would love to have you on Kick.”
Adin Ross’ tune with Kanye West and Bianca Censori is quite different than his recent exchange with YBN Nahmir.
Nahmir initially went off at Ross in a video, criticizing Playboi Carti’s bizarre appearance on his Kick show.

“Ain’t you the same n-gga that just paid $2 million for a n-gga to sit next to you,” Nahmir said in a post to his Instagram Stories, presumably in response to an offer from Ross. “Don’t mention me in no bullshit. I don’t give a fuck about no free promo, no dick holding s**t, because I’m not that type of a n-gga. I don’t care. 20 bands? What the fuck is that?”
He then offered to fight the controversial streamer for $100,000 after claiming Ross originally offered him $20,000 for a fight. Ross responded on camera, turning down the request and going off on the rapper.

“Nahmir, you’re not worth $100,000. You fell off, you suck at music,” Ross started. “You failed your music career. I’ve got no disrespect to show, but that. Nahmir, you’re nothing. You’re nobody and your career sucks. He wanted 100 bands to fight. You are nowhere near 100 bands. And again, Kick paid Carti two mil. Hey, at least I got two mil to pay. You’re broke, fuck you!”
Nahmir did not take kindly to Ross’ reply, and took to Instagram Live with a response of his own.

“Don’t at me in no fucking shit if you’re talking shit, because you gon’ get smacked in your fucking mouth for it. You can hire all the security that you want to. It’s not going to work like that. Don’t disrespect my name and act like, ‘No disrespect, no disrespect!’ Shut the fuck up, n-gga! How the fuck you talk shit then cop a plea in the same fuckin’ video?”
