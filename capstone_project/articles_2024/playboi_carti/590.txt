Playboi Carti will be returning to Adin Ross’ channel after making a brief appearance on his livestream over the weekend that ended soon after the rapper was handed a bag of money.
Taking to Twitter on Monday (February 5) with a photo of himself on FaceTime with Carti, the popular Kick streamer promised that all the questions people had would be answered soon.

“Stream soon. Part 2, the right way for the fans… all questions will be answered,” he wrote.
The 23-year-old claimed that he was paying Carti $2 million and a new Ferrari to appear on his stream just hours before the interview, though he later told 21 Savage that he “didn’t pay that” when questioned about the amount.
Soon after Carti’s cameo, 21 confronted Adin Ross on a phone call and asked: “$2 million, bro?!”
Though Ross denied that was the full amount that Carti was paid, that didn’t stop 21 from continuing with: “Why the fuck you ain’t pay me, bro? That’s crazy, bro. I ain’t gonna lie, bro, that’s fucked up, bro.”

When he continued to deny that Carti was paid for his appearance, the “No Heart” rapper countered: “I just seen you give him a bag of cash.”
The streamer then tried to convince 21 that they would make money together but the rapper wasn’t having it, commenting: “Bro, we gotta have a talk when I see you.”
The contentious exchange came shortly after 21 appeared on Adin Ross’ show last week to much online controversy after the two began gambling.

The Atlanta-based rapper allegedly tried to scam Ross for $120,000 over a high-stakes dice game after he was caught using what appeared to be marked cards. When Ross noticed that he had been scammed after inspecting the cards they played with, 21 Savage denied having any prior knowledge of the markings.
Ross addressed the chat after showing the rap star the marked cards, saying: “Listen, I’ma be honest, chat, they’re not his cards. I know he’s not gonna do that to me.”
Savage later paid Ross $250,000, but some fans think it was a publicity stunt as the rapper began selling cards and dice on his website shortly after.
