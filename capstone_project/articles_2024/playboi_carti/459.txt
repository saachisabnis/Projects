In clips from the event that began making the rounds online, both stars can be seen playing unreleased joints such as “Field Trip/Venom” featuring Playboi Carti, “Promotion” featuring Future, “Take Off Your Dress” and “Fighting Fires.”
The following day, the duo also revealed the album’s artwork. In it, Kanye can be seen standing in an outfit and setting identical to the Vultures 1 cover, this time by himself and holding a framed headshot of what appears to be the Ty’s brother Jabreal Muhammad aka Big TC.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign will hit Phoenix, AZ for a listening event at the Footprint Center on March 10, possibly to officially premiere the upcoming album. Tickets are available now at Ticketmaster.
