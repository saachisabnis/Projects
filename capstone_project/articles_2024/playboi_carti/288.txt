YBN Nahmir is preparing to share another skillset with the public, in addition to rapping (and boxing): cooking up some tasty meals.
The “Rubbin Off the Paint” rapper took to Instagram on Friday (July 12) to say that he’d created a separate IG page for his cooking endeavors, @chefboinahmir.

The announcement video showed him preparing a mean that included greens with ham hocks and what Nahmir, in a later video, called “fake gumbo.”
Check it out below.
In addition to the soul food meal seen above, Nahmir has shared an additional video that demonstrates his facility at making burgers, which he jokingly says in the clip are made of “body parts.”
Nahmir’s pivot to cooking comes just a few months after he attempted a different temporary career change, to fighter.

Earlier this year, the YBN co-founder took to social media to unveil an apparent contract, complete with signatures, attempting to bait streamer Adin Ross into a boxing match.
The call for a face-off follows allegations that the streaming star initially offered compensation to Nahmir for a fight, only to later withdraw from the match-up.

Nahmir initially lashed out at Ross in a video, where he criticized Playboi Carti‘s bizarre appearance on his Kick show.
“Ain’t you the same n-gga that just paid $2 million for a n-gga to sit next to you,” Nahmir said in a post to his Instagram Stories, presumably in response to an offer from Ross. “Don’t mention me in no bullshit. I don’t give a fuck about no free promo, no dick holding s**t, because I’m not that type of a n-gga.  I don’t care. 20 bands? What the fuck is that?”

He then offered to fight the controversial streamer for $100,000 after claiming Ross originally proposed $20,000 to duke it out. Ross responded on camera, turning down the request and going off on the rapper.
“Nahmir, you’re not worth $100,000. You fell off, you suck at music,” Ross started. “You failed your music career. I’ve got no disrespect to show, but that. Nahmir, you’re nothing. You’re nobody and your career sucks. He wanted 100 bands to fight. You are nowhere near 100 bands. And again, Kick paid Carti $2 mill. Hey, at least I got $2 mill to pay. You’re broke, fuck you!”
