The Drake curse continues. 
Jake Paul defeated boxing legend Mike Tyson by unanimous decision on Friday (Nov. 15), delivering another controversial chapter in his career. Given the 30-year age gap and Tyson’s struggles in the ring in his later years, the result wasn’t entirely surprising. Paul’s victory came with a bitter twist for Drizzy, whose hefty $355,000 wager on Tyson went wrong.

Drake shared his bet on Instagram, posting a screenshot of the million-dollar gamble placed through Stake. “I’m late, but I’m here [with] money on the line for today and [tomorrow],” he wrote. If Tyson had triumphed, the payout would have exceeded $1 million. Instead, the rapper faced another betting loss, adding to a streak of ill-fated wagers involving Paul.
Paul’s measured performance in the fight sparked mixed reactions. During the post-fight press conference, he admitted he was holding back against Tyson. “I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want to hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” he explained. “It’s tough when the other guy is just surviving in the ring. I couldn’t get him to engage or make it more exciting.” Despite his dominant showing, Paul’s remarks underscored the challenges of balancing showmanship with respect for the sport’s legacy.
For Drake, betting against Paul has become an expensive habit. In August 2023, he staked $250,000 on Nate Diaz defeating Paul, only to see the YouTuber-turned-boxer prevail. Earlier in the year, the Canadian superstar placed a $400,000 bet on Paul defeating Tommy Fury. That wager also crumbled when Fury secured a split-decision victory.
On the music front, Drake has been equally busy, dropping a trio of tracks in August, including “No Face” with Playboi Carti, “SOD,” and “Circadian Rhythm.” The release marked his second three-song pack of the year and arrived amid ongoing buzz surrounding his feud with Kendrick Lamar.
While Drake’s luck at the betting table may falter, his musical output remains as prolific as ever. Meanwhile, Paul continues to blur the lines between spectacle and sport, carving out a career that keeps fans and critics talking.
