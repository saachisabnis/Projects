TikTok has been turning rising talents and relative unknowns in the music world into superstars—if only momentarily—for years now. Record labels regularly hunt the social media app for what may be the next hot song or act, but that’s not the platform’s only role in launching successful tunes.
Occasionally, users on TikTok will turn a years-old track—usually one that has been largely forgotten—into a hit. TikTokers often skew younger, and there have been many instances when they’ve collectively discovered a cut and used it in thousands upon thousands of videos, bringing the title back to prominence.
That’s exactly what’s happened this week with two of the biggest names in the music industry. Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé debut their only duet on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week, well over a decade after it was first released.
The pair of superstars launch their collaboration “Until the End of Time” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50, which ranks the most-used and most-heard tracks on TikTok each frame. The single starts its time on the list at No. 39, narrowly becoming a top 40 hit once again.
Timberlake and Queen Bey’s tune ranks as one of 15 debuts on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. Only three songs launch lower, but the two Grammy champions do manage to beat names like Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, and NLE Choppa.
“Until the End of Time” marks Timberlake’s second hit on the TikTok-only chart. Beyoncé snags her sixth career placement on the tally, and this new win marks her first collaboration on the ranking.
The two musicians released “Until the End of Time” in 2007 as the final single from Timberlake’s blockbuster album FutureSex/LoveSounds. The track was originally a solo production, but when it was chosen for promotion, Bey jumped on board and turned it into a must-hear event.
“Until the End of Time” climbed to No. 17 on the Hot 100, earning both stars another top 20 win. It was also a smash across a variety of radio formats, including dance, R&B, and pop. While it was a major occasion when it dropped, the song has not remained a favorite for many fans of either Timberlake or Beyoncé—but now it seems to have found a new fan base.
