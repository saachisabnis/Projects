Playboi Carti continues to drop music on social media instead of streaming services.

	On Friday (Nov. 22), the Atlanta rapper released “Play This” on his @opium_00pium Instagram account to follow up his recent ComplexCon performance in Las Vegas. The strategy is an interesting one, as he’s dropped a bunch of songs this year, but most only live on either social media or YouTube. We asked producer Cardo — a frequent collaborator of his — about said strategy and he thinks it’s Carti maybe testing the waters being that he’s always experimenting with new sounds and flows.

	Produced by Roark Bailey and V-Ron, the song is a nice little number that sounds like those loosies he used to post on Soundcloud. He’s rapping about making women go crazy, doing various narcotics, and opps. You know? The usual, but in a way only someone like Carti can, so it’s definitely interesting and a good warm-up for his upcoming and highly anticipated album I AM MUSIC.
