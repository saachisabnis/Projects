Playboi Carti has carved out a unique place in the rap scene, thanks to his distinct style and mysterious persona. Although he doesn’t often top the charts, his fanbase is intensely dedicated, reminiscent of Frank Ocean’s listeners. This fervent following brings both admiration and challenges, including issues like having his home address leaked online.
In a recent Billboard profile, Carti revealed the darker side of his fame. The rapper disclosed that the release of his album Whole Lotta Red was marred by unwanted attention from fans. As anticipation for the album mounted, some fans began to stalk Carti and his family, even sending flowers to his mother’s house. The situation escalated when his home address was leaked online, forcing him to move.
Despite the invasions of privacy, Carti expressed gratitude towards his fans. “I’m very blessed,” he stated, acknowledging the frustration of having his personal life exposed. “But it is frustrating because [that’s where] we have to lay our heads.”
The obsessive fan behavior stems partly from the long wait for new music. Carti has been working on his third studio album for four years, and there is no official release date in sight. This meticulous approach has drawn support from his team. Erin Larsen, manager of Carti’s Opium label, defended the artist’s slow process. “He’s giving people his absolute best,” Larsen noted. “You don’t want to see the Mona Lisa in an art museum before it is a finished piece of work.”
While the Billboard article indicates that Carti’s new album may be approaching, he remains committed to maintaining the mystery and quality of his work. Fans will have to wait until Carti is ready to share it, no matter how long it takes.
