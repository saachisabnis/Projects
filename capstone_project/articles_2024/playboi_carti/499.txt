Iggy Azalea has found a new way to score points on her ex-boyfriend Playboi Carti: by comparing outfits.
The Australian rapper took to Instagram on Saturday (February 10) to show off a black lingerie, which she captioned: “i love you…”
One user hopped in the comments section of the video to poke fun at the father of her child, who was recently photographed wearing a one-piece mesh top that becomes a thong when buttoned at the bottom.

“Yo BD out here in the same outfit,” the person wrote, referring to the Die Lit rapper.
The 33-year-old subsequently responded: “Well, who wore it better?”
Check out the exchange below:
Carti was spotted in his eye-catching outfit earlier this month as he was hitting the studio with Kanye West.
The pair were also spotted shooting a video the day before, with the Yeezy boss being photographed wearing two creepy masks at once, both inspired by classic horror films.

The Chicago native, who was in a car with wife Bianca Censori, was wearing a Michael Myers rubber mask with a Jason Vorhees-style hockey mask over it. Carti and actor/model Luka Sabbat were also in the car.
The Atlanta rapper is featured on Ye’s new joint album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1, which was released in early February — he appears on the song “Fuk Sumn” alongside Travis Scott.

For her part, Azalea has long been critical of Carti for his parenting. Late last year, she took shots at him after he appeared in a mini-documentary with their son, Onyx. The short film, Dear O, contains home video footage of the rapper looking every bit the doting father to his three-year-old son.
In a sarcastic message posted on Twitter the day after the project’s release, she took issue with the way the footage portrayed Carti, writing: “Its cool how you can fit damn near every visit into just one video. Talented!”
