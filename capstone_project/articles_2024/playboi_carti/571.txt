Gunna doesn’t appear to have taken kindly to Future crashing his album release party.
The “March Madness” hitmaker announced on Wednesday (May 8) that he’s dropping a new mixtape this Friday (May 10) and took a swipe at an unnamed rival in the process, writing on X: “Fuck yo album Shit ain’t slappin like my MIXTAPE.”

Gunna, whose new album One of Wun was already scheduled to drop on May 10, seemingly interpreted it as a shot in his direction and hit back with a tweet of his own.
“Turn this shit bac up Notch……!” he wrote, before adding: “Fuc What These boys talkin bout.”
Turn this shit bac up Notch……!

Future previously appeared to throw shade at Gunna earlier this year, presumably due to his relationship with Young Thug who Gunna has been accused of snitching on.
Back in March, Pluto’s X page posted a link to Gunna’s music video for “Prada Dem” featuring Offset, before deleting it hours later.

The Freebandz boss then posted a snippet of “Type Shit,” his collaboration with Travis Scott and Playboi Carti from his and Metro Boomin‘s We Don’t Trust You album, which includes the lyrics: “I don’t hang with rats, that’s some new type shit/ Get a n-gga whacked on the news type shit.”
Both moves were seen as digs at Gunna, who controversially accepted a plea deal in the ongoing YSL RICO case, which Thug is still on trial for.

21 Savage, Lil Baby and Lil Durk are among the other rappers who have also called out Gunna, subliminally or otherwise, for pleading his way out of the case.
In an interview with XXL last month, however, the “Drip Too Hard” rapper addressed the criticism he’s faced from some of his rap peers and claimed things aren’t as tense as fans are led to believe.

“None of those rappers, they’re not on the case. They don’t know legally what’s going on,” he said. “I talked to like, maybe like, two or three of those guys. I talked to them on the phone.”
While he didn’t reveal the nature of the conversations, he did say everything was done “peacefully.”
