	“Carnival” remains the chart’s top song, becoming the first to reign for more than one week since Flo Milli’s “Never Lose Me” ruled for four frames between Jan. 20 and Feb. 10.

	The song’s usage continues to largely revolve around its opening choir-led refrain and is used in a variety of ways, from lip-synching (usually in front of a mirror, known as the Carnival Mirror Trend) to soundtracking sports clips, gaming content, a dance trend and more.

	“Carnival,” as previously reported, rises 4% in official U.S. streams to 33.7 million, assisting its ascension to No. 1 on the multimetric Hot 100.

	The success of “Carnival” comes despite Ye’s various controversies, including recent and continued hate speech and antisemitic remarks that have caused some listeners to shy away from his material past and present.

	The entire top five of the TikTok Billboard Top 50 remains both intact and in the same order, with Bobby Caldwell’s “What You Won’t Do for Love,” Djo’s “End of Beginning,” Kinfolk Thugs, GC Eternal and Tyme Bomb’s “Back It Up and Dump It (Dump Truck)” and Cat Janice’s “Dance You Outta My Head” rounding out the top five.

	The rest of the top 10, however, is either made up of debuts or songs reaching the top 10 for the first time. They’re paced by Kaytoven’s “MONEY! (Money Money, Green Green),” which starts at No. 6. Released Feb. 24, the tune, which also sports slowed-down and sped-up versions on streaming services, had been teased on TikTok for weeks prior to its official release, sparking a strong premiere.

	










	“MONEY!” has benefited from a variety of uploads using the sound so far, including some lip-synching to the “money’s all I need” chorus to explain why they care about their grades or work, while others soundtrack the “ew, look at that trio” challenge.”

AP$ENT’s “Can I Come With You” follows at No. 7. The Russian-language song (it translates to “Можно я с тобой”), originally released in 2022, has seen some of its biggest success in cat-related content.

Bryson Tiller’s “Whatever She Wants” starts at No. 8, while DeJ Loaf’s “No Fear” rises 16-9 and Cardi B’s “Like What (Freestyle)” rounds out the top 10. Tiller’s tune began being teased on TikTok in January and has seen a steady ascent since, concurrent with its move into the top 20 of the Hot 100, jumping 22-19 on the latest ranking. Its usage on the platform is mostly via lip synch and dance content.

	“Like What” reaches the ranking as the song debuts at No. 38 on the Hot 100 following its March 1 premiere. Cardi herself got in on the action with one of the top-performing clips using the song so far, racking up over 1.7 million likes as of March 12.
