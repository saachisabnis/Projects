Kid Cudi had a Q&A session with fans on the heels of announcing his Insano tour that coincides with the release of his new album.
While speaking with fans, he reacted to one who asked, "You and Gambino gotta work on something whether it's TV, movies, or music we'd love to see/hear it! Your guys' song 'Warlords' needs an official release." The fan was referring to Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, to which Cudi responded, "I'm cool." 
Kid Cudi also responded to a fan asking him about the possible release of his collaboration with Playboi Carti, "Mr. Solo Dolo Part IV," which he called "weak" last year. Cudi made it clear that it's not coming out anytime soon, writing, "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO STOP ASKIN NO NO NO NO NO STOP ASKIN NO NO NO NO." You can read more above.
