Lil Nas X and Camila Cabello 
Camila Cabello has been rolling out a new sound in anticipation of her upcoming fourth album C, XOXO. Last month, she released the Playboi Carti collab “I Luv It” as the lead single from the project. Now, with a little over a month to go until the album’s release, Cabello is giving another taste of the LP with the Lil Nas X collab “He Knows.”
Like “I Luv It,” “He Knows” came to life with the help of Spanish producer El Guincho, who’s best known for his work with Rosalía. The song is certainly a lyrical departure from Cabello’s Fifth Harmony days as the upcoming album signals a more mature shift for the Cuban American singer.
“I think he knows / When I play with him like that / When I say it to him like that / Have my way with him like that,” she sings on the track. “I think he knows / When I play with him like that / When I say it to him like that / That he's comin' right back.”
Lil Nas X’s lyrics are similarly NSFW. “He drippin' down on my bustier like ice cream while Ashanti playin' in the AMG / Let it rain on me / He f**kin' up my headboard, so I'm on my knees like, ‘Dear Lord, please pray for me’ / Save the grace for me,” the Grammy winner croons.
When it comes to the album’s more adult-geared direction, Cabello said in a recent interview with The Forty-Five that it’s a move that’s true to her and comes with a purpose behind it.
“I feel like it’s like my way of, I don’t know, being of service to the world,” the Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree said. “My favorite artists—especially my favorite female artists—make me feel strong and empowered, and it feels cool that I feel like I’ve taken inspiration from that. And, hopefully, I can do that for people with this album, because that’s definitely very much the goal.”
C, XOXO is set for release on June 28.
