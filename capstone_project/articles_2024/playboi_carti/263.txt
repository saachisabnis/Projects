Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign’s album ‘Vultures’ found rapper Rich The Kid appearing on the album. Rich’s presence was heard on the track “Carnival,” along with Playboi Carti, and the track is currently number on Apple Music’s Top 100 USA chart. The “New Freezer” rapper was seemingly celebrating collaborating with the two artists on the project when Rap Radar’s Elliott Wilson offered what appeared to be less-than-flattering commentary. 
Via X, Wilson spoke on the former QC rapper, saying, “Rich The Kid is the luckiest n**** on the planet.” Rich The Kid did not take the comment well, going directly at Wilson for speaking on him. “How the f*** I’m lucky? N****s made that song from scratch.. hating is not cool bro,” said Rich. Take a look at the exchange above.
