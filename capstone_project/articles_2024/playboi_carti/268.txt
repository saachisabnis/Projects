DJ Akademiks recently commented on a controversial outfit worn by rapper Playboi Carti. According to Akademiks, Carti wore a limited-edition bodysuit with a thong, which provoked quite a reaction on social media. However, Akademiks defended Carti’s fashion choice by suggesting that people should live their truth and wear whatever they want. In response to the rapper’s unconventional choice of attire, Vlad called Carti 'the biggest worst rapper' in the world, questioning the artistry in his music. However, DJ Akademiks disagreed, stating that Carti is known for creating trending music and cited his influence on other rappers, defining him as a 'trendsetter.' He also pointed out that Carti's unique style has seen him evolve past mumble rap, and praised him for his daring approach to both music and fashion.
