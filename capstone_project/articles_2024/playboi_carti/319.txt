Rich the Kid‚Äôs latest album Life‚Äôs a Gamble is here.
Executive produced by Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign, the 17-track offering boasts an A-list roster of features, including Ye and Ty themselves, as well as Peso Pluma, Offset, French Montana, Chief Keef, BIA, and Quavo, among others.
Life‚Äôs a Gamble follows the success of Ye and Ty‚Äôs Vultures album cut ‚ÄúCarnival,‚Äù which features Rich and Playboi Carti. The song became Rich the Kid‚Äôs first No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Life‚Äôs a Gamble marks Rich‚Äôs first solo album since 2020‚Äôs Boss Man, which included features from Lil Baby, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, Lil Tjay, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and more.
Yeezy recently made headlines for revealing his plans to retire. Earlier this month, he told Rich he‚Äôs quitting music, explaining he doesn't know what else to do with his career.
"I am retiring from professional music. Not sure what else to do," he texted Rich.
In response, Rich said, "Retire? Why? How? The ppl NEED you. The music you & Ty & we have made was the BIGGEST STAMP in culture to this date. In 2024. Drop Ye about mine & V2 and we do it all over again, the kids need you, big bra, fasho. Maybe some time to chill but retiring ain't it."
Almost immediately after, Rich quote-tweeted news of the retirement texts and wrote, "ACTUALLY WE DROPPING FRIDAY üòÇ 7/19."
And lo and behold, Ye ended up on the album not once but twice. Stream Life's a Gamble here.
