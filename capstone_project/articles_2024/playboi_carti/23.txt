Metro Boomin’ and Live Nation announced on Friday (July 19) that a special event, “Metro & Friends,” will be held on July 29 in his hometown of St. Louis. 
At The Pageant, the concert will be a prelude to Metro Boomin’s joint tour with Future, titled “We Trust You,” which supports their two joint albums, We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You. Released in March and April, the albums feature The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross, Ty Dolla $ign, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, and more. The joint projects spawned the chart-topper and Drake diss song “Like That,” featuring Kendrick Lamar.
“Metro & Friends” lineup has not been revealed yet; however, the producer shared that the hometown show will showcase St. Louis hip-hop. The city has a lengthy history of producing hip-hop superstars, including Nelly, Chingy, J-Kwon, the late Huey, and Sexyy Red. 
Metro Boomin’ and Future hit London for the Wireless Festival last week and performed their hit songs for 50,000. We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You debuted at the top of the Billboard charts. After the joint albums, Future announced an upcoming mixtape, Yo Album Ain’t Slapping. 
Metro Boomin’s hometown show and upcoming tour follow the Grammy-nominated star living out his wrestling dreams in the new commercial for WWE’s upcoming event, “Bad Blood.” Last week, Metro and WWE Undisputed champion Cody Rhodes released a promo for the upcoming event that showed them about to enter chaos.
The “We Trust You” tour will begin in Kansas City, Missouri, on Tuesday, July 30. The full tour dates list is here. We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You are available now on all streaming platforms. 
Live Nation will begin selling tickets for the “Metro & Friends” hometown show on Monday, July 22.
