Travis Scott was joined by a surprise guest Owen Wilson during his headlining set at Rolling Loud Miami 2024.

	On Saturday (Dec. 14), the Houston rap star invited the Loki actor to the stage to perform “FE!N” from Scott’s 2023 album Utopia.

Fan-captured footage from the festival, held at Miami Gardens’ Hard Rock Stadium, shows Wilson enthusiastically helping Scott deliver the high-energy track, which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 2023.

	“I’m feigning for more,” Owen shouted to the crowd, wearing a white hoodie, after briefly embracing Scott. The 56-year-old actor then jumped up and down to hype the audience as “FE!N” kicked off.

	The surprise appearance comes amid news that Wilson is set to star in Rolling Loud, a film inspired by the annual music festival. The R-rated comedy, which also features comedian Matt Rife, follows an overprotective father (played by Wilson) who attends the festival with his 13-year-old son, a reckless co-worker (Rife) and a festival volunteer, according to Deadline. The film is written and directed by Jeremy Garelick.

	It remains unclear if footage of Wilson’s onstage moment with Scott at Rolling Loud Miami will appear in the film.

	










	The cameo added to the excitement surrounding Rolling Loud’s 10th anniversary celebration this year. Along with Scott, the 2024 Miami lineup featured headliners Future and Playboi Carti. Other performers included Metro Boomin, Lil Yachty, Don Toliver, Kodak Black, Sexyy Red, Lil Baby, Bryson Tiller, Shaboozey and Rich The Kid.

	Next up, Scott is set to return to Coachella in 2025. In late November, the hip-hop superstar teased that he’ll be giving the festival grounds in Indio, Calif., a Cactus Jack makeover. He also hinted at a “new chapter,” where he’ll debut music from his upcoming era for fans at the Empire Polo Club.
