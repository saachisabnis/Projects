The unlikely pair were spotted attending a Grammys party together earlier this year, and it appeared that their linking up had to do with the forthcoming song.
Back in May, the two shared a snippet of the then-unnamed song in a joint Instagram post, along with a photo of them on a front porch with the caption: “If u come from where u come then u were born….Tough!”
Lana Del Rey is no stranger to working with rappers. Back in 2017, she recruited The Weeknd for “Lust for Life,” which featured on her album of the same name. On that same album, she worked with Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky on “Summer Bummer.”
She also collaborated with The Weeknd on two of his songs, “Stargirl Interlude” from his 2016 album Starboy and “Prisoner” from his 2015 LP Beauty Behind the Madness.

I’m living my life,” she said in response to a question of how she felt about the diss tracks. “Working, paying my bills, taking time for myself and that’s all that matters. Whatever else is going on, I ain’t got nothing to do with it. I’m living a peaceful life. That’s all I want.”
She added: “I just don’t want any parts, I just want peace and happiness. I want to work and thrive.”
