A fun fact about the lyrics on Rihanna‘s “SOS” was shared in a recent interview with the songwriter, Evan “Kidd” Bogart. Speaking to the Behind the Wall podcast, he shares it was his first time ever creating a pop song. “I was going off of instinct. If you look at the verses, they’re crafted with a lot of clever word play and internal rhyme schemes — like a rapper would,” he said. “The whole second verse of that song is ’80s song titles strung together as sentences because I thought it would be clever.”
