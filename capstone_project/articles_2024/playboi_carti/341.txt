The one-night-only concert also saw the tracks livestreamed on YouTube
The Weeknd debuted several new songs at his one-off São Paulo show.
The one-off gig took place last night (September 7) and follows on from the singer – real name Abel Tesfaye – embarking on his ‘After Hours Til Dawn Tour’ over the last two years.
During the show, which the singer previously announced would be livestreamed exclusively on his YouTube channel, so “everyone around the world can be a part of this special night”, he premiered a handful of new songs thought to be from his new album, ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow’.
Among them was an appropriately named new track reportedly called ‘São Paulo’, which saw him joined by Brazilian artist Anitta.
Although the official titles of the latest tracks weren’t all revealed, fans have used the lyrics to piece them together – with the presumed new titles including ‘Dancing in the Flames’ and ‘Run Away’. You can check out fan-shot footage and the setlist below:

Earlier this week, The Weeknd unveiled details of his upcoming album and suggested that the upcoming third chapter to his ongoing ‘After Hours’ and ‘Dawn FM’ was on the way in a series of recent social media posts.
Another teaser arrived online and seemed to further confirm that new music would be arriving soon and, in a new post shared on Wednesday (September 4), the musician finally shared a trailer for his new album and revealed its name.
“Today has felt like an endless spin,” it read. “I keep distorting the truth, immune to the dizziness, numb to the nausea. What lies beneath — screams in silence.
“I look in the mirror and feel both old and new stuck in limbo and unable to move. I still haven’t faced myself…,” another part reads.
It continued: “The very thing that once made me invincible failed me on the world stage. A new trauma surfaced. When today ends, I’ll discover who I am. HURRY UP TOMORROW.”
The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.
