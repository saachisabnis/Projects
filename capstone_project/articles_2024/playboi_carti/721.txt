Kanye West is dissing Drake, Adidas, Hailey Bieber and more while celebrating "Carnival" reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
On Monday night (March 11), Kanye West shared a video on his new Instagram account in celebration of his Vultures 1 single "Carnival" featuring Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid topping the chart. In doing so, Ye made sure to call out Drake, Hailey Bieber, the Three Stripes brand and more. The visual is a music video for their No. 1 song. You can watch the video in full below.
In a since-deleted caption on Instagram, Ye went in. "F**k Adidas and everybody who works there," he wrote in the lengthy missive. "F**k everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber."
Also on Ye's F-you list were U.K. publication Daily Mail, Christians who watched his custody battle and Drake. "And it's f**k Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures [rollout]," he added. This refers to Drake welcoming Lil Durk on the remaining dates for the It's All a Blur Tour - Big As the What?.
Ye also posted a video on his Instagram page taking further aim at Adidas.
"Yo, Adidas, y’all tried to destroy me and now we got the No. 1 song in the world," Ye says in the video below. "When I was there, y'all was stealing my ideas and putting them in your company. Then, you dismantled my creative team. Then, you started making fake colorways. Then, you paid off my lawyers while I was with you."
