Gunna appears to have joined Drake‘s army of enemies by taking shots at the 6 God on his new album One of Wun.
Released on Friday (May 10), the project finds the YSL rapper, who has no shortage of adversaries in the rap game himself, seemingly aiming thinly-veiled jabs at Drizzy on more than one occasion.

On the track “Still Prevail,” Gunna raps: “I clear all the tabs/ They pay for their abs.”
The line echoes claims made by Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross in recent weeks that Drake underwent surgery to give himself a more defined stomach.

“You had that surgery, that six-pack gone. That’s why you wearin’ that funny shit at your show. You can’t hide it, n-gga,” Rozay sneered at the end of his diss song “Champagne Moments,” while K. Dot rapped on “Euphoria”: “Let your core audience stomach that, then tell ’em where you get your abs from.”
Gunna also appears to reference the longstanding ghostwriting allegations surrounding Drake on “Collage,” rapping: “Thank God I didn’t need a writer/ I work but they think they entitled.”

This subject has also been used as ammo against the Toronto native by Rozay and Kendrick, with the latter saying on “Euphoria”: “Ain’t 20 v. 1, it’s 1 v. 20 if I gotta smack n-ggas that write with you.”
One of Wun can be streamed in full below.
Many fans were expecting Gunna to have smoke for Future on the album after the Freebandz boss appeared to throw shade at him on social media.
Earlier this week, Pluto hinted at releasing a new mixtape on May 10, the same day One of Wun was scheduled to arrive, and wrote: “Fuck yo album Shit ain’t slappin like my MIXTAPE.”

Seemingly interpreting the tweet as a shot in his direction, Gunna wrote on his own X (formerly Twitter) account: “Turn this shit bac up Notch……! Fuc What These boys talkin bout.”
Future’s post, it turns out, was actually a reference to his new collaboration with Tee Grizzley, “Swear to God,” which includes the aforementioned line.

The “March Madness” rapper previously appeared to shade Gunna earlier this year, presumably due to his relationship with Young Thug who Gunna has been accused of snitching on.
Back in March, Future’s X page posted a link to Gunna’s music video for “Prada Dem” featuring Offset, before deleting it hours later.

He then posted a snippet of “Type Shit,” his collaboration with Travis Scott and Playboi Carti from his and Metro Boomin‘s We Don’t Trust You album, which includes the lyrics: “I don’t hang with rats, that’s some new type shit/ Get a n-gga whacked on the news type shit.”
Gunna has vehemently denied snitching as part of his plea deal in the ongoing YSL RICO case that secured his release from jail.
