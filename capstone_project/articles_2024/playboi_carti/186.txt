Travis Scott releases six versions of his Days Before Rodeo mixtape then mysteriously takes them down.
On Thursday (Aug. 29), La Flame surprised fans by dropping six deluxe editions of his Days Before Rodeo tape, which was originally released in 2014 on his website. The mixtape was only added to streaming platforms last week for its 10-year anniversary. The new versions include the Digital Deluxe Album Vault 1, Digital Deluxe Album Vault 2, Digital Deluxe Album Vault 3, Standard Edition + Live From Atlanta and the Chopped and Screwed Edition. The new releases feature additional songs with guest appearances from Young Thug, Quavo and Playboi Carti.
However, sometime on Thursday, the projects were removed for Travis' website. Now there are only two vinyl versions of the tape for sale. The reason for the removal is unclear.
XXL has reached out to Travis Scott's team for comment.
Travis Scott seems hellbent on capturing the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart with the rerelease of his classic mixtape. However, he has some stiff competition. Earlier this week, it was announced he was on pace to move 220,000 equivalent album units and debut at No. 2 on the chart. That would place him behind singer Sabrina Carpenter, who released her new album, Short n' Sweet, last week and is projected to sell in the 300,000 range.
Carpenter seemed to address Travis' attempt on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday night.
"This one’s for nicki," she tweeted, which appears to be a reference to Travis' Astroworld album stopping Nicki Minaj's Queen LP from debuting No. 1 in 2018. At the time, Nicki lambasted Travis after coming in second and accused him of selling merch and bundle packages to boost his sales.
