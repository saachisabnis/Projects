Camila Cabello shocked fans earlier this year when she unveiled her blonde bombshell transformation, trading her signature brunette locks for a new platinum look. Now, she's sharing some insight into her decision to try something new — and revealing the musical inspiration behind the change.
The Fifth Harmony alum sat down with for a chat at L'Ecrin Plage during Canne Lions in France on Monday (June 17) where she spoke about her reasoning for trying something new with her appearance, saying that she drew inspiration from other artists who were known to change up their look throughout their career, per Page Six. 
"Changing my physical appearance like my blonde hair or fashion — whatever I do, I learned how exciting that is from people like Madonna or David Bowie," she said, adding, "Always keep it fresh for people."
The "Havana" singer noted that the sudden drastic transformation could be a shock to "day one fans" but hopes that anyone who had an issue with it would reconsider as long as Cabello is being true to herself.
"I trust that as long as I'm being me, they know me and love me for me," she said.
The "My Oh My" singer is gearing up to drop her fourth studio album C, XOXO, which will feature collaborations with artists like Playboi Carti, Lil Nas X and Drake. Last month, she shared how she got Drake, who she called the "GOAT," to appear on the album.
