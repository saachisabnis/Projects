	Countless celebrity faces have been spotted around Paris Fashion Week this fall, and even though Camila Cabello was in attendance, her face went unseen.

	At the Vetements runway show in the French capital on Friday (Sept. 27), the pop star sported a black balaclava that covered her entire head, minus cutouts for her eyes, mouth and glitzy earrings. She paired the daring accessory with a lacy bodysuit, black jacket and miniskirt.

	At one point, Cabello reunited with her former Fifth Harmony bandmate Normani to snap photos together near the catwalk, also joined by Ice Spice. J Balvin, Bella Thorne, Fedez and Tom Daley were also in attendance, while Travis Scott and Gigi Hadid both walked in the brand’s Spring-Summer 2025 showcase.

	Though the “Havana” singer certainly stood out with her Fashion Week look, it wasn’t entirely random. Cabello has been incorporating ski masks into the aesthetics of her latest album C,XOXO — which debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 in July — sporting a pink, bedazzled head-and-face covering in the LP’s trailer and the official visualizer for lead single “I Luv It” featuring Playboi Carti.

	Normani also dropped an album over the summer, sharing her long-awaited debut LP Dopamine in June. The projected charted at No. 91 on the Billboard 200.

	Shortly after Dopamine dropped, Cabello showed her fellow X Factor alum some love. “Putting out a project is vulnerable and hard and you are doing it beautifully ! Congratulations on your first album and many more to come !!!!!!!!” the “Bam Bam” artist commented on Instagram at the time, to which Normani replied: “@camila_cabello thank you so much for this 🖤 this seriously means a lot and so v proud of you. you’re next, let’s goooo.”
