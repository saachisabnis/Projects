Nick Cannon and Wild ‘N Out fans surprised the family of late rapper Rich Homie Quan on Thursday with a $25,000 donation during Wild ‘N Out‘s tour stop in Atlanta. Fans of the show raised $10,000, which Cannon matched. The State Farm Arena, where Thursday’s show took place, donated an additional $5,000.

	“A brother like Rich Homie Quan is somebody who is truly worth all of our tears because he put on for us,” Cannon said during the show. “Every time we had him on the show, every time he was a part of this tour he rocked. He went crazy.”

	Cannon added that Quan “was suppose to be here tonight”; he had previously appeared and performed in Season Six and Season 20 of Wild ‘N Out. Cannon and the Wild ‘N Out cast also celebrated Quan with performances of his tracks, including “Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh)” and “Type of Way.”

Fellow rappers Quavo, Playboi Carti, and comedian Lil Duval have shared tributes in honor of the rapper. Quan’s family also shared a tribute to the rapper they knew as a “beloved son, brother, father, and friend.”
