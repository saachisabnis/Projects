For the second consecutive year, RDCWorld streamed the opening night of Super Bowl Week at Media Day. This year, the popular online collective hosted players from both the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs to join the group on stage to play multiple rounds of Madden.
RDCWorld is helmed by comedian and visionary Mark Phillips.
The team also includes a host of other Black and Brown creatives that have taken viral skits about LeBron James and J. Cole to meeting the two cultural giants and hosting over 22,000 people at their Dream Con convention in Austin, Texas.
The world of RDC combines technology, culture and comedy to create alternate universes and in-depth cinema.
After streaming at Super Bowl LVIII, Phillips spoke to rolling out about the collective and the team effort it takes to bring the ideas to life.
What was streaming at the Super Bowl like?
Streaming at the Super Bowl is honestly one of the best experiences. It’s our second time doing it, and we lost a lot, but I’m just happy to play Madden with some NFL players.

Is there anybody you would pay millions to to stream?
Oh, you’re talking about how they did Adin? You’re talking about for like 10 minutes?
Man, there ain’t anybody. Man, what? The Silver Surfer. Somebody from off this planet because I’m not paying $2 million for a soul to walk in there, jig in the back, come up to the camera, say, “I love you” and then dip.
I would’ve given him $20. No offense to Carti, but I would have given you $20.
With Dream Con, your Black-owned and operated convention, what are you looking forward to this year and what are you proud of from its past years?
The vision this year is to give people the best experience we can give them.
Over the past few years, I’ve had a great time. We jumped from like six to 20,000 attendees.
We just want to thank y’all from the bottom of our hearts, for real. We’re so grateful for that.
What does each member of RDC do?
Phillips: I think Leland is the funniest one. He’s a comedian, actor and does a lot of the gaming stuff. He does some RDC Universe stuff … Dylan is another one of the funniest ones. He does the gaming and the tech work. … But shout out to Dylan, for real, man. We appreciate you. John runs Dream Con, so you need to thank him for everything that’s happening with Dream Con, too. Ben does the sound, business deals and he acts, as well. Everybody’s an actor by default, so let’s go ahead and say that. Desmond does our CGI, acting and some business deals. Affiong does all of our camera work and editing. I started RDC with him. Ipi does our business deals. He’s doing business right now, getting everybody’s numbers and locking them in. He’s African, so shout out to all the Africans in the world.
