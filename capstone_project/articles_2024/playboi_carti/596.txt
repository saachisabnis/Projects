Playboi Carti stirred up excitement again, but ultimately let his fans down. On Thursday evening, he built up anticipation for new music, even sharing a message days earlier where he promised a release on November 22. He highlighted an Instagram comment about the importance of taking time with art. However, when the time came, he didn't release anything. There were no new singles on streaming platforms or Instagram, and he didn’t inform fans of any plans to release music later that day. This left many fans disappointed.
Some fans tried to defend Carti, noting that he did share two snippets of music on November 21, one titled "Play This" and another untitled. While he may have felt this was enough, the fact remains that November 21 is not the same as November 22, making him seem untrustworthy by usual standards. After assuring fans something official was coming on Friday, they were left wanting an actual release.
Carti's earlier comments added to fans' frustrations. He had posted several messages saying he was far from finished and that his album would be amazing. He even boasted about being “locked in”, hinting at a big night ahead. Instead, it felt like more of the same disappointment, leading fans to express their anger on Twitter.
The fans have been waiting for a long time, and their patience is wearing thin. Some shared gifs and memes that poke fun at rappers who don’t keep their promises, while others spoke out directly about Carti's confusing release strategy. One fan expressed their frustration, saying, "Playboi Carti isn’t laid-back," while another criticized fellow fans for continually supporting him despite frequent letdowns. They suggested that if fans stopped idolizing him, he might finally deliver on his promises. Reactions from the community clearly show rising frustration.
