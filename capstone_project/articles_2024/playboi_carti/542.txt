All eyes may have been on New Orleans this week thanks to the debate surrounding Kendrick Lamar’s upcoming Super Bowl halftime show, but Detroit takes top billing in this week’s New Music Friday albums spotlight.
The Motor City’s most famous MC Eminem digs up The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) and releases an expanded “Mourner’s Edition” featuring three new songs. They include an Eric B. & Rakim-sampling collaboration with 2 Chainz and DJ Premier that will delight older heads, as well as a remix of “Fuel” featuring Shady Records spitters Westside Boogie and Grip on which Eminem takes more shots at Diddy.

Flying the flag for Detroit’s current generation, Babyface Ray continues his ascent with The Kid That Did which “delves into his rise to success and the relentless drive that got him there,” according to a press release. Helping him tell that story are features from BossMan Dlow, Fabolous, G Herbo, Veeze and more.
Collaborative chemistry is also a feature of this week’s list as there are new rapper-producer projects from Jay Worthy and MadeinTYO and Talib Kweli and J. Rawls, while R&B fans are blessed with new offerings from SoCal soul-slinger Terrace Martin, rising star Fousheé, veteran singer Jordin Sparks and Jhené Aiko, who turns back the clock with a 10th anniversary rerelease of her breakthrough debut Souled Out.
