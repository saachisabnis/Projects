Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” notches its 13th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week. The crossover hit now claims the third-longest stint atop the single’s chart this decade, behind only Morgan Wallen’s 16-week run with “Last Night” in 2023, and Harry Styles’ 15-week rule with “As It Was” in 2022. Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” jumps up four spots to No. 2, a new high for the single propelled by the release of its music video, which also marks Eilish’s highest charting song since 2020. The Weeknd and Playboi Carti’s new collaboration, “Timeless,” debuts at No. 3, coming in as the top streamed song of the week. Rounding out the Top 5 is Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Wallen, which drops two spots to No. 4, and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” falls two spots to No. 5. Carpenter again has three songs in the Top 10 for a sixth consecutive week, with “Taste” at No. 9 and “Please Please Please” at No. 10. (Billboard)
