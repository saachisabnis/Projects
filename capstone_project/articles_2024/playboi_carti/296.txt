New photos of Playboi Carti wearing what appears to be a thong bodysuit has fans reacting online.
On Tuesday (Feb. 6), new pictures of Playboi Carti began circulating online. In the photos, which can be seen below, the rapper is wearing a vest and camo pants. His face appears to have war paint on it. However, underneath the rapper's top layer of clothing is a sheer thong long-sleeve mesh shirt that looks like a thong bodysuit. The piece of clothing looks similar to one of the designs from the Rick Owens and Champion collaboration. It is not actually a thong Carti is wearing and only appears like one.
The photos of the artist have gone viral, with many people weighing in on Carti's eccentric choice of attire.
"Playboi Carti got the body suit on that snap at the bottom smh," one person on X, formerly known as Twitter, posted.
"I am officially retired as a playboi carti fan 2016-2024 it was a nice run," someone else posted.
"Just saw DRAKE d**k leaked and PLAYBOI CARTI wearing a THONG in a same day .. yeah this really the worst Tuesday of all time in my life," another post reads, referencing a recent NSFW Drake video leak.
Others were unfazed. "Y’all can NEVER make me hate Playboi Carti. Like fr," a diehard Vamp shared.
