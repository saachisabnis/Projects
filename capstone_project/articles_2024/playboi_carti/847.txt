Footage of Playboi Carti being arrested in September of 2022 for driving over 130 miles per hour has surfaced.
On Tuesday (Jan. 9), YouTube channel Raq Rarest uploaded nearly an hour's worth of bodycam footage from an incident on Sept. 21, 2022, in which Playboi Carti was pulled over for speeding. In the video, which can be seen below, the officer orders the rapper to turn off the car and stick his hands out the window. After approaching the rapper's car, the officer demands to know why Carti was driving over 130 miles per hour in a 55 mile-per-hour zone.
"I'm rushing because I had an emergency," Carti says.
"Bro, you were driving 133 miles per hour in a 55 mile-per-hour zone," the officer shoots back.
"It was an emergency," Carti replies. "I got stuff going on with my family. I live in Buckhead, I'm trying to get somewhere."
The officer is not trying to hear it and places Carti under arrest for speeding. After being put in the back of the police cruiser, the rapper reveals he was trying to get to the airport. The officer does not believe his story and drives Carti to jail.
XXL has reached out to Playboi Carti's attorney and the Fulton County Sheriff's Office for comment.
Playboi Carti was arrested three months after the speeding incident. In December of 2022, he was taken into custody for allegedly choking his then-pregnant girlfriend. The victim told police she and Carti got into an argument over the child's paternity. The fight turned violent and the rapper allegedly grabbed her by the throat and choked her. At the time, Carti's attorney released a statement saying his client was "falsely accused."
The new leaked arrest footage surfaces as Carti is preparing to release his new Music album.
