Camila Cabello was in London, England for an album signing event on July 1, but she was repping the United States through her wardrobe choices. The pop singer wore a Mowalola shirt dress bearing the Yankees logo with a pair of patent leather Timberland stilettos when she arrived at HMV on Oxford Street for the event. 
Cabello’s latest album “C,XOXO” was released on June 28, with singles including “I Luv It” with Playboi Carti and “He Knows” with Lil Nas X. 

 









To promote her fourth studio album, Cabello wore an oversized collared button down in a blue pinstriped pattern. The layered shirtdress included a short sleeve white shirt emblazoned with the navy logo of the New York Yankees on the front. Over her shoulders, the “Havana” singer draped a green patterned bomber jacket featuring graffiti designs, also from Mowalola. The front of the jacket bears the Yankees NY logo as well.

Cabello carried a unique black handbag which featured images of items you might find in a purse, like headphones, a lottery ticket, loose money, and an I Heart NY coin purse. Attached to the accessory was a Vaquera teddy bear keychain in camouflage tones. Meanwhile, her long hair was dyed light blonde and worn out, falling near her waist.

On her feet, Cabello wore patent leather Timberland stilettos designed in collaboration with Veneda Carter. In the classic Timberland shade of tan, the waterproof shoes included a sharp toe and a black heel. A tied shoelace hung like a tassel from the top of the boots. The heels boast Timberland’s PrimaLoft insulation, premium leather uppers and shock-absorbing anti-fatigue technology. 
The Veneda Carter Timberland boots were first released earlier this year in March. 
The same day she announced “C,XOXO,” Cabello attended the 2024 Met Gala wearing gold heeled sandals from Gianvito Rossi. When out with Lil Nas X later that month for Heart WeHo, the singer wore a pair of black and white leather cowboy boots with designs that appeared as though spray painted. Back in March, she continued to show off her unique taste in footwear when she wore belt chaps from Hodakova over pointed-toe shoes when she visited SiriusXM.
