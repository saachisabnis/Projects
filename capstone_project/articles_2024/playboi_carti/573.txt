Lana Del Rey 
Lana Del Rey has been hard at work since the turn of the decade. The acclaimed artist released back-to-back albums in 2021 followed by Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd last spring. Now, just a year after her last full-length, Del Rey is laying the groundwork for her tenth studio album Lasso.
For her new single “Tough,” Del Rey teamed up with hit-making rapper Quavo to give listeners what appears to be the first taste of Lasso. It marks her first collaboration with a rapper since her 2017 album Lust for Life where she joined forces with A$AP Rocky and Playboi Carti. Both Del Rey and Quavo are surprisingly at home in the country-trap song, and in the video for the track, they brought the story to life with an on-screen romance.
“Tough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boots / Like the blue-collar, red-dirt attitude / Like a .38 made out of brass / Tough like the stuff in your grandpa's glass,” the two sing together on the track. “Life's gonna do what it does / Sure as the good Lord's up above / I'm cut like a diamond shinin' in the rough / Tough.”
When speaking at the 2024 NMPA Songwriter Awards earlier this year about her next project, Del Rey noted that other artists who typically don’t dabble in country music have started to dabble in the genre.
“If you can’t already tell by our award winners and our performers, the music business is going country. We’re going country. It’s happening,” Del Rey said, per Billboard. “That’s why Jack [Antonoff] has followed me to Muscle Shoals, Nashville, [and] Mississippi over the last four years.”
Lasso is slated for release in September.
