Kanye West collaborator Digital Nas is not happy about how the credits have been listed for Ye and Ty Dolla $ign‘s hit single “Carnival.”
In a heated rant on social media, the producer began by posting a screenshot of an email from A&R Matt Geffen who informed Digital Nas that his contributions to the Vultures 1 track had not verified by fellow producers Traxster, 88-Keys and Morning Estrada.

Digital Nas then said: “I’ma give you context to how these vulture-ass n-ggas work. Fritz [Owens, engineer] text me, ‘Ye and Carti need you.’ I go there. ‘Nas, what do we need done to ‘Carnival’?’ I tell them n-ggas everything that needs to be done, told Ye to change his verse.
“‘Carnival’ gets nominated for a fucking Grammy, it goes number one. They’re doing the paperwork, this fucking guy Matt Geffen comes out of nowhere, tries to regulate shit.”

He continued: “I’m showing y’all this to let y’all know how many vultures are in this music industry […] These n-ggas are fighting over crumbs. ‘Carnival’ made $47,000 publishing.
“These n-ggas is old as fuck, don’t have no talent. But they use young n-ggas’ sound and then they try to say they did something on the record when they didn’t do shit! But the n-ggas who actually did shit on the record, they take them n-ggas off!

“When it’s small records like ‘Paperwork,’ ‘Oh yeah, leave Nas on that.’ But when it’s big records that went number one, ‘Nah, he ain’t do shit on that.’ Fuck all y’all n-ggas!”
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign have yet to respond to the producer’s complaint.

Digital Nas is no stranger to controversial statements having recently criticized Tyler, The Creator’s acclaimed new album Chromakopia.
After Tyler announced the project last month, Nas attempted to rain on the Odd Future founder’s parade by commenting on his Instagram post: “Omg here we go again the same album made all over again with these gay ass Tyler the Creator chords and weak ass Pharrell drums.”

Nas, who in addition to Kanye West has also worked with Playboi Carti and Lil Yachty, further trashed the album on his Instagram Stories, writing: “Not buying it. It’s time for sum new. Let me fucking in!”
The harsh comments did not go unnoticed by Tyler, who sent a private message to the Donda beatmaker (that was later shared online), sarcastically responding: “I FEEL YOU THIS TYLER GUY IS A FAGGOT BRO DONT BUY IT [zombie emoji].”
