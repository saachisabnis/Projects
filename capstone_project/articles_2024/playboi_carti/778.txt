Quentin Miller has been revealed as a songwriter on Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign‘s new album Vultures 1.
In an Instagram post from Saturday (February 10), the musician shared his contributions to the project while reflecting on the significance of working with Ye, especially with the album arriving on the 20th anniversary of The College Dropout.

“Exactly 20 years after the album that changed my life dropped …Who woulda known man,” Miller wrote. “Shoutout [The Game] for the intro to Ye. Shoutout [Tracey Mills] for sealing the deal. Shoutout to @kanyewest & @tydollasign.”
He then listed the songs he helped write, which were “Stars,” “Talking” featuring North West, “Fuk Sumn” featuring Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, and the Chris Brown-assisted “Beg Forgiveness.”
Quentin Miller’s involvement with Vultures 1 sparked plenty of reactions on social media, with one person writing: “Quentin Miller writing on Vultures is an incredible plot twist.”
Another wrote: “Quentin Miller got done dirty after that whole Drake–Meek Mill beef. So to see him finally getting some work and acknowledgment is super dope.”

Someone else echoed that sentiment, writing: “S/O to Quentin Miller, the industry did that man wrong. I’m glad Ye included him on this new album.”
Miller rose to prominence almost a decade ago when he was outed by Meek Mill as Drake’s alleged ghostwriter, with the Philadelphia rapper accusing him of penning Drizzy’s verse on their “R.I.C.O.” collaboration.

It was later revealed that Miller contributed to several songs on Drake’s 2015 mixtape If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, with his alleged reference track for ““10 Bands” being played on Hot 97 by Funk Flex.
While reflecting on the drama last year, Quentin Miller revealed he was never properly compensated for his work on Drake’s aforementioned project.

“I never got a single publishing check off any songs,” he said. “I had to feed my family off getting paid under the table in that situation, because Tricky and them wouldn’t let me go. I didn’t get out that deal ’til 2019, 2020; I signed [it in] 2011. I had to let go of a lot of shit just to get out.
“Even while I was in it, I never got a publishing check or nothing. I was just grinding, bro. I was grinding it out just hoping that one day that one song or working with that one artist is gonna change something — and that was the Drake thing! But it just didn’t change anything.”

That isn’t not the only tough blow Miller has been dealt in the music game. Back in 2022, A$AP Rocky unknowingly rained on the songwriter’s parade when he advised Kanye West to remove one of his contributions to his verse on Cardi B’s “Hot Shit.”
“[The] Game brings me to the room Kanye’s working on the song he has with Cardi B and Lil Durk,” he explained on the New Rory & MAL podcast. “I contribute a line, I say a line.

“He’s like, ‘Oh, that’s hard!’ Records it. Pusha [T] is hyping me up — that’s my man — he comes over and he’s like, ‘Yo, that shit’s hard!’ Everybody’s loving it.”
He continued: “30 minutes later, Rocky walks into the room. He’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s just this one line that I want you to change.’ And he picks my line! He didn’t know. So then Kanye’s like, ‘But I really like that line.’

“10 minutes go by and Rocky’s like, ‘Nah, man. You gotta change that line!’ And I don’t have enough clout! I’m sitting there like [swallowing defeat].”
