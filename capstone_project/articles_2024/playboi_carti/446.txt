	The set launches with 251,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending March 28, according to Luminate, nearly entirely driven by streaming activity. That marks the biggest week of 2024 by any album, Future’s second-largest week ever and Metro Boomin’s biggest week.

	Also in the top 10 of the new Billboard 200, Olivia Rodrigo’s chart-topping Guts zooms 18-2 following a deluxe reissue with additional tracks, and Hozier’s new four-song EP Unheard starts at No. 10, largely powered by its streaming-driven hit “Too Sweet.”

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new April 6, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on April 2. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	Of We Don’t Trust You’s first-week unit sum of 251,000, SEA units comprise 245,000 (equaling 324.31 million on-demand official streams of the set’s 17 songs), traditional album sales comprise 4,500 (the album was only available to purchase as a digital download through traditional digital retailers including iTunes and the Amazon Digital Music Store) and TEA units comprise 1,500.

	With 251,000 units earned, the album yields the largest week of 2024, Metro Boomin’s biggest week ever, and Future’s second-largest week ever. For the latter, he logged a bigger week only with another joint effort, when his team-up with Drake on What a Time to Be Alive scored 375,000 units in its opening week (Oct. 10, 2015-dated chart), largely powered by traditional album sales.

	










	Further, We Don’t Trust You’s SEA sum of 245,000 translates to 324.31 million on-demand official streams for the set’s songs — the biggest streaming week for any album since Taylor Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) racked up 375.49 million clicks for its 21 songs on the Nov. 11, 2023 chart. We Don’t Trust You also claims the biggest streaming week for any album by Future or Metro Boomin.

We Don’t Trust You was announced on March 8 as the first of a two-album project, with its sequel due April 12.

We Don’t Trust You boasts featured artists Kendrick Lamar, Playboi Carti, Rick Ross, Travis Scott and The Weeknd. However, the set was initially unveiled on March 22 through digital platforms without revealing the featured artists. A few days later, the set’s tracklist was updated to display the guest stars.

	The album’s most-streamed song of the week is “Like That,” a co-billed track with Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar, which sent “social media into an absolute tizzy.” On the track, Lamar “throws several volleys, suggestively targeting Drake and J. Cole.”

	Olivia Rodrigo’s chart-topping Guts flies 18-2 on the Billboard 200 with 73,000 equivalent album units earned (up 155%). The set surges back up the list following its deluxe reissue on March 22 (dubbed the Guts [Spilled] edition) with five additional tracks. The Spilled edition of Guts was issued as a digital download album and via streaming services. It’s not available as a deluxe physical album presently, but will be issued on vinyl on July 19.

	Of the five added songs, four of them (“Obsessed,” “Girl I’ve Always Been,” “Scared of My Guitar” and “Stranger”) were previously issued as bonus tracks on vinyl editions of the original Guts release last year, and then collected for a four-song vinyl EP, Guts: The Secret Tracks, that was issued for Record Store Day Black Friday last November. The fifth added song to the new Guts deluxe is “So American,” a previously unreleased track.

	










	On the Billboard 200, Guts vaults to its highest rank since the Oct. 7, 2023-dated list, when it also placed at No. 2 in its third week on the chart.

	A pair of former No. 1s is next up on the Billboard 200, as Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine falls 1-3 in its third week (72,000 equivalent album units; down 29%) and Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time dips 3-4 (68,000; down 3%). Noah Kahan’s Stick Season is steady at No. 5 with 44,000 (down 3%).

	Former chart-toppers populate Nos. 6-9 on the latest chart, and all are non-movers from the previous week. SZA’s SOS is No. 6 (41,000; down 6%), Taylor Swift’s Lover is No. 7 (40,000; down 1%), Zach Bryan’s self-titled album is No. 8 (39,000; down 3%) and Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is No. 9 (38,000; down 4%).

	Hozier rounds out the top 10 on the new Billboard 200 as his four-song EP Unheard debuts at No. 10. The set earned nearly 38,000 equivalent album units, mostly from streaming activity. Of that starting sum, SEA units comprise 34,000 (equaling 44.15 million on-demand official streams of the set’s four songs), album sales comprise 3,000 and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. Unheard marks Hozier’s fourth top 10-charting effort, following Unreal Unearth (No. 3, 2023), Wasteland, Baby! (No. 1, 2019) and his self-titled set (No. 2, 2014).

Unheard collects four songs that were recorded for, but not included on, Unreal Unearth. Among the four tracks is the gone-viral “Too Sweet,” which drives much of the streaming activity of Unheard. The song was first heard through a teaser snippet during Hozier’s March 6 appearance on the How Long Gone podcast. The clip swiftly went viral through the artist’s fanbase, followed by popularity on TikTok and then a warm embrace on streaming services.
