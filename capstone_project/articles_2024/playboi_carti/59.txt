Future and Metro Boomin have plenty to celebrate as their latest collaborative album, WE DON’T TRUST YOU, garners a significant accolade.

The news was shared via the official Spotify’s official account on X (formerly Twitter) in a post that reads: “On Friday, March 22, Future and Metro Boomin’s WE DON’T TRUST YOU became Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day in 2024 so far.”
That same day, the power duo released a visual supplement for one of its standout tracks, “Type Shit” featuring Travis Scott and Playboi Carti, adding to the hype of the aforementioned joint album.
In it, the four trap titans can be seen surrounded by their crew — including Ken Carson, Doe Boy and CashXO, among other recognizable faces — as they switch roles and jam out to the song in a parking lot and strip club.
Future and Metro Boomin’s new record also includes the song “Like That, ” with a surprise feature from Kendrick Lamar that took the internet by storm on Friday. On it, the former TDE rapper takes a number of shots at his peers, kicking things off with a mention of Drake and J. Cole‘s No. 1 single “First Person Shooter” with accusations of “sneak dissin.’”

“Yeah, get up with me/ Fuck sneak dissin’, first person shooter/ I hope they came with three switches,” he raps.
K Dot then boldly singles out “the big three” — a term often linked to him, Drizzy and Cole — claiming he’s the only one atop the rap chain.

In October, the Dreamville boss mentioned Kendrick’s name and “the big three” on “First Person Shooter,” but crowned himself the greatest, comparing himself to boxing legend Muhammad Ali. “Love when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali,” he raps.
In response, the ‘King Kunta’ MC likens himself to Prince, while implying his legacy will extend beyond that of his peers, who he associates with Michael Jackson.

“Think I won’t drop the location? I still got PTSD/ Muthafuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me/ N-gga, bum, what? I’m really like that/ And your best work is a light pack/ N-gga, Prince outlived Mike Jack’,” he spits.
The Compton native closes out the verse by referencing the Canadian superstar’s 2023 album For All the Dogs and Stephen King’s 1983 novel Pet Sematary with: “N-gga, bum, ‘fore all your dogs gettin’ buried/ That’s a K with all these nines, he gon’ see Pet Sematary.“
