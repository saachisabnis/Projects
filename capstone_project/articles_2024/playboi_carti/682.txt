Destroy Lonely has denied the allegations made by an ex-girlfriend. On Monday, June 24, a woman who goes by @ayishamia on X created an array of posts in which she accused the Opium rapper of physical and mental abuse. In one post, she claimed DL verbally abused her while they were on a 21-hour flight to Germany. After they got to the European country, she claimed the 22-year-old pushed her into a bedframe and caused a bloody injury to her head. She continued with other allegations from their time together and even provided photos. Eventually, she decided to delete all the posts. 
“Cry baby ass n***a,” she wrote. “Mad over Lucki you verbally abused me for an entire 21 hr flight to Germany and when I finally snapped and hit you choked me and and then called my mom to play victim.”“Cracked my head open in Germany after pushing me into a bed frame and then threw all my s**t in the hallway ….. all because i was tired and didn’t want to get up at that exact second to roll a blunt," she continued. In his own posts on X, Destroy Lonely responded to the allegations and claimed he was the real victim. He claimed she beat him up "1000 times" and claimed the injuries she posted were fake. “Everybody who know me in real life knows this aint facts or me im not proving myself to the internet or no woman," he wrote. The "Euros" rapper also deleted his posts soon after they went viral. 
Destroy Lonely is currently signed to Playboi Carti's Opium label. Two years after he joined Carti's imprint, the Atlanta native released his debut album If Looks Could Kill with labelmate Ken Carson as the sole feature. Earlier this month, DL dropped his new single "LUV 4 YA" off his forthcoming LP Love Last Forever that's reportedly set to arrive this Friday.
