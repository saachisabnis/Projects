There were plenty of highlights and unique moments at Tyler, the Creator‘s 10th Camp Flog Gnaw festival at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles over the weekend. But one of the biggest surprises occurred during Matt Champion’s set when BLACKPINK’s Jennie popped out to join him for a run through their collaboration, “Slow Motion.”

	With an ethereal piano figure floating behind them, Jennie exhaled the ballad’s tender lyrics as the crowd quieted down to breath in the special moment, with the pair joining up on the “moving in slow, slow motion” chorus during the live debut of the song.

	Jennie released the solo single “Slow Motion” in March, marking her first collaboration with Brockhampton rapper/singer Champion. The K-pop superstar dropped another solo single, the party anthem “Mantra,” last month. “This that pretty girl mantra/ This that flaunt ‘cha/ Just touched down in LA,” she sings on the dance tune’s chorus.

	In addition to Tyler’s rapturously received set featuring songs from his new Chromakopia album, a two-and-a-half minute teaser trailer that dropped during the festival before The Alchemist and Friends’ set revealed that late rapper Mac Miller’s long-awaited lost album Balloonerism is slated for release “soon.” The album was recorded more than a decade ago and was reportedly slated to be released before the MC’s 2014 mixtape Faces.

	The two day Flog Gnaw fest took over Dodger Stadium on Saturday and Sunday with sets from Playboi Carti, Sexyy Red, Doechii, Erykah Badu, Omar Apollo, Denzel Curry, Vince Staples and many more.
