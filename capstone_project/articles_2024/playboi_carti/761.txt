The Weeknd has released a new song, São Paulo featuring Anitta.
Featuring elements of Brazilian funk, the haunting pop track was debuted live during the Canadian superstar's one night only performance at Estádio Morumbi in São Paulo, Brazil in September, where the Brazilian pop star joined him on stage. Check out its nightmarish video below.
Produced by The Weeknd alongside Mike Dean and Sean Solymar, who also both have writing credits on the song, it marks the third preview of his new album, 'Hurry Up Tomorrow'. It follows the singles Timeless with Playboi Carti, and Dancing In The Flames. 
A release date for the follow-up to 2022's 'Dawn FM' is still to be confirmed.
