Future and Metro Boomin‘s first joint album WE DON’T TRUST YOU is projected to open at No. 1 on next week’s Billboard 200.
HITS Daily Double reports that the collaborative record, which is the first of two from the duo, is estimated to debut with somewhere between 190,000 to 220,000 equivalent album units next week. WE DON’T TRUST YOU’s 17 tracks all charted on Apple Music’s Top 20 on its release day, and the album set a record as Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day in 2024 so far.
The album features guest appearances from the likes of Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Rick Ross and Kendrick Lamar — the last of whom got social media talking with his Drake and J. Cole diss on the track “Like That.” The followup for WE DON’T TRUST YOU is scheduled to drop on April 12.
