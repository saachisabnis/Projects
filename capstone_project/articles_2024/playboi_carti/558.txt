Drake is fanning the flames of his beef with Kendrick Lamar by revealing a collaboration with the Los Angeles native that never saw the light of day. Deep within the archive of Drizzy's "100 Gigs" website, one fan discovered an old clip of the 37-year-old artist and his trusted producer Noah "40" Shebib in the studio as they played a "crazy" beat that Drake wanted Kendrick to hop on. In the brief video, you can see both hitmakers jam out to the instrumental. “For him, where he’s at, I know he’s gonna murder that s**t," Drake said. 
“When you told me Kendrick, it just made so much sense," 40 replied. "Oh, the brilliance! So good.”The clip stems from Drake's studio sessions for his Nothing Was The Same album. In case you're wondering, no, the collaboration never materialized. 40's beat in the video ended up going to Action Bronson, who used it for his track "Actin' Crazy" off the 2015 album Mr. Wonderful. Drake and Kendrick Lamar had already collaborated twice before the studio session in question. In addition to that clip, fans also noticed another potentially shady video that was included in "100 Gigs." In the OVO Fest 2013 folder, there's a video of several people backstage including The Weeknd. At the time, the Canadian natives had already worked together on numerous songs. However, the video shows Drake greeting everyone in the room before he acknowledged Abel's presence. 
It's not clear what Drake's intentions were by including both clips in the content dump, but at this point, fans are running with their own theories. The massive trove of behind-the-scenes footage also includes his newly-released tracks "SOD," "Circadian Rhythm" and "No Face" featuring Playboi Carti, in which he seemingly stirs up rumors of a second round with K.Dot.
