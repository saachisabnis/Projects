A Brooklyn bash featuring rapper and birthday boy Playboi Carti was shut down Saturday night when swarms of fans flocked to the venue, leading to clashes with cops.
The “All Red” singer, who turned 29 on Friday, took to Instagram to vent his frustrations after his ticketed pop-up event at the Brooklyn Warehouse in Crown Heights was called off.
“NYPD SHUT ME DOWN I TRIED SOOO HARD TO CELEBRATE WITH YOU TONIGHT THE MUSIC WAS ABOUT TO BE INSANE I WAS OUTSIDE THE WHOLE TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD LOCK ME UP IF I GOT OUT THE CAR ITS MY F–KIN BIRYHDAY WTF,” wrote the Atlanta native, who was born Jordan Terrell Carter.
Videos show the 3,000-person venue inundated as hordes of excited fans swarm the outside hoping to get in to see the singer.
A clip shared on Instagram captures throngs of the rapper’s supporters clashing with cops, who seem to be trying to break up the massive crowds gathered outside the site. 
Fans can be seen getting testy in the clip, with one yelling, “Yo! What the f–k!” at officers. 
An officer clearly fed up with the feisty fanbase then bellows, “Go home! Go home!”
Some fans in the comment section of the video claimed security wasn’t doing a good enough job managing the event. 
Security allegedly “let people under 21 and without tickets in, people told their friends, and then 10k+ people showed up. Venue is completely responsible,” a fan wrote. 
Other clips taken inside the concert venue show an announcer telling disappointed fans that the show was canceled. 
The NYPD did not return a Post request for comment Sunday.
