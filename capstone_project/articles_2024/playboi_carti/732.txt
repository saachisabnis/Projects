Kanye West has been branded a “sucka” by Charlamagne Tha God over his recent fiery exchange with a member of the paparazzi.
Earlier this week, the Chicago rap star snatched a TMZ reporter’s phone after being asked about rumors he is “controlling” his wife Bianca Censori.

Charlamagne Tha God denounced West on The Breakfast Club on Tuesday (January 30) after reviewing a clip of the altercation, which took place just before Charlie Wilson’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star unveiling.
Charlamagne scoffed at Kanye’s behavior towards the TMZ reporter, saying: “Kanye is a sucka. When that man was yelling at him and his wife last week, he had nothing to say. He skedaddled.”
In his exchange with the female TMZ employee, Kanye was confrontative, stealing her phone and telling her: “I don’t give a fuck. Don’t come ask me some dumb-ass shit. I’m a person, bro! Don’t come ask me that dumb-ass shit. You got kids? Exactly. So what do you do? Who do you work for? Why do you feel like it’s okay?”
The Breakfast Club host reminded listeners that just last week, Ye fled from an angry stranger after he and his wife were accosted in a Los Angeles car park.

“You trying to copy the White folks so fucking bad. You ain’t shit, boy! He thinks he’s so smart, so new, so nifty. And Playboi Carti, too. A little fuckboy. I am a god. Lucifer, homie,” the man yelled at West and Censori.
Ye stayed silent even as the insults continued: “I ain’t no Kid Cudi. I am the realest, boy. Not Hov, not you. I ain’t Lupe Fiasco. I ain’t Mos Def, dawg. I am the one, boy. This is my fucking block. I am homeless 12 years, Ye. I ain’t listened since ’07. Not since Graduation.”

“Mute! Beyoncé mute challenge!” Charlamagne added. “He had nothing to say. Kanye had no smoke for that man last week. Him and his wife, he stood down.”
Charlamagne Tha God has been critical of Kanye West in the past. When the Chicago rap legend was in crosshairs with Pete Davidson in 2022, Charlamagne asserted: “We gotta stop dick-riding dysfunction.”

He added: “Kanye is the epitome of just because someone does something good for you, doesn’t mean they’re good for you.”
