Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign released a trailer yesterday for their often-delayed joint album, Vultures. The video ends with three new release dates for the project, which will apparently be divided into three different volumes. Volume 1 drops Feb. 9, Volume 2 on March 8, and Volume 3 on April 5. West also shared the cover artwork for each version on his Instagram Story. The rappers debuted Vultures at a listening party in Miami in December, and several different release dates have come and gone. The album features Nicki Minaj, Kodak Black, Freddie Gibbs Playboi Carti, and Chris Brown.
