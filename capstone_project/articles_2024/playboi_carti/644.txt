Pharrell Williams‘ life story is on its way to the silver screen — but instead of live action, it will be told through Legos.
According to a Deadline report on Friday (January 26), the Morgan Neville-directed Piece by Piece will hit theaters on October 11, and it will be a film the whole family can enjoy.

Pharrell said in a statement, “When I had this crazy vision to tell this story through Lego bricks, I couldn’t have imagined a better partner than Morgan. He is a legend. Grateful that Focus wanted to collaborate with us and I’m honored to share this with the world and bring people into my universe. Building with Lego bricks encourages us to follow our imagination. … Who would’ve thought that playing with these toys as a kid would evolve into a movie about my life? It’s proof that anyone else can do it too.”
He also posted about the film on Instagram with the accompanying artwork, captioning it with the last two sentences of his above statement. You can view it below.
Ever the multi-hyphenate, Pharrell is busy in his music and fashion bags as well. Earlier this month, the VA native debuted new music at Louis Vuitton’s Western-themed Fall/Winter 2024 fashion show.
One track is a collaboration with folk band Mumford & Sons called “Good People,” which has also been released on streaming services.

Pharrell contributes production and backing vocals on the single, which also features a Native American choir.
Another song played during the event is a previously unreleased collaboration with Miley Cyrus called “Doctor.” The track is reported to be over a decade old and originally intended for Cyrus’ 2013 album Bangerz.

Pharrell was named the creative director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear last year, succeeding the late Virgil Abloh.
The polymath unveiled his latest collection for the luxury fashion house in Paris on January 16 in front of a star-studded audience that included Playboi Carti, Quavo and Gunna as well as Bradley Cooper, Venus Williams and Carey Mulligan.

Longtime friend and collaborator Pusha T was also in the building, walking the runway dressed in a beige tracksuit carrying one of LV’s signature holdalls.
The FW24 collection was inspired by the American Old West, with many of the pieces looking like they’d be at home on a ranch with lots of denim, cowboy hats and suede.

Pharrell talked about the collection and its cowboy iconography after the show.
“When you see cowboys portrayed you see only a few versions,” he said backstage, per The Guardian.

“You never really get to see what some of the original cowboys looked like. They looked like us. They looked like me. They were black and they were Native American.”
