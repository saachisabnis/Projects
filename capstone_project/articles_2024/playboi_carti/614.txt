Future‘s new Mixtape Pluto surprised listeners with what some heard as its Playboi Carti impersonations, as well as its lack of previously-there features — but there should be no surprise at all that the project is on track to have a giant first week.
Hits Daily Doubleis reporting that the set is projected to move between 120-135,000 album-equivalent units in its debut week, which the outlet says will make it tops among new albums. Where it will stand among the overall Billboard 200 album chart is yet to be determined.

Future finally dropped Mixtape Pluto on Friday (September 20) followings months of teasers. It’s the Atlanta rap legend’s first solo mixtape in eight years after his storied run in the mid 2010s.
The project is also his third full-length release of 2024 following We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, both of which were joint efforts with Metro Boomin.

Metro does not have any production on Mixtape Pluto, with producers such as Southside, Wheezy and ATL Jacob supplying the beats.
The 18-track tape is also an entirely solo affair from Future, despite speculation that Travis Scott would appear on the song “South of France.”

Future dedicated Mixtape Pluto to his late mentor and cousin Rico Wade. Future came into Hip Hop as a second generation member of the Dungeon Family, the legendary ATL rap crew, of which Wade was an integral part.
Wade’s mother lived at the house pictured on Mixtape Pluto‘s cover, and Dungeon Family groups like OutKast and Goodie Mob recorded some of their earliest work in a studio (dubbed “The Dungeon”) in its basement.
