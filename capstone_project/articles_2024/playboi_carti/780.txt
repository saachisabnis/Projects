Playboi Carti can’t even use a Finsta account without getting reminded that he hasn’t released an album in four years, as the NBA’s Orlando Magic demonstrated.
On Sunday (September 1), Carti posted to his opium_00pium IG a number of photos of him wearing an Orlando Magic jersey for Penny Hardaway.

That same day, the Magic’s official X account reposted one of the photos, captioning it: “drop the album @playboicarti.”

Neither Future, Travis Scott nor Playboi Carti are strangers to the lineup of the annual festival, which takes place multiple times a year in different cities around the globe.
Over the winter, custom Air Jordans worn onstage by Travis during Rolling Loud Germany went up for auction and ended up fetching nearly $10k.

The shoes were put on the auction site Goldin, where bidding completed at a whopping $9,760. According to the description, the Air Jordans were given as a gift to Egyptian fan Karim Abdelrahman, who was invited onstage to perform with the “SICKO MODE” rapper during the festival.
The custom kicks came with a Letter of Authenticity from Memorabilia Evaluation & Research Services (MEARS) and a Letter of Provenance from Abdelrahman confirming their origin.
