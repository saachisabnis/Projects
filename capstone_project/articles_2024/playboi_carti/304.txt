	With Easter weekend upon us, there are great new music releases for any genre fanatic out this week.

	Kicking things off is Beyoncé’s long-awaited Cowboy Carter album, which features her Hot 100 chart-topper “Texas Hold ‘Em.” In a message posted to Instagram earlier in the month, Beyoncé both stressed that Cowboy Carter is “a continuation of Renaissance” and acknowledged the Billboard chart history she made with “Texas Hold ‘Em.” “I feel honored to be the first Black woman with the number one single on the Hot Country Songs chart,” she shared. “That would not have happened without the outpouring of support from each and every one of you. My hope is that years from now, the mention of an artist’s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music, will be irrelevant.”

	J-Hope also unveiled his fittingly titled mini-album  Hope on the Street Vol. 1. The six-track mini-album was described in a press release as spanning a “diverse array of sounds and moods that showcase j-hope’s musical prowess and depth.” It also features a number of special guests, including band mate Jung Kook on “i wonder,” as well as Benny Blanco and Chic’s Nile Rodgers on “lock/ unlock,” a dance mix of “what if” with Jinbo the SuperFreak and “NEURON” featuring South Korean hip-hop vet Gaeko of Dynamic Duo and yoonmirae.
