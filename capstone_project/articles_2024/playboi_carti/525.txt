Every week, Billboard unveils the top 10 songs on the latest Hot 100 chart. The most recent rankings, for the chart dated March 9, are out now, so let’s run down who had this week’s biggest hits.
The Taylor Swift news cycle never stops, whether its bonus track announcements or concert film trailers. Through it all, though, “Cruel Summer” has stuck around on the Hot 100 top 10.
It’s been a big past few days for SZA: Aside from her Hot 100 success (beyond this song, even, as you’ll see in a minute), she visited Sesame Street and won a BRIT.
McRae’s not getting greedy, but her hit did just move up a spot from last week on the Hot 100.
As “I Remember Everything” holds onto its top-10 status, it continues to crush on other charts. Specifically, it’s No. 1 for the 27th week on both the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts.
SZA has the week’s biggest debut with “Saturn” (the song she teased with a Grammys ad). The track is SZA’s milestone 10th top-10 song on the Hot 100. It also makes her the only artist this week with multiple top-10 songs.
Two breakout hits round out this week’s top 5, starting with Swims’ “Lose Control,” which previously peaked at No. 2.
Then there’s Boone’s “Beautiful Things,” which rises a spot this week to re-approach its previous high at No. 3.
After spending six non-consecutive weeks at No. 1, Harlow’s “Lovin On Me” continues to float around near the top of the chart.
“Carnival” had a major surge this week, after debuting at No. 3 and then falling to No. 4 last week. The boost wasn’t quite enough to dethrone this week’s No. 1, though.
This is the second week at No. 1 for “Texas Hold ‘Em.” Meanwhile, Beyoncé’s hit is also No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart for a third week, after making history as the first song by a Black woman to ever top that chart.
