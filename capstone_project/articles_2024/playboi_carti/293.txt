Earlier this month, Future and Metro Boomin officially announced their latest collaboration. The two albums are announced in a trailer where the two ride twin Rolls Royce trucks into the desert.
The first is We Don’t Trust You, released on March 22. A second album will then be released on April 12.
On Instagram, Metro Boomin delivered a simple statement: “Great things come to those who wait.”
