	Ye has once again named himself the best to ever pick up a mic. In a new Instagram post shared on Thursday (March 28), the rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, called out his peers in Hip-Hop and cited ventures outside of music when asserting himself as on top.  

	The Chicago native’s post features simple black text in all caps on a white background with “:)” written in the caption of his bold claims. 

	“EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA,” began the proclamation. “EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT. EVERYONE KNOWS I BROUGHT ADIDAS TO THIS CULTURE AND I TOOK THEM OUT. EVERYONE KNOWS LOTTA DEMNA VIRGIL JERRY KIM ALL WORKED FOR ME.” 

	










	The 46-year-old continued to uplift his own work. “I MADE YEEZUS DARK FANTASY PABLO GRADUATION THRONE 808S. I AMDE RUNAWAY DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS FATHER STRETCH,” adding, “I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO COME BACK TO NUMBER ONE AFTER CANCELLATION. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOAT. I  STAND BY ME. MY FRIENDS CALL ME YE :).” 

	The lengthy words mirror the Grammy Award-winning artist’s sentiments when he updated his profile picture on the TIDAL streaming app to a photo of a goat last month. The photo swap occurred as he and Ty Dolla $ign celebrated their debut collaborative album VULTURES 1 debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 148,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week of release.

	Debates on who reigns supreme in rap music have been sparked this week by shots fired from Kendrick Lamar at Drake and J. Cole on Future and Metro Boomin’s WE DON’T TRUST YOU collaborative album, which was released earlier this month. 

	“Ni**as clickin’ up, but cannot be legit, no 40 Water, tell ’em/ Ah, yeah, huh, yeah, get up with me,” raps the Compton rhymer.  F**k sneak dissin’, first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches/ I crash out, like, ‘F**k rap, diss Melle Mel if I had to/ Got 2TEEZ with me, I’m snatchin’ chains and burnin’ tattoos, it’s up.”
