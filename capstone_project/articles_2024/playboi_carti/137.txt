“This is your album to [sic], why you’re not in the cover??” wrote the fan, implying that the cover featured a photo of Kanye West wearing a mask (as he’s often wont to do).

With his post, Ty confirmed previous speculation about the person in the photograph on the Vultures 2 cover art. 
On Friday (March 8), Ye and Ty premiered songs from the second installment of their collaboration in Los Angeles, inside what seemed like a warehouse with a limited capacity.

In clips from the event that began making the rounds online, both stars can be seen playing unreleased joints such as “Field Trip/Venom” featuring Playboi Carti, “Promotion” featuring Future, “Take Off Your Dress” and “Fighting Fires.”
The following day, the duo also revealed the album’s artwork. In it, a masked figure can be seen standing in an outfit and setting identical to the Vultures 1 cover, this time by himself. The person, later revealed to be Ty, is holding a framed headshot. Many people thought, and Ty later confirmed, that the photo is of the singer’s brother Jabreal Muhammad aka Big TC.
