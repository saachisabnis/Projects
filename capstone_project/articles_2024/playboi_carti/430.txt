Tickets for the 10th anniversary of the Camp Flog Gnaw festival sold out within minutes of its announcement, and that was before the lineup confirmation, but the wait for details is over.
The event, happening at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Nov. 16 and 17, released its complete programming, and it does not fall short of hip-hop’s most prominent MCs and a few indie rock acts sprinkled in.

Camp Flog Gnaw’s first happened in Los Angeles in 2012 as a block party on Fairfax Avenue to celebrate the release of Tyler’s “Goblin” album. Like Odd Future, the festival has also grown in popularity as an annual music festival and carnival. It often hosts games, rides, activations, pop-up shops for Tyler’s Golf Wang collection and more.
There is some good news for the fans who didn’t get a chance to purchase tickets before the festival sold out. Amazon Music will be returning for the second year in a row to live-stream the event. The Camp Flog Gnaw live stream will be available on the Amazon Music channel on Twitch and Prime Video on Saturday, Nov. 16 and Sunday, Nov. 17. More details on the official live-stream schedules will be shared nearer the event.
