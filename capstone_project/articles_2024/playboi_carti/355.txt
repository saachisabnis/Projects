Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign have yet to put out the second LP in their Vultures series, but a new release date has now inadvertently been revealed.
On Friday (March 15), a Baby Keem fan page on Instagram shared an exchange with the Yeezy boss, who was under the impression that the account was run by the musician it is dedicated to.

In a screen recording, the babykeem.memes profile publicized his DMs with Ye, asking him “When’s the second album?”
“We in the lab now with it,” the Chicago native responded. “Gonna release in May […] May 3rd […] When can we go in […] Should we do Praise God 2mrw.”

A little later, the rapper and producer realized he wasn’t talking to his peer and wrote: “Bro […] I thought you were Keem.”
Earlier this week, Ye and Ty released several songs from Vultures 2, but through unconventional means. Those expecting to find the songs on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music were disappointed as multiple tracks from the record were shared on TikTok and Instagram.
As noticed by several Kanye fan accounts, “River” featuring Young Thug and Leon Bridges and the Backstreet Boys-sampling “Everybody” were available to stream on the social media platforms and could be added as tracks to posts.

Other songs from Vultures 2 were also available, including “Worship,” “Promotion” featuring Future, the James Blake-assisted “Slide,” and “Field Trip,” which is said to feature Playboi Carti, Kodak Black, Lil Durk and Don Toliver.
While the songs’ availability would suggest they were officially released by the duo, the Ye Fanatics fan account claimed that they are simply low-quality rips uploaded by fans.

“The songs from Vultures 2 that were released yesterday are from a fan group,” the account wrote on Twitter. “The audios are distorted and sound bad. A Vultures producer contacted me today to clarify this. We hope to see a change in the next few hours or we will have to wait a little longer for the album to be available.”
