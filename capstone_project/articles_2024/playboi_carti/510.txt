Before his tragic passing, Quan was scheduled to perform in his hometown in a few weeks at Nick Cannon's "Wild N Out," sharing the stage with artists like Waka Flocka and Nardo Wick.
Rumors surrounding Quan's death, speculated to be caused by a drug overdose, have been circulating, though the details are unconfirmed.
He was also set to testify in the trial of former collaborator Young Thug, whose legal troubles involve accusations of gang-related activities.
Fellow artist Playboi Carti led the wave of tributes, sharing clips of the late rapper on his Instagram story.

Born Dequantes Lamar, Rich Homie Quan made his mark on the music scene in 2013 with his breakout hit "Type of Way," which peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard Hot 100.
He followed up with fan-favorite tracks like "Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh)" and "Ride Out," solidifying his place in the rap world.
Quan later teamed up with Young Thug for the Cash Money Records project, "Rich Gang." At the time, the New York Times highlighted him as part of Atlanta's rising generation of hip-hop talent. His most recent track, "Ah'Chi," featured a collaboration with rapper 2Chainz.
In a recent interview, Quan criticized the current state of hip-hop, calling out its violent themes and formulaic approach to songwriting.
Quan had a challenging path to fame. He initially aspired to be a baseball player, but his life took a sharp turn when he dropped out of college and turned to crime after losing his job.
In 2011, at age 21, he was sentenced to 15 months in jail, where he first discovered his passion for creativity.
In a 2014 interview with XXL, Quan reflected on his time in prison: "When I got locked up, I started to think about everything I was good at. When I was a kid I loved to read. Literature was my favorite subject. I loved creative writing classes. So when I got locked up, I read my first book in jail. I have been reading for years, but I read my first book in jail with understanding."
He continued: "When I learned how to really read a book, it took my mind to another place. So after that, then I started writing poems, and after that my poems didn't sound like poems, they sounded like rhymes. I was like, 'Let me see if I can put it on a beat.'"
When he was released, Quan shared that he initially struggled to be taken seriously in the music scene.
"No one took me seriously. By the time I dropped my first mixtape, I knew I wasn't ready. I wanted to let the streets be my observation," the rapper said, per Metro. "I would read every comment I saw. Then I said, 'I got to drop another mixtape. I got to differentiate myself from everybody.'"
He added: "Never saw myself going this far with music. Music was just a hobby at first. I never saw myself being on stage and rocking out shows. After I got out of jail, I started to take it more seriously, and that's when my dream came true."
Rest in peace, Rich Homie Quan.
