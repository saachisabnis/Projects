Rolling Loud, the festival that emerged less than ten years ago, has solidified its position as a festival staple. Since its inception in 2015, the event has consistently curated thrilling lineups. This year, Rolling Loud is taking it up a notch by making its debut in Europe, specifically in Ebreichsdorf, Austria. While attendees can expect top-notch production and a rich history, what truly excites fans is the star-studded lineup, promising an explosive start to the festival. Scheduled for July 5-7, 2024, the festival will feature headliners Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, and Playboi Carti, all of whom have graced a Rolling Loud stage before. Scott, Minaj, and Carti performed at the California event in 2023. Following technical issues, Scott's performance was cut short to just thirty minutes, marking his return to U.S. festivals after the Astroworld tragedy. On the other hand, Carti is a seasoned festival performer, having thrilled audiences at Rolling Loud events in Miami, New York, and Portugal.
Rolling Loud co-founders Matt Zingler and Tariq Cherif expressed their excitement about the European expansion, citing the enthusiastic fan response at previous European shows as a driving force behind their decision to venture into Austria. The festival lineup goes beyond the headliners, featuring a lineup of hip-hop heavyweights such as Gunna, Ice Spice, Don Toliver, Ski Mask The Slump God, and Offset. Other notable acts include Lil Tjay, Unknown, Flo Milli, BabyTron, and Destroy Lonely, an artist signed by Playboi Carti. Sexxy Red, a rising pop sensation, is another act not to be missed, especially considering her significant rise in popularity over the past year. Despite facing criticism for her live performance at Rolling Loud California, Red will have the opportunity to showcase her talents once again to the Vienna audience. Tickets for Rolling Loud Europe will go on sale on April 12 at noon CET.
