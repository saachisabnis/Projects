Boosie has condemned Playboi Carti for posting a photograph of himself wearing a thong online. Boosie criticized Carti's choice of dress, comparing him to a female stripper. He expressed disappointment with the reaction from women, stating that more should have spoken out against the image. He called on women to express their displeasure and encouraged them to take action by creating a hashtag and criticizing the rapper. The outspoken artist ended the discussion by urging women to step up and tell men like Carti that his behavior is not cool. Despite the serious tone, the discussion also had moments of humor, with Boosie warning that if women start declaring their love for men in thongs, all men will start buying them.
