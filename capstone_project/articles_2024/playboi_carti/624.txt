K'Andre Miller and Matt Rempe took to Instagram following a line brawl between the New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils on April 3rd. 
The two heavy weights posted photos from the massive five-on-five bought off of the games opening faceoff. 
Miller captioned his post, "Meet me in the alley w the troops", referencing lyrics from Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert's hit song "Shoota".

The incident began when the Devils started featuring Kurtis MacDermid, who called out Rempe for not fighting in the two rivals' previous meeting on March 11th. 
In response to the lineup decision, Rangers head coach Peter Laviolette started Rempe, the NHL's 6'7 lightning rod. 
The result was not just a fight between Rempe and MacDermid but all five skaters dropping the mitts two seconds after the puck drop. 
The bash on Broadway accumulated 166 penalty minutes. 
Jimmy Vesey was deemed the first to square up with Curtis Lazar, therefore, the other participants were ejected for the rest of the contest. 
Matt Rempe finished the four-game season series against the Devils playing a total of 5:03 minutes, racking up 47 penalty minutes, and three ejections. 
The Rangers swept their cross-river rivals in a season series for the first time since 2014-2015.
