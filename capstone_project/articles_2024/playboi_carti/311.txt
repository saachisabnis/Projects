Chief Keef has been promising a follow-up to his beloved 2013 mixtape Almighty Sofor years, and now he’s finally delivered.
On Friday (May 10), the rapper released Almighty So 2, a 16-track project that features guest appearances from, among others, G Herbo, Lil Gnar, Tierra Whack, Quavo, and Sexyy Red.

In addition, comedian Michael Blackson, who appeared on the original Almighty So, shows up on the new one as well.
Sexyy Red’s verse, on the song “Grape Trees,” should come as no surprise, as she and Keef have been frequent collaborators of late.

They first joined forces in late 2023 for Sexyy’s “Ghetto Princess” and a remix of her track “Bow Bow Bow (F My Baby Dad).” That was followed by “Damn Shorty,” a song from Keef’s Dirty Nachos mixtape with  Mike WiLL Made-It.
In a March interview with Billboard News, the Chicago legend spoke about the rising Midwest MC from backstage at Rolling Loud LA.

Asked by interviewer Tetris Kelly what he believed was the reason, “people go so crazy for Sexyy Red,” Keef’s response was simple: “She just … you could tell she really just come from where we come from.”
Elsewhere in the interview, the “Love Sosa” rapper reflected on why he works so well with the “SkeeYee” rapper.

He explained: “Shit. I just know she fuck with me real heavy. I fuck with her too. Saying she wants to come through and I said “hell fucking yeah.”
