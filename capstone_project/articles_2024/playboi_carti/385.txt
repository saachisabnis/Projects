Playboi Carti has built quite the rabid fanbase during his time in the game, and he was recently forced to move after they discovered his home address.
In Carti’s new Billboard cover story published on Tuesday (September 3), the polarizing rapper revealed that his supporters had not only found his mom’s address — and sent her flowers — but found his too. At that point, he had to move.

“I’m very blessed,” Carti says. “But it is frustrating because [that’s where] we have to lay our heads.”
Carti‘s I Am Music is one of the most anticipated rap albums of 2024, and while fans continue to not-so-patiently wait for its release, producer Cardo shared some insight into its sonic direction elsewhere in the interview.

“Carti’s style is in constant evolution, and he and Cardo already have a name for the sound they’ve been workshopping for the project: ‘burnt music,’” the article reads.
“We’ll be in the studio, like, ‘This music is burnt,’” explained Cardo, who soundtracked Carti’s recent singles “H00DBYAIR,” “EVILJ0RDAN” and the Travis Scott-assisted “BACKR00MS.”

The producer also cited Three 6 Mafia’s DJ Paul and Juicy J, DJ Toomp, The Legendary Traxster and even John Carpenter — the director and composer behind classic horror movies like Halloween, The Thing and Escape From New York — as influences for I Am Music.
While a release date has yet to be announced, Billboard reported that the album is scheduled to arrive before the end of 2024.

“I promise you the album is coming, so it’s only right that I come here tonight and give you a world premiere,” he shouted into the microphone before playing a new track.
Cardo also previously shed light on the project and revealed that Carti has been “finishing” the project for the last four years.

“I’m going to Atlanta to finish up Carti’s shit,” he said in an interview with Lucid Monday that was filmed at SXSW earlier this year. “It’s been crazy — in a good way. It’s been crazy fun, just being able to wake up and he decides to drop a song you produced. It’s weird.
“I’ve known Carti since 2016, but me and him have been working on this new album for a good four years.”
