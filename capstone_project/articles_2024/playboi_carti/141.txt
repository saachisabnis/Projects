Playboi Carti fans have been seriously waiting to hear what he has in store, given the rapper has been teasing a Music album. This would follow his last record, Whole Lotta Red, which dropped back in 2020 — nearly four years ago now. 
Here’s what fans should know, including any new updates, about Carti’s new album. 
Playboi Carti’s Music does not have a confirmed release date. The closest confirmation came from DJ Akademiks last month, where he said it would drop in January — giving only a few more days if Carti has a surprise drop in store. 
The tracklist for the album has yet to be announced. 
Playboi Carti previously dropped a few songs, including “2024,” “Different Day,” “H00dByAir,” and his Travis Scott collaboration, “Backr00ms.” However, these were released exclusively on YouTube, and it’s still unclear if they will make the tracklist for Music. 
Outside of the previously-mentioned Travis Scott feature on “Backr00ms,” which may or may not be on the album, no other actual features for Music have been confirmed. 
Right now, the artwork for music is still TBA. 
Playboi Carti is scheduled to play a handful of shows across North America next month, according to Ticketmaster, but a full tour for Music has not been announced — and the previous Antagonist Tour dates have been delayed.
