            "Backr00ms" is the latest in a flurry of releases from Carti, whose last album, Whole Lotta Red, was released in 2020. Last month he shared the singles "2024" and "Different Day." The former includes Kanye West among its multiple producer credits. 
          

            In 2023, Carti was arrested and charged with assaulting his pregnant girlfriend. He denied the allegations through an attorney. He also appeared with the Weeknd and Madonna on the song "Popular" from the soundtrack for the HBO series The Idol.
