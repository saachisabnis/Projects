Just days ahead of the drop, Future is readying for the release of the long-awaited Mixtape Pluto. The rapper shared the official tracklist for the project, which, in its current form, sees no features on the list.
Based on previews of the album that have circulated the internet – from Future himself and others – the album will feature a slate of contributing artists and producers all of whom just remain hidden on the revealed tracklist.
Some commenters are in search of a Playboi Carti feature (on “Really I’m Trim”) as well as contributions from Baby Keem, while others are content with the feature-less foray, pointing to the rapper’s previous sans-feature projects – 56 Nights and Purple Reign – and how pivotal they were.
