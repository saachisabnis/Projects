Nicki Minaj is The People's Champ for the XXL Awards 2024.
On Monday (Feb. 19), the victor of the People's Champ Award was announced as a result of fan's votes. Nicki Minaj was one of 20 artists nominated this year including Drake, Playboi Carti, Yeat, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Durk and Kid Cudi, among others.
Nicki Minaj being crowned as The People's Champ may not come as a surprise considering the dedicated fan base she has. As the only fan-voted category for the XXL Awards, Nicki's Barbz made sure she came out on top. The Queens rapper has been in full album promo mode for her Pink Friday 2 LP, which arrived last December. For months leading up to the album, Nicki was active on social media more than ever before. The constant communication was a welcome treat for her Barbz.
YoungBoy Never Broke Again was deemed The People's Champ in 2023. The rapper was coming off a prolific 2022 when it came to dropping new music. That year, YB dropped off eight full-length projects, with two of his tapes, Colors and The Last Slimeto, being certified gold for 500,000 copies sold.
While Nicki Minaj was voted in by the people, other XXL Award winners were carefully selected by XXL's esteemed Awards Board.
