Atlanta rap duo Homixide Gang has dropped off a fresh new track, titled “HI-VOLTAGE.” The group, which consists of Homixide Beno! and Homixide Meechie, also released an electric music video, directed by Decat and Taco.
“Skittering over triumphant horns, aural synths and kinetic percussion, the duo unloads a barrage of flexes and NSFW overtures for baddies,” reads the official statement on the song, which was produced by The Weeknd collaborator Cxdy. “Soaked in breathless flows and gleaming production, it’s a soundtrack for show-offs — a celebratory theme song for victory.”

The visual articulates the single’s energetic manifesto with a sinister twist, setting the duo in Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood, where they reenact moments from the 2002 action movie, Shottas.
Homixide Gang, operating under Playboi Carti’s Opium label, continues to define their futuristic trap sound on this latest cut. The group first broke out in 2021 with their debut project Snotty Hill, which was later followed up by several full-length efforts, including Homixide Lifestyle (2022), Snot or Not (2023) and 5th Amndmnt (2023).
