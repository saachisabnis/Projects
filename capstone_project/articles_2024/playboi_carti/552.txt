Tyler, The Creator has shared a new song called Noid.
Offering Black Sabbath-esque guitars, the melodic post-rap offering is only streaming on YouTube, the same as last week's St. Chroma. Head below to view his sepia-toned self-directed video, though it's uncertain whether this is the entire track or an excerpt.
Both Noid and St. Chroma are expected to feature on the Grammy-winner's new album, 'Chromakopia', due out next Monday (October 28). It follows up 2021's 'Call Me If You Get Lost' and its 2023 deluxe edition, 'Call Me If You Get Lost: The Estate Sale'.
The artist also recently unveiled the line-up for his Los Angeles festival Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival at Dodger Stadium in November, with Playboi Carti, Erykah Badu, Blood Orange, Faye Webster, André 3000 and Tyler himself among those set to perform.
