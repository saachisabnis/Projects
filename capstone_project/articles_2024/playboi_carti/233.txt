With all the new music hitting streaming platforms today, Camila Cabello’s fourth studio album, “C,XOXO,” is already making waves. Released on June 28, the pop star features a diverse lineup of collabs. Lil Nas X, City Girls, and Playboi Carti to name a few. But get this, “Hot Uptown,” her song with Drake is shaping up to be one of them ones. 
Drake’s actually is on two songs of ‘C,XOXO,’ 14-track project. In addition to “Hot Uptown,” he’s on “Uuugly,” each produced by El Guincho and Boi-1da.
Back to “Hot Uptown.” Drake opens with a Drake-esq interlude, like it’s his record as he tends to do whilst featured. The production is clearly a summer vibe and feels almost vintage Views-ish with a dance energy close to the somewhat overlooked “Honestly, Nevermind” project he surprised us with last year. 
Cabello shines through as well. It is her record, but Drizzy gets in his pop bag and we kind of forget the stench of his perceived L from the recent Kendrick feud. Emphasis on perceived as not everyone shares the sentiment Drake lost but we should save that argument for another day.
Check this out, the release comes two weeks after Cabello teased her fans, with previews of both songs. 
Now each record is finally here and there’s a visualizer for “Hot Uptown” if you want to vibe to Camila’s image in a pool for added content. Let us know what you think.
