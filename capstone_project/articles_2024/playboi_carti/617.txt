Tickets go on sale this Friday (August 16) at 12 PM Eastern. Check out the full lineup below.
Neither Future, Travis Scott nor Playboi Carti are strangers to the lineup of the annual festival, which takes place multiple times a year in different cities around the globe.
Over the winter, custom Air Jordans worn onstage by Travis during Rolling Loud Germany went up for auction and ended up fetching nearly $10k.

The shoes were put on the auction site Goldin, where bidding completed at a whopping $9,760. According to the description, the Air Jordans were given as a gift to Egyptian fan Karim Abdelrahman, who was invited onstage to perform with the “SICKO MODE” rapper during the festival.
The custom kicks came with a Letter of Authenticity from Memorabilia Evaluation & Research Services (MEARS) and a Letter of Provenance from Abdelrahman confirming their origin.

One person who may not be seen on the Rolling Loud lineup for some time is Lil Uzi Vert, however.
In November, the “Just Wanna Rock” hitmaker was announced as one of the headliners for Rolling Loud California 2024, but they quickly denied ever committing to the gig.

Taking to their Instagram Story shortly after the lineup was revealed, Uzi tagged the popular festival while calling them out for what was apparently a premature announcement.
“I never said I was doing rolling loud,” Uzi wrote after the lineup was first revealed, naming them as a headliner as well as Nicki Minaj and Post Malone. “Don’t understand why my name is on here @rollingloud.”

Uzi was later replaced by Future and Metro Boomin, who performed their then-newly released joint album, We Don’t Trust You.
