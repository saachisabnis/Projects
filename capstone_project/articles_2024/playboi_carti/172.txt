The shimmering chain, dubbed “YVL,” was designed by jeweler Alex Moss who has also provided custom pieces for the likes of Drake, A$AP Rocky and Chief Keef.
The chain could be seen around Ice Spice’s neck when she entered the venue with Swift and actress Blake Lively, as well as when the trio were celebrating the winning touchdown thrown by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
Ice Spice and Playboi Carti have been flirting online for a while after the rapper blatantly made it known he was eyeing up the Bronx star on his track “BACKR00MS.”
He rapped: “I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah I want me a munch.”

The Atlanta native then ramped up his romantic pursuit by reposting Ice Spice’s recent birthday thirst trap on his Instagram Stories.
The provocative slideshow, which included photos of Ice flashing her bum to the camera while wearing a figure-hugging mini dress and thong, had already sparked a flood of horny reactions from fans.

In response, the “Princess Diana” star seemingly approved of Carti’s namedrop by reposting “BACKR00MS” on her own IG Stories, with Carti in turn resharing her post on his own page with a heart eyes emoji.
It appears the pair also took the flirting to the DMs as Carti then posted a screenshot of a message from Ice Spice that read: “backr00ms” with a suggestive kiss mark emoji.
