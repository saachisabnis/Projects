	“FE!N” was featured on Scott’s fourth album, Utopia, which he released on July 28, 2023, through his label Cactus Jack and Epic Records. The set debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making it the Houston rapper’s third chart-topping album, and spent four weeks at the top. Utopia was nominated for best rap album at the 2024 Grammy Awards, where Scott performed “FE!N” alongside Carti as well as “My Eyes” and “I Know” in a fiery medley. Carti is nominated for best rap song for his feature on Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign‘s “Carnival,” also featuring Rich the Kid, at the 2025 Grammy Awards.

	Scott made a spectacle out of the song during his recent Circus Maximus Tour, performing it 10 times in a row during his stop at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center last December, and eight times during his stop at Milan’s Ippodromo Snai La Maura, where Italian locals mistook the rumbling from the show for an earthquake.
