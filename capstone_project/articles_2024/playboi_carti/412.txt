“Durk sent in a verse and he said, ‘Take my Yeezy shirt off and make it a doormat.’ He said it four times. I hit him up and said, ‘You’re breaking my heart. Who told you to do this?’ I’m like, ‘Man, this is bad for the city. Who told you to do this?’
“It’s like when J. Cole did the diss track [‘False Prophets’] or whatever. You got Drake, he’s really paid to come at my neck. But it’s another thing for somebody like that to come around you — it’s the whole friends/enemies talk.”
He added: “He must have never really liked me. I don’t know exactly what it is. I spoke to this man a few times about the line and then he changed the line to: ‘I take my Yeezy hat off and give my lil’ hoe that.’ And I’m just like, ‘Why y’all think y’all can play with me?'”
Kanye appeared to be referencing Durk’s verse on the unreleased track “Field Trip,” which also features Playboi Carti and Kodak Black is rumored to appear on Vultures 2.
A snippet of the song leaked in February and found the OTF frontman rapping: “My new Yeezy hat, gave my lil’ hoe that.”

Kanye also said in his interview with Justin Laboy that he was more hurt by Durk’s lyrics than he was by him joining Drake on tour.
In a past Instagram rant, the G.O.O.D. Music founder slammed Drizzy for recruiting Durk for his It’s All a Blur – Big as the What? Tour in the middle of his Vultures rollout.

Explaining the move in an interview with Akademiks, Durk said: “He actually did my whole album, but I ain’t use it … He tweaked with the beat, he put some vocals behind some beats. He played with a couple records. I’ma say that, he played with a couple records … He did some genius shit.”
He added: “I had went to the hotel where he was at. He was actually in a good head space. I guess all the bullshit that was going on with him was getting to him, but he definitely in a good space.”
