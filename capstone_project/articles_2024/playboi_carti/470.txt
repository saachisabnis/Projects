Drake has appeared to react to Kanye West dissing him with help from a viral 50 Cent video.
Earlier this week, Ye took a shot at longtime rival Drizzy after his “Carnival” collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Kanye’s latest issue with Drake stems from the Toronto rapper recruiting Lil Durk for his It’s All a Blur — Big as the What? Tour in the middle of the promotional campaign for his and Ty Dolla’s Vultures 1 album
After calling out adidas, the Daily Mail and other perceived enemies in a scathing Instagram post, Ye wrote: “And it’s fuck Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more fuck you’s.”

Drake seemingly responded on his Instagram Stories on Wednesday (March 13) by posting a meme of 50 Cent saying: “What he say fuck me for?”
The original clip, posted in 2014, saw 50 responding to Floyd Mayweather after finding out he dissed him alongside T.I. and Nelly.

“I woke up and I look at the computer and the computer said Floyd said, ‘Fuck T.I., fuck Nelly and fuck 50,’” Fif said in the video. “I’m like, ‘What he say fuck me for?’ Nelly fucked your first baby mama Melissa then took your fuckin’ fiancé. Say fuck that n-gga.”
The video had previously been used in a number of viral social media posts joking about what Drake’s reaction would be to Kanye’s diss.
Drake and Kanye West’s long-simmering feud threatened to reignite last year after the 6 God addressed their turbulent relationship on the Scary Hours deluxe edition of his For All the Dogs album.
“Every time you need me for a boost, I never hesitated/ Every time that Yeezy called a truce, he had my head inflated/ Thinkin’ we gon’ finally peace it up and get to levitatin’/ Realize that everything premeditated,” he rapped on “Red Button.”

Drake also appeared to subliminally diss Kanye on “Stories About My Brother” while referencing him walking around barefoot.
“I can’t wait for the day that you choose to retire your stuff/ Taking off the sneakers ’cause you tired of tying ’em up/ That one day you wake up and tell ’em, ‘Enough is enough’/ That’s how you gon’ find out you not Kobe Bryant to us [laughs]/ Man, you not Kobe Bryant to us… at all,” he spit.

The beef previously reached a boiling point in 2021 in the run up to their respective albums Donda and Certified Lover Boy before they briefly reconciled for the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert in Los Angeles.
Drizzy is even alleged to have slept with Ye’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian when they were still married, although the reality star denies this claim.
