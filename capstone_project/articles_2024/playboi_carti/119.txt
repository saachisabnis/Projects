Kanye West has a long list of people he’s got problems with, which now includes none other than Jesus Christ himself.
Yeezy and Ty Dolla $ign stopped by Big Boy TV to discuss all things Vultures on Friday (March 15), though the interview took a turn when the radio personality asked Kanye about his current relationship with Christianity.

Big Boy began by asking West about his current religious feelings, and West was more than happy to explain his outlook.
He began: “I have my issues with Jesus. There’s a lot of stuff I went through, that I prayed, and I ain’t see Jesus show up … I had to put my experience in this world, my experience with my children, my experience with other people, my experience with my account, my experience with my brand, and my experience with the level of music that I was dealing with in my own hands.
As is often the case with Kanye, his answer moved in multiple directions, touching on racism, gentrification and more.
He added: “A lot of times I feel like in our society, in America, people, Christians, we depend on Jesus so much that we won’t put in the work ourselves. The main thing I don’t rock with is like, ‘I’m gonna pray for you.’ It’s just like, you can actually physically do something yourself, too, more than just praying.

“We’re so in this mentality that that’s all that needs to happen, but we ain’t praying our way out of prison, we ain’t paying our way out of the abortion clinics, we ain’t praying our way to get our land back that was always ours after gentrification, after the Harlem Renaissance and Black Wall Street was burnt to the ground. Them prayers ain’t working.”
West got dangerously close to referencing his anti-semitic scandal, but quickly reversed course.

He concluded: “We’ll have to apply actual, physical building partnerships … It don’t start unless we can really be real with each other and say: ‘This is what I did, this is what I did.’ I’m not gonna third rail our interview, but look at the power of what happened when me and Kyrie was on the same page. That’s what’s scary. But that’s what they put us each in a silo and say: ‘Your grandma gonna lose her crib.’
“You know how many threats we been dealt? And I didn’t pray my way through those threats, either. I had to get up and do it myself. I had so much to do I ain’t have time to pray … Look at where I’m at today.”
