Boosie Badazz has compared Playboi Carti to his baby mother Iggy Azalea after he was pictured wearing something similar to a thong.
Carti was pictured in February rocking a bizarre mesh one piece that resembled a thong at the waist while hitting the studio with Kanye West.

Boosie has now chimed in with some commentary on the outfit, and needless to say the openly homophobic rapper wasn’t impressed.
He said on Instagram Live: “You saw the boy just put a thong on, bro. He put a thong up his ass, bro. You mean to tell me a man can put a thong up his ass and not think about being a female?

“Did you see him? With those piercings and put a thong up his ass? If you mean to tell me a man can put a thong up his ass and still feel like a man. Man, if you wore a thong, you thought about getting inserted.”
“Playboi Carti, who stuck a thong up his ass. See through. A thong up your ass. A string,” he continued. “He sagged it so you can see the thong penetrating his ass like a toothpick in the mouth. Y’all mean to tell me he did that and didn’t feel like a woman? A see through thong up your ass. He want to be a woman.”
The Baton Rouge native then said that Carti must have been “jealous” of his ex-girlfriend Iggy Azalea, who he shares a child with.
“He must have got jealous of his baby mama,” he continued. “Man, what’s that girl name? White girl. Iggy. Iggy’s ass is beautiful with a thong on. Did you get mad and go into competition?
