As a twenty-something living in Los Angeles, Sagan Lockhart found himself drawn to those he envisioned on the cusp of something greater. The emerging photographer made a name for himself capturing hip-hop acts such as Playboi Carti and Mac Miller right before their music blew up, and eventually, became a coveted part of their inner circles.
“To me, it was always important to build mutual relationships,” he says. “What I was really looking for is these up-and-coming artists that I could see had some sort of potential. You know, this guy’s going to be the shit.”
Lockhart was tapped to be the unofficial photographer for OFWGKTA. Following the group’s disbandment, he joined Earl Sweatshirt on the road as his tour manager.
After a few good years in the music scene, he realized he could apply his creative eye and penchant for cultivating trusting relationships to tackle marketing and strategy for brands like HUF and Diamond Supply.
2020 marked the year Lockhart’s own brand, AMFM, was born. While skating culture in the city was dampened by the pandemic, the visionary sought a way to connect fellow skaters and cultivate a sense of community through the period of isolation.
“We spent over a year developing this formula and trying different factories, just trying to get it right,” Lockhart says.
