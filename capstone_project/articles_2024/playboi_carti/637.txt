Jacquees and Boosie Badazz were the first artists to pay their respects to the Atlanta rapper on social media. “Rest in Peace my brother Rich Homie Quan. I love you for Life. #Richgang,” tweeted the R&B singer and Decatur, Georgia, native. He then posted a picture of the two hanging out at a party and wrote, simply, “Legend.”
