Playboi Carti‘s next album has been one of the most anticipated projects in Hip Hop for years at this point, and he has now assured fans that it is due soon.
During a performance at Splash! Festival on Friday (July 5), King Vamp took a moment to let his fans know that his third LP is in the works as he premiered a new song to the roaring crowd.

Playboi Carti operates on an entirely different wavelength than most of his peers, and the creative process behind his upcoming album is a testament to that.
In an interview with Numéro Berlin published last year, the Atlanta native was asked about his subject matter and lyricism in the context of evolving as an artist.

“I feel like my mind is just so broad and I’m really onto the next thing so fast,” he responded. “When you think too hard about certain things, it stops you from being creative. Like, it just alters certain shit. So I really try to stay out my head, I try to stay out my phone, and I just try to lock in. I’m in my surroundings.”
He continued: “I’ve been recording in Paris, I love Paris. Amazing. I was recording, in a cave, for like three months, and all the music that came out of that is just chaotic and crazy. Then, I’m in a glass house, somewhere in the hills, and the music there is just very good to the ears.

“And then, I’m in Atlanta and the tensions are just high and the music is biting. So, it’s the little things like that that keep me going, because I’m just trying to talk to myself.”
Carti’s last project, Whole Lotta Red, was released to critical acclaim back in 2020. As of now, a release date and title for the new album has yet to be announced.
