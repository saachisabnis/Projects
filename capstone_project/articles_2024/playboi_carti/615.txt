The Tyler-curated festival is going down at Los Angeles' Dodgers Stadium this weekend (November 16-17)
Doechii has been in collaboration mode at Camp Flog Gnaw 2024, singing ‘Persuasive’ with SZA and ‘Balloon’ with Tyler, The Creator.
The annual event is taking place at Los Angeles’ Dodger Stadium this weekend (November 16-17), with Tyler once again curating the line-up and taking one of the headline slots.
During Saturday’s action, Tampa rapper Doechii took to the stage for her own set, and welcomed 2024 Glastonbury headliner and her Top Dawg labelmate SZA for a version of their 2022 collaborative remix of ‘Persuasive’.
Later in the day, during Tyler’s headline set, Doechii made a second appearance, joining for a performance of ‘Balloon’, their joint effort from Tyler’s newly-released album ‘Chromakopia’.

Tyler’s set also included guest appearances from Schoolboy Q on recent single ‘Thought I Was Dead’ and Sexyy Red, who joined him on their song ‘Sticky’, which you can also catch above.
‘Chromakopia’ was released last month, and NME awarded it three stars, writing: “Within the chaos [of the album], there’s beauty — the sensitivity of ‘Hey Jane’, the infectious hip-hop bite of ‘Thought I Was Dead’, the rising cacophonies of brass and percussion on ‘I Killed You’. But perhaps a less frantic approach would’ve benefited the listen overall.”
Since the release, Tyler has announced more dates for his massive ‘Chromakopia’ world arena tour. He’s added three shows in his hometown of Los Angeles, along with New York, Austin, and Seattle, while adding on to his European leg with another Paris date. Australia has also received three new shows on the tour.
Other names on the bill at Camp Flog Gnaw this year include Playboi Carti, Erykah Badu, André 3000, Vince Staples, Omar Apollo, Faye Webster and RAYE. There will also be a special tribute performance to the late MF DOOM, who died in 2020.
The festival’s last edition took place in 2023, following a four-year break. Artists that performed included SZA, Turnstile, PinkPantheress, Clipse, Kevin Abstract and Paris Texas.
The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.
