Iggy Azalea recently opened up about her role as a parent on the Dinner’s On Me podcast, revealing that she’s essentially raising her son, Onyx, as a single mother. Despite sharing Onyx with her ex, Playboi Carti, Azalea made it clear that she handles the bulk of parenting responsibilities alone. “I’m very much a single mother,” she stated. “I’m very much the only parent, no disrespect, but yes, I am not co-parenting really, and that’s just the reality of it. It’s one, it’s 24/7.”
In the podcast, Azalea also discussed how her role as a single mother has shifted her focus. She expressed a desire to be more present in her son’s life, saying, “I no longer want to be traveling around everywhere, I want to take my son to school. I want him to have memories with me and give him that time.” She credited her mother for her own success, emphasizing the importance of her presence in Onyx’s life. “I owe my success in large part to my mother because she spent so much time with me and she just really gassed me up and made me think I was a superwoman genius, dancer extraordinaire, painter extraordinaire, chef, whatever it was. And it’s important to me, even when my son’s only 4, that I know I’m there, instilling that confidence in him and just helping guide him.”
Azalea concluded by asserting her commitment to parenting. “It’s my job as a parent. I think if you’re going to have a child, you should be prepared to do that and engage in that way. And I really want to. I toured two years with my son on a bus and it was time for that to end.” As of now, Playboi Carti has not commented on Azalea’s single mother remarks.
