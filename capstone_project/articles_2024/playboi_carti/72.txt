Zack Fox is like that one friend who always has a new job. He’s a comedian, rapper, actor, and internet creator. He first gained attention on social media, where his posts on platforms like Twitter and Instagram went viral, but I discovered him through his freestyle with Kenny Beats, “Jesus is the One (I Got Depression)”, back in 2019. I have followed him on and off ever since.


Recently, I caught his interview with Yedoye Travis on That’s Deep, a series I’ve been hooked on since it launched. Before watching them talk about cartoons, furries and the apocalypse, I got an ad that Zack was DJing at Cervantes Masterpiece, an hour away from CSU. So I got tickets. Here’s what you missed:


When I first went in I noticed we weren’t directed to the main stage, but the soundbooth. I guess Zack wanted a “boiler room” style set and wanted everyone to circle around him, which was an approach I liked. I stood at the barricade and waited for the openers to enter the stage.


From 8:30 to 9:30 DJ Beloved opened with a set of ethereal beats. I mean, she was such a good DJ she melted my mind. Her set I would describe as R&B fused with house funk. Some of her set was melancholic while the other part was hype and energetic. Overall, I could not stop dancing her entire set. She closed her set with Nasty by Tinashe and I don’t think I have ever screamed harder.


Then they opened with Prysalis at about 9:30 who played hip hop house. The crowd was so lovely the entire set. I would describe Prysalis as jersey beats mixed with hip hop, fused with funk house. One of the girls I was with described it as a “ Fred again.. vibes.” I was jumping the whole set and everyone around me was dancing.

Zack kicked off his set at 10:30, declaring, “We’re in a historically Black venue in a historically Black neighborhood, so let’s celebrate historically Black artists and get freaky for the next hour and a half!” He then dove right into his set, starting with Mariah Carey. He followed up with “Saturday Love” by Cherrelle.


He played mostly 90’s remixes but mixed one 90’s song with Playboi Carti’s “Location,” and the energy only intensified with “All Red,” following it. A standout moment was his rendition of “In the Sanctuary” by The Kurt Carr Singers. His praise session remix made the venue jump. The night continued with him playing Young Thug’s “Lifestyle,” but my favorite part was how he wrapped up the concert with a breakcore set, mixed “F My Baby Dad” by Sexyy Red.


People say “not everyone can be good at everything,” but this is certainly not the case in Zack Fox’s career. His performance was lively, creative, and entertaining and I was so glad I got the opportunity to experience it. However, sometimes writing about it isn’t enough, and you just have to see for yourself.
