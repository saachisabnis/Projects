Ye and Ty Dolla $ign officially released a video for “CARNIVAL,” the Vultures Volume 1 track featuring Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti.
Jon Rafman, who also contributed to Hypebeast Magazine Issue 32, helmed the visual while Dario Alva and Garrett McGale worked on the CGI. The video arrives as “CARNIVAL” moved up to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving West his fifth chart-topper, Ty’s second and Rich the Kid and Carti’s first. This also makes Ye the only rapper in history to have topped the Hot 100 chart in three different decades — the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.
“CARNIVAL” earned 33.7 million streams, 3.9 million radio airplay impressions and sold 3,000 downloads in the week of March 1 to March 7. It retained its third week on top of the Streaming Songs chart and jumped to No. 13 on the Digital Song Sales chart.
