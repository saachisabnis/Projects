Former president Donald Trump had a few things to say about Ye and Young Thug during his viral appearance on Adin Ross' stream. On Monday, August 5, the Republican nominee for president made his debut on Ross' live-streamed show to the tune of 50 Cent's "Many Men" — a song that supporters attached to Trump following his assassination attempt last month. During their conversation, Trump attempted to appeal to Gen-Z voters by discussing his thoughts about trending topics like Thug's YSL trial in Georgia. "I heard it from other people where they say Young Thug is being treated very unfairly," Trump said. "So he's got to be treated fairly."  
Elsewhere in the conversation, Trump also speaks about his old friend Ye. The rapper formerly known as Kanye West was an avid supporter of Trump during the former POTUS' time in office. He and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian made headlines when they met with the president at the White House in 2018. Ye continues to support Trump, however, 45 believes the controversial rapper is a bit "complicated" nowadays. "He’s very complicated," Trump said. "He’s a really nice guy, but he can get himself into trouble and get some other people, but you know. He’s got a good heart, he does. But he’s complicated." 
Ross and Trump ended their conversation by listening to some new music in a customized Telsa Cybertruck that features the former president's infamous photo from his assassination attempt. Footage from their car session created a meme that produced scenes of the duo listening to snippets from Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert and more.
