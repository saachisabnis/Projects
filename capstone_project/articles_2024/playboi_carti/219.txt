Ice Spice has been accused by Andrew Tate of consorting with the devil due to her behavior and outfit choice at the Super Bowl.
The controversial influencer made the wild claims during an episode of his Tate Speech podcast, where he called his followers’ attention to the “Munch” rap star’s upside-down cross and “devil symbols.”

“On a very serious, serious note, you have someone wearing an upside-down cross, making devil symbols at the biggest cultural event in American history,” he said, referring to Super Bowl LVIII’s record-breaking viewing figures.
“Everything I said about how you can see demons if you pay attention, did you look at her [Ice Spice] and think that’s a demon? Maybe you didn’t, but after listening to this, please pay attention.”

He continued: “She is wearing an upside-down cross. The matrix has made her famous. Nobody knows why. It’s certainly not because of fucking talent. And she’s wearing Balenciaga which are child molesters and she’s making devil symbols.
“What kind of clue are you looking for if those aren’t the clues you need?!”
Ice Spice was seen throwing up the “sign of the horns” hand gesture while in attendance at the Super Bowl and while Andrew Tate seems to think it’s a sign of Satanism, the sign — known as the Karana Mudrā — is actually considered an apotropaic gesture to expel demons in Buddhism.
As for her “upside-down cross,” the chain was designed by jeweler Alex Moss and made in collaboration with Playboi Carti’s Opium brand.

Carti, who has faced his fair share of devil-worshipper accusations, posted a photo of the Bronx native wearing the diamond-encrusted jewelry on his Instagram Stories.
Tate isn’t the first right-wing figure to publicly criticize Ice Spice. Earlier this month, conservative political commentator Candace Owens slammed the 24-year-old rapper over her latest single “Think U the Shit (Fart),” accusing her of setting America’s youth back.

“If you’re wondering whether it’s a good song, what do you think? It’s called ‘Think U The Shit (Fart).’ Now I think we can all admit we have fallen as a society,” she said on her podcast.
“I wouldn’t say that was Mozart or Beethoven but I’m not these mainstream media publications who rush to defend this type of music like they did with ‘WAP,’ the most disgusting and filthiest lyrics I’ve ever read,” she added, referencing Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion‘s raunchy hit single.

Owens then quoted a positive review of the song before saying: “This is the reason nobody reads this crap anymore. You guys lie about the big stuff and you lie about the dumb stuff. I just want to live in a society where we can all acknowledge that a song that’s titled ‘Think U The Shit (Fart)’ is in fact itself a shit fart.”
