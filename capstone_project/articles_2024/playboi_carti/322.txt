Ye and Ty Dolla $ign are reportedly ready to drop the next installment of their album series. On Wednesday, July 31, the official Yeezy website posted a promising update for Â¥$ fans. The statement said "all orders fulfilled" along with an announcement about their upcoming album Vultures 2. Ye and Ty's album was scheduled to come out in March as part of a three-part trilogy, however, it was postponed to a later date. After hosting several listening sessions around the world, the duo is set to release volume two this Friday. "VULTURES 2 COMING AUGUST 2ND," Ye's website said. 
The first volume dropped in February and contains hits like "CARNIVAL" with Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti as well as "Back To Me" featuring Freddie Gibbs. "CARNIVAL" held the No. 1 slot on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 19 weeks on the chart. It was the first time Ye topped the charts in 13 years for his collaboration with Katy Perry "E.T." It was also his first top-charting song as a solo artist since his 2007 hit "Stronger." There have been a lot of rumors about who will appear on Vultures 2. The late Takeoff will reportedly be featured on the project. Take's posthumous verse will appear on the track "Let Me Chill Out" with Rich The Kid and NBA YoungBoy. Some fans feel cynical about Ye's latest target release date. Earlier this year, he told Justin Laboy that he planned to release the album on May 3. However, the date came and went without a sign of the album. Vultures 2 will allegedly arrive on Friday, August 2.
