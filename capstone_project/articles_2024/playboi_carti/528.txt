	The three-pack, which Elliott Wilson hilariously dubbed Lucian’s Loosies, includes “No Face” featuring an assist from Playboi Carti along with solo tracks “Circadian Rhythm (The Language 2)” and “SOD,” which is a solo version of the “Super Soak” record that Kai Cenat played on his live stream earlier in August.

	Except “SOD” has now removed Yachty’s verse from the track. They previously ran into sampling issues when  Mr. Hotspot refused to clear vocals due to the song’s explicit nature. DJ Akademiks teased a music video on the way for “SOD” as well.

	“No Face” finds Drake teaming up with Playboi Carti for the first time since “Pain 1993” landed on 2020’s Dark Lane Demo Tapes. Drizzy floats over the distorted production and addresses those he feels stabbed him in the back.

	“They emptied the clip, quick, swapped that s–t out and I came back reloaded/ I’m just so happy that n—s who envied and held that s–t in got to finally show it/ I’m over the moon, yeah, we’ll see you boys soon,” he raps. 

	Produced by Gordo, “Circadian Rhythm” also serves as a sequel to “The Language,” which originally landed on Nothing Was The Same as a fan-favorite in 2013. Drizzy opens up about how the rap game has planned funerals for him in the past, but he continues to bounce back like a cat with nine lives. “How many funeral dates they plan for me and I dodged it like the truck,” he spews.

	This isn’t the first leak of its kind from Drake on the plottttwistttttt account. His first dump came with a trio of songs earlier in August as part of the 100 Gigs delivery featuring collaborations with Latto, 21 Savage and Young Thug. The three-pack eventually hit streaming services and all of the songs debuted on this week’s Billboard Hot 100.

	It remains to be seen if the latest drop will land on streaming services in the coming days. Listen to the leaks below.
