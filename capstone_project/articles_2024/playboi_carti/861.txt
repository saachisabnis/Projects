Kanye West did not permanently replace his teeth with an $850,000 titanium grill, despite reports this week that claimed he did.
On Thursday (Jan. 18), sources close to Kanye informed The Shade Room that Ye did not remove his teeth to put in a new metal mouthpiece. On Wednesday (Jan. 17), Daily Mail had incorrectly reported that Kanye had removed all of his teeth to put in titanium chompers that reportedly cost $850,000 and were designed entirely by Kanye.
"No, #KanyeWest did not have his teeth removed to install his latest mouth piece. Sources close to Kanye exclusively confirmed to The Shade Room, that #Ye still has his chompers underneath his new dental prosthesis," The Shade Room wrote in their Instagram post.
The metal grills Ye is wearing appear to be inspired by the James Bond villain Jaws.
On Wednesday (Jan. 17), fans had a lot to say when Ye unveiled the grills for the first time on his own Instagram story and in a text message to Playboi Carti, who shared the text exchange between him and Ye on Instagram.
"My big brother. N***a can't tell me s**t," Carti captioned the post.
However, a lot of fans were not enthusiastic about the new look. Many of them compared the grills to aluminum foil or a gum wrapper being placed over Kanye's teeth.
