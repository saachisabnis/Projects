Tyler, The Creator’s new album has continued to cement itself as one of Hip Hop’s most commercially successful albums of 2024, topping the Billboard 200 for a third consecutive week.
The project, which debuted atop the chart earlier this month, reclaimed the number one spot after earning 104,000 equivalent album units over the last week, according to Billboard.

This pushes the album’s total sales to over 560,000 in just three weeks, making it eligible for Gold certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).
CHROMAKOPIA opened with an impressive 299,500 first-week units, despite having a shorter tracking week due to it being released on a Monday instead of the usual Friday, before moving 160,000 in its second week.

The album also marks Tyler’s longest-running stint atop the Billboard 200, surpassing 2021’s Call Me If You Get Lost and 2019’s IGOR.
CHROMAKOPIA has also powered the Odd Future founder to new heights on the Billboard Hot 100, with “St. Chroma” and “Noid” becoming his first top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 at number seven and number 10, respectively.
