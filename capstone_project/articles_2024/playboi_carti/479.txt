Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign released the second installment of their highly-anticipated Vultures series, Vultures 2 on Saturday (Aug.3). Spanning 16 tracks, the project serves as West’s fourth collaborative album. The duo tapped artists like Playboi Carti, and Don Toliver, to appear on the project. The late TakeOff will also make a posthumous appearance, per Rolling Stone. While the numbers aren’t in yet, the project will likely top the charts. Vultures 1, reached the top spot on the Billboard 200 upon its release. 
According to Billboard, the pair will host a series of listening parties throughout South Korea and Taiwan. The project endured several delays and setbacks, but luckily the two have been able to give fans what they want. The collaboration was a surprise, especially amid the recent controversy surrounding West. The now disgraced mogul found himself in hot water after making a series of anti-Semitic comments in 2022. He even appeared on far-right, conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones’s show where declared his love of Adolf Hitler. 
Not long after, brands like Balenciaga and Adidas cut ties with the controversial star. However, for Ty Dolla $ign, he “doesn’t give a f*ck” about what anyone has to say about it. “Ye is the best artist of this generation, besides me, and I don’t give a f*ck about what people were talking about. I know my n*gga. He’s one of the best people I’ve ever met,” he tells the outlet in a recent interview. 
“Just with my analysis of how it goes with him, he goes all the way to the top. And something may happen and he’ll say [something people find offensive] — and then people [get] right back, you know. Because this sh*t is undeniable.”
