Playboi Carti had an uncomfortably short interview with Adin Ross earlier this month, and has now revealed that it was because of his shyness.
The “Magnolia” rapper called into Ross’ livestream on Thursday (February 15) where he shared some insight into why his earlier appearance was so awkward.

The online personality said: “Yo, Carti, we gotta do part two at the warehouse. You gotta come to Miami and come do it.”
Carti responded: “Aight, bet.” Ross then asked: “Are you excited?” The Die Lit rapper said: “You know me, I’m just tryna goddamn keep rapping, keep going crazy.”

Adin then said: “I need you to talk this time to me now, bro.”
Carti chuckled, before adding: “You know I’m shy as fuck, I don’t mean no harm.”
The interaction refers to an encounter earlier this month when Playboi Carti appeared on Adin Ross’ livestream for a peculiarly short amount of time, though he did use his segment on air to deliver an important message about his upcoming album.
The Atlanta rapper joined the 23-year-old on Kick after performing with Travis Scott at the 2024 Grammys Awards.

Ross asked Carti about his upcoming album, which he has been teasing for months.
“Mind-blowing,” the rapper responded succinctly. “My best. My very best — it’s actually insane.”

The brevity of Ross’ exchange with Carti, which lasted for all of six minutes, upset at least one viewer:21 Savage. Ross visibly handed Carti a big bag of money during the short stream, which shocked the American Dream hitmaker.
He confronted the streamer soon after on a phone call and asked: “$2 million, bro?!”

Ross, however, denied that was the full amount that Carti was paid, but that didn’t stop the British-born rapper from continuing with: “Why the fuck you ain’t pay me, bro? That’s crazy, bro. I ain’t gonna lie, bro, that’s fucked up, bro.”
When he continued to deny that Carti was paid for his appearance, the “No Heart” rapper countered: “I just seen you give him a bag of cash.”

Despite the drama, it has since been confirmed that the “Sky” rapper will be returning to Ross’ channel after all.
Earlier this month, Adin took to X to post a photo of himself on FaceTime with Carti. The streamer promised that all the questions people had would be answered soon: “Stream soon. Part 2, the right way for the fans… all questions will be answered.”
