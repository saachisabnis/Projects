The Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium was overflowing with VIPs, including Jonathan Van Ness, Nicola Coughlan and, oh yeah, the actual Royal Family.
Taylor Swift is continuing her path of world domination on The Eras Tour and earlier in June she arrived in London, complete with the iconic three+ hour set list, support from boyfriend Travis Kelce ‚Äì¬†who actually performed with her on Sunday night ‚Äì and of course a star-studded VIP tent.
Over the past week in London, A-list guests included Tom Cruise, Hugh Grant ‚Äì who had an adorable message for Tay post-show ‚Äì Cate Blanchett, Paul McCartney and Bridgerton‚Äôs Nicola Coughlan who was seen dancing with with model Cara Delevingne and Queer Eye‚Äôs Jonathan Van Ness.
Phoebe-Waller Bridge and Andrew Scott were captured being absolutely every single one of us, running back to their spot as they heard the ‚ÄòStyle‚Äô intro just as they left the tent.
Taylor‚Äôs British bestie Sophie Turner was also in the VIP tent, weeks after Sophie branded the pop star a ‚Äòhero‚Äô for supporting her through her divorce from Joe Jonas.
Tay also proved she has no bad blood with ex Tom Hiddleton, whose fianc√©e Zawe Ashton attended the concert with Sophie.
Dear @taylorswift13 , You have an incredible show, an amazing and v hospitable team and excellent if gigantic boyfriend (#tequilashots.). Thanks so much from one ageing London boy, wife and thrilled 8 year old #halfgirlhalfbracelet
Ellie Goulding, Ruby Stokes and Bon Jovi were also spotted in the crowd, as well as Gracie Abrams who performed with Taylor on night 3 of the Eras Tour in London where they sang their collaboration ‚ÄòUs‚Äô, which features on Gracie‚Äôs latest album.
Taylor said their song was written one night when they were hanging out, drinking wine and talking about Ambrans life, adding: ‚ÄúAnd talking about your life became this song,‚Äù before she played guitar while Abrams played piano.

Adorably, Travis‚Äô brother Jason and his wife Kylie also attended the London shows, not once but twice!
The most VIP guests of them all however was Prince William and his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who even joined Taylor backstage for a selfie. She captioned it: ‚ÄúHappy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start.‚Äù
Rachel Zegler, Liam Hemsworth, Jamie Dornan, Greta Gerwig, Mila Kunis and husband Ashton Kutcher were also seen in the crowd, as well as Beth Mead, Talia Mar, Vivianne Miedema and author Holly Jackson.
