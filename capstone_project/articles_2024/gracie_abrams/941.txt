Taylor Swift celebrated her six Grammy nominations for The Tortured Poets Department in the middle of her latest Eras Tour concert, thanking fans for their support.
“You guys did something so amazing over the course of the last few months [with] what you did with embracing Tortured Poets Department,” Swift, 34, said during the acoustic section of her Thursday, November 14, performance at Toronto’s Rogers Centre. “It’s truly blown my mind.”
She continued, “It’s really emotional for me because this album; I wrote it during the Eras Tour. I wrote the album, made the album — all trying to keep it a secret from you guys and then announced the album and was, basically, working really hard to secretly put together a new chapter in the Eras Tour of Tortured Poets Department and we wanted to surprise you with it.”
TTPD is Swift’s 11th studio album, which was released in April one year after the launch of her Eras Tour shows. Last week, Swift earned multiple Grammy nominations for the record and an additional nod for her “Us.” duet with Eras opener Gracie Abrams.
“You guys have just been so wonderful about digging into this album and just really understanding where I was coming from and you made it, by far, the greatest debut week I’ve ever had with an album,” Swift gushed on Thursday of her fans. “You kept that album at No. 1 for nearly four months and most recently what you did — because everything that happens is a direct reflection of the passion you show — is you guys got this album nominated for six Grammys!”
The pop star added, “It’s so wonderful, so thank you.”
Swift is already a 14-time Grammy winner, even taking home the coveted Album of the Year award four times. The 2024 ceremony, which was held earlier this year in February, is where she first announced TTPD.
