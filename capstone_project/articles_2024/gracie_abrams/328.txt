	With one disc powered by his signature corridos and the second packed with hard-hitting trap and hip-hop songs, Peso’s 24-track Éxodo showcases the Mexican star’s duality and versatility. The star-studded project features guest appearances by Cardi B (“Put Em in the Fridge”), Quavo (“Pa No Pensar”) and Rich the Kid (“Gimme a Second”), among many others.

Éxodo follows Peso’s massive year in 2023, which included the release of his history-making Génesis. The album debuted and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart, earning the highest ranking for a Mexican music album on the tally. Earlier this year, the set won the Grammy for best música mexicana album (including tejano).

	Peso Pluma, Billboard‘s 2023 Rookie of the Year, catapulted to stardom last year placing more than 20 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in a span of months. The hitmaker is currently on his Éxodo Tour, which includes upcoming stops in Miami, Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta.

	Trailing behind Éxodo on this week’s poll is Post Malone and Blake Shelton’s “Pour Me a Drink,” with 17% of the vote. The party song is the latest track from Malone’s forthcoming country album, F-1 Trillion.
