Taylor Swift is "swooning" over her boyfriend Travis Kelce's onstage cameo during her June 23 performances at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kansas City Chiefs tight end looked dapper in a black suit and top hat when he popped onstage alongside Swift and several dancers during her performance of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart."
The "Karma" singer celebrated her first "round" of shows at Wembley in a June 24 Instagram message, writing, "Wembley Stadium round one was so surreal. Looking out into crowds of 90,000 fans each night and hearing that VOLUME…Those were some of the loudest crowds I’ve ever heard."
She gushed of Kelce's cameo, writing, "I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tour debut 🥰."
Swift also shared how happy she was to perform with both Hayley Williams and Gracie Abrams at Wembley.
"Acoustic sections went OFF. I got to sing ‘Castles Crumbling’ with @yelyahwilliams for the first time — hadn’t performed with her since 2011 and man my heart was just so full of love for her and our friendship," she wrote. "Then the impossibly gifted and wonderful @gracieabrams came and surprised the crowd with the first performance of our song ‘us.’"
"Never going to forget these shows. Can’t wait to do it 5 more times in August. Up next: Dublin!!" concluded Swift, whose record-breaking "Eras Tour" now moves on to Ireland.
Kelce's appearance was met with cheers from audience members on June 23.
The NFL star played one of Swift's gentleman handlers during a musical interlude in the show. 
After walking on stage, Kelce picked up Swift and carried her to more cheers from the audience. He and Swift's dancers performed a pantomime routine that showed them preparing the singer to continue her performance. 
Swift's official X account tweeted news of his appearance, writing, “TRAVIS KELCE HAS OFFICIALLY MADE HIS #TSTheErasTour DEBUT IN #LondonTSTheErasTour!”
The three-time Super Bowl champion also attended the first two of Swift's three consecutive Wembley concerts. He was accompanied by his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce, and sister-in-law Kylie Kelce. 
After Swift's first Wembley performance, she shared a selfie on Instagram that showed her and Kelce posing with Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
In her caption, Swift acknowledged Prince William's June 21 birthday.
“Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start,” she wrote, adding both British and American flags emoji.
Swift is scheduled to return to Wembley Stadium for five more concerts in August.
