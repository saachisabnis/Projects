Gracie Abrams just spilled the beans about Travis Kelce's surprise onstage appearance during Taylor Swift's concert at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday, June 23.
While visiting SiriusXM's The Morning Mash Up on Tuesday, July 2, Abrams shared her behind-the-scenes experience touring with the singer and some of her interactions with Swift's boyfriend, Kelce – the Kansas City Chiefs' tight end – before his cameo.
"Before we both went on, we were in the tent and he was like — he went on right before I did like, I think two songs or something. He's like, 'I'll mess up so you look really good,'" Abrams recalled on the show, referring to her performance of "Us" with the pop star that night.
Even though Kelce, 34, nailed his viral moment on stage – as Swifties went feral for his surprise appearance – Abrams, 24, went on to give another stellar performance on stage with 34-year-old Swift.
"The thing is, is it's just a community of really supportive people," she recalled on the show about the Eras Tour. "Truly, everyone, whether you're in the tent or in the top row in the stadium, it's like everyone is there because there is such deep joy and feeling associated with all of the music that she's put out over the past 18 years and it's like, I don't know. It's a really magical thing," she stated to the morning show.
Abrams recently shared a video revealing a dramatic yet amusing moment from her songwriting process with the "Bad Blood" singer. The footage, which she posted on Friday, June 21, showed how the pair tackled a small apartment fire. In the video, Swift is holding a small fire extinguisher, visibly confused as she tries to put out the fire. "Wait, what do I do about this?" she asked while struggling to remove the protective pin. Abrams laughed while instructing her friend on what to do, warning, "Not water! This happened ... this happened to me."
After the flames subsided, Swift surveyed the aftermath and noted, "Our purses are ruined. And my shoes. And the whole room, I think." Abrams tried to lighten the mood, laughing and saying, "It smells really good though."
