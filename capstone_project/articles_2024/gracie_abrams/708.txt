If you spent Black Friday flipping through vinyls at your local indie record store, chances are you went home with albums by Noah Kahan and Billie Eilish.
Kahan had the top-selling Record Store Day Black Friday 2024 release, according to Billboard. His Town Hall (Stick Season Collaborations) on tiger eye brown vinyl collected all eight duets from his album Stick Season (We’ll All Be Here Forever), which included collabs with Hozier, Gracie Abrams, Post Malone and Kacey Musgraves.
Eilish had the #2 release: A version of her new album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with just the vocals isolated. 
Other popular vinyl releases this year were U2‘s reimagining of their 2004 album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, called How to Re-Assemble an Atomic Bomb; Rage Against the Machine‘s Democratic National Convention 2000 live album; and releases by the Grateful Dead, The Doors, the Ramones, Van Halen and The Rolling Stones.
