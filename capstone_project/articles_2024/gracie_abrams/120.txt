The 66th Annual Grammy Awards are airing tonight, and music lovers around the world are excited to see all of the incredible stars that will be on hand to celebrate the biggest night in music.
One of the brightest stars of the last year was, of course, Taylor Swift. Nominated for six Grammys, including Album of the Year for her work on her 2022 album Midnights, Taylor is expected to make an appearance of some kind at tonight’s show—though she will not be performing due to scheduling conflicts, as her mega-popular Eras Tour heads back out on the road this coming week, kicking off with four consecutive shows in Japan.
However, Taylor’s name began trending on X long before a single celebrity stepped foot on the red carpet after her eagle-eyed fans noticed the singer’s official website was mysteriously down:

But it’s important to note that her official site didn’t display a typical error message, instead showing an odd mix of letters and numbers:
Swifties immediately assumed this wasn’t a simple case of a popular website being down, but that this was some kind of Easter egg—something the singer is known for among her die-hard fans—and was likely Taylor’s way of announcing the latest re-record for her album Reputation.
For those not in the know, Taylor has been steadily re-recording all of her older albums in a bid to regain ownership over her masters with Reputation and her self-titled debut, Taylor Swift, being the only two albums left in need of the redo treatment.
Naturally, this led Swifties to quickly begin putting the pieces together, with one Swiftie even going so far as to source the code on the site and post their findings:
And—if that weren’t confirmation enough that some shenanigans are definitely going on—”Taylor Nation,” Taylor’s official fan page, liked the above tweet, causing further chaos in the fandom:

Heck, the tweeting got so intense, red carpet correspondents at the Grammys even asked Gracie Abrams—who opened for Taylor during several dates on the Eras Tour—if she knew what might be up (but she kept a very tight lip on the whole ordeal):
Needless to say, Swifties have been losing their minds for the last several hours and are coming through with some absolutely hilarious reactions:

Though, for the record, the site is now back online after being down for a little over an hour:
So whether or not the singer actually plans to make an announcement tonight remains to be seen, but be sure to tune into the 66th Annual Grammy Awards when they air tonight to find out!
