Gracie Abrams, who he's been romantically linked with, has been one of Swift's support acts on the tour
Paul Mescal was seen at Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras’ tour show in Miami, Florida last night (October 20).
The actor was in attendance to watch his reported girlfriend, Gracie Abrams, during her opening set at the concert at Hard Rock Stadium. He was seen watching from one of the private VIP sections.
A number of social media accounts posted footage of Mescal at the concert, while others made reference to his ex-fiancée Phoebe Bridgers, who supported Swift on the tour for a few dates last year, with one saying, “Paul Mescal finally making it to the VIP tent two ‘Eras’ tour opener girlfriends later.”
Another joked, “Guys how funny is it that when ‘Eras’ was first announced people were like omg Paul Mescal First Lady of the ‘Eras’ tour and now ‘Eras’ is ending and he IS First Lady of the ‘Eras’ tour but with a different girlfriend.”

Earlier this month, Mescal was seen at Radio City Music Hall for Abrams’ headline show – the pair have been romantically linked since June this year, when they were seen dining together in London.
Also on Sunday, Mescal attended the Academy Museum Gala, where he was given the Vantage Award. Also honoured at the event, which raised over $11million to support the exhibitions, education initiatives and programming at the museum, were Rita Moreno and Quentin Tarantino.
The Academy Wrote on X/Twitter: “Paul Mescal is a force of nature, redefining what it means to be a true artist in today’s cinematic world. This year, we are proud to honor him with the prestigious Vantage Award at the Academy Museum Gala, a testament to his extraordinary talent and fearless approach to storytelling. His ability to bring fresh, raw perspectives to the screen is unmatched, making him one of the most exciting and transformative actors of his generation.”

Mescal stars in Gladiator II, which is set for cinema release on November 15 in the UK and November 2022 in the US, and he said at a screening and Q&A on Friday night (October 18): “I think it’s made by the only man who could ever touch it, in Ridley Scott, and personally, as his friend and his long admirer, I think it’s one of his finest pieces of work that I’ve seen in recent times. I’m so utterly proud of his work, my work, and everybody sitting here and everybody who’s not sitting here. I don’t think anybody can take that away from us.”
