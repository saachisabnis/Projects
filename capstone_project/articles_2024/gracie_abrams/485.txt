	The Harris-Walz campaign will continue to rock this week with another campaign event featuring prominent musical guests. According to an announcement for the When We Vote We Win event in Madison, Wisc., on Wednesday (Oct. 30) evening, it will feature Democratic presidential candidate current VP Kamala Harris, as well as appearances from Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf, Mumford & Sons and the National singer Matt Berninger and guitarist Aaron Dessner.

	At press time the location of the 5:30-9 p.m. rally in the capital of the crucial swing stage had not yet been revealed. Attendees have to RSVP for the event, though that does not guarantee admission. 

	










	“HEY WISCONSIN! See you Wednesday @kamalaharris @thenational @aarondessner @marcusmumford @mumfordandsons @remiwolf 💙LET’S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” wrote former Eras Tour opening act Abrams, whose new The Secret of Us album featured production and songwriting by Dessner.

	The artists join an increasingly lengthy list of musicians who’ve thrown their support behind Harris’ campaign against convicted felon Donald Trump in what pundits say is still a too-close-to-call race. The latest pledges of support came from a quartet of Puerto Rican superstars — Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi — who all boosted a message of support for Puerto Rico from Harris after a comedian at a New York Trump rally on Sunday referred to P.R. as a “floating island of garbage.” 

	While Trump’s New York rally at Madison Square Garden in deep blue Manhattan featured guests such as vaccine denier and former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr., fired Fox News talking head Tucker Carlson, country singer Lee Greenwood, House Speaker Mike Johnson, X owner Elon Musk, UFC CEO Dana White and live painter Scott Lobaido, Harris has been joined by a parade of A-list supporters in the waning weeks of the contentious White House race.

Beyoncé took the stage alongside former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland at a Harris rally in Houston on Friday night — where the 32-time Grammy winner endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket — while Bruce Springsteen gave his support during an acoustic mini-set for 20,000 people at a Harris event in Clarkston, Ga., on Thursday. Earlier in the week, Eminem encouraged fans to get out and vote for Harris before introducing former two-term President Barack Obama, who rapped a bit of Marshall’s Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 “Lose Yourself.”
