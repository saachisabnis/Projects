Role Model didn’t hold back his frustration with People magazine and fans after learning that Harry Styles had been named the “Sexiest Musician Alive” for 2024. Waking up to the news that he’d landed as the runner-up, the artist, born Tucker Pillsbury, shared his candidly ruthless opinion about the ranking.
Ahead of its Sexiest Man Alive reveal on November 12, People announced last Wednesday (October 30) the results of its hotly contested readers’ choice poll.
Nearly 350,000 votes were cast in the poll this year, which included some very dedicated campaigning on the parts of nominees including Role Model, People reported.
In September, People put forward 15 categories, from “Sexiest Musician” to “Sexiest Supportive Partner in Sports,” for its readers.

At the time, Role Model promoted himself as much as he could. Taking to People’s official TikTok page on September 24, the 27-year-old announced: “So People magazine has asked me to give three reasons why I should be nominated Sexiest Musician Alive. 
“I don’t have three reasons. I have more of a pitch. I’ll beg, if you will. Let’s put it this way. We love an underdog story, right?
“We love the movies where the underdog comes out on top and a happy ending for them, right? They deserve it.

“The three artists that I’m going up against, Mr. Harry Styles, Zach Bryan, and Shaboozey, I love them, right?
“But they have everything. Some have radio hits, some have Grammys, some have clothing brands, and all of them have money. Okay?
“I have nothing. I am nothing. I am the underdog that needs a happy ending. Okay, I just think it would be a beautiful moment.

“Put yourself in my shoes. Right? Let’s vote for me. I beg. I need this more than a Grammy. I need this more than I need food and shelter. 
“I’ve offered to pay People magazine, but they won’t take my money, so just vote.”
The singer continued to campaign for the title, even while touring with Gracie Abrams. On October 11, Role Model shared a snap on his Instagram page showcasing his fans at one of his concerts holding up a sign that read: “We voted you sexiest man alive.”
But all hopes went bust when on October 29, Role Model woke up to the news that former One Direction star and Grammy Awards winner Harry Styles had taken the title for Sexiest Musician Alive.
Taking to his Instagram page, Role Model said in a story: “So this is my speech. Harry Styles has won ‘Sexiest Musician Alive.’ 
“I was the runner-up. I heard about the counts — a lot of you voted for me. But I wanna speak to those who voted for Harry Styles: I hope you’re happy.”

He continued: “I hope your day is made from this, because guess what? His publicist isn’t even going to mention this to him. 
“He won’t know about this. That boy is in Fiji, somewhere. That’s how insignificant this is to him. His publicist won’t even mention it to him. So I hope you’re happy.”
The Blind hitmaker concluded: “And to People magazine — I’m treading lightly here — you had an opportunity to really do something for the culture.”

“To create this beautiful ending to an underdog story. And you didn’t.”
Role Model went on to pair his “speech” with two more Instagram stories, Buzzfeed reported on October 29.
The first was a screenshot of People‘s article, supposedly making fun of text referring to a photo that says “Role Model (top).”

The second was a selfie of him in the car with Clairo’s song Sexy to Someone playing in the background. 
The Maine, USA, native was seemingly still feeling frustration over the disappointing results over the weekend, as on Sunday (November 3), he shared two follow-up stories reflecting on the issue.
In the first story, a woman appeared to be dressed up as him, sporting a white T-shirt that read: “Nominated sexiest man alive.”

The second picture shared was a meme which displayed a question that read: “Do you have any enemies” to which the answer showed: “Yea Harry.”
At the time of writing, Harry hasn’t posted any reactions to winning the title.
Bored Panda has contacted Harry’s representatives for comment.

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.

Sexy???? I don't see what others see, apparently, as neither should win that title.
Yeah, this is definitely a to each their own type deal. I guess on the plus side it's nice to see that they didn't just go for the traditionally steroetype of attractive and seem to have looked deeper into their personality. In the case of Harry, at least. I don't know, I never agree with any of the results to these types of things except when Paul Rudd won sexist man. Otherwise, I guess I just have a different taste in men 🤷🏼‍♀️
