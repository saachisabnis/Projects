PINE BELT, Miss. (WDAM) - The former star quarterback returned to his stomping grounds Wednesday in a surprise presidential campaign endorsement.
Brett Favre appeared alongside former U.S. President Donald Trump at a Republican rally in Green Bay, WI. 
Wisconsin is a critical battleground state that Trump narrowly won in 2016 but then narrowly lost in 2020. It is also the home of Favre’s former NFL team, the Green Bay Packers, where he won the 1997 Super Bowl and three NFL Most Valuable Player awards.
Favre tapped into that winning record for his endorsement of Trump.
“Much like the Packer organization, Donald Trump and his organization is a winner, and the United States of America won with his leadership,” Favre said.
In his speech, Favre said this was his first time to make a presidential endorsement. He explained that he felt the stakes were “incredibly high” this election, so he decided to speak out. Favre specifically mentioned his main concerns: inflation, stagnated wages, the cost of housing, the drug epidemic, and rising tensions overseas. 
Favre said he believed Trump was the best choice to address these concerns.
“We‘ve already had President Trump once,” said Favre. “We‘ve already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know which is better.... So, it’s time to bench Kamala and put in the star quarterback, Donald Trump.” 
Also on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris held a “When We Vote, We Win” rally in Madison, WI. That rally featured musical guests Mumford & Sons and Gracie Abrams. 
The Harris-Walz campaign said it is focused on motivating nontraditional and young voters to vote on election day.
