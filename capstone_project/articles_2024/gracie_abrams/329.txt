The nine members of The World-Herald's 2024 All State Academic Team aspire to make the world a better place through their future careers. 
This year's scholars see themselves working toward a cure for cancer, addressing health inequities and utilizing the power of technology through their professions. 
Two of the nine scholars will stay in Nebraska for college, while others will head to Los Angeles, New York or Baltimore.
Multiple scholars have earned full-ride scholarships, including two who will take advantage of the new Presidential Scholars program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The scholarship covers the full cost of tuition plus an additional stipend for Nebraska students who earn a perfect ACT score of 36 and attend one of the University of Nebraska campuses. 
When they weren't busy working toward their academic success, this year's scholars said they liked to unwind through hobbies such as sports, music, baking and sewing.
While they're excited for their next journey, several scholars said they will miss the relationships they built with fellow students and teachers at their high schools. 
Millard North's Arjun Anugole
Millard North: no rank out of 548; 35 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Salmohan Anugole and Snehlata Gupta
College, planned degree: UCLA; biochemistry and public health
Scholarships: National Merit; UNL regents, career; UNMC Travis B. Lewis; Millard Public Schools Foundation Scholarship of Excellence; Rotary Club Honor Roll
Why did you pick your college?
I picked UCLA because it's a premier research institution with an emphasis on biological sciences. I also love the city of L.A. because of the weather and all there is to do. And, of course, UCLA has the No. 1 dining hall in the nation. 
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
I hope to be working in medicine, providing health care to underserved communities while also researching to inform health policy so that I can help combat global health inequities. 
Surprising fact about you?
I am a black belt in martial arts and have trained with bo staff, sai and escrima sticks. 
Favorite way to de-stress?
My favorite way to de-stress is by staying active and playing sports like tennis, pickleball, spikeball or cricket. 
Favorite snack?
My favorite snack is probably jalapeño chips.
What superpower would you choose? 
I would probably pick super speed so that I would never be late for anything. 
What will you miss most about high school?
I am really going to miss the memories that I made on the tennis team and just eating lunch with my friends. 
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Live in the moment and don't worry too much about your future because everyone will end up where they are meant to. Also, try to get involved, because clubs, activities and sports can help you find your passion.
Creighton Prep's Mark Bausch
Omaha Creighton Prep: no rank out of 211; 36 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Ann Marie Bausch and Trenten Bausch
College, planned degree: Notre Dame; neuroscience
Scholarships: National Merit; University of Notre Dame Stamps; Fordham National Merit; UNL regents, career, president’s; St. Louis University vice president’s; Santa Clara Bronco, Dean’s; Creighton Prep Presidential, Cassem Memorial; Coolidge Scholarship Senator; Academic Decathlon; Burger King 
Why did you pick your college?
I chose to go to Notre Dame because of the unparalleled academic and research opportunities it will offer me through the Stamps Scholars Program. Further, its Catholic identity is evident in its mission of making the world a better place. The alumni network is peerless and being a dominant sports school that’s managed to stay out of the conference realignment chaos doesn’t hurt either.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
By that time, I hope to be an M.D./Ph.D. working in clinical research making progress on finding cures for cancer. I’d also love to be married with kids.
Surprising fact about you?
I have a Lego resale company that’s surprisingly lucrative. I once sold a single minifigure for over $250.
Favorite way to de-stress?
I’ve played the drum set since fifth grade, so whenever I’m stressed out about a big test or project, I always grab a pair of headphones and drumsticks and head to the kit to play along to some Foo Fighters or Nirvana.
Favorite snack?
Nothing beats a late-night buffalo chicken quesadilla, whether it’s at home or Taco Bell.
What superpower would you choose? 
I’ve always thought the ability to heal would be super cool. Like the Midas touch, but instead of the person turning into gold, any illness they have would be healed. The only downside is I would have to pick a different career path.
What will you miss most about high school?
I’ll definitely miss my friends the most. The Prep brotherhood is truly a real thing, and the guys I’ve met and cultivated relationships with will continue to be some of my best friends throughout my life.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Don’t be afraid to ask teachers for help. Put your ego aside because they definitely know more than you do. Once you’ve mastered the topic, pay it forward by helping other kids that might be struggling with that same concept.
Pender's Caleb Kelly
Pender: no rank out of 27; 36 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Jeff and Melissa Kelly
College, planned degree: UNL; computer sciences and physics
Scholarships: National Merit; UNL president's 
Why did you pick your college?
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln aligns with my career goals and also allows me to stay relatively close to my family. Additionally, the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management is a renowned program I believe will help me become the best I can be.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
In 20 years, I hope to either be involved in research or running my own company. Though I haven’t yet decided on the career path I want to pursue, real human impact is a must. I want to make a difference in people’s lives.
Surprising fact about you?
I know how to ride horses. Every summer, I have shown horses in a county fair where my grandparents live. It’s a family tradition.
Favorite way to de-stress?
My favorite way to de-stress is baking. It’s one of my favorite hobbies. To me, baking is an art because I can incorporate techniques with personal variations to make a masterpiece both visually and in the form of taste and texture. I bake everything from chocolate chip cookies to mille feuille pastries.
Favorite snack?
My favorite snack is chocolate chip cookies — I’ve perfected my recipe over the course of four years. Though I am known for my cookie-crunching habits, I enjoy a wide variety of desserts. However, I tend to value quality over quantity — homemade sweets are a must.
What superpower would you choose? 
If I could have any superpower, it would be to multiply myself. I have so many interests that it’s difficult for me to balance them all. This way, I could be in more than one place at once.
What will you miss most about high school?
My high school is small. I think I will miss all the connections I have made throughout my time here. I know all of the teachers, faculty, staff and students by name. I have a place in high school — a defined role that I fill. Leaving high school will mean letting go of a major component of my identity; however, I hope to discover more about myself in the journey ahead.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
My biggest piece of advice for incoming freshmen is to keep pushing boundaries. Just because someone tells you something is impossible does not mean it really is — there is always an exception. If you work hard enough, doors will open for you.
Omaha Duchesne's Rachel Fernandes
Omaha Duchesne: no rank out of 86; 36 ACT, 1560 SAT, National Merit
Parents: Sharmila Braganza and Praveen Fernandes
College, planned degree: Johns Hopkins; chemistry major
Scholarships: UNL president's; UNO president's; Creighton Magis, Roman Shaffel; University of Tulsa National Merit Semifinalist; Fordham University Fordham; University of Pittsburgh
Why did you pick your college?
Johns Hopkins has been my dream school for the last few years. In terms of academics, Hopkins is an amazing school for the sciences, and it has great resources for pre-medical students. Plus, I plan on minoring in music, and it has a world-renowned music school where I’ll be able to continue my piano studies. When I visited last year, I immediately fell in love with the beautiful campus, the atmosphere and the community, so I decided to apply Early Decision. I’m so excited to start school in the fall and be surrounded by such a diverse and talented student body.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
In 20 years, I see myself working as a doctor and using my education and skills to make an impact on others' lives and my community.
Surprising fact about you?
I love being crafty, and I make earrings, jewelry, collages and sew in my free time. I’m definitely a very artsy person as I’m also involved with a cappella choir, theater, handbell choir and piano.
Favorite way to de-stress?
I usually de-stress by listening to music, sleeping or playing the piano. Some of my favorite artists are Lana Del Rey, Conan Gray, Ethel Cain, Gracie Abrams and Phoebe Bridgers. I also love listening to classical music.
Favorite snack?
I absolutely love snacking on fruits, especially any type of berry. I can easily demolish a box of blueberries or raspberries in one sitting.
What superpower would you choose? 
If I could have any superpower, I would want the ability to teleport. Being able to go wherever I want in the blink of an eye would definitely make life a lot easier and keep things new and exciting. 
What will you miss most about high school?
I’ll miss the amazing community at Duchesne, as well as all the relationships that I’ve built with my friends, classmates and teachers over the last four years.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
My biggest advice for incoming freshmen is to be open to trying new things and taking on challenges. Don’t be afraid to push yourself. You’ll never know your full potential unless you give everything your all. Also, don’t let failures or setbacks discourage you from pursuing your passions!
Lincoln Southeast's Lillias McKillip
Lincoln Southeast: no rank out of 485; 36 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Jessica and Austin McKillip
College, planned degree: UNL; elementary education and Spanish
Scholarships: UNL president's; Delta Kappa Gamma International Zeta Chapter
Why did you pick your college?
I will be attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the fall, studying elementary education and Spanish. I’ve always enjoyed the experiences I’ve had at UNL activities throughout my time in Lincoln. I’m excited for the excellent programs UNL offers and to attend college completely free through the presidential scholarship program.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
I plan to work in the field of education in an administrative role incorporating Spanish or curriculum development.
Surprising fact about you?
I love spending time outside, especially hiking. I went on a backpacking trip for five days in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness in Colorado.
Favorite way to de-stress?
Playing the cello or piano can take my mind off of nearly any stressful situation. After I’ve played a couple songs, I’m much more focused and mentally prepared to return to a stressful project.
Favorite snack?
I like mixing Colby Ridge popcorn with dried cranberries. It’s delicious.
What superpower would you choose? 
I would love to be able to touch any instrument and know how to play it instantly. There are so many really cool and unique instruments, like a hurdy-gurdy or bagpipes, but I don’t have the time to learn them all. 
What will you miss most about high school?
I will miss the amazing students and teachers at Lincoln Southeast, especially my teammates and coaches on the speech team.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Get involved with several activities right away. You won’t know if you’ll enjoy an activity or connect with the people involved in it until you’ve tried it out.
Creighton Prep's Cooper Morris
Omaha Creighton Prep: no rank out of 211; 35 ACT, 1590 SAT, National Merit
Parents: Jennifer Morris, Jeffery Morris
College, planned degree: Columbia; neuroscience
Scholarships: National Merit
Why did you pick your college?
Columbia is in New York City, which means I can get to places without driving, and I enjoy heavily metropolitan environments. Furthermore, Columbia’s "Core Curriculum" not only has exciting courses, but also will prevent me from my otherwise inevitable habit of signing up only for math and science classes. Lastly, Columbia places significant emphasis on undergraduate research, which I intend to start as soon as possible.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
Admittedly, it could be as a neurosurgeon, a neuroscientist or any occupation that allows me to directly help people or advance scientific understanding of the world. I would preferably be in either an exceptionally urban city or in Norway.
Surprising fact about you?
I have a permanent supply of pencils and assorted rainbow colored pens on me at all times.
Favorite way to de-stress?
The perfect scenario is having headphones blasting some Hollow Knight soundtrack while drinking a latte and doing sudoku.
Favorite snack?
Toast with some sort of hazelnut spread.
What superpower would you choose? 
I have to go with teleportation. I would no longer have any travel costs, my ETA would always be zero seconds, and — as an added bonus — I would effectively have free access to enter the International Space Station whenever I want. 
What will you miss most about high school?
It will be hard to predict what I am taking for granted before I lose it, but I can only imagine not having to do my taxes will be pretty high on that list.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
You typically get out of your classes some amount proportional to what you put in, but especially if you enjoy the class. Hence, in particular, I would suggest taking electives that appear interesting and turning them into passion projects.
Millard North's Advika Namasivayam
Millard North: no rank out of 548; 36 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Namasivayam Somasundaram and Suganya Ulaganathan
College, planned degree: MIT; computer science
Scholarships: National Merit; National Honor Society; Millard Public Schools Foundation North Middle School; P.E.O. STAR

I have memorized over 100 digits of pi.
Favorite way to de-stress?
I enjoy both listening to and making music. It lets my mind wander and explore infinite possibilities.
Favorite snack?
Honey Bunches of Oats. Without milk. The diverse textures and flavors intrigue me. You never know what you’ll get next. The feel of smooth almonds? Or the taste of sweet crunchiness?
What superpower would you choose? 
I would like to have the ability to add time to my day. There are always days here and there when I wish I could have even just one more hour, whether that be to learn, relax or sleep.
What will you miss most about high school?
For sure the people. I’ll miss all the great friends I’ve made and the teachers who have shaped me into who I am today. 
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Don’t stop doing what you love. If you find anything even remotely interesting, learn more about it. You never know when you might find your passion. 
Elkhorn South's Rachel Wu
Elkhorn South: 2 out of 317; 36 ACT, National Merit
Parents: Ming Hua Wang, Terry Brown
College, planned degree: Duke; biomedical engineering
Scholarships: National Merit; UNL president's; University of Rochester Rush Rhees; Boston University presidential; Texas A&M president's, Brown Foundation; University of Washington Purple and Gold; Duke Kunshan University (China) Merit; Elkhorn Foundation Achieve; Conagra Brands Foundation Scholarship
Why did you pick your college?
I’ll be attending Duke University in the fall. I chose this university because it has one of the top biomedical engineering programs in the country, yet I'll also have a lot of freedom to explore my academic interests beyond just engineering, which is helpful for someone like me who isn’t 100% sure about what they want to do. Plus, the campus is beautiful, and I love the school spirit. I’m not a basketball fan, but I’m still definitely looking forward to games.
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
I see myself hopefully working in biotechnology either in patent law, as a bioinformatics scientist researching new ways to fight disease or new immunotherapies, or as a professor teaching and doing research in biotech for a university. I also hope to be living in a cool mid-century modern house — if my dreams come true, maybe it's even a Frank Lloyd Wright house.
Surprising fact about you?
I got really into fantasy football for a couple of months in junior year when my friends started a league. Unfortunately, my star players got injured, but I ultimately finished third.
Favorite way to de-stress?
I love to hang out with my friends and go outside. When the weather is nice, an outing to the park always manages to improve my mood. Music is also one of my favorite stress relievers, I'll sometimes just play some music and zone out.
Favorite snack?
Anything green tea/matcha flavored, especially pastries with strawberries, too.
What superpower would you choose? 
I think any time-related power like stopping time or rewinding would be very nice. Besides more hours in a day to do fun things (or take more naps), it would also be handy for when I make a silly mistake and want a do-over.
What will you miss most about high school?
I will definitely miss my friends and the shared experiences we’ve had the most. There are a lot of things in high school I likely won’t get to continue on with, like marching band, but the memories I’ve made are ones I’ll cherish forever.
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Don’t be afraid to just chase after what you want. I sometimes wish I had more courage earlier to try new activities that I ended up loving, but overall I’m glad I did what I loved without compromise for the most part! If you have any interest in something, try it, because you never know what awesome things might come out of it.
Lincoln East's Christina Xu
Lincoln East: no rank out of 566; 35 ACT, 1550 SAT, National Merit
Parents: Lisong Xu, Wei Zhang
College, planned degree: Yale; computer science and political science
Scholarships: National Merit 
Why did you pick your college?
When I visited campus, the students and professors were incredibly welcoming and supportive. I love how New York City is nearby along with other big East Coast cities. The multitude of internships, clubs and research opportunities were exactly what I was looking for. Plus, the food in New Haven is 10/10. Boola Boola!
Where do you see yourself in 20 years?
Living in California using technology to improve different industries whether it’s economics or policy.
Surprising fact about you?
During quarantine, I picked up sewing and memorized the sewing machine manual cover to cover.
Favorite way to de-stress?
Walking and hanging out with my goldendoodle. He’s always ready to greet me when I come home and put a smile on my face.
Favorite snack?
Honey roasted peanuts (from Costco of course).
What superpower would you choose? 
Teleportation, so I can travel without costly plane tickets.
What will you miss most about high school?
I will definitely miss seeing the friends I’ve grown up with since elementary school. My teachers have also been a huge part of my life — especially forming special relationships with the advisers of various clubs such as debate, Key Club or Computer Science Club. 
Advice for incoming high school freshmen?
Ask for help. Your teachers, staff and peers want to see you succeed and can give you new perspectives that might change how you view different challenges. Upperclassmen also are a great resource for navigating new territory. Don’t forget to appreciate those who’ve supported you along the way!
A good school can lead to a lifetime of opportunities. Myriad data shows that lifetime earnings dramatically increase with every degree obtained. Bachelor’s degree holders will earn an average of roughly $26,000 more each year than high school graduates. And for those who decide that pursuing a college degree is not the best postsecondary option, a good school will provide students with the tools and support to make that choice, and the foundational skills necessary to succeed in the workforce.
For many families, the school district is a top criteria when deciding where to buy a home. But this consideration and ability to choose is not a luxury all families can afford, especially in today’s wildly competitive housing market.
One important proxy of a quality education is per-student spending. According to the most recent Census data available, the national average per-pupil expenditure in fiscal year 2019 was $13,187. Several recent studies suggest that increased spending per student correlates with higher academic achievement, particularly in districts serving predominantly low-income students. Since public schools are largely funded by property taxes, schools in low-income areas suffer the most from a lack of funding for critical expenditures like staff salaries and benefits, transportation, instructional resources, and support services.
There are more than 13,000 school districts in the U.S., each one slightly different, for better or worse, than the next. However, several common denominators exist and, when compared, can serve as indicators of what makes an impactful district.
Stacker compiled a list of the best school districts in Nebraska using rankings from Niche. Niche ranks school districts based on a variety of criteria including academics (SAT/ACT scores and state proficiency tests), teacher salaries, expenses per student, and access to extracurricular activities.
