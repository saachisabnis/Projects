Taylor Swift is still not over the epic moment Travis Kelce joined her onstage during her Eras Tour stop at Wembley Stadium. On Monday, the pop star celebrated her first round of shows in London with a sweet post dedicated to those who joined her onstage during her weekend set of performances, including  Kelce, who carried her during the Tortured Poets part of her show.

	“I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tour debut 🥰,” wrote Swift on Instagram. “Never going to forget these shows. Can’t wait to do it 5 more times in August.”

	Kelce carried Swift on the stage during the intro to “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” Sunday night. The singer also thanked Gracie Abrams and Hayley Williams, who joined her onstage for surprise songs throughout her set of stops.

	“Wembley Stadium round one was so surreal. Looking out into crowds of 90,000 fans each night and hearing that VOLUME,” she wrote. “Those were some of the loudest crowds I’ve ever heard. Acoustic sections went OFF.”

	










	” I got to sing ‘Castles Crumbling’ with @yelyahwilliams for the first time — hadn’t performed with her since 2011, and man, my heart was just so full of love for her and our friendship,” she wrote. “Then the impossibly gifted and wonderful @gracieabrams came and surprised the crowd with the first performance of our song ‘Us.’”

	Sunday’s 90,000-person crowd also included multiple VIP guests, including Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, Jon Bon Jovi, and Ellie Goulding. On Friday night, Prince William attended with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who snapped a selfie with Swift and Kelce. “Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start,” Swift wrote.

	 Next weekend, Swift heads to Dublin, Ireland. The European and U.K. leg of the tour runs through August before returning to North America for a string of dates that conclude on Dec. 8 at BC Place in Vancouver. Swift also recently announced that she will be wrapping up the Eras Tour for good at the end of 2024.
