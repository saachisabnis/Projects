Sabrina Carpenter has been jokingly arresting audience members before singing fan-favorite song “Juno” at her Short n’ Sweet tour concerts, and Monday was no exception. At her final U.S. tour date in LA, Sabrina arrested none other than Jack Antonoff and his wife, actress Margaret Qualley. Sabrina asked Jack, who produced four songs on Short n’ Sweet, if maybe he “could produce someone even hotter than you.” He obliged by pushing Margaret into frame. “Whoever made you, God bless them, God bless their genetics,” Sabrina told Margaret, referencing lyrics from “Juno.”
Gracie Abrams attended the Gladiator II LA premiere after-party with her rumored boyfriend and the film’s star, Paul Mescal, on Monday. The date night served as the first major public appearance for the couple, who were seen getting cozy together after they posed for photographs.
