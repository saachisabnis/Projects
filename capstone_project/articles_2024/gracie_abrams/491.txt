Taylor Swift is feeling grateful after the return of her Eras Tour, which picked right back up over the weekend after a two-month break with three shows in Miami.

	And following the conclusion of her stay at Hard Rock Stadium, the pop star took to Instagram on Tuesday (Oct. 22) to say thank you to her fans. “The Eras Tour is BACK and the 3 Miami crowds we just got to play for were on a new level,” Swift wrote, sharing a slew of photos from the performances. “With only 5 cities left to play before it’s over, I knew I was going to be savoring every moment up on that stage but the bewildering passion of those crowds really blew my mind.”

	










	“It rained (a lot) the 1st and 3rd nights, and so that kicked up the cinematic drama,” the 14-time Grammy winner continued. “I had really missed this on our break. The mass quantities of joyful people genuinely living in the moment and seeming truly carefree for 3.5 hours.”

	The trio of Eras Tour shows in the Sunshine State was indeed memorable, with rainstorms bookending the dates and Florence Welch — “my mystifyingly talented friend,” as Swift described her — aptly joining the “Anti-Hero” artist on stage each night to sing their The Tortured Poets Department collaboration “Florida!!!” Swift also debuted a new Reputation jumpsuit and several new dresses during the shows, about which she wrote on Instagram, “I got some new outfits, and it’s always nice when the crowd notices that 😁 You guys are just the best.” 

	“Thank you to everyone who came and everyone who followed along online,” she concluded her post. “4 more cities left and the next one up is: New Orleans!”

	As Swift pointed out, the Eras Tour has just a few more stops — NOLA, Indianapolis, Toronto and Vancouver — before it ends in December. The trek first kicked off nearly two years ago in March 2023 and has seen the musician travel through North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia, joined by openers Phoebe Bridgers, Gracie Abrams, Paramore, Sabrina Carpenter and more.

	The entire trek has also seen millions of fans from all over the world come out in droves to get in on the friendship bracelet trading and three-hour-plus scream-singalongs, something Swift highlighted during her first show in Miami. Calling the audience one of the “wildest, most passionate, craziest, most loving crowds in the world,” Swift gushed, “The volume at which you are singing every single one of these songs is astonishing.”
