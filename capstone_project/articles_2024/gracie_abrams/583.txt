(FOX40.COM) — The Grammys took place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and the Sacramento area was well-represented at the 66th annual celebration of musical talent.
Taking home her first-ever Grammy award was Sheldon High School graduate Victoria Monét, who won Best R&B Album for her project, “Jaguar II,” which was released in August of 2023.
To win the award, Monét beat out Babyface (“Girls Night Out”), Coco Jones (“What I Didn’t Tell You Deluxe“), Summer Walker (“Clear 2: Soft Life EP”), and Emily King (“Special Occasion”)

However, that wasn’t Monét’s only win of the night. She also took home the awards for Best Engineered Album (Nonclassical) and Best New Artist. For the former, Monét’s album was chosen over albums from Feist, Boygenius, Bokanté, and Caroline Polacheck. For the latter, she was able to win the award over Gracie Abrams, Fred Again, Ice Spice, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones, and Noah Kahan.
Monét was the second-most nominated artist at the Grammys on Sunday with seven total nominations, which ranked only behind SZA, who had nine.
A fourth Grammy for Best R&B Performance was on the table for Monét, which could have been a special one as her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter was also included in the nomination. But Coco Jones’ “ICU” won the award.
That nomination made Monét’s daughter, named Hazel, the youngest Grammy nominee in the award’s history.
Speaking to PEOPLE on her daughter’s nomination, Monét said, “Pregnancy, it’s going into unknown territory and no one’s story is the same. So, to have one of the more fearful moments career-wise turn into one of the best moments ever of my career is magical. I’m honored to have the accolade for her.”
