MADISON, WI (WTAQ-WRN) – More focus on Wisconsin this week, from the presidential campaigns. 
Wednesday – just six days from Election Day – Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Madison and former President Donald Trump in the Green Bay area. 
Trump is scheduled to host a rally at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon, joined by former Packers quarterback Brett Favre. The Republican candidate’s remarks are scheduled for 6:00 and a campaign advisory suggests he’ll address issues related to the economy, although Trump rarely sticks to one topic. 
Vice-President Harris will be on the University of Wisconsin campus for a Get Out the Vote concert and rally featuring musical artists Gracie Abrams, Mumford and Sons, Remi Wolf and members of The National. The event starts at noon and is scheduled to end by the time Trump takes the stage in Ashwaubenon.
The Democratic nominee for Vice President will be back in Northeast Wisconsin today. Gov. Tim Walz will be in Manitowoc for an event at 10:30 a.m. to encourage supporters to vote early for Democrats, according to the Harris/Walz campaign.
Today is also when Republican VP hopeful JD Vance will be in Racine.
