JANESVILLE, Wis. (WMTV) - The Harris-Walz campaign released details for another Wisconsin stop on Friday, this one in Rock County.
Vice President Kamala Harris will stop at a union hall in Janesville before heading to Appleton, and then Milwaukee.
Details about what time the stop in Janesville is scheduled for, or the exact location have not been confirmed by the campaign.
According to the Rock Co. Historical Society, the last time a Democratic presidential candidate was in Rock Co. was in 2008 when former President Barack Obama visited Janesville.
On Wednesday, Harris held a rally in Madison featuring musical guests like Mumford & Sons, Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf and others.
The rally in Milwaukee will feature Cardi B, GloRilla, Flo Milli and others.
WisGOP Chairman Brian Schimming released a statement ahead of Harris’ visits.
“Lowering inflation, reducing crime, and making rent affordable again are the issues that will decide this election,” Schimming said. “While Democrats delude themselves into thinking Milwaukeeans care one iota about their latest caravan of Hollywood celebrities, President Trump and Republicans are focusing on the needs of working families.”
Former President Donald Trump will also hold a rally Friday night in Milwaukee.
