Gracie Abrams’ sophomore studio album, The Secret of Us, is out now (via Interscope). The follow-up to last year’s Good Riddance includes breakout single “Close to You” and a new song featuring Taylor Swift, “Us.” Hear the latter track below.
Abrams opened for Swift on the Eras Tour in the spring and summer last year. She’ll rejoin the tour for its final dates in the autumn.
Abrams co-produced The Secret of Us with the National’s Aaron Dessner. She co-produced “Us.,” in particular, with Dessner, Jack Antonoff, and Taylor Swift. The track has additional contributions from Rob Moose, Laura Sisk, James McAlister, Jonathan Low, and others.
Gracie Abrams shared The Secret of Us’ lead single, “Risk,” in May, and has found commercial success with “Close to You,” which debuted at No. 49 on the Billboard Hot 100.
