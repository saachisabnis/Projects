Concert promoters offered Taylor Swift fans a last-minute opportunity to attend one of her final Eras Tour shows in Vancouver with one catch — the seats offered no view of the stage.
Ticketmaster dropped “listening-only” tickets on Monday, November 25, that were priced at approximately $15 CAD and a processing fee. The tickets were quickly resold online, per fans.
“They got snatched and listed on resale sites already. I was in the queue and I got booted out saying online sales were done. StubHub last night had around 200 tickets listed for resale and that number has doubled in the last hour,” one fan wrote via X on Monday, alongside a screenshot of the available tickets. Per the map, some of the tickets cost over $1,000.
Swift, 34, is set to perform her final three shows of the Eras Tour in Vancouver’s BC Place stadium on December 6, December 7 and December 8. Ahead of the concert, Swift took to Instagram to reflect on her journey with the tour.
“Our 6 shows in Toronto were so incredible. It was awesome to play in Canada after so much time. As always, the fans in Toronto treated us like it was a hometown show. Couldn’t have asked for more love or generosity from the people who came out. I got to play a mashup of the *Grammy nominated* song ‘us’ with @gracieabrams, mashed up with ‘Out of the Woods’ and I just adore her. She’s been giving the most amazing performances every night on this tour!!” Swift wrote on Tuesday, November 26, gushing over Gracie Abrams.
“The emotions have gotten pretty heightened for me and the rest of the team because it’s gotten extremely real for us: Our next city will be the last one of The Eras Tour, and the closing of the most extraordinary chapter of my life so far,” she continued. “See you 🔜 , Vancouver. We can’t wait to give you all we’ve got for three more shows. 🥲.”

Swift, who has been on tour since March 2023, announced in June that Eras Tour would be wrapping at the end of the year.
“[It’s been] the most exhausting, all-encompassing, but most joyful, most rewarding, most wonderful thing that has ever happened in my life,” Swift said while performing in Liverpool, England, at the time. “I think that this tour has really become my entire life. It’s taken over everything. I think I once had hobbies, but I don’t know what they were anymore. All I do when I’m not on stage is sit at home and try to think of clever acoustic song mash-ups and think about what you might want to hear.”
By the end of the tour’s conclusion, TIME reported that Swift will have played 152 shows across 54 cities around the globe. The outlet reported in March that Swift sold around 6.02 million tickets.
