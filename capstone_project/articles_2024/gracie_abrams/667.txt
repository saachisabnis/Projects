Taylor Swift brought Gracie Abrams out onstage Sunday night during the latest show of Swift’s Eras Tour.

	Abrams, who opened for Swift’s Eras Tour last summer, released her second album, The Secret of Us, on Friday. The album features the track “Us,” a collaboration with Swift.



	Onstage at London’s Wembley Stadium, Swift noted that the song was written one night when the duo were hanging out, drinking wine and talking about Abrams’ life. “And talking about your life became this song,” Swift added.

	Swift played guitar, while Abrams played the piano.

	










	After “Us,” Swift performed a second surprise song — a mashup of “Out of the Woods,” “Is It Over Now?” and “Clean.” The latter three are all featured on the album 1989 (the original and/or the released version).

	On Friday, Abrams posted two videos of the two working together. The second video showed Swift grabbing a fire extinguisher to put out a small kitchen fire.

	“Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life. @taylorswift now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you,” Abrams wrote.

	Abrams previously hit the stage with Swift last summer in Cincinnati, performing her own song “I Miss You, I’m Sorry” with Swift on guitar.
