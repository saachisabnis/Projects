It’s been a long time coming — and this end of an era really has. 
Think back to November 2022, when Taylor Swift announced that she was going on a stadium tour, her first since 2018. Called “The Eras Tour,” the concert is “a journey through the musical eras of my career (past and present!),” Swift said at the time — and it turned out to be the ticket everyone had to have. 
Fans overwhelmed Ticketmaster to a breaking point so distressing that even Congress had to step in. There had been a “historically unprecedented demand,” the company said, and boy, were they right.
Over nearly two years and 149 shows across five continents, “The Eras Tour” broke attendance records, boosted economies and is the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. And this weekend, it came a close with a final show in Vancouver Dec. 8. 
As fans around the world flocked to Canada to see it live or gather at home for watch parties, TODAY took note of every notable moment from the final show, so read along and see how the "Eras Tour" wrapped up its iconic run.  Are you ready for it?

The final "Eras Tour" show was a moving tribute to the record-breaking concert experience phenomenon. But fans hoping for news regarding the highly anticipated rerecording of Swift's sixth studio album "Reputation," may have ended the night disappointed. 
Amy Eley
Taylor Swift ended the "Eras Tour" as she started it, surrounded by her backup performers. 
At the end of "Karma," she had an emotional hug with her dancers and backup vocalists. And instead of her usual final exit, which typically involves her being lowered beneath the stage, she opted to walk out with her team of performers — one last time. 
Amy Eley
As an ode to her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, Swift shouted out "the guy on the Chiefs" during the final performance of "Karma."
The Chiefs beat the Los Angeles Chargers tonight 19-17.
Amy Eley
“I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my life so far,” Swift said before launching into the colorful, glittery performance that is "Karma." It is the final song of the night.
Amy Eley
One of the dancers on the "Eras Tour," Kameron Saunders, gets a number of solo moments during each concert to take the spotlight. 
The final one came tonight when he did his last solo dance during Swift's performance of "Bejeweled." His last move of his solo: blowing a kiss to Swift, at which point the singer ran over to give him a hug.

The final surprise song section of the "Eras Tour" has come and gone, so we can finally run the numbers. 
Out of Swift's 11 albums, there are six songs that were not performed during the "Eras Tour":

As we wipe our tears from the acoustic set (your TODAY.com team is officially destroyed from those mashups), Taylor Swift is starting the "Midnights" era, the last chapter of the night. 
As she said in June, "this tour is going to end in December," and now we are seeing the final bow quickly approaching.
Maddie Ellis
On guitar: "A Place In This World" (from "Taylor Swift") and "New Romantics" (from "1989") mashup.
On piano: "Long Live" (from "Speak Now"), "New Year's Day" (from "Reputation") and "The Manuscript" (from "The Tortured Poets Department") mashup.
Maddie Ellis
After a devastating three song piano mashup, Swift closed her final surprise song section with heartbreaking lyrics from "The Manuscript": 
The only thing that’s left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
Now and then I reread the manuscript
But the story isn’t mine anymore
Maddie Ellis
Somehow making her piano rendition of "Long Live" sadder, Swift added lyrics from "New Year's Day," a song about holding onto memories, and "The Manuscript," about turning heartbreak into purpose through storytelling. 
The mashup combines three distinct eras, "Speak Now," "Reputation" and her most recent album, "The Tortured Poets Department." 
Maddie Ellis
Swift turned "Long Live" into a moving, slow ballad seemingly in honor of the end of "The Eras Tour" and fittingly changed a lyric. 
Instead of, "It was the end of a decade," Swift sang, "It was the end of an era." 
Maddie Ellis
Moving right along to the piano, Swift skipped an introduction and started playing the opening chords of "Long Live." 
The beloved song notably served as the closing credits for "The Eras Tour" concert film. 
Maddie Ellis
Our first mashup on the night combines an OG song with the beloved "1989" hit, "New Romantics," bringing the Taylors from 2006 and 2014 together. 
Maddie Ellis
"A Place In This World"!
Introducing the first surprise song on the guitar, Swift says the acoustic section was meant to "challenge" her to play a variety of songs beyond the setlist.
She said she wanted to "go back to the beginning" for the last surprise song, and fittingly started with a song from her first album. 
Amy Eley
It's worth noting, as seen in the post below, that there was one camera operator on the stage during "Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?" It's not clear why they are filming, but camera operators have been present during the Vancouver shows. Motorized cameras have also been seen along the stage tonight and signs were posted informing attendees that "remote piloted aerial filming" was in progress.
The last time camera crews were extensively onstage, they were filming the concert film "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour." 
The concert film, which premiered in theaters in October 2023, features Swift's performances before she added the "Tortured Poets" era in May.
Maddie Ellis
The acoustic section of the "Eras Tour" is known to make every show unique, and fans are hoping for something extra special to end the tour. 
The acoustic set has historically occurred right after "The Tortured Poets Department" set, meaning it's just a few minutes away. 
Based on the timing of her past two concerts in Vancouver, tune in around 1:40 a.m. ET/ 10:40 p.m. PT for tonight's surprise songs. 
Amy Eley
Swift revealed in "The Eras Tour Book," just released Nov. 29, that there is an actual person inside the moving platform she stands on top of while singing "Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?" during "The Tortured Poets Department" section of the show.
“The ‘rover’ platform I travel on is actually operated by a crew member, who lays inside the platform and drives it from inside,” she wrote, blowing the minds of fans far and wide.
Maddie Ellis
After the fires of "Bad Blood," Swift moves into the set she's affectionately nicknamed "female rage, the musical": "The Tortured Poets Department." 
Featuring the music of her 11th studio album, which dropped in April, the "Tortured Poets" set debuted in Paris on May 9, 2024 — and fans have never been the same. 
Amy Eley
Taylor Swift has wrapped up the "Folklore" and "Evermore" eras, and we're into "1989." The singer is wearing the iconic two-piece outfit for the set, with a yellow top and red skirt. A possible nod to the "Chiefs" win? 
Amy Eley
Taylor Swift's bewitched performance of her song "Willow" extended into the crowd as fans held up glowing balloons, resembling the glowing orbs dancers perform with during the song.
Maddie Ellis
Keeping with tradition, the Vancouver crowd held up their phone flashlights while Taylor Swift sang the moving "Evermore" track, "Marjorie." 
"Marjorie" is dedicated to Swift's maternal grandmother, opera singer Marjorie Finlay. In the song, Swift sings about her grandmother's advice and incorporates snippets of Finlay's voice.
Maddie Ellis
After a moving standing ovation, Taylor Swift thanked the crowd for the support of her, her crew and her band.
"This tour has been the adventure of a lifetime, and I speak on behalf of my band, my crew, who all left their families and spent time away from everything they know and love and performed when they were sick, when anything was going on in their lives, they made sure this show happened for you," Swift said. "We will never forget you giving us that moment."
Amy Eley
Attendees pulled off another incredibly coordinated fan project after Taylor Swift performed "Champagne Problems." The crowd of more than 50,000 people broke out singing "Happy Birthday" to the pop star, who turns 35 on Dec. 13, all while giving her a three-minute standing ovation. 
Swifties have posted about the plan to sing "Happy Birthday" across social platforms over the last few weeks. Cheers to them for pulling it off!
Amy Eley
"It's crazy I'm about to sing the last song I'll ever sing in the 'Folklore' cabin," Taylor Swift said as she stood in the open-faced cabin set of the "Folklore" and "Evermore" era.
"It was a pretend escape place in mind," she continued when discussing the setting of the 2020 album. "It really took my mind off of what was happening in the world at the time. I started writing 'Folklore' two days into the pandemic. This was a way for me to get out of myself."
Maddie Ellis
Moving right along, it's time to get woodsy and witchy. The combined "Folklore" and "Evermore" set is here. 
Before May 2024, the eras were separate sets, but to make room for "The Tortured Poets Department," Swift united the sister albums, both of which dropped in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swift has OKed calling the combined set “Everlore” or “Folkmore." 
Amy Eley
As Taylor Swift rerecords and releases a number of her albums (here's why), fans have been on the edge of their seats speculating exactly when she will announce "Reputation (Taylor's Version)." 
Swifties have predicted and planned around so many dates since July 2023. Clues seemed to have indicated it was only a matter of time ... but there's still no official word on a release date for the album. 
Amy Eley
And I'm back because yes, "Speak Now" was in fact just as short as it always is. So we are rolling right into "Reputation" in all its snake glory. 
Amy Eley
We are now in the "Speak Now" era, but only for a moment. 
This album, originally released in 2010, is Taylor Swift's shortest era on the tour with only "Enchanted" performed in the show's current state. (She added "Long Live" in the summer of 2023 before taking it out again when she needed time to add in an era for "The Tortured Poets Department" after its 2024 release.)
Amy Eley
Before singing "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)," Taylor Swift took a moment to pay tribute to the fans and what they have created at the shows. 
"The tour has been different from any tour I’ve ever done before in so many ways I can’t count, but I’d like to tell you a few. I’ve been touring since I was 15 years old and basically what I would do in the beginning … I would make an album, and then I would go on tour and the tour would be named after that album."
"And then I ended up putting out so much music so quickly that basically I had to think of a new way to do it, and I really hoped it was something that you would like, and I came with this idea of the 'Eras Tour.'
"And then the craziest thing about this has been — and the reason this has been the longest tour — is because you guys have made this into something completely unrecognizable from anything I’ve ever done in my life with your traditions, your passion...
"I never thought that writing one line about friendship bracelets would have you guys all making friendship bracelets, making friends and bringing joy to each other. That is the lasting legacy of this tour, that you have created such a space of joy and togetherness and love, and I couldn’t be more proud of you, honestly. That is all you."
Maddie Ellis
While Taylor Swift wraps up the "Red" era, the Kansas City Chiefs are celebrating a narrow victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. 
In the final second of the game, the Chiefs kicked a field goal that bounced off the uprights and through the posts for the win. The final score was 19-17.
Immediately after, the term "tayvoodoo," a portmanteau of Taylor and voodoo, started trending on X, crediting her with the win from miles away.
"this was tayvoodoo, you won’t convince me otherwise," one person said on X.
Amy Eley
In perhaps one of the sweetest parts of the show, Taylor Swift has given away the final "22" hat to a very excited girl! 
For those of you unfamiliar with this portion of the concert, Swift dances to the end of the stage singing her song "22." She then greets a fan who has been selected by her team and gets to have a moment with the icon. She kneels down, chats briefly with the concertgoer, then bestows upon them the fedora she is wearing. 
Jason Kelce, brother to Travis Kelce and former NFL player, said witnessing that interaction for the first time made him cry.
“It was f--king so special," he said in an episode of "New Heights. "It was great.”
To mark the last "Eras Tour" show, when dancer Kameron Saunders took the mic during "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," he said: "For the last time, no!"
"This is not Taylor's Version." 
Amy Eley
We have flowed right into the third era as Taylor Swift sings "22" to mark the "Red" album, which originally released in 2012. So far, no major surprises or changes to the show compared to her many, many previous concerts. But the night is young!
Amy Eley
Paul Sidoti, Taylor Swift's longtime guitarist, took the stage with other bandmates to perform "You Belong With Me." He wrote on Instagram just days ago that this song "has always been one of my favorites and the title pretty much sums up the last two years with you all."
Maddie Ellis
With the sweet, nostalgic strums of the title track, we've officially left the "Lover" era and entered "Fearless," Swift's second studio album.
Amy Eley
Just prior to singing "Lover," the last song in the show's first era, Swift spoke to the audience to honor the final show.
"We have toured the entire world with this tour. We have had so many adventures. It has been the most exciting, powerful, electrifying, intense, most challenging thing I’ve ever done in my entire life," she said. "We’ve gotten to perform for over 10 million people on this tour. And tonight, we get to play one last show for you here tonight in beautiful Vancouver ... We are about to go on one last grand adventure together." 
Maddie Ellis
Taylor Swift is currently in the "Lover" era of her final "Eras Tour" show. Meanwhile, Travis Kelce and the Chiefs are playing a tight game against the Los Angeles Chargers. With just over two minutes to go, the Chargers lead 17-16. 
"the chiefs game being on at the same time as the last eras show is giving troy and gabriella," one X user wrote, referencing "High School Musical." 
*Cue the screaming of "Cruel Summer."

Taylor Swift has officially taken the stage to kick off the final concert on the "Eras Tour" in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Lady Gaga's "Applause" is playing in BC Place. 
Swifties, you know what that means. Just a few minutes until Taylor Swift takes the stage for the last time on her "Eras Tour." 
Amy Eley
While Travis Kelce has attended (and participated in) "Eras Tour" concerts since Taylor Swift played in Kansas City in July 2023, he will not be at her last show of the tour. 
Why? He has his regular job as a tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL team is playing the Los Angeles Chargers Sunday night at Arrowhead Stadium. 
And it's a tight game, for all you football fans out there. In the minutes before Swift is expected to take the stage, the Chiefs lead the Chargers 16-14 as the game goes into the fourth quarter.

To end her time on the "Eras Tour" stage, Abrams sang "Close To You," the fan-favorite track she released earlier this year after teasing it for seven years.
Before the audience sang along, Abrams again thanked Swift and the team that made the "Eras Tour" possible, including dancers, the crew and more. 
"I wish that you all knew them personally they are just actually magically people," she said.
Abrams wiped her eyes as she exited the stage. 
Maddie Ellis
True Swifties know that the "Eras Tour" has something like an alter ego: "The Errors Tour," the name given to little onstage gaffes.
There was the time when Swift's microphone stopped working during the "Lover" set. After she frantically tapped the mic and turned it on and off again, she tried to scream into the mic (to no avail) as the audience roared with laughter. 
Then there were plenty of minor stage malfunctions. In Cincinnati, the stage didn't lower the singer on cue, forcing Swift to sprint offstage to make her next costume change. (Swift reacted to the moment on TikTok, commenting, “still swift af boi.”)
And narrowly avoiding injury, in Tokyo, Swift almost slipped off the prop house that she uses onstage during the "Folklore" set. “I almost fell off the ‘Folklore’ cabin, but I didn’t, and that’s the lesson," she said onstage after. "My life flashed before my eyes."

The TODAY team has officially made it to BC Place for the final night of the "Eras Tour." 
NBC News correspondent Emilie Ikeda, who has been covering the "Eras Tour" on the ground since it kicked off in Arizona last March, celebrated the occasion with a friendship bracelet-filled Instagram post. 
Maddie Ellis
Gracie Abrams has officially taken the stage at BC Place in Vancouver, starting the final "Eras Tour" show. 
For her first song, Abrams performed "Risk" from her most recent album, "The Secret of Us."
"Tonight is history," Abrams said to open the show, before reading a note she wrote.
"Can you believe that this is the final night of the 'Eras Tour'? As a fan, I cannot comprehend what this really means... I don't know about you, but I'm not ready for it to be over," she said. 
"I'm not saying that because I had the privilege of being one of her lucky openers, I'm saying it because like all of you, I've grown up with Taylor's songs. Magically meeting a moment in my life that I didn't think anyone else could understand or know or ached or yearned or loved or lost. And yet she did," she added. 
She asked, "How are we supposed to have the words for her?" 
She went on to thank Swift for her "generosity, curiosity, her wild and unparalleled pen, her superpower of seeing into our lives and creating soundtracks for every single formative moment that we've had, and that we will have." 
"She has given us these things, and tonight, we are all here to remind her how deeply she's touched us," she said. "How much we appreciate every single tiny detail she dreams up to delight us, and to thank her, from the bottom of our hearts, for giving us the time of our lives."

In August, Taylor Swift gave her fans two gifts at once: a music video for her song “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” and a behind-the-scenes look at the “Eras Tour.”
On Aug. 20, after finishing the final show of the tour’s European leg in London, a music video for “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” began playing on Wembley Stadium’s large screen when Swift left the stage. 
Swift is seen in multiple shots rehearsing the tour in sound stages, on the “Eras” set itself, underneath the stage and backstage with her crew.
The song seemingly refers to performing her “Eras” shows while heartbroken from a relationship. Fans have speculated that it could be about either Joe Alwyn, whom Swift dated for six years before their split became public in April 2023, or Matty Healy, whom she was rumored to be dating after.
Swift's current boyfriend, Travis Kelce, made an appearance onstage at the “Eras Tour” in June before the singer performed “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” in London.

For most Swifties, one does not just attend the "Eras Tour." 
Concertgoers went to incredible lengths to put together outfits for the shows that reflect some aspect of Swift's career. 
“Someone came as a crumpled-up piece of paper from ‘All Too Well,’” Kelsey Barnes, who attended opening night in Arizona, told TODAY.com in March 2023. “People will take the tiniest little thing that Taylor says and make an entire aesthetic out of it. It’s amazing.”
Even the TODAY anchors got to join in on some of the fun in October when Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Jenna Bush Hager and Craig Melvin's wife, Lindsay Czarniak, attended one of the Miami shows together. Guthrie and her family wore shirts stitched with Swift lyrics. Our personal favorite may have been her husband, Mike Feldman, wearing a shirt that reads "knows every song (all too well)."
Amy Eley
The final concert for "The Eras Tour" is scheduled to begin at 6:45 p.m. PT, or 9:45 p.m. ET. Gracie Abrams will be opening for Swift for the final time of the tour. 
If the prior two nights in Vancouver are any indication, Swift should be taking the stage just before 8 p.m. PT. East Coasters following along, prepare for a late night with an about 11 p.m. ET start time. 
Swift's show typically runs for 3.5 hours, putting the final bows at around 11:30 p.m. PT, or 2:30 a.m. ET.
For concert attendees, there is one major hint that Swift's 46-song performance is about to begin: "Applause" by Lady Gaga will play in the venue.

The entire world seemed to be waiting in anticipation to see if Taylor Swift could in fact make it from her Feb. 10, 2024, “Eras Tour” show in Tokyo to the Super Bowl on Feb. 11, 2024, in Las Vegas, where her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, was playing as the Kansas City Chiefs took on the San Francisco 49ers. 
Even the Embassy of Japan issued a statement on the matter assuring fans that it was in fact possible for her to cross nine time zones and make the football game. And she sure did, showing up with friend and actor Blake Lively to cheer on Kelce, whose team won 25-22. 
When celebrating on the field with Kelce after the game, the NFL star asked Swift if she was tired, prompting a response that has become as iconic as the pop star herself: "Jet lag is a choice."
TikTok star Victoria Browne made the same journey from the Tokyo concert to the Las Vegas Super Bowl and wrote about the whirlwind experience, saying the energy in the football stadium made up for any cross-Atlantic exhaustion.

Huge names joined Taylor Swift onstage over the course of the "Eras Tour," including Ed Sheeran, Ice Spice, Maren Morris and Marcus Mumford. But it was Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who shocked fans worldwide when he popped up onstage in London.
The Kansas City Chiefs star popped up onstage at London's Wembley Stadium on June 23. He participated in a sketch between Swift's performance of "The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived" and "I Can Do It With A Broken Heart." 
The crowd roared and social media exploded with reactions (including one from Swift's own dancer Kameron Saunders). The moment was particularly significant when considering how private Swift has been in past relationships. (For reference, she and Joe Alwyn, who dated for six years, were rarely photographed together.)
While Kelce appeared at several concerts before the moment and after, that was the only time we saw the Super Bowl champion onstage. 
Sadly he is not expected at the final night as the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers Sunday night.

After Taylor Swift debuted her relationship with tight end Travis Kelce by attending a Chiefs game in September 2023, fans wondered when he would repay the favor. 
Kelce attended his first "Eras Tour" show since dating Swift on Nov. 11, 2023, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And his appearance in the crowd introduced one of our favorite traditions: the "Karma" lyric change.
On Nov. 11, 2023, instead of singing, "Karma is the guy on the screen/ Coming straight home to me," Swift memorably changed the bridge to, "Karma is the guy on the Chiefs/ Coming straight home to me." 
Kelce later said on his podcast that the moment "shocked" him. In videos from the concert, the football star was standing next to Swift's dad, Scott, who tried unsuccessfully to give Kelce a high-five after the moment.
“Yeah, Mr. Swift, I apologize, big guy, and I missed that. I never miss a high-five too. Big high five guy. It’s the most electric thing you can do at an event, so sorry, Mr. Swift,” Travis Kelce said on his podcast.
Swift went on to uphold the lyric change tradition every time Kelce attended an "Eras Tour" show. 
Maddie Ellis
While every "Eras Tour" show is special, one U.S. stop looms large as the point where, in hindsight, everything had changed: Kansas City.
Right before the Missouri stop, Swift gave fans a look at her famous Fourth of July party, featuring friends Selena Gomez, Danielle, Alana and Este Haim and more. The Haim sisters captioned the pics "single summer" — notable because reports that Swift and Joe Alwyn had split were just months old — while Swift said on Instagram, “Happy belated Independence Day from your local neighborhood independent girlies. See you tonight Kansas Cityyy.”
Swift stopped in Kansas City on July 7 and 8 of 2023, celebrating the rerelease of her third studio album "Speak Now." Joey King and Taylor Lautner — the stars of her "I Can See You" music video — memorably joined her (complete with a backflip from Lautner) onstage. Joey King's older sister, Hunter, also an actor, attended the show on July 7.
On July 8, 2023, Travis Kelce was in the crowd of the "Eras Tour" show on his team's field at Arrowhead Stadium. He famously went on to announce to the world that he tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at the show. (She later called this move "metal as hell," effectively ending her "single summer.")
Hunter King went on to star in the Hallmark holiday film loosely inspired by Swift and Kelce, "Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story" opposite Tyler Hynes and (who else?) Donna Kelce.

Every single night of the "Eras Tour" has been unique, in part because of the show's acoustic section, affectionately known to Swifties as "Surprise Song O'Clock." At this time in the night, Swift performs two or more surprise songs acoustically on the piano and guitar.
Click here for a list of every surprise song Swift performed, broken down by each concert.
As she worked through her discography, she started performing unexpected mashups of songs across themes and eras, creating truly memorable performances. 
Here are a few we'll never get over: 
The mashup that started it all. Shortly after "1989 (Taylor's Version)" dropped, Swift combined her energetic vault track "Is It Over Now?" with the fan-favorite staple "Out of the Woods" for a thrilling acoustic guitar performance that had audiences screaming along.  
Swift debuted the "Tortured Poets" track "The Bolter" in Edinburgh and perfectly paired it with "Getaway Car" on the acoustic guitar, connecting the shared theme of running from a relationship.
Here, Swift combined "Midnights" bonus track "The Great War" with the album's vault track, "You're Losing Me," to paint a picture of relationships with very different outcomes. In "The Great War," two people fight to save a relationship from the brink of ending. But in "You're Losing Me," the song's narrator mourns a relationship that has ended due to inaction and indifference.
This rare three-song mashup was seemingly dedicated to Travis Kelce. The mashup put special emphasis on the lyrics, “I’ll be 87; You’ll be 89" — Kelce's jersey number and Swift's birth year (1989) — and featured "So High School," a song thought to be about Kelce. (Yes, Kelce was in the audience for the performance.)
This mashup showed that like all of us, Swift also couldn't get Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso" out of her head. Carpenter made a special appearance for the performance and let Swift sing the fan-favorite lyric, “I’m working late ‘cause I’m a singer."

While the "Eras Tour" has been going on for nearly two years — amid a new album release and two rerecording drops – not everything has changed.
Here are the notable songs/eras that have seen significant adjustments throughout the tour.
One of the first songs to get cut was "Invisible String," a sweet track from "Folklore" about all the little signs that, in hindsight, may represent a fated love. On March 31, 2023, Swift replaced "Invisible String" with "The 1," a song about a relationship that didn't work out. (Less than two weeks after the change, outlets reported that Swift and her then-boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn, split up.)
When Phoebe Bridgers opened for the "Eras Tour" in May 2023, Swift briefly extended her "Red" set to include "Nothing New," her duet with Bridgers from "Red (Taylor's Version)."
Originally the only song in the "Speak Now" era was "Enchanted." But after "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" came out in July 2023, Swift added the rousing fan-favorite track "Long Live" to the set. However, "Long Live" was cut in May 2024 to make room for the "Tortured Poets Department" set.
Swift originally opened the "Evermore" set with "Tis the Damn Season," but swapped it for the mysterious rock track "No Body, No Crime" starting July 22, 2023, once the featured band Haim joined Swift on the tour as her opener. "Tis the Damn Season" was added back when Haim was no longer on the tour, but the song was ultimately cut to make room for "Tortured Poets" in May 2024.
Swift's 11th studio album, "The Tortured Poets Department," dropped April 19. She resumed the "Eras Tour" on May 9 in Paris and debuted an adjusted setlist to make room for the new era. 
She added seven songs (eight, if you count the addition of "Florida!!!" performed with Florence Welch in London and Miami.)
And cut: 
She also changed the order of the eras, with "Red" immediately following "Fearless," followed by "Speak Now," "Reputation" and a combined "Evermore" and "Folklore" set. "The Tortured Poets Department" set came after "1989" and before the acoustic set.

For most people, the last time they tried to thread craft beads onto plastic string was at summer camp. Swifties have changed that.
Beaded friendship bracelets are now a ubiquitous sighting at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour shows, sported by fans and celebrities alike during, and often after, the concert.
In a trend reminiscent of childhood toy swaps, fans trade bracelets with each other at shows, and many Swifties have displayed bracelet collections that stretch all the way from their wrists to their elbows.
Here’s everything you need to know about the Eras Tour friendship bracelet trend and how it began.
Why are Swifties trading friendship bracelets? Inside the nostalgic trend

What many concertgoers have found remarkable of Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour" performance is her endurance for the over three-hour show with limited breaks. While being interviewed as Time's Person of the Year in 2023, Swift shared how she prepared to pull off the physical feat.
“Every day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,” she told Time, adding that this started six months prior to the first show. “Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.”
She also incorporated strength-training workouts and cut out alcohol when she was on the road.
“Doing that show with a hangover," she said, "I don’t want to know that world.”
TODAY contributing writer Stephanie Mansour attempted the treadmill workout herself and described is as "so fun ... and extremely challenging."

Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour" is officially ending Dec. 8 in Vancouver. The first show in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023, introduced fans to a setlist that largely stayed the same, though shifted with the addition of an "era" and the release of "Taylor's Version" rerecordings.
Flashback to Night 1 of the "Eras Tour" with this complete setlist from opening night:
