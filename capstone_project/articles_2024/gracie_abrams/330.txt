NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour continued its takeover of the Big Easy as night two brought upwards of 65,000 fans to the Caesars Superdome. 
Swifties in the Superdome were stunned as fellow pop mega-star Sabrina Carpenter made a surprise guest appearance on stage with Swift.

For the occasion, Swift did something she normally doesn’t do. 
“I think tonight I’m going to do something completely different, which is that I’m going to sing a song that’s not mine, but it’s somebody that I really love,” the singer said to her sold-out crowd. 
Swift began strumming her guitar and singing a few lines to “Espresso,” Carpenter‘s hit single that has dominated the charts this year. Swift rarely performs covers, so fans may have wondered if She had a trick up her sleeve.
Sure enough, Swift stopped playing the song and called her friend on stage from her cell phone on speaker before asking, “Why aren’t you here with us right now?”
Not long after that, Carpenter entered the stage singing the lead while Swift strummed and sang harmony in front of a frenzy of fans who saw two titans of pop music on stage together.

Before exiting, Carpenter performed Swift’s “Is it Over Now?” and her other hit single “Please, Please, Please” as a duo. 
Swifties from all over packed the stadium, dressed in glitter, sparkles, and outfits representing their favorite Taylor eras.
Swift took the stage to an eruption of cheers and kept the energy high throughout the night. Saturday’s performance saw the Superdome filled, with fans belting out every lyric along with Swift.
She gifted her iconic “22″ hat to another lucky fan, a cherished moment she shares during every stop of her tour. The recipient, a young fan in tears, received the hat as the crowd cheered on. It’s a memory that is sure to last a lifetime.
During her song “22″,” Swift chooses a lucky fan to give the hat to, which she dates and autographs with a metallic marker. Sometimes, the picks are random; in other cases, they are picked by Swift’s team because they went viral, showed their fandom, or had inspiring stories.
During Friday night’s show, the superstar expressed her love for the city during the concert, telling the crowd, “We’ve got to end (The Eras Tour) in the most fun cities with the most passionate fans.” 
The crowd proved her right, traveling from the Gulf South and beyond, singing along to every lyric, screaming with joy, and showing off their custom-made outfits inspired by the different eras of Swift’s career.

The local economy is seeing a boost, with hotels in multiple parishes filled to capacity and restaurants, bars, and boutiques benefitting from the influx of visitors.
Locals were taken by surprise when they saw how long lines had gotten at the iconic Cafe Du Monde in the French Quarter, or how massive the crowds were in lines for merchandise.

“Taylor Swift really is that girl,” one user posted on X.
As the sun sets over the Mississippi River Saturday night, the Superdome will once again come alive with the sounds of Swift’s setlist. Gates open at 4:30 p.m. with special guest Gracie Abrams taking the stage before Swift dazzles with her nearly three-hour-long performance, spanning her entire career from “Fearless” to “The Tortured Poets Department.”
Expect traffic to be heavy and lines to be long as Swifties arrive.
Fans should arrive early to enjoy the atmosphere around the Superdome and Champions Square, where merch stands and photo ops with a massive friendship bracelet await.

For many, Saturday marks the culmination of months of planning, saving, and dreaming for a chance to see Swift live.
From the French Quarter to the Marigny and beyond, the city is painted red (and every other era color), and the energy in New Orleans is palpable.
With one night down and two to go, the Eras Tour is shaping up to be a weekend the city - and the Swifties - won’t soon forget.
As Swift said herself, there’s no better place to wrap up the U.S. leg of her tour than in a city known for its passion, music, and unending love for a good time.
