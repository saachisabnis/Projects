Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is back once again, this time in Toronto for six dates, and if you're attending, you might be wondering: who are you going to see on stage before the headliner?
We've seen names like Suki Waterhouse open for Swift, or Sabrina Carpenter and even the band Paramore.
This time? It's a familiar face who opened for her Indianapolis and New Orleans shows as well. It's Gracie Abrams, who opened for the Eras Tour in 2023. She's the singer of songs like I miss you, I'm sorryÂ and, fun fact, she's the daughter of the great director and producer J.J. Abrams.
There's your answer! Enjoy the shows!
