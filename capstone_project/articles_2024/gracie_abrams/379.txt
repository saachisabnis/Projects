This is bigger than Mardi Gras.
On Oct. 25-27, Taylor Swift is bringing her record-breaking, headline-making, world-shaking ‘Eras Tour’ with special guest Gracie Abrams to New Orleans’ Caesar’s Superdome for three days of chart-topping hits, friendship bracelets, and good times.
And if you want to see the budding author deliver her hits live — based on our findings at Set List FM, she played 46 (!) songs at each of her three Miami concerts this past weekend — last-minute tickets are available for this weekend’s trio of Taylor Swift New Orleans ‘Eras Tour’ concerts.
At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find on Big Easy tickets was $1,014 before fees on Vivid Seats.
The two other shows have seats starting anywhere from $1,093 to $1,133 before fees.
While these tickets may seem expensive (they are!), we do have a hack for thrifty Swifties.
If you hold off on buying for a few days, prices may plummet leading up to showtime. In fact, they did just last week in Miami.
Who knows? You just might find an “Enchanted” deal that won’t have you “Down Bad.”

The 25-year-old Abrams is the daughter of “Star Trek” film director JJ Abrams and a star in her own right. Her song “I miss you, I’m sorry” has upwards of 100 million streams on Spotify, she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the 2022 “Sour Tour” and is currently on a tour of her own right now. Not a shabby track record by any stretch of the imagination.
Post-“Tortured Poet’s Department” release, Swift has incorporated the new album into her shows.

Our team has been following the ‘Eras Tour’ closely over the past year.
Just a few of the most exciting stories we’ve published include a chat with a Swiftie who shared some helpful tips about seeing Taylor live, a report on dropping ticket prices, and a list of all the most exciting fan trends.
Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released at midnight (and subsequently at 2 a.m.) on Friday, April 19.
While every listener will likely come away with their own favorites, we particularly enjoyed the sleek, synthy “Fortnight,” icy “So Long, London,” anthemic “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” bombastic slow build of “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and gorgeously arranged “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus.”
If you want to give it a spin — assuming you’re one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t listened to the overstuffed two-disc record already, that is — you can find “The Tortured Poets Department” here.
Although it will cost an arm and a leg (sometimes more!) to see Swift IRL, there are much more affordable — likely stateside — concerts you can attend this year and next.
Here are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live.
• Kacey Musgraves
• Kylie Minogue
• Billie Eilish
• Dua Lipa
• Mariah Carey
