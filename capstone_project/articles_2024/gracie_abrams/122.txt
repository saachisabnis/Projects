As Taylor Swift prepares to bring her culture-shifting Eras Tour to a close, fans still have a chance to score last-minute tickets for the final leg, which will take the superstar through Toronto and Vancouver with opening act Gracie Abrams.
Since her first Eras Tour show, in March 2023, Swift has released two rerecorded albums, dropped one entirely new album, made history (again) at the Grammys, premiered a concert film, and entered a brand-new relationship.
All the while, she has also managed to earn another accolade on her already-crowded mantle: In December 2023, the Eras Tour surpassed $1 billion in revenue, officially making it the highest-grossing music tour in history. By the time Swift wraps up the tour this December, she will have completed 152 stadium shows in front of hundreds of thousands of audience members on five different continents. 
If you’re a Swiftie who has yet to personally witness this history-making event, don’t fret—there’s still time to get a seat. Swift’s final Eras Tour shows have unsurprisingly sold out, but there are still ways to nab yourself a ticket from resellers.
Ahead, we track how and where to buy a ticket for the remaining Eras Tour shows in Canada.
