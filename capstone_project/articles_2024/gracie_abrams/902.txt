The end of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is nearly in sight.
Her penultimate stop is in Toronto, Canada, this weekend and next, where she'll perform six shows at Rogers Centre with an opening performance by Gracie Abrams. 
If you're feeling spontaneous and searching for last minute tickets to the Eras Tour, there are still seats available. The closer to the show is typically when prices start to drop. As a note, you will not be able to be near the stadium if you do not have tickets. The venue states, "To support the safe entry and exit of all fans, a ticketholder perimeter around Rogers Centre will be in effect on all show days. Non-ticketholders should not travel to Rogers Centre and will not be permitted to stand outside the stadium."
