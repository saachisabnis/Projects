In this series, Newsweek is recapping every show Taylor Swift has performed on the Eras Tour, city by city.
Swift made history in the U.K. as she took her Eras Tour to London for a second stint. The singer performed a string of dates in the city in June and circled back in August for another five concerts.
Her final night, on August 10, set a record, making her the first solo star to play Wembley Stadium eight times on one tour. Michael Jackson had held the record since 1988 after he performed seven shows at Wembley Stadium as part of his Bad Tour.
"You just made me the first solo artist to ever play Wembley eight times in a single tour," Swift told fans from the stage. "We will never, ever be able to thank you enough for it."
Wembley Stadium also marked a milestone by presenting the chart-topper with a bespoke guitar and some‚ÄØpersonalized guitar plectrums, which were shipped back to her home in Nashville, Tennessee, as she continued on the road.
The London gig marked the end of the European leg of Swift's tour, and she then headed back to the U.S. for her Miami dates.
Swift said on Instagram that "walking onstage in London was a roller coaster of emotions" as it came after the cancellation of her Vienna concerts. The singer had been set to perform in the Austrian capital earlier in August, but her gigs were called off after a planned terror attack was uncovered.
However, she said the London stint felt "like a beautiful dream sequence."
"All five crowds at Wembley Stadium were bursting with passion, joy and exuberance," she said. "The energy in that stadium was like the most giant bear hug from 92,000 people each night, and it brought me back to a place of carefree calm up there."
