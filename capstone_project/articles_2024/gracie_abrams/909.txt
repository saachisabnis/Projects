Gracie Abrams’ duet with Taylor Swift on “Us” is a high point on her Billboard Top 5 hit album, The Secret of Us. The song was just honored with a 2025 Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. During Swift’s Eras Tour show in Toronto on Saturday (November 16), the pop superstar brought out her opening act Abrams to sing a duet on “Us” to celebrate their Grammy nod. The pair also sang Swift’s 1989 hit, “Out of the Woods,” during the surprise songs part of her set. Abrams opened for Swift during her 2023 Eras Tour, and the singers quickly bonded together. “Gracie was opening for me like a year ago on The Eras Tour, and we made so many fun memories,” Swift said as she introduced Abrams. “One of my favorites was celebrating her Grammy nomination for best new artist. We went out that night and had, like, eleventy-hundred cosmos.” Swift revealed that they were “feral screeching” on the phone together when they heard “Us” had been nominated for a Grammy.
