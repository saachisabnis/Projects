Tulsa, Oklahoma'sÂ WilderadoÂ â€“ Max Rainer (lead singer, guitarist), Tyler Wimpee (guitarist, vocals), Justin Kila (drums) â€“ will be joiningÂ Mt. JoyÂ on August 9th for a show atÂ Red Rocks AmphitheatreÂ in Morrison, CO. The news of the show comes as the band gets ready to hit the road again on July 19th and gears up for the release of their new full-length studio albumÂ TalkerÂ â€“ due out September 20th viaÂ Bright Antenna Records. The new LP was recorded in Norman, Oklahoma, and produced byÂ Chad CopelinÂ (Sufjan Stevens,Â SYML) andÂ James McAlisterÂ (Gracie Abrams,Â The National).
In addition to kicking off their next leg of headline dates on July 19th, Wilderado is one of the featured artists on the newÂ TwistersÂ soundtrack. For the release, Max joined forces withÂ Ken PomeroyÂ and James McAlister for a cover of "Wall Of Sound" - written byÂ Richard ThompsonÂ and previously covered byÂ REM.
Wilderadoâ€™s expansive indie rock fuses soaring vocals and rumbling guitars with an open-road, Americana-inspired feel. Since first forming, they have been steadily building a passionate fan base, accruingÂ 200+ MILLIONÂ streams andÂ 3+ MILLIONÂ monthly listeners across platforms and their live following has continued to grow each year.Â TalkerÂ will follow the bandâ€™s self-titled debut full-length that was released in October 2021 via Bright Antenna Records and led to their Late Night TV Debut onÂ Jimmy Kimmel Live!Â and AM TV Debut onÂ CBS Saturday Morning. Spring 2023 had Wilderado touring withÂ My Morning JacketÂ and releasingÂ Wilderado LiveÂ â€“ their first ever live LP featuring career spanning songs including â€œSurefireâ€� and â€œHead Rightâ€� (two Top 10 Alt Radio hits from Wilderado) along with several older songs including â€œWheatâ€� and â€œMorning Lightâ€� as well as fan favorite â€œRubble to Rubble.â€� For the most up-to-date information visitÂ HERE.
