Taylor Swift kept it short and sweet while celebrating the end of her Eras Tour, which she remembers all too well.
Swift, 34, paid homage to her time on the road by quoting her own lyrics from “All Too Well” on Wednesday, December 11. “It was rare. I was there. I remember it. ♥️,” she captioned the tour snaps via Instagram.
The singer slightly tweaked the last line of her 2012 hit, which originally was written as, “It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well.” Swift dropped the “all too well,” but the sentiment of the beloved song was evident in the photos she chose to go with it.
Among the snaps she posted was one of her strutting toward the front of the stage as her dance company cheered from behind. She included a hugging photo with her dancers and one of her sticking her tongue out cheekily mid-show.
Swift posed in the cleaning cart used to hide her from fans on the way to stage in a separate image. She featured several snaps of herself belting out her hits as well as two with opener Gracie Abrams. The final snapshot showed Swift waving to the crowd as pyrotechnics went off behind her.
The Grammy winner kicked off her record-breaking Eras Tour in Glendale, Arizona, in March 2023. She concluded her U.S. run in August 2023 before going overseas for stops in Asia, South America, Australia and Europe from November 2023 through this August.
In October, Swift embarked on the final leg of her shows in the U.S. and Canada. Her very last performance took place on Sunday, December 8, in Vancouver, Canada.
Abrams, 25, was her opening performer for the monumental show and she didn’t take the honor lightly. Before doing her set, Abrams read a speech to the crowd, confessing she was “not ready for it to be over” before praising Swift.
“Like all of you, I [was] brought up with Taylor’s songs. Magically, needing a moment in my life that I didn’t think anyone else could understand or know or ached or yearned or loved or lost, and yet she did,” she said via a video shared on TikTok. “How are we supposed to have the words for it? We don’t yet. But I do know that we have each other, thanks to Taylor, her music, her generosity, her curiosity, her wild and unparalleled pen, her superpower of seeing into our lives and creating soundtracks for every single formative moment we’ve had and that we will have.”
Abrams then got emotional, saying, “We are all here to remind her how deeply she’s touched us.” She continued, “How much we appreciate every single tiny detail that she dreams up to delight us and to thank her, from the bottom of our hearts, for giving us the time of our lives.”
Swift, meanwhile, closed out her tour on Sunday by thanking fans for “being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my life to date — my beloved Eras Tour.” She ended the night by performing “Karma” off her 2022 album, Midnights.
As she’s done throughout the tour, Swift didn’t miss her chance to give boyfriend Travis Kelce a shout-out during the song, singing, “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs.”

Kelce, 35, who sparked a romance with Swift in summer 2023 after failing to give her a friendship bracelet at her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City, was in awe of his girlfriend after her massive success. (She sold out 149 concerts across five continents in nearly two years, earning her the title of highest-grossing tour of all time.)
“Shout-out to Tay, and the unbelievable Eras Tour has finally come to an end,” Kelce said during the Wednesday episode of his and brother Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast.
He added: “Shout-out to everybody that was a part of that show. Obviously, it’s her music, her tour and everything, but that was a full production, man. That thing was the best tour in the world because of a lot of people, but mostly because of Taylor.”
