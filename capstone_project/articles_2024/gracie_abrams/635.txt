Following the highly anticipated announcement of Gracie Abrams’ The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour and due to overwhelming fan demand, the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter has added a second date at the Kia Forum in Inglewood on Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025.
This new performance follows the previously announced show on Wednesday, Aug. 6, as part of Abrams’ North American run. The tour celebrates Abrams’ highly acclaimed sophomore album, “The Secret of Us Deluxe,” which features tracks like “That’s So True” and “Close To You.” Rising indie-pop sensation Role Model will join Abrams as the opening act for the tour.
Released earlier this year, “The Secret of Us Deluxe” became Abrams’ first No.1 record in the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands, while debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S. The album has been widely praised for its emotionally resonant lyrics and introspective storytelling, solidifying Abrams’ reputation as a force in modern pop.
Tickets for the newly added date at the Kia Forum will be available to fans who previously registered for the artist presale starting at 10 a.m. Thursday, Dec. 12 at Gracieabrams.com. General tickets for both Los Angeles shows and other North American tour dates will go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, Dec. 13 at Ticketmaster.com.
Abrams has had a landmark year, from her sold-out headlining tours to her return as direct support for Taylor Swift’s blockbuster Eras Tour. With her poignant lyrics and heartfelt performances, Abrams continues to establish herself as one of her generation’s most compelling singer-songwriters. Abrams was up for Best New Artist at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Most recently, Gracie earned her second Grammy nod for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.
