Chris Rock is set to return to Saturday Night Live on December 14, marking his fourth time hosting the iconic NBC sketch show. Rock, who was a cast member from 1990 to 1993, will take the stage as the show approaches the conclusion of its 2024 season. The musical guest for the episode will be rising pop sensation Gracie Abrams, making her SNL debut.
This announcement comes as SNL gears up for its milestone 50th anniversary celebration, scheduled for February 2025. “We’re thrilled to welcome Chris back to SNL,” a show insider shared. “He’s a comedic powerhouse, and audiences can expect an unforgettable night.”
Rock has hosted SNL three times previously—in November 1996, November 2014, and October 2020. His return comes amidst the show’s tradition of featuring former cast members as hosts, especially during significant moments in the program’s history.
The December 14 episode isn’t the only notable event on the calendar. On December 21, SNL alum Martin Short will host alongside musical guest Hozier. Short, who was a cast member during the 1984–1985 season, has hosted the show five times before. He last appeared in December 2022, co-hosting with his Only Murders in the Building co-star Steve Martin.
“It’s always a thrill to come back to Studio 8H,” Short said in a statement. “The energy is unmatched, and it’s an honor to close out such an important season.”
Meanwhile, Gladiator II star Paul Mescal will host the next new episode on December 7, with Grammy-nominated country artist Shaboozey as the musical guest.
Fans of Saturday Night Live can expect a mix of nostalgia and fresh talent as the show wraps up 2024. With the 50th season celebrations just around the corner, December’s lineup promises to deliver standout performances from some of the biggest names in comedy and music.
