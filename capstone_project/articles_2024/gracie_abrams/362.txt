Looks like Short N Sweet is set to be the first 2024 album with two multi-week top 5 hits.
& no 2023 album did that either.
Harry’s House: yes
Future Nostalgia: yes
Sour: yes
Midnights: no, but Cruel Summer blew up and then the newly released Is It Over Now smashed for a few weeks as well
A big debut for the album should clinch that aoty nom.
Get real!  Charlie XCX and Lorde are NOT happening in Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.  Pure delusion.

but it should. and it should even win, dare i say.
FOR YOUR GRAMMYS CONSIDERATION :
MAGDALENA BAY - IMAGINAL DISK
Good Luck Babe is predicted to chart at #12 next week. It’s going to hit the top 10 and potentially the top 5 right before voting. This puts Chappell in a very good position to break into GF and Pop categories that she’s currently an outsider in.
i think she has a better chance at an aoty nom than a pop vocal album nom.
i remember montero, hollywood’s bleeding, norman rockwell, melodrama, etc making it to aoty but not a genre album category.
it’ll be interesting to see the trajectory.
Yeah, I don’t see her in Pop field. Unless she smashes hard before the first voting round.
nfr and melodrama are saved in aoty by the panel. there is no panel to save ‘brat’ rt now. charli will have to get in on a straight vote.
i must go punch that baby.

Nothing I’ve said has anything to do with defending cops. I’ve had enough problems with cops to know the issue isn’t what you say. You just go by what you see in the media, and see everything as us vs. them. My comment was a direct response to someone saying something unproblematic is problematic. 
That’s telling something we already knew just by looking at your avatar

Charli needs to submit in dance/electronic to have support in AOTY, the album is doing well and it has a good buzz. I feel safe about 5 contenders in AOTY (Billie, Beyoncé, Sabrina, Taylor and Ariana), the last three spots are open.
Honey, how the fuck are users feeling “safe” about Sabrina Crapenter in Album of the Year when the album is NOT even out yet?  Make it make sense.
Pop girlies have no chance in the US I fear

I think she’s getting in even if the album is shitty. See Endless Summer Vacation.
I want a Benson Boone erasure, i’ve had enough of white males in pop

Huh? Females dominated pop for years and besides Justin Beiber and Harry Styles there’s literally no « white males » in pop… (race card once again)
And who are those white males in pop? Ed Sheeran and Justin Timberlake are over. Shawn Mendes too. Justin Bieber didn’t release anything in 3 years. We don’t have a male popstar right now. Only Harry Styles.
