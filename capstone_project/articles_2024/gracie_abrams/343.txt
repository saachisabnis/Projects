Taylor Swift's new album coupled with her Eras Tour approaching with stops at New Orleans' Caesars Superdome this fall, Louisiana Swifties are buzzing with excitement. However, this enthusiasm has also attracted scammers looking to capitalize on the hype. Numerous reports and personal accounts have surfaced, highlighting an increase in Facebook scams offering fake Taylor Swift tickets at too-good-to-be-true prices.
One typical scam involves posts like the following: “Anyone looking for (4) Taylor Swift with Gracie Abrams tickets for her concert at Caesars Superdome - New Orleans, LA. Date: Friday, October 25 • 7:00 pm. I've got them available at Section 110, Row 24, Seats 1-4 if anyone would be interested in buying them. Thanks.” These posts often list tickets at unusually low prices, such as $250 each—a red flag considering the high demand and standard pricing for Swift’s tickets, which can reach up to $3,500 on reseller sites.
These scams can lead to more than just financial loss. Clicking on links provided in these deceptive posts can compromise your social media account, computer, and even your home network. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Here are some tips to help you avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes:
Real tickets will have specific fonts, time formatting, and accurate venue details (watch out for misspellings like "Caesars"). Make sure the ticket specifies the entry gate at the stadium—scammers often make up details like "side view" or "upper level."
If a friend appears to be selling tickets, contact them through another medium to confirm they are indeed the ones posting the offer.
Be skeptical of sellers asking for payment through non-traditional platforms like Venmo or Zelle without guarantees. The Louisiana Attorney General’s office advises using payment methods that offer buyer protection, such as credit cards.
Only buy tickets from trusted sources that are members of the National Association of Ticket Brokers. Websites like StubHub, VividSeats, and TicketNetwork offer guarantees that provide some level of protection against fraud.
Do not click through random ads for tickets. Instead, verify any potential purchase through trusted and secure channels.
If you suspect a scam or have fallen victim to one, report the issue to platforms like Facebook and to authorities such as the FBI’s Crime Complaint Center. Monitoring and reporting these incidents can help prevent further scams and protect other fans.
In Louisiana and beyond, Taylor Swift fans should remain vigilant and informed. Join groups like the one led by Ashley Owens, where members actively assist each other in spotting and avoiding scams. Remember, if a deal on concert tickets seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is.
