Decide which of your friends like having a really good time, then head to The ELM on Saturday for a complete Taylor Swift DJ Night experience in Bozeman. Dancing, videos, contests, super fun people, and all the hits.
Plan on just having FUN this Saturday, with a room full of people who want to have a blast too. And this IS NOT just some DJ playing Taylor Swift songs...this is going to be a 'whole thing' going on inside The ELM, featuring DJ lifebymichael.
It would be VERY wise to get tickets in advance if you're planning on going. This much fun on a Saturday night in Bozeman is likely to sell out.
DJ lifebymichael is a national Taylor Swift Party host. To be crystal clear about what to expect at this Taylor Swift DJ Night, let's hear it directly from The ELM:
This is an all ages show. No large bags or backpacks are allowed inside The ELM. There is no re-entry allowed at The ELM, so please plan accordingly.
