Watch the 2024 MTV VMAs on its rescheduled date - September 11th at 8pm! 
Originally scheduled for September 10th, the reason for the VMAs being bumped was not outright disclosed by MTV. However, their statement does suggest it's due to 'civic engagement'... the first debate of the election cycle between Trump and Harris is being held on the original date.
MTV is mindful that the bump puts the VMAs on another important day, 9/11. MTV said in their statement that they “will again support the nonprofit 9/11 Day, which organizes the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, and Tuesday’s Children, which serves the families of 9/11.”
