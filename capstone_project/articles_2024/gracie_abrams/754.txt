This week's host of "Saturday Night Live," Chris Rock, didn't mince words during his monologue about YouTuber Jake Paul, who recently fought boxing legend Mike Tyson in a Netflix live event.
Rock, who was part of the "SNL" cast in the early 1990s, said during his monologue that "it has not been good for my people... Blacks."

"It's not been a good year. Kamala. Diddy. Jake Paul beating Mike Tyson," Rock said. "Who is this Jake Paul? A 27-year-old punching a 60-year-old man in the face. Is this what the white man has reduced himself to? Stop it."
"Who's next? Morgan Freeman?" Rock added jokingly. "I hate Jake Paul. I hate him like cocaine hates monogamy."
