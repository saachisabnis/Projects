Gracie Abrams has laid out plans for her second studio album.
The follow-up to her 2023Â debut LP, 'Good Riddance', is titled 'The Secret Of Us' and will arriveÂ on June 21. It finds theÂ Los Angeles-based pop artist reunitingÂ with producer Aaron Dessner from The National, and will feature the upcoming singleÂ Risk, due out tomorrow (May 1). Posting what appears to be the record's cover artÂ to her 2.5million Instagram followers, she wrote:
"THE SECRET OF USðŸ’› the album that I made with some of my favorite people (!!!!!!!!!!) is yours JUNE 21 and the first single ðŸ’›RISKðŸ’› comes out on MAY 1! We had real, true fun writing this album. There were also the occasional tears. Audrey and I wrote Risk on our couch at home. Aaron produced the shit out of it. Abby shot the cover. The music is yours in basically five seconds and we cannot wait. I. Love. You."
Abrams supportedÂ Taylor SwiftÂ on the 2023 North American leg of her Eras World Tour. She'll also open for the superstar when the trek returns to the US in October.
