Gracie Abrams was cured of stage fright after performing on Taylor Swift's 'Eras' tour.
The 24-year-old singer was one of the opening acts for the "Cruel Summer' singer's first US leg of her concert series, and she admitted performing for her friend's crowds every night helped to "rewire a huge chunk of [her] brain" and eased her debilitating fear.
"I avoided [performing] at all costs," she told Who What Wear.
"That rewired a huge chunk of my brain — not just in terms of performing and stage fright and that kind of s*** but in my life. I told myself that I knew I would hate performing. I knew I would be uncomfortable every second that I was onstage, and I didn't end up feeling that way at all," she said.
"It was really lovely to be wrong," the "Risk" singer told the outlet.
Abrams joined Swift on stage at London's Wembley Stadium in June to perform their collaboration "Us," and the moment was an "out of body" experience for her.
"We wrote it the way that we played it at Wembley. To see somebody have the ability to, in a stadium, make it feel like you and her are the only two people there, that was hugely important for me to see.," she explained.

Abrams will rejoin the Eras tour in America and Canada next month, and is excited to play songs from her album The Secret of Us at the shows.
"I am so f****** happy that we get to do [The Secret of Us] on Eras just because so much of the album was undeniably inspired by the kind of energy that radiates from both Taylor herself and her fans, [who] are just so committed and passionate," she added.
