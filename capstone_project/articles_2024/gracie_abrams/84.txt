10/10 would wear on a red carpet if someone bothered to invite me to one.
Ever since Tyla hit the 2024 Met Gala in a dress made of literal sand our expectations have been ðŸ“ˆ when it comes to her red carpet looks. And she delivered at the 2024 MTV VMAs, showing up in a yellow mini dress made of fabric strips that cascaded into a train, which she paired with a turquoise necklace
A moment for the train!
And her gorgeous hair and makeup!
Tyla is nominated for a handful of awards at this year's VMAs, including Best New Artist (alongside Benson Boone, Chappell Roan, Gracie Abrams, Shaboozey, and Teddy Swims), Best R&B for "Water," and Best Afrobeats also for "Water."
Tyla actually told Cosmopolitan the story behind "Water," saying she never expected it to become so huge. "I recorded it in a bedroom," she said. "I never thought, This song is going to blow up. And then I started performing it and seeing everyone singing every word. And I knew it was something bigger than what we thought. People from everywhere are listening to it and dancing to it, no matter their age. Thereâ€™s babies, thereâ€™s old people. I just love that itâ€™s an African sound that is so universal."
