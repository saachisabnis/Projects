Hollywood movie star Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny, In the Bedroom, The Wrestler) is on the cover of Bare Magazine. The native New Yorker wore a lacy dress in an empty bathtub for the photo shoot.

The Oscar winner also modeled a fruit-pattern lace-up crop top and matching pants set, as seen below, and is quoted by Bare as saying: “Women’s stories and trying to bring voice to those stories keeps me very inspired and motivated. I have a hard time speaking up and kind of catching things in the moment, so I feel like being able to tell women’s stories as an actor is the one way I can contribute.”

Get ready to see more of Tomei: she’s promoting the off-Broadway stage production of Babe with her co-stars Arliss Howard and Gracie Abrams. Tomei and Howard play famous and successful record producers whose “working marriage” is turned upside when a fresh A&R hire (Gracie McGraw) “calls Abby out on the compromises she’s made in her work.” 
Babe is showing at The Pershing Square Signature Center’s Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater.
