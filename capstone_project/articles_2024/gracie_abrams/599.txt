The final leg of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour kicks off this weekend in Miami. The pop star will be playing three shows at Hard Rock Stadium, starting tomorrow night. Gracie Abrams will be opening for Swift over the three nights, and if you're still searching for tickets the Eras Tour Miami you're in luck: Prices have begun to fall on resale sites.
If you're looking to show up without a ticket, please note that Hard Rock Stadium announced: "Only fans with a parking pass and a valid concert ticket may tailgate in stadium parking lots on the date of their concert ticket. There are NO listening areas outside the stadium for people without concert tickets." In addition, they said: "There will be no merchandise stores located in the stadiumâ€™s parking lots or surrounding areas. The only merchandise store will be located inside stadium gates."
For each of the three nights in Miami, here's what we're seeing online on resale platforms StubHub, SeatGeek, and Vivid Seats. (As a note, there are currently no tickets available on Ticketmaster's resale platform, but we recommend refreshing as the show gets closer.)
The lowest prices we're seeing (as of October 17) are around $700 on StubHub, $700 on SeatGeek, and $670 on VividSeats.
