After declaring New Orleans as one of the best food cities in the world during Night 1 of Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour, Gracie Abrams thanked fans and gushed about her time in the Crescent City on Saturday night.
Abrams took the stage promptly at 6:45 p.m. and again sang "Risk" first as fans screamed every word with her. 
Before she began "I Love You, I'm Sorry," Abrams grabbed the mic to chat with the crowd.
"New Orleans," she said, "It's magical to be here." 
On Friday, she told fans she had the "best food over life" in the last 48 hours while in the city for Swift's tour. 
Abrams, wearing a long white gown, was smiling ear to ear as she continued on the microphone. 
"I'm so grateful to be a tiny, tiny part of this tour. It's just the greatest thing I've ever known," she said. "The community (of Swifties) ... is so electric."
Abrams promised she'd be in the audience listening to Swift when her set ended.
"I'm going to be in the crowd after we're done, just sobbing." 
Abrams closed her set with her hit "Close To You," but a small snafu caused her to restart, to the delight of fans.
"New Orleans you are magic. Thank you so much for being here tonight," she said before asking the crowd to scream the bridge of the song.
Swift will likely take the stage just before 8 p.m. Saturday.
