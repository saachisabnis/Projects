Taylor Swift's Eras Tour continued on Saturday night in Toronto with the third of nine total shows in Canada. The now 14-time Grammy winner has been touring almost non-stop for the entire year, and at each show she adds two "surprise songs" to her 44-song, three hour plus set list.

For her third night in Toronto, Swift once again went with the double mashups she loves so much. On guitar, Swift brought out opening act Gracie Abrams and the duo sang their Grammy-nominated song "Us" combined with "Out Of The Woods" from 1989. On piano, Swift went with a mashup of "You're On Your Own Kid" from Midnights and "long story short" from Evermore.
Next up, Swift takes a short break and then plays three more shows in Toronto before closing out the Eras Tour in Vancouver.
