Taylor Swift gifted Swifties present at her Miami Eras Tour show on Saturday (October 19) a brand new mashup of two surprise songs. 
Footage captured by an audience member (The Bolter Swiftie on Youtube) depicts the icon sitting at her piano, serenading the crowd with The Tortured Poets Department track, "loml". Being one of the surprise songs of the night, fans screamed and shouted and sang Swift's lyrics back to her, when all of a sudden, she switched tracks. 
The "Love Story" songstress dragged fans head first, Fearless, back to 2009 with "White Horse" and the stadium went absolutely wild. The star alternated between songs, seamlessly blending decades of love and heartache in the matter of minutes. 
The new mashup is not the only surprise the 34-year-old standout delivered to Miami fans as part of her three-date run of shows in The Magic City. Swift also stunned concertgoers with a fabulous, blue, sparkling gown that she's never worn on stage before, per People. 
The "Lavender Haze" hitmaker is slated to take the stage at the Hard Rock Stadium with opener Gracie Abrams for her third Miami show on Sunday (October 20). The Eras Tour, spanning nearly two years, will conclude in Vancouver, Canada, on December 8, 2024.
