Taylor Swift shared her gratitude and emotions on Instagram yesterday as her historic "Eras Tour" approaches its final shows. 
Reflecting on six unforgettable nights in Toronto, Swift thanked the city and fans for creating a “hometown show” atmosphere. 
“Couldn’t have asked for more love or generosity,” she wrote, adding how much she enjoyed performing with opening act Gracie Abrams, whom she called “just incredible.” As the end of the tour draws closer, Swift confessed, “The emotions have gotten pretty heightened… our next city will be the last one of "The Eras Tour" and the closing of the most extraordinary chapter of my life so far.” 
She wrapped up the heartfelt post by teasing her final shows in Vancouver, marking the end of her epic two-year journey.
