Taylor Swift fans who are heading to her three shows in Miami in October won’t just be limited to singing her songs only while at the Hard Rock Stadium. Brightline, the high-speed rail company throughout Florida, has partnered with iHeartRadio to offer Swifties special train rides associated with The Eras Tour stops in Miami, which will feature music, specialty cocktails, and photo opportunities for the fans.”This is more than a ride — it’s a first-of-its-kind immersive experience,” Travis Christ, Brightline’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement. The “Sing-Along” trains won’t take you directly to and from the concerts, but Brightline is promising to offer special shuttle service to the Hard Rock Stadium, which is less than 10 miles from their Aventura train station. Swift’s The Eras Tour stop in Miami is scheduled for October 18-20, with Taylor’s bestie Gracie Abrams set to open all three shows. (Axios)
