Taylor Swift welcomed a special guest on stage during her Eras Tour show in Toronto on Saturday (November 16) to sing a surprise mashup that had fans screaming in excitement. 
According to People, the "Lavender Haze" songstress brought Gracie Abrams out to help her serenade the crowd with 1989's "Out of the Woods" paired with Abram's "Us" from her latest album, The Secret Of Us, featuring Swift. 
The dazzling duo performed the unforgettable mashup dressed in glorious evening gowns with Swift in pink and orange, and Abrams in white. The crowd watched in awe as the "Karma" songstress and her special guest made night three of Swift's six-date run of Toronto shows one for the books!
The stars shared a sweet embrace to close out their epic performance and Abrams exited the stage. 
Swift has three more shows in Toronto before she jets off to Vancouver for her last three Eras Tour shows, also slated to include the "Close To You" standout. 
In June 2024, upon performing her 100th Eras Tour show, Swift revealed that the tour would end in December, candidly explaining how much time she's put into perfecting each date for her beloved Swifties.
