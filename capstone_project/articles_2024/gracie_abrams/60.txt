Here is a look at some of the week’s new music.
Taylor Swift hearts Gracie Abrams — so much so that she not only had Abrams open concerts on her Eras Tour but also sings on a track (“us”) on the fellow pop singer’s new album, “The Secret of Us” (Interscope), which was also produced by Swift cohort Aaron Dessner of the National.
Abrams is joined in the new music releases ranks this week by: “D” (United Artists Productions), Daryl Hall’s first new solo album in 11 years; Mexican singer-rapper Peso Pluma’s fourth album, “Exodo” (Double P); Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo’s “Speak Now” (Roc Nation/Bread Gang Entertainment/N-Less/CMG/Interscope); Norwegian DJ Kygo’s self-titled “Kygo” (RCA); Kehlani’s “Crash” (Atlantic); an all-star “Petty Country: A Country Music Celebration of Tom Petty” (Petty Legacy/Big Machine); and “x (10th Anniversary Edition)” (Atlantic), adding nine more tracks to Ed Sheeran’s second album.
