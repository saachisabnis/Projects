Photographer Sinna Nasseri is no stranger to high drama: Among the subjects he has photographed for Vogue over the years are the voters in swing states across America, and hopefuls at the Westminster Dog Show. It follows, then, that he has also been on hand to capture the excitement at the Met Gala—and he was back for more on Monday.
For all the cameras trained on the Met steps, there is a uniqueness to Nasseri’s imagery. No one else gets quite as close to the action, nor sees those moments that have none of the “smile and pose” polish of the red carpet, but tap directly into the energy of the night—from Donald Glover and Ayo Edebiri sharing a sly laugh in the museum’s galleries; to Måneskin’s Damiano David helpfully hoisting his girlfriend Dove Cameron’s florid train; to Kaia Gerber and Gracie Abrams gleefully reaching out to stroke Cara Delevingne’s diamond-encrusted Stella McCartney hood.
Below, revisit the 2024 Met Gala through Nasseri’s utterly irresistible lens.
