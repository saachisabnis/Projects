â€œBad Luckâ€� is the fifth single to drop ahead ofÂ TalkerÂ â€“ the bandâ€™s sophomore album.
POPULAR
Just one month after announcing their new full-length studio albumÂ TalkerÂ â€“ due out September 20th viaÂ Bright Antenna RecordsÂ â€“ Tulsa, Oklahomaâ€™s Wilderado â€“ Max Rainer (lead singer, guitarist), Tyler Wimpee (guitarist, vocals), Justin Kila (drums) â€“ release the melancholic stunner â€œBad Luck."
When asked about this latest single Rainer shared,Â â€œâ€˜Bad Luckâ€™ is one of my favorite songs on the record. One of the reasons is because of how little we edited it. Itâ€™s straight through on the drums, straight through on the guitars and same for the vocals. It has an immediacy that never leaves. The track felt like a safe place for pessimism and the reality that growing older kind of sucks. I felt like saying weâ€™ve all got bad luck and things only get harder, however every once in a while you find a lover and a hotel. Maybe weâ€™re living between moments of happiness, disbelief and secrets, but weâ€™re getting by.â€�
â€œBad Luckâ€� is the fifth single to drop ahead ofÂ TalkerÂ â€“ the bandâ€™s sophomore album which was recorded in Norman, Oklahoma, and produced byÂ Chad CopelinÂ (Sufjan Stevens,Â SYML) andÂ James McAlisterÂ (Gracie Abrams,Â The National). In May Wilderado released the acoustic tinged title track â€œTalkerâ€� with news of the LP and prior to that was the double single â€œSometimesâ€� b/w â€œTomorrowâ€� in March and at the end of 2023 they released â€œIn Betweenâ€� â€“ a single that saw several alternate versions, one featuring guest vocals fromÂ Matt BerningerÂ ofÂ The NationalÂ and one with a few fellow Oklahomans including folk/Americana artistÂ Ken PomeroyÂ on vocal and guitar andÂ Muskrat JonesÂ (Colter Wall) on pedal steel.
The band also announced a fall headline tour with the album last month, extending their extensive Spring and Summer run through the end of October. In addition to playing mostly sold-out headline dates, Wilderado will be playingÂ LollapaloozaÂ in August and theÂ Bristol Rhythm & Roots ReunionÂ Festival in September. The current stretch of confirmed dates will culminate with a headline show in their hometown atÂ Cainâ€™s BallroomÂ on October 26th with direct support fromÂ Josiah & The Bonnevilles.
Wilderadoâ€™s expansive indie rock fuses soaring vocals and rumbling guitars with an open-road, Americana-inspired feel. Since first forming, they have been steadily building a passionate fan base, accruingÂ 200+ MILLIONÂ streams andÂ 3+ MILLIONÂ monthly listeners across platforms and their live following has continued to grow each year.Â TalkerÂ will follow the bandâ€™s self-titled debut full-length that was released in October 2021 via Bright Antenna Records and led to their Late Night TV Debut onÂ Jimmy Kimmel Live!Â and AM TV Debut onÂ CBS Saturday Morning. Spring 2023 had Wilderado touring withÂ My Morning JacketÂ and releasingÂ Wilderado LiveÂ â€“ their first ever live LP featuring career spanning songs including â€œSurefireâ€� and â€œHead Rightâ€� (two Top 10 Alt Radio hits from Wilderado) along with several older songs including â€œWheatâ€� and â€œMorning Lightâ€� as well as fan favorite â€œRubble to Rubble.â€� For the most up-to-date information visit:Â https://www.wilderado.co/.
