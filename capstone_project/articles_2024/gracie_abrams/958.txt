Paul Mescal and Gracie Abrams know all too well about what a summer of love entails.
In between their busy schedules — he worked on the blockbuster film Gladiator II while Abrams opened for Taylor Swift on the Eras tour — the pair appeared to find time to make a special connection.
Both Mescal and Abrams sparked romance rumors in June 2024 when they were spotted enjoying a meal in London. In the months that followed, the pair convinced fans that they are more than just friends.
While the actor and singer have yet to go Instagram official or walk a red carpet together, there are plenty of moments that suggest something special is brewing with the twosome.
Keep reading to see how this private bond seemingly unfolded into a special love story:

Let the romance rumors begin! TMZ obtained photos of both Mescal and Abrams enjoying a meal together at BRAT Restaurant in London. In one picture, the actor reached over during the meal and stroked Abram’s cheek.
In a profile for The Sunday Times, Abrams addressed the interest in her personal life. “It’s all spooky,” she said. “You hope for just privacy in your life as anyone else would. That’s just the truth.”
Two months after first being spotted, Mescal and Abrams were photographed together again in London. This time, however, they were captured holding hands. According to the Daily Mail, the duo enjoyed a shopping trip before attending the All Points East Music Festival. While enjoying Mitski’s set, the pair were joined by Mescal’s Normal People costar Daisy Edgar-Jones and her boyfriend, Ben Seed.
When kicking off The Secret of Us tour, Abrams received some support from Mescal in the audience on October 5. According to People, the actor showed up at Radio City Music Hall in New York City to witness his rumored girlfriend’s set. And yes, he was spotted dancing and singing along to her performance.
Less than one week later, Mescal expressed his hopes that he can keep his personal life a bit more private. In an interview with GQ, the actor said that he’s “learned that there’s certain lines in the sand now for me that just are going to be impenetrable for the benefit of my own sanity.”
“The speculation has been kind of mad for the last x amount of years,” Mescal added about his relationship status. “I’m not comfortable inviting any access into that part of my life. How I am in my private life is so precious to me because I get very little of it, and it might be public interest, but it’s not public-obligated information.”
Swifties spotted Mescal attending Swift’s Eras tour on October 20 to watch Abrams’ opening set at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida. He seemingly watched the show from one of the private VIP sections on the floor of the stadium. Because there were no tent covers on the VIP suites in Miami, fans have a better view of who was in attendance.

Abrams supported Mescal at the Los Angeles premiere of his movie Gladiator II, according to social media footage. They were also seen hugging at the official afterparty.
They made their respective Saturday Night Live debuts one week apart. Mescal hosted the December 7 episode, while Abrams served as the musical guest one week later. After Abrams’ December 14 performance, they were spotted holding hands in New York City.
Days later, Abrams made a rare comment about her private life. “Abrams keeps it brief when I ask how she’s found navigating personal relationships under this new public microscope,” Nylon’s Lauren McCarthy wrote in an interview published on December 17. “‘That has nothing to do with me,’ she says, straight-faced. ‘It doesn’t affect me.’”
