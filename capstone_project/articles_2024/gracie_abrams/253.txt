Gracie Abrams just said goodbye to the Eras Tour, but next year she’ll be headlining shows herself.
She’s just announced The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour, which kicks off July 14 at TD Garden in Boston and will see the “That’s So True” artist performing at New York’s Madison Square Garden, Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre and other iconic venues. Only five dates have been announced, but it’s likely more will follow.
You can sign up now to access the artist presale that starts Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time. The general sale begins Dec. 13 at 10 a.m. local time via gracieabrams.com. VIP packages are also available via vipnation.com.
The North American dates follow Gracie’s European and Asian tour dates, which start Feb. 8 in Madrid and wrap up April 19 in Bangkok, Thailand.
Meanwhile, Gracie is also up for a Grammy for her duet with Taylor Swift, “Us.” On Dec. 14, she’ll make her Saturday Night Live debut.
