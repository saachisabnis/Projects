Pop superstar Taylor Swift addressed her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, making a surprise appearance on stage during the final night of her three 'Eras Tour' concerts in London this past weekend.
"Iâ€™m still cracking up/swooning overÂ @killatravâ€™s Eras Tour debut ðŸ¥° Never going to forget these shows. Canâ€™t wait to do it 5 more times in August," Swift wrote in a lengthy Instagram post in which she also mentioned Paramore singer Hayley Williams and Gracie Abrams, both of whom also made surprise appearances and performed on stage during the weekend London shows.
Kelce, wearing a top hat and costume, acted out a skit with Swift and her backup dancers where he applied makeup to her and later carried her onto a red couch before attempting to revive her during her performance of 'I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.'
Kelce was joined by his brother, recently retired former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, and sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, as well as numerous other celebrities during Swift's 'Eras Tour' shows in London this weekend.
Swift also shared a photo of herself and Kelce alongside Prince William, his son, Prince George and his daughter, Princess Charlotte, while in London this weekend.
Swift and Kelce initially went public with their relationship when she attended his game against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium last September. The three-time Super Bowl champion famously revealed that he attempted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number when he attended her concert at Arrowhead Stadium prior to their relationship last summer.
Swift later said that Kelce "very adorably put me on blast" when he acknowledged the situation on his New Heights podcast, which she said "was metal as hell" while being featured as Time Magazine's 'Person of the Year' in December 2023.
