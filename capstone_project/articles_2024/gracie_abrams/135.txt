About
Gracie Abrams just finished her run as opening act for Taylor Swift’s historic The Eras Tour, and is capitalizing on that newfound level of superstardom by announcing a headlining arena tour of her own in 2025. Abrams made the tour reveal on Instagram on Monday (December 9), which includes the biggest headlining shows of the pop star’s breakout career. The Secret of Us Deluxe Tour – which features opening act Role Model – is in support of the expanded edition of Abrams’ Billboard No. 2 charting sophomore album. The jaunt gets underway on July 24 at the TD Garden in Boston, with other high-profile dates on the brief 6-show tour including a Madison Square Garden performance on July 28, a gig at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on August 6, and an outdoor show at Colorado’s legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater on August 11, along with two international shows in Toronto and Mexico City. Abrams will also be the musical guest on the upcoming December 14 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Chris Rock. (Variety)
