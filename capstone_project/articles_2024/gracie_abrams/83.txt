Saturday Night Live has secured its last three hosts and musical guests for 2024. On Monday, the NBC comedy variety show announced that Gracie Abrams and Hozier will perform on the Dec. 14 and Dec. 21 episodes of the show to end the year. Chris Rock and Martin Short will host the shows, respectively.

	Abrams simply wrote, “AHH😭😭😭,” as she shared the news on her Instagram.

	The SNL performances will conclude massive years for both artists: Abrams released her album The Secret of Us and toured with Taylor Swift on the Eras Tour, while Hozier released a TikTok and radio-staple “Too Sweet” on his album Unreal Unearth last year.

	The final two 2024 shows follow the Paul Mescal-hosted episode on Saturday, where Shaboozey will perform after making chart history with his song “Bar Song (Tipsy),” which tied Lil Nas X’s record for most weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100.

	Hozier is coming off the heels of his massive tour for Unreal Unearth, which wrapped in New Zealand in late November. Abrams will also wrap her run with Swift’s Eras Tour this weekend in Vancouver.

	Rock will return to 30 Rock after being a cast member from 1990 to 1993. He joined the 40th-anniversary special in 2015 to introduce Eddie Murphy. With his episode, Martin Short will officially join the SNL Five-Timers Club after hosting four times before, including once last season.

	The episodes come in the middle of SNL‘s 50th anniversary season, which will end with a primetime special on Feb. 16. So far this season, Saturday Night Live has featured musical guests such as Billie Eilish, Stevie Nicks, Coldplay, Mk.gee, Chappell Roan, and Jelly Roll.
