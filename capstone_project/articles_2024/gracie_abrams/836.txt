Gracie Abrams, whom Uproxx recently profiled, cracked the pop zeitgeist with The Secret Of Us, her sophomore full-length album that became her first-ever No. 1 on the UK’s Official Albums Chart and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Abrams already jetted overseas to perform “Us” with Taylor Swift during the latter’s The Eras Tour stop at London’s Wembley Stadium, and she just confirmed her return to Europe and the UK as a headliner.
“THE SECRET OF US TOUR – EUROPE/UK ’25!!!!!!” Abrams captioned an Instagram post on Monday morning, July 15. “I cannot wait to see you.”
