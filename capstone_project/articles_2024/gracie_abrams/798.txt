The Cure have triumphantly returned to the top of the charts with their first number one album in 32 years, Songs Of A Lost World. 
The iconic English rock band, featuring Robert Smith, Simon Gallup, Roger O’Donnell, Perry Bamonte, Jason Cooper and Reeves Gabrels, achieved their last UK chart-topping success with the 1992 album Wish. Their latest release, which comes 16 years after their previous album, has not only topped the chart but also outsold the rest of the top five combined, as reported by the Official Charts Company. 
In light of this remarkable comeback, frontman Smith expressed his gratitude: "It is enormously uplifting, genuinely heart-warming to experience such a wonderful reaction to the release of the new Cure album." He also extended thanks to the fans: "To everyone who has bought it, listened to it, loved it, believed in us over the years – thank you."
Additionally, the album has dominated the Official Vinyl Albums Chart and the Official Record Store Chart, making it the most sought-after album in independent UK record shops over the past week. This resurgence of interest has also seen The Cure's 2001 Greatest Hits compilation climb to number 30 on the charts. Since forming in 1978, The Cure has sold over 30 million albums globally, headlined Glastonbury Festival four times, and was honoured with an induction into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. 
In other music news, Sabrina Carpenter's sixth album 'Short n’ Sweet' has risen one place to number two, while US rapper Tyler, the Creator’s eighth offering 'Chromakopia' has slipped two places to third. Charli XCX's summer hit 'Brat' has climbed one spot to fourth and Ed Sheeran’s '+–=÷× (Tour Collection)' record has leapt seven places to fifth following its physical release.
On the UK singles chart, US star Gracie Abrams, currently supporting Taylor Swift on her US Eras Tour, has bagged her first UK number one single with 'That’s So True'. The break up anthem was in a tight race with 'Sailor Song' by US singer Gigi Perez, but Abrams secured victory by fewer than 1,200 chart units.
Bruno Mars and Blackpink’s Rose's collaboration 'Apt' takes third place, Abrams also secures fourth place with 'I Love You I’m Sorry', and pop sensation Chappell Roan rounds out the top five with 'Hot To Go'.
