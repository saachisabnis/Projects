Singer Victoria Monét and her boyfriend, John Gaines, have always prioritized their little family.
After keeping a low-profile early in their romance, the duo announced in December 2020 that they were expecting their first baby. They welcomed daughter Hazel in February 2021.
“We’re completely in love and enjoying our new chapter,” Monét said in a September 2021 interview with Essence. “[Hazel has] really got him wrapped around her finger, and I’ve seen him change in ways that I know he didn’t expect. She’s growing us up.”
In February 2024, Monét brought Gaines and Hazel to the Grammys where she ended up taking home three awards including the coveted Best New Artist. Seven months later, the pair announced in a joint statement that they had quietly called it quits.
“We spent the last 10 months trying to respectfully and privately navigate the fact that we are no longer in a relationship. Though we still completely adore and respect each other, we are not a couple anymore,” the message shared via X read. “There was no infidelity, toxic behavior or drama. We both just have some fundamental growing to do that would best be done apart so we can remain the best versions of ourselves for our daughter.”
Keep scrolling for a look at Monét and Gaines’ love story over the years:
Gaines starred in the music video for Monét’s song “Moment.” While it’s unclear whether the twosome were already romantically involved at the time, they shared some seriously steamy kisses in the video.
Gaines shared his partner’s pregnancy news via Instagram.
“I have been blessed to do a lot of great things, but this is by far the greatest. Baby Gaines coming 2021!!!” the fitness trainer wrote. “@Victoriamonet words can’t express how proud I am to be on this journey with you. Since day one you have handled this with so much poise and grace. You are a strong, beautiful, loving, and caring woman. We are both blessed to have you and I can’t wait to make memories with our family.”
The couple announced that they had welcomed daughter Hazel.
“I love you @victoriamonet. Thank you for the best early birthday gift I could ask for. #girldad,” Gaines captioned an Instagram photo of the newborn’s hand wrapped around Monét’s finger.
Gaines shared a snap of the family of three to commemorate Monét’s birthday.
“This weekend we celebrate you!!! @thebabymonet and I love you, and are so proud of you. Now let’s turn up!!!” he wrote in the caption.
“These smiles motivate me to be the best version of myself and I will strive to keep them on your faces forever 🤎#motivationmonday,” Gaines wrote alongside an adorable snap of Monét and Hazel.
While wishing Hazel a happy 2nd birthday via Instagram, Gaines also praised Monét for being “an amazing partner, mother, and example of a woman for Hazel.”
Gaines wished the musician a happy Mother’s Day via Instagram.
“I couldn’t ask for a better example of a woman for @itshazelmonet to follow. You’re killing this mom thing my love. I’m proud of you and I love you,” he wrote.
Monét expressed her gratitude for Gaines in the comments section, writing, “I love you and I wouldn’t be half the mommy I am without you and all the ways you support me!🤎.”
While discussing her bisexuality during an appearance on Baltimore’s Radio One, Monét explained why her sexual orientation doesn’t make her more prone to infidelity.
“Whether I were dating a man or woman, I feel like it’s more so about the connection you have with each other and the trust that you have. Because even if I was going on a girls’ trip and I don’t like any of my quote-unquote friends, and I was doing something shady, there’s a guy that has to check us in the hotel,” she explained. “There’s, like, so many opportunities [for cheating]. It may not be one of my friends. It could be anybody I walk past.”
Monét then spoke to the trust that she and Gaines share.
“It’s really more so about the grounding you have at home and making sure that feels strong. There’s just trust there,” she said. “It doesn’t matter who in the world you come across, you know that I’m yours, and we trust each other.”
Monét and Gaines enjoyed a special outing with their daughter.
“A proud moment watching @itshazelmonet overcome fears and have a great time with the exotic animals at @zwfmiami,” Gaines captioned a series of the trio at the wildlife exhibit. “@victoriamonet got to be face to face with a Jaguar! Blessed to finish the year making a memory that will last forever.”

Monét walked the Grammys red carpet with Gaines and Hazel. The singer later joked to Entertainment Tonight that bringing the toddler to the event was a “disaster.”
Monét and Gaines announced that they quietly broke up 10 months earlier. While they are no longer involved romantically, the twosome shared that their new priority is being amicable coparents.
“It simply didn’t work out and that’s OK. We still think the world of each other and operate with love in every interaction for our family,” their statement read. “We have an incredible daughter to raise for life and that is undoubtedly our No. 1 priority forever. No relationship status can remove or replace that fact. We are committed to doing the inner work and trust that God will place us both where we belong in due time.”
