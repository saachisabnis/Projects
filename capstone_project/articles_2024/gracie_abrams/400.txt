On the first of five nights at Wembley Stadium on The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift brought out surprise guest Ed Sheeran.
“We toured together on the Red tour. Every time I am doing the Red part of this show I think about the memories that we’ve made," Taylor Swift said to the crowd, before introducing Ed Sheeran, "And now he is someone who plays Wembley, like, every week. This is, like, regular for him. And he works so hard. And he’s on tour right now and he’s probably so tired, but he wanted to come and play for you and do this for all of us.”
During his appearance, Swift and Sheeran performed a mashup of their 2012 duet “Everything Has Changed,” as well as Swift's “End Game,” and Sheeran's “Thinking Out Loud.”
During her first run of London shows from 21-23 June at Wembley Stadium, Swift announced Griff, METTE and Benson Boone as the openers who took to the stage before Paramore who have joined Taylor Swift on the entirety of the EU/UK tour. For the second run of shows, she has added RAYE, Suki Waterhouse, Holly Humberstone, Maisie Peters and Sofia Isella.
The final UK dates on The Eras Tour take place from 15-17 and 19-20 August before Swift returns to the US for the next leg which will see Gracie Abrams as main support.
The Eras Tour comes to an end on 8 December in Vancouver.
