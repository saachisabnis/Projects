Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams are proving that they are not only impressive musicians but also a chaotic duo together as a late-night songwriting session somehow devolved into them having to put out a small kitchen fire.
Abrams took to her Instagram on Friday (June 21) to share a couple videos of her and The Tortured Poets Department singer hanging out and writing a song together in the middle of the night, documenting the creative process of finding the right lyrics and melody. While the first clip showed the pair excitedly bouncing ideas off each other, the second clip took the chaos to the next level as they were faced with a small fire in the kitchen. 
In the clip, the "I miss you, I'm sorry" singer laughs as she films the flames while Swift, who calmly stated "I think we're gonna die," grabbed a fire extinguisher to douse the blaze. The Midnights musician, however, had a difficult time getting the extinguisher to work, struggling and voicing her frustrations as Abrams continued to laugh. She eventually got it to work and was able to put on the flames with a bit more force than they were expecting, but not without some collateral damage. 
"Our purses are ruined. And my shoes. And the whole room I think," Swift said, holding back laughter.
Despite the unexpected fire escapades, they appeared to have a great time.
"Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life," Abrams captioned the post, tagging Swift and adding, "now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you."
