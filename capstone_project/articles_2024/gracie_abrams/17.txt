The first night of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in New Orleans was a star-studded event.
Eagle-eyed Swifties were quick to spot a number of celebrities who traveled to the Crescent City to watch Swift and Gracie Abrams perform inside the Caesars Superdome. Both singers evoked their love for the Big Easy while chatting with fans in between songs.
Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds were seen on the floor, which is no surprise given the couple is in Swift's inner circle and are often with her when she travels.Â

"Hunger Games" star Josh Hutcherson was there Friday night, wearing a gold button down and lots of friendship bracelets. Videos circulating on X show him trading his Swift swag with other fans in the Dome.Â

Camilla Luddington, who plays Jo on "Grey's Anatomy," was also in attendance.
There's still more time for A-listers to make their way to New Orleans for a concert. We're hoping to see Lana Del Rey, Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Amy SchumerÂ â€” all of whom have Louisiana tiesÂ â€” in the Superdome.Â
