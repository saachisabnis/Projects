Peso Pluma is debuting at No. 5 on this week’s Billboard 200 with Éxodo.
The project earns 64,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with nearly all of the units credited to streaming equivalent album units and equaling to 87.51 million on-demand streams of the songs. The album sales and track equivalent album units comprise under 1,000 units combined as the record was only available as a digital download. This marks Pluma’s second top five effort following the No. 3 peak of Genesis in 2023.
Also debuting this week is Gracie Abrams at No. 2 with The Secret of Us, earning 89,000 equivalent album units including 50,000 in album sales, 38,000 in streaming equivalent album units (47.57 million on-demand streams of the songs) and 1,000 in track equivalent album units. Her second studio effort gives Abrams her highest-charting album so far and her best week by units.
Elsewhere on the chart is Taylor Swift at No. 1 for her 10th week, Morgan Wallen at No. 3 and Billie Eilish at No. 4. Making up the bottom half of this week’s top 10 is Chappell Roan, which enters a new peak of No. 6, Wallen again at No. 7, Ariana Grande at No. 8, Charli XCX at No. 9 and Shaboozey at No. 10.
