Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is nearly over, and this weekend, the final U.S. stop takes place in Indianapolis, Indiana: Swift will be playing three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium, starting tomorrow night, with an opening act by Gracie Abrams.
The stadium shares on their website that "There are no listening areas or tailgating outside of the stadium for those guests without concert tickets," so only plan to show up if you have a ticket. But if you have your friendship bracelets made and are still searching for tickets, you're in luck: Prices have begun to fall on resale sites.
For each of the three nights in Indianapolis, here's what we're seeing online on resale platforms StubHub, SeatGeek, and Vivid Seats. (As a note, there are currently no tickets available on Ticketmaster's resale platform, but we recommend refreshing as the show gets closer, as on occasion, they will drop tickets.)
