It's the end of an era for Taylor Swift.
The "Fortnight" singer broke her silence following the end of her record-breaking Eras Tour, which concluded Sunday (December 8) in Vancouver after nearly two years of performing all around the world. Swift took to her Instagram on Wednesday to reminisce about the history-making tour and share several photos from the stage, posing her backup dancers and performing with special guests like Gracie Abrams.
"It was rare. I was there. I remember it," she captioned the photos, referencing lyrics from her fan-favorite song "All Too Well."
While the Eras Tour wrap-up post would make any Swiftie nostalgic, one photo in particular confirmed a longstanding fan theory, per People. In one shot, Swift can be seen sitting inside the infamous "cleaning cart" fans speculated that she used to travel to the stage throughout the tour, confirming that she did indeed travel inside the enclosed cart. 
Wearing her bejeweled Lover-era bodysuit, Swift gave fans a look inside the cart, which contained a chair for her to sit comfortably during transport, framed artwork, including what looks like a painting of Cardiff Bay in Wales, and other notes taped to the side, including a sign dedicated to her cats Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button. 
Following the conclusion of the long-running tour, Swift made sure to show her gratitude toward in crew for all of the hard work they put in for the 149 shows, gifting them nearly $200 million in bonuses.
