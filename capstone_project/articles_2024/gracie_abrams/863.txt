It's an emotional time for Taylor Swift as her massive, worldwide "Eras Tour" is almost over. The pop superstar is opening up about how she's feeling in a new post after just wrapping up her six shows in Toronto.
Alongside several photos from her Toronto shows, she shared that she loved getting to perform in Canada "after so much time," explaining, "As always, the fans in Toronto treated us like it was a hometown show. Couldn't have asked for more love or generosity from the people who came out."
Swift also reflected on performing alongside Gracie Abrams, who was recently nominated for a Grammy for "Us" — which features Taylor — for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, as they sang mashup of the song with Swift's "Out of the Woods," saying that "I just adore her. She's been giving the most amazing performances every night on this tour!!"
Taylor added as they are nearing the end of "The Era's Tour" with only one more city left (Vancouver), "The emotions have gotten pretty heightened for me and the rest of the team because it’s gotten extremely real for us: Our next city will be the last one of The Eras Tour, and the closing of the most extraordinary chapter of my life so far."
