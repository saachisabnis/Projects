	A new Lorde musical era seems to be on the horizon.

	Producer Jim-E Stack — who has worked with artists including Gracie Abrams, Bon Iver, Dominic Fike, Joji, The Kid LAROI and more — took to Instagram to share a photo of the “Green Light” singer sitting in the studio, working on her laptop. The cryptic post doesn’t have a caption.

	The post comes just a week after Lorde completely wiped her social media accounts, leading fans to believe that a new album is on the way. Her bio now reads: “THE THEMES ARE ALWAYS THE SAME— A RETURN TO INNOCENCE— THE MYSTERIES OF THE BLOOD— AN ITCH FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL.”

	Lorde has been teasing her follow-up to 2021’s Solar Power for almost a year now, and recently she posted a brief few seconds of what appears to be new music, alongside a snap of Lorde in the studio, smiling as she rocked her head side-to-side to the techno-leaning instrumental beat. The caption to the post read, “will be back in touch.”

	










	In June, the star posted a number of cryptic pictures, writing “use the existing tools wherever possible” alongside a variety of images including a copyright symbol, three variations of the letter L, the number four in parentheses and a recycling logo.
