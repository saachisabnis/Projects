Taylor Swift is singing the praises of Eras Tour opener Gracie Abrams. In a post reflecting on her six-show run in Toronto, the pop superstar gushed about how fans in Canada’s biggest city treated the concerts like they were a “hometown show” before turning her attention to the “That’s So True” singer, who has opened for her in the North American leg of the tour running October through early December.

	“I got to play a mashup of the Grammy nominated song ‘us’ with @gracieabrams, mashed up with ‘Out of the Woods’ and I just adore her,” Swift captioned her Instagram carousel on Tuesday (Nov. 26), which included a photo of the two taking the stage together, as well as another of them hugging. “She’s been giving the most amazing performances every night on this tour!!” The two women penned Abrams’ “Us” alongside Aaron Dessner, and the track is up for the best pop duo/group performance at the 2025 Grammys.

	Swift then looked ahead to the final three shows of her Eras Tour, which will take place in Vancouver, B.C., beginning Dec. 6. “The emotions have gotten pretty heightened for me and the rest of the team because it’s gotten extremely real for us: Our next city will be the last one of The Eras Tour, and the closing of the most extraordinary chapter of my life so far. See you 🔜 , Vancouver. We can’t wait to give you all we’ve got for three more shows,” she wrote, concluding with a smiling cry emoji.

	Two days earlier, Abrams also expressed her gratitude toward the Swifties who attended the Toronto shows. “I will never ever forget those six shows. You were so loud and so generous and so kind,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Sunday (Nov. 24). “Thank you for hanging out with us while we waited for @taylorswift who brought me to tears every single night the past two weekends…… Cassandra x mad woman x I did something bad forever good night.”

	The Eras Tour ends Dec. 8 at the BC Palace in Vancouver, B.C.
