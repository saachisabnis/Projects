On Friday, Gracie Abrams released her new album, The Secret of Us. And to mark the occasion, the 24-year-old pop star shared intimate Instagram videos of behind-the-scenes footage of her and Taylor Swift writing their new duet “Us,” as well a hilarious clip of Swift using a fire extinguisher to put out a small blaze in her apartment. Abrams captioned the post: “Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life. @taylorswift now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you.” 
Abrams recounted the incident to Billboard, saying she was surprised that Swift could function since they were up late writing “Us,” a key track on The Secret of Us. “She was such a legend—I don’t know how at this hour or in our state she knew what to do,” Abrams recalled. “We both had an insane cough from the fire extinguisher fumes for weeks.” (Complex)
