	Taylor Swift unveiled her The Tortured Poets Department double album on Friday night (April 19), and it’s already one of the year’s top albums.

	In less than 12 hours, Swift’s 11th studio album has become Spotify’s most streamed album in a single day in 2024 so far, Spotify confirmed to Billboard. The project is also her first album of new music since 2022’s Grammy-winning Midnights. Swift’s new LP features collaborations with Florence + the Machine and Post Malone, as well as writing and production contributions from Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner. On Thursday (April 18), Swift revealed that the Post Malone-assisted “Fortnight” would serve as the set’s first single, with a music video to follow on Friday (April 19) at 8 p.m. ET.

	Beyond support from Swifties, the superstar’s famous friends and supporters immediately flooded social media with love for The Tortured Poets Department, with her “Karma” remix collaborator Ice Spice sharing an Instagram Story with the volume turned up on her speakers as she listened to the album. Meanwhile, Sophie Turner showed love for the track “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”
