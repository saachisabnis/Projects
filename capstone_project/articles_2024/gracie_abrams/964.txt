After the turkey’s been eaten, the parade has ended and the football teams have gone home, it’s time to get out your turntable. This year’s Record Store Day Black Friday takes place Nov. 29, with cool vinyls for you from Noah Kahan, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Teddy Swims.
For the most recent Record Store Day in April, Noah and Olivia teamed up for a split 7-inch single. This time, they have their own releases. Noah’s is Town Hall (Stick Season Collaborations), a standalone LP on tiger eye brown vinyl that includes all eight duet tracks from Stick Season (We’ll All Be Here Forever). Among them: “Dial Drunk” with Post Malone, “Northern Attitude” with Hozier and “Everywhere, Everything” with Gracie Abrams.
Olivia’s is GUTS (spilled), a two-LP set pressed on red-and-purple marble vinyl that includes all the songs on the original GUTS album, plus the five additional songs released on the GUTS (spilled) edition, including “obsessed” and “so american.”
Billie has HIT ME HARD AND SOFT [Isolated vocals], a version of her current album with just the vocal tracks from the songs.
Teddy is offering I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1.5), pressed on baby blue vinyl. This expanded edition of his debut album features four extra songs, which are making their vinyl debuts.
The 2024 Record Store Day Black Friday event will also feature releases by Bebe Rexha, Whitney Houston, OneRepublic, Lauren Spencer Smith and even Daniel Powter, the dude with that one hit, “Bad Day.”
