Miley Cyrus joked that she 'might have forgotten underwear' during her speech after winning Record of the Year for the track, Flowers, during the 2024 Grammys on Sunday. 
The songstress, 31 - who notably was the recipient of two Grammys at the glitzy event - also dressed to impress in a whopping total of five, flesh-flashing ensembles at the ceremony held at the Crypto.com Arena in L.A. 
While accepting the award for Record of the Year, the beauty took to the stage wearing an eye-catching, brown dress. 
Towards the end of her speech, Cyrus gave a shout out to those who had collaborated on the hit song - such as her team. 
She then humorously concluded with, 'I don't think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear.'

Also on stage while celebrating her second win during the special night, Miley expressed, 'Thank you all so much! This award is amazing. But I really hope that it does not change anything. Because my life was beautiful yesterday.'
'Not everyone in the world will get a Grammy, but everyone in this world is spectacular, so please don't think that this is important. Even though it's very important, right, guys?' she said, glancing back at the others standing behind her.
Other artists that were competing in the category included Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, SZA, Olivia Rodrigo, Victoria Monet, boygenius and Jon Batiste. 
'We are very excited,' the hitmaker continued, and gave a sweet shoutout to her loved ones,' adding, 'My mommy, my sister, my love...'
Both her mother, Tish Cyrus, as well as older sister, Brandi, were in attendance at the ceremony. Her boyfriend, Maxx Morando, was also at the event to support the singer.
The star turned heads during the speech wearing a one-shoulder, dark brown dress that was made of a shimmering, sequin material that glittered under the bright lights. 
A thigh-high slit could be seen on the left portion of the ensemble, offering a sultry flare to the stylish look. 
She slipped into a pair of sleek, brown heels to coincide with the color scheme and at one point during the night, Cyrus was also seen holding a fuzzy, brown jacket to pair with the gown.
