	Her hit single “Taste” has now spent seven consecutive weeks at the top in the U.K., and when you add that to the No. 1 runs of her previous singles “Espresso” (seven non-consecutive weeks) and “Please Please Please” (five non-consecutive weeks), the pint-sized pop star has officially racked up 19 weeks at No. 1 in 2024.

	That’s not just any record—Sabrina has now overtaken the legendary Olivia Newton-John, who held the record with 16 weeks at No. 1 back in 1978. 

	As if that weren’t enough, she’s also tied with Ed Sheeran for the most weeks at No. 1 in a single year this century. Sheeran also hit 19 weeks in 2021 with tracks like “Bad Habits,” “Shivers,” and his Christmas collaborations with Elton John and LadBaby.

	“Taste” is proving to be irresistible, pulling in over 6 million streams this week alone, making it the most-streamed song in the U.K. for the seventh straight week. It’s tied with Noah Kahan’s “Stick Season” for the longest-running No. 1 of 2024, and with no major competition on the horizon, Sabrina’s reign could stretch even further.

	Elsewhere on the charts, things are getting interesting. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ mid-career hit “Die With A Smile” is surging, climbing to a brand-new peak of No. 3. It’s their highest-charting song in the U.K. in years, proving they’ve still got it. 

	Meanwhile, Gigi Perez scores her first-ever Top 10 hit with “Sailor Song,” which leaps five spots to No. 6 this week, earning a lot of buzz in the process.

	Sonny Fodera, Jazzy, and D.O.D.’s summer anthem “Somedays” is still heating up, jumping two places to land at a new peak of No. 8, while Gracie Abrams is edging closer to her first U.K. Top 10 with “I Love You, I’m Sorry,” which skyrockets eight spots to No. 11. 

	Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” is also making a move, rising four places to No. 13.

	Not to be outdone, KSI and Trippie Redd make a big splash with their latest single “Thick Of It,” which debuts at No. 14, marking KSI’s 19th Top 40 single and Trippie Redd’s second. Meanwhile, Addison Rae is continuing her rise in the pop world, as her track “Diet Pepsi” cruises up seven spots to No. 15, marking her first-ever U.K. Top 20 hit.

	










	Rounding out the Top 20, Coldplay makes a strong return with “FeelsLikeImFallingInLove” re-entering the charts at No. 18 after a 13-week absence, thanks to the release of their new project Moon Music. Their track “We Pray” also hits a new peak at No. 20.

	With three massive No. 1 hits and 19 record-breaking weeks at the top, Sabrina Carpenter is officially unstoppable. Her taste for chart domination shows no signs of slowing down, and it’s clear that 2024 is shaping up to be her year. 

	The question now is, can anyone knock her off the top?
