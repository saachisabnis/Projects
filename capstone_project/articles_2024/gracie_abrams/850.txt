London
Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch were among the guests who surprised crowds across eight nights in Wembley Stadium
Since the Eras tour began last March, it’s been through a lot of changes. When the Tortured Poet’s Department came out it had an entire set added to the show at the expense of Evermore (still not over it), and, of course, every night Taylor plays two exclusive surprise songs, many of which have become mashups ever since Australia. 
The surprise set is both the most exciting and nerve-wracking part of the show. You could get your absolute favourite song of all time, or you could get the acoustic version of ‘ME!’, and there’s no way to know which way it’s going to go until it happens. If you’re really lucky, you might even get a guest or the ever-elusive Reputation (Taylor’s Version) announcement. Originally, Taylor said she wasn’t going to repeat any of these tracks, but she’s since thrown this rule out, so it is truly unpredictable now.
Taylor’s really treated her London crowds. On the first night (August 15) Ed Sheeran popped in to play their collabs ‘Everything Has Changed’ and ‘End Game’ as well as a snippet of ‘Thinking Out Loud’. At the second show (August 16) she played ‘London Boy’ and a medley of ‘Dear John’ and ‘Sad, Beautiful Tragic’, and at the third (August 17) she played ‘I Did Something Bad’ and ‘My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys/Coney Island’. Back in June she was joined by Gracie Abrams and Hayley Williams during the surprise set.
On her final two nights, she played a mashup of ‘Long Live’, a fan favourite which was on the setlist before being removed to make room for the Tortured Poet's Department set, and ‘Change’, and one of ‘the Archer’ and ‘You’re on Your Own, Kid'. Fun fact: ‘You're on Your Own, Kid’ has been played as a surprise song more than any other on the tour.
Finally, Taylor brought Jack Antonoff onstage to play ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts’ and ‘Getaway Car’, and they even referenced the viral video of the pair creating the song. Finally, she rounded out the London surprise songs with, very appropriately, ‘So Long, London’.
On August 20, Florence Welch also surprised fans by joining in with a fully choreographed rendition of ‘Florida!!!’ during the Tortured Poet's set.
At the end of the Wembley dates, both of Taylor's songs with London in the title – ‘London Boy’ and ‘So Long, London’ – made an appearance. She also has a few other songs which feature London, which you can learn about here.
Although Taylor did pull a few tricks out of her top-hat, the setlist remained largely unchanged from the singer’s European dates. This is what you can expect to hear without a doubt if you catch her at Wembley this August.

Surprise songs
A few songs are yet to make the cut as of August 7. They are: 
Some fans speculated that ‘I Did Something Bad’ was being saved for the announcement of Reputation (Taylor's Version). However, that tune was played on August 17 and the new record wasn’t announced.
Additionally, it’s unlikely that Taylor will play ‘Ronan’ without Maya Thompson, whose blogs about her son’s battle with cancer inspired the track, present to honour his memory.
