On her debut solo album, the BLACKPINK singer sheds her armour, revealing a more vulnerable side behind the polished pop powerhouse
For most of her career, Rosé has been a study in polish: one-fourth of BLACKPINK, a pop phenomenon defined by its bold energy, glossy visuals, and unapologetic confidence. But on ‘Rosie’, the singer’s debut full-length album, Rosé peels back the layers of K-pop sheen to reveal a quieter, more vulnerable version of herself.
The album marks a departure from the meticulously crafted world she’s inhabited for more than a decade, offering a glimpse into her identity — not as the global superstar Rosé, but as Rosie, the sweetheart of your city, a twentysomething whose heart gets broken by boys too.
This transformation begins with the album’s opener, ‘Number One Girl’, a piano ballad born from sleepless nights spent doomscrolling through social media comments. The song captures her insecurities in vivid detail: the longing to feel special, the pressure to meet fan expectations, and the ache of wondering if she ever truly measures up. It’s a striking introduction to an album that largely trades K-pop’s grandeur for intimate songwriting and emotional candour.
At its core, ‘Rosie’ is a breakup album. Heartache, loss, anger, and desire simmer in its 12 tracks, capturing the messy, emotional spectrum of love in your twenties. While these themes are well-trodden ground for diaristic pop artists like Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and Gracie Abrams – women who turn their pens inward – for Rosé, this level of vulnerability feels like new terrain.
As a member of BLACKPINK, Rosé has long embodied an image of unshakeable strength, a carefully curated persona that left little room for fragility. But on ‘Rosie’, she sheds that armour, exposing her flaws with disarming openness.
Take ‘Toxic Till The End’, for instance: the pop track captures the turbulence of an on-again, off-again toxic relationship inspired by her own experiences. Here, Rosé candidly positions herself not just as the victim but as a willing participant in the cycle of frustration. On the breezy ‘3am’, she playfully admits, “I just saw a red flag / Gonna pretend I didn’t see that.” It’s in moments like these, where self-awareness meets humour, that Rosé truly shines as a songwriter. She isn’t merely reflecting on her heartache; she’s confronting her role in the dysfunction.
One of the most notable aspects of ‘Rosie’ is the way Rosé wields her voice, dancing between contrasts. Her willowy tone, which has always anchored the diverse elements of BLACKPINK, now uncovers new depths and versatility. On ‘Drinks Or Coffee’, she adopts a flirtatious tone that feels as light as the Afrobeats-inspired rhythms that underlie the standout track. The punchy energy of ‘APT.’, the album’s breakout hit featuring Bruno Mars, allows her voice to cut through with a playful, pop-punk attitude. Then there’s ‘Gameboy’, drenched in the warmth of early 2000s R&B, and the pretty piano ballad ‘Stay A Little Longer’, where her voice is at its most resonant, capturing both power and an aching sadness.
If you’re expecting more fun romps like “APT.”, ‘Rosie’ isn’t that. Instead, it’s an album steeped in balladry and strummy, sad-girl pop, each track a soft unraveling of her inner world. And yet, coming from Rosé – an artist who has long had to keep her personal life under wraps – this stripped-back approach feels nothing short of bold.
In fact, ‘Rosie’ opens with perhaps the most unguarded moment of the entire album: “Tell me that I’m special,” she sings in the first lines of ‘Number One Girl’. It’s a desperate plea from one of the world’s biggest pop stars, and yet, it’s such a human request. For an artist who has always been held at arm’s length by the public, ‘Rosie’ offers a rare and intimate invitation to understand Rosé as more than just a star — to see Rosie, the woman, searching for validation, love, and meaning.
In doing so, Rosé’s debut becomes a quiet but powerful declaration of self, marking the start of a new chapter that’s refreshingly honest and authentically hers.
The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.
