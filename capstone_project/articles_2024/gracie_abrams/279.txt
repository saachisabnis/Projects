It's not coincidental that the entertainment industry lives off of connections and family ties. Sometimes if a person wants to make it in Hollywood, it might just be a draw of being lucky enough to be born into a famous family. "Nepotism baby" has become a buzzword and refers to the rising stars in entertainment with famous parents who may or may not have played a role in their success. 
Here are some of the industry's most well-known "nepo babies" with an in-depth look into how their family has paved the way for them; or if they earned their fame on their own.
While she played a relatively low-key character on HBO's Euphoria, Maude Apatow has anything but a low-key upbringing. The daughter of actors Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow, Apatow has been vocal about being called a "nepotism baby."
"I try not to let it get to me because I obviously understand that I'm in such a lucky position," she continues, "A lot of people [in a similar position] have proven themselves over the years, so I've got to keep going and make good work. It's so early in my career, I don't have much to show yet, but hopefully, one day, I'll be really proud of the stuff I've done by myself."
Since her breakout role in season three of Netflix's hit show Stranger Things, Maya Hawke immediately raised comparisons to both her parents and how much she looks like either one.
On nepotism, Hawke has said that the opportunities she's been given aren't infinite and that "you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop. That's my ethos." She had a small role as one of Charles Manson's family members in the Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Her mother, Uma, was a long-time muse of Tarantino.
Lily Collins, who shares a name with her famous father, singer Phil Collins, made her film debut at the tender age of 2 in the BBC series Growing Pains. She later made her film debut alongside Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side. 
Like other famous children, Collins has dismissed the "nepo baby" label, saying, "It was out of the question that people would think that I use a free pass thanks to my name. I'm proud of my dad, but I wanted to be me, not just his daughter. For that, I was ready to wait to break through."
Reese Witherspoon's 19-year-old son recently made his television debut in the Netflix comedy Never Have I Ever.

Actor, model, and singer ZoÃ« Kravitz, daughter of actor Lisa Bonet and musician Lenny Kravitz have spoken up on nepotism, saying, "it's completely normal for people to be in the family business."

Jaden and Willow Smith, children of actor/musicians Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, have closely followed the path of fame together and separately.
Both siblings have appeared numerous times in films with their father. On being called a nepotism baby, Willow has expressed the sentiment, "If you love me, amazing. If you hate me, fantastic. That's none of my business."

For her role in Scream Queens, creator Ryan Murphy called her up and asked her to be on the show. 
The Boys star Jack Quaid once considered changing his last name to avoid comparison with his famous father, Dennis Quaid, or any association with his equally famous mother, Meg Ryan. 
The actor said, "I knew that people would constantly say, 'Oh, I know how he got that job, and they're still going to say that; it's fine." He even refused to use his father's agent to ensure that it was on his terms if he made it anywhere in Hollywood. 
Dakota Johnson has been in and out of sets since she was a child, thanks to her parents, actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith's work.

While all of Kris Jenner's children can be criticized for using nepotism to get ahead, Kendall Jenner has been one of the most vocal about the criticism. As one of the highest-paid models, Kendall has defended her success. 
"Everyone around me, whether it's friends or family, knows how hard I worked and how hard I still work [...] Of course, I had a platform, and I never took that for granted, but that almost made my job a little bit harder because people didn't want to hire me because I was on a reality show. I took my last name off of my modeling cards so that I was taken completely seriously."

Actor Cuba Gooding Jr's son Mason Gooding, began his acting career in 2017, finding a manager and agent and booking roles on his own.

And I thank him every day for giving me that sort of privilege."

I try to keep myself separate from it."

I know it's more difficult for them."
