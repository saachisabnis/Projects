Sabrina Carpenter has been “working late” as a singer, and the sweet reward has finally come. The “Feather”  crooner announced her sixth album, “Short n’ Sweet,” on Monday morning. The LP is set to drop Aug. 23. Carpenter also teased “a surprise” coming Thursday night.
“This project is quite special to me and i hope it’ll be something special to you too,” Carpenter wrote  across her social media accounts. 
Following the announcement, “sabrina” began trending on X. One fan account wrote, “sc6 already being the IT girl summer album with just one single and a teaser oh sabrina carpenter the woman you are!”

From Paris Hilton playing cornhole at Vampire Weekend’s set to No Doubt’s reunion, these are the best things our team saw at Coachella 2024.
Celebrities also shared their support for Carpenter’s new project, with “Abbott Elementary’s” Quinta Brunson and fellow Taylor Swift-opener Gracie Abrams celebrating in the singer’s Instagram comments. 
This announcement follows the success of her lead single, “Espresso,” which  has been hailed as the song of the summer. The  track remains a constant on the Billboard charts, staying atop the  Global chart for  more than a month, dethroning  Swift’s collaboration with Post Malone, “Fortnight,” and staying  steady  following the release of Billie Eilish’s  new album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft.”  “Espresso” is the second-most streamed song by a woman in 2024 and the former Disney star’s first No. 1 on the Billboard chart. 
Carpenter spent the latter half of 2023 and the first part of 2024 as the opener for Swift’s record-breaking  Eras tour. During her stint on the tour,  Carpenter earned her first top 40 hit on the Billboard chart with “Feather,” which also became her first No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart.

Sabrina Carpenter’s music video for “Feather” was shot in a Catholic church in New York City. The priest who allowed the filming was stripped of his administrative duties. 
The music video, which has amassed  more than 54 million views on YouTube, stirred controversy within the Catholic Church. Filmed in the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church in Brooklyn, N.Y., Carpenter’s fake funeral and short dress  “appalled” the Diocese of Brooklyn.  
The singer did not let the scandal phase her, joking that “Jesus was a Carpenter” — a phrase that  appeared on the singer’s shirt during her Coachella debut in April. The performance saw her streams increase by 41% during Coachella Weekend  1, Billboard reported.  
Fans have speculated that “Espresso” is about Carpenter’s boyfriend, Barry Keoghan. The pair  was first spotted together in December. Since then, the “Saltburn” actor has been seen supporting Carpenter at  Eras tour stops and Coachella.
