Katelyn Brown is reminiscing on sweet memories from 2024 as she looks ahead to a fresh year. She shared a recap of her year on Instagram, including heartwarming moments with her family and welcoming Baby No. 3.
Katelyn and her husband, award-winning artist Kane Brown, made a surprise announcement on Christmas Day in 2023. They posted a family photo to reveal that Katelyn was pregnant with the couple’s third child. Weeks later, they shared a gender reveal to announce that Baby No. 3 is the first boy of the family, joining big sisters Kingsley Rose, who turned 5 in October, and Kodi Jane, who turned 3 on Monday (December 30). The Browns used a cake to reveal blue cake inside. Baby No. 3, son Krewe Allen Brown, arrived on June 18.
