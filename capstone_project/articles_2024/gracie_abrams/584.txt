Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter roger weeks is thrilled to announce the release of his new single “MY OWN WAKE” along with its accompanying music video, co-directed by roger and Rose Betts. The single is now available on all major streaming services via If This Then Records.
“This song is all about radical acceptance. It’s about accepting exactly where you are in life even if it’s not pretty. It’s about letting life be a mess and still getting yourself together and celebrating life. After losing my mom, moving to LA, breaking up with my boyfriend, and ending up stronger than ever, I felt extremely powerful. I needed a song to represent that feeling so I wrote ‘MY OWN WAKE.’ This song isn’t just about acknowledging my imperfections, fears, losses, overwhelm, and insecurities… It’s about celebrating them,” says weeks.
roger weeks’ music journey began in the tranquil surroundings of New Hampshire’s dense forests and serene lakes. Raised by his single mother in a small town, roger’s early appreciation for music was shaped by the natural symphony of crickets, crackling campfires, and forest sounds. Identifying as a gay man using he/they pronouns, roger’s path into songwriting was a natural progression, translating his poignant coming-of-age experiences into intimate bedroom-pop folk songs.
Following the passing of his mother, roger relocated to Los Angeles with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to transform his grief into a powerful musical journey. Influenced by artists like Noah KahanKacey Musgraves, roger has crafted a sound that blends emotional depth with authentic storytelling. His music draws inspiration from the balladry of Lewis Capaldi, the pop vocals of Shawn Mendes, and the introspective vibe of Gracie Abrams, creating a unique sound that is entirely his own.
“MY OWN WAKE” follows roger weeks’ single “Feels Like Treason” which was released earlier this year. 
In 2021, roger’s single “Alone Is Better” went viral on TikTok, earning support from Spotify Editorial playlists such as Fresh Finds and Fresh Finds: Pop, along with features in Chill Only, Indie Mixtape, and A1234. His track “I Hate You” also received Spotify Editorial support and gained significant attention from his rapidly growing TikTok audience, which now boasts 34.1k followers. roger’s debut single “IRON” achieved notable success with a primetime placement on Showtime’s season finale of “Shameless.”
In March 2023, roger released a cover of Hilary Duff‘s “Come Clean,” which has been featured on Spotify’s Sad Covers playlist for over a year. Following this, in May 2023, he released “North Dakota,” a song about finding love in being alone and the journey to self-acceptance. This track resonated widely, going viral on TikTok and Instagram with over 5 million views. roger has consistently gone viral on Instagram Reels and has amassed a loyal and engaged following of 25k people on the platform.
roger’s goal with his music is to make others feel less alone in life. Having been through so much himself, he aims for his music to be a vessel to help others heal and feel understood. He is poised to spend 2024 sharing his catalog with the world, offering a sound that resonates with both emotional strength and raw authenticity. And keep an ear out—an album is in the works and set to drop at the top of 2025.
