 I'm not a racist, but....... 
    Report  
I can think of only one way to construct a phrase like that without being racist (hope post formatting doesn't kill it):
"I'm not a racist, but I hate socks and sandals"
"Wait... What's the relation between racism and footwear?"
"Oh, none, I just like reminding people I'm not racist. F**k racism."
"Yeah, f**k racism. And f**k socks and sandals wearers"
"Hey, I don't hate people that wear it, I just don't like it myself!"
"Oh, sorry. Nevermind"
 Everything tRump says. Not that it would be easy for my opinion of him to drop lower.

Apparently, if you don't like Trump and/or have any suggestions to make the country better, you hate America. Black and white thinking, just like children.
 "I will be home schooling; I don't want my kids going to school with dirty uneducated little Mexicans."This statement was made while speaking with a FORMER friend on the phone.Considered her my best friend for 10 years before she said that.Couldn't cut her out of my life fast enough. 1) That is a disgusting statement to make PERIOD, about anyone. I refuse to have that B.S. in my life.2) My son is half Mexican.

In my experience, the people I've met who insist on homeschooling are completely unqualified to teach their kids anything other than fairy tales and disproven myths
 My first time posting a photo in Bored Panda, the first comment was critical and dismissive!

I'm so sorry you had to go through that. There are some very sharp tongued people on here, just like any social media. But there are a lot of regulars here who are supportive and friendly. I've found it's best to stand up to the people who make you feel like c**p over something they just don't like, but not necessarily wrong. Please don't get discouraged and show your stuff to the world.
 During an evaluation meeting several years back: "You've demonstrated hard work and integrity, so for you position next year, your options are to [take a role as a thankless leader] or to [enter department full of frustration]."

You're great at your job! Let me give you a completely different one and penalize you for the learning curve
 "Everyone gets so offended these days." Well, geez mom, what are you saying around people? 
    Report  
To be fair, there is a recent and very common practice of looking for issues - hence the term micro-aggressions
 I had a math teacher I really liked and admired in high school once say the following: "Girls who dress with skimpy clothes are just asking to be raped." Haven't had any respect for that man since--and this was 35 years ago. I was floored and just disappointed when I heard that come out of his stupid mouth. 
    Report  
Unfortunately that thinking still exists.
 "It is what it is". from Felon Trump. Translates to - Its all a mess but oh well 
    Report  
 Whenever you voice out something personal and they reply with an ignorant answer like:so?and?kwhatever i didn't ask.Immediately my perspective of you is gonna drop.

My "friend" is like this. AFTER I JUST GOT AN OPPORTUNITY OUT OF 160 PEOPLE TO GO TO AN AUTHOR MEET AND GREET! She just went "I dont care. Shut up" I swear I was going to punch her then errupt into tears
 "Yes, it is true but..." This when asked for an opinion or an input and someone already made up their minds on what they will do. Then why ask? 
    Report  
This isn't guaranteed but they may just be trying to expose their thinking process to give you more info on how they got to where they are. But I get it what you're saying. Some people just want to say it out loud to someone.
 " This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you " 
    Report  
Lies. All lies.
 When a so-called 'edgy' comedian starts a bit with "Comedy has gotten hard..."They almost always follow it with jokes about race, gender roles, or sexuality that are outdated and cringe.Comedy hasn't gotten hard. You're just upset that people don't want to hear you make jokes about s******g on other people, cultures, and lifestyles. 
    Report  
The perpetually offended, make up a much more insignificant portion of society than they would like everyone to believe....which is why despite all the "controversy" surrounding many of the most successful comics, drummed up by a few thousand people on twitter...they continue to sell out every venue they book. YOU are entitled to like or dislike whatever you wish....you have no right to dictate what others say or enjoy.
 A guy at work posted something he had on Facebook. Someone contacted him and offered him tools or a laptop. I told him you know they're stolen? And he said yeah, bur you could wipe the computer. 
    Report  
I wrote that poorly. They offered to make a trade with him for stolen things. He was OK with that. Always liked him before that.
