Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” notches its 18th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The crossover hit is now only one week away from tying the longest run at No. 1 in the Hot 100 chart’s 66-year history, which is currently held by Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus), which reigned for 19 weeks back in 2019. Also of note this week, Gracie Abrams cracks the Top 10 for the first time in her career, as “That’s So True” jumps seven places to reach No. 6. Elsewhere in the Top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” sticks at No. 2, Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” remains at No. 3, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” hods at No. 4, while her “Taste” drops a spot to No. 8, Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control,” remains at No. 5, Post Malone’s “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, drops a spot to No. 7, Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” slides down a slot to No. 9, and Wallen’s “Love Somebody” falls a spot to No. 10.
