The 66th Annual Grammy Awards is taking in Los Angeles, first with a pre-telecast ceremony where a majority of the awards are dished out to deserving winners.
Metallica won Best Metal Performance for their 72 Seasons album, and bassist Robert Trujillo was on hand to accept for the band. Trujillo, in his acceptance, stated, "This is like family. When you're making an album like this you're jamming and collaborating and the spirit of 72 Seasons is the youth and creating music together. Keep those instruments in your hands and let's keep the youth making music and keeping the dream alive!"
Boygenius emerged victorious for Best Rock Performance for "Not Strong Enough." They also won Best Rock Song and Best Alternative Music Album (The Record).
Paramore, who were not in attendance, won for Best Rock Album for This Is Why. They also won for Best Alternative Music Performance.
The night's big awards are given out during the broadcast on CBS airing from 8PM ET to approximately 11:30PM ET. Paramount+ subscribers with Showtime will be able to stream the event live, with all other tiered subscriber packages affording viewers the ability to watch the day after.
