Musician Gracie Abrams just revealed a dramatic yet relatable moment involving Taylor Swift, a fire extinguisher, and a small apartment fire.
The video comes just days after Abrams disclosed to Billboard in a June 18 article that Swift once saved their lives during the incident. The video, shared on Abrams' Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, June 21 to celebrate the release of their new collaboration "Us," captured the unexpected event and a peek at their songwriting process.
In the footage, a candle is seen on a kitchen island completely engulfed in flames. Swift looked visibly confused while she held a small fire extinguisher, attempting to put out the fire. "Wait, what do I do about this?" she asked, struggling to remove the protective pin.
Abrams, 24, tried to keep the situation under control and laughed while instructing the "Bad Blood" singer what to do. "Not water! This happened... this happened to me," she warned. 34-year-old Swift, narrating her own attempt to operate the extinguisher, added a touch of drama by saying, "I think we're going to die." Abrams quickly reassured her, "No, we're not gonna die. But you never put this out with water, you know that..."
"I don't know!" a frustrated Swift exclaimed, continuing to grapple with the stubborn extinguisher. Finally, she managed to dislodge the pin and extinguish the fire with a strong stream followed by a loud shatter from the candle's container. After the flames subsided, the 14-time Grammy winner surveyed the aftermath. "Our purses are ruined. And my shoes. And the whole room, I think," she noted, while Abrams tries to lighten the mood, laughing and noting, "It smells really good though."

The video ends with one of Swift's cats – the suspected culprit – humorously peeking through the door. The video also included a clip of Abrams dealing with her own fire incident, seemingly the one she mentioned to the pop star before, where she mistakenly used water on a flaming container, causing a dangerous flare-up.
Despite the initial panic, Swifties praised the singer's eventual success in handling the situation, leaving comments like, "Taylor slayed that fire!" and, "when the song is literally fire."
