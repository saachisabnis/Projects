The 66th Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony will take place in a few weeks and fans have been speculating about the singer who will win. Here are our Grammys 2024 predictions for the winners.
Taylor Swift and SZA are the most popular choices and the two frontrunners when it comes to the artist who will take home the biggest Grammy Awards.
Here are all the nominees of 2024’s Grammys under various categories. The ones most likely to win are highlighted in bold:
Taylor Swift is very likely to take home both Song of the Year and Album of the Year as the Midnights album received great critical and commercial success. Moreover, Swift’s release of her concert film The Eras Tour Movie has only bolstered her popularity and will no doubt help her chances of winning both categories.
Billie Eilish is the most likely nominee to take home Record of the Year for What Was I Made For? as not only was it made popular by being used as part of the soundtrack of 2023’s Barbie but had also become the number-one song in many countries like the United Kingdom, and Ireland.
Ice Spice is the most likely candidate to win Best New Artist as she has been making waves across the world via her breakout music hits, which include “Barbie World” from 2023’s Barbie, SNL appearance, and chart domination.
In entertainment elsewhere, here is the new release date for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Also, here is our review of Destroy All Neighbours.
