Chappell Roan snapped at one of the red carpet photographers at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards in Long Island on Wednesday.
The 26-year-old shot to fame this year for her album The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess and has repeatedly landed in hot water for her attitude to celebrity.
She has been vocal about her exasperation over 'weird' fans making her 'uncomfortable' with their intrusive behavior - prompting a backlash from social media users who felt she was being ungrateful for her stardom.
Now, as she walks her first major awards show red carpet, Chappell proved she is undeterred by the blowback and will continue to express herself unfiltered.
When a photographer was heard shouting: 'Shut the f*** up,' Chappell turned and bellowed back: 'YOU shut the f*** up!' in footage obtained by DailyMail.com.
Chappell Roan snapped at one of the red carpet photographers at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards in Long Island on Wednesday; pictured at another moment on the same red carpet 
The exchange began when a male photographer off-camera was heard apparently shouting that someone needed to 'turn.'
Chappell at that point was facing away from the cameras, as she was in the process of having her extravagant red carpet outfit adjusted.
She put a saucy spin in a medieval warrior princess costume, complete with a plunging chiffon frock, a large cross, spiked fingernails, gauntlets and a sword.
Occasionally she garnished the look with a sumptuous green royal robe, complete with fabric epaulettes, gold brocade accents and a train.
When the photographer was heard saying: 'Shut the f*** up,' Chappell rounded on him, pointed and fired back: 'YOU shut the f*** up!' 
She added: 'No! Not me, b****!' prompting whoops from some of the observers on the scene. 'Tell him, girl,' said one woman who was watching the encounter.
The Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl singer, who has come out as a lesbian, was accompanied by a towering mystery man dressed as a medieval guard. 
Chappell is nominated for four VMAs - best new artist, best trending video for Hot To Go!, MTV Push performance of the year for Red Wine Supernova, and song of the summer for Good Luck, Babe! - and will also perform at the awards show.
Her red carpet outburst comes after she voiced her 'frustration' that people are only now beginning to take her seriously as an artist - which she revealed during a new candid interview.

The 26-year-old shot to fame this year for her album The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess and has repeatedly landed in hot water for her attitude to celebrity
Now, as she walks her first major awards show red carpet, Chappell proved she is undeterred by the blowback and will continue to express herself unfiltered
The Pink Pony Club singer - who recently got into hot water after blasting fans for wanting photos - made the comments in a cover story for the outlet which was published on Tuesday. 
'What's so infuriating is how people are just now taking me seriously,' she expressed. 'Like, "You know what, b***h? I've been doing this s*** and you're just now catching up."' 
'Part of me hopes I never have a hit again because then no one will ever expect anything from me again,' the star told Rolling Stone.
But Chappell explained that music is her passion. 'It's my dream job. I never know if it's going to be like this ever again, which is kind of scary.'
However, some fans were once again left unimpressed and jumped to X to share their thoughts, with one penning, 'All she does is complain.' 
Another typed, 'I am tired of hearing about this woman all she does is complain,' while one shared, 'Girl, can you enjoy for a sec? You complaining about everything is kinda annoying.' 
A social media user wrote, 'Girl are you appreciating your fame or what,' while one added, 'Fame takes time to come baby, calm down.' 
'All she does is complain oh my god,' a fan penned, and another shared, 'Can she stop setting herself up.' 
Her red carpet outburst comes after she voiced her 'frustration' that people are only now beginning to take her seriously as an artist 
Others wrote, 'One thing about her is she's gonna complain about her job,' as well as, 'She should be thankful to her fans instead that she is getting the fame and getting recognized.' 
However, some fans came to Chappell's defense on X, with one adding, 'Chappell Roan's frustration is totally understandable. It's tough when your hard work isn't recognized until later.' 
'Well, that's the music industry for you-people love to jump on the bandwagon once you're already blowing up,' another penned. 
'Chappell Roan has been grinding for years, and now everyone wants to act like they "discovered" her. Classic.' 
The star also opened up about dealing with her rapid success following the release of her album The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess - which notably landed the number two spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. 
'I was getting almost a hundred thousand followers a day. At first, I was in severe denial,' Roan admitted. 
'They would literally show me some stats and the only thing I could do is say, "No, no, no. It's not like that." I couldn't say, "I am gaining success."' 
During her interview with Rolling Stone, she talked about fans and expressed, ' I don't want to be agoraphobic. That's [how] most of my peers [feel]. Every f***ing artist is on this page.'

'Everyone is uncomfortable with fans. Some people just have more patience. I f***ing don't.' 
Last month in August, the songstress shared a rant on TikTok as she slammed 'weird' fans. 
'I need you to answer questions - just answer my questions for a second. If you saw a random woman on the street, would you yell at her from your car window?' she expressed. 
'Would you harass her in public? Would you go up to a random lady and say, "Can I take a photo with you?" and she says, "No, what the f***?" And then you get mad at this random lady?' 
She continued, 'Would you be offended if she says no to your time - because she has her own time?' the Good Luck, Babe! artist said. 'Would you stalk her family? Would you follow her around? Would you try to dissect her life and bully her online?'
'This is a lady you don't know and she doesn't know you at all. Would you assume that she's a good person, assume she's a bad person? Would you assume everything you read online about her is true?'
'I'm a random b****, you're a random b****. Just think about that for a second, okay?' the performer added in the clip. 
Chappell then explained that she refused to accept 'stalking' and 'harassment' as 'normal' behavior from fans. 
The Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl singer, who has come out as a lesbian, was accompanied by a towering mystery man dressed as a medieval guard
'I don't care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous, whatever.'
She added, 'I don't care that it's normal. I don't care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, the career field I've chosen.'
'That does not make it okay that doesn't make it normal. That doesn't mean that I want it, that doesn't mean that I like it...' 
Roan added that she didn't 'give a f***' if people thought she was 'selfish' if she said 'no for a photo or for your time or for a hug. That's not normal, that's weird.'
And while talking to Interview Magazine last month, she also admitted that she didn't care about being a success in the music industry. 
At one point she said, 'Like, my career doesn't mean anything more now that I have a charting album and song. If anything, I'm just like, "F*** you guys for not seeing what actually matters."
'A chart is so fleeting. Everyone leaves the charts. I'm just like, "This is giving valedictorian."'
Chappell added, 'But everyone graduates. The valedictorian doesn't really matter, and that's kind of what I feel like right now. I'm like, "Cool. Maybe I'm valedictorian, but it's weird that we're graduating, and everyone's going to move, so…"'
She is up for four VMAs including best new artist, best trending video for Hot To Go!, MTV Push performance of the year for Red Wine Supernova
Elsewhere in the Rolling Stone interview, the singer got candid about her mental health and how therapy has helped her. 
'I realized I can't live like this. I can't live being so depressed or feel so lost that I want to kill myself.' 
'I just got my s*** together…I would not have been able to handle any of this even a year ago today. It would've just been too much.'
Earlier this year, Roan came out publicly that she is gay and told the outlet, 'You don't necessarily have to be out-loud out. You can kind of silently celebrate if you would like.' 
'It's like, look, I love being gay. I just don't want to talk about it every second of every day.'
Chappell also briefly discussed a new love interest who is 'completely outside the industry.'
'She's so awesome and so secure in herself and [has told me], "No pressure, we can just be friends if you want."' 
Roan said, 'I'm just running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I'm just like, "What? I can't get married!" It is that type of delusion right now.'
