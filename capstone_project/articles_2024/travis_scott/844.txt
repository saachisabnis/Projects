Camila Cabello went incognito for Paris Fashion Week this year.
The “I Luv It” singer, 27, was seen arriving at Vetements’ runway show on Friday wearing a balaclava ski mask over her face. The covering only showed her eyes and lips.
She also sported a pair of diamond drop earrings as she let her black hair flow underneath the mask. 
Cabello completed the look with a black mini skirt over a lacy black bodysuit. She also added a pair of strappy heels, a floor-length coat and black lace gloves.
Other celebrities present at the fashion show included Travis Scott, Gigi Hadid, Ice Spice, J Balvin, Bella Thorne and Tom Daley. 
Cabello was also joined by her former fellow Fifth Harmony member Normani at the show, where they posed for a cute photo together. 
Cabello’s return to her dark hair roots comes months after she debuted her blonde locks in February — a move that had fans shocked with her “Xtina moment.” 
“🔥I FEEL like we are gonna get a STRIPPED xtina type ERA😮🤩,” one fan theorized.
“Camila wanted a big moment for 2024 and what bigger moment than her going platinum blonde! A color she has never been before!,” her hairstylist Nikki Lee said of the transformation at the time.
“Our promise to each other was we could do it, but only if we kept her hair as healthy as possible,” she added.
” We got her to this color with 3 appointments. When going from almost black hair to platinum blonde hair it’s important to be patient and understand that it’s a process.”
In June, Cabello revealed the switch was inspired by other artists, sharing during a Cannes Lions dinner, “Whatever I do, I learned how exciting that is from people like Madonna or David Bowie.”
