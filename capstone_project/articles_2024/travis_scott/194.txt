History has been made. For the first time ever, Rolling Loud in Miami has decided to feature a Christian hip hop set for their 2024 festival. For those not familiar with Rolling Loud, they bring in artists like Travis Scott, Future, and Playboi Carti on a regular basis. They invited Hulvey, nobigdyl., Jon Keith, Caleb Gordon, and more to perform over the weekend. The 40-minute set ended with Hulvey sharing his testimony and professing the name of Jesus.
