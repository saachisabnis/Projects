Pop superstar Taylor Swift was spotted at Arrowhead Stadium to support her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce for his team's 'Black Friday' game against the AFC West Division rival Las Vegas Raiders.
Swift, 34, was seen entering the stadium with Kelce's mother, Donna, and her own father, Scott, on Friday (November 29). The pop star had recently missed the Chiefs' last two road games as she finishes the final stops on her historic 'Eras Tour' concert, which is set to conclude next weekend in Vancouver.
Swift was in attendance during the Chiefs' November 10 home game against the Denver Broncos, which saw Kelce record his 76th career touchdown reception, tying Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez for the most among Chiefs players. Kelce enters Friday's game with 68 receptions for 569 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games.
Kelce famously revealed that he attempted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number when he attended her concert at Arrowhead Stadium prior to their relationship in 2023. Swift later said that the three-time Super Bowl champion "very adorably put me on blast" when he acknowledged the situation on his New Heights podcast, which she said "was metal as hell" while being featured as Time Magazine's 'Person of the Year' in December 2023.
