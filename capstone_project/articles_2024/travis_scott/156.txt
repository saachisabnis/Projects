(Reuters) –     Hip hop star Travis Scott was arrested on disorderly intoxication and trespassing charges on Thursday in Miami Beach, Florida, NBC News reported, citing jail records.
Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, 33, was jailed at about 4:30 a.m., the news network reported.
Scott was taken into custody at about 1:15 a.m. local time after police responded to a call regarding a fight on a yacht, according to NBC News.
Officers said when they arrived they found Scott on a dock, yelling at the passengers on the yacht, according to NBC News, citing an affidavit.
Officers could sense “a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant’s breath,” NBC reported, citing the affidavit.
Scott agreed with officers to leave the dock, but returned minutes later to the scene where he was arrested, officers said in the affidavit.
Miami Beach police were not immediately available for comment.
