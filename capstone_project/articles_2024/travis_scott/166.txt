DJ Khaled recently upgraded his wrist game with a new Audemars Piguet watch and he’s quite enamored with his purchase.
Taking to his Instagram Story to show off the new piece on Wednesday (February 14), Khaled found new meaning for its AP initials as he admired the gold, diamond-encrusted watch.

“I call her AP – absolutely pretty,” he said. “Look how beautiful this is.”
You can view the watch – which runs in the six-figure range – below:
DJ Khaled has been working hard as of late, and the new Audemars is definitely the fruits of his labor. Earlier this month, the We The Best boss dropped two different capsule collections with major brands – one with Tommy Hilfiger and the other with Gatorade.
The golf-themed Tommy x We The Best collection features nine different polo shirts inspired by Hilfiger’s 1990s styles, which became iconic in Hip Hop when they were adopted by artists like Grand Puba, Snoop Dogg and Aaliyah.

Appropriately, Puba’s verse on Mary J. Blige’s 1992 classic “What’s the 411?” which shouts out Hilfiger and brags about “[D]oin’ lovely in all sports/ Even swing the pole at the hole on my golf course,” soundtracks an ad for the collection.
DJ Khaled said on Instagram that all profits from the collection would go to his We The Best Foundation, which provides scholarships, music programs, and more for children in the Miami area.

“I’ve loved Gatorade since I was a kid and to this day, I have it in the studio with me to fuel my creativity,” DJ Khaled said in a statement. “I’m so blessed they gave me the keys to create this legendary capsule. Gatorade, We The Best and Jordan Brand…we all icons and this is just proof!”
On the music side, Khaled recently teased a new song on the way with Travis Scott, which will live on a forthcoming album from the Miami-based hitmaker.
