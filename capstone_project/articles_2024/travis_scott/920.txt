Travis Scott will be getting off scot-free following his arrest in Paris earlier this week.
On Saturday (August 10), Paris prosecutors told TMZ that no charges would be filed against the star, and that he had been released from jail.

Scott was arrested on Friday (August 9) after he allegedly attacked a security guard at the swanky George V Hotel. According to reports, the guard was trying to break up an existing scuffle between the Astroworld rapper and his bodyguard.
Prosecutors in Paris said in a statement to NBC News: “I can confirm that on August 9, 2024, police officers were called to the George V hotel and arrested the rapper nicknamed Travis Scott for assaulting a security guard.”

“The security guard had intervened to separate the rapper from his bodyguard. The Paris public prosecutor’s office has referred the case to the 1st district of the judicial police,” the statement added.
The arrest comes just two months after La Flame was booked in Miami for disorderly intoxication and trespassing.

The disorderly intoxication charge has since been dropped, but prosecutors are pushing forward with the trespassing charge which carries a sentence of up to 60 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $500.
If a person is present in the structure where the trespass occurs, it’s considered a first-degree misdemeanor which can carry up to one year in jail.

As previously reported, Travis Scott was arrested in the early hours of June 20 for causing a “disturbance” on a charter boat at the Miami Beach Marina.
“He was drunk, causing a disturbance, and asked to leave multiple times,” police officers said.

In newly-leaked bodycam footage, Scott can be seen telling officers that they “scared” him and criticizing the police for being heavy-handed in their approach.
The footage showed Scott arguing with cops over him allegedly trespassing on a yacht to retrieve his belongings, with him subsequently being restrained and handcuffed by four officers before being led into a police car.

Scott will face trial for the trespassing charge on September 10.
