Mississippi State University Extension sincerely appreciates the time and effort of the cooperating growers and Mississippi State University agronomists. In addition, several independent consultants (Ty Edwards, Jason Grafton, Bert Falkner, Tucker Miller, and Tim Richards) provided tremendous assistance with these trials. Sincere gratitude is also extended to the following seed companies and representatives for providing seed for these trials: BASF, Andy White and Bill Long; Crop Production Services/Dyna-Gro, Scott Cummings; Phytogen Cottonseed, Jonathan Siebert; Americot/NexGen, Chase Samples and Terry Campbell; and Delta and Pine Land, Greg Ferguson. Cooperation from all parties was essential for the success of the 2022 MSU Extension On-Farm Cotton Variety Demonstration Program. In addition, partial financial support for this project was provided by each participating company and Cotton Incorporated.
The cotton variety selection process is often difficult and, in many cases, leaves growers wondering for the remainder of the growing season whether they made the right variety selections. Furthermore, the rapid introduction of new varieties and discontinued production of older ones has become commonplace over the past several years.
Historically, a premier variety would remain in the marketplace for a long period of time. However, a variety that performs well today typically has a life span of 4 to 6 years. One that does not perform well will likely remain on the market for less than 3 years. In addition, the historical standard for variety testing information was to have 2 to 3 years of data prior to release of any given variety. Today, 1 to 2 years of “broad scale” variety testing is common prior to release of a new variety. Therefore, greater demand has been placed upon testing a variety in as many environments as possible as a substitute for multiple years of data. In most cases, variety testing prior to release is conducted by private industry through a series of testing methods and through University Official Variety Trial (OVT) programs. OVT data is typically available for 1 year prior to release of a given variety.
Our on-farm testing program is not designed to replace or compete with small-plot OVT testing programs; rather, it is designed to complement the data that is provided by OVT programs. The use of large-plot variety trial data in conjunction with small-plot OVT data provides a tremendous resource with respect to variety performance to the growers of Mississippi.
The on-farm testing program at MSU is designed to test varieties in as many environments as possible. Limiting the number of entries allows for efficient planting and harvest operations and requires a minimum amount of time from cooperating growers. The number of variety entries each participating company is given depends on market share. In addition, one or two at-large entries are given to smaller companies to provide equal opportunity to as many seed providers as possible. Our on-farm variety tests are usually planted in eight- or twelve-row sets using planting equipment provided by each respective grower. In some cases, four- or six-row sets are used, depending on site characteristics and grower preference. In addition, two replications of each variety are planted and harvested at all locations. Plot lengths ranged from 500 to 2,600 feet in 2022, depending on the characteristics of the field the trial was conducted in. Seed treatments are at the discretion of the company providing seed. A premium seed treatment package, including an insecticide, fungicide, and nematicide, was provided for each variety. In-season management is at the discretion of the grower, and each is encouraged to manage the plot area as they would manage any given field on their farm.
Each replication for each variety was individually harvested using standard harvest equipment. Harvest weights were collected using a boll buggy or trailer modified to display the weight of seed cotton it contains. Before all harvest operations, each boll buggy or trailer was calibrated by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce to ensure that accurate harvest weights were collected. An 8- to 10-pound seed cotton sample was collected for each variety tested. To reduce ginning time, subsamples from replications number one and two were composited into a single sample. Seed cotton was ginned at the University of Tennessee, West Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center (WTREC). Ginning equipment at the WTREC consists of a 20-saw Continental Eagle gin equipped with a stick machine, incline cleaners, two lint cleaners, and a condenser. Fiber quality for each ginned sample was determined using a high-volume instrument (HVI) located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Classing Office in Memphis.
A maximum of 10 core variety entries per year are allowed in the MSU Extension On-Farm Cotton Variety Demonstration Program. Entries are allotted by market share from respective companies. One entry per year is automatically given to the variety planted on the highest acreage in the previous year based on the annual Varieties Planted Report from USDA-Agricultural Marketing Service. In 2022, Delta and Pine Land was allotted three spots; Phytogen Cottonseed, Americot, and BASF/Stoneville were allotted two spots; and one additional at-large entry was given to Dyna-Gro to provide parity between smaller companies with fewer resources than larger companies have. Entries in the 2022 MSU Extension On-Farm Cotton Variety Demonstration Program are listed in Table 2.
Six locations were in the Delta and six were in the Hills. All Delta locations were irrigated, and five of the six Hill locations were dryland. The remaining Hill location (Crawford) was pivot irrigated. Field sites were chosen based upon grower preference and required elements to conduct a reliable yield trial.
Each data table includes the following: variety, lint yield, lint percent, micronaire (Mic), staple length (in inches), fiber strength, fiber uniformity, and leaf grade. Data analysis using SAS v. 9.4 was conducted on all replicated trials. Grand means (averages) are presented as well as least significant differences (LSD). LSDs are the smallest value with which we can confidently say there is a difference between two means. Differences in means less than the given LSD value are likely due to variability within a given field or environment. For non-replicated trials and fiber data at individual locations, LSDs are not applicable. For locations that were replicated and data from one replication of a given variety was lost, SAS will interpret these data as missing and provide data analysis based on estimates. Therefore, average data for a given location may be slightly different than data reported.
