Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce as his Kansas City Chiefs took on the Houston Texans.
The pop star, 35, was spotted at the Saturday, December 21, home game, the final game taking place at the Chiefs’ Kansas City, Missouri, stadium during the 2024-2025 NFL regular season. Swift rocked a red jacket with fur trim with knee-high black boots coordinated with a black bucket hat. Swift’s mom, Andrea, and dad, Scott, accompanied her.
Kelce, 35, and his teammates will finish out the regular season with away games against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday, December 25, and the Denver Broncos at a yet-to-be-determined date. The Chiefs’ season won’t end there, though, as they have already clinched a spot in the playoffs.
While Kelce is gearing up for his busiest time of the year, Swift wrapped her nearly two-year Eras Tour run in Vancouver on December 8. Between March 2023 and December 2024, the venture grossed a record-breaking $2 billion and was attended by 10.1 million fans across 149 dates.

To celebrate the accomplishment, Kelce organized an Eras-themed surprise soirée for Swift earlier this month.
“When she thought she was going to a small, quiet dinner but it was actually a giant surprise party with her friends and family, props included 🥳,” Swift’s pal Ashley Avignone captioned a Thursday, December 19, Instagram post with photos from the gathering.
In a series of images shared by attendees, Swift posed with her inner circle — including Avignone, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes, the Haim sisters, Jerrod Carmichael and Lyndsay Bell — as guests wore Eras-inspired outfits. She also danced with Kelce and smiled as he placed a black hat on her head in a nod to the “22” portion of her concert. Kelce, meanwhile, was dressed in a black tuxedo and top hat, referencing his on-stage cameo during one of Swift’s London shows in June.
JoJo Edwards-Helaire, the wife of Kelce’s teammate Clyde Edwards-Helaire, also confirmed in a TikTok comment that the “congratulations party” was “a surprise from Trav.”

Ahead of the tour’s conclusion, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Swift and Kelce “want to do ‘normal things’ as a couple” now that her schedule is not as packed.
As for whether an engagement is on the horizon for the couple, a second insider noted that they are not rushing it.
“Taylor does feel like Travis is The One, but jumping in is not her style,” the second insider revealed. “That’s just not how she does [things]. Marriage is a big deal, and she wants [it to be] forever.”
