Future appears to take a particularly menacing shot at Gunna on Ferg‘s new single “Allure.”
The song, which arrived on Friday (October 4), features the duo trading bars over a Mike WiLL Made-It beat built around haunting synths and trap drums.

During his guest verse, Hendrix warns an unnamed enemy: “You took a plea on my slime, won’t be surprised you ended up dead.”
Fans were quick to connect the lyrics to Gunna, who controversially accepted an Alford plea in his and Young Thug‘s YSL RICO case, for which the YSL rapper (whose nickname is, of course, Slime) is still on trial.

“Future Dissing Gunna on his new Feature?” one listener wrote on X (formerly Twitter), while another joked: “Future old ass not letting up on Gunna.”
A third user chimed in: “Future still on Gunna neck cuz yall keep tryna overlook it so he keep reminding yall what happened.”
The apparent shot is just the latest from Future, who began jabbing Gunna earlier this year when he deleted a social media post promoting the rapper’s “Prada Dem” single with Offset.
Shortly after, the Freebandz boss shared a snippet of “Type Shit,” his collaboration with Travis Scott and Playboi Carti that wound up on his and Metro Boomin‘s We Don’t Trust You album, where he raps: “I don’t hang with rats, that’s some new type shit / Get a n-gga whacked on the news type shit.”

Pluto later seemingly attempted to overshadow Gunna’s One of Wun album by implying that he would be dropping a new mixtape on May 10, the same that day that One of Wun was scheduled to arrive.
“Fuck yo album Shit ain’t slappin like my MIXTAPE,” he tweeted, before adding: “MAY TENTH [sneezing face emoji].”

Gunna still caught a stray when Mixtape Pluto eventually arrived last month, though, as he was removed from the song “Told My,” which previously leaked with a verse from the YSL star.
Reacting to being cut from the mixtape, Gunna seemingly took it in stride by writing on social media: “Its not Personal it’s just business.”
