Reading & Leeds Festival announced the first round of artists set to appear at their 2025 joint events. The headliners for these celebrated English music festivals will be Travis Scott, Chappell Roan, Hozier, and Bring Me the Horizon. Those artists will top the bill at the dual-festivals held in Reading, Berkshire, and Leeds, Yorkshire, on August 21-24. The festivals will take place at Little John’s Farm in Reading and Bramham Park in Leeds, with the same lineups performing at both locations throughout the course of the weekend. Scott’s appearance is being touted as a European festival exclusive, while Hozier and Bring Me the Horizon will be U.K. exclusive performances. Roan’s high-profile set will be an English headlining exclusive, as well as her first ever performance at Reading & Leeds. Bloc Party will also be performing the inaugural Icon Set at Reading & Leeds, which the festival said in a press release “will celebrate the defining acts synonymous with the festival.” (Billboard)
