WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wisconsin [Jan. 29, 2024] – The Wisconsin Outstanding Young Farmer (OYF) program is pleased to announce Jacob and Jennifer Hoewisch, Fremont, Wisconsin, were selected as the 2024 Wisconsin Outstanding Young Farmers during the 70th Annual Awards Weekend Jan. 26- 27.
As long as Jacob Hoewisch can remember, he has wanted to be a farmer. When he was in fourth grade his dad and uncle combined their dairy herds and built a freestall barn and milking parlor creating Hoewisch Homestead Dairy LLC at Fremont.
The same year his parents decided it was best to homeschool Jacob which allowed him to be around to learn and observe what was happening on the farm while also concentrating on his studies. That opened the door for Jacob to begin working toward his goal of joining the family business and eventually taking over. The family has a succession plan in place and Jacob’s official job is a salaried manager of the business.
Since taking over the management of the farm he has added cover crops and transitioned to no till. As a result, everything on the farm is now green all year.
On the dairy side of things, he experimented with breeding the cows with A1 genetics to beef. In 2018 he started genomically testing the herd using tissue samples and using that information to decide which animals to breed to beef. This led not only for the milking herd to be A2/A2 status, but also started the opportunity to direct market beef.
Jacob and Jennifer are active in the Waupaca County Farm Bureau. They are also WFBF state committee members and Jacob served as County YFA chair from 2011 to 2021. Both are also youth group leaders at their church. He is also a part of the Township of Caledonia farmer-led water shed group and he serves on the Fox Valley Technical College Advisory committee.
The Hoewisch’s are sponsored by United Veterinary Services, GreenStone FCS, Swiderski Equipment, Service Motor Company, Becks Seeds, and Farm First Co-op.

The Reu’s farm is near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where they have a 5000+ acre grain and beef operation. Matt and Heather were sponsored by Insight FS, Sauk Valley Bank and Alcivia.
