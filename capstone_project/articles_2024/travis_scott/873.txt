Kylie Jenner finds it "hard to keep up with the internet".
Kylie Jenner has opened up about her relationship with social media
The 27-year-old make-up mogul has a huge following on various social media platforms, including 396 million followers on Instagram - but Kylie actually enjoys being offline these days.
The brunette beauty - who has Stormi, six, and Aire, two, with her ex-partner Travis Scott - told the November 2024 issue of ELLE magazine: "My friends and I laugh because it’s hard to keep up with the internet now. It’s exhausting. 
"When I was posting 24/7 - waking up, what I’m eating for breakfast, what I’m wearing for the day, the colour of my nails, what car I’m driving, where I’m driving to - I didn’t have an intense schedule. I wasn’t working as much; I didn’t have kids and just had more time. 
"If you’re not posting three times a day on TikTok, you fall behind."

Kylie is also keen to protect her children from the dark sides of social media.

Kylie - who is rumoured to be dating actor Timothee Chalamet - shared: "When I do share my children, I want it to come from me or their father."

Despite this, Kylie doesn't have too many regrets about the decisions she's taken in her life and in her career.

The reality star is also determined to focus on the future, rather than dwelling on her past.

Kylie - who has enjoyed huge success with her Kylie Cosmetics brand - explained: "I have to give my younger self grace. I don’t like to have too many regrets in life. I think my path is what got me here today. 

"I’m happy with where I am and just have to keep moving forward."
