Future and Metro Boomin are on tour promoting their latest albums, We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You, both of which have been praised as some of the year's top releases. However, there is some debate surrounding the tour's success. Amid the ongoing tensions with Drake, fans have been sharing screenshots of arenas that appear to have many empty seats. Despite this, evidence shows the tour is thriving. A prime example occurred last night in Brooklyn, where the arena was packed to capacity, a positive sign for both artists. They also surprised the audience by bringing out Travis Scott, igniting the crowd's excitement. This collaboration makes sense, as the trio has worked together on several hits. It will be intriguing to see what new music they create together in the future. Fans can expect more from them soon, but patience is necessary in the meantime.
