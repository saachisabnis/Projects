Future has provided an update on his next project after he stirred up plenty of excitement for it.  Fans have been eagerly waiting on a new mixtape from Pluto since he randomly announced it three weeks ago. At the time, Future hyped up the release of his project and his recent single with Tee Grizzley "Swear To God," which were supposed to drop on the same day. The Detroit rapper released his single as planned. However, Pluto held on to his project and didn't say word about it ‚Äî until this week. "I can‚Äôt sleep until it‚Äôs complete #MIXTAPEPLUTO," Future wrote on Tuesday, May 28. 
The Georgia native got fans' hopes up about the fresh body of work a few weeks after he dropped his second joint album with Metro Boomin. In a series of posts he made on X, Future announced the project, seemingly called Mixtape Pluto, would arrive on the same day as Gunna's album One of Wun. The posts prompted a response from Wunna, which fueled theories about a beef between the "Pushin P" rappers. 
"F**k yo album S**t ain‚Äôt slappin like my MIXTAPE," Pluto said. "Turn this s**t bac up Notch‚Ä¶‚Ä¶!" Gunna wrote in his own post. "F*c What These boys talkin bout üó£Ô∏è"Neither of them tagged each other in their respective posts, but that didn't stop fans from discussing the possibility of another major rap war. Future and Gunna have worked together in the past. Things seemed to be all good between the two until earlier this year when Pluto appeared to take down his post about Gunna's single with Offset "Prada Dem." Fans noticed the move a day later when Future released a snippet of "Type S**t" with Travis Scott, which contained lines fans believed were aimed at Gunna. "I don't hang with rats, that's some new type s**t/Get a n***a whacked on new type s**t," Future raps. As of press time, Future still has not confirmed a release date for his new mixtape.
