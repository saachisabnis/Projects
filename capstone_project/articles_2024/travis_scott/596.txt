Travis Scott decided to step away from the mic and onto the runway. On Friday (Sept.28), Vetemens gave fashion lovers a sneak peek of their latest collection, with the help of the Houston native. The upcoming capsule will drop in spring 2025. Donned in an all-black, leather top and bottoms, the rapper did his best strut in front of the crowd. This wouldn’t be the first time the rapper has worked with a luxury brand. 
In 2019, Scott was tapped as the ambassador for Saint Laurent. The Rodeo rapper also modeled for the fashion house’s spring and summer collection. He’s also worked with brands like Helmut Lang, and Ksubi, and even partnered with the late Virgil Abloh for a limited-edition capsule in 2017. His most successful collaboration has been with Nike, so much so, that shoe stores felt “overwhelmed” whenever a new collection would drop.

In other news, Travis Scott got to live every 12-year-old’s dream after Ray Mysterio announced he would be his tag-team partner in August. Travis Scott is scheduled to get in the ring alongside wrestling superstar Rey Mysterio on WWE. While visiting the Fanatics Fest, Scott discussed his new project, Days Before Rodeo. But the highlight of the night was when Rey Mysterio stepped on stage and revealed that the “Sicko Mode” rapper would be joining him in the ring. 
“Are you guys ready for me to introduce my latest tag team partner?” Mysterio asked the crowd. He continued: “Are you ready? Alright. This man has shaped the landscape for hip-hop. He is an icon, [and] he is also on ‘SICKO MODE.’ He is a rapper, producer, songwriter, and Grammy-nominated. Let’s give it up for the highest in the room, my newest tag team partner, Travis Scott!”
