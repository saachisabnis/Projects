Sabrina Carpenter has scored her first ever No. 1 album of her career, as her new studio album, Short n’ Sweet, debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart this week. Short n’ Sweet recorded the third largest debut of the year, with two other big debuts featured in this week’s Top 10: the first official release of Travis Scott’s 2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo premieres at No. 2, while country superstar Lainey Wilson notches the first top 10-charting album of her career as Whirlwind debuts at No. 8 in its first week of release. Elsewhere in the Billboard 200 Top 5, Post Malone’s F-1 Trillion falls from No. 1 to No. 3, Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess drops two spots to No. 4, and Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moves down a spot to No. 5. Taylor Swift’s former No. 1 album, The Tortured Poets Department, drops out of the Top 5 for the first time since its April release, moving down three slots to No. 6. (Billboard)
