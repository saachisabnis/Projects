An original colorway from the Air Jordan 1 High’s “Metallic” series from 1986 is about to come to its low-top counterpart for the first time. 
The Air Jordan 1 Low “Metallic Black” is set to release in early October with with simple and versatile color blocking. White leather forms the majority of the upper, interrupted only by a black leather Swoosh and mustache  with a slight metallic sheen. A white wings logo sits on the heel, while Nike Air branding on the tongue appears in black. Sitting beneath the white midsole is a grey outsole. 

 









1986’s “Metallic” series consisted of seven different Air Jordan 1 High colorways and one Air Jordan 1 Low, all of which were predominantly white with their namesake color forming the Swoosh and collar. The lone low-top came in “Metallic Blue,” which made its return in the spring. “Metallic Black” now marks the first time one of the OG high-top colorways has came over to the low-top.
