The unofficial election results for the 2024 Primary Election began posting after the polls closed at 7 p.m. on Tuesday.
Morgan County Clerk and Recorder Kevin Strauch said the voting turnout was low for the Primary Election.  It was an average turnout, with 32.10% of voters turning in their ballots. There are currently 17,629 active voters, and 5,659 voters cast their ballots.
Strauch said that, all things considered, the election ran smoothly. There were approximately 40 total in-person voters in Morgan County, and the remainder were mail-in or drop-off voters.  While there are still ballots that have signature verifications, ballots turned in at other counties and ballots to be counted for military and overseas voters, they have until next Wednesday to be counted. Strauch said that there are 50 – 60 outstanding votes remaining.  The Election Canvas Board will verify the final results, and the official results will be reported next Friday.
