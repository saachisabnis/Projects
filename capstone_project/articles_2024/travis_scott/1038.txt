Emily Weir put on a very cheeky display in a daring ensemble as she stormed the red carpet at the 2024 TV Week Logie Awards on Sunday night.
The Australian actress showed off her incredible figure as she pulled out all the stops for the much-awaited awards ceremony at The Star Sydney.
She left little to the imagination as she stepped out in a dazzling pink sequinned gown with a sheer skirt that gave a flash of her peachy behind.
Emily let her head-turning ensemble do all the talking as she kept her accessories minimal and simply styled her brunette tresses in loose waves.
She added to her stunning features with a bronzed make-up palette as she worked the angles on the star-studded red carpet.
She joined a string of her Home and Away co-stars at the star-studded awards ceremony, which recognises the best talents in Australian television.
Emily, who is best known for playing Mackenzie Booth on the soap opera, appeared alongside the likes of Ada Nicodemou and James Stewart, among others.
Ada and James 'hard-launched' their relationship at the glitzy event as they finally stepped out as a couple, months after news of their romance first emerged.

The lovebirds were first romantically linked earlier this year when they were seen sharing a kiss on Anzac Day and looked as loved-up as ever on the red carpet.
For the night, Ada looked effortlessly glamorous in a one-shouldered black gown, which she styled with a gold Charlotte Olympia clutch bag.
Ada, who also plays James' love interest on the smash hit soap opera, accessorised her elegant ensemble with a chunky gold bracelet and earrings.
While James, 48, looked very handsome in his classic black and white tuxedo as he kept close to his love's side, posing with his arms wrapped around Ada.
The Home and Away cast showed their support for newcomer Tristan Gorey, who has been nominated for best new talent at the 64th Logie Awards. 
It is the only category in which the Seven soap opera has been nominated at the 2024 event, after being recognised in six different categories last year.
Also among the star-studded guest list were the Gold Logie nominees Larry Emdur, Robert Irwin, Julia Morris, Andy Lee, Asher Keddie, Sonia Kruger and Tony Armstrong.

The group are battling it out to take home the much-sought after award for most popular personality on Australian television. 
However, a notable list of celebrities also skipped the event, despite it being Australian television's long-awaited night of the year. 
Today show reporter Karl Stefanovic won't be attending as he celebrates his 50th birthday out of Sydney, according to The Daily Telegraph.
Channel Seven star David Koch, whose contract with the network is believed to be coming to an end, and Mark Ferguson, who is believed to be stepping away from the news desk, also skipped the event.
Lisa Wilkinson won't be making an appearance following her controversial 2022 Logies speech where she mentioned alleged rape victim Brittany Higgins.
Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Australian Idol's Ricki Lee-Coulter and Sylvia Jeffreys will also be skipping the Logie Awards ceremony.
