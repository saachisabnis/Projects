Live from Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, Trevor Noah returns to host the 2024 Grammy Awards!
If you’re looking to end your weekend with a medley of must-see performances, the Grammys are must-stream TV. An eclectic group of artists are set to take the stage as fans will be treated to performances by Billie Eilish, Billy Joel, Burna Boy, Dua Lipa, Joni Mitchell, Luke Combs, Olivia Rodrigo, Travis Scott, SZA, U2, and the Wonders.
The Grammys will go on with or without you, U2. Also, I’m being the told the Wonders will not be performing because they’re a fictional band from the cult 1996 film That Thing You Do!. To be fair, their addictive single was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
This year’s Record of the Year catagory is, in a word, stacked as Jon Batiste, Boygenius, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, Victoria Monét, Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, and SZA compete for the prestigious honor. A full list of nominees can be found on the official Grammys website. From start time to streaming info, here’s how to watch the 2024 Grammy Awards live online.
The Grammys air tonight (February 4) from 8:00-11:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+ with Showtime. E! Countdown to the Red Carpet airs from 4:00-8:00 p.m. on the network.
You can watch live coverage of the show as well as red carpet arrivals (beginning at 3:30 p.m. ET) via the Grammys website.
If you have a valid cable login, you can watch the 2024 Grammy Awards live on CBS, CBS.com, or the CBS app. You can also stream this hotly anticipated event via Paramount+ with Showtime and ($11.99/month), which offers a free trial for new subscribers.
You can access a CBS live stream with an active subscription to Sling TV, fuboTV, Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Stream, or YouTube TV. FuboTV and YouTube TV offer free trials for new subscribers.
The show will also be available for next-day streaming for Paramount+ Essential subscribers.
The Grammys won’t be available for next-day streaming with a traditional Hulu account, but you can watch the show live or on-demand via Hulu + Live TV.
