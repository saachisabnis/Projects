21 Savage earned his fourth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, as American Dream debuts in the top spot. The achievement was powered mostly by streaming, and marked the biggest week of the rapper’s solo career. The 15-song album dropped January 12th, featuring Metro Boomin, Doja Cat, Lil Durk, Travis Scott, Young Thug and Summer Walker. At No. 2 this week was Kali Uchis’s Orquideas, which marks her highest-charting album. Morgan Wallen’s One Thing At A Time, was No. 3, Drake’s For All the Dogs was No. 4 and Taylor Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) landed at No. 5.
