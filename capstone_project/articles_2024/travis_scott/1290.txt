Writing this introductory blurb on my phone at the midway break-point of the first sunny bike ride of the year through southeast London, and I’m one failed constitution saving throw away from just continuing to cycle out of my life and never looking back. But then how would I afford to pay for the second hand copy of Fury: Peacemaker that I also just ordered on my mobile device, the physical quality of which looked dubious from the pictures? Ah, such is life, and so on with this week’s links, below.

This week’s news.
• Starting the week with some slow trudge into the dark satanic future news, as tech startup Orange announced that it had raised ¥2.92 billion ($19 million) from investors, including manga publisher Shogakukan, to pursue the use of artificial intelligence to speed up the manga translation process by removing human translators from the equation, overcoming an apparent shortage of skilled workers in the sector, which would also mean no longer having to pay said humans – no word yet if this will include the inevitable errors in translation that TO Books’ similar scheme to use AI in this role will apparently have - critics of the plan point out that one alternative way to overcome a shortage of human translators would be to use such funding to instead have these jobs confer a living wage, and thereby make manga translation more attractive, and feasible, as a full-time career path.
• Comics awards news: The Beat and The Center for Cartoon Studies this week announced the winners of 2024’s Cartoonist Studio Prize, naming Léa Murawiec’s The Great Beyond as Best Long-Form Comic, and Cole Degenstein’s 10-10 to the Wind as best Short-Form Comic, with both cartoonists winning $1,000.
• Elsewhere, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced the winners of this year’s Pulitzer Prizes, with The New Yorker’s Medar de la Cruz winning 2024’s Prize for Illustrated Reporting and Commentary, while The New Yorker’s Angie Wang, The Washington Post’s Claire Healy, Nicole Dungca, and Ren Galeno, and the Chattanooga Times Free Press’ Clay Bennett were all named as Finalists.
• This week’s final awards story: The Society of Illustrators announced the 2024 class of inductees to their Hall of Fame, which this year includes Steve Brodner, Gustave Doré, Robert Grossman, and Yuko Shimizu.
• 'I wasn’t expecting a comic book angle on this' news: The Oregonian reports on the ‘potential’ for items to have gone missing from Portland State University Library’s Dark Horse Comic Collection, following the occupation of Millar Library by students protesting the continued killing of Palestinians in Gaza – the protest also reportedly included the brief repositioning of a collected edition of Frank Miller’s Sin City.
• Comics website news: Popverse announced that Graeme McMillan has been promoted to the role of Editor for the site; and Multiversity Comics’ editorial team announced that May 2024 will be the site’s final month of operation, citing rising costs of running the website, a decline in writing staff, and general burnout, bringing to a close Multiversity’s 15 year run on the comics internet.

This week’s reviews.
TCJ
Tegan O’Neil reviews the metafictional shift of Luke Healy’s Self-Esteem and the End of the World - “We’re used to hearing by now, already, the strangely ubiquitous strain of magical thinking that projects a preoccupation with ecological breakdown as simply a coping strategy to avoid thinking about another, more tangible breed, of real problems. On the other hand, at the end of the day, we’re still responsible for ourselves, until the end of the world and beyond.”

This week’s interviews.
TCJ
Luke Burns interviews Pierre La Police about comedic influences, the decision to work pseudonymously, and planning gallery exhibitions of your work - “As a child I found a refuge in the act of drawing, writing, sculpting, making collages and little films. It’s what I continue to do today, except that it’s in the context of a more deliberate process. I was lucky to be able to follow this path and complete my autodidactic education by studying art. What interests me about comics is that they allow for an amplification of the power of words and of images by inserting a dimension that transcends them both.”

This week’s features and longreads.
• Here at TCJ Hagai Palevsky decodes the Curses of Kevin Huizenga and George Wylesol, considering the evolution of both cartoonists’ work through the lens of these recent (re)collections - “And here we have the difference between the two cartoonists at hand: if George Wylesol's Curses is about authorial fear being granted the catharsis of articulation, then Kevin Huizenga's Curses is about authorial curiosity sublimated into wonder.”
