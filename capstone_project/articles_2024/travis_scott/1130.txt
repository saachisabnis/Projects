With both the NBA Finals and NHL Finals for this year officially in progress, as well as the French Open having just wrapped up over the weekend, there’s plenty of high-stakes sports action to follow. Though there’s no shortage of sneaker releases to keep track of too as New Balance, Jordan Brand, Vans and Nike are back with another exciting list of launches for this week. However, prior to giving you the full rundown on what drops to have an eye on, let’s review what headlines were key to this past week of footwear news.
It may not have been a big week for Nike-related news, with an in-hand look at the Air Max Sunder serving as the sole point of focus, but its Jumpman team was discussed plenty. The latest Travis Scott x Jordan Brand updates included a Boston Celtics-inspired colorway of the Jordan Jumpman Jack that Scott rocked courtside at Game 2 of the NBA Finals, as well as word that this year’s Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG “Black Olive” is being replaced by a “Medium Olive” pair instead. Additional rumors pointed to the return of both the Air Jordan 5 “Grape” and the Air Jordan 4 “White Cement” next year as well.
As for the rest of the industry, adidas had its hands full with a myriad of YEEZY drops — featuring everything from the YEEZY BOOST 350 “Pirate Black” to the YEEZY BOOST 350 V2 “Zebra.” Elsewhere, the Three Stripes launched a Canada-exclusive giveaway for four Tim Hortons-inspired pairs of Sambas for National Donut Day while word of the adidas Kobe 2 returning in 2025 hit the net too. Additional collaboration-oriented updates included the release of the Action Bronson x New Balance 1906R “Scorpius” and the reveal of Balenciaga and Under Armour’s spring 2025 footwear collection.
Now that you’re up to speed with the latest and greatest from the sneaker space, let’s dive into what drops to consider copping in the next seven days. After that, be sure to hit up HBX to shop styles that are available now.

Release Price: $140 USD
Where to Buy: New Balance and HBX
Why You Should Cop: It’s been well over a year since Stone Island and New Balance teamed up to take on the 574 Legacy silhouette. Now, the duo is back with two new takes on the sneaker. Drawing inspiration from archival Stone Island looks, the shoe sports a silicone “N” logo at each side of the sneaker while Stone Island’s iconic compass motif appears in patch form at the tongue. Its ripstop and nubuck build hosts color arrangements of “Light Green with Mustard Gold” and “Dark Green with Brown,” as the hues deliver high and low levels of contrast respectively.

Why You Should Cop: Nina Chanel Abney participated in Jordan Brand’s push of the Air Jordan 2 in 2022 — offering both low and high-top designs that featured a unique material composition. Now, she’s returned to present the Air Jordan 3 in an eye-catching “Bicoastal” green that sees everything from canvas to chenille spread across the shoe. The artist’s special detailing includes the recreation of traditional Nike Air and Jumpman branding in her own art style, giving the pair a fun twist.

Release Date: June 13
Release Price: TBC
Where to Buy: Supreme
Why You Should Cop: Supreme and Vans are back with another blast from the past — presenting a custom version of the retro Sid silhouette in three colorways. On top of this throwback, the two have revisited Supreme’s rebellious “Fuck Em!” motif, which the two notably used ten years ago on the Era and Sk8-Hi. This time around, the Sid utilizes a suede upper combined with a leather lining while being backed by a skate-ready vulcanized waffle outsole. On top of the aforementioned motif located at the lateral midfoot, tonal Supreme branding is embroidered at the heel in the colorways of blue, red and black.

The sought-after sneaker was then reissued in 2016 via a Kith collaboration and is now set to return once again. Its leather upper sees a light brown accompanied by a soft pink at both the Swooshes and the rubber outsole. White rounds things out at the typical AF1 midsole, as well as the laces, tongue and lining.

Each look is covered in references to the respective artists, resulting in fitting tributes to all three producers.

Where to Buy: SNKRS
Why You Should Cop: The Air Jordan 4 has been shining all year as one of Jordan Brand’s most sought-after silhouettes. Now, it’s literally shining with a new “Oxidized Green” colorway that sees its uppermost portion of the midsole, wings and the heel’s Jumpman branding sport a metallic finish in the green hue, matching the green of the tongue branding and lining. Elsewhere, white occupies the remainder of the leather upper and a majority of the sole unit as off-white and gray join in around the Air window.

Each pair features layers of gray that nod to San Francisco’s fog — where HUF was founded. Staying true to the originals, everything from the cracked leather mudguard to the color composition has been carefully recreated, save for the tongue and sockliner branding that now features HUF hits alongside the Nike ones.

Release Date: June 15

Why You Should Cop: The Jumpman team is no stranger to presenting its classic silhouettes in denim arrangements. It most notably teamed up with Levi’s in 2018 for a denim take on the Air Jordan 4 and has now equipped the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG in a “Denim” finish. This time around, it keeps the denim inclusion to the overlays, though notably sees it bleed onto the canvas base to create a unique aging effect that wears in like your favorite pair of jeans.

Staying true to the originals, everything from the cracked leather mudguard to the color composition has been carefully recreated, save for the tongue and sockliner branding that now features HUF hits alongside the Nike ones.

Why You Should Cop: The Jumpman team is no stranger to presenting its classic silhouettes in denim arrangements. It most notably teamed up with Levi’s in 2018 for a denim take on the Air Jordan 4 and has now equipped the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG in a “Denim” finish. This time around, it keeps the denim inclusion to the overlays, though notably sees it bleed onto the canvas base to create a unique aging effect that wears in like your favorite pair of jeans.

Why You Should Cop: Supreme and Vans are back with another blast from the past — presenting a custom version of the retro Sid silhouette in three colorways. On top of this throwback, the two have revisited Supreme’s rebellious “Fuck Em!” motif, which the two notably used ten years ago on the Era and Sk8-Hi. This time around, the Sid utilizes a suede upper combined with a leather lining while being backed by a skate-ready vulcanized waffle outsole. On top of the aforementioned motif located at the lateral midfoot, tonal Supreme branding is embroidered at the heel in the colorways of blue, red and black.

Why You Should Cop: It has been 23 years since Nike brought forth the Air Force 1 Low in this “Linen” look as a release exclusive to Japan.

Its leather upper sees a light brown accompanied by a soft pink at both the Swooshes and the rubber outsole. White rounds things out at the typical AF1 midsole, as well as the laces, tongue and lining.

Elsewhere, white occupies the remainder of the leather upper and a majority of the sole unit as off-white and gray join in around the Air window.
