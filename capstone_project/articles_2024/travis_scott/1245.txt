Michael Jordan’s fifth Air Jordan sneaker will celebrate its 35th anniversary in 2025 and while there are plenty of anticipated releases lined up for the model, its predecessor is also primed to have a huge year. In addition to several already expected Air Jordan 4 launches, reports of a new colorway have surfaced.
According to leaker @zsneakerheadz, the Air Jordan 4 Retro will take on a new “Cave Stone” look in the new year. In-hand images of the new style have not yet surfaced, and thus only a speculative mock-up graphic is available, but it offers an idea of what the shoe should look like. 

 









The pair will mix a dark “Cave Stone” brown shade with a lighter “Moon Particle” tan that is expected to cover the model’s mudguard. Accents are minimal, with black filling in the technical portions of the shoe including the midsole, mesh netting and the TPU support “wings” which are integrated with the laces.

The relatively restrained “Cave Stone” colorway is already drawing comparisons to Travis Scott’s coveted Air Jordan collaborations including his friends-and-family exclusive “Mocha” Air Jordan 4 and the upcoming “Dark Mocha” Jumpman Jack sneaker, the latter of which debuted at ComplexCon and is expected to receive a wider release before the end of the month. 
Other noteworthy Air Jordan 4 Retros slated for ’25 include two new Nike SB colorways as well as the return of the coveted “Black Cat” iteration and the original “White Cement” style. Perhaps the most anticipated of them all is the public launch of the legendary Undefeated collaboration, of which only 72 pairs were released during its original 2005 run. The Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 sold for almost $50,000 during a 2022 Sotheby’s auction.
Although it’s nearly a year away, the Air Jordan 4 Retro “Cave Stone” is currently set to be released on Sept. 6 for a retail price of $215. This story will be updated with official details as they are announced.
