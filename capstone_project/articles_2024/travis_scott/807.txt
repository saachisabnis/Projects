Future and Metro are teasing fans once again about their new album. However, this time, the duo is adding another artist into the mix: Travis Scott. The producer uploaded an eight-second snippet of a song unofficially titled "Cinderella."
"Hot chocolate cinderella,” Metro captioned the clip of him dancing to the song, which he posted to X (formerly known as Twitter). Future is also seen in the background of the clip.
Fans loved the snippet and are begging for the artists to release the track.
"DROP IT PLEASE METRO IM BEGGING," one fan wrote.
"ITS TIME," another fan wrote. 
"Cinderella finally dropping," a fan responded referring to the multiple times it's been teased.
Scott played the track which he referred to interchangeably as "Cinderella" and "Family Forever" at an event in November. In the clip, you can hear the Future recite the lyrics:
"Strapped up with heavy metal (On God)Sip lean, talk to the devil/Hi-Tech, stay confidential/AP a Presidential/Never go against the ghetto."
The last update about the album arrived shortly before Christmas. On Saturday (Dec. 23), Future took to his Instagram Story with a repost of a May X post reading, "Pluto x Metro." Pluto is the name of Future's debut album and a nickname for the rapper after its success.
The post also reads: "Album [is] on the way [eagle emoji]."
A couple of days before Future, Metro also shared his excitement for the upcoming album.
"Coming Soon [eagle emoji x3]," the Grammy-nominated producer tweeted on Tuesday (Dec. 19) with a photo of Future in the studio attached.
The producer did not give an exact date on when fans should expect the album.
The two have worked together several times over the years, including "Mask Off," "Wicked," and "Low Life." The duo has also worked with Drake on "Jumpman" and "Where Ya At."
