The announced attendance at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas for Monday’s WWE RAW TV tapings was 13,907. That was a legitimate sellout.
Rapper Travis Scott was backstage at Monday’s WWE RAW TV tapings.
And finally, Bayley has been saying for months now that she wants the band Paramore to play her to the ring at WrestleMania 40 for her WWE Women’s Championship match with IYO SKY.
Speaking on a recent edition of the “Xfinity Hangout” podcast, the former Damage CTRL leader revealed that she’s asked about making her special entrance happen. She said,
“Honestly, yeah, because I am going to fight for it. I’ve already brought it up. I just don’t know what their schedule is like these days. It feels like they’re taking time off, but they just put out a new video, so maybe not.”
She continued, “I would love for them to play ‘Simmer.’ During the pandemic, Hayley’s solo album came out, and I was listening to that all the time. ‘Simmer’ would pump me up. Let’s do some ‘Simmer’ into my theme. I don’t know, I don’t care, you can play anything you want, I’ll come out to it. I’m really trying. Keep petitioning and tweeting about it.”
