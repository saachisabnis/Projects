Sexyy Red has has reacted to a viral video of Owen Wilson watching her perform at Rolling Loud Miami.
While the St. Louis native put on one of the festival’s most raved-about sets that included a raucous rendition of her “Sticky” collaboration with Tyler, The Creator, some of the spotlight was inadvertently stolen by Wilson.

A hilarious clip that circulated social media over the weekend showed the Wedding Crashers star standing in the crowd and frozen in a trance while watching Sexyy strut her stuff on stage.
The “Pound Town” hitmaker soon caught wind of the viral moment and responded on social media, writing: “Dats my baby Owen [kissing cats emojis].”

Wilson was a frequent fixture at Rolling Loud Miami this year as he was also brought out as a surprise guest by Travis Scott during his headlining set on Saturday (December 14).
The 56-year-old riled up the already rage-ready crowd by introducing “FE!N” and yelling into the mic: “I’m fiending for more!”

A synopsis for the movie reads: “Inspired by a true story, Rolling Loud follows an overprotective father (Wilson) who makes a bold parenting decision when he sneaks his 13-year-old son into the world’s largest Hip Hop music festival, setting off a chaotic adventure with his reckless co-worker (Matt Rife) and an eccentric festival volunteer as they navigate wild crowds, security, and their own family dynamics,” according to Deadline.
Elsewhere at Rolling Loud, Playboi Carti premiered a number of tracks from his upcoming third album I Am Music.
