Travis Scott took to social media to post three simple letters after he was arrested on Thursday morning in Miami: “Lol.”
Lol
The cryptic tweet came after the rapper was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center at 4:35 a.m., according to information from the Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Department. He’s now facing charges of trespassing after a warning and disorderly intoxication.
A Miami Beach Police Department arrest report said officers had responded to a disturbance and found Scott involved in some kind of dispute on a yacht, according to Deadline. The rapper had a “strong smell of alcohol” and obeyed police when they told him to leave the dock, though he was “yelling obscenities to the occupants of the vessel as he walked away,” according to the report.

He allegedly tried to go back to the yacht a few minutes later and became “erratic” when he wasn’t allowed to do so. “The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated: ‘It’s Miami,’” the report noted.
Scott—whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster II—submitted a $650 bond and was released from the jail. His arrest comes just a few days before he is due to head out on his international Circus Maximus stadium tour, which kicks off in the Netherlands on June 28.
