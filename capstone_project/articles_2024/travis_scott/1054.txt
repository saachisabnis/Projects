Suits was a hit for Netflix in the US last year
US broadcaster NBC has handed a series order to Suits: LA, its spin-off from the popular legal drama, which shot back to prominence last summer when it was acquired by Netflix in the US.
Created by Aaron Korsh, who was also behind the original, Suits: LA stars Stephen Amell (Arrow) as a former New York federal prosecutor who has reinvented himself representing some of the most powerful clients in LA. As his firm faces a crisis, he must embrace a role he held in contempt for his entire career just to survive.
The project is produced by Hypnotic Films with Universal Studio Group’s UCP serving as the studio. NBC has not yet confirmed when it will premiere.
Executive producers on the project include Hypnotic’s David Bartis and Doug Liman, as well as Gene Klein and Korsh. In addition to Amell, the cast includes Josh McDermitt, Lex Scott Davis, Bryan Greenberg and Troy Winbush.
The full series order comes after NBC ordered a pilot in February and began filming it in Vancouver the following month.
The original version of Suits ended five years ago after nine seasons on USA Network.
Elsewhere, NBC gave a series greenlight to Grosse Pointe Garden Society, about four very different members of a suburban garden club who get caught up in murder and mischief as they struggle to make their conventional lives bloom.
The project, which is produced by Minnesota Logging and Universal Television, is written and executive produced by Jenna Bans and Bill Krebs, who both have overall deals with Universal Television. Director Maggie Kiley is also an exec producer, along with Casey Kyber.
The show stars Melissa Fumero, AnnaSophia Robb, Ben Rappaport, Matthew Davis, Alexander Hodge, Aja Naomi King, Nancy Travis and Felix Avitia.
