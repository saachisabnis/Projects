Just as things were slowing down a bit, the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG ‘Velvet Brown’ drops. Coming just weeks after the ‘Medium Olive,’ the devil might work hard, but the big Swoosh's collab department works harder.
Rumours of the ‘Velvet Brown’ began spreading all the way back in January this year, but after months of waiting, the hotly anticipated trainer was nowhere to be found. There were even reports suggesting that the drop was cancelled altogether. But thankfully, all of that turned out to be fake news, as the Utopia artist's ninth (!) take on the silhouette has now been confirmed by the powers that be.

Landing in the Texas-born rapper's signature earthy colour palette, this Air Jordan 1 Low OG features an all-suede build in a ‘Dark Mocha’ shade. Like a lot of his other Jordan Brand collabs (the Jumpman Jack from April is one), the leather Swoosh has been flipped back-to-front on one side, while the alternate faces the normal way.
Cactus Jack emojis are stitched around the heel, and the sneaker rests on top of a chocolatey midsole that's infused with Nike Air tech for added comfort and bounce. The ‘Velvet Brown’ comes with brown laces by default, but Scott has kindly add a few extra pairs in the box just so you can switch 'em up a bit.

As well as the ‘Velvet Brown,’ Travis Scott will be releasing even more Jordans over the next few months, including the ‘Pink Pack’ and a follow-up to the Fragment Design collab from three years ago. Y'know, the pair that Ben Affleck just won't stop flexing. So if you're a big fan, your bank account's about to be in a whole world of pain.
The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG ‘Velvet Brown’ is set to release on December 21 at Nike, the Snkrs app, and select stockists worldwide for £145.
