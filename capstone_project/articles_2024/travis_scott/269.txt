There's no money like show money and dozens of rappers are hitting the road on tour in 2025.
Touring has been the lifeblood for many hip-hop artists over the years as it gives them the opportunity to get in front of their fan base, promote new music and stack some coin in the process. Following a lull after the pandemic, live shows have been back in full swing and 2025 looks to be a big year to see some of your favorite rappers live and in the flesh.
Coming off his chart-topping Chromakopia album, Tyler, The Creator already hit the road for the first part of his Chromakopia World Tour stateside. He'll hit Europe then return back to the U.S. this summer with Lil Yachty and Paris Texas, who join Tyler on the massive tour, his biggest jaunt to date. Kendrick Lamar is also on the road in promotion of his new GNX album. Dot has taken his former labelmate SZA to perform on the Grand National Tour, which is already breaking records. Other big acts hitting the road in 2025 include Chris Brown (Breezy Bowl XX Stadium World Tour) and The Weeknd (After Hours Til Dawn Tour).
Some artists have already wrapped up major tours, including Drake, who took his talents to The Land Down Under on the Anita Max Win Tour, Lil Wayne, ScHoolboy Q, Denzel Curry, Cordae and others.
