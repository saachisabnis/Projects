 Kourtney Kardashian and her husband Travis Barker are celebrating another birthday in their family!

 On Friday, the couple shared birthday tributes to Barker's stepdaughter, Atiana De La Hoya, whom he shares with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.

 “Happy birthday @atianadelahoya you bring so much joy to my life!” Kardashian, 44, wrote on her Instagram Story over a photo of her and De La Hoya posing together outdoors at night. “You’re a dream!! 🤍you!” 

 Proud dad Barker, meanwhile, wrote on his Instagram Story, “Happy Birthday @atianadelahoya. Love you Bopti 🥳,” referring to his nickname for his stepdaughter.

 The Blink-182 drummer, 48, posted a photo alongside his message that showed a lounge area with silver balloons positioned under an arch. The display spelled out, “ATI 25” in large letters and numbers, as more balloons decorated the floor. 

 Barker also shared a glimpse of what appeared to be De La Hoya's birthday celebrations as he posted a second snap of her posing at a dining table with a group of friends. “Love you Bopti 🥳,” he wrote again in the caption, also tagging his stepdaughter. 

 Kardashian and her rocker husband welcomed their first child together, son Rocky Thirteen on Nov. 1, 2023. The pair have a blended family, with the Lemme founder sharing sons Mason, 14, and Reign, 9, and daughter Penelope, 11, with ex Scott Disick, while Barker shares stepdaughter De La Hoya and daughter Alabama Luella, 17, son Landon Asher, 19, with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.
De La Hoya is the daughter of Moakler and former professional boxer Oscar De La Hoya. The couple split a year after Atiana was born in 1999 and Moakler then married Barker in 2004. The rocker raised Atiana from the age of 5.

 Earlier this month, Kardashian shared her gratitude for being able to spend quality time with her children during their recent trip to Australia.

 In a post on Instagram, the Poosh founder shared a carousel of snaps that showed her followers a round of a family vacation, featuring her son Reign and daughter Penelope as they sat in a car together, as well as a picture of her 3-month-old son Rocky's foot on an airplane.

 "Feeling so grateful for every single second of time with my babies," the proud mom wrote in her caption. "Rare to get 2 full weeks of 24/7 time as they get older! Thank you Australia for the beautiful memories (minus the spiders)."

 The post followed Kardashian and her kids' time Down Under as they joined Barker on his band's tour of Australia and New Zealand.
