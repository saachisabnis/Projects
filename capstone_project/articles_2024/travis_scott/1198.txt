Future and Travis Scott have big plans to travel to the “South of France” — at least aurally, as that’s the title of a collab set to end up on Future’s upcoming Mixtape Pluto.
Scott teased the song on his X account on Friday (September 6), where the audio was accompanied by video of the two stars, joined by Southside, flexing on a yacht in what appears to be the titular region.

While no release date has been confirmed for Mixtape Pluto, the rapper’s Freebandz website says it is “bout to drop” and directs fans to pre-save the project on their preferred streaming platform.
Future has been teasing Mixtape Pluto for a while now and recently got fans excited that Pharrell was involved in the project.

The duo posed for a picture that was posted online by Skateboard P’s longtime collaborator Mick the Ruler last month, along with the caption: “Neptune Pluto.”
The “March Madness” hitmaker previously offered a promising update in May, writing on social media: “I can’t sleep until it’s complete #MIXTAPEPLUTO.”

It was originally presumed that the mixtape would drop on May 10, but that date came and went without any music.
When teasing the May 10 release date, Pluto took a shot at an unnamed rival by tweeting: “Fuck yo album Shit ain’t slappin like my MIXTAPE.”

The post interpreted by many as a shot at Gunna, whose One of Wun album was already scheduled to arrive on May 10.
However, Future’s tweet was later revealed to merely be a promo for his “Swear to God” collaboration with Tee Grizzley, which contains the lyrics: “Fuck your album, shit ain’t slappin’ like my mixtape.”

Mixtape Pluto will mark the trap titan’s third full-length offering of 2024 following his two successful joint albums with Metro Boomin, We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You.
Both albums debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with the former racking up over 250,000 first-week sales, making it one of the highest-selling rap albums out the gate this year so far.
